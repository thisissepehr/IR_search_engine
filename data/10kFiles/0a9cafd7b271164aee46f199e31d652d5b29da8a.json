METHODS AND MATERIALS: We review amassing evidence to help guide the management and timing of brachytherapy for gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers. Where concrete data could not be found, peer-reviewed expert opinion is provided. RESULTS: There may be a significant negative impact on oncologic outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies who have a delay in the timely completion of therapy. Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes. If a treatment delay is expected, endocrine therapy may be an appropriate temporizing measure before delivery of radiation therapy. The use of shorter brachytherapy fractionation schedules will help minimize patient exposure and conserve resources. CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy remains a critical treatment for patients and may shorten treatment time and exposure for some. Reduced patient exposure and resource utilization is important during COVID-19. Every effort should be made to ensure timely brachytherapy delivery for patients with gynecologic malignancies, and endocrine therapy may help temporize treatment delays for breast and prostate cancer patients. Physicians should continue to follow developing institutional, state, and federal guidelines/recommendations as challenges in delivering care during COVID-19 will continue to evolve. \u00d3",

For patients with symptoms concerning for COVID-19, or who have already tested positive, we recommend following the local clinic and/or hospital treatment policies and procedures given the unique resources of each institution. Delay of treatment until a negative COVID-19 test may be indicated to protect the patient and the treating team, and to maintain access to care for all other patients treated at that facility. Given this, the purpose of the following commentary is to highlight the importance of timely brachytherapy (BT) treatment for patients with breast, prostate, and gynecologic malignancies and provide a framework for clinical practice and management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Cervix During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to recognize that prolongation of the treatment duration has been shown to negatively impact tumor control outcomes through tumor repopulation (3). Fyles et al retrospectively assessed the impact of overall treatment time (external beam RT, EBRT, and BT) on pelvic control in patients with FIGO Stage I-IV cervical cancer. Over 800 women were included and the median treatment time (weekends excluded) was 36 days. The authors found that every delay in treatment of 1 day over the median was associated with a 1% loss of pelvic control (4). In a similar retrospective study by Petereit et al., in 209 patients with FIGO Stage IB-IIIB cervical cancer who received EBRT and BT, the median duration of treatment was 55 days (duration included planned weekend breaks). They found that pelvic control (87% vs 72%, p 5 0.006) and 5 year survival (65% vs 54%, p 5 0.03) varied between treatment duration ! 55 days and duration $55 days, respectively (5). This study also identified time between EBRT and initiation of BT as the most common cause of treatment prolongation (combined with holidays). Several other studies confirmed that treatment prolongation over 55 days ($8 weeks) adversely affected pelvic control in cervical cancer, and each additional day over this threshold was associated with~1% decrement in both pelvic control and overall survival (OS) (6,7). The effect on tumor control and survival was examined by Song et al. in the era of concurrent chemotherapy. In a retrospective review of 113 women with FIGO Stage IB2-IIIB cervical cancer, the authors found that time to completion of therapy (EBRT plus BT) O 56 vs # 56 days was associated with pelvic failure rate of 26% vs 9% ( p 5 0.04). Therefore, even with concurrent chemotherapy, prolongation of the total treatment interval remains an essential factor impacting pelvic control (8, 9) . Finally, recent data from retroEMBRACE published by Tanderup et al. (9) in 488 women with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with chemotherapy and EBRT plus image-guided BT showed that overall treatment times (OTT) # 7 weeks resulted in 3-year local control (LC) rates of O86e94%. OTT was found to be significantly associated with LC and an additional 5 Gy was required to compensate for loss of LC due to an increase of OTT beyond 7 weeks.",

Likewise, Fabrini et al. (11) investigated the impact of the interval between surgery and initiation of radiation in 177 patients with endometrial cancer. They found a significantly increased rate of local recurrence associated with a O9 week interval between surgery and radiation (11% vs 0%, p 5 0.046). Cattaneo et al. (12) found that delay in the time to initiation of radiation after hysterectomy with or without lymph node dissection in women with uterine carcinomas $9 weeks was associated with worse recurrence free survival (39% vs. 90%, p ! 0.001). Finally, a large, retrospective NCDB analysis reviewed the records of 16,520 patients with endometrial cancer for the impact of treatment interval on OS.

The use of BT as adjuvant therapy is an alternative for select patients with an early-stage breast cancer. Consensus statements and guidelines have been published by ASTRO (24) , the American Brachytherapy Society (25) , and the American Society of Breast Surgeons (26) . Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an accepted standard of care for patients who fall into appropriate categories per guidelines. In the setting of singleentry intracavitary devices, timing is predicated by technical factors, primarily the presence of a seroma cavity in which to place the device. In general, it is the best practice to place the catheter and begin treatment within 4 weeks of breast-conserving surgery (BCS). With a multicatheter interstitial approach, the timing of BT is less dependent on the presence of a seroma cavity, and therefore falls in line with timing of external beam. For patients with DCIS radiation can be safely delayed up to 12 weeks after BCS (27) . For patients with invasive disease, there are mixed data regarding timing of adjuvant treatment. Some studies show that RT treatment delay of 8e12 weeks after BCS was associated with inferior local control (28) , and a large systematic review of 46 studies showed local recurrence rates to be significantly higher in patients receiving adjuvant RT more than 8 weeks after surgery compared with those treated within 8 weeks (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.21e 2.16) (29) . Other studies have shown that intervals up to 20 weeks may be safe and have no detriment to local control or OS for some patients without adverse tumor control or survival outcomes (30e34).",

The largest of these studies involving surgery examined 3969 prostatectomy patients who underwent surgery within 1 year of diagnosis (36) . It found no impact by time from biopsy to surgery on biochemical recurrence after a mean followup of 5.4 years; this remained true even when they examined the subset of higher risk patients. Similarly, the largest study on RT examined 1322 patients who underwent EBRT alone (39) . They found no difference in OS, cause-specific survival, distant metastasis, or freedom from biochemical failure based on time to treatment (!3, 3e6, 6e9, or O 9 months after diagnosis). They also found no difference in freedom from biochemical failure or distant metastasis in high-risk patients. Based on these studies, and others (41) , the safe interval of postponement until definitive treatment may be 6e12 months. Even if there is a true detriment in cancer outcomes with postponement of therapy that is not fully captured by these studies.

A vaginal cuff boost after EBRT is of limited additional benefit, and in the setting of COVID-19, should be restricted to the highest-risk patients (i.e., cervical invasion or positive surgical margins).

As endometrioid precancerous lesions arise from the prolonged exposure of the endometrium to estrogen, progestins can act to inhibit endometrial proliferation and are used in the management of low risk or surgically inoperable women with endometrial cancer (89) . These agents can be used continuously for 3e6 months with reassessment for response every 6 months. If by 12 months there is not a complete response, definitive surgery should be pursued. A systematic review by Gunderson in 2012 indicated that 53% of women experience a durable response to treatment with recurrence occurring in almost after response occurring in 35.4% of women with invasive disease (90) . A recent meta-analysis compared mechanism of progestin administration, either via levonorgestrel IUD or oral cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate and found that the levonorgestrel IUD had a higher response rate that the oral formulation in nonobese women (91) . Finally, a small Japanese prospective trial published in 2007 including 28 women with Stage 1A endometrial cancer demonstrated a similar response rate of 55% to that demonstrated in retrospective studies in women with Stage 1A disease (92) .",

If a delay is anticipated, the treating physician should make alternative plans as early as possible and consider referral, if necessary, to another facility equipped and staffed to deliver treatment with minimal to no disruption in the treatment timeline. There are many potential reasons for treatment delay beyond physician-centric issues, Table 2 .
