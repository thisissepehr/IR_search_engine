After 3 days, she was transferred to a tertiary center for oncologic assessment. There, her physical examination was concerning for a tender right axillary lymph node and hepatosplenomegaly. A chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse airspace opacities. PCR studies identified both rhinovirus and mycoplasma in nasal pharyngeal swabs. Twenty-four hours after arrival she developed hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

This second mutation was located in the splice donor site of exon 20, and the A > G change at this position would likely cause splicing error. It was unclear if this represented a compound heterozygous mutation or if the two variants were on a single chromosome. Parental testing was initiated. Given the genetic results and her persistent symptoms, the laboratory and bone marrow evaluations for HLH were reconsidered. Investigations relevant to HLH before, during and after anakinra use were evaluated (Tables 1 and 2) . When compared to the initial assessment, there was subsequent marked reduction in natural killer (NK) cell function, CD107a upregulation and an elevation in soluble IL-2 (soluble CD25) receptor. Importantly, a drop in ANC ( Figure 2a ) and platelet count (Figure 2b ) was identified during the end of the anakinra trial. Children with active HLH have been noted to have elevated white cell and platelet counts initially that decrease over time [6] , as illustrated in our case. As a confounding feature, however, cytopenia is an uncommon but known side effect of anakinra. It is thus possible that addition of anakinra in our patient, with underlying MUNC 13-4 mutations, magnified the drop in platelet count and ANC that would have been seen with HLH alone. In addition, when ferritin was measured on the 15 th day of anakinra therapy, the level was 629 ng/mL (above the aforementioned acceptable limit of 500 ng/mL), whereas one day after anakinra treatment was terminated, the ferritin level increased to 7129 ng/mL ( Figure 2c ).

Laboratory similarities include depressed natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic function, elevated soluble IL-2 receptor levels and soluble CD163.

Despite awareness of the diagnostic criteria, HLH diagnosis can be challenging because of the variability in presentation. Symptoms, especially if infection associated, may spontaneously remit [3] . Individual diagnostic criteria can be observed at distinct points in the disease course and can also remit and recur. Moreover, many of the criteria are non-specific for HLH, making it a diagnosis of exclusion in many cases. Finally, criteria such as NK cell function and genetic testing can take weeks to be finalized. Given all these challenges, it is important to consider HLH as a diagnosis both at onset and in the early stages of the disease process. In a review of familial and acquired HLH, key laboratory findings in establishing a diagnosis were identified as negative or decreased NK function as well as elevated soluble CD25 levels in all patients [16] , suggesting these studies must be evaluated early on in the clinical course. In some centers, CD107a upregulation, a marker of NK cell degranulation is used as a surrogate for NK cell cytotoxicity [17] .
