Neither in the Netherlands, nor in any other European country, there are official guidelines for the organisation and management of an orthopaedic bone bank. In the Netherlands, the recently modified 'law of security and quality for using human materials' (WVKL) dictates requirements for technical and organisational aspects for the use of human tissue and cells. The bone bank procedures include a thorough questionnaire for donor selection, extensive serological, bacteriological and histopathological examination, as well as standard procedures for registration, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of bone allografts. This article describes the organisation of an accredited bone bank and can be used as a proposition for an official guideline or can be useful as an example for other orthopaedic bone banks in Europe.",

A unique registration code is allocated to each femoral head. Only the bone bank administrator is able to trace the donor based on this code. Of every registered femoral head, a file, containing the consent forms and results of ESR, bacteriological and histopathological examination, is kept updated. Other relevant data, such as the size of the femoral head and the allocation date are also documented and stored in this file. When the file is completed (which takes at least 6 months due to the serological examination), and no abnormalities are recorded, both bone bank administrator and the responsible orthopaedic surgeon sign the forms. The femoral head is now available for transplantation. In case a file cannot be completed in full, or any Individuals who stayed in a SARS epidemic area or individuals who had face-to-face contact with a SARS patient abnormal values are recorded, the femoral head will be destroyed according to hospitals' protocol.",

In order to exclude malignancies, auto-immune processes, or infections, a biopsy of 1 cm 3 corticospongious bone and ligament is collected for histopathological examination. After determining its size, the femoral head is wrapped in a sterile plastic bag and in three layers parcelled in sterile packing material, labelled and stored in the freezer within 30 min. The freezer has a temperature of -80\u00b0C, and has a continuous temperature registration device installed. Should the temperature fall outside the acceptable range of -90 and -70\u00b0C, an alarm system gives off a warning signal to the Technical Service, guaranteeing a 24-h security against temperature-induced damage to the tissue. A nitrogen tank is fitted onto the freezer, as a backup cooling mechanism in case of mechanical breakdown of the freezer. In deep frozen condition, the allogenic bone tissue can be preserved for a maximum of 5 years. The temperature data is stored and managed by the bone bank administrator for a period of at least 5 years.",

From that year onwards, the use of allogenic bone transplantation has been increasingly applied and is nowadays a standard orthopaedic procedure (Tomford et al. 1987) . However, much has changed in the past decade: donor selection, clinical hygiene, storage and processing, allocation, implantation, and documentation are bound to strict rules. Donor selection takes place by a thorough broad survey and supplementary physical examination. The survey should be regularly revised to comprise the latest knowledge and developments, and as a response to the spread of new infectious diseases. For instance, after the outbreak of the SARS epidemic in certain countries, a question was added to the survey; prospective donors were asked whether they had been in SARS-infected regions or whether they had been in contact with an infected person. It is not unthinkable that newly arising infectious diseases will be included in the survey and henceforth become exclusion criteria. Laboratory examination is performed before surgery, including ESR determination. Elevated values are often encountered, often without clinical implications. However, the exclusion criteria are strictly enforced. Preoperatively, blood type and Rh-factor are determined. The Rh-factor only becomes an issue if the receiving patient is a young woman. Additionally, the donor is serologically examined, to exclude possible transmission of infections, such as HIV and hepatitis (Strong et al. 1996; Shutkin 1954; Patel and Trampuz 2004; Karcher 1997) . The serological tests are carried out at least 6 months after surgery to avoid type II error (false negative): if the patient was infected at the time of surgery, the test will provide conclusive evidence of this. Normally, the donor will not be informed of the results, unless specifically requested by the donor.",
