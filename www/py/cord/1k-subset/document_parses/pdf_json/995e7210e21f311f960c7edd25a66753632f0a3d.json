However, there is limited information on the correlation between the findings on HRCT and histological patterns in drug-associated lung disease. Data based on a small number of cases suggest that the different histological patterns of drug reaction are not reflected by distinctive HRCT findings (Cleverley et al, 2002) . *Correspondence: Professor NL M\u00fcller; E-mail: nmuller@vanhosp.bc.ca Despite these limitations, it seems reasonable to approach the radiological manifestations of drug-associated lung disease by the use of the underlying histological pattern (Ellis et al, 2000; Myers et al, 2003) . Using such an approach, the most common manifestations can be classified into diffuse alveolar damage, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, organising pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and eosinophilic pneumonia (other less common drug reactions are not discussed here). Any one histological pattern can be caused by a number of different drugs. Furthermore, similar histology is found in other conditions that are not associated with drug use, such as idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, viral, bacterial and fungal pneumonia, pulmonary haemorrhage or leukaemia and collagen vascular disease.
