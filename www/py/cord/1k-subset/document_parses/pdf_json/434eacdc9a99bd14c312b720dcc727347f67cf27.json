In this paper I explore the place and relevance of heroism in contemporary nursing. I propose that nursing heroism deserves a broader appreciation and that within the term lie many hidden, 'unsung' or 'unrecorded' heroisms. I also challenge the critiques of heroism that would condemn it as part of a 'militarisation' of nursing. Finally, I argue that nursing needs to be more open in celebrating our heroes and the transformative power of nursing achievements.",

Firemen still enter burning buildings to save their occupants and nurses still join their health care colleagues in providing care to the hungry, the fearful, the injured and the dying in both natural disaster areas and man made conflict zones. Haitian nursing students and faculty from the Episcopal University of Haiti, were setting up first aid stations to help the victims of their city 30 minutes after that country's massive earthquake [4] . Military nurses and nurses from voluntary organisations such as Red Cross and Medicine Sans Frontiers are found in every war zone, every famine-blighted country, every dictatorial wasteland, every manifestation of 'hell on earth'. We fervently wish that the circumstances that draw them away from their own families and homes to these places did not exist, but they do, and thankfully, these nurses continue to respond.",

She said that: \"There was a lot of fear among health care providers about contagion, but there was also significant prejudice and discriminatory behavior because the new disease was identified in a population that was stigmatized by the larger society. Identification of the disease in people of color, especially African Americans and injection drug users, only exacerbated the biases, prejudices, and discriminatory behavior. Many nurses demonstrated the same attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors seen in the larger society. I was a critical care nurse working in an intensive care unit (ICU) in a large teaching facility. In the early years of the epidemic, it was not unusual to have two to three patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on ventilators in the ICU at any one time. Because some nurses avoided taking care of these patients, several of us volunteered to care for them on a regular basis. There were frequent breaches in confidentiality, not only among nurses but also among other health care workers\" [7] . Gary Carr, who was a Nurse Practitioner at the AIDS Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, described the perverse ambivalence of a wider community that lauds and praises nurses for their 'heroic efforts' in the face of such public health crises. Gary says: \"I have no memories of being afraid or being brave. I just wasn't afraid. I just said to myself, this is what I want to do. This is important. The community needs this, and it's what I want to do. I remember there were people who stopped speaking to me. My mother for years didn't tell anybody what I did. My relatives for years thought I still worked in the trauma unit\" [6] .",

Dr Dessmon Tai, who led the Singapore efforts against SARS, wrote that: \"No other disease had such a phenomenal impact on healthcare workers.\" [9] But it seems that something in our professional ethos had changed over these two decades. There had been a rediscovery or reaffirmation of our professional ethic and mission as nurses, doctors and health professionals. In Hanoi, during the initial outbreak, rather than look for an 'opt-out' clause in their professional codes, doctors and nurses locked themselves into the hospital in isolation rather than risk spreading the disease [10] .",

            "text": "As Emmanuel notes: \"More than half of the first 60 reported cases of SARS involved health care workers who had come into contact with SARS patients. Indeed, apart from the very first case, all of the people who died in Vietnam were doctors and nurses. Nearly a quarter of all patients with SARS in Hong Kong were health care workers. In Canada, of the 141 probable cases of SARS diagnosed between 23 February and 14 May 2003, 92 (65%) involved health care workers. Despite deadly peril, physicians and nurses tirelessly cared for patients with SARS\". [8] However, the social stigma that surrounded HIV/AIDS twenty years earlier and the associated ambivalence of the community towards health care professionals was not so easily repressed. In Toronto, Canada, Hall and colleagues reported that: \"children of nurses were barred from school trips and families were shunned by their neighbours. Other incidents included husbands of nurses being sent home from work, children of nurses shunned at school, nurses refused rides by taxi drivers, and singleparent nurses unable to get babysitters\". [11] Similarly, in Singapore, nursing staff were reportedly shunned in public spaces, forbidden to use the lifts in their apartments, found that buses and taxis would not stop for them and as one review reported, \"At any packed food court, there would always be a seat for a Tan Tock Seng Hospital nurse. Queue lines would quickly shorten when a nurse joined that queue\". [10] These personal travails were compounded by what many saw as the unavoidable violence done to some of the best traditions of the nurse-patient relationship by the nature of the SARS virus and its containment. Nurses working with SARS patients were often isolated from collegial support, asked to eat meals alone and prohibited from attending meetings. Rigorous isolation and anti-infection procedures saw nurses, effectively in spacesuits, caring for patients in enforced cubicle isolation. If this was a terrible way to be ill, it was an even more solitary and disconnected way to die.",

The stories of heroines offer a picture of women who were far from meek and far from conciliated into male reality definitions. They were real women not mythological constructions. They shared values rather than common backgrounds and they are, to use an unfashionable term 'indomitable'. (...) The stories of the heroines of 50 years ago and more are stories of recusancy. They are stories of opposition. They are in almost every case stories of gender politics. We are deceived when we are told they are stories of female oppression. (...)

In addition, Hall and colleagues in the US reported that: \"Nursing assistants working in long-term care facilities have the highest incidence of workplace violence of any American worker\". [23] Nurses in our Emergency Departments experience perhaps even more severe episodes of violence. In Scotland, we used to joke that any particularly rough place was: \"Like casualty on a Friday night\", but it is no joke now. In a recent Australian survey from WA, Rose Chapman and colleagues found that: \"The majority (92%) of nurses said they had been verbally abused, 69% had been physically threatened and 52% had been physically assaulted\". \"Only 16% of the nurses completed an official incident report. Reasons for not reporting included the view that Work Place Violence is just part of the job, and the perception that management would not be responsive\". [24] Would Emergency Department nurses see themselves as 'heroes'? Almost certainly not, as they seem to have internalized a workplace culture where abuse and violence is not an aberration but simply something that \"comes with the job\" [25] and where reporting such abuse is scarcely worth the trouble. Perhaps if we return to the definition of heroism as 'providing service in the face of extreme personal danger', then our Emergency Department nurses should allow themselves to feel, at least somewhat heroic.",

But for many nurses, there is not merely a gap between these aspirations and clinical reality, there is a Katherine Gorge. Debra Jackson and her research team in Sydney have done some of the best Australian research in this area and it does not make for happy reading. As Debra notes: \"Currently, whistleblowing represents a professional dilemma and a personal disaster.\" [26] This observation does not only apply to nursing. Medical whistleblowers fare equally badly at the hands of their own profession [27] . Indeed in all of the whistleblowing literature, it is difficult, if not impossible to find even one person whose principled actions have NOT resulted in huge personal and professional costs.",
