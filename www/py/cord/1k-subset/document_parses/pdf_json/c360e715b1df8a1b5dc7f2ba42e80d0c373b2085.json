This capability of antigenic variation is responsible for the severe outbreaks of disease. Antigenic drift occurs by point mutations in the two genes coding for HA and NA and this causes minor changes in surface proteins. This leads to a new strain which is not recognized by antibodies to previous infl uenza strains. Antigenic shift is a major change through genetic reassortment which produces a novel infl uenza A subtype in humans. This occurs through mixing of human and animal infl uenza A virus genes or by animal to human transmission.

Typically, in Mexico, seasonal infl uenza occurs mainly from October to March and causes more serious illness in the elderly. This increase in cases in the month of March was unusual and cases were seen more among young adults. The WHO identifi ed the H1N1 virus on 15 April 2009 and declared a public health emergency on the 25 April 2009. Its rapid spread led to a pandemic alert phase 4 on 27 April which was stepped up to pandemic alert phase 5 on 29 April and phase 6 on 11 June 2009. Till 17 October 2009, 414000 laboratory confi rmed cases of H1N1 infl uenza with 5000 deaths had been reported to the WHO.
