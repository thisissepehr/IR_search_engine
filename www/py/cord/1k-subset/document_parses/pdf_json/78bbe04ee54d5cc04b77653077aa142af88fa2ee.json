The TIR domain is the defining motif of the TLR/IL-1 superfamily, and it is likely to be one of the earliest signaling domains to have evolved (17) . TLRs can recognize a diverse range of PAMPs, generate inflammatory signals to coordinate innate immune responses and modulate adaptive immune responses. The list of TLR ligands is growing. However, the ligand for TLR10 and mouse TLR8 remains unknown at present. Activation of TLRs initiates two major pathways: the MyD88-dependent pathway, which is used by all TLRs except TLR3, resulting in the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and activator protein-1 (AP-1); and the TRIF-dependent pathway, which is initiated by TLR3 and TLR4, resulting in the activation of type I interferons (IFNs) (13, 18, 19) .

In turn, the PAMPs and DAMPs act through PRRs, which include TLRs, NLRs and RLRs, to activate the innate immune system, yet they can also contribute to persistent and deleterious systemic inflammation and organ injury, including ALI.

When one considers the interactions of the innate immune system as microbes are first encountered, the value of such temporal organization is significant. For example, Gram-negative bacteria persist in tissues and, if they are not immediately killed through the activation of PMN, complement and other antimicrobial factors, they may spill out systemically and result in septic shock. Survival in the face of such infections depends on the innate immune system, which must be able to monitor and respond to pathogens over a prolonged period of time. Given the need for a prolonged response to bacterial infection, it has always seemed somewhat surprising that response to LPS is temporally finite. This endotoxin tolerance means that within hours after exposure to LPS, innate immune cells are incapable of responding again to a rechallenge (69) . But it is now clear that as LPS sensitivity wanes, the immune system has at its disposal the capability of marshaling responses via oxidative metabolites and their ability to upregulate other TLRs (70) . The subsequent means of responding to bacteria depend on the ability of the innate immune system to destroy microbes and enhance the release of alternative immune stimuli. The TLRs that are utilized are the ones that bind the constituents of degrading bacteria, such as lipopeptides, PGN, heat shock proteins and CpG DNA.

Gasse and colleagues reported that uric acid locally produced in the lung upon bleomycin (BLM)-induced DNA damage and degradation triggers NALP3 inflammasome activation, and in turn causes lung injury (146) . Reduction of uric acid levels using the inhibitor of uric acid synthesis allopurinol or uricase leads to a decrease in BLM-induced IL-1\u03b2 production, lung inflammation, repair and fibrosis. Local administration of exogenous uric acid crystals recapitulates lung inflammation and repair, which depend on the NALP3 inflammasome, MyD88 and IL-1R1 pathways and TLR2 and TLR4 for optimal inflammation but are independent of the IL-18 receptor (146) . Babelova et al., however, reported the role of biglycan, a ubiquitous LRR proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix, in mediating ALI through interacting with TLR2 and TLR4 on macrophages (147) . The study showed that in macrophages soluble biglycan induces the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome and subsequent activation of caspase-1 and release of mature IL-1\u03b2 without need for additional costimulatory factors. This is caused by the interaction of biglycan with TLR2/4 and purinergic P2 \u00d7 4/P2 \u00d7 7 receptors, which induces receptor cooperativity. Furthermore, ROS formation is involved in biglycan-mediated activation of the inflammasome. By signaling through TLR2/4 biglycan stimulates the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1\u03b2 mRNA. These results provide evidence for direct activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by biglycan and suggest a fundamental paradigm of how tissue stress and injury are monitored by innate immune receptors detecting the release of the extracellular matrix components and turning such a signal into a robust inflammatory response (147) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 296, "text": "(146)", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 736, "end": 741, "text": "(146)", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 931, "end": 936, "text": "(147)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1793, "text": "(147)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of NLR in Danger Signal-Induced ALI"}, {"text": "Susceptibility and response to infectious disease is, in part, heritable.

The approaches to modulating TLR activity have focused on the following aspects: (a) ligands or analogues such as Eritoran (E5564) from Eisai (Woodcliff Lake, NJ, USA), a synthetic analogue of bacterial lipid A that inhibits LPS from activating cells through the TLR4/CD14/MD2 complex (162) (163) (164) ; (b) monoclonal antibodies, soluble receptors and other accessory proteins, such as a natural soluble form of TLR2, found in mouse plasma and breast milk, which acts to block TLR2 ligand stimulation (165) , and a member of the TLR/IL-1 receptor family (TIR8 or SIGIRR) that inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling and may be an endogenous inhibitor of the TLR system (166); (c) signal transduction blockers; many of the key molecules in the signaling pathways for each TLR have been identified and are considered potential drug targets (167) (168) (169) . The structural bases of TIR domain interactions between TLRs and adapters such as MyD88, Mal, TRAM and TRIF have been modeled, and small peptidic sequences based on the TIR domain BB loop or peptidomimetics of this region have been made that can block the interactions (110, 169, 170) .

LPS stimulation induces NAD(P)H oxidase activation and production of ROS in PMN as well as the initiation of MyD88-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling in ECs and the consequent expression of TLR2 and ICAM-1. Adhesion of PMN to ECs is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMN to transmit oxidant signals to ECs. The oxidants augment NF-\u03baB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMN to ECs and increased PMN migration. Thus, the PMN NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated TLR4-TLR2 cross-talk activates a positive feedback signal leading to sustained and amplified endothelial activation in response to invading pathogens.

Increased GRK2 and GRK5 expression results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby negatively regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3K-\u03b3-activated signaling is postulated to be a feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. Because persistent infection requires continued PMN infiltration, LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2 internalization and thus augments PMN migration.
