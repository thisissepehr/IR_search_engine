Evidence from experimental animals indicates that mild inflammation can decrease the threshold for toxicity and thereby render an individual susceptible to an adverse drug reaction that would not otherwise occur . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria, is widely used as an inflammagen in these animal studies. A nonhepatotoxic dose of LPS can interact with nontoxic doses of several IADR-associated drugs from different pharmacologic classes to induce liver damage in rodents (Deng et al., 2006; Luyendyk et al., 2003; Waring et al., 2006; Zou et al., 2009b) .",

Since the approval of AMD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1985, the use of this drug has been associated with a variety of adverse effects, including liver dysfunction, pulmonary complications, thyroid dysfunctions, and ocular disturbance (Rotmensch et al., 1984) . The reported frequency of liver abnormalities in patients receiving AMD varies from 14 to 82% (Lewis et al., 1989) . Most of these reactions are mild, with serum transaminase elevation within threefold of the upper limit of normal (ULN), but some are more severe (Babatin et al., 2008) . Cases of liver reactions after intravenous administration of AMD are rare, but damage can be acute and marked (R\u00e4tz Bravo et al., 2005) . Fulminant hepatic failure or death associated with AMD hepatotoxicity has also been reported (Babatin et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "There is evidence that the interaction between LPS-induced cytokines and drugs or their metabolites plays an important role in the LPS-drug interaction (Zou et al., 2009a) . Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is a proximal mediator of the inflammatory cascade induced by LPS (Beutler and Kruys, 1995) and is critically involved in many models of liver injury, such as ischemia/reperfusion (Teoh et al., 2004) , alcoholic liver disease (Yin et al., 1999) and some drug/LPS-induced liver injury models (Shaw et al., 2009b; Tukov et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2009a) . As an example, TNF selectively augmented the cytotoxicity of sulindac sulfide, which is the major toxic metabolite of sulindac (Zou et al., 2009a) . In the case of amiodarone, the major metabolite of AMD is mono-N-desethylamiodarone (DEA), which shares similar pharmacological (Talajic et al., 1987) and pharmacokinetic (Shayeganpour et al., 2008) characteristics with AMD. DEA has antiarrhythmic properties, a very long half-life, and accumulates in the liver and many other tissues. In primary hepatocytes, HepG2 cells and other cell types, DEA is much more cytotoxic than AMD (Waldhauser et al., 2006) . The plasma concentration of DEA is greater in cases of AMD-associated IADRs (O'Sullivan et al., 1995) , suggesting a possible role for this metabolite in AMD toxicity.",

An effort to establish a model for AMD-induced liver injury in healthy rodents was unsuccessful. Neither short-term, large dose nor long-term, small dose administration of AMD led to observable liver damage (Young and Mehendale, 1989) . The cause of severe AMD hepatotoxicity is more likely to be a combination of AMD and other factors, e.g., inflammatory Various concentrations of (A) AMD or (B) DEA were added to cultures of Hepa1c1c7 cells together with TNF (3 ng/ml) or saline. Twenty-four hours after treatment, LDH activity released into the culture medium was measured. The percent LDH release was calculated as described in ''Materials and Methods'' section. * indicates significantly different from respective groups not given TNF; # indicates significantly different from respective groups not given AMD or DEA. p < 0.05, n \u00bc 3. episodes. In the present study, regardless of cotreatment with LPS, the serum concentration of AMD was about 1100 ng/ml, which is very close to the steady-state serum concentration of AMD in human patients (1500 ng/ml) under long-term oral amiodarone therapy (Pollak et al., 2000) . Our findings support that at this clinically relevant concentration of AMD in serum, hepatotoxicity can be induced by a concurrent inflammatory episode related to LPS exposure.",

The results of the present study expand these findings and demonstrate that a nonhepatotoxic dose of AMD is rendered hepatotoxic when acute inflammation is triggered by LPS administration. Acute increases in serum markers for hepatocellular and cholestatic injury were found in rats cotreated with AMD/LPS. These resemble the clinical hepatic chemistry changes in human idiosyncrasy during AMD therapy (R\u00e4tz Bravo et al., 2005) . The midzonal and bridging necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in AMD/LPS are also consistent with some of the histological changes found in human patients (Babatin et al., 2008; R\u00e4tz Bravo et al., 2005) . However, the histological characteristics in people with AMD-induced liver injury were variable. Different patterns of hepatocellular necrosis, such as midzonal, centrilobular, bridging, and panlobular, have been reported (Lewis et al., 1989) . Genetic differences, concurrent medications, and even different origins of inflammation might account for these varied responses; nevertheless, the AMD/LPS interaction model in rats mimics important aspects of AMD-induced IADRs in human patients.",

A minimal interval of 16 h was required for AMD and LPS to interact to induce liver injury. When LPS was injected within 16 h after AMD, no liver injury was observed. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and clearance as well as toxicological actions could contribute to this timing requirement. The elimination of AMD is primarily through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, and its half-life in plasma is very long (55 days in humans) (Pollak et al., 2000) . Accordingly, the loss of AMD due to elimination within 16 h is minimal. AMD has a dose-dependent effect on the respiratory chain and b-oxidation in the mitochondria (Fromenty et al., 1990a, b) , and it can also affect the function of lysosomes and other acidic organelles (Stadler et al., 2008) . The 16-h interval may be required for AMD to distribute into the liver, accumulate in organelles, and sensitize hepatocytes to interact with LPS or its downstream cytokines.",

AMD treatment also increased TNF production by alveolar macrophages on LPS stimulation (Punithavathi et al., 2003) . In the present study, treatment of rats with AMD alone did not cause serum TNF elevation, but it did increase the concentration of TNF in serum of LPS-treated rats. These results suggest that the increased appearance of TNF in AMD/LPS-cotreated rats was probably not an additive effect; rather, AMD appeared to potentiate the production or diminish the clearance of TNF caused by LPS. The concentration of TNF in serum increases rapidly in LPS-treated rats, peaks at around 1.5-2 h, and then returns to basal levels at around 6 h (Tukov et al., 2007) . In the present study, the concentration of TNF around the peak time (i.e., 2 h) in LPS-cotreated rats was not affected by AMD, but the TNF concentration was greater in AMD-cotreated rats at a later time (4 h). These data suggest that AMD prolonged the elevation in TNF caused by LPS administration. This seemingly small difference in TNF concentration was shown to be critical to liver pathogenesis in another drug/LPS model of liver injury involving trovafloxacin (Shaw et al., 2009b) . Accordingly, it is possible that prolongation of the LPS-induced TNF response is a critical event across models of LPS-drug interaction.",

Etanercept pretreatment reduced hepatotoxicity, indicating that TNF has an important role in AMD/LPS-induced liver injury. Because no liver injury was observed after treatment with LPS AMD HEPATOTOXICITY DURING MODEST INFLAMMATION alone, the large TNF peak caused by LPS was not hepatotoxic by itself; however, this amount of TNF could be critical for the induction of hepatocellular injury by potentiating the toxic effect of AMD and/or DEA. Signaling from an activated TNF receptor can lead to lysosomal leakage, mitochondrial damage, and caspase activation (Wullaert et al., 2007) . All three of these events were also found in AMD and DEA cytotoxicity in vitro (Agoston et al., 2003; Spaniol et al., 2001) . Further support for a critical role for TNF came from our in vitro study in Hepa1c1c7 cells in which TNF increased the cytotoxicity of both AMD and DEA. As a proximal proinflammatory cytokine, TNF can also contribute to liver damage by inducing downstream inflammatory events, such as coagulation activation and neutrophil activation (Shaw et al., 2009b; Tukov et al., 2007) . The etanercept treatment herein reduced the ALT activity to half of the level seen in the absence of this inhibitor, whereas the same dose of etanercept reduced the ALT activity almost to control level in trovafloxacin/LPS and sulindac/LPS models (Shaw et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2009a) . This suggests that other factors induced by LPS might act in parallel with TNF in the AMD/LPS model. In other models of potentiation of xenobiotic toxicity by LPS, factors such as neutrophils (Luyendyk et al., 2005) , the coagulation system (Shaw et al., 2009a) , and prostanoids (Ganey et al., 2001) play important roles, and these factors might be relevant in the model presented here.",

AMD/LPS-cotreated rats developed liver pathology and blood chemistry changes that resemble AMD-induced idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in human patients. LPS did not interact with AMD by changing the metabolism or distribution of AMD. AMD enhanced the increase in plasma TNF concentration caused by LPS, and neutralizing TNF reduced liver injury from AMD/LPS coexposure. Moreover, TNF potentiated the cytotoxicity of both AMD and DEA in vitro. These findings add support to the idea that inflammatory stress can interact with IADR-associated drugs to cause liver injury by a mechanism involving TNF and suggest that a similar mode of action might apply to several drugs that cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in humans.",
