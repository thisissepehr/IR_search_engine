Serum samples obtained every week starting from the day of admission showed clear-cut seroconversion for C. pneumoniae antibodies. All other cultures obtained during the first days of hospitalization were negative. Despite maximal ventilatory support (high positive end expiratory pressure, fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0, nitric oxide inhalation, neuromuscular blocking agents and prone positioning), our patient remained severely hypoxemic, which led us to initiate an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and hemodiafiltration were withdrawn on day 12. Our patient was extubated on day 18 and discharged from our Intensive Care Unit on day 20.

The first level test is a search by ELISA-technique for anti-major outer membrane protein (MOMP) IgG and IgA antibodies (C. pneumoniae-IgG & IgA-ELISA plus, Medac, Hamburg, Germany) which are species-specific. This permits us to screen patients. The disadvantage of anti-MOMP antibodies is their late appearance in acute primary infection (three weeks for IgA, six to eight weeks for IgG) and their considerable persistence in human serum afterwards, independent of the bacterial eradication. In general, the prevalence of C. pneumoniae IgG antibody reaches 50% in adults above 20 years of age, and 80% in the elderly population (> 70 years old). The second level test is another ELISA assay, rELISA (Medac), for the detection of genus-specific anti-lipopolysaccharide(LPS) antibodies. Chlamydiae contain, as a common immunodominant antigen, the LPS to which the first immune reaction is directed. These anti-LPSs have the main advantage of rising quickly during acute infection (five to ten days for IgA), allowing early diagnosis, and returning to normal a few weeks after the infection and are thus associated to the eradication of the bacterium [26] . The use of paired sera enables the discrimination of current infections, reinfections and reactivations (defined by titer increase) from chronic persistent ones (constant LPS, IgG and IgA antibody titers, present in 5% to 10% of the adult population) for which no antibacterial treatment is needed. The latter is due to the chronic presence of bacteria in the organism in a latent phase (monocytes).
