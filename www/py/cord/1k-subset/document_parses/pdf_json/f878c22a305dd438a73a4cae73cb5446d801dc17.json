In our study, the most common comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases (3.3%), diabetes mellitus (1.0%), respiratory diseases (2.8%), and obesity (18.5%).

In those studies, the main cause of underlying disease was asthma. A study compared asthma prevalence of Chinese adolescents living in Canada and in China. The authors found that for girls, the range of asthma was 4.3% in Guangzhou to 9.8% in Canadian-born Chinese adolescents. These results suggest that the lower prevalence of pre-existing asthma in our samples reflects prevalence of the disease in the Chinese population [21] . The mortality rate for severe or critically infected pregnant women in our study was 20%, similar to what was reported in Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand [22] [23] [24] [25] , but higher than in France (8% death in ICUhospitalized pregnancy women) [4] . Risk analysis showed that a PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264 200 and higher BMI (i.e. \u2265 30) on admission were risk factors for maternal death. Pregnancy and ARDS are associated with increased oxygen consumption, which can result in hypoxemia in the mothers and the neonates.

Among 45 patients who failed with initial NIV, 38 of them were then administered invasive ventilation, and 24 of 38 these patients died. The death rate was lower among patients who initially received NIV than those were initially intubated (24/83, 28.9% vs 43/87, 49.4%; p = 0.006).

Multivariable analyses suggested that pregnant women with pH1N1 virus complicated by septic shock (OR, 19.23; 95% CI, 1.97 to 187.13; p = 0.011) were less likely to be successfully treated by NIV (Table 3).
