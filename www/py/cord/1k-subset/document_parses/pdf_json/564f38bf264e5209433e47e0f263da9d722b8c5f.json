However, outbreaks of novel recombinant strains that take place in animals have produced, along the years, many worldwide outbreaks with serious public health issues. Although normally a self-limited process in the general population, high risk groups for complications and death have been identified (Table 1) . During an outbreak, in otherwise healthy subjects the diagnosis of influenza infection can be made confidently based on clinical manifestations alone. However, in certain situations, such as sporadic cases, in patients at an increased risk for complications, or in hospitalized patients with severe pulmonary compromise, confirmation of etiology by laboratory testing is required to guide treatment and for surveillance purposes [1\u2022\u2022, 2\u2022\u2022]. A potentially fatal complication of influenza infection is the involvement of the lower respiratory tract caused directly by the influenza virus, and the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia. Novel recombinant influenza A strains carry the risk for more severe disease and have the potential to cause widespread illness and a large number of deaths, regardless of age or previous health status. Examples of this are the H5N1 \"avian\" influenza A outbreak since 2004, and the more recent H1N1 \"swine\" influenza A pandemic in 2009, both of which have prompted the development of quick and reliable laboratory test in an effort to optimize their management and reduce morbidity and mortality.

In two retrospective studies that examined which clinical signs and symptoms are most predictive of influenza infection in patients with influenza-like illness, cough and fever were the only symptoms significantly associated with a positive PCR test for influenza [3, 4] . In another study, no isolated symptom or sign was able to accurately predict influenza infection, though the absence of fever, cough and nasal congestion significantly decreased its likelihood [5] . In general, patients diagnosed with pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus had similar signs and symptoms compared to those with seasonal influenza.

Other benefits of influenza virus detection are the reduction of inappropriate antibiotic use, decreased length of stay in emergency departments, and fewer additional laboratory studies, all leading to a reduction in health care costs [1\u2022\u2022] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have published guidelines to better define patients who should undergo influenza testing [1\u2022\u2022, 2\u2022\u2022]. The available methods include immunological techniques (i.e. rapid antigen-based tests, immunofluorescence assays, serologic testing), molecular techniques (i.e. reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]), and microbiological techniques (i.e. viral cultures). While RT-PCR has the highest sensitivity and specificity, rapid antigen and immunofluorescence testing, though very useful as initial screening tests, are considerably less sensitive. Besides, the sensitivity and specificity of any of these techniques will vary depending on the laboratory equipment, personnel expertise, the timing of recollection, and the appropriate handling of the samples [1\u2022\u2022, 2\u2022\u2022]. Respiratory specimens can be obtained by many different methods including throat swabs, nasal aspirates, and nasopharyngeal swabs, aspirates and washing [2\u2022\u2022] . In mechanically ventilated subjects, more invasive maneuvers such as endotracheal aspirates and bronchoscopic or non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be required in order to obtain adequate lower respiratory tract samples. While rapid antigen tests, immunofluorescence and RT-PCR all can yield results quick enough to guide point-of-care clinical decisionmaking, serologic tests and viral cultures provide retrospective diagnosis, availability only in reference laboratories, and usefulness when confirming screening test.

Many different FDAapproved tests are available; while some assays are capable of distinguishing between influenza A or B viruses, none can distinguish between pandemic and seasonal strains of influenza A [1\u2022\u2022, 2\u2022\u2022]. Compared to reference methods (i.e. RT-PCR and viral culture), they have low sensibility (10 % to 80 %) and high specificity (95 % to 100 %), and there is also great variability between the different commercially available kits [25] [26] [27] . Sensitivity appears to be somewhat lower for influenza B than that seen for influenza A [26] . Also, the reported sensitivity for rapid tests is higher for nasopharyngeal samples than for throat swabs [27] . There are two main factors that influence RIDT's negative predictive value. First, negative results obtained during periods of high viral activity in the community are more likely to be false negatives; alternatively, false positives, though much less frequent, are more likely during periods of less viral circulation. Second, respiratory samples collected within the first 48 to 72 h of symptom onset positively influence RIDT's sensitivity. For these reasons, when rapid tests are negative, confirmation by means of RT-PCR or viral culture should be considered [1\u2022\u2022, 2\u2022\u2022]. Compared to RT-PCR, the sensitivity of RIDTs for detecting novel influenza A (H1N1) was equal to or lower than the sensitivity to detect seasonal influenza viruses [29] [30] [31] [32] , so RIDT results need to be interpreted with caution when evaluating patients suspected of having pandemic H1N1 influenza A.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 658, "end": 662, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 663, "end": 667, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 668, "end": 672, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 876, "end": 880, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1627, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1628, "end": 1632, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1637, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1642, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests"}, {"text": "Immunofluorescence Direct (DFA) or indirect (IFA) immunofluorescence antibody staining techniques are capable of detecting influenza A and B viruses, and distinguish the viruses from each other as well as from other respiratory viruses [1\u2022\u2022, 2\u2022\u2022].

Several modalities of RT-PCR have been designed: conventional gel-based PCR (cRT-PCR), multiplex PCR (mRT-PCR), and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). They can differentiate between influenza types (A or B) and subtypes (including pandemic H1N1 influenza and avian H5N1 influenza), and results are available in 2-6 h (although due to transportation of batched specimens to reference centers for processing, it may take longer for results to be available). During the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic, it became clear that rapid case identification was essential for timely management of patients and for adequate public health actions to be taken. To answer to this threat, the CDC optimized the previously developed rRT-PCR procedures for detection of the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus [36\u2022 ]. Yang et al. compared the performance of 12 rRT-PCR primer-probe sets designed for detecting the hemagglutinin (HA) or the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus, using the primer-probe set developed at the CDC as reference. They found that although all primer-probe sets had specificity levels as high as 98.4 % to 100 %, some of the primer-probe sets had better specificity, sensitivity, and amplification efficiency than others, and that a combination of primer-probe sets targeted to the HA and NA genes had higher detection sensitivity than those targeting HA or NA individually [37] . In another study, Lam et al. showed that although rRT-PCR assays can be 10-fold more sensitive than cRT-PCR, newly developed cRT-PCR assays targeting the HA gene are a reliable alternative for laboratories where a rRT-PCR machine is not available [38] . Sensitivity and specificity of these assays also depend on the type of respiratory sample employed.

It has an elimination half-life of approximately 8 h, primarily . These side effects are usually mild and limited to the first days of treatment, although more serious side effects have been described. Oseltamivir has been linked to selfinjury and delirium in pediatric populations, although no causal association could be demonstrated [42, 43] . The use of inhaled zanamivir has been associated with bronchospasm, sometimes severe or fatal, particularly in patients with underlying airways disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma [44] . Amantadine and rimantadine target the M2 protein of influenza A, which forms a proton channel in the viral membrane that is essential for viral replication. Amantadine is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. In patients older than 65 years and in those with an estimated creatinine clearance of less than 50 mL/min, the daily dose should be reduced. Rimantadine is extensively metabolized in the liver, and dose reduction is recommended for patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min), and the elderly.

According to these recommendations, those individuals with severe disease (requiring hospitalization or with evidence of lower respiratory tract infection) or those at high risk for complications (Table 1) should receive antiviral therapy even after 48 h of symptom onset. Adults with mild illness without high risk conditions who are younger than 65 years of age do not require treatment. If such individuals present within the first 48 h of illness, antiviral treatment can be considered in order to reduce the duration of illness. In all cases, decisions to administer antiviral medications for influenza treatment should be based on clinical and epidemiologic grounds, and never be delayed because of confirmatory laboratory tests [41\u2022\u2022] . The usual dosing of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza is 75 mg orally twice daily and of zanamivir is 10 mg (2 inhalations) twice daily. The recommended duration for antiviral treatment is 5 days, although longer treatment courses for patients who fail to improve after 5 days of treatment can be considered [70\u2022\u2022] . Also, doubling the dose of oseltamivir to 150 mg orally twice daily has been suggested to be beneficial for some severely ill patients with H5N1 avian influenza [24, 67] . The FDA licensed oseltamivir for use in children 1 year of age and older in a liquid formulation at a dosage of 2 mg/kg/dose twice daily for 5 days. Zanamivir is not approved for use in children under 5.

In these cases, and in patients who are at an increased risk for influenza infection complications, confirmation of etiology by laboratory testing is required in order to guide the initiation and duration of antiviral treatment, and for the implementation of infection control measures and surveillance. Recently, the emergence of novel influenza A strains that carry the risk for more severe disease regardless of age or previous health status, has prompted the development of quick and reliable laboratory tests in an effort to optimize their management and reduce morbidity and mortality. Pneumonia related to the 2009 influenza A pandemic was found in many cases to be rapidly progressive, leading to respiratory failure which in many cases was underestimated by commonly used pneumonia severity scores. Given the limited sensitivity of RIDT and immunofluorescence assays, confirmation of pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection can only be made by rRT-PCR or viral culture. Although annual immunization is the most important preventive measure, NI are the agents of choice for chemoprophylaxis in selected high risk patients, and for treatment.
