Following implementation of the elimination plan, national vaccination coverage for first MMR dose in children at two years of age increased from 82.0% in 2003, to 89.6% in 2007.

It is likely that isolation measures and separate admission procedures were not always adopted in case of admission of a patient with signs and symptoms compatible with measles. In the first outbreak, nosocomial transmission may have been responsible for the spread of the infection from the Roma/Sinti to the Italian population. Also of concern is the fact that four healthcare professionals developed measles. As the incidence of measles declines, nosocomial transmission is likely to become an important source of infection and sustain the occurrence of outbreaks among non-immunised health staff and hospital contacts, representing a serious problem in the elimination of measles [26] .

            "text": "The described outbreaks highlight the threat represented by pockets of susceptible populations, even in the presence of good coverage levels in the overall population [27] . These groups include hard-to-reach populations (HRP) such as the Roma/Sinti communities (estimated MMR coverage in Italy below 10%,) [11] , families who refuse vaccination for ideological or religious reasons, as reported in recent outbreaks amongst students in private religious schools and orthodox communities in Europe and Israel [28] [29] [30] , and families objecting to having their children vaccinated out of concern for vaccinerelated adverse events [31] [32] [33] . The risk for the community represented by HRP or organized groups of objectors should not be underestimated and represent a more serious treat than sporadic susceptible individuals. Susceptible population groups may reintroduce indigenous measles virus transmission even in countries confirmed as disease-free or in a population with high immunization coverage [34] facilitating the transmission of the disease to susceptible individuals still present in the region. Efforts are needed to improve methods to identify areas with low coverage and to develop specific strategies which target susceptible groups. An improvement in health services delivery may be needed to reach Roma/Sinti communities and new immigrants. At the same time, more effective communication strategies should be defined to address subjects objecting to vaccination either for religious or other reasons, involving these subjects in a wider discussion on their responsibility toward the community. The implementation of catch up campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults should also be considered, with the additional objective of protecting women of childbearing age against rubella.",
