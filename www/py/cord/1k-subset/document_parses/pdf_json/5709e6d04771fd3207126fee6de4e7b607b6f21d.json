            "text": "Introduction: Multicentric Castleman's Disease (MCD), a lymphoproliferative disorder associated with Human Herpes Virus-8 (HHV-8) infection, is increasing in incidence amongst HIV patients. This condition is associated with lymphadenopathy, polyclonal gammopathy, hepato-splenomegaly and systemic symptoms. A number of small studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, in treating this condition. Case presentation: We report the case of a 46 year old Zambian woman who presented with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, confusion, lymphadenopathy, and renal failure. She rapidly developed multiple organ failure following the initiation of treatment of MCD with rituximab. Following admission to intensive care (ICU), she received prompt multi-organ support. After 21 days on the ICU she returned to the haematology medical ward, and was discharged in remission from her disease after 149 days in hospital. Conclusion: Rituximab, the efficacy of which has thus far been examined predominantly in patients outside the ICU, in conjunction with extensive organ support was effective treatment for MCD with associated multiple organ failure. There is, to our knowledge, only one other published report of its successful use in an ICU setting, where it was combined with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and prednisolone. Reports such as ours support the notion that critically unwell patients with HIV and haematological disease can benefit from intensive care.",

            "text": "The spectrum of HIV-associated disease on the ICU has changed markedly since the widespread adoption of combination antiretroviral therapy (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy, HAART) in the late 1990s. Whilst the incidence of opportunistic infections has decreased, that of several neoplasms, including Multi-centric Castleman's Disease (MCD) and Hodgkin's lymphoma is increasing. MCD is a lympho-proliferative disorder associated with Human Herpes Virus-8 (HHV-8) infection, characterised by fever, lethargy, anaemia and lymphadenopathy. Lymph node histology typically reveals angiofollicular hyperplasia and plasma cell infiltration. There is as yet no accepted therapeutic gold standard for MCD. Initial treatment approaches involved chemotherapy with agents such as vinblastine, etoposide and doxorubicin plus corticosteroids. More recently the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, has been used. This targets HHV-8-infected plasmablasts, which coexpress the B cell antigen CD20. Small case series of patients with MCD have shown rituximab to be an effective therapy in patients that do not require organ support on the intensive care unit [1] [2] [3] .",

A possible basis for this could have been the systemic manifestations of a \"cytokine storm\" associated with MCD; increased expression of IL-6 is typical of MCD. Vasopressor and inotropic support with noradrenaline and dobutamine was required to maintain an adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP). Because of rapidly escalating requirements for noradrenaline she received a continuous infusion of hydrocortisone (10 mg/h) as per local departmental protocol, to treat probable relative adrenal insufficiency. Empirical antibiotics and antifungal agents were given to treat sepsis as a potential cause for ensuing multi-organ dysfunction, and she required a continuous infusion of 20% dextrose for refractory hypoglycaemia. To treat her acute renal failure and profound metabolic acidosis (serum lactate of 18.5 mmol/L), haemofiltration was undertaken with large volume 5 litre cycles (~90 ml/kg/hour) of lactatefree replacement fluid. This strategy was adopted to target early shock reversal and removal of IL-6, increased expression of which is a hallmark feature of MCD.",

Interruption of chemotherapy usually results in clinical recurrence and most patients remain chemotherapy-dependent for life. In addition its use can be associated with cytopaenias.

In contrast rituximab is well tolerated and has been shown to be effective in case reports and series [1] [2] [3] .

The patient was originally from a country with endemic mycobacterial and fungal infection. Investigations therefore were undertaken to exclude a variety of possible causes -including disseminated mycobacterial and fungal disease, as well as lymphomalike conditions, such as MCD. Prompt diagnosis was made following lymph node biopsy. The decision to biopsy an inguinal lymph mode, rather than a cervical node was based on the clinical findings of a large and easily palpable inguinal lymph node mass. Although small volume bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy was present, this was far less clearly abnormal than the groin lymph nodes. A particular issue in HIV patients is the presence of persistent generalised lymphadenopathy, which represents an immune response directed against HIV. This typically results in findings similar to the cervical adenopathy present in this patient; and therefore neck biopsy may have in fact slowed the diagnostic process. Antiretroviral therapy was continued, but modified on the ICU. Notably the patient had been using antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for two years prior to her presentation to our service. She had had a persistently undetectable plasma HIV load (<50 copies/mL). Her nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir and lamivudine) were stopped because of their association with lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis. Although it would be surprising for this to occur after such a prolonged time on these drugs, it was important to minimise any possible mitochondrial toxicity that might have resulted from these agents; and which in turn could have contributed to acidosis. Monotherapy with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors is a useful treatment option in patients who are intolerant or resistant to other agents [8] . The approach is particularly successful in patients who have already suppressed their plasma HIV load, such as in this case.",

Corticosteroids were used empirically to treat probable underlying relative adrenal insufficiency. This occurs in up to 25% of critically ill patients with sepsis. Surviving Sepsis guidelines [9] published in 2004 do not suggest mandatory testing (by adrenocorticotrophic hormone: ACTH stimulation test) unless there is strong suspicion of undiagnosed primary adrenal insufficiency. The 10 mg/h infusion used in our patient was in line with the recommended 24 hour total dose of 200-300 mg. High volume haemofiltration was undertaken to target early shock reversal and removal of IL-6, increased expression of which is a hallmark feature of MCD. In animal studies, such a strategy is associated with improved haemodynamics and gas exchange, reduced immuno-paresis and increased survival [10] . The length of hospital stay post ICU discharge for our patient largely reflects the need for weaning from respiratory support and rehabilitation. Patients such as ours often experience profound muscle weakness (ICUacquired weakness) after mechanical ventilation on intensive care, and require intensive physiotherapy, as well as nutritional, psychological and social support.",

Rituximab is a newly-established therapy for MCD [1] . Its efficacy has thus far been chiefly demonstrated in limited studies of patients outside of the intensive care setting. Recent literature suggests ICU admission and support can be beneficial for haemato-oncological patients to facilitate specific chemotherapy [6] . Consistent with this notion, our report illustrates the benefit of ICU support during rituximab treatment for HIV associated MCD.",
