Most basic among these was confusion regarding the usage of the terms ''sensitivity'' and ''specificity,'' and the evaluations needed to measure these parameters [46] . The distinction between ''analytic'' performance characteristics, as opposed to ''diagnostic'' or ''clinical'' performance characteristics, is essential for properly assessing the validation of any assay, but it is particularly true in the field of molecular diagnostics. For NADTs, analytic sensitivity refers to the lowest concentration of target that can be detected, whereas analytic specificity measures the ability of the test to exclude undesired targets despite similar genetic sequences. In contrast, diagnostic or clinical sensitivity of a nucleic acid detection test refers to the appropriate identification of all patients carrying the agent, and diagnostic or clinical specificity describes the assay's ability to exclude uninfected patients. Clinical performance characteristics are subject to a number of factors, including the patient's disease status, variations in the concentration of the target throughout the course of illness, inhibition by other substances present in the specimen, sample quality, sampling variability, and specimen degradation. Generally, assays should be tested against a reference or gold standard. For tests of microbial detection, the reference standard typically is culture, but molecular diagnostics are often much more sensitive in detecting nucleic acid than is culture for viable organisms, leading to difficulties in interpreting the clinical relevance of false-positive results. The challenges of assessing diagnostic tests have been increasingly recognized in recent years. For instance, the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy initiative [47, 48] offers guidelines on the reporting of diagnostic studies, whereas the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies provides corresponding guidance on their evaluation [49] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 297, "end": 301, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1907, "end": 1911, "text": "[47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1915, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2098, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CHALLENGES IN THE EVALUATION OF EXISTING DATA"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, respiratory diagnostics are particularly limited by the inability to determine whether the detection of a particular pathogen in a symptomatic patient indicates that it is causative of the illness or results from contamination, colonization, or prolonged shedding from a prior unrelated infection, particularly when testing specimens from the upper respiratory tract. This issue is not typically addressed in diagnostic evaluation studies, but it has become more relevant as molecular diagnostics have expanded the lower limits of pathogen detection by several orders of magnitude. Attempts to answer this question have suggested an additional category of test performance, the ''epidemiological'' specificity of a test, to describe the ability of an assay to assign true etiologic status to a pathogen for a specific illness. Ultimately, determination of the epidemiologic specificity of a respiratory diagnostic would require the interpretation of microbiologic results in conjunction with all other clinical and laboratory data, perhaps in the form of a predictive model.

Statistical methods to adjust for such alloyed gold standards, such as discrepant analysis, have been frequently employed, but they can be susceptible to significant bias [50] .
