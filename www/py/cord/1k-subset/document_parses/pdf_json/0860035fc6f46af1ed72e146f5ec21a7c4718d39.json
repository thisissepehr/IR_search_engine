The Dictyostelia or social amoebas represent a simple form of multicellularity, where starving cells aggregate to build fruiting structures. This review summarizes efforts to provide a framework for investigating the genetic changes that generated novel morphologies in the Dictyostelia. The foundation is a recently constructed molecular phylogeny of the Dictyostelia, which was used to examine trends in the evolution of novel forms and in the divergence of genes that shape these forms. There is a major trend towards the formation of large unbranched fruiting bodies, which is correlated with the use of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a secreted signal to coordinate cell aggregation. The role of cAMP in aggregation arose through co-option of a pathway that originally acted to coordinate fruiting body formation. The genotypic changes that caused this innovation and the role of dynamic cAMP signaling in defining fruiting body size and pattern throughout social amoeba evolution are discussed.",

            "text": "The social amoebas or Dictyostelia represent one of nature's several independent inventions of multicellularity. The dictyostelia are members of the amoebazoans, a genetically highly diverse group that is the closest sister group to the clade containing the animals and fungi. (1) Except for the myxomycetes, all other known amoebazoans are microscopic unicellular organisms. The myxomycetes alternate a trophic amoeboid stage with a syncytial form. Here, a single cell with millions of nuclei, can grow up to several meters across. (2) Social amoebas also have a trophic amoeboid stage, but they achieve macroscopic dimensions by aggregation. (3) This occurs in response to starvation, which triggers regulated secretion of chemoattractant by the amoebas (Fig. 1) . Cellular agglomerates are formed, which can consist of up to a million amoebas. Sophisticated cell-cell signalling mechanisms between the amoebas orchestrate the differentiation of up to five different cell types and coordinate an intricate progression of cell movements. In combination with the synthesis of a flexible skin-like matrix, cell differentiation and cellular movement first generate the formation of a motile structure, called the ''slug''. The slug responds to chemical gradients and to light and warmth, which cause it to move to the soil's top layer. Here, the slug projects upwards and forms the fruiting body. This again involves highly ordered movement and differentiation and yields a slender column of stalk cells that bears aloft a global mass of spores. Depending on the species, the stalk can show different patterns of side branches and/or be decorated with disc, root or cup-shaped support structures (Fig. 2) . Unlike the ontogeny of sessile organisms like plants and fungi, which depends largely on series of directional cell divisions, the formation of fruiting bodies in social amoebas is more similar to the ontogeny of animal form. Both depend strongly on an intertwined program of cell movement and cell differentiation.",

            "text": "Seminal work of Raper showed similarity of principle in the establishment of the body plan in Dictyostelium and vertebrate development. In vertebrate development, a small group of cells known as ''the organizer'' releases signals that coordinate cell movement during gastrulation and neurulation and thereby generate the animal's head-to-tail body axis. (4) Raper demonstrated that, in Dictyostelium aggregates, small groups of cells, recognizable as tips, secretes signals that generate anteroposterior polarity of all or a subpopulation of cells in the aggregate, yielding one or several slugs with a distinct head and body region. (5) More recent work shows that animals and Dictyostelia share many conserved pathways for processing external signals. Particularly the elucidation of the processes that control chemotaxis in Dictyostelium have become a paradigm for understanding cell migration in animals. (6) (7) (8) However, the external signals that trigger movement or differentiation are rarely conserved. For instance, growth-factor-like peptides and their tyrosine kinase receptors that play such crucial roles in animal development are not present in Dictyostelium. The homeobox-containing transcription factors that specify segment identity in arthropods and vertebrates have only a minor function in Dictyostelium development. (9) (10) (11) The signaling repertoire of the Dictyostelia is rather different. The model species, D. discoideum makes extensive use of cyclic AMP (cAMP), the ubiquitous intracellular messenger for hormone action in vertebrates. In D. discoideum, cAMP not only mediates the effect of a number of external signals, but is also secreted to act as a chemoattractant and inducer of cell differentiation. (12) Secreted peptides trigger maturation of spores, but are detected by sensor-coupled histidine kinases. (13) Polyketide-based metabolites and adenine-based cytokinins are secreted to regulate cell-type proportioning and spore germination respectively. (14, 15) Animals, plants and Dictyostelia evolved from different unicellular ancestors, supposedly the filter-feeding choanoflagellates for animals, (16) green algae for plants (17) and solitary amoebas for the Dictyostelia. (18) These unicellular progenitors used sensory signaling to monitor their environment and to find food and mates. The different developmental strategies that are now used by their multicellular descendants reflect how evolutionary forces differentially selected, duplicated and adapted these environmental sensing mechanisms for increasingly complex communication between cells.",

Evo-devo, short for evolutionary developmental biology, is a relatively young discipline that sets out to retrace how gene and genome modifications have altered existing developmental mechanisms to produce novel forms. Evo-devo has been predominantly applied to the development of animals (19) (20) (21) and, to a lesser degree, of higher plants. (22, 23) However, an understanding of development of other multicellular organisms, such as the social amoebas or fungi will equally benefit from this approach. In the model organism D. discoideum, starving amoebas secrete cAMP pulses, which trigger chemotactic movement and aggregation of cells. Once aggregated, the amoebas differentiate into prestalk and prespore cells in a regulated ratio. The organizing tip continues to emit cAMP pulses, which shape the cell mass by coordinating cell movement. The cAMP pulses also cause the prestalk cells, which are chemotactically most responsive, to move towards the front. At the onset of culmination, the cells synthesize a cellulose tube, the apical prestalk cells move into the tube and mature into stalk cells, the remaining prestalk cells form support structures, such as the upper and lower cup and the basal disk. The prespore cells move up the stalk and mature into spores.",

A primary requisite for this project was the availability of a family tree that shows the relatedness of social amoeba species relative to the more ancestral solitary amoebazoans. We joined forces with the teams of Sandra Baldauf, an expert in protist molecular phylogeny, Thomas Winckler, who had already prepared an SSU rRNA tree of a subset of Dictyostelia species and two Dictyostelium field biologists, Jim Cavender and Hiromitso Hagiwara, to construct a molecular phylogeny of all known Dictyostelia. (24) We next mapped morphological traits of all species to the tree in order to determine the directionality of morphological evolution in the social amoebas. In parallel studies, the presence, regulation and function of genes that are essential for various aspects of cAMP signalling were investigated in social amoeba species that span the phylogeny. (25) This review presents a synthesis of the outcome of these studies with current insights in developmental signaling in the model species D. discoideum. It highlights major trends in the evolution of multicellular complexity in the social amoebas, and correlates these trends with elaboration of function of deeply conserved cAMP signalling genes.",

            "text": "Comparison of conserved DNA or protein sequences is a more direct and reliable method to establish genetic relationships. Two family trees of the social amoebas were constructed by comparing the DNA sequences of their small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene on one hand and the amino-acid sequences of their a-tubulin protein on the other. Both trees show that the similarities in fruiting body architecture only partially reflect an underlying genetic similarity. (24) Instead, both the a-tubulin tree and the SSU rRNA tree shown here (Fig. 3 ) subdivide the 75 known species of social amoebas into four major groups. There are dictyostelids in all four groups. The acytostelids and all white polysphondylids are members of group 2, but the purple polysphondylid P. violaceum occupies a position between groups 3 and 4, and forms a small clade with the dictyostelid D. laterosorum. This indicates that at least two out of the three previously proposed genera are polyphyletic. Multiple origins for the polyspondylids were also predicted by a family tree that was based on 18 combined morphological traits. (29) The DNA-based family tree was subsequently used to investigate trends in the evolution of morphology. The multicellular stages of different species of Dictyostelia show a large variety of shapes and sizes, which have been carefully quantitated and noted in the original species diagnoses, along with differences at the cellular level (see Refs 3, 30 for overviews). Species use different chemoattractants and aggregate as single cells or as inflowing streams (Fig. 4) . Once formed, aggregates may either produce one or several organizing tips, giving rise to solitary or clustered fruiting bodies. Secondary tips may appear in characteristic positions on rising sorogens, giving rise to secondary body axes and a range of different fruiting body architectures. Fruiting body stalks may develop a variety of support structures, such as discs, crampons or triangular supporters, while their tips can vary from thinly pointed to bulbous. Many species form motile slugs, which may optionally form a stalk while migrating. At the cellular level, spores can be round or oblong and, in the latter case, display conspicuous granules at their poles, which are either loosely grouped or consolidated. Some species have retained the ancestral survival strategy of encystation, or display the capacity to mate and form sexual macrocysts. A mapping of all these characters to the molecular tree indicates which characters are shared between close relatives, and yields information about the order in which characters evolved (Fig. 5) . Amoeba size shows no strong group-specific trend, but spores are consistently smaller in the most basal group 1. Of all traits, spore morphology follows the phylogeny most strongly. Spores of the evolutionary youngest group 4 species have no polar granules, in group 2, polar granules are loosely grouped, and in groups 1 and 3, they are consolidated. The acellular stalk evolved only once. The shape of the stalk tip also marks relatedness; species in group 2 usually have pointy or blunt tips, while in groups 1 and 4 stalk tips tend to be club-or head-shaped. Species with similarly coloured stalks and spore heads are often related, but no color is specific for any of the four major groups.",

Evolutionary younger species both have larger sized spores and larger sized fruiting bodies. The latter is particularly evident in group 4 where large stalk and sori size is correlated with a tendency to form solitary and unbranched fruiting bodies. In addition to large size, group 4 displays other distinguishing features, such as formation of cellular support structures, loss of individual encystation, loss of spore granules, and the use of cAMP as attractant. The correlation of the latter two traits was also noted earlier by Traub and Hohl. (31) These workers also associated the presence of polar granules with a tendency to form clustered and/or branched sorocarps and a tendency for those sorocarps to be smaller than in species without polar granules, both of which are borne out by the recent analysis.",

            "text": "cAMP plays a primary role; it is secreted in periodic waves by aggregation centres to mediate the aggregation of starving cells. (32) Later, organizing tips become the sources of cAMP waves (Fig. 1) , which direct the movement of cells in multicellular structures. (33) Secreted cAMP also triggers the differentiation of the prespore cells. (34, 35) In turn, the prespore cells secrete a chlorinated polyketide, DIF, that induces regulated redifferentiation of prespore cells into prestalk cells. (14) Ammonia, which is produced by protein degradation in the starving cells, represses terminal spore and stalk cell maturation during slug migration, (36, 37) and is implicated in cell sorting, slug phototaxis and fruiting body phototropism. (38, 39) Two secreted peptides, conditioned medium factor (CMF) and prestarvation factor (PSF) induce the growth to development transition. (40) Other peptides, the spore differentiation factors (SDFs), trigger the maturation of spores. (13) There is no information on the conservation of the peptide signals in other social amoeba species. Ammonia is always produced by starving amoebas, and at least some of its roles are therefore likely to be conserved. DIF was identified in another group 4 species, D. mucoroides, which also has the DIF-degrading enzyme, DIF dechlorinase. D. minutum and P. violaceum, which reside in group 3 and between groups 3 and 4, respectively, synthesize chlorinated factors that induce stalk cell differentiation in D. discoideum. However, they do not have DIF dechlorinase, indicating that the DIF signaling pathway is at best partially conserved. (41, 42) More information is available on the conservation of cAMP signalling. All tested group 4 species use cAMP to aggregate, but no species outside group 4. However, early biochemical work showed that species that use other attractants to aggregate, nevertheless display cAMP binding sites and cAMP phosphodiesterase on their cell surface after aggregation. (43, 44) The group 3 species, D. minutum, aggregates by continuous release of folic acid, but shows cAMP waves emerging from the tip region after aggregates have formed. (43, 45) This suggested that the role of the tip as a pacemaker of cAMP waves is deeply conserved in the social amoebas.",

(45, 46) Recent studies show that the cAR1 gene is deeply conserved in social amoeba evolution and is present in all four taxon groups. (25) The gene duplications that gave rise to cAR2, cAR3 and cAR4 only occurred in group 4 (Y. Kawabe and P. Schaap, unpublished results). The basal cAR1s are functionally identical to D. discoideum cAR1, but there is a marked difference in their developmental regulation. The cAR1s from the basal groups are expressed as a single mRNA after aggregation while, in group 4 species, a second cAR1 mRNA is expressed before and during aggregation. (25) Transcription of this early mRNA is driven by a second promoter that is more distal from the cAR1 coding sequence than the promoter that drives expression after aggregation. (47) Also in the gene encoding the extracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase, the promoter that drives late expression is proximal to the coding sequence and the promoters that drive expression before and during aggregation are more distal. (48) This arrangement suggests that the use of cAMP as chemoattractant by the evolutionary younger group 4 species was achieved by addition of distal promoters to existing cAMP signalling genes.",

Separate analyses were conducted on group 4 sequences with an additional 300 nucleotide positions that were more divergent. The tree is rooted on SSU rDNA sequences of closely related solitary amoebas.
