            "text": "The trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), a known translational inhibitor, induces ribosomal RNA (rRNA) cleavage. Here, we characterized this process relative to (1) specific 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage sites and (2) identity of specific upstream signaling elements in this pathway. Capillary electrophoresis indicated that DON at concentrations as low as 200 ng/ml evoked selective rRNA cleavage after 6 h and that 1000 ng/ml caused cleavage within 2 h. Northern blot analysis revealed that DON exposure induced six rRNA cleavage fragments from 28S rRNA and five fragments from 18S rRNA. When selective kinase inhibitors were used to identify potential upstream signals, RNAactivated protein kinase (PKR), hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), and p38 were found to be required for rRNA cleavage, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were not. Furthermore, rRNA fragmentation was suppressed by the p53 inhibitors pifithrin-a and pifithrin-m as well as the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Concurrent apoptosis was confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and flow cytometry. DON activated caspases 3, 8, and 9, thus suggesting the possible coinvolvement of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in rRNA cleavage. Satratoxin G (SG), anisomycin, and ricin also induced specific rRNA cleavage profiles identical to those of DON, suggesting that ribotoxins might share a conserved rRNA cleavage mechanism. Taken together, DON-induced rRNA cleavage is likely to be closely linked to apoptosis activation and appears to involve the sequential activation of PKR/Hck /p38/p53/caspase 8/ 9/caspase 3.",

PKR is a widely distributed constitutively expressed serine/threonine protein kinase that can be activated by dsRNA, interferon, proinflammatory stimuli, cytokines, and oxidative stress (Garcia et al., 2006; Williams, 2001) . PKR also activates p53, p38, JNK, Nuclear Factor-kappaB, signal transducer and activator of transcription, and interferon regulatory factor-1 (Williams, 1999) . Hck, a member of Src kinase family, is expressed specifically in myelomonocytic cell lineages and transduces extracellular signals that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Ernst et al., 2002; Tsygankov, 2003) . Upon DON exposure, both PKR and Hck are activated prior to the MAPKs and their respective inhibitors suppress downstream MAPK activation (Zhou et al., 2005b) . Although crosstalk between PKR and Hck is not clearly understood, PKR appears to be required for Hck interaction with the ribosome in the human monocyte U937 cell line (Bae et al., 2010) .",

Two fundamental questions arising from this work relate to the specificity and mechanisms for this cleavage. Using oligonucleotide extension, we identified one site of DON-induced rRNA cleavage is within the peptidyl transferase center of 28S rRNA; however, further identification of additional sites was precluded by the relatively poor resolution of conventional gel electrophoresis and limitations on this techniques imposed by RNA hairpin structures (Li and Pestka, 2008) . Regarding mechanisms, it is known that ricin and other ribosomeinactivating proteins (RIPs) cleave rRNA via a highly specific mechanism that involves N-glycosidase-mediated adenine depurination at highly conserved sarin/ricin (S/R) loop (Endo and Tsurugi, 1986; Hartley and Lord, 2004) . However, DON and other trichothecenes are low molecular weight chemicals and are devoid of inherent enzyme activities (Li and Pestka, 2008) . Induction of rRNA cleavage by chemicals or viruses has previously been suggested to be linked to apoptosis (Banerjee et al., 2000; Naito et al., 2009) raising the possibility that DONinduced rRNA cleavage might be similarly linked to this mechanism of cell death.",

Accordingly, both p53 and caspase activation are additional upstream elements in the signaling pathway leading to DON-induced rRNA cleavage.",

Cells were incubated with SG and anisomycin, which can freely diffuse through cell membrane and ricin, a RIP, which can enter the cells by endocytosis and retrograde translocation to ER and cytosol. Unlike SG and anisomycin that directly bind to ribosome to inhibit translation, ricin possesses inherent RNA N-glycosidase activity to depurinate RNA. Although these toxins have apparently different mechanisms for inhibiting translation, SG, anisomycin, and ricin induced a similar apoptosis-mediated cleavage profile to that of DON (Fig. 8) , suggesting that ribotoxins might share conserved pathway for mediating rRNA cleavage.

Particularly notable was RNase L, an enzyme that can mediate inhibition of protein synthesis, apoptosis induction, and antiviral activity (Stark et al., 1998) . Although RNase L is activated by a number of stressors, its only known endogenous direct activator is 2-5A, a product of oligoadenylate synthetase (Pandey et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2006) . Upon binding to 2-5A, RNase L is activated by dimerization and possibly inhibits protein synthesis via the degradation of both messenger RNA and 28S rRNA (Clemens and Vaquero, 1978; Wreschner et al., 1981) . We found that under cell-free conditions in the presence of 2-5A, RNase L readily cleaved both FRET probe and purified rRNA; however, it did not degrade rRNA in The observation that p38 but not JNK mediated DONinduced rRNA cleavage is consistent with previous observations that p38 is a central regulator of cell fate in DON-exposed macrophages (Zhou et al., 2005a) . Our findings further demonstrate that PKR and Hck also mediate DON-induced rRNA cleavage. Although crosstalk between PKR and Hck is still not completely understood, these kinases are wellestablished upstream mediators of DON-induced p38 activation (Zhou et al., 2003b (Zhou et al., , 2005b .

The data presented here do not support this hypothesis. First, PKR and Hck are activated by DON within minutes (Zhou et al., 2003b (Zhou et al., , 2005b , whereas DON-induced rRNA cleavage was detectable only after 2 h and required relatively higher DON concentrations. Second, suppression of DON-induced rRNA cleavage by PKR, Hck, and p38 inhibitors suggests that their activation is an upstream rather than downstream event. We therefore propose an alternative hypothesis in which entry of DON into the cell rapidly disrupts the conformation of rRNA yielding accessible intact hairpin loops at the surface of ribosome that would be capable of activating PKR or other double-stranded RNAbinding proteins. These events would initiate a stress response that would, especially at high toxin concentrations, ultimately drive rRNA cleavage in concert with apoptosis. This hypothesis is highly consistent with the growing recognition that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) initiate noninfectious innate immune and inflammatory responses (Newton and Dixit, 2012) . Bulavin et al. (1999) have previously shown that p38 mediates p53 phosphorylation. It was thus notable that rRNA cleavage was found here to be inhibited by pifithrin-a, a compound that reversibly inhibits both p53-dependent transactivation of p53-responsive genes and apoptosis, as well as by pifithrin-l, which blocks p53 interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins and selectively inhibits p53 translocation to mitochondria. Relatedly, we have previously demonstrated that DON induces translocation of BAX (a member of Bcl-2 family) to mitochondria and release of cytochrome c leading to apoptosis (Zhou et al., 2005a) . Finally, DON-induced rRNA cleavage was completely suppressed by the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, indicating that activation of caspases was a prerequisite of rRNA cleavage.",

It was remarkable that ricin, which possesses N-glycosidase enzymatic activity for 28S rRNA depurination, induced the identical rRNA cleavage profile to that of DON and two other low molecular weight translational inhibitors, SG and anisomycin. Possibly, in all four cases, toxin-mediated ribosome damage activated a canonical apoptosis-associated rRNA cleavage pathway. Future work should focus on understanding how DON mediates PKR activation, identifying critical executing caspases and RNases, ascertaining whether induction of rRNA cleavage by other ribotoxins or apoptosis-inducing agents is mediated by the same intracellular signaling pathways as well as validating these findings in animal models.",
