Th ese receptors trigger infl ammatory responses, activate innate immune responses, and prime adaptive immune responses to eradicate invading microbes [1] . TLR are members of a family of pattern-recognition receptors, which recognize molecular structures of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs), as well as endogenous structures and proteins released during infl ammation (damage/ danger-associated molecular patterns or DAMPs). To date, ten diff erent TLR have been identifi ed in humans and twelve in mice. TLR are expressed on all cells of the immune system, but also on parenchymal cells of many organs and tissues. Th e binding of a PAMP to a TLR results in cellular activation and initiates a variety of eff ector functions, including cytokine secretion, prolifera tion, co-stimulation or phagocyte maturation. To facilitate microbial recognition and to amplify cellular responses, certain TLR require additional proteins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), CD14, CD36 and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1). In this chapter, the role of CD14 as an accessory receptor for TLR in lung infl ammation and infection is discussed. Th e central role of CD14 in the recognition of various PAMPs and amplifi cation of immune and infl ammatory responses in the lung is depicted in Figure 1 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 320, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1525, "end": 1533, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "CD14 was characterized as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin (LPS) in 1990, almost a decade before the discovery and characterization of TLR, and can be regarded as the fi rst described pattern-recognition receptor [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 218, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Th e protein was fi rst identifi ed as a diff erentiation marker on the surface of monocytes and macrophages and was designated CD14 at the fi rst leukocyte typing workshop in Paris in 1982.

Moreover, the crystal structure of CD14 revealed that the protein has a `horseshoe' shape, similar to TLR4, and that LPS is bound within the pocket [4] . In contrast to TLR, however, CD14 lacks a transmembrane domain, and thus cannot initiate intracellular signal transduction by itself. Th e CD14 protein is processed in the endoplasmatic reticu lum and expressed as a 55 kDa glycoprotein on the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidyl (GPI) anchor [5] . Like other GPIanchored proteins, CD14 accumulates on the cell surface in microdomains known as lipid rafts, which are fairly rich in cholesterol and accumulate several kinases at the intracellular site.

Since interleukin (IL)-6 induces sCD14 expression in liver cells it is regarded as an acute phase protein. In bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fl uid from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sCD14 levels were strongly increased and correlated with total protein levels and neutrophil numbers in the BAL fl uid [6] , suggesting that sCD14 contributes to the infl ammatory process in the lung.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 119, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 725, "end": 728, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "CD14 is a molecule with a wide range of functions.

Ligation of CD14 by these ligands, except for apoptotic cells, mediates activation of infl ammatory responses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "LPS is the major constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is one of the most potent TLR ligands. CD14 together with LBP plays an essential role in binding of LPS to the TLR4/MD-2 complex [7] . LBP, which, among others, is present in the bloodstream and BAL fl uid [8] , binds to LPS aggregates and transfers LPS monomers to CD14. CD14 associates with TLR4/ MD-2 and transfers the LPS monomer to this complex [7] . Likewise, sCD14 is able to mediate LPS-activation of cells with low membrane CD14 expression, such as epithelial and endothelial cells [9] . However, at high con cen trations, LBP and sCD14 are also able to downregulate LPS-induced responses by transfer of LPS to lipoproteins for subsequent removal [10] . Recent data indicate that LPS is bound by MD-2 within the TLR4/ MD-2 complex [11] and that subsequent conformational changes in TLR4 lead to reorganization of its cytoplasmic domain, enabling the recruitment of the adaptor proteins, myeloid diff erentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing-adaptorprotein-inducing-inter feron (IFN)-\u03b2 (TRIF) [12] . Th ese adaptors initiate signal transduction to the nucleus by activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and IFN regulatory transcription factor (IRF)-3, leading to the production of cytokines that regulate infl ammatory cells [12] . In macrophages, TRIF-dependent signaling is essential for the expression of the majority of LPS-induced genes, including IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. CD14, which lacks an intracellular domain for signal transduction, is expressed on the surface of alveolar macrophages, infi ltrating monocytes and neutrophils, and at lower levels also on epithelial and endothelial cells in the lung. CD14 recognizes and binds various structures from invading microbes, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from mycobacteria, viral double stranded (ds) RNA and F glycoprotein (F-gp) from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). CD14 subsequently transfers these bound components to Toll-like receptors (TLR) which than trigger cell activation. Binding of LPS to CD14 is regulated by additional accessory receptors in the lung, including LPS-binding protein (LBP) and a number of surfactant proteins (SP). Furthermore, soluble CD14 (sCD14) enhances LPS-induced activation of cells with low CD14 expression. Depending on the microbe and the PAMPs it expresses, CD14-amplifi ed responses can either be benefi cial to the host by induction of an adequate infl ammatory and immune response to eradicate the invading microbe, or detrimental to the host by excessive infl ammation and/or dissemination of the pathogen. Recently, it was reported that, in the absence of CD14, the TLR4/MD-2 complex can distinguish between diff erent chemotypes of LPS [13] . Smooth LPS is synthesized by most Gram-negative bacteria and consists of three modules: Th e lipid A moiety, a core poly saccharide, and an O-polysaccharide of variable length (made up of 1 to over 50 monosaccharide units) [7] . Gram-negative bacteria that fail to add the core polysaccharide or the O-polysaccharide chain to the lipid A moiety produce `rough' LPS, named after the rough morphology of the colonies these bacteria form. Lipid A, the bioactive part of both smooth and rough LPS, is responsible for most of the pathogenic eff ects in Gram-negative bacterial infections [7, 12] . Murine macrophages lacking CD14 secreted equal amounts of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) to macrophages expressing CD14 upon stimulation with rough LPS, but failed to secrete TNF in response to smooth LPS, an eff ect which was reversed by addition of sCD14 [13] . Moreover, macrophages lacking CD14 failed to secrete IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to either rough or smooth LPS. Th ese fi ndings indicate that CD14 is required for activation of the TLR4/TRIF pathway by either smooth or rough LPS, and required for the activation of TLR4/ MyD88 pathway by smooth but not by rough LPS [13] . In addition to LPS, CD14 also facilitates TLR4 activation by other PAMPs including certain viral components [13, 14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 210, "end": 213, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 287, "end": 290, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 431, "end": 434, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 572, "end": 575, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 737, "end": 741, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 821, "end": 825, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1119, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1348, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2859, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3085, "end": 3088, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3445, "end": 3448, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3449, "end": 3452, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3711, "end": 3715, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4027, "end": 4031, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4142, "end": 4146, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4147, "end": 4150, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CD14 and the LPS receptor complex"}, {"text": "In the lung, binding of LPS to TLR4 is infl uenced by a number of surfactant proteins (SP), including SP-A, SP-C and SP-D [15] .

Nontypeable H. infl uenzae expresses the TLR4 ligands LPS and lipooligosaccharide on its cell wall, as well as several TLR2 ligands, including lipoproteins and porins. Previously, we found that activa tion of alveolar macrophages by nontypeable H. infl uenzae depended on expression of TLR4, TLR2, and CD14 [30] .

Interestingly, despite impaired bacterial clearance in CD14-defi cient and TLR4-defi cient mice, the infl ammatory response in the lung was strongly reduced in TLR4 defi cient mice, but elevated in CD14 defi cient mice. Similar observations were made with encapsulated H. infl uenzae in TLR4-mutant mice [31] . Furthermore, clearance of nontypeable H. infl uenzae was also significantly impaired in MyD88-defi cient mice, but not in mice lacking functional TRIF [30] .

Although the role of TLR4 (and TLR2) in phagocytic killing is controversial, it is unknown whether CD14 is involved in such processes. Th e role of CD14 in E. coli-induced pneumonia was determined in anti-CD14 antibody treated rabbits. Intravenous anti-CD14 antibody treatment of rabbits inoculated with E. coli by bronchial instillation, resulted in decreased bacterial clearance from the lungs, but had no eff ect on neutrophil infi ltration or cytokine release in the lungs [32] . However, anti-CD14 treatment protected against sustained hypotension and reduced the levels of nitrate and nitrite in the blood. Th e contribution of CD14 to E. coli-induced pneumonia has not been investigated in mice, whereas the role of the other components of the LPS receptor complex (TLR4, MD-2, MyD88, TRIF) has been determined using gene-defi cient or mutant mice.
