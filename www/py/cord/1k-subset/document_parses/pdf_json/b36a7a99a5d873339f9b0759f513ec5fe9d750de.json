Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda. Results: Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C-like virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs.

The intensity of contact between wildlife, livestock and human population is increasing due to a number of factors, primarily human and livestock population growth leading to encroachment onto wildlife habitat [1, 2] . During recent decades a number of pathogen crossovers from wildlife to humans and livestock have occurred resulting in emerging diseases, such as SARS, Hantavirus Pulmonary syndrome 1, Nipah virus disease 1, and Hendra virus-induced diseases among others. However, it is also evident that transmission can occur both ways i.e. pathogens may spill-over to wildlife from humans and/or from livestock. One example of this is the spill-over of Canine distemper virus from domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) to African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Serengeti in 1991 leading to local extinction of wild dogs in the area [2] . Apart from being carriers of novel viruses with the potential to cause disease in na\u00efve domestic hosts, wildlife may also act as reservoirs for known viral pathogensfor example there are a number of wildlife reservoirs for foot and mouth disease virus such as African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) [3] .

Viral metagenomics is a sequence, and culture-independent approach that has proven to be a valuable tool for the investigation not only of diseases of unknown etiology but also of the complete viral flora of different reservoirs and vectors.

Porcine parvovirus 4 was originally discovered in 2010 in samples collected from pigs in North Carolina in 2005 after an outbreak of acute-onset of disease with high mortality [12] . Subsequently, PPV4 was reported in pigs in China where 1.84% of the investigated pigs were PPV4 positive [13] . The genome of parvoviruses consists of two major open reading frames (ORF) encoding the non-structural and the capsid proteins. However, the genomes of PPV4 as well as of PBoV contain an additional third ORF [12] . The parvovirus sequences obtained from this study could be found in the capsid and in the non-structural ORF. All reads classified as parvovirus gave significant similarity to PPV4 through Blastx searches. A PCR with primers designed to amplify PPV4-like sequences from the original extracted genetic material showed the presence of this virus in one of the three bushpig sera. Sequencing of the PCR product (GenBank accession number: JQ277337) confirmed correct amplification and sequence analysis showed that at protein level (84 amino acids), the product displayed a 75.9-77.1% sequence similarity to the PPV4 sequences available in GenBank. In addition, the phylogenetic tree generated from these data ( Figure 1 ) grouped the sequence with PPV4 when analysed together with sequences from all the different parvovirus genera (Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Dependovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus) and PPV4. However, the tree also confirms the divergence of the bushpig PPV4 from the other PPV4. PPV4 has previously been reported in domestic pigs only in USA and China [12, 13] .
