We call this the L11 'P-site loop'. Chemical protection of wild-type ribosome shows that that the P-site loop is inherently flexible, i.e. it is extended into the ribosomal P-site when this is unoccupied by tRNA, while it is retracted into the terminal loop of 25S rRNA Helix 84 when the P-site is occupied. To further analyze the function of this structure, a series of mutants within the P-site loop were created and analyzed. A mutant that favors interaction of the P-site loop with the terminal loop of Helix 84 promoted increased affinity for peptidyl-tRNA, while another that favors its extension into the ribosomal P-site had the opposite effect. The two mutants also had opposing effects on binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and downstream functional effects were observed on translational fidelity, drug resistance/hypersensitivity, virus maintenance and overall cell growth. These analyses suggest that the L11 P-site loop normally helps to optimize ribosome function by monitoring the occupancy status of the ribosomal P-site.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Over the past decade, atomic resolution ribosome structures have revealed the locations of critical elements. However, these static images do not reveal the dynamic movements within this complex macromolecule. The ribosome must coordinate multiple activities between spatially and functionally different sites in two subunits.

Events occurring in these regions must be carefully coordinated to assure rapid and accurate decoding of messenger RNAs (mRNAs).

The high degree of similarity across species, from the primary amino acid sequences to their tertiary structures, suggests conserved functional roles beyond serving as mere scaffolding for the rRNAs. Ribosomal protein L11 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential, highly conserved component of the 60S subunit (in bacteria and archaea, the homologous protein is named L5; the yeast nomenclature is used throughout this text to minimize confusion). At the primary amino acid sequence level, L11 is well conserved among eukaryotes ($67-97% identity), while bacterial and archaeal L5 proteins are less well conserved (27-55% identical) (Supplementary Figure S1A ). L11 is uniquely positioned at the interface between the large subunit central protuberance ( Figure 1A and 1B) and the head of the small subunit ( Figure 1A ) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . In the small subunit, the head region undergoes significant rotational movement relative to the central protuberance between the pre-and post-translocational states (6) , and the protein-protein interactions between L11 and S18 (S13 in bacteria and archaea) on the small subunit (the B1b and B1c intersubunit bridges) undergo the largest intersubunit structural rearrangements between these two states (7) (8) (9) . These observations suggest that L11 may play a central role as an informational conduit between the two subunits. Detailed analysis of X-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM structures ( Figure 1B ) reveals that the concave surface of the b-sheet portion of L11 interacts with specific nucleotides in the minor groove of 23S rRNA helix 84 (10) . L11 also makes contacts with the helix III and loop C regions of 5S rRNA; these connections have been hypothesized to help stabilize 5S rRNA interactions and may participate in an information signal transmission network linking functional centers within the ribosome (1, 11) . Importantly, the B1b and B1c intersubunit bridges with S18 are the only protein-protein interactions between the two subunits (2, 3, 5, 8) . Analyses of these structures indicate that contacts involving L11 and S18 through the B1b and B1c bridges break and rearrange after eEF-2 binding and ribosome ratcheting, controlled in part by differentially charged amino acid side chains between the two proteins (2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12) . An internal loop of L11 that we denote the 'L11 P-site loop', which is roughly formed by amino acid residues 48-68, also directly contacts the T-loop of the peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site through tRNA nucleotide 56 (3) (4) (5) . At the level of primary amino acid sequence, the P-site loop is highly conserved among eukaryotes (85-100% identity), while it is less well conserved among bacteria and archaea (42-57% identity) (Supplementary Figure S1B) . At the biochemical level, however, the P-site loop is significantly more homogeneous, containing a large number of well-aligned charged and aromatic amino acids. In particular, A50, F57, R60 and I65 (yeast numbering) are universally conserved. An alignment of the P-site loop structures from yeast, Haloarcula marismortui, Thermus thermophilus and Escherichia coli reveals that the P-site loop is extremely well conserved at the structural level (Supplementary Figure S1C) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 891, "end": 894, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 895, "end": 898, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 899, "end": 902, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 903, "end": 906, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1077, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1314, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1318, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1322, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1664, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1937, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1938, "end": 1941, "text": "11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2073, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2074, "end": 2076, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2077, "end": 2079, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2082, "text": "8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2352, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2353, "end": 2355, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2358, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2361, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2362, "end": 2364, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2365, "end": 2368, "text": "12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2583, "end": 2586, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2587, "end": 2590, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2591, "end": 2594, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 714, "end": 724, "text": "Figure S1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 821, "end": 830, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 875, "end": 884, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1517, "text": "Figure 1B", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2807, "end": 2818, "text": "Figure S1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3282, "end": 3293, "text": "Figure S1C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In yeast, L11 is encoded by the paralogous genes RPL11A and RPL11B located on chromosomes 16 and 7, respectively (13) .

L16) showed that expression of either isoform was sufficient for cell viability (14) . However, when expressed as the sole form of L11, RPL11A mRNA transcripts accumulated to only 33-40% of wild-type levels as compared to cells expressing both isogenes, while RPL11B mRNAs accumulated to 60-66%. Expression of either isogene alone also affected 60S subunit assembly: a strain expressing only L11B grew at wild-type rates but synthesized fewer 60S subunits than wild-type cells (although apparently not below a threshold necessary for wild-type growth rates), while strains expressing only L11A grew more slowly than wild-type, and synthesized only 33-40% of wild-type levels of total L11 and 60S subunits (14) . A random mutagenesis screen of RPL11B for cold-sensitive mutants identified alleles that promoted 25S pre-rRNA processing and initiation defects (15) . The specific mutants identified in that study were S34P, S41P, S97F, A98V, S119C and G135D. In Arabidopsis, divergent 5 0 untranslated regions (UTRs) between the two isogenes were found to result in differential expression among plant tissues (16) . In addition to its function as a ribosomal protein, L11 has been implicated in p53 activation through its interactions with HDM2 in the nucleus of human fibroblast cells (17) , and mutant forms of L11 have been linked to Daimond-Blackfan anemia in humans (18) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 117, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 399, "end": 403, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1028, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1180, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1430, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1607, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1692, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Although the structural information suggests that L11 should play a significant role in translation, functional analyses of the protein in this role have not been performed.

Detailed biochemical and structural analyses focused on two multi-amino acid mutants with opposing effects on rRNA structure and tRNA binding. We propose that prior to peptidyltransfer, the presence of peptidyl-tRNA in the large subunit P-site positions the L11 P-site loop to interact with the Helix 84 of the large subunit rRNA. After peptidyltransfer, spontaneous translocation of the deacylated tRNA to the large subunit E-site allows the L11 P-site loop to extend into the P-site, breaking contact with Helix 84.

Significant changes in +1 PRF were also observed in the Y52A, Y52S, Y52N, Y52E, Y52H and Y52F mutants. mRNA decoding occurs in the small subunit decoding center, and changes in termination codon recognition (nonsense suppression) is another indicator of altered translational fidelity. pYDL-UAA (39) , which contains an in-frame termination codon immediately 5 0 of the firefly luciferase gene, was used to monitor this parameter.

In all strains the 60S peak was smaller than that of the 40S fraction which can be attributed to the presence of only a single copy of RPL11B, which has previously been shown to effectively reduce the number of 60S subunits produced by the cell to 60-66% of true wild-type levels while having no visible phenotypic effect on growth (14) . No significant differences were observed among the samples (data not shown). Phenotypic variation in PRF and in the presence of anisomycin and sparsomycin are indicative of altered interactions between the ribosome and tRNAs. P-site tRNA K d values were determined in vitro by binding 2-fold serial dilutions of N-acetylated-[ 14 C]Phe-tRNA to ribosomes until saturation was achieved ( Figure 4A ), and the resulting data were used to determine steady-state single site binding K d values ( Figure 4B ). Wild-type ribosomes bound this P-site substrate with a K d of 72.3 \u00b1 7.9 nM. The 51-4A mutants promoted a slight increase in affinity for P-site substrate (K d = 50.9 \u00b1 11.2 nM), while 54-7A had the opposite effect (K d = 89.3 \u00b1 10.4 nM). Given the physical interaction between the L11 P-site loop and peptidyl-tRNA, it was imperative to determine whether the observed small changes in P-site affinities promoted by the mutants were biochemically significant. To this end, multiple turnover puromycin reactions were performed. In these experiments, puromycin was added to ribosomes pre-incubated with excess P-site substrate, i.e. Ac-[ 14 C]Phe-tRNA Phe , and accumulation of the peptidylpuromycin product was monitored over time. In these reactions, the first round of peptidylpuromycin synthesis is very rapid. Next, in a slow step, the ribosome intrinsically translocates the deacylated tRNA Phe into the E-site (40), followed by the slow diffusion of Ac-[ 14 C]Phe-tRNA Phe into the P-site where it can react with puromycin. Repetition of this cycle results in slow multiple rounds of product synthesis ( Figure 4C ). Assuming that the L11 mutants do not affect either rates of intrinsic translocation or of Ac-[ 14 C]Phe-tRNA Phe diffusion into the P-site, changes in product accumulation, i.e. K obs , should be due to differences in binding affinities for the P-site substrate. Consistent with this model 51-4A promoted 1.46 \u00b1 0.14-fold increased K obs relative to wild-type ribosomes, while 54-7A decreased K obs to Figure 3 . The L11B mutants promote defects in translational fidelity. Isogenic yeast cells expressing either wild-type or mutant forms of L11B were transformed with dual luciferase reporters and control plasmids and rates of translational recoding were determined.

Specifically, as compared to wild-type ribosomes, 51-4A promoted enhanced protection of this loop, while the loop was deprotected in the 54-7A mutants.

These findings suggested that the two mutants had the effects of displacing the P-site loop into two opposing conformational states: extended toward the P-site (54-57A), or retracted into H84 (51-54A). To test whether these two states are naturally dependent on P-site occupancy, the experiments were repeated with wild-type and mutant ribosomes with or without tRNA Phe in their P-sites.

Interestingly, C2675 showed significant deprotection when the P-site was occupied by tRNA. This base is on the far side of the terminal end of H84 from the P-site loop, suggesting that H84 itself alters its conformation upon tRNA occupancy of the P-site ( Figure 5C ). 51-4A's H84 bases were unchanged between P-site bound and unbound ribosomes, consistent with the P-site loop positioned in the 'retracted' state in this mutant, although small differences in the protection patterns suggest that the P-site loop is in a slightly different orientation in this mutant.

Upon occupation of the P-site, the peptidyl-tRNA T-loop displaces the L11 P-site loop, causing its retraction into H84. By this model, the rRNA SHAPE analyses depicting increased protection of Helix 84 by the 51-4A mutant show that this mutant drives the L11 P-site loop equilibrium toward the 'retracted' state. Conversely, increased deprotection of Helix 84 in the 54-7A mutant suggests that this more mimics the P-site unoccupied state, i.e. the 'extended' P-site loop state. This analysis directly explains the P-site binding data. Retraction of the P-site loop from the P-site results in 51-4A ribosomes having higher intrinsic affinity for this substrate while extension of this structure into the P-site creates a steric clash with the peptidyl-tRNA T-loop, resulting in decreased affinity for this substrate. That neither mutant conferred optimal peptidyl-tRNA P-site occupancy may account for their hypersensitivity to sparsomycin, especially for 54-7A in which the P-site loop is already competing with the tRNA for the P-site.

In the aa-tRNA binding reactions, the ribosomal P-sites were occupied with daeacylated tRNA. We suggest that in the 51-4A mutant, the P-site ligand is more 'locked' into a suboptimal conformation, which in turn feeds back to the A-site, resulting in decreased affinity for its ligand.

Anisomycin resistance by both mutants also followed the reciprocal P-site/A-site pattern, i.e. both mutants were sparsomycin hypersensitive. Paromomycin interacts with the decoding center in the small subunit, where it promotes misreading of near-cognate codons in the A-site by stabilizing codon-anticodon interactions (45) . This sensitivity may be attributable to an observed increase in missense incorporation of a near cognate arginine (AGA) over that of the sense serine codon (AGC) in mutant 51-4A. Intriguingly, 54-7A had wild-type levels of missense incorporation suggesting that its sensitivity to paromomycin was indirect.

The failure to observe decreased +1 PRF in the 51-54A mutant, despite its increased affinity for peptidyl-tRNA, is not entirely clear, although this may be due to the inability of these ribosomes to achieve a threshold beyond which +1 PRF effects can be observed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 871, "end": 875, "text": "(19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 876, "end": 879, "text": "48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The changes in rRNA stability observed in the terminal loop of Helix 88 and in ES31 are intriguing.

(Left) When the large subunit P-site is unoccupied by tRNA, the L11 P-site loop is able to extend into this space leaving the distal loop of H84 partially deprotected from chemical attack. This conformation is favored by the 54-7A mutant of L11B. (Right panel) Occupation of the P-site by peptidyl-tRNA displaces the L11 P-site loop, causing it to tightly retract from the P-site and interact with H84, resulting in increased protection of the H84 terminal loop from chemical attack. H84 likely moves toward the P-site loop slightly, increasing the exposure of C2675 to the surrounding solvent.

The observation that mutations located in three very different and topologically distinct regions of the large subunit conferred similar structural effects suggest that this kissing loop interaction plays an important role in ribosome function. Its location on the cytoplasmic face of the ribosome where deacylated tRNA leaves the molecule implies that the interaction between the terminal loops of Helices 88 and 22 may be involved in gating this deacylated tRNA exit corridor open and closed. This is consistent with the model of allosteric coordination between the A-and E-sites (52, 53) , which would indicate that the defects conferred by all of these mutants on aa-tRNA binding might impair this E-site gating function. The decreased lability of C2531 and G2534 in ES31 is similarly intriguing, raising more questions than answers. No function is currently associated with this expansion segment, but recent cryo-EM analysis shows it to be located on a solvent accessible surface of the large subunit (4) .
