Only six percent of PIAH were admitted to an ICU; which is about three times lower than reported from Argentina, Canada and USA (17-19%) [9] [10] [11] but similar to 8% found in a UK hospital [12] and identical to 6% of ICU admissions reported from a large hospital in Hamburg (Northern Germany) [8] . In Germany, both in our study and in Hamburg, a clearly lower percentage of patients with PIA received treatment with oseltamivir (25% and 28%, respectively) and antibiotics (30% and 25%, respectively) [8] , when compared to antiviral (46-99%) [9] [10] [11] and antibiotic (74-86%) treatment in other PIAH studies [9] [10] [11] .

Mechanical ventilation was required six times more often (17%) than documented in our study (3%), whereas data from USA and Canada revealed a similar frequency (6%) for hospitalized patients [9, 10] . The low rates of severe influenza cases in the present study correspond with the results of an earlier study on severe seasonal influenza in Germany [13] . Hence, on the one hand, the higher primary and secondary complication rates among hospitalized patients in other countries may reflect a real increase in the complication rate, due to delayed treatment with a limited access to primary health care.
