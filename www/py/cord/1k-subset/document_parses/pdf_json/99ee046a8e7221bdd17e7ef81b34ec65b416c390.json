One group is lectins. Ipomoelin (IPO) is one of the wound-inducible proteins of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas cv. Tainung 57) and is a Jacalinrelated lectin (JRL). In this study, we resolved the crystal structures of IPO in its apo form and in complex with carbohydrates such as methyl a-D-mannopyranoside (Me-Man), methyl a-D-glucopyranoside (Me-Glc), and methyl a-D-galactopyranoside (Me-Gal) in different space groups. The packing diagrams indicated that IPO might represent a compact tetrameric association in the JRL family. The protomer of IPO showed a canonical b-prism fold with 12 strands of b-sheets but with 2 additional short b-strands at the N terminus. A truncated IPO (DN10IPO) by removing the 2 short b-strands of the N terminus was used to reveal its role in a tetrameric association. Gel filtration chromatography confirmed IPO as a tetrameric form in solution. Isothermal titration calorimetry determined the binding constants (K A ) of IPO and DN10IPO against various carbohydrates. IPO could bind to Me-Man, Me-Glc, and Me-Gal with similar binding constants. In contrast, DN10IPO showed high binding ability to Me-Man and Me-Glc but could not bind to Me-Gal. Our structural and functional analysis of IPO revealed that its compact tetrameric association and carbohydrate binding polyspecificity could be regulated by the 2 additional N-terminal b-strands.

Plant lectins are involved in the plant defense mechanism because of carbohydrate binding properties [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The toxicity of lectins was also confirmed in animal experiments [10, 11] . Plant lectins show resistance to digestive enzymes and can bind selectively to the carbohydrate moieties of gut epithelial cells to interfere in nutrient digestion and absorption [12] , so they could be a natural insecticide. In addition, plant lectins have been used for blood typing and immunological assay. The lectin concanavalin A is commercially used in affinity chromatography for purifying glycoproteins.

The results show no differences with or without the methyl group of monosaccharides for binding properties in Artocarpin and Banlec possibly because of no aromatic side chain of residues in Artocarpin and Banlec like the residue Trp142 in IPO ( Figure 7A and 7B) . Interestingly, IPO shared similar binding properties to Jacalin for its Tyr122, which [37] . To examine the binding mode of Me-Man for Artocarpin, Banlec, Jacalin, and IPO, the binding position of Me-Man with IPO showed a distant binding site as compared with that for Artocarpin, Banlec, and Jacalin ( Figure 7D ). DN10IPO could be recovered as the mannose/glucose specific lectin if DN10IPO represented the monomeric IPO and wild-type IPO represented the tetrameric IPO. The monomeric IPO showed 5 times and 6 times binding affinity to Me-Man and Me-Glc, respectively, as compared with those of tetrameric IPO. Therefore, the N terminus of IPO is involved in the carbohydrate recognition, which results in the carbohydrate binding polyspecificity of tetrameric IPO. From the tetrameric IPO structure, the residue Leu5 and His8 in the N terminus of monomer B (chain B) forms 3 hydrogen bonds with the residue Asn19 in the loop between b3 and b4 of monomer A (chain A) (Figure 8 ). The hydrogen bonds might pull out the loop of b3-b4 and form a larger binding cavity for different carbohydrates in monomer A. However, in DN10IPO, the hydrogen bonds would disappear and might relocate the b3-b4 loop to cause a smaller binding cavity.
