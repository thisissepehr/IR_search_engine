Few complete genome sequences of influenza A viruses from Europe are publicly available at the present time and there have been few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza A viruses. We have studied the evolution of circulating human H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006, we analysed 234 Danish human influenza A viruses and characterised 24 complete genomes.",

            "text": "Every year the influenza A virus causes human infection with varying severity depending on the host acquired immunity against the particular virus strain. Three to five million people experience severe illness and 0.25 to 0.5 million people die of influenza yearly worldwide (WHO EB111/10). The influenza virus evades host immunity by accumulation of point mutations (drift) in the major surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) or by reassortment of segments from different viruses co-infecting the same cell leading to a new stain with a HA (and NA) not seen in the population before (shift). In the worst case, shifts may cause pandemics. There have been three pandemics the last hundred years, the Spanish flu in 1918 (H1N1), the Asian flu in 1957 (H2N2) and the Hong Kong flu in 1968 (H3N2). It is believed that new pandemics emerge through shifts with strains from the avian reservoir, as was the case of the pandemics of 1957 and 1968, or by direct introduction of an avian strain into the human population as suggested for the 1918 pandemic [1] . At present only two of the 16 possible HA subtypes (H1 and H3), and two of the nine possible NA subtypes (N1 and N2) are circulating in man. H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A viruses have co-circulated in the human population since the re-emergence of H1N1 in 1977, increasing the possibility for genetic reassortments. The prevalence of the different subtype combinations may vary from season to season. The H3N2 has been the predominant influenza A strain during the last 20 years, with the exception of the 1988-1989 and 2000-2001 seasons where H1N1 infections dominated [2] . In the 2000-2001 season a new reassorted human strain, H1N2, emerged in Europe and became established in the autumn 2001 [3, 4] . The new H1N2 subtype was covered by the 2002-2003 H1 and N2 trivalent vaccine components and because both H1 and N2 viruses had circulated the previous years some degree of herd immunity against the new strain was expected. The H1N2 viruses were not associated with severe influenza illness that season. In 2002, a new lineage A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like emerged in Asia and caused significant outbreaks on every continent [5, 6] .",

In N1 the upper case letter ' P ' stands for phylogenetically important region (PIR) and the following letters indicate the actual PIR. Based on the ratio of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions none of the influenza A genes were directly influenced by positive selection (dN/dS<1) (Table  3) . However, as expected the HA1 region of both H3 and H1 viruses were more influenced by evolutionary pressure (Table 3) . We applied FEL and SLAC maximum-likelihood methods to estimate individual positively selected sites in H3N2 HA and NA and added REL for smaller datasets in all genes (se methods section). The FEL method found one site in the H3 protein (n = 204), position 199 (p = 0.046) to be positively selected, while the more conservative SLAC analysis found none. No positive selected sites were predicted for the N2 genes (n = 166) and none in the internal genes (n = 15) estimated by FEL and SLAC. The REL analysis retrieved four sites in the M1 gene to be selected namely positions 208, 211, 218 and 219. No sites in HA (n = 27) and NA (n = 30) of the H1N1 viruses were directly positively selected with any of the three methods of analysis.

The introduction of the A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2) strains in 2002-2003 caused a \"jump\" in the evolution of both HA and NA genes. Many of the substitutions in HA introduced with the A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses have become fixed, probably reflecting a very fit virus. The genetic variation before the 2003-2004 season may have been more influenced by introduction of new viruses through viral migration than adaptive evolution of the genes. A constant rate of drift was not observed for HA but instead periods of change followed by stasis periods. The low dN/dS ratios (0.232 for HA and 0.247 for NA) also indicated that the influenza genes were not directly influenced by positive selection. Reassortments between co-circulating strains and viruses from previous seasons, and introduction of viruses from other parts of the world might play a larger role than natural selection for some seasons, as also observed by others [27, 28] . [2, 4, 25, 26] . The reassorted H1N2 viruses possessed only the HA from A/New Caldonia/20/ 99(H1N1)-like viruses and the rest of the genome from A/ Moscow/10/99(H3N2)-like viruses as also reported by others using partial sequences [25] . The H1N2 viruses have been introduced to Denmark from elsewhere and are not a local reassortant.

The HA substitution D144N was however not responsible for the antigenic drift of the Fujian-like viruses. It has been shown that only two amino acid changes, H155T and Q156H, specified the antigenic difference from Moscow-like to Fujian-like [37] , both are located at antigenic site B. The T155 and H156 amino acids have been maintained in all Danish isolates after the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses. With the A/California/7/04(H3N2)-like viruses in 2004-2005, site 145 has changed from K to S in some isolates and to N in others. S145 has been found at this position before 1999 and N145K was the only cluster-difference substitution between isolates from the seasons 1987/ 1989 and 1992/1995 [38] . It was therefore suggested that substitutions at this site alone could have large antigenic effect. Antigenic site A, located in a loop, makes few contacts with the rest of the structure, therefore 144 and 145 may change drastically without influencing on the overall shape of the HA molecule.",

One region in HA, position 225 to 227, that influence antigenic site D, has changed drastically during the study period from GVS \u2192 DVS \u2192 DIP \u2192 NIP. The influence of antigenic site D was first apparent in the antigenic change from Fujian-like viruses to California-like viruses; however, the antigenic site B was still the preferred site for antigenic change.

The reason for this higher degree of conservation is that 80% of the antibody epitopes are located in the variable glycoproteins HA and NA, while only 40% of the T-cell epitopes are found in these proteins [48] . Recent research has shown some degree of escape from CTL-mediated immunity in addition to escape from neutralizing antibodies [28] . In our dataset we found several substitutions in regions involved in protective T-cell response [48] in NA, PA, M1, NS1 and most in the NP protein. This is not unexpected because most T-cell epitopes are defined for the NP protein and this protein is the main target for the cytotoxic host immune response [49, 50] . The extensive variations in the T-cell epitopes during 1999 to 2006 suggest that these regions and the antibody epitopes are working together for efficient escape from the host defence responses.",

Substitutions at antigenic site B and the predicted N-glycosylation at position 144 in HA antigenic site A together with a stronger NA might have contributed to the increased infectivity of the reassorted Fujian-like viruses of the 2003-2004 season, causing an epidemic in Denmark. We have shown that the preferred antibody epitope for genetic change is antigenic site B for the Danish dataset also reflecting that site A is camouflaged by glycosylation.

Greater density of carbohydrate in the stalk region of NA might reflect a need for proteolytic protection.

The M2 protein is a membrane ion channel protein on the surface of the virus molecule, a higher dN/dS ratio for this protein compared to the internal proteins is expected.

In our H3 dataset (n = 204) site 199 was influenced by positive selection as calculated by FEL analysis, but no positively selected sites were found applying the more conservative SLAC method. Position 199 may be involved in receptor binding and influence on the virus ability to grow in eggs [10] . In a similar study on a slightly larger dataset (n = 284) positions 220 and 229 were found to be positively selected [11] . Another study found positions 13 and 236 [62] ; however, suggested positively selected sites may vary by the dataset applied, method used and the significance level selected for a site to be classified as positively selected. REL analysis identified four sites (208, 211, 218 and 219) in M1 under positive selection pressure. REL analysis tends to give better estimates on small datasets than SLAC and FEL. Sites 211, 218, and 219 were still selected when the bayes factor cut-off was increased from 50 to 200. Further analysis would be needed to determine if these sites actually are positively selected.",

Sites with dN>dS with a <0.05 significance level for likelihood ratio test (LRT) were implied as positively selected for the large HA and NA datasets. For the small datasets (genes coding for the internal proteins <15 and the H1N1 viruses <30) we additionally ran a random effects likelihood (REL) analysis using an empirical Bayes approach with NJ phylogenetic trees in Datamonkey [70] . This method is expected to calculate positively selected sites more accurately in small datasets. The accepted significance level for a positively selected site was set at <0.1 (two-tailed binominal distribution) for SLAC and FEL analyses and >50 bayes factor for REL.",

The P epitope value was calculated as the number of mutations within an antibody antigenic site divided by the number of amino acids defining the site. It is assumed that an antigenic epitope which has the greatest percentage of mutations is dominant, because that epitope is influenced by the greatest selective pressure from the immune system. The P epitope distance is defined as the fractional change between the dominant antigenic epitopes of one strain compared to another. The P epitope Calculator [76, 77] was applied for H3 sequences. Residues in antigenic epitopes were collected from several references [9, 13, 39, 40, 48, [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] 83, 84] .",

The next season, 2002-2003, was characterised by co-circulating lineages. These were of viruses most closely related to A/New York/55/01(H3N2) from the previous season, H1N2 viruses (described in more detail below) and a new H3 lineage, the A/Fujian/ 411/02(H3N2)-like viruses. The introduction of the A/ Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses caused a \"jump\" in the evolution of the H3N2 viruses (Figure 2). The HAs in subsequent seasons have evolved from these viruses. In 2003-2004 the HAs form a subclade to the A/Fujian/ 411/02(H3N2)-like lineage from 2002-2003. These viruses were reassortants probably acquiring the rest of the genome from the 2001-2002 or 2002-2003 A/New York/ 55/01(H3N2)-like viruses (Figure 2, 3 and 4) and became the predominant lineage co-circulating with the A/Wellington/1/04(H3N2)-like viruses introduced from the southern hemisphere. One single H1N2 virus isolate was also observed this season. The A/Wellington/1/ 04(H3N2)-like lineage, the following season (2004/ 2005), had drifted into a more A/California/7/04(H3N2)like lineage, causing a revision of the vaccine composition from A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2) to A/California/7/ 04(H3N2) [9]. In 2005-2006 the 2004-2005 A/California/7/04(H3N2)-like lineages continued to circulate together with the slightly different A/Wisconsin/67/ 05(H3N2)-like viruses (Figure 2). As a result the H3N2 vaccine component for the northern hemisphere 2006-2007 was changed to A/Wisconsin/67/05(H3N2) [9]. The A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2), A/Wellington/1/04(H3N2) and A/California/7/04(H3N2)-like viruses all share the same type of NS segments and there are few variations between the Wellington, California and Wisconsin-like strains, especially in the internal genes (Figure 3 and 4). However, the internal genes of the A/Wisconsin/67/ 05(H3N2)-like viruses, especially the polymerase acidic (PA), nucleoprotein (NP) and M are more closely related to the A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses from 2002-2003 than the A/California/7/04(H3N2) from the previous season(Figure 3 and 4).",

The A/New York/55/01(H3N2)-like viruses from the 2001-2002 season had lost the position 38 sequon but possessed the potential glycosylation site at position 126. The position 38 sequon was observed after 1999-2000, but the predicted score has been below the set threshold value of 0.5 and therefore not included in the count further (Figure 5). In 2002-03 two out of four A/New York/55/01(H3N2)-like viruses possessed ten potential glycosylation sites. Compared to the A/New York/55/01(H3N2)-like viruses from the season before, they gained a glycosylation at position 144. The A/Fujian/ 411/02(H3N2)-like viruses from the 2002-2003 season possessed nine potential glycosylations, they kept the newly introduced sequon at position 144 but did not possess the 126 sequon (Figure 5). The 2003-2004 A/Fujian/ 411/02(H3N2)-like reassorted viruses had the same glycosylation pattern as the previous season Fujian-like viruses. However, Fujian-like viruses that neither possessed the 126 nor the 144 potential glycosylation sequons were also observed, resulting in a total of eight potential sites only. The A/Wellington/1/04(H3N2)-like viruses from 2003-2004 season possessed ten potential glycosylation sites. In addition to the eight conserved they had glycosylation sites at position 126 and 144. The A/ California/7/04(H3N2) and A/Wisconsin/67/05(H3N2)like viruses from 2004 to 2006 have the same ten glycosylation sites as the A/Wellington/1/04(H3N2)-like viruses. Both position 126 and 144 are located at HA antigenic site A. Six potential N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted for N2 strains from 1999 to 2003, namely: 61, 70, 86, 93, 146 and 234 (Figure 5).

The 93 predicted sequon was seen again in three (A/Wisconsin/67/ 05(H3N2)-like) out of ten isolates from the 2005-2006 season. The same glycosylation pattern was observed for the NA of both H3N2 and H1N2 sequences. The H1 HA strains from 1999 to 2006 have seven predicted potential N-linked glycosylation sites in HA1 (11, 23, 54, 87, 125, 159, 286) and one in HA2 (480) (H1 lineage II numbering) (Figure 5). The exception is one single isolate (A/Denmark/03/05) from 2004-2005 which lacked the sequon at position 54. The isolates in lineage I possessed one additional sequon at position 268; however the calculated potential was below the threshold value of 0.5 and therefore not counted (Figure 5). Three out of four HA H1N2 sequences lacked the position 87 sequon. The eight potential glycosylation sites in the N1 NA protein have been conserved since 1999 (positions 44, 58, 63, 70, 88, 146, 235 and 434).Sequence data The proposed \"jump\" in the evolution of H3 with the introduction of the A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses in 2002-2003 can also be seen in Figure 6. Rather than constant drift the genes have evolved in a more stochastic like process (Figure 6). The evolution of H3N2 viruses was influenced by a reassortment event in 2003-2004 where the drifted A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses acquired a A/New York/55/01(H3N2)-like backbone from viruses that circulated in 2001-2002 and to some extent in 2002-2003 (Figure 2, 3 and 4). The 2003-2004 viruses had few variations in the HA compared to the previous season and the 2005-2006 viruses had few variations compared to viruses circulating the season before, both in HA and NA genes (Figure 6B). These stasis-periods might indicate a well fit virus in less need for change.",

The fitness of the Fujian-like viruses in Denmark was increased by a reassortment event in 2003-2004 when drifted HA A/ Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses acquired the rest of the genome from A/New York/55/01(H3N2)-like viruses seasons before. The reassortment has also been observed for isolates from New York State[28]. This reassorted strain caused the only epidemic in the study period in Denmark. The increased fitness could have been a result of a more effective New York-like NA, compared to the weak Fujianlike NA circulating the season before shown by others[30].The HA genes from viruses circulating after 2002-2003 are derived from the A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like viruses. The viruses circulating in the 2005-2006 season had few variations in HA and NA compared to the viruses circulating the season before. However; the internal genes of the A/Wisconcin/67/05(H3N2)-like viruses, especially PA, NP and M, were more realated to the A/Fujian/411/ 02(H3N2)-like viruses rather than the previous seasons A/ California/07/04(H3N2)-like viruses. Two H1N1 lineages, lineage I (A/Bayern/7/95(H1N1)like) and II (A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like), cocirculated in the 2000-2001 season in Denmark. A variant of A/Beijing/262/95(H1N1)-like viruses with the K130 deletion was isolated in New Caledonia in the southern Pacific in 1999, A/New Caledonia/H1N1) for the 2000-2001 season [32]. Since the introduction of the A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like viruses to Denmark in 2000-2001 there have been few substitutions in the glycoproteins. This is also seen in the rest of the world and the H1N1 component in the trivalent vaccine recommended for the northern hemisphere has been A/New Caldonia/20/99(H1N1) since 2000-2001. The greater variability of the 2005-2006 H1N1 viruses observed in the phylogenetic trees possibly indicates that the virus is changing. If the new viruses are able to evade the host immune system more efficiently, H1N1 may become the prevalent strain again in near future. The reassorted H1N2 strain was first observed in Denmark in 2002-2003, while circulating in many parts of the world in 2001-2002",

This indicate that the preferred antigenic site in the change to A/ Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-like strains was site B (P epitope = 0.190). The A/California/7/04(H3N2)-like strains from 2004-2005 showed changes at seven positions in the Bcell antigenic sites compared to the A/Fujian/411/ 02(H3N2)-like strains (Table 2) and again the preferred antigenic site for change was site B (P epitope = 0.143). Several changes were also observed at antigenic site D (P epitope = 0.073) (Table 2). The H3 strain component of the 2006-2007 influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere was A/Wisconsin/ 67/05(H3N2). We measured the rate of change at antigenic sites between the A/California/7/04(H3N2)-like viruses from 2004-2005 and the 2005-2006 A/Wisconsin/67/2005(H3N2)-like viruses. Only two substitutions at HA antigenic sites defined the A/Wisconcin/67/ 2005(H3N2)-like viruses (Table 2). Amino acids at positions 225 to 227 in H3 have greatly changed the last sea-sons (Table 1). Position 226 and 227 are directly involved in the antigenic site D. Since the introduction of Fujian like strains in 2002-2003 there have been substitutions at sites that may influence the capacity for egg growth; 131, 155, 156, 186, 222, 225 and 226 (possibly also positions 144, 145, 159 and 193) [10](Table 1). Amino acids 193, 222, 225, 226 and 227 are involved in receptor binding sites in the HA, therefore the changes observed at these sites in our dataset may influence receptor binding. Amino acids defining the Tcell epitopes (after the list of Suzuki[11]) in HA have remained unchanged since 1999.",
