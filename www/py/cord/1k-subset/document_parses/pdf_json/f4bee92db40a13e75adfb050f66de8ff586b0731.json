Prior studies demonstrated that two extended domains of ribosomal protein L3 form an allosteric switch between the pre-and post-translocational states. Missing was an explanation for how the movements of these domains are communicated among the ribosome's functional centers. Here, a third domain of L3 called the basic thumb, that protrudes roughly perpendicular from the W-finger and is nestled in the center of a cagelike structure formed by elements from three separate domains of the large subunit rRNA is investigated. Mutagenesis of basically charged amino acids of the basic thumb to alanines followed by detailed analyses suggests that it acts as a molecular clamp, playing a role in allosterically communicating the ribosome's tRNA occupancy status to the elongation factor binding region and the peptidyltransferase center, facilitating coordination of their functions through the elongation cycle. The observation that these mutations affected translational fidelity, virus propagation and cell growth demonstrates how small structural changes at the atomic scale can propagate outward to broadly impact the biology of cell.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Analyses of a growing number of high resolution ribosome structures coupled with kinetic studies are revealing that the ribosome is highly dynamic, capable of assuming >40 different conformational states through the translation elongation cycle [reviewed in (1) ]. Thus, a critical question is how the ribosome coordinates all of these states to ensure the directionality and fidelity of protein synthesis. The general answer lies in allostery: the formation and breaking of specific intermolecular contacts in response to different ligand binding states serves as a series of switches to ensure that the ribosome is optimally configured to proceed to the next functional state.

The latter two structures interact with the eEF1A-aa-tRNA-GTP ternary complex and eEF2 (the eukaryotic translation elongation factor homologs of bacterial EF-Tu-aa-tRNA-GTP ternary complex and EF-G, respectively). The 3D rendering in Figure 1B shows that L3 contains a globular domain that interfaces with the solvent side of the LSU, and two structures, the N-terminal extension and a central loop that extend deep into the central core of the LSU. The central loop can be subdivided into two domains, the 'tryptophan finger' (W-finger) positioned at the tip of the central extension, and a cluster of basic amino acids that protrudes from the center of the internal loop like a thumb roughly perpendicular to the W-finger that we call the L3 'basic thumb'. Figure 1C shows that this basic thumb is nestled in the core of a cagelike structure formed by elements of three different 25S rRNA helices: H61, H73 and H90.

Inspection of the results revealed two general trends. First, that the mutants promoted significant changes in rRNA structure in the peptidyltransferase center (U2953, U2955, G2977), along the path taken by aa-tRNA as it accommodates into the LSU (accommodation corridor, G2912, U2924, C2929, A2934), in Helix 94 where it interacts with the globular domain of L3 (G3003, A3006, G3009), and in Helix 95 (U3019, U3023, A3033). Secondly, while the mutants only altered the Helix 73-Helix 95 region when only the P-site was occupied by Ac-aa-tRNA, the majority of changes in the Helix 91-93 region were observed when both A-and P-sites were occupied. Detailed analyses reveal that the R247A mutant conferred the largest number of changes in rRNA structure, promoting deprotection of C2985 in Helix 91, G3003, A3006, G3009 in Helix 94, and U3019, U3023 and A3033 in Helix 95 when only the P-site was occupied ( Figure 4A and B). In contrast, this mutant promoted increased deprotection of G2912 in Helix 92, U2924 in the A-loop, A2934 in the bulge between Helix 92 and Helix 90, and U2955 in the peptidyltransferase center when the A-site was occupied by aa-tRNA. This mutant also caused hyperprotection of A2987 in Helix 73 when the A-site was occupied. Some of the other mutants had similar effects on some but not all of the same bases, e.g. K237A caused deprotection of G2912 and U2955, and enhanced protection of A2987 when the A-site was occupied. Other mutant specific effects were observed. For example, when only the P-site was occupied K247A promoted enhanced protection of G2977, while both K247A and K236A promoted deprotection of A2995 and U2953 under these conditions ( Figure 4A and B). K237A also promoted increased protection from 1M7 at G2977 when both the A-and P-sites were occupied. R232A had significant effects in the 3 0 loop between H90 and H92, and in the peptidyltransferase center (U2955). The observation that the bulged A2971 in Helix 93 was generally deprotected when only the P-site was occupied by Ac-aa-tRNA Phe , but became protected from chemical attack upon loading of aa-tRNA Phe into the A-site (Figure 4 ) serves as an important control, as this site occupancy-specific conformational change has also been observed for bacterial ribosomes (51) .

For example, the C-terminal extension of E. coli S13 is thought to help coordinate movement of the peptidyl-tRNA with structural rearrangements at the ribosome interface that are critical for translocation by sampling the tRNA occupancy status at the decoding center (52, 53) . The N-terminal 'hook' of yeast L10 (E. coli L16) is believed to play an active role to coordinate switching of the ribosome between the pre-and post-translocational states (16) . Ribosomal protein L2, which is intimately intertwined with multiple domains of the LSU, is thought to coordinate long range interactions between tRNAs and the ribosome (14) . Ribosomal protein L3 is of particular interest because of its function as a 'gatekeeper' to the ribosomal A-site (13) . A follow-up study suggested that two critical structures of L3, the W-finger and the N-terminal extension, function together as a 'rocker switch' to coordinate LSU associated functions (17) . The L3 basic thumb is of interest because it appears to provide the structural link in this rocker switch mechanism. Protruding roughly perpendicular from the L3 W-finger toward the intersubunit face of the LSU, it is surrounded by a cagelike structure formed by a large bulge framed between Helices H61-64, Helix 73, Helix 90 and Helix 94. It is in the center of a nexus connecting the W-finger with the L3 globular domain, the peptidyltransferase center, the aa-tRNA accommodation corridor, and the SRL. Furthermore, it is proximal to the B5 intersubunit bridge, which involves multiple contacts involving bases in Helices 62 and 64 (54) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 605, "end": 609, "text": "(52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 610, "end": 613, "text": "53)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 788, "end": 792, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 963, "end": 967, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1087, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1279, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1917, "end": 1921, "text": "(54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Unlike the small subunit (SSU), where the four rRNA domains are largely physically distinct, the six rRNA domains of the LSU are highly intertwined (54) . With regard to the current study, the loop bounded by Helices 61-64 lie in domain IV, the PTC and Helices 90-93 and Helix 73 are in domain V, and Helices 94 and 95 are in domain IV. Previously, we demonstrated that the conformationally dynamic nature of the W-finger enables the central extension of L3 to function like a lever, and as such contribute to allosteric repositioning of rRNA structural elements (13, 17) . However, it was not clear how a small radial movement of thin, essentially planer element, could have such large and long ranging effects on rRNA structure and ribosome function. The perpendicular orientation of the basic thumb may answer this: we propose that it amplifies the action of this lever by adding three-dimensionality to the central extension in the form of a platform upon which structural elements from three different domains of 25S rRNA are anchored. In support of this, comparison of the L3 structures between EF-Tu and EF-G bound Thermus thermophilus ribosomes (55) reveals displacement of the a-carbon backbone of the W-finger and basic thumb structures by $2-3 \u00c5 , and of some individual sidechains by as much as 5 \u00c5 (Supplementary Figure S1) . This model explains how The large number of basically charged amino acids in the basic thumb enables it to participate in numerous hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions with rRNA bases, phosphates and riboses, functioning as a 'molecular clamp' to bridge these three domains. The current study focusing on eight amino acids in the L3 basic thumb neutralized their positive charges with alanine substitutions both singly and in selected pairs. The lethality of the R240A mutant as the sole form of L3 indicates that it may function to 'glue' the PTC proximal stem of H90 with the H61-H64 loop, and may well aid in coordinating formation of the C2876-G2922-G2951 Aminor motif that is critical for the 'induced fit' function of the peptidyltransferase center (5, 6) . Similarly, R247, which bridges Helix 61 with Helix 90 had profound effects on rRNA structure, ribosome biochemistry, translational fidelity, and cell growth, suggesting that it too is a critical bridging component between these two domains. Interestingly, the R247A/R248A double mutant was lethal, while R248A had a wild-type phenotype. This confirms the role of R247 and also indicates that the molecular defect conferred by the R247A single mutant might be partially complemented by the positively charged R248 adjacent to it. R240A and R247A appear to be the exception rather than the rule however, as the other single mutants had significantly lesser effects on these parameters. This is consistent with mutagenesis studies on other residues of L3, and with other LSU proteins and rRNA bases (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) 17, 23, (56) (57) , suggesting that the ribosome is an elegantly evolved molecular machine containing multiple levels of functional redundancy. Furthermore, all of the double mutants tested had strong effects on binding of aa-tRNA and eEF2, and on peptidyltransfer (Figure 3 ), suggesting that it multiple defects are generally required to disrupt the functionally redundant interactions between the basic thumb and the LSU rRNA. As an aside, the observation that A2926 (base paired to U2920) was protected from 1M7 modification in wild-type ribosomes when both Aand P-sites were occupied by tRNAs but deprotected when only the P-site was occupied ( Figure 4A ) is unique to yeast. To our knowledge, this has not been observed in E. coli ribosomes (51), which contains a G-C base pair (C2551-G2557) at this position, a conformational difference that suggests a potentially novel antibiotic target. Interestingly, Haloarcula marismortui appears to split the difference with a G-U base pair (U2576-G2582).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 152, "text": "(54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 563, "end": 567, "text": "(13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 568, "end": 571, "text": "17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1157, "text": "(55)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2104, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2107, "text": "6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2906, "end": 2910, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2911, "end": 2915, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2916, "end": 2920, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2921, "end": 2925, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2926, "end": 2930, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2931, "end": 2934, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2935, "end": 2938, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2939, "end": 2943, "text": "(56)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2944, "end": 2948, "text": "(57)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1326, "end": 1336, "text": "Figure S1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3196, "end": 3205, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 3581, "end": 3590, "text": "Figure 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Some specific changes in rRNA structure are particularly telling.

The enhanced deprotection of this base in R247A mutant ribosomes when both A-and P-sites were occupied by tRNAs is consistent with its strong effect on peptidyltransferase activity by this mutation (Figure 3 H) . Interestingly, this base was also strongly deprotected under the same conditions in K237A mutant ribosomes, but in this case peptidyltransferase activity as monitored using the puromycin reaction was actually enhanced ( Figure 3H ).

Homologous yeast 25S rRNA and E. coli 23S rRNA bases pertinent to this study observed in the current study ($0.3 min \u00c01 ) and in similar analyses using E. coli ribosomes are significantly lower than naturally occurring rates [estimated to be >300 s \u00c01 , (58) ] because Ac-Phe-tRNA is a poor substrate for this reaction. However, this property actually enables us to tease out the effects of local structural changes on PTC activity. Recent molecular dynamics simulations of portions of the ribosome reveal that individual bases can undergo a conservable degree of structural mobility due to local Brownian movements [reviewed in (59) ], suggesting that specific bases in the PTC are relatively free to assume either the induced or uninduced conformations in the absence of tRNAs, and that the equilibrium between these two states is influenced by the presence or absence of aa-tRNA in the A-site. Thus, we suggest that R247A mutant drives this equilibrium toward the uninduced conformation, while the K237A mutant favors the induced arrangement. The observation of distinctly different patterns of rRNA protection/ deprotection (e.g. compare G2912, C2929, U2953, G2977, C2985, A2995, G3003, A3006, G3009, U3019, U3023 and A3033 between the K237A and R247A mutants in Figure 4A ) is consistent with the idea that they also have opposing effects on PTC conformation and functionality. In addition, early studies demonstrated that while empty ribosomes are heterogeneous in their affinity for eEF2, consisting of two sub-populations having K d 's for eEF2 ranging from subnanomolar to hundreds of nanomoles (60), the affinity for eEF2 strongly depends on the functional status of the ribosome as determined by the occupancy status of the A-and P-sites (61, 62) . This suggests that the R247A and the double mutants that increased eEF2 affinity shift this equilibrium as well, possibly stabilizing ribosomes in the pre-translocation state, and that the interactions between the 25S rRNA bases and L3 amino acid residues investigated here are involved in transitions between the pre-and post-translocational states.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 209, "end": 212, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 691, "end": 699, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2154, "text": "(58)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2525, "end": 2529, "text": "(59)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 3645, "end": 3649, "text": "(61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3650, "end": 3653, "text": "62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 425, "text": "(Figure 3 H)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 648, "end": 657, "text": "Figure 3H", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1893, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3163, "end": 3172, "text": "Figure 4A", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "As discussed above, the effects of the K237A mutant are locally confined to the PTC, while those conferred by R247A are more global.

Examination of the ligand binding data reveals a reciprocal relationship between affinities for aa-tRNA and eEF2, i.e. increased aa-tRNA K d correlates with decreased eEF2 K d (Figure 3 ). This is consistent with the model that L3 plays a central role as an allosteric switch to coordinate binding of elongation factors, opening and closing of the accommodation corridor, and PTC activity to ensure the unidirectionality of protein synthesis (13, 17) . Interestingly, all of the mutants affected peptidyltransfer, consistent with observations that this process is highly sensitive to even minor structural changes in the ribosome [reviewed in (63) ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 786, "end": 790, "text": "(13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 791, "end": 794, "text": "17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 987, "end": 991, "text": "(63)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 520, "end": 529, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In the end, the most important parameter is life; i.e. how does the L3 basic thumb contribute to the fitness of the organism? While only some of the mutants had gross effects on cell growth, they all affected translational fidelity as monitored by decreased rates of \u00c01 PRF (Figure 2 ). In fact, the effects on \u00c01 PRF correlated well with the A-site aa-tRNA-binding data. For example, R247A and K241A/R244A, which had the most pronounced effects on \u00c01 PRF, also promoted >3-fold decreases in affinity for aa-tRNA. In contrast, R232A and K236A, which had the smallest effects on aa-tRNA binding, also promoted the smallest decreases in \u00c01 PRF. As noted above, the mutants investigated in this report are unique in that they are the first examples that promoted decreased \u00c01 PRF. This trend had only previously been observed with anisomycin, a competitive inhibitor for aa-tRNA 3 0 binding to the PTC (41) . We have suggested that the majority of \u00c01 PRF occurs after aa-tRNA accommodation into the A-site, and prior to peptidyltransfer, while a smaller fraction can occur during translocation [reviewed in (64) ], a view that is supported by a recent study coupling kinetic modeling of \u00c01 PRF within the translation elongation cycle with mass spectroscopic analyses of frameshifted peptide products (P.-Y. Liao et al., submitted for publication). By this model, decreased rates of aa-tRNA accommodation into the A-site should decrease the steady state abundance of substrate for \u00c01 PRF, thus inhibiting this reaction. Changes in \u00c01 PRF in turn alter the relative amounts of viral protein products available for viral particle self assembly, a ratio that is critical for virus propagation (18, 40) . This illustrates how minute changes in ribosome structure at the atomic scale can propagate outward, affecting ribosome biochemistry, translational fidelity, and the ability of cells to replicate viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 899, "end": 903, "text": "(41)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1108, "text": "(64)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1690, "text": "(18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1694, "text": "40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 283, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Ribosome structure and dynamics during translocation and termination", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Dunkle", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Cate", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2010, "venue": "Annu.
