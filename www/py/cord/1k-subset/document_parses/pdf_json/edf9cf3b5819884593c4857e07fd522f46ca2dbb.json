Authoritative action and provision of information to the public can help in avoiding public disquiet or panic and in mitigating the societal risks of a pandemic, complementing the direct health effects of any interventions. Conversely, disagreement over the scientific evidence base, particularly where considerable uncertainties and gaps in information exist, can open the way to debate based primarily on established beliefs and prejudices. In the face of a future event such as an influenza pandemic, the timing and precise nature of which is unknown, robust preparation will be strengthened by an agreed scientific understanding of the risks and the options for response.",

These papers were reviewed and revised by additional national and international expert scientific reviewers and subsequently at a colloquium, convened by the Secretary of State for Health, of scientific experts. Revised papers were then submitted to the Scientific Advisory Group for final endorsement as reflecting an accurate and comprehensive summary of the state of knowledge in June 2007. The final endorsed papers have now been made publicly available as a resource to all. 1 Papers reviewing the scientific evidence base in the following areas are available at: http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/ spi/evidence.htm (i) The use of antiviral drugs in a pandemic; (ii) pre-pandemic and pandemic specific influenza vaccines; (iii) the use of antibiotics for pandemic influenza; (iv) the use of face masks during a pandemic; and (v) the risk of a pandemic originating from H5N1.",
