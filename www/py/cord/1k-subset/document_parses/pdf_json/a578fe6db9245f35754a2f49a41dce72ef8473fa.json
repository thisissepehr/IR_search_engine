The cycling conditions were 50 cycles (94\u00b0C for 30 s, 53\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min) after a preheating step of 10 min at 95\u00b0C. All PCR products of positive reactions by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining were sequenced completely in both directions for confi rmation of sequence specifi city. One negative control was extracted and amplifi ed for every 5 NPA samples. A plasmid containing the cloned PCR product was used as positive control. The sensitivity of the WUPyV PCR was 8.8 copies per reaction as determined by probit analysis, which corresponds to 440 copies per mL of sample. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty at the University of W\u00fcrzburg.",

The median age of the patients was 1.6 years (mean age 3.2 years; range 7 days-22 years), and 58.4% were boys. DNA of 1,277 NPA from 1,085 children was available for retrospective testing. Of these, 62 (4.9%) samples from 59 children were positive by WUPyV PCR and subsequent sequencing. The median age of the WUPyVpositive children was 3.0 years (mean 2.9 years; range 4 months-6.3 years) ( Figure) , and 57% were boys. Of the children with WUPyV-positive NPA, 3.2% were >6 years of age, although children in this age group constituted 15.7% of the total population. Infections with WUPyV were found year round, but most occurred in the winter months. Yearly frequencies (July-June) of WUPyV-positive results varied from 3.2% to 8.5% during the observation period. These variations were not statistically signifi cant. In 34 (54.8%) of the WUPyV-positive samples, co-infections with other respiratory viruses were detected, most frequently with adenovirus (n = 10) and fl uA (n = 10), followed by hBoV (n = 9) and RSV (n = 5). The co-infections bronchitis, wheezing bronchitis, and pneumonia.",

            "text": "In the context of the previous reports of WUPyV detection in Australia and North America (3), our data suggest a worldwide distribution of WUPyV. Most of the WUPyV-positive children were <4 years of age, and WUPyV DNA was rarely found in children >6 years of age. This age distribution is compatible with WUPyV infection occurring in day nurseries and kindergartens. In keeping with the fi ndings of Gaynor et al. (3), we observed a high number of co-infections. The true number of co-infections in our study is probably higher than the reported 53.2% because we did not test for several respiratory pathogens, such as coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and the human metapneumovirus. Hypotheses to account for the detection of WUPyV in respiratory samples include the following: WUPyV is a persisting asymptomatic virus that is detected by chance, WUPyV is a persisting virus that is reactivated by an infl ammatory process, or WUPyV is a predisposing or aggravating factor of respiratory diseases. Further studies are necessary to determine whether WUPyV is a human pathogen.",
