We specified multivariable linear regression models for the log viral load on the first and third measurement (typically 0 and 7 days, respectively, after recruitment), with the same slope but separate intercepts for each individual to allow for between-person variability in peak viral loads. We fitted separate models for each study and for influenza A and B and adjusted for age and oseltamivir treatment. Interaction terms with time were included to allow the slope of the regression line to vary by age and oseltamivir treatment. Viral loads for specimens with measured load below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were imputed as half the LLOQ. This random-effects regression model constructed using the first and third measurement was used to predict viral loads expected on the second measurement (typically 3 days after recruitment), which were then compared with the observed viral loads on the second swabs, which were collected by the patients in IRIS and by an HCP in the HTS. We calculated mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the t distribution.",

Our results therefore support the feasibility and validity of using self-swabs as an alternative approach to permit laboratory confirmation of influenza-associated illnesses in a community setting.",

Our results further extend this to selfcollected swabs by patients in the community setting, both for qualitative disease confirmation and quantitative viral load estimation. In the IRIS, 90% of self-collected swabs contained detectable influenza virus approximately 4-6 days after illness onset, indicating no substantial loss in sensitivity for qualitative virus detection through this approach. In the HTS, the lower proportion of specimens with detectable virus in the second swab can be attributed to the slightly longer average delay from illness onset.",

For influenza B, there was no significant difference between those obtained from selfswabs and the values predicted from the other 2 swabs by HCPs ( Figure 1G and 1H) . For influenza A, overall trends in viral loads between the 2 studies also appear similar ( Figure 1A and 1B) . Although self-swabs from the IRIS were associated with a lower viral load than the predicted value ( Figure 1E and 1F), these results should be interpreted with some caution as differences in the type of swabs and transport media used, collection site and technique, delays between collection and transport to the laboratory, and laboratory procedures between studies may have led to artifactual differences. We therefore only compared the predicted and observed viral loads within each study because results from the 2 studies were not directly comparable. Although the log-linear model fit the data well and provided reasonable predictions of viral loads in the HTS (Figure 1 ), more complex models might better represent the decline in viral loads over time. Although we did not explicitly model the shedding patterns of different influenza A subtypes, we have not previously identified substantial differences [2, 5] .",

For the IRIS, the lower limit of detection (LLOD) of the influenza A assay was 54 viral particles per milliliter (vp/mL), and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 131 vp/mL; the LLOD of the influenza B assay was 168 vp/mL, and the LLOQ was 194 vp/mL. For the HTS, the LLOD of the influenza A and B assays was 550 copies/mL, and the LLOQ was 900 copies/mL. a community setting. Because of the need for multiple sequential respiratory specimens over the course of illness, such studies typically require multiple clinic visits by the patients or multiple home visits by the HCPs and are thus costly and complicated, which may also affect study compliance. Self-swab would thus be an attractive alternative, and further validation of this approach would benefit the design of future community-based studies. Further studies employing collection of NTSs by both the patients and HCPs in a parallel or randomized fashion could help to enable finer calibration of the measurements obtained by self-swabs.",
