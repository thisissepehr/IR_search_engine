An immunoassay with the potential for the detection of influenza was developed and tested using hemagglutinin (HA), a commonly studied glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza virions. Gold nanoparticles were synthesized, which present multiple peptide epitopes, including the HA epitope, in order to increase the gravimetric response achieved with the use of a QCM immunosensor for influenza. Specifically, epitopes associated with HA and FLAG peptides were affixed to gold nanoparticles by a sixmer PEG spacer between the epitope and the terminal cysteine. The PEG spacer was shown to enhance the probability for interaction with antibodies by increasing the distance the epitope extends from the gold surface. These nanoparticles were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight, and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies were adhered to the surface of a QCM, and the response of each antibody upon exposure to HA, FLAG, and dual functionalized nanoparticles was compared with binding of Au-tiopronin nanoparticles and H5 HA proteins from influenza virus (H5N1). Results demonstrate that the immunoassay was capable of differentiating between nanoparticles presenting orthogonal epitopes in real-time with minimal nonspecific binding.

Improving diagnostics for viruses, such as influenza, would help slow the spread of infection in the event of an emerging virus. It is known that even with reassortment, a common viral defense mechanism, the majority of anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibodies recognize a specific nine amino acid sequence within the epitope, AYDPVDYPY, which has been the focus of many assays to improve the detection of influenza [3] . Using this immunodominant sequence for the HA epitope, the influenza epitope can be mimicked with a functionalized nanoparticle yielding a comparable affinity to the linear peptide [4] . Another virus, Ebola, has also been effectively mimicked with a monolayer-protected cluster (MPC) through functionalization of the MPC with the antigenic determinant of the Ebola glycoprotein [5] .

Unfortunately, pathogenic agent detection requires calibration with irradiated or otherwise attenuated samples of the organism. This requirement limits the widespread use of immunosensor diagnostics because of the scarcity of these agents and the logistic difficulty in safe transportation to remote locations.

The possibility of exposure and high cost are enough to warrant investigation into a safer positive control for these disease detection assays and devices.

MPCs in this work had an average diameter of 2.6\u00b1 0.6 nm.

Since then, extensive work has been done to establish the use of the QCM to probe interactions in a liquid environment, involving suitable oscillator circuits, fluid modeling in viscous and lossy fluids, as well as determination of the relationship between motional resistance and mass load [12, 45, 50] . The sensing layers utilized in this study should yield at most a layer 30-nm thick, using liberal estimates, where the Sauerbrey equation can be applicable to thin films less than 250 nm [51] [52] [53] [54] . Previous work, which uses a sucrose calibration, modifies the Sauerbrey equation to account for the changes that do occur in part from motional resistance, and therefore allows the ideology behind the Sauerbrey equation to apply in environments where energy is dissipated in the non-rigid liquid environment [30] . The nanoparticles increase the resistance of the crystals, and thus the rigidity, as well as decreased the frequency, resulting in a detectable increase of mass adsorbed on the surface of the crystal. Binding to the HA-antibody (positive \u0394m) occurs if the gold nanoparticle is functionalized with either HA or both HA and FLAG epitopes, but does not occur if the cluster is only FLAG functionalized (Fig. 3a) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1372, "end": 1376, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1380, "text": "45,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1384, "text": "50]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1578, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1583, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1588, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1593, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1908, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 68, "end": 75, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 572, "end": 581, "text": "(Fig. 3a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 607, "end": 616, "text": "(Fig. 3b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2319, "text": "(Fig. 3a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "The nonspecific binding observed with ELISA of Autiopronin to anti-HA was not observed with the QCM. QCM naturally prohibits nonspecific binding through the acceleration of adhered particles. This acceleration is generated by the oscillation of the quartz and can help remove weakly bound or nonspecifically bound molecules [55, 56] . Similar binding of anti-FLAG to FLAG-Au and HA-Au-FLAG but not HA-Au was measured with the QCM (Fig. 3b) . Thus, orthogonal and normalized binding at the QCM is observed consistent with immunological results obtained from ELISA, but is observable in a much shorter time interval (10 min compared to the 4 h it took to complete the ELISAs) when using the developed immunoassay and the QCM. The demonstrated binding between bi-functionalized nanoparticles and their respective antibodies makes evident the practicality of their use as a simulant for microorganisms, while lacking the difficulties associated with use of an attenuated or killed pathogen. When a change in Fig. 4 Calibration of HA protein binding to anti-HA. a The average change in mass of H5N1 HA protein binding was determined at varying concentrations. Briefly, (black line) 40 \u03bcg/mL (n=2), (red line) 20 \u03bcg/mL (n=5), (blue line) 10 \u03bcg/mL (n=3), (teal line) 5 \u03bcg/mL (n=3), and (pink line) 1 \u03bcg/mL (n=4). Also shown for comparison is the binding of HA-Au (green line) and HA-FLAG-Au (orange line). b A linear representation of the Langmuir isotherm produced by this average binding is shown with a linear relationship of y \u00bc 0:035 AE 0:004 \u00f0 \u00de x \u00fe 4:90 AE 15:5 \u00f0 \u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c010 and R 2 =0.96. c Calibration curve for an assay time of 1.5 min where the black squares are HA proteins, and the red and blue dots are HA-FLAG-Au and HA-FLAG, respectively b mass is observed upon introduction of the functionalized MPC to the immunosensor, the immunological response is shown to be above the limit of detection (\u223c3 ng, calculated by three times the average noise). Results show the average change in mass for protein G to be 128\u00b148 ng, for antibodies to be 276\u00b175 ng, and for the nanoparticle simulants to be 37\u00b18 ng (Table 1 ). While the time was held constant for each step, the binding varied slightly, which could be due to slight variations in surface roughness and the surface coverage of prior adsorption steps. Even with a standard deviation of 75 ng for antibody adsorption, a deviation of only 8 ng was measured for the final detection step. The binding of the nanoparticles demonstrates saturation behavior (Fig. 3) . Based on the shape of the QCM curves and the rapid increase in mass with time, it can be assumed that the kinetics would occur quickly and with presumably large equilibrium association constants. To test this theory, a calibration of anti-HA to HA binding was determined, and the binding of the functionalized nanoparticles was compared. The HA protein from H5N1 was exposed to anti-HA antibodies at concentrations ranging from 1 to 40 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 4a, b) . This binding can be compared at any time point to generate a calibration curve (Fig. 4c , example shown is at 1.5 min). Based upon the desired separation of the lower data points, the binding can continue for several more minutes. Also, the amount of nanoparticle exposed to the surface can be lowered to prevent overloading of the sensor. Measuring the maximum binding that occurs, as opposed to lower time points, can be used to determine the equilibrium association constant (K a ) and increase our understanding of the affinity of our sensor. This constant was determined by fitting to a linear rearrangement of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, where C was plotted versus C/\u0394m (Eq. 3, Fig. 4b ) [30] :", "cite_spans": [{"start": 324, "end": 328, "text": "[55,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 329, "end": 332, "text": "56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3677, "end": 3681, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 439, "text": "(Fig. 3b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1010, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2108, "end": 2116, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2509, "end": 2517, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2962, "end": 2974, "text": "(Fig. 4a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3056, "end": 3064, "text": "(Fig. 4c", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3667, "end": 3674, "text": "Fig. 4b", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "This yielded an equilibrium association constant for the binding between the HA protein and anti-HA of 7.14\u00b1 0.26\u00d710 7 .

In fitting the binding of the nanoparticles to this Langmuir isotherm calibration (at the experimentally used nanoparticle concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL), the sensor response to HA-FLAG-Au would have the same binding as 0.92\u00b10.01 \u03bcM HA protein, and HA-Au would generate the same sensor response as 1.50\u00b10.02 \u03bcM HA protein. The large response seen is at the maximum of the Langmuir isotherm. This demonstrates that even at lower concentrations, these functionalized nanoparticles can be used as a positive control.

Interaction of the epitope with its antibody was improved through the use of a PEG linkage for epitope attachment to the MPC.
