Likewise, there are nine alleles for NA, and two alleles for non-structural (NS) proteins. Since influenza A viruses have an unusual genomic structure, we approached the genotyping problem by first analyzing each gene segment separately. According to the above conventions and considering that the evolutionary rate varies from segment to segment, we defined a genotype as a sequential combination of the lineages for each of the eight segments in a genome. A letter was assigned to each lineage of PB2, PB1, PA, NP and M, and a number followed by a letter was assigned to each lineage of HA, NA and NS with the number representing the subtype or allele. For example, [A,D,B,3A,A,2A,B,1A] is the genotype of a human seasonal subtype H3N2 virus with PB2 lineage A, PB1 lineage D, PA lineage B, HA subtype 3, lineage A and so on, following the convention for numbering of influenza genome segments.

Using FluGenome, this H3N2 virus had the genotype [C,D,E,3A,A,2A,A,1A] (Figure 3). It has been reported that this new genotype (termed 'triple reassortant') arose from reassortment events between human H3N2 viruses, swine H1N1 viruses and North American avian viruses of unknown serotype(27). The potential parent human H3N2 been circulating in humans since 1968 and has a genotype of [A,D,B,3A,A,2A,B,1A]. The triple reassortant virus acquired its HA, NA and PB1 gene segments from this seasonal human H3N2. The PB2 and PA genes arose from reassortment with avian viruses found in North America (with PB2 internal gene similar to A/mallard/ ALB/126/1991 (CY005317) and PA gene similar to A/ blue-winged teal/Alberta/141/1992 (CY004543)). The remaining three gene segments (NP, MP, NS) come from the classical H1N1 swine viruses whose genotype is [B,A,C,1A,A,1B,A,1A]. Although the NP and NS lineages are shared between the classical swine and human influenza viruses, the BLAST results show the closest matching isolates are swine in origin.
