DAMPs can be secreted either actively or passively following necrosis but are not released by apoptotic cells [4] and have activating eff ects on receptorexpressing cells engaged in host defense. DAMPs can also be detected by TLRs and NLRs and their engagement induces NF-\u03baB activation as well, suggesting that DAMPs and PAMPs use, at least partially, the same receptors and signaling pathways. Liu et al. [5] however, propose that the immune system treats DAMPs and PAMPs diff erently; they suggest that DAMPs -but not PAMPs -bring CD24-Siglec G/10 into the proximity of TLRs/NLRs, resulting in repressed DAMP-induced TLR/NLR signaling.",

In addition, the multiligand receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is regarded as a prototypic DAMP receptor that can bind several DAMPs, including HMGB1 and S100A12 [6] . Other known RAGE ligands include amyloid, \u03b2-sheet fi brils, S100B and S100P [7] ; furthermore, \u03b22 integrins can interact with RAGE [8] . RAGE is expressed at high levels in the lungs and at low levels in normal adult tissues, including on cells involved in the innate immune system, e.g., neutrophils, T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells [7] . Engagement of RAGE by its ligands leads to receptor-dependent signaling and activation of NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [7] . Activation of RAGE plays a role in diverse experimentally-induced sterile infl ammatory and infectious diseases, including cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced abdominal sepsis [9] , diabetic nephropathy, delayed type hypersensitivity, type II collagen induced arthritis, hepatic injury, and diabetic atherosclerosis [7, [10] [11] [12] .

Th e V domain in the extracellular part of RAGE is essential for binding of its ligands. Because of its ability to recognize three-dimensional structures rather than specifi c amino acid sequences, RAGE can interact with a wide range of ligands. RAGE was fi rst identifi ed as a receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), explaining its name. AGEs are products of the nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of lipids, proteins and other macromolecules that appear, in particular, under conditions of increased availability of reducing sugars and/or enhanced oxidative stress, especially when molecules turn over slowly and aldose levels are elevated. Further investigations showed that RAGE can recognize a diverse array of endogenous molecules that warn the immune system and induce a defensive immune response; the alarmins or DAMPs.",

            "text": "HMGB1 is a non-histone DNA-binding protein that serves as a structural component to facilitate the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes in the nucleus [14] . Extracellularly, HMGB1 functions as a cytokine. In response to infl ammatory stimuli, including PAMPs, HMGB1 can be actively released into the extracellular environment from a variety of cells including monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, enterocytes, pituicytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells [14] . HMGB1 can also be passively secreted into the extracellular milieu when cells die in a non-programmed way (necrosis), whereas apoptotic cells modify their chromatin so that HMGB1 binds irreversibly and consequently is not released [4] . During infectious diseases, increased HMGB1 concentrations may be due to active as well as passive release. Detection methods of HMGB1 that are currently used (and published) do not distinguish between these (and possible other) diff erent forms of HMGB1. More studies are necessary to: 1) Report the biological activity of (diff erent forms of ) HMGB1; and 2) develop HMGB1 ELISA assays that can distinguish between these (possibly also functionally) diff erent forms of HMGB1. Most investigations on HMGB1 and infection involve sepsis, the second leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units (ICUs) and the 10 th leading cause of death overall. Patients with severe sepsis display elevated circulating HMGB1 levels [15] [16] [17] and HMGB1 is predominantly released at the site of infection; patients with pneumonia and those with peritonitis showed increased concen trations in fl uid obtained from the bronchoalveolar space and abdomen, respectively [17] . In an animal model of CLP-induced sepsis, the kinetics of HMGB1 secretion in vivo was delayed and more sustained when compared with the release of pro-infl ammatory cytokines, like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 [18, 19] . Similarly, various interventions that inhibit HMGB1 activity or production, such as anti-HMGB1 antibodies, the A-box segment of HMGB1, ethyl pyruvate, and nicotine, reduced CLPinduced sepsis and/or LPS lethality even if treatment was delayed for many hours, up to one day after the challenge [20, 21] . An implicated crucial event in sepsis pathophysio logy is apoptosis of immune cells, playing a major role in immunosuppression and lethality [22] . HMGB1 seems to be a downstream factor of apoptosis in the fi nal common pathway to organ damage in severe sepsis as indicated by observations that prevention of lymphocyte apoptosis improved survival after CLP [23] , whereas anti-HMGB1 treatment reduced lethality in the same model without infl uencing apoptosis [19] . Th is indicates that HMGB1 secretion is a relatively late event in sepsis that contributes signifi cantly to a worsened outcome. In addition, it has been reported that very pure HMGB1 does not have cytokine-inducing capacity itself, but activates cells indirectly by fi rst acquiring immune stimulating CpG DNA [24] , which is released in the bloodstream during bacterial sepsis. However, a recent study reported that HMGB1-mediated induction of macrophage cytokine production requires binding to TLR4, and that binding and signaling are dependent on a molecular mechanism that requires cysteine in position 106 within the B box [25] . Together these data indicate that HMGB1 may exert pro-infl ammatory eff ects in a direct TLR4-dependent way and an indirect way via binding of DAMPs and other agonistic molecules. S100A12 S100A12 is a calcium binding protein expressed in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, where it comprises 5% of the total protein content. Furthermore, S100A12 -also known as EN-RAGE (extracellular newly identifi ed ligand of RAGE) or myeloid-related protein (MRP)-6 -is found in monocytes and lymphocytes and provokes pro-infl ammatory responses in endothelial cells [26] . Although many RAGE ligands are promiscuous with regard to receptor use, S100A12 has only been shown to bind to RAGE. S100A12 expression is high in infl ammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, Kawaski disease, and cystic fi brosis. Within the lungs, S100A12 and RAGE are increased during acute lung injury (ALI) [26] . S100A12 expression may refl ect activation of neutrophils during pulmonary infl ammation and may contribute to endothelial activation via binding to RAGE [26] .",

Th e predicted cytosolic portion of RAGE, consisting of 43 amino acids, is short compared to other PRRs, the TLRs and IL-1 receptors, and does not include a known signaling domain or motif. A RAGE mutant lacking this intracellular tail does not activate NF-\u03baB and behaves like a dominant negative, preventing proinfl ammatory cytokine release from macro phages. Th ese data indicate a critical role of this cytosolic portion in transducing the signal from the cell surface to the nucleus. The damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and S100A12, are released during infection ( [15, 17] , and unpublished data) and bind to and activate RAGE. It has to be determined whether other S100 proteins and other DAMPs are RAGE ligands (indicated as purple shapes) released during infection. It would be interesting to investigate whether RAGE can directly bind to, become activated and mount a fi rst immune reaction after ligation with specifi c PAMPs as well. Engagement of RAGE by its ligands results in receptor-dependent signaling and activation of NF-\u03baB leading to a pro-infl ammatory response; the signaling pathway is largely unknown. In addition, RAGE interacts as an endothelial (and epithelial) adhesion receptor with the leukocyte integrin, CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) (lower section) [8] . Furthermore, lateral (in cis) RAGE-Mac-1 interaction on the leukocyte surface is mediated by HMGB1 and activates Mac-1-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 dependent adhesion and migration and augments leukocyte recruitment [27] (indicated by the blue line and blue \"+\"). Moreover, a recent report shows that endothelially expressed RAGE acts in concert with ICAM-1 in mediating \u03b2 2 integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion during acute trauma-induced infl ammation [28] (indicated by the green line and green \"+\"). One possibility is that RAGE uses as yet unknown adaptors framing a whole `new' signaling cascade to NF-\u03baB. Another possibility is that the RAGE tail interacts with a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)-containing protein which then recruits the downstream TIR-contain ing proteins in a way analogous to TLR-mediated signaling pathways. Finally, RAGE could transduce signals from the cell surface to the nucleus by bypassing the TIR-containing adaptor, directly interacting with member(s) of the signaling cascade.",

First, sRAGE blood concentrations are associated with various infl ammatory diseases in patients and in rats with experimentally induced ALI [29] . Further more, it is suggested that sRAGE can compete with full length cell-surface RAGE for ligand engagement, preventing these ligands from binding to RAGE or other receptors and/or exerting eff ects otherwise. Exogenous sRAGE treatment indeed attenuated infl ammatory responses in several animal models, including models of type II collagen-induced arthritis, hepatic injury, diabetic atherosclerosis, delayed type hypersensitivity, and experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis [7] .

Physiologically, RAGE is expressed at high basal levels in the lungs relative to other tissues [26, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , suggesting that RAGE may have lung-specifi c functions distinct from the role of RAGE in other adult tissues. In particular, although the kidney is dramatically aff ected by microangiopathy and fi brosiswhich is substantially attributed to RAGE -in patients with diabetes, the lungs, with a signifi cantly higher baseline RAGE expression than the kidney, remain unaff ected. In addition, RAGE has been found to be specifi cally localized near the basal cell membrane within alveolar pneumocytes [32, 35, 36] . Th ese two observa tions raise the question as to whether RAGE has a function in normal healthy lungs. Indeed, Englert et al. documented that aged RAGE -/mice develop pulmonary fi brosis-like alterations spontaneously; lungs from 19 to 24 month-old RAGE -/mice showed increased collagen staining and displayed increased levels of hydroxyproline relative to wild type mice [31] . RAGE knockdown in pulmonary fi broblasts increased their proliferation and migration in vitro, suggesting an important protective function of RAGE in the lungs and that loss of RAGE may be related to functional changes of pulmonary cell types resulting in fi brotic disease [34] . Another study demonstrated that RAGE on epithelial cells promoted their adherence to human collagen (a major component of the alveolar basal lamina) and a spreading morphology, which may facilitate gas exchange and alveolar stability in vivo [34, 35] . Together, these data suggest that RAGE plays a role in maintaining lung homeostasis in normal, healthy lungs. Further studies are needed to unravel the function(s) of pulmonary RAGE in physiology in more detail.",

Lung injury induced by either bleomycin or hyperoxia is diminished in RAGE -/mice [37, 38] , suggesting a deteriorating attribution of RAGE. In contrast, Englert et al. showed that RAGE -/mice developed more severe lung fi brosis after asbestos adminis tration as measured by histological scoring and total lung hydroxyproline quantifi cation [31] . Of note, in all these studies, the mice were much younger at the time of sacrifi ce than the aged (19-24 month-old) RAGE -/mice that developed pulmonary fi brosis spontaneously in the experiment by Englert et al.

Notwithstanding, a possible role of RAGE in antibacterial defense cannot be easily evaluated from this study because host defense against CLP depends, at least in part, on the extent of intestinal necrosis and the formation of a local abscess. Also, all mice in this experiment received broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial outgrowth was only determined in mice that survived (i.e., not at predefi ned time points after CLP). For this reason, we used our model of abdominal sepsis induced by injection of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli into the peritoneum [42, 43] to study whether RAGE aff ects antibacterial defense. Th is model is a relevant tool to investigate the role of receptors/ mediators in limiting the growth and dissemination of bacteria after a primary intra-abdominal infection and to assess the contribution of these proteins to specifi c immune responses. RAGE expression was upregulated during E. coli induced sepsis [42] . RAGE defi ciency (either pharmacologically using anti-RAGE IgG antibodies or genetically using RAGE knock out mice) was related to a higher bacterial load and dissemination [42] . Th ese data indicate that RAGE signaling contributes to an eff ective antibacterial response during abdominal sepsis. RAGE exerted this eff ect probably indirectly and not via direct interaction with E. coli, considering the observation that leukocytes from RAGE -/mice had an unaltered capacity to phagocytose and kill E. coli in vitro. Furthermore, the fi nding that defi ciency of RAGE in general was associated with an exaggerated host response during E. coli sepsis [42] on the one hand, and with an attenuated infl ammatory response and better survival in (other) sterile models of intraperitoneal injection of LPS derived from E. coli [42, 44] on the other hand, suggests that although RAGE is involved in the immune reaction to E. coli, this function can be compensated for by other receptors in the presence of a growing bacterial load. Th e high-affi nity RAGE ligand, HMGB1, is secreted into the circulation systemically during clinical sepsis [16] [17] [18] as well as in our experimental sepsis model of E. coli [43] . Importantly, HMGB1 has been shown to transduce cellular signals in vitro and in vivo by interacting with at least three other receptors, i.e., TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 when HMGB1 is complexed with CPG DNA [24, 44, 45] . One possible explanation for the increased response in the RAGE lacking mice during E. coli sepsis is, therefore, that the absence of RAGE could facilitate the interaction between HMGB1 and TLR2, TLR4 and/or TLR9.",

NF-\u03baB mediated expression of pro-infl ammatory cytokines and upregulation of ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 on endothelium has been documen ted in vitro after S100A12 stimulation [47] .

Cole et al. determined that S100A12 has activity primarily against Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli [48] . Because of the absence of S100A12 in rodents, a potential functional role of S100A12 during sepsis cannot be easily investigated by inhibiting/deleting S100A12 in animals.

Knowledge on the role of endogenous sRAGE in sepsis is scarce. Hudson et al. demonstrated that sRAGE levels might represent an early marker of microvascular dysfunction, a pheno me non also present in sepsis [50] . Furthermore, increased sRAGE concentrations in sepsis might represent the acute infl ammatory status as splice variants of RAGE or as split off variants of the cell surface RAGE, the latter analogous to ICAM-1, another member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is a marker of cellular damage during sepsis. Another possibility is that systemic sRAGE levels might be elevated in parallel with HMGB1/ S100A12 levels as a counter-system against HMGB1/ S100A12 elicited tissue eff ects. More research is needed to clarify the functional role of sRAGE in sepsis and its putative role as a new sepsis marker.",

It would be highly interesting to evaluate whether RAGE can directly bind to, become activated, and mount a fi rst immune reaction after ligation with specifi c PAMPs. Furthermore, RAGE-mediated eff ects on other fi rst-line defense mechanisms, such as chemotaxis, killing, phagocytosis and respiratory burst could depend on the pathogen. As such, targeting RAGE may be ineff ective or even harmful in some infectious conditions. Th erefore, more studies are necessary to justify clinical trials targeting RAGE in patients with severe infections. In this respect one could think of research on RAGE inhibition in pneumococcal and infl uenza A viral pneumonia. Additionally, experiments in which RAGE targeting is delayed until after bacterial/viral infection and combined with antibiotic/antiviral therapy should be considered. Moreover, more studies need to be conducted on the role of RAGE in critical organ derangements involved in the pathogenesis of severe infection, including activation of the coagulation system and the complement system. RAGE remains a potential yet promising therapeutic target that awaits further research.",
