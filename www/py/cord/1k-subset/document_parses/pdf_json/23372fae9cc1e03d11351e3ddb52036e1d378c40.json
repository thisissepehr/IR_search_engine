Findings: The Richards model and its variants are used to fit the cumulative epidemic curve for laboratoryconfirmed pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) infections in Canada, made available by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The model is used to obtain estimates for turning points in the initial outbreak, the basic reproductive number (R 0 ), and for expected final outbreak size in the absence of interventions. Confirmed case data were used to construct a best-fit 2-phase model with three turning points. R 0 was estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI 1.12-1.47) for the first phase (April 1 to May 4) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.16-1.54) for the second phase (May 4 to June 19). Hospitalization data were also used to fit a 1-phase model with R 0 = 1.35 (1.20-1.49) and a single turning point of June 11. Conclusions: Application of the Richards model to Canadian pH1N1 data shows that detection of turning points is affected by the quality of data available at the time of data usage. Using a Richards model, robust estimates of R 0 were obtained approximately one month after the initial outbreak in the case of 2009 A (H1N1) in Canada.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Epidemics and outbreaks caused by emerging infectious diseases continue to challenge medical and public health authorities.

In such a model formulation, the basic reproduction number R 0 is given by the formula R 0 = exp(rT) where T is the disease generation time defined as the average time interval from infection of an individual to infection of his or her contacts.

The basic premise of the Richards model is that the incidence curve of a single phase of a given epidemic consists of a single peak of high incidence, resulting in an S-shaped cumulative epidemic curve with a single turning point for the outbreak. The turning point or inflection point, defined as the time when the rate of case accumulation changes from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) can be easily pinpointed as the point where the rate of change transitions from positive to negative; i.e., the moment at which the trajectory begins to decline.

This variant of Richards model provides a systematic method of determining whether an outbreak is single-or multi-phase in nature, and can be used to distinguish true turning points from peaks and valleys resulting from random variability in case counts.

This quantity has direct policy relevance; for example, in the autumn 2009 pH1N1 wave in Canada, vaccination for pH1N1 was initiated at or after the turning point of the autumn wave due to the time taken to produce vaccine; as the epidemic was in natural decline at that point, the impact of vaccination has subsequently been called into question.

Our estimates of R 0 is smaller than that derived by Fraser et al. [2] using Mexican data, but such differences could relate in part to the different age distributions of these two countries [17] , and may also reflect the fact that our estimate is obtained Canadian data at a national level, while empirical Mexican estimates were based on data from the town of La Gloria with only 1575 residents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1879, "end": 1883, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2507, "end": 2511, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2581, "end": 2584, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2705, "end": 2709, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1428, "end": 1435, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1577, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1590, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 2021, "end": 2029, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Discussion and Conclusions"}, {"text": "Most epidemic curves in the early stage of a novel disease outbreak have multiple phases or waves due to simple stochastic (\"random\") variation, mechanisms of disease importing, initial transmission networks and individual/community behavior changes, improvements in the performance of surveillance systems, or changes in case definitions as the outbreak response evolves.

In our current study, the hierarchical approach used by Canada's most populous province (Ontario) for replacement of missing data could have had distorting effects on measured disease epidemiology: the replacement of missing onset dates with dates of specimen collection could have resulted in the artifactual appearance of early turning points identified by our model, due to limitations in weekend staffing early in the outbreak. If, as we believe to be the case, public health laboratories did not have sufficient emergency staffing to keep up with testing on weekends such that weekend specimen log-ins declined sharply, this would have created the appearance of epidemic \"fade out\" on weekends. Other factors that might distort the apparent epidemiology of disease include changes in guidelines for laboratory testing of suspected cases, improved surveillance and public health alerts at later stages of the outbreak leading to increased case ascertainment or over-reporting of cases [20] .
