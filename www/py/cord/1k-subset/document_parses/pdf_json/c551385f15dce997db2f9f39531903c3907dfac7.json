Second, the measured R rs in our patients is lower than previously reported in mechanically ventilated infants with RSV LRTD designated to have an obstructive disease phenotype [20, 22, 27] . This could indicate that our patients had mild-to-moderate airway obstruction, although hyperinflation suggesting airway obstruction on chest radiograph was present in all but one patient. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for the radiological definition of hyperinflation especially in mechanically ventilated infants. Furthermore, the degree of air-trapping might vary between patients, indicating that severe RSV LRTD necessitating MV is a heterogeneous disease in which patients express to a varying degree both restrictive and obstructive disease characteristics explaining why some patients had a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of less than 200 or a C stat less than 0.3 ml/cmH 2 O/kg in our study. This assumption opposes the previously proposed dichotomization of RSV LRTD by Hammer and colleagues, who have observed that mechanically ventilated infants with RSV LRTD showed either a disease pattern compatible with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a disease pattern characterized by increased airway resistance [27] . Although our study was not designed to investigate differences in clinical phenotype, we would dare to challenge this dichotomy in clinical phenotype for several reasons. Hammer and colleagues included prematurely born infants with chronic lung disease and infants with congenital heart disease [27] . C rs is significantly lower in these patients compared with healthy infants [28] [29] [30] . In addition, the term 'bronchiolitis' to describe RSV LRTD is strictly speaking a histopathologic diagnosis and hampered by universal differences in its clinical interpretation [31] .

It should be mentioned, however, that our study population was probably more ill than theirs based on a higher T = 0 PaCO 2 and lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio.

Hinz and colleagues have shown that compared with the validated nitrogen-washout method it is an appropriate tool to study EELV in critically ill patients [16] . To our knowledge, the use of EIT in the determination of the dynamic process of air-trapping in patients with small airway disease has not been used before, although its use in this disease condition can be rationalised. In our study, MV with heliox did not result in a universal reduction of air-trapping as defined by the relative \u0394 EELV . However, there were some patients who seemed to benefit from MV with heliox as they did show a reduction in relative \u0394 EELV that was reversed by MV with conventional gas. Several explanations for the non-universal reduction in relative \u0394 EELV may be proposed. First, not all alveoli have the same degree of hyperinflation due to the difference in time constants throughout the lung, indicating that hyperinflation is a regional phenomenon rather than a global problem [36] . This would implicate that the technique of EIT may be insufficient to detect regional differences in viralinduced small airway disease due to heterogeneity of the disease, a problem that can be overcome by increasing the reso-lution of the EIT signal. In favor of EIT, however, is the study by Adler and colleagues showing that with EIT dynamic hyperinflation could be adequately monitored [37] . Second, during the study no endotracheal suctioning was performed. Increased mucus production could obstruct the airways, resulting in the collapse of alveoli that is reflected by a decrease in EELV. As tidal volume remained constant throughout the experiment, we think that not performing endotracheal suctioning did not influence our results ( Figure 5 ). Third, if there is a difference in expression of clinical phenotype of RSV LRTD a universal response in relative \u0394 EELV would not be expected. Some patients responded with a decrease in relative \u0394 EELV whereas others did not in our study. Also, redistribution of ventilation within each lung or between the left and right lung was not significantly influenced by MV with heliox. This is in line with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype of RSV LRTD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 145, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 303, "end": 307, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1124, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1521, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1870, "end": 1878, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Figure 5"}, {"text": "There are some limitations to our study that should be mentioned.

Third, the measurements of our study were not blinded because connection of the heliox and the measurements were conducted by one investigator (MK). However, this might have introduced measurement bias. Fourth, ventilation with heliox may have influenced the tidal volume measurements of the AVEA ventilator. The AVEA is equipped with the Bicore CP100\u2122 pulmonary mechanics monitor that has been validated previously [36, 39] .
