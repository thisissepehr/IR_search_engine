Activation of complement leads to a sequential cascade of enzymatic reactions (known as complement activation pathways; see below) resulting in the formation of the potent anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a that elicit a plethora of physiological responses that range from chemoattraction to apoptosis. Initially, complement was thought to play a major role in innate immunity where a robust and rapid response is mounted against invading pathogens. However, recently, it is becoming increasingly evident that complement also plays an important role in adaptive immunity involving T and B cells that help in elimination of pathogens (Dunkelberger and Song 2010; Molina et al. 1996) and in maintaining immunologic memory preventing pathogenic re-invasion. Not only is complement involved in innate and adaptive immunity but it is also involved in tissue regeneration, tumor growth (Qu et al. 2009 ) and human pathological states such a atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, age-related macular degeneration, etc. (Wagner and Frank 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 172, "text": "(Walport 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 962, "end": 990, "text": "(Dunkelberger and Song 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 991, "end": 1010, "text": "Molina et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1224, "text": "(Qu et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1362, "text": "(Wagner and Frank 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "C3 convertase C3bBb, which is stabilized by the presence of plasma properdin (Kemper et al. 2010) .

Under inflammatory conditions, expression of C5aR increases in lung endothelial, alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages Riedemann et al. 2002) .

Abundant expression of C5L2 has been found on neutrophils and dendritic cells (Ohno et al. 2000) . Unlike C3aR and C5aR, C5L2 is uncoupled from G-proteins due to an amino-acid replacement of arginine by leucine in the DRY region at the end of the third intra-cellular transmembrane loop (Cain and Monk 2002) . Following binding of C5a, C5L2 does not induce classical signaling (induction of intracellular calcium transients) or cause biological cellular responses. The role of C5L2 is largely unknown. It may act as a decoy or scavenger receptor for C5a (Okinaga et al. 2003; Scola et al. 2009 ).

C3a des-Arg, which is also known as acylationstimulating protein (ASP), is thought to induce triglyceride synthesis in adipocytes (Kalant et al. 2005) . C3b and C4b are also quickly inactivated by proteolytic cleavage into fragments iC3b, C3dg, C3c, C4c, C4d by the serine protease Factor I in the presence of cofactors: membrane cofactor protein (MCP) and complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) that are membrane bound and Factor H which is bound to host surfaces. CR1 promotes phagocytosis, helping to clear immune complexes by binding to C3b in immune complexes. Failure to clear these complexes leads to deposition of complexes in tissues and activation via Fc receptors, resulting in tissue injury. CR2 (CD21) binds iC3b, C3dg and C3d (Holers and Kulik 2007) . Further-more, C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) inactivates C1r, C1s and MASP2 (Davis et al. 2008) . Complement activation is also regulated either by preventing the assembly of the C3 convertase or, once it is formed, by inhibiting its activity due to actions of decay acceleration factor (DAF, CD55), C4 binding protein (C4BP), Factor H and a membranebound protein found only in rodents, Crry.

Interestingly, C5 deficiency or intercepting C5a and C5aR interaction has a protective effect in an animal model of cerebral malaria (Patel et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 466, "end": 485, "text": "(Zipfel et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 773, "end": 792, "text": "Silver et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 928, "end": 947, "text": "(Patel et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Consequences of dysregulated complement activation"}, {"text": "Asthma and the acute response distress syndrome (ARDS) are two of the more well-known examples of dysregulated complement activation. It is now well established from both experimental models of sepsis and clinical studies in humans that the complement system plays a key role in the pathophysiology of asthma and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (reviewed in Wills-Karp 2007; Sarma et al. 2006) . Asthma is a chronic inflammatory upper airway disease with increasing prevalence throughout the world and especially in young children in the developed world. In asthma, hyper-secretion of mucus occurs in the airways along with smooth muscle proliferation in upper airway (bronchial/bronchiolar) walls together with increased numbers of mast cells, CD4+ T cells and eosinophils. This leads to obstructed airways and accentuated upper airway contractile responses leading to shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing. In ARDS, there is a severe impairment of gas exchange due to damage to the alveolar and vascular epithelium resulting in increased permeability of plasma contents and influx of neutrophils into the interstitial and alveolar spaces.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 382, "text": "Wills-Karp 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 383, "end": 401, "text": "Sarma et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Consequences of dysregulated complement activation"}, {"text": "Clinical studies show that elevated levels of C3a and C5a occur in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of individuals with asthma and ARDS when compared to healthy individuals (Wills-Karp 2007) . Elevated levels of C3a and C5a may also be found in the serum of ARDS patients. Similarly, in septic patients, elevated levels of the MAC complex precede the development of ARDS (Langlois and Gawryl 1988). There is substantial evidence suggesting that varied environmental factors trigger complement activation at the airway interface, leading to recruitment of cells that release inflammatory mediators resulting in further exacerbation of the inflammatory process in asthma and ARDS (Wills-Karp 2007) . For example, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1 generated from inflammatory cells induce up-regulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and E-selectin) on vascular endothelial cells and in pulmonary epithelial cells, which results in tethering of neutrophils to these surfaces. Neutrophils can exert further tissue damage by releasing myeloperoxidase, elastase, etc. Examples of environmental triggers that activate complement are seen in elevated BAL C3 levels in humans exposed to ozone, and elevated serum C3 levels in children with chronic exposure to cigarette smoke. It has been suggested that proteases released from infiltrating cells into the airways can directly cleave C3 and C5, thereby generating C3a and C5a. Alternatively, antibodycontaining immune complexes as well as carbohydrate moieties and macromolecular structures present on pathogens and allergens can activate all three complement pathways. It is likely that complement gets activated by a number of different pathways in asthma and ARDS, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 193, "text": "(Wills-Karp 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 681, "end": 698, "text": "(Wills-Karp 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Consequences of dysregulated complement activation"}, {"text": "Thus, given above are a few examples of the pathology of dysregulated complement activation.

Understanding subversion tactics of pathogens can help in designing therapeutic interventions when unwanted or runaway complement activation does more harm than good. It has been a challenge to design effective therapeutic interventions, although a number of soluble and membrane-bound complement proteins are available as potential therapeutic targets. One of the main problems is the lack of understanding of the exact molecular mechanisms involved in complement-mediated disease pathology (reviewed in Ricklin and Lambris 2007) . For instance, a good example is the use of compstatin, a synthetic compound that blocks the C3 convertase. An ideal use of compstatin would be for treatment of patients experiencing age-related macular degeneration, using intravitreal injection into the eye, much as is now done with blocking mAb to VEGF. On the other hand, systemic treatment of septic patients with compstatin runs the risk of excessive blocking of the C3 convertase, which would compromise the production of the vital opsonic factors, C3b and iC3b. Accordingly, this presents the dilemma for using complement inhibitors that target the C3 convertase. The lack of sufficient knowledge about details of complement activation (including the complement regulatory proteins) makes it difficult to predict the efficacy of complement inhibitors that would be given systemically.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 204, "text": "(Ricklin and Lambris 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 712, "end": 737, "text": "Ricklin and Lambris 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Complement-based therapeutics"}, {"text": "Another example of a dilemma related to in vivo blockade of complement comes from recent studies involving mice with CLP-induced sepsis (Flierl et al. 2008 ).
