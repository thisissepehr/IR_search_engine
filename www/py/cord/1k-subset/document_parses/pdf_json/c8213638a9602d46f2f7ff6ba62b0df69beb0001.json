An influenza pandemic is considered increasingly likely, and is now considered one of the most significant and urgent threats to the nation's public health preparedness infrastructure. It has been argued that of the 12 disaster scenarios recently assessed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, pandemic influenza is the most likely and perhaps the most deadly [1] . The United States pandemic influenza plan released in November 2005, lays out a critical role for local and state public health agencies during a pandemic, including: providing regular situational updates for providers; providing guidance on infection control measures for healthcare and non-healthcare settings; conducting or facilitating testing and investigation of pandemic influenza cases; and investigating and reporting special pandemic situations [2] . These specified activities would require an extensive prompt response by local health departments. Current contingency plans account for possible personnel shortages due to influenza morbidity, but previous studies have shown that during extreme scenarios, a varying proportion of healthcare workers may be unable or unwilling to report to duty [3] [4] [5] . This may be even truer for health departments, where unlike more \"traditional\" first responder agencies (such as law enforcement, fire services, and emergency medical services), the capacity and willingness to respond 24/7 to crises is not historically ingrained in the workforces' professional cultures and training. Even in the post-9/11 environment, recent data indicate inconsistent and sometimes slow after-hours response by health departments to urgent events involving communicable disease [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 498, "end": 501, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 959, "end": 962, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1313, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1317, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1321, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1824, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Risk perception theory provides a revealing framework for better understanding response limitations and needs of the public health workforce.
