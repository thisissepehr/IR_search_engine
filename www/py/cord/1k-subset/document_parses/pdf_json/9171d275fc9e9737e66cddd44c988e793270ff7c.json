Despite extensive research still we do not quite understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are involved in triggering and propagation of septic injury. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria, or LPS) has been implicated as a major cause of this syndrome. Inflammatory shock as a consequence of LPS release remains a serious clinical concern. In humans, inflammatory responses to LPS result in the release of cytokines and other cell mediators from monocytes and macrophages, which can cause fever, shock, organ failure and death. A number of different approaches have been investigated to try to treat and/or prevent the septic shock associated with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including blockage of one or more of the cytokines induced by LPS. Recently several novel amphipathic compounds have been developed as direct LPS antagonists at the LPS receptor, TLR4. This review article will outline the current knowledge on the TLR4-LPS synthesis and discuss the signaling, in vitro pre-clinical and in vivo clinical evaluation of TLR4 antagonists and their potential use in sepsis and a variety of diseases such as atherosclerosis as well as hepatic and renal malfunction.",

Ten members of the TLR family have been identified in humans (7) . The Toll was originally described as a type I transmembrane receptor that controls the embryonic dorsal-ventral pattern of Drosophila (8) . In fact this pioneering work identified a group of ten different genes which when deleted produced qualitatively similar phenotypes. Null mutations on any of these genes lead to a failure to differentiate patterns on the dorsoventral axis and resulted on embryonic lethality. The identification of the sequence of Toll led to the recognition that its carboxyl terminal domain was significantly related to that of the vertebrate interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) (8) . IL-1R activation is part of a cascade of events linked to an acute phase response to infection. This suggested that TLRs could not only be involved in development but also in the initial responses to infection in vertebrates. This hypothesis received further support from the work of Lemaitre et al., who found that Toll and other genes from the dorsal group played a role in innate immune responses to pathogenic fungi and bacteria (9) .",

The three subgroups are: the IL-1R (which present extracellular immunoglobulin domains), the adapter subgroup (cytoplasmic proteins without extracellular region) and the TLRs (9) . TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins with extracellular amino terminus and a carboxy terminal intracellular domain. The extracellular domain of the TLR4 contains over 600 amino acids and is highly polymorphic compared with the transmembrane and cytosolic domains (6) . The TIR domain, composed of three highly conserved regions, contains 150 amino acids and modulates protein-protein interactions between the TLRs and the adaptor proteins involved in the signal transduction cascade (10) . Unlike other receptors, TLRs do not have an enzymatic activity (6) . Researchers have identified at least fifteen different negative regulators of the TLRs, including MyD88s (a short form of MyD88), IRAKM, suppressor of cell signaling-1 (SOCS1), nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) (11) . The TLR activation leads to responses that involve the induction of new genes via transduction pathways such as NF\u03baB and AP-1 (9) . The discovery of TLR lead to the understanding that an adaptive response mediated by antibody responses and T cell activation is tightly coupled to a second unknown process that requires the presence of microbial extracts (2, 7) .",

TLR signaling involves a family of adaptor proteins which recruit downstream protein kinases which activate transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kB (NF-\u03baB) and members of the interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor (IRF) family (10) . LPS signaling involves the binding of the LPS-binding protein (LBP) to LPS; this interaction leads to a disruption of LPS aggregates (10) (Fig. 2 LPS signaling, modified from (10) with permission). Upon ligand binding there is the formation of a TLR4 complex with CD14. CD14 was the first molecule shown to enhance LPS signals (17) . Interestingly TLR4 does not require CD14 to trigger epithelial signaling to uropathogenic E. coli since bladder cells do not express CD14 (18) . In addition a small molecule, myeloid differentiation 2 receptor (MD-2), participates in this complex by associating with the TLR4 extracellular domain (19) .",

Association of the MD-2:LPS complex to the ectodomain of the TLR4 finally transduces the signal through the association of intracellular TIR domain, recruiting the adapter proteins triggering the signaling cascade (20) . In a similar way to TLR2, TLR4 uses the myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 adapter like protein (MAL) as a bridging adaptor to recruit the myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MyD88) to activate the NF-\u03baB, p38 and JNK/MAPK pathways via TRAF6 (9) . MAL is recruited to plasma membrane microdomains containing the phospholipid PtdIns (4,5)P 2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate). MAL subsequently recruits MyD88 (20) . Another pathway activated by TLR4 involves TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). Similar to MAL, TRAM is also membrane proximal and requires myristoylation to lodge into the membrane. TRAM recruits the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon\u03b2 (TRIF) which activates the tumor-necrosis factor-receptorassociated factor 3 (TRAF3), TRAF6 and receptor interacting protein 1(RIP1). Recent work with CD14 knockout mice suggested that TRL4 can function in two ways: one where full signaling occurs in the presence of CD14 and one limited to MyD88-dependent signaling (21) .",

In the early atherosclerotic lesion, LPS and other ligands can stimulate the TLR4 expression on macrophages. The activated receptors can then initiate the signaling cascade that induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and cytotoxic oxygen and nitrogen radicals. These entities further speed up the progression of the atherosclerotic lesion (34) . In advanced atherosclerotic lesion, LPS can induce the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as the expression of elastin-degrading enzyme via TLR4 (35) . Besides that, in response to chemokines, more smooth muscle cells will also migrate to the sites of the lesions (36).

An inflammatory response triggered by MI/R injury can irreversibly cause damage to the viable tissue surrounding the infarct, thereby further extending the injury. It is still unclear how innate immune signaling pathways are initiated during MI/R injury (43) . However, TLR4, which is also present in cardiomyocytes, has been thought to play a role in mediating MI/R injury. Schuster and Nelson (28) have shown that TLR4 receptor is up-regulated in response to myocardial injury. Furthermore, Shimamoto and colleagues have shown that TLR4 activates NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes in MI/R injury. The TLR4-mediated injury appears to occur through activation of c-Jun NH 2terminal kinase (JNK) and translocation of NF-\u03baB (41) . It is also believed that TLR4 recognizes endogenous molecules that are exposed during cellular injury and extracellular matrix remodeling, independent of pathogen invasion (44) . Thus, inhibition of TLR4 signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target to treat the myocardium damage in the ischemia/reperfusion setting.",

E5564 also blocked the ability of Gram negative bacteria to stimulate human cytokine production in whole blood. In vivo, E5564 blocked induction of LPS-induced cytokines and LPS or bacterial-induced lethality in primed mice. E5564 was devoid of agonistic activity when tested both in vitro and in vivo and had no antagonistic activity against Gram positive-mediated cellular activation at concentrations up to 1 \u03bcM. E5564 blocked LPS-mediated activation of nuclear factor-B in TLR4/MD-2transfected cells. In a mouse macrophage cell line, activity of E5564 was independent of serum, suggesting that E5564 exerts its activity through the cell surface receptor(s) for LPS, without the need for serum LPS transfer proteins. Similar to E5531, another lipid A-like antagonist, E5564 associates with plasma lipoproteins, causing low concentrations of E5564 to be quantitatively inactivated in a dose-and time-dependent manner. However, compared with E5531, E5564 is a more potent inhibitor of cytokine generation, and higher doses retain activity for a period of time likely sufficient to permit clinical application. These results indicate that E5564 is a potent LPS antagonist and lacks agonistic activity in human and animal model systems, making it a potentially effective therapeutic agent for treatment of disease states caused by LPS. Compared with E5531, E5564 is structurally and synthetically less complex, yet seems to possess superior activity and pharmacological characteristics. Although E5531 demonstrated potent inhibition of LPS when added to blood in vitro and in vivo, activity decreased as a function of time. This reaction has been shown to be due to interaction of E5531 with plasma lipoproteins (58) (59) (60) . E5564 is an inhibitor of LPS-mediated stimulation of responsive cells in vitro and in vivo as measured by production of cytokines, as well as morbidity and mortality associated with LPS poisoning in animal models. Because E5564 is a structural analog of the lipid A portion of LPS, it is logical to hypothesize that the antagonist interacts with the same signaling components that bind to LPS such as the soluble serum proteins LBP and sCD14, as well as membrane-associated CD14 and perhaps the TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex. E5564 blocked LPS/ sCD14-induced reporter activity in TLR4/MD-2-expressing HEK293 (61), but not TLR2-mediated signaling by heatkilled S. aureus. These findings indicate that E5564 selectively inhibits LPS signaling via TLR4/MD-2. However, a limitation to this model system is that LPS requires the presence of sCD14 for cellular activation, making it difficult to determine whether E5564 blocks LPS binding to sCD14 or TLR4/MD-2.",

E5564 inhibited the actions of these agonists under serum-free conditions. Taken together, these lines of evidence make it tempting to speculate that E5564 binds to TLR4/MD-2 complex, thereby blocking LPS binding or transmembrane signaling. The downstream effect of inhibiting the initial signaling by LPS seems to be an inhibition of all LPS-induced cytokines measured, including TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and nitric oxide, which was measured in cultured cells, whole blood, and in vivo. Recently the crystal structure of the TLR4/MD-2 and E5564 has been described confirming the physical interaction of these molecules (57) .",

The primed model is the most relevant to the study of endotoxin antagonists such as E5564. It is well known that compared with humans, unprimed rodents such as rats and mice and primates demonstrate a profound insensitivity to endotoxin, requiring endotoxin doses as high as milligrams per kilogram, whereas humans demonstrate reproducible response to endotoxin at doses as low as 2 ng/kg.

Many of these target specific inflammatory mediators have been unsuccessful because of the complex nature of sepsis.

Eli Lilly's Xigris \u00ae was one of the few drugs currently available on the market to treat sepsis.

In addition, simvastatin and atorvastatin had also shown to have some non-specific anti-inflammatory effects contributing to their clinical benefits in treating sepsis (63) . However, statins are currently not been considered as a treatment for sepsis.

This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential-group, singledose study of E5564. The drug dose levels used were 350, 1,000, 2,000 or 3,500 \u03bcg. All doses of E5564 presented a long pharmacokinetic half-life and short in vivo pharmacodynamic half life which generally less than several hours when it is coadministered with LPS in healthy volunteers (74) . The C max and AUC (area under the curve) of E5564 increased in a dose-dependent manner. E5564 pharmacokinetics was characterized by a slow clearance (0.67-0.95 ml h \u22121 kg \u22121 ), a small volume of distribution (41-54 ml/kg), and a relatively long elimination half life (42-51 h) in healthy male volunteers. Thus, to overcome this low PD, the doses of E5564 given to the volunteers needed to be adjusted. In summary, all doses were demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated. Safety and tolerability assessments included monitoring and questioning of the subjects about adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), and vital sign measurements (including supine and standing pulse rate and blood pressure), and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and cytokine concentration testing. In this study, E5564 inhibited LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in a dose-dependent manner, and at the higher doses (2 and 3.5 mg), antagonistic activity was measurable up to 8 h post-infusion. E5564 lacked LPS-like agonist activity at doses up to 3.5 mg (74).",

(66) found phlebitis was only associated with 72 h continuous intravenous infusion of E5564 but not with four hour infusion of E5564 into a peripheral vein. In this study the authors explored the possibility of extended pharmacokinetic activity of E5564. The infusion period was changed from bulk dosing to a 4-and 72-h infusions of E5564 into normal volunteers. They observed that at 4 h infusion of E5564, 3 mg/h completely blocked endotoxin administered 8 h post-dosing. Additionally, they observed that administration of 3.4 mg of E5564/hX72 h completely blocked the effects of endotoxin challenge at the end of dosing (72 h), and at 48 and 72 h post dosing. A lower dose of E5564 of 2 mg was also studied, and they found that 0.5 mg/h\u00d74 h, ameliorated but did not block most effects of endotoxin 8 h post-dosing. This work also studied the effect of varying plasma lipoprotein content on E5564 activity in subjects who have high or low cholesterol levels (>180 or <140 mg/dl) after a 72 h infusion of 252 mg of E5564. The distribution of E5564 into the lipoprotein fractions was not significantly different between the low-and highcholesterol groups (66) .",
