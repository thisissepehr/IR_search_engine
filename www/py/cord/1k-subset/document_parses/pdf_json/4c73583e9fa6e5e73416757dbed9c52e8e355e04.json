The Mexican government responded on 24 April 2009, closing schools, canceling public gatherings in Mexico City and surrounding states until 6 May 2009 [4] .

The pandemics of 1948, 1957 and 1968 were caused by variations of the infl uenza virus resulting from this shuffl ing of the eight gene pairs within the virus. Infl uenza pandemics occur in three waves. The typical fi rst wave or initial outbreak, as in the spring of 1918, was relatively mild, starting from the Midwest and spreading along the rail lines with soldiers from Ft. Funston, Kansas, modern day Ft. Riley [2, 3, 14, 16] . The novel H1N1 discovered in Mexico also had such a humble origin. Both patient zeros reported little problems and made complete recoveries. Unlike the Mexican outbreak, the 1918 spring outbreak was not even noted in the index in the 1918 volumes of the Journals of the American Medical Association. Infl uenza was not a reportable disease until 1925 in the United States: the only evidence of the early occurrence was the registration of deaths reported as uncomplicated cases of pneumonia by physicians to various public health departments [3, 8, 9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 327, "end": 331, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 751, "end": 754, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 755, "end": 757, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 758, "end": 761, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 762, "end": 765, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1313, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1316, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1319, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A pandemic"}, {"text": "Those who had suffered from the earlier spring infl uenza generally suffered less discomfort in the second wave which would occur in the early summer of 1918 in Europe, affecting the outcome of the war. The third and most deadly wave of the infl uenza would occur later that year in the late fall. Despite the obvious differences between the strains in each wave, it is suggested that the more virulent form of infl uenza was genetically derived from the spring infl uenza [3, 10, 12] . The antigenic composition of the 1918 virus is related to the H1N1 viral group. Phylogenetic studies indicate that the virus responsible for the 1918 infl uenza and viruses that provided gene segments for the Asian/1957 and Hong Kong/1968 pandemics are still circulating in wild birds, with few or no mutations [10,11,16,] . The extreme virulence of fall 1918 infl uenza strain has been blamed on severe pathology with acute pulmonary edema, as well as hemorrhage with acute bronchiolitis, aveolitis and bronchopneumonia [20] it is believed that the severe infl ammation of the lungs initiated high levels of cytokines resulting in a depletion of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, causing death. The stronger the host's immune system, the stronger response to the infl uenza infection, and greater release of cytokines to counter the virus [19, 20] . This is what resulted in the much higher than average mortality among the 15-40-year-old cohort. Patterson and Pyle [12] , Crosby [8] and many other researchers believe that a strain of pneumonia bacteria accompanied the virus [3, 12] . Noyes [3, 14, 17] noted that the nation's people were stricken and died from the illness at differing rates, just as the cities were hit at differing rates. There was no correlation between populations, or even geographical demographics. Sex and age both played a major factor in determining the susceptibility to the disease of the individual. Females were stricken in rates greater than males, and young adults were sickened in greater numbers that other age cohorts [3, 13 and 14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 473, "end": 476, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 477, "end": 480, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 481, "end": 484, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 798, "end": 809, "text": "[10,11,16,]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1012, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1335, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1339, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1462, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1475, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1572, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1576, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1588, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1592, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1596, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2048, "end": 2062, "text": "[3, 13 and 14]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A pandemic"}, {"text": "The current international strain of novel H1N1 virus discovered in Mexico is derived from two unrelated swine viruses, one associated with a fourth generation of the 1918 human infl uenza virus with which acts to recombine the viruses and its progeny [4, 18] . Essentially the virus continues by shuffl ing its eight genes in the avian reservoir to eventually be passed to swine and other mammals before the encounter with humans. Seldom are there transfer of infl uenza between humans and avian. Pigs act as the \"transformers or converters\" for the various infl uenza viruses and let loose the world new \"strains\" of the infl uenza virus. The intervening passage continues to be through the domesticated pig, as they have the mechanism to convert the arrangement of the sialic acids to become receptive to human cells [21, 22] . The arrangement of the genes, determine the protein sheath structure and the interaction between the antibody defenses of the host. A mere change of one amino acid can change the impact of the infection, from a mild discomfort to a killer virus [14] .

Because of the war, information concerning the infl uenza was blocked, except for neutral Spain, which won the honor of being the name sake for this deadly virus: \"The Spanish Infl uenza\". In Britain, the battle between preventive and curative medicine raged. Previously these medical approaches were championed by the Medical Offi cers of Health in their efforts to prevent illness, and a therapeutic practice by private physicians [1] . The curative physicians, primarily general practitioners, were overwhelmed by the cases of infl uenza and relied on traditional methods to cope with the illness ranging from aspirin, quinine, opium, ammonia, alcohol, camphor, eucalyptus and iodine to musk, wet packs, blood serum, creosote, turpentine, cinnamon and turtle soup [1, 2] . At best, these prescriptions offered symptomatic relief, and some actually harmed the patients. In the United States, the 1918 pandemic was met with local quarantines, and large public gatherings were discouraged, and like Great Britain folk remedies were widely used [2, 8, 22] . There was no coordinated information from medical authorities to the communities on how to cope with this outbreak.

Vaccination is the best defense against the infl uenza if the right strain is predicted, and if there are no mutations after the administration of the vaccine. In the 1957 and 1968, infl uenza vaccination programs were credited with the reduction of the severity of both pandemics. The 1976 swine fl u scare provided the general public a forum to exam the role of vaccination, when the \"predicted\" swine fl u pandemic failed to materialize after hundreds of thousands of Americans were vaccinated [15] . As shared by many authorities, the directions of pandemics are diffi cult to predict. Successive pandemics and pandemiclike episodes have been decreasing in severity over time. This is due to advances in medicine, public health and understanding the genetics of the disease, but this may also refl ect the evolutionary course of the virus, to that favors transmissibility with minimal pathogenicity. A virus that kills its host, or causes its host to remain at home, will not be transmitted [10] .
