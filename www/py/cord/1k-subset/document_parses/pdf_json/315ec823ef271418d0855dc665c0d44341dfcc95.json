It is well accepted that a breakdown of the normally impermeant epithelial barrier of the intestine, the lung, and the kidney is associated with the development of inflammatory disease in these organs, yet significant controversy exists as to how this breakdown actually occurs, and how such a breakdown may lead to inflammation. In this regard, much work has focused upon the role of the epithelium as an \"innocent bystander,\" a target of a leukocyte-mediated inflammatory cascade that leads to its destruction in the mucosal inflammatory process. However, recent evidence from a variety of laboratories indicates that the epithelium is not merely a passive component in the steps that lead to mucosal inflammation, but is a central participant in the process. In addressing this controversy, we and others have determined that epithelial cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, and that activation of TLRs by endogenous and exogenous ligands may play a central role in determining the balance between a state of \"mucosal homeostasis,\" as is required for optimal organ function, and \"mucosal injury,\" leading to mucosal inflammation and barrier breakdown. In particular, activation of TLRs within intestinal epithelial cells leads to the development of cellular injury and impairment in mucosal repair in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, while activation of TLRs in the lung and kidney may participate in the development of pneumonitis and nephritis respectively. Recent work in support of these concepts is extensively reviewed, while essential areas of further study that are required to determine the significance of epithelial TLR signaling during states of health and disease are outlined.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Standing at the interface between the host and the environment, mucosal-lined surfaces represent the first line of defense against potential pathogens. This defensive role is particularly relevant to the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, the pulmonary system, and the urinary tract, each of which is particularly susceptible to the development of inflammatory diseases due to their role as a barrier that must not only protect, but also serve the physiological function of each of the organ systems. In the case of the gastrointestinal tract, mucosal inflammation is manifest as inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) (1) (2) (3) or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a leading cause of death in preterm infants (4) . In the case of the pulmonary system, mucosal inflammation may be manifest as pneumonitis, pneumonia, or asthma (5-7), acute and chronic pulmonary conditions that have a high degree of morbidity and potential mortality. And in the case of the urinary tract, mucosal inflammation may be manifest as interstitial nephritis, cystitis, and urethritis (8) (9) (10) , causes of significant morbidity in patients of all ages. To elucidate the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammatory diseases, research over the past several decades has focused on the role of the immune system in their developmentin particular the relationship between mucosal lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, and the effects of their cellular by-products on mucosal integrity and function (11) (12) (13) . However, recent work has shed light upon the important role that the epithelia itself may play as a primary regulator of the immune response in the development of mucosal inflammation. No longer an innocent bystander, the epithelial-lined mucosa at each of these sites has been shown to possess all of the required armamentarium to allow an effective response to invading challenges, and to lead the battle to neutralize potential microbial threats (14) (15) (16) . Not only is the epithelium able to respond to potentially dangerous microbial products, it also may sense endogenous molecules that are released during conditions of stress, hypoxia, or injury-so-called danger molecules that may play a critical role in the development of mucosal inflammation (17) (18) (19) . In order, therefore, to understand the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation and to assist in the rational design of anti-inflammatory strategies, it is necessary to define the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate the inflam-matory response with respect to the epithelium itself. The innate immune system consists of a series of receptors and their associated signaling molecules that is present both on leukocytes and epithelial cells through the body, and which initiates an immune response by responding directly to pre-formed ligands ( [20] provides a recent review). The innate immune system lies in contradistinction to the adaptive immune system, a set of cellular and molecular interactions that must first \"learn\" how to deal with a potential pathogen, and then respond through the release of antibodies or other cellular derived products. The innate immune system includes pattern recognition receptors such as the TLRs, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), the RIG-like receptors (RLRs), and C-type lectins, and their role in inflammatory signaling in leukocytes has been extensively reviewed (21) (22) (23) 186) . Relatively few reports have focused on the ability of the innate immune system to signal within the epithelium, although emerging evidence from a variety of laboratories including our own indicates that innate immune signaling within the epithelium plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation. The current review will focus on the TLR family, which has been shown to play a critical role in the response of epithelial cells to bacterial and endogenous ligands in the pathogenesis of various mucosal inflammatory diseases (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 661, "end": 664, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 665, "end": 668, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 669, "end": 672, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 753, "end": 756, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1108, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1112, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1117, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1519, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1524, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1529, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1985, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1990, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1995, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2295, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2300, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2301, "end": 2305, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2856, "end": 2860, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3414, "end": 3418, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3419, "end": 3423, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3424, "end": 3428, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3429, "end": 3433, "text": "186)", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3979, "end": 3988, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "THE CLINICAL AND SCIENTIFIC IMPORTANCE OF MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION"}, {"text": "A central controversy in the field of mucosal inflammation may be stated as follows (Figure 1 provides a pictorial representation of this): Is mucosal inflammation a reflection of a leukocyte-driven immune response that has gone awry, resulting in tissue injury and the loss of mucosal barrier function ( Figure 1A )?

Such ligands may be broadly grouped into two categories: the so called \"danger signals,\" a term used by Matzinger (24) , also called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) ( [25, 26] provide recent reviews); and those ligands on the surface or interior of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) ( Table 2) . Not surprisingly, there is a great deal of interest in identifying the important receptors for DAMPs and PAMPs expressed by various cell types, so as to accurately define their relative role in the development of inflammation. In this regard, several investigators have established that DAMPs and PAMPs are recognized by TLRs in many cells, including epithelial cells: a list of the TLRs and their cognate ligands appears in Table 1 . Although current dogma suggests that circulating leukocytes play a central role in the coordination of the immune response, emerging evidence suggests that the epithelium also plays a key role in the recognition and response to various \"danger molecules\" (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) .

All currently recognized TLRs are homologous with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor, sharing an intracellular signaling domain, known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain (36) . A model that depicts the currently accepted mode of TLR signaling in leuko-cytes is shown in Figure 2 , in which the interaction with TLR4 and its cognate ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is shown. The interaction of TLR4 with LPS leads to the activation of myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent signaling, resulting in the induction of pro-inflammatory genes such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 (37-39) and MyD88-independent signaling cascades leading to activation of type-1 interferon (40 has a recent review) (38, 41) . MyD88-depedent signaling occurs as TIR domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP/Mal) (42, 43) and MyD88 (44) (45) (46) interact with TLR4 and recruit IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family members IRAK1 and IRAK4 to the signaling heterocomplex consisting of TLR4, MyD88, and TIRAP (46) . Subsequent signaling occurs through tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)mediated (47) activation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) (48) . TAK1 forms a complex with TAK1 binding proteins (TAB), TAB1 (49), TAB2 (50) , and TAB3 (51) . The TAK1/ TAB1/TAB2/TAB3 complex formation leads to the phosphorylation of I\u03baB by I\u03baB kinase (I\u03baK) (52), initiating nuclear factorkappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways and parallel activation of several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP-kinases) including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (154) Viral proteins (106,143) Self DNA (155) Flagellin (58) Uric Acid (156) Bacterial DNA (148) Profilin (149) (53), p38 MAP-kinase (54) , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (55), ultimately resulting in pro-inflammatory gene induction (56, 57) . It is noteworthy that MyD88-dependent signaling is thought to be the predominant signaling pathway for TLR2 (41) , TLR5 (58), TLR7 (59) , and TLR9 (60,61). Figure 2 , TLR4 also may signal in the absence of MyD88. Evidence for this was demonstrated by Kawai et al., who described that the activation of NF-\u03baB and MAP-kinases was reduced significantly, but not abolished, in MyD88-deficient mice (38) . The MyD88-independent signaling pathway proximally involves the activation of TRAM, a TIR-domain containing adapter molecule. TRAM associates with and activates TRIF, another TIR-domain containing adapter protein (62, 63) . TRIF then interacts with and activates TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK\u03b5, two I\u03baK homologs, which leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3 (64, 65) and translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of various genes, including the type I IFN family of genes (66) . TRIF also interacts with TRAF6 and receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP), leading to the activation of NF-\u03baB (67, 68) . Importantly, TLR3 signals mainly through the MyD88-independent, TRIFdependent pathway (62) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 276, "text": "(36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 836, "end": 840, "text": "(38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 841, "end": 844, "text": "41)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 932, "end": 936, "text": "(42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "43)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "(44)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 956, "end": 960, "text": "(45)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 961, "end": 965, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1139, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1331, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1409, "text": "(50)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1425, "text": "(51)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1721, "text": "(154)", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1761, "text": "(155)", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1792, "text": "(156)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1827, "text": "(149)", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1849, "end": 1853, "text": "(54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1966, "end": 1970, "text": "(56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1974, "text": "57)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2085, "end": 2089, "text": "(41)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2108, "end": 2112, "text": "(59)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2371, "end": 2375, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2591, "end": 2595, "text": "(62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2596, "end": 2599, "text": "63)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2740, "end": 2744, "text": "(64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2745, "end": 2748, "text": "65)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2883, "end": 2887, "text": "(66)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2998, "end": 3002, "text": "(67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 3003, "end": 3006, "text": "68)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 3095, "end": 3099, "text": "(62)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 372, "end": 380, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2141, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "RECOGNIZING DANGER: TLRS AND FRIENDS"}, {"text": "There is a wide and diverse spectrum of diseases that involves the development of inflammation of the intestinal mucosa.

NEC is the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in preterm infants (71) , and, currently, is one of the leading causes of death of newborns in the United States overall with a mortality rate of nearly 15% (82) . We have established recently that enterocyte TLR4 activation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of NEC (32) . Specifically, we found that NEC in both mice and humans is associated with increased expression of TLR4 in the intestinal mucosa, and that physiological stressors associated with NEC development, namely exposure to LPS and hypoxia, sensitize the murine intestinal epithe-lium to LPS through upregulation of TLR4 (32) . In support of a critical role for TLR4 in the development of NEC, TLR4-mutant C3H/HeJ mice were protected from the development of NEC compared with wild-type C3H/HeOUJ littermates (32), a finding consistent with previous work by Caplan et al. (33) . TLR4 activation in vitro led to increased enterocyte injury by induction of enterocyte apoptosis and reduced epithelial healing, due to an inhibition of enterocyte migration and proliferation. This latter finding suggests a role for enterocyte TLR4 in the regulation of intestinal mucosal repair. In support of this possibility, increased NEC severity in wildtype C3H/HeOUJ mice resulted from increased enterocyte apoptosis and reduced enterocyte restitution and proliferation compared with TLR4-mutant mice. TLR4 signaling also led to increased serine-phosphorylation of intestinal focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a molecule necessary for efficient enterocyte migration. Surprisingly, TLR4 coimmunoprecipitated with FAK in enterocytes, and siRNA-mediated FAK inhibition restored enterocyte migration after TLR4 activation, demonstrating that the FAK-TLR4 association regulates intestinal healing.

We recently have shown that enterocyte TLR4 plays a key role in regulating the ability of enterocytes to internalize Gram-negative bacteria into membrane-bound phagosomes. Further evidence that TLR4 signaling is both necessary and sufficient for phagocytosis by epithelial cells was found as cultured enterocytes were able to internalize LPS-coated but not uncoated latex particles, and MD2/TLR4-transfected HEK-293 cells acquired the capacity to internalize E. coli, whereas non-transfected HEK-293 and HEK-293 transfected with dominant negative TLR4 bearing a P712H mutation did not. Strikingly, the internalization of Gram-negative bacteria into enterocytes in vivo and the translocation of bacteria across the intestinal epithelium to mesenteric lymph nodes were significantly greater in wild-type mice as compared with mice with mutations in TLR4 (27) .

However, subsequent studies have demonstrated that TLR4 may play a permissive role in the development of spontaneous colonic inflammation (86) , suggesting either that the net effects of TLR4 on intestinal inflammation are dependent on the specific disease process examined, the anatomic location of the disease process, or that the interaction with various downstream effectors influences the extent of intestinal inflammation that develops. It is noteworthy that the inflammation observed in NEC is predominantly localized to the small intestine as opposed to the colon (4,87), implying that the effects of TLR4 activation within small intestinal epithelial cells may lead to different effects than its role on the colonic epithelia. In support of this concept, it has been demonstrated previously that small intestinal enterocytes are more responsive to LPS than colonic enterocytes, due in part to differences in TLR4 expression and/or activity (88, 89) . Moreover, the increase in expression of TLR4 within the ileum that we have observed after exposure to hypoxia and endotoxin suggests that TLR4dependent signaling within the small bowel mucosa may be increased after exposure to these stressors. The combined effects of the enhanced baseline sensitivity of the small intestine to LPS, and the upregulation of TLR4 expression in the intestine may partially explain the observed effects of enterocyte TLR4 in the induction of NEC.

Previous authors have shown that the pulmonary epithelium expresses a variety of TLRs (see Table 3 ), suggesting their role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation.

Furthermore, using MyD88-/bone marrow chimeras, Noulin et al. demonstrated that both resident and hematopoietic cells are necessary for the mucosal inflammatory response to inhaled endotoxin (28). Hajjar et al. demonstrated that MyD88-deficient mice transplanted with bone marrow from MyD88-expressing mice showed reduced chemokine production compared with MyD88 expressing mice that were transplanted with MyD88-expressing bone marrow in a model of experimental Pseudomonas aerogeninosa pneumonia, indicating a requirement for resident pulmonary parenchymal cells in the response to experimental pneumonia. The local pulmonary cytokine response was predominately dependent on competent MyD88 signaling in bone-marrow derived cells, suggesting that collaboration between local parenchymal cells, including epithelial cells, and bone-marrow derived cells is required (29) .

Such an antiinflammatory approach may have particular relevance in the case of epithelial inflammation, due to ready access of the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and urinary mucosa through ingestion, inhalation, or instillation via catheter delivery methods. Considerable attention has been placed on developing agents that are capable of modulation of the TLR4mediated response, in particular through manipulation of the lipid A moiety of LPS. Such lipid A mimetics, termed aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates (AGPs), have been demonstrated to reduce inflammation in experimental models of systemic sepsis induced by intravenous injection of Listeria monocytogenes (116) , pulmonary infection after intranasal administration of influenza virus (116) , murine models of colitis including DSS-induced colitis (117) , and spontaneous colitis in multidrug resistance gene 1a-deficient mice (117) . In parallel studies, soluble TLRs may reduce TLR signaling by binding to circulating ligands, rendering them unable to initiate pro-inflammatory signaling. Brandl et al. demonstrated that the synthetic molecule \"LPS-Trap\" was capable of blocking LPS-mediated macrophage activation in vitro by fusing MD-2 to the C-terminus of a soluble form of TLR4 (118) . Iwami et al. cloned an alternatively spliced soluble murine TLR4 (smTLR4) that, when transfected into murine macrophages, was secreted and inhibited LPS-mediated macrophage NF-\u03baB activation and TNF-\u03b1 release in vitro (119) . In addition, TLR-signaling intermediates have been targeted chemically to minimize the host inflammatory response. The synthetic peptide-mimetic compound ST2825 prevents MyD88 homodimer formation leading to an inhibition in MyD88dependent signaling, and prevents TLR9dependent inflammation in vivo (120) . A cyclohexene derivative, TAK-242, prevents TLR4 activation and was found to reduce the cytokine response to endotoxemic shock in mice (121, 122) . The Vaccinia virus protein A52R also reduces the TLR-mediated response by interacting with IRAK2 and TRAF6, and was found to reduce the cytokine response in an animal model of infectious otitis media (123, 124) and to increase survival in models of endotoxemia (125) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 880, "end": 885, "text": "(116)", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 959, "end": 964, "text": "(116)", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1027, "text": "(117)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1106, "text": "(117)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1463, "text": "(118)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1688, "text": "(119)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1989, "end": 1994, "text": "(120)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2137, "text": "(121,", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2142, "text": "122)", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2350, "text": "(123,", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2355, "text": "124)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 2406, "end": 2411, "text": "(125)", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THERAPEUTIC MANIPULATION OF TLR SIGNALING IN THE SETTING OF MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION"}, {"text": "As the effects of TLR signaling in hematopoietic cells, as well as epithelial cells, are more clearly defined, manipulation of TLR signaling may play a larger role in the treatment of patients with diseases of inflammation, and, as evidence continues to mount suggesting a protective role for particular TLR signaling, directed and specific TLR activation may hold therapeutic promise.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THERAPEUTIC MANIPULATION OF TLR SIGNALING IN THE SETTING OF MUCOSAL INFLAMMATION"}, {"text": "Mucosal surfaces and the epithelial cells that line them are constantly exposed to potential pathogens.

Under basal conditions, epithelial-bacterial interactions that may occur via TLRs are likely to play roles in the regulation of processes that regulate barrier integrity, such as epithelial migration, proliferation, and apoptosis ( Figure 3A ). However, during states of systemic stress, such as hypoxia or remote infection, we submit that the extent of TLR signaling within the epithelium becomes exaggerated in response to PAMPS and DAMPS that are encountered. This \"tips the balance\" in favor of mucosal barrier disruption, and adversely affects mucosal repair while worsening mucosal injury ( Figure 3B ). The extent of inflammation that develops within the local microenvironment likely is compounded further by the contribution of TLR activation on leukocytes, and the release of proinflammatory molecules. Under conditions in which the balance of TLR signaling within the epithelium can be \"tipped back\" to a homeostatic state, mucosal inflammation may not develop. By contrast, when the extent of TLR signaling is persistent, we propose that a \"feedforward\" loop develops within the mucosa, resulting in persistent TLR signaling, cytokine release, and mucosal inflammation.

The field of mucosal inflammation research is likely to be advanced significantly through success in the following areas of study: 1) What are the relative roles of TLR signaling within the epithelium versus circulating leukocytes in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation? 2) What is the precise trigger for TLR signaling within the epithelium that adversely affects the host, and what are the essential roles played by mucosal TLRs in the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis? 3) Are there TLR-signaling molecular intermediates that differ between epithelial cells and leukocytes, and do such molecules confer epithelial-specific responses in the development of mucosal inflammation? 4) What regulates the interplay between the epithelium and the other cellular constituents of the mucosa, including neurons, endothelial cells, and endocrine cells during TLR activation?
