Indeed, barriers to implementing lowtidal volume have been identified and might explain physician behavior [28] . Despite this, plateau pressures did remain below 30 cmH 2 O [29] , indicating that lung compliance might have been preserved. Perhaps clinicians focused on plateau pressures rather than on tidal volumes [30] since it still remains unclear which should be limited to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury [31] . We, like others [6, 7, 32, 33] , could not find differences in utilized tidal volumes between survivors and non-survivors. Even so, non-survivors tended to display lower values, probably reflecting physician efforts to intensify protective ventilation strategies in the most severely compromised. Some researchers [34, 35] have suggested that allowing higher tidal volumes in a population of young and previously healthy patients with strong ventilatory drive might reveal an attempt to restrain heavy sedation and neuromuscular blocker use.
