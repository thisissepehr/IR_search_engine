A biographical-narrative approach is used to analyse the roles played by the virologists Albert Osterhaus, Roel Coutinho and Jaap Goudsmit in policy and public debate. These figures were among the few leading virologists visibly active in the Netherlands during the revival of infectious diseases in the 1980s. Osterhaus and Coutinho in particular are still the key figures today, as demonstrated during the outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1). This article studies the various political and communicative challenges and dilemmas encountered by these three virologists, and discusses the way in which, strategically or not, they handled those challenges and dilemmas during the various stages of the field's recent history. Important in this respect is their pursuit of a public role that is both effective and credible. We will conclude with a reflection on the H1N1 pandemic, and the historical and biographical ties between emerging governance arrangements and the experts involved in the development of such arrangements.",

In the Netherlands, the experts who not only frequently informed the public and investigated the virus, but also predicted the pandemic's course and handled public health policy problems, were figures that had assumed this role ever since the 'revival' of infectious diseases in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The general public, politicians, journalists and sceptics alike were already familiar with their names and faces, reputations and views, and even with their tactics and styles of handling such affairs.",

Although textual sources (media coverage, policy reports and so on) are used as a backdrop and frame of reference, the basic source of input for my study is a series of narrative interviews with the experts themselves. Before turning to the case study as such, I will outline the theoretical and methodological framework of my research. I will also place biographical research in the broader field of science studies and discuss the methodological opportunities and risks involved in such an approach.",

In this context, a biographical approach has two major advantages. First of all, a biographical approach allows us to study the individual views of the experts themselves and the assessments of their own roles. Secondly, a biographical approach allows us to flesh out the relationship between experts, policymaking and public communication.",

Hoppe, for instance, described the views of scientific experts as boundary workers, and discerned several ways of looking at the science-policy boundary (Hoppe 2009 ). Huitema and Turnhout (2009) focus on the institutional level and describe the 'political' roles of experts working in a Dutch boundary organisation. Claire Waterton (2005) also focused on the science-politics boundary, in particular in the field of research policy and funding. Together with Sarah Davies (2008) , who describes the views held by scientists regarding the science-public boundary, these authors analyse the outlooks of individual scientists working across the boundaries of their organisations and disciplines. One of the challenges of discussing the views of scientists in the science-policy and science-public zones is to point out how each of the experts acted in these boundary zones and how they negotiated tensions within these zones, creating an identity for themselves in the process.",

In this paper we will look at the experts and their expertise from a relational or social role perspective (Collins and Evans 2007, p. 2) . We treat the role of experts not as a given solid state, but as something in flux. This flux is the net result of interactions between the actions of individuals, and the attributing of trust and credibility by others (viz. Goffman 1959, pp. 15-16; Wynne 1992, p. 282; Huitema and Turnhout 2009, p. 579) , turning the experts into 'hybrid characters' (Daston and Sibum 2003) . A role in this understanding cannot be attributed solely to what the individual expert wants. Roles are contingent outcomes of these interactions, in which trust and credibility play a crucial part.",

Crises as focusing events challenge experts to inform and comment on the crisis, to assist in the development of appropriate policies, and more generally to sketch the prospects of where the crisis is heading (Birkland 1997) . Understood as such, we will see how crises function as springboards for experts from relative invisibility to visibility, and how experts are thus invited or forced to develop their own style of crisis management. Some authors point to the strategic use of crises in inducing policy change (Kingdon 1995; Birkland 1997; Weingart et al. 2000) . These sources demonstrate that a crisis is not something that 'just happens' to experts, but that experts, as policy entrepreneurs, also shape and give voice to crises. They tend to use moments of crises to 'capture attention for their causes', at times even by 'overselling to the media' (Weingart 1999, p. 159 ; see also Edwards 1999, p. 169) .",

We find examples of this approach in anthropological laboratory studies (Traweek 1988) , feminist studies of science (Abir-Am and Outram 1987), the sociology of science (Zuckerman 1977; Goodell 1977; Kissmann 2007) , the history of science (Porter 2006; Nye 2006; Terrall 2006) and the epistemology of science (Zwart 2008). The biographical-narrative method used here combines socialhistorical studies and narrative analysis, and provides an idiographic view on expertise in the form of 'expert narratives'. To produce these narratives, data from various types and sources were ordered around a specific 'plot' or thematic thread Virology Experts in the Boundary Zone 147 (Polkinghorne 2005, p. 69) : the advancement of virologists from laboratory experts into experts on policy and the public domain. The inductive development of narratives involved four iterative stages. In the first stage, data were collected on the academic and public track records of the three virologists, and on the socio-historical context of infectious diseases in which these virologists were situated. This was used to prepare biographical-narrative interviews, 1 the second step. These interviews focused on their experiences in policymaking and public debate. The experts also commented on each other in these interviews. The third step was to organise the data temporally, hereby focusing on the diachronic data (data on events, their relations and the effects of events). This step included the collection of additional data, for example by conducting a second round of interviews. In the final stage, the expert careers were written down as coherent and empirically-grounded narratives, thereby 'explicating an intrinsically meaningful form' (Polkinghorne 2005, p. 93) .",

As to the methodological validity of the narratives that emerge in this manner, it is important to see that the production process of narratives takes place on various levels. The first level is the level of the actual events as experienced by the experts involved, the so-called lived story (Rosenthal 2005, p. 27; Wengraf 2000) . Subsequently the experts themselves will reflect on these events retrospectively and from a certain distance. This level can be referred to as the told story. Finally, as a result of the interactions, post hoc reflections and reframings between interviewee and researcher, 2 the written story as a third level of narrative emerges 3 (Littig 2008, par. 17) .

Narrating is a way of constructing ones identity (Brockmeier and Carbaugh 2001, p. 15; Bruner 2001, pp. 34-35) . In the course of constructing a 'front region' narrative, the identities the virologists assume as experts shape their actions and interventions, allowing them to present themselves in a way they find desirable (Goffman 1959) . Narratives not only constrain, they also enable action (Deuten and Rip 2000, p. 72) . By being involved in narrative processes in biographical-narrative interviews, and by intervening in the identity constructions, one actually comes closer to the lived story. 1 Interviews with experts or elites differ remarkably from other kinds of interviews; for a brief discussion see Beate Littig (2008). 2 In this paper I unfortunately cannot illustrate this dimension with a structural analysis of the narratives. For reasons of space I therefore limit myself to a thematic analysis (see Riessman 2008, chapters 3-4) . 3 The virologists themselves also produce written narratives on their roles, creating fascinating comparative research material on narrativity and identity (see Goudsmit 2009; Coutinho 2 February 2010) .",

The Ministries of Health and of Agriculture are the two major policymaking bodies in the domain of infectious diseases, while local (Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdiensten, GGD) and national (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, RIVM) public health institutes have an executive task. University Medical Centres (UMCs) play a more independent role. A central advisory body is the Dutch Health Council (Gezondheidsraad, GR) . The Health Council is an advisory body that presents the 'state of affairs' of science, and explicitly advises policy, it does not make it (Interview Knottnerus & De Visser. 30 January 2006; Bijker et al. 2009 ). In 2005, the Centre for Infectious Disease Control was established as a specialised body for scientific advice and outbreak control, emerging as a new boundary organisation in the Dutch institutional landscape (CIDC, see Ministry of Health 7 December 2004). The Dutch advisory sector for infectious diseases can thus be characterised as a 'corporatist policy arrangement', with a restricted and formally accredited set of experts that act on personal title (Halffman and Hoppe 2005, p. 137; Bijker et al. 2009, pp. 85-86) . On an international level we find the European Scientific Working Group on Influenza (ESWI), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and of course the World Health Organization (WHO).",

It constituted a challenge and problem for human virology, accompanied by a sudden influx of research funding, public concern and policy development. 5 Furthermore, there was an aggressive viral outbreak in seals in the North and Baltic Seas around 1988, which killed tens of thousands of seals. BSE was seen just before this, putting veterinary virology firmly on the map and introducing virologists into the midst of political and public debate.

For the virologists this was a moment to once again assume visibility in public debate and involvement in policy development. The first H5N1 deaths marked the advent of a second crisis. Besides fears of an avian influenza pandemic, scientists and politicians were concerned about the growing threat of bioterrorism and outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. Finally, the outbreak of SARS in 2003 came as a complete surprise. It was SARS that highlighted the real danger of pandemic outbreaks, but that also triggered the awareness of preparedness and prevention plans as new instruments in preventing a pandemic from developing to its full capacity (Osterhaus 6 March 2009).",

In the early years, no one believed BSE could become a human pathogen; 'people said it was just scrapie' (Osterhaus 6 March 2008). 6 However, Osterhaus suspected it could indeed become a human pathogen, and in 1988 he pursued it to the EU policymaking arena with backing from his director. As chairman of the EEC Scientific Veterinary Committee he acted cautiously. Nevertheless, he met with scepticism, since pointing out the possible public health dangers went against the grain of policymakers. He did not refrain from setting policy machinery in motion, and a proposal for legislation on the various dangers of BSE was issued almost monthly. In his opinion, this had its effect on policy processes (Osterhaus 29 July 2008).",

However, Greenpeace opposed his conclusion: they were convinced that pollution or poisonous algae had caused the fatalities, since this fitted their own objectives. This disagreement with the environmentalists challenged Osterhaus to prove he was right, and he conducted extensive experiments with seals. To his surprise these studies did identify pollution as a contributing factor in the seals' deaths, but as an indirect causal factor: it made them less resistant. Osterhaus considered this a success: he had discredited his own hypothesis and discovered a causal chain more nuanced than either he himself or Greenpeace had expected (Osterhaus 6 March 2008). The research on seal death, that started in 1985 and has continued ever since, has had an enormous impact on several aspects of Osterhaus' career. It delivered him his first four Nature publications in 1988 and 1989, and many other papers followed. His reputation grew, and the conflict with Greenpeace pulled him into political and public debates. Due to the seal death research he also became scientific advisor to a national seal shelter.",

He was self-confident in his estimations about risks, but also acknowledged criticism from his sceptics. The tricky question was when to stick to his original position, and when to adopt the opposing view, and, consequently, the appropriate strategy. This, he says, created a tension: on the one hand he had his own gut feelings, and at the same time he tried to think through competing viewpoints. There was not only an epistemological choice to be made, but also a balancing act to carry out: considering various interests and health threats. We will characterise his role as that of the strategic scientist: someone who carefully balances different viewpoints and forms of evidence, but who also has the strategic skills and will to further his own case.",

The results were alarming: 30% of the participating 750 homosexuals were infected with HIV, revealing an urgent public health issue. However, as homosexuals were in a process of emancipation, they feared discrimination and blame for bringing HIV/Aids into the world. Disease prevention did not outweigh this concern. Since Coutinho saw that both homosexuals and drug users tended not to take the danger of infection seriously (as they had previously done with venereal diseases), he used the statistics to make them aware of the scale and nature of the epidemic. His rationale was that without being open about a problem, one cannot start solving it. Also, covering up the truth implies a disdain for society and is likely to result in a loss of credibility (Coutinho 13 May 2008; Mooij 2004; Andere tijden 26 November 2002) .",

Expert hibernation in this sense does not mean he was entirely absent in the media or in policymaking, but compared to the preceding and following periods there was a significant decrease of exposure. There is one event, however, which demonstrates his view as an expert on health problems. After a decline in HIV/Aids cases in 1993, he later reported the epidemic to be far from over, and stated how he thought the problem should be prevented: 'It makes a huge difference when you get the problem out in the open' (Trouw 5 December 1998) . This strategy was put to the test during the 1980s, and it passed. He says that it has been the key to his expert policy and still is today.",

In 1990, Goudsmit and Osterhaus received funding to develop a candidate HIV vaccine. In 1992, the former was very confident about the prospects for such a vaccine (Trouw 24 March 1992) ; but just two years later we see a mixed attitude: Goudsmit is still optimistic regarding the possibilities of a vaccine, although he thinks that it will require international coordination and prolonged collaboration (Parool 26 March 1994) . That is what he Virology Experts in the Boundary Zone 155 therefore endeavours: in 1994, Goudsmit becomes a co-founder of the IAVI, the International Aids Vaccine Initiative. In the meantime, the joint project with Osterhaus fails, in part because they 'entirely underestimated the difficulties in developing a vaccine' (Goudsmit in Mooij 2004, p. 164 ). Goudsmit is currently still active in the development of vaccines, but his prospects for an HIV vaccine are sombre (NRC Handelsblad 1 December 2007; Goudsmit 19 May 2008) . In Goudsmit's own words, the hubristic expert discovered that he was not that knowledgeable at all, that despite all his knowledge about HIV he could not produce a vaccine. This is what in effect changed the way in which he performs as an expert in public. As he became painfully aware of the limits of his expertise, Goudsmit changed into an expert who wants to be in strict control of what to say, when, where and to whom (Goudsmit 2 April 2008).",

Virologists, including Osterhaus, urged the WHO to develop pandemic preparedness plans, which was done instantly. In an individual capacity, he then initiated a meeting to discuss the appropriate policy responses for Europe. Besides him initiating the meeting, it is interesting to see how he organised this meeting and steered its outcomes. Osterhaus was a well-known and respected figure in the European health policy scene, belonging to some of the key scientific or health care committees. A first move he made when organising the 1998 meeting was to hand it over to an EU civil servant, now the meeting's captain. The civil servant would take credit for this meeting, and it would also be political. The second move was to select the participants, including the responsible EU commissioner and a range of influential virologists. By selecting the participants himself, Osterhaus brought together a specific body of political power and scientific expertise; and he managed to orchestrate the political process in a direction he deemed optimal without drawing attention to himself. Osterhaus strategically translated his pandemic warning into an official and visible EU committee.",

We can be sure a new pandemic will arrive, and unless we take appropriate measures, hundreds of thousands will die'. Although the pandemic warning was a policy lubricant (Parool 26 April 2001) , Osterhaus believed in the reality of this message and he says it was a plain technical assessment (Osterhaus 6 March 2008). His colleagues, however, believed the message to be an overstatement, bordering on lobbying for research funds (Coutinho 13 May 2008; Goudsmit 2 April 2008 , 19 May 2008 Van der Noordaa 7 May 2008) . They also say that Osterhaus' tone has tempered over the years, perhaps because the discursive strategy has had its desired effects, perhaps because the scientific reality has changed. 13 This tension between his own scientific gut feeling and the scepticism of his critics is a dilemma he dubbed the 'cry wolf dilemma'. This 'visionary virologist' had to perform a balancing act between two extremes: on the one hand the credible but reticent academic, on the other hand the 'incredible fool' (Osterhaus 6 March 2008); and the longer it took for a pandemic to strike, the more his credibility would be at stake.",

As the topics have become far less controversial and political than they were during the 1980s, the contributions to policy and to the public sphere are also more technical (determining risks, developing preparedness plans). This makes him a technical spokesman.",

It is his habit of selecting the more regulated battlefields that is a very distinct feature of his expert career after the mid-1990s (Goudsmit 2 April 2008) . He chooses spaces he feels comfortable and secure in, spaces that respect the strict boundaries of his expertise. Although these factors are important in understanding why Goudsmit takes up a certain role, in practice the different constituents are difficult to discern. Two loci where he prefers to act are the courtroom and the study, writing popular science books. In a long laudation on his experiences as a courtroom expert, 15 he describes it as the site where expertise is used in the 'purest way possible' outside of science, where all agendas lie open and only the expert's knowledge is questioned. The courtroom enhances the separation of facts and their interpretation; the juridical boundaries create a regulated environment, which is appreciated by Goudsmit (Goudsmit 2 April 2008) .",

Following years of a pandemic warning, the rapid spread of SARS, and numerous actual or possible outbreaks, politicians in the Netherlands were well aware that the lack of political responsibility, coordination, and strategic planning for outbreaks needed to be addressed. Furthermore, in 2003 a veterinarian died after being infected with bird flu. 16 This focusing event (Birkland 1997) triggered the shift to the fifth stage, during which there were endeavours to increase control over the viral threats.

The experts based their methods on the early-career understandings of the relationship between science, politics and the public domain. This article opens up the biographical-narrative 'black box' of these experts, and the enactment of that biography in practice (Goffman 1959; Deuten and Rip 2000; Brockmeier and Carbaugh 2001) . Learning experiences, personal or communal reflections on specific events, the continuous process of re-narrating and reframing past experiences, all added up to an individual conviction on 'how to perform as a credible expert'. In Coutinho's case, we might say that his self-perception as an expert has not changed dramatically, but solidified in a repertoire of communicating the facts. Goudsmit, on the other hand, following a redefinition of his expertise, radically changed the way in which perceived his role in policy and in public debate. Then we have Osterhaus, who still finds himself in a continuous balancing act between a credible scientist, a policy entrepreneur, a public communicator and an industry advisor. The biographical-narrative approach has elucidated how each of them have accommodated themselves in the boundary zone between science, policy and public debate, and thus juxtaposes with a more macro-sociological understanding of expertise, such as Nowotny's 'narrative of expertise' (Nowotny 2000) .",

The studies of Coutinho and Osterhaus demonstrate that since they were pioneers in the development of new governance arrangements, they remained central figures in these arrangements for infectious disease control. The emerging governance structures and the pioneering virologists remained tied together. It is no accident that when the CIDC was being set up, Osterhaus and Coutinho were the prime, if not only, candidate directors. Up until the H1N1 pandemic, these two virologists were the key figures in policymaking and public debate. In cases where new governance arrangements emerge, we can thus expect the leading figures in that process to remain tied to those arrangements. It is certainly relevant to scrutinise the degree in which the experts themselves strive to remain tied, whether the arrangements as such keep them tied, and why. This article demonstrates how the involvement of certain figures is understandable from a historical and biographical perspective.",

Without wishing to pass direct judgment on either Coutinho or Osterhaus, I suggest that biographical ties should not grant access by default. Probing these dimensions, as this study does, assists in the assessment of the nature and structure of contemporary governance arrangements, the persons involved and their relationships to science, politics and the public sphere. Although this does not provide a prescriptive approach to expertise, such as that suggested by Collins and Evans (Collins and Evans 2007) , it may help to critically question the almost automatic policy involvement of some experts.",

As norms and expectations for credibility and authority change over time, these experts cannot rely on the crystallised understandings of their roles and their settled positions in governance arrangements. During the course of the pandemic, for various reasons, Osterhaus' and Coutinho's credibilities were severely damaged and their authorities disputed. Osterhaus' balancing act could not withstand the growing wave of criticism (Enserink 2009) , and Coutinho's notion of medical authority was challenged down to the bone (Coutinho 2 February 2010). These controversies raise a call for a more thorough reflection on their roles, both within governance and public communication. Answering that call, this article tells us, is a continuous struggle and challenge.",
