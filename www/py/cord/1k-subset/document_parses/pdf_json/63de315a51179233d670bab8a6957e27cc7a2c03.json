Importantly, these respiratory complications appeared before initiation of anti-malarial drug treatment, an observation also reported in two other severe clinical cases of lung injury due to P. vivax [19, 20] . Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain lung damage in P. vivax malaria infections. The first suggests that there is no sequestration of P. vivax-infected reticulocytes in the deep capillaries of internal organs, postulating instead an inflammatory process due to an increase in capillary permeability associated with cytokine-induced damage in the pulmonary epithelium [21] . The second suggests cytoadherence of P. vivax-infected reticulocytes in lung capillaries, causing obstruction of blood flow and reduction of respiratory function before treatment and alveolar capillary damage and inflammation 24 to 48 hours after initiation of anti-malarial drug treatment [22] . The possibility that antibiotics given 24 hours before respiratory failure might have destroyed P. vivax-infected reticulocytes, inducing lung damage and favouring the second hypothesis, cannot formally rule out. Yet, it is clear that the lack of sequestration in P. vivax needs to be re-evaluated, as cytoadherence has been hypothesized to occur in both the spleen [23, 24] and the lungs [22] .",

Interestingly, after the appearance of chloroquine resistance in P. vivax, reports of clinical severity exclusively associated with this human malaria parasite started to appear [2] . Moreover, multidrug resistance has been recently suggested to be associated, albeit not directly linked, with severe disease in P. vivax [14] . Remarkably, higher expression levels of pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o, in particular, were found in parasites from the patient with severe clinical symptoms compared to three patients with mild symptoms. The levels were increased by up to 2.9 fold in the case of pvmdr1 (when including all samples) and up to 21.9 fold in the case of pvcrt-o. Confounding effects due to sample concentrations or contamination with P. falciparum or human material were excluded by using P. vivaxspecific primers and \u03b2-tubulin as an internal control and calibrator. This data thus indicates that severe vivax disease could be associated to molecular markers.",

            "text": "There are increasing reports of severe disease exclusively associated with vivax malaria and this study presents the first one in Spain. The use of PCR excluded incompetent microscopy, cryptic mixed infections or sequestered P. falciparum reinforcing the need of using PCR as a new diagnostic tool to avoid default diagnosis of severe malaria as due to P. falciparum. The finding on increased expression levels of parasite genes likely involved in chloroquine resistance supports to furthering explore the potential of pvmdr1 and particularly pvcrt-o as molecular markers of severe disease in P. vivax.",
