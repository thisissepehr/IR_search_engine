            "text": "Infl uenza A (H5N1) viruses are strong candidates for causing the next infl uenza pandemic if they acquire the ability for effi cient human-to-human transmission. A major public health goal is to make effi cacious vaccines against these viruses by using novel approaches, including cell-culture system, reverse genetics, and adjuvant development. Important consideration for the strategy includes preparation of vaccines from a currently circulating strain to induce broad-spectrum immunity toward newly emerged human H5 strains. This strategy would be a good solution early in a pandemic until an antigenically matched and approved vaccine is produced. The concept of therapeutic vaccines (e.g., antidisease vaccine) directed at diminishing the cytokine storm frequently seen in subtype H5N1-infected persons is underscored. Better understanding of host-virus interaction is essential to identify tools to produce effective vaccines against infl uenza (H5N1).",

Establishment of the highly pathogenic avian infl uenza (H5N1) as an endemic virus within duck and poultry populations and its capacity to cross species barriers increase the possibility of adaptation to humans and a pandemic. Human infl uenza infections with subtype H5N1 viruses are often fatal. As of June 4, 2007 , 309 laboratoryconfi rmed cases of human infection have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO); 61% were fatal, mainly in persons 10-39 years of age (www.who.int/csr/ caculatordisease/avian_infl uenza/en). If a pandemic is triggered by transmissibility of infl uenza (H5N1) from person to person, millions of people could die, and economies would likely be crippled for 6-24 months.",

            "text": "The host response to infl uenza (H5N1) infection has not been defi ned, which has proven a considerable challenge in epidemiology and public health research. To develop effi cient vaccines, understanding how the virus interacts with the host in natural infection is necessary. Having insights into the hosts' responses to infl uenza (H5N1) would help defi ne targets for therapeutic intervention. Whether humans can develop immunity during a primary infection that would control replication and spread of subtype H5N1 viruses has been questioned (1). However, marked infl ammatory responses develop after infection with infl uenza (H5N1) in humans and other animals (2) (3) (4) . This condition is associated with statistically signifi cant synthesis of various proinfl ammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b1, and chemokines, including IP-10, MIG, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, IL-8, and RANTES. i.e., regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted). If this is the case, these observations are consistent with the possible induction of innate immune responsiveness in the persons infected with infl uenza (H5N1 (5) . The death rate of \u224825% was half that of previously known outbreaks, and 5 mild or completely asymptomatic cases have been reported. One theory holds that milder cases have been occurring elsewhere but are not being recorded. Recently, 3 persons among 120 apparently healthy volunteers from the People's Republic of China, showed detectable virus-neutralizing antibody response to subtype H5N1 before vaccination (6) . Moreover, pigs infected with subtype H5N1 have become asymptomatic in Indonesia. Are these signs of development of some degree of immunity to virus, containing its replication and thus causing milder infection in naturally infected mammals? Recently, clusters of bird fl u cases were reported in Western Java, Indonesia (7); fatal disease developed in 6 persons there from the same family. Two other family members became ill but survived. All the family members likely had similar levels of exposure because they all lived in the same household. Other cases of nonfatal infections have been seen in Thailand and Vietnam. Unfortunately, there is little information about the immune response to the virus in those who survived, which would be valuable for understanding the mechanisms of protection. Indeed, following up the persons (cohort) living in the same affected villages, presumably mostly not exposed to virus, should clarify whether the maintained response refl ects boosting through natural exposure. Persons with prior exposure, as measured by antibody or viral RNA at recruitment, would likely have substantially higher responses to the vaccine than those na\u00efve at recruitment if the vaccinating antigen contains homologous or cross-reacting determinants. Conceivably, boosting the \"natural\" immunity is a desirable outcome to improve protective effi cacy of any vaccine approach. Additional studies are required to evaluate the merits of priming populations in advance of an infl uenza (H5N1) pandemic.",

Antigenic drift relies on the accumulation of mutations within the antibody-binding sites in the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), or both that abrogate the binding of antibodies. This makes infl uenza A virus strains able to evade neutralizing antibody from prior infection or vaccination. Antigenic shift, which is seen only with infl uenza A viruses, is a more drastic change. It results from genetic shift by reassortment exchange of the HA, and sometimes the NA, with novel subtypes that have not been present in human viruses for a long time. Antigenic shift leads to replacement of circulating strains with new variants that are able to reinfect hosts immune to earlier types; the result is usually a pandemic. Antigenic shifts caused 2 of the major infl uenza A pandemics in the last century, including the 1957 subtype H2N2 and 1968 subtype H3N2 outbreaks (10) .",

Virus particles that lack the gene for the nuclear export protein or are defective for the matrix (M2) gene were used as live vaccines in animal models (12, 13) ; however, whether these replication-defective vaccines will work in humans is not known. Live attenuated (cold-adapted) infl uenza vaccines have long been used in Russia, and a similar product has been approved for use in the United States (14) . These vaccines will replicate in the host, and thus lower doses may be effective; however, the preexisting antibody to the virus is more likely to diminish the value of a live vaccine. Moreover, such live vaccines are reported to cause asthma-like reactivity in children (15) .

            "text": "With the use of a technique known as reverse genetics, a prototype of infl uenza virus (H5N1) has been produced for the development of an inactivated subvirion vaccine. The gene segments encoding HA and NA were derived from A/Vietnam/2004, and all other genes were derived from the backbone (A/PR/8/34) virus, commonly used as a platform for infl uenza vaccine production. The HA gene was further modifi ed to replace the stretch of 6 basic amino acids at the cleavage site, and the resulting virus was avirulent in chickens. In a recent trial, healthy adult volunteers were given 2 intramuscular doses of this inactivated infl uenza (H5N1) vaccine. This split vaccine induced an antibody response predictive of protection in 54% of healthy adults tested, but only when given intramuscularly at high doses (two 90-\u03bcg shots) (16) . The large amounts needed (2 doses of vaccine, each 6 times the dosage of that used in a standard infl uenza shot) means that hundreds of millions of doses are needed to tackle a pandemic. Dose-sparing approaches, including the use of an effi cient nontoxic adjuvant to boost persons' immune responses, may improve the vaccine. Another trial was performed with 300 healthy participants 18-40 years of age, in which aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was used with similar split-virus vaccine (17) . However, the alumadjuvanted vaccines did not improve the immunogenicity or percentage of seroconversion at lower vaccine doses and only slightly improved immunogenicity at the 30-\u03bcg dose. This diffi culty underscores the importance of vigorous fundamental research to address the question of how to increase the immunogenicity of such vaccines, whether by better antigen presentation or by choosing alternative routes of administration, so that lesser amount of antigen could be given to induce protective response. The present annual global production capacity is \u2248300 million doses of trivalent vaccine containing 15 \u03bcg HA per strain. This is equivalent to 900 million doses of monovalent vaccine, a quantity markedly insuffi cient for the world's 6.5 billion people. Clearly, dose-sparing formulations are urgently needed.",

An inactivated vaccine that induces not only high levels of neutralizing antibody to surface proteins but also CD8 Tcell response against well-conserved antigens derived from internal viral proteins might provide superior protection in an epidemic or pandemic. In cases of established intracellular infl uenza A infection, infected cells are mainly eliminated by effector CD8+ T cells (CTLs) (18) . Any vaccine that will induce and direct these CTLs to the site of infection and generate a long-lasting memory response will be more effective for mounting protection against a pandemic form of infl uenza (H5N1). Inactivated vaccines need to be presented to the host's immune system with an appropriate adjuvant, but inactivated vaccines that use an adjuvant currently approved for human use (alum or MF-59) usually have lower immunogenicity than live attenuated vaccines (10) . Therefore, the pursuit for other nontoxic adjuvants, including TLR ligands and agonists that could effectively activate dendritic cells for the presentation of viral antigens to CD4 and CD8 T cells, should vigorously be continued. Use of cytokines such as IL-12 or IL-18 may enhance the immunogenicity of antiviral vaccines. Recombinant fowlpox vaccines coexpressing HA of subtype H5N1 and chicken IL-18 have been shown to induce complete protection in vaccinated chickens (19) . Use of adjuvants may enhance broader cross-reactive immune responses among infl uenza viruses (20) .",

Genetically engineered viruses could be constructed; these would express several variant antigens or determinants, thereby generating a broader immune response. The goal would be to develop vaccines that would induce broad-spectrum immunity-conferring protection to infl uenza including subtype H5N1. Ferrets vaccinated with A/PR/8/34 single-gene reassortants that differed only in their H5s were protected against a lethal challenge with A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus, suggesting generation of crossprotection (22) . Vaccination of mice with a live attenuated infl uenza vaccine or an alum-adjuvanted inactivated infl u-enza vaccine based on a related H5 HA from a nonpathogenic avian infl uenza virus, A/Duck/Pottsdam/1042-6/86 (H5N2), limited the disease severity and reduced deaths following challenge with a current highly pathogenic infl uenza (H5N1) (23) . Such cross-protective vaccines may provide clinical protection and prevent deaths in the early stages of a pandemic.",

Studies that used the M2eA peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein illustrated good immune responses not only in mice but also in ferrets and rhesus monkeys (30) . In a recent study, 3 M2eA sequences, representing a range of epidemic strains and the (H5N1) strain, were fused to a proprietary hydrophobic protein domain. The resulting fusion proteins, formulated in liposomes, stimulated a protective response in mice challenged with subtypes H1N1, H5N1, H6N2, or H9N2 (31) . Previous studies have shown that when M2e is linked to hepatitis B virus core (HBc) particles, it becomes highly immunogenic, eliciting protective antibody response in mice (25) . Recently, a series of M2e-HBc constructs were made by increasing the copy number of M2e inserted at the N terminus from 1 to 3 per monomer. The best protection was seen when mice were vaccinated intranasally with these constructs combined with CTA1-DD, a cholera toxin A1-derived mucosal adjuvant (32) .",

If this is true, this could have important implications for developing new therapeutics. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemophagocytosis, or both, develop in a substantial fraction of patients with infl uenza (H5N1) infection; both of these conditions are thought to be promoted by overproduction of proinfl ammatory cytokines (known as a \"cytokine storm\") (37) . Consistent with these observations, cytokine release was markedly enhanced in human macrophages after infection with infl uenza (H5N1) (38) . Further, marked enhancement of chemokine and cytokine levels was observed in infl uenza (H5N1)-infected persons, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with high and disseminated viral replication (4). Additionally, infl uenza (H5N1) viruses appear relatively resistant to the inhibitory effects of host antiviral cytokines, such as interferons (IFNs) (39) . Thus, the severity of human infl uenza (H5N1) infection may be related to the induction of excessive proinfl ammatory responses that can accompany a primary infection and high viral shedding. Increased infl ammation was associated with viral replication in the respiratory and extrarespiratory organs of cats experimentally infected with infl uenza (H5N1) (3) . Mice infected with the highly pathogenic infl uenza (H5N1) strain A/HK/156/97, originally obtained from diseased chickens and an ill child in Hong Kong, China (HK), showed reduced ability to activate transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), a potent antiinfl ammatory cytokine, compared to mice infected with less virulent A/Env/HK437/99 viruses (2) . The reduced ability to activate TGF-\u03b2 may produce greater infl ammation at the site of infection and thus cause more severe disease. Alternatively, the low levels of activated TGF-\u03b2 in the sera of A/HK/156/97-infected mice may allow the viruses to replicate and spread unchecked in the respiratory tracts of the mice, causing more severe disease. Recently, the impact of the nonstructural (NS) gene variation of Hong Kong (H5N1)/97 on cytokine production was illustrated (40) . The NS gene reassortant induced elevated pulmonary concentrations of the infl ammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and chemokine KC and decreased concentrations of the anti-infl ammatory cytokine IL-10. This cytokine imbalance is reminiscent of the clinical fi ndings in humans infected with infl uenza (H5N1)/97 virus and may explain the unusual severity of the disease.",

By engineering a virus with site-specifi c changes in the genome (for example in NS gene), we may produce infl uenza virus vaccine that favors the production of benefi cial anti-infl ammatory cytokines but remains highly immunogenic. In another approach, a human replicationincompetent, adenoviral vector-based infl uenza vaccine could be developed, in which genes of anti-infl ammatory cytokines are coexpressed, which will inhibit overproduction of proinfl ammatory cytokines. Such vaccines would be considered therapeutic vaccines (e.g., antidisease vaccines), which would inhibit infl ammation at the site of infection and protect against severe disease (Figure) . Excessive production of anti-infl ammatory cytokines may result in an inappropriate suppression of the host immune response. Further studies will validate the benefi cial effect of the anti-infl ammatory response for temporizing the cytokine storm seen in infl uenza (H5N1). Development of an immunization protocol that uses an adjuvant that allows selective priming of an antigen-specifi c immunoregulatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-\u03b2) would be a major advance in the development of a vaccine for bird fl u with a substantial infl ammatory component. The search for potential adjuvants, such as TLR ligands and agonists that will favor the synthesis of inhibitory cytokines including IL-10, should be pursued. By testing whether manipulation of infl ammatory pathways changes the pathologic course, we would identify new targets for disease intervention.",

Defi ning the host response to infl uenza (H5N1) in natural infection is urgently needed to better understand the basis of protection and subsequent development of effi cacious vaccines. Improved vaccine strategies, which will require less antigen and be more robust in inducing both antibody and cell-mediated immunity for neutralizing infl uenza (H5N1) viruses, should be considered. To create an effective vaccine, a combination of factors must be optimized-such as number of doses, formulation without or with better adjuvant, and dose range. We also need to develop a reproducible assay that measures immunogenicity of a vaccine and to establish adequate correlates of protection. The effi cacy of potential cross-reactive vaccine candidates to induce broad-spectrum immunity to infl uenza (H5N1) viruses should be assessed critically; stockpiling of such vaccines may be justifi ed in the absence of optimally matched and approved vaccine during early stages of an H5 pandemic. Search for therapeutic vaccines (antidisease vaccines) aimed at controlling innate immune responses should be pursued, given the clinical evidence that the H5N1 subtype elicits a cytokine storm that contributes to disease pathogenesis. Vaccine development and deploy-ment need to be undertaken by a partnership of academia, government, and industry. The risk for dissemination of pandemic virus will remain if the disease is controlled in 1 area but not in others. A global approach is vital for combating the next infl uenza pandemic, a monumental public health challenge.",
