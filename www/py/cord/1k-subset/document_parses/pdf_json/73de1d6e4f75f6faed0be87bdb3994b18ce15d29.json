The required prolonged immunosuppressive therapy often leads to steroid dependence [2] . The administration of non-steroidal immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, has been used in the past [1] [2] [3] [4] . Nowadays, the use of monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, has given promising results for pediatric refractory AIHA [5] [6] [7] , with sustained remissions in the majority of patients. Nevertheless, potentially life-threatening infections are known to occur with rituximab [7] . In the event of rituximab failure, there is no general consensus or guidelines available indicating precisely how to manage resistant forms of AIHA. Heavy immunosuppression consisting of the combined use of cyclophosphamide and high-dose steroids may be considered [8, 9] .",

Serological evaluations revealed severe anemia (Hb = 2.8g/dL) with a strongly positive direct antiglobulin test and high-titer warm IgG autoantibody. AIHA was diagnosed and steroid therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone at 2mg/kg/day was administered for 5 days (Figure 1 ). An adequate Hb increase was obtained and the child was discharged after 10 days with oral prednisone at 2mg/kg/day. During the subsequent months, several attempts were made to taper off the prednisone, but the patient had developed steroid dependence. Considering this dependence on high steroid doses, a therapeutic course with four doses of rituximab was performed (375mg/m 2 /dose) at weekly intervals ( Figure 1 ). Before rituximab infusion, serum immunoglobulin levels were normal and subpopulation lymphocyte counts were within the normal range. The treatment with rituximab was well tolerated and the patient received intravenous substitutive therapy with commercially available immunoglobulin preparations (400mg/kg, every 3 weeks for 6 months). One month after the end of the first course of rituximab, while still receiving low-dose steroids, the patient presented with a clinical relapse of AIHA, so prednisone was increased to 2mg/kg/day and two further rituximab infusions were performed ( Figure 1 ). After these infusions, B lymphocytes became undetectable and the count returned to normal values 8 months after treatment. The patient remained in clinical remission and free from immunosuppressive drugs for 7 months, before presenting with a further relapse. A more intensive treatment was performed ( Figure 1 ) with cyclophosphamide 10mg/kg/ day for 10 days and methylprednisolone 40mg/kg/day for 5 days, which was tapered over 20 days. Hb level increased and the patient was discharged 10 days later in good clinical condition, without any antifungal or antiviral prophylaxis.",

On day 28, a sudden increase in resistance on the return part of the circuit caused a massive thrombosis in the oxygenator. The entire circuit and the cannula were immediately changed and ECMO restarted within 2 hours. Following the development of pulmonary embolism, the gas exchange rapidly worsened and NOi had to be restarted. An echocardiographic assessment showed right ventricular dilatation, with paradoxical septal wall motion and pulmonary hypertension (systolic pressure 90mmHg). Prostacyclin and sildenafil improved the right heart function and effectively attenuated pulmonary hypertension. In the following days, WBC, ANC and CRP slowly decreased, while pulmonary function improved. Thirty days from ICU admission, ECMO was stopped, the patient rapidly restored her spontaneous ventilatory functions and she was extubated 10 days later. She was finally discharged from the ICU on day 44. At 16-month follow-up, the patient is alive and free from immunosuppressive drugs. At the time of last follow-up, Hb level was 13.5g/dL, reticulocyte count was 11 \u00d7 10 9 /L, with total bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase and haptoglobin all within the normal ranges.",

            "text": "AIHA in children younger than 2 years is in some cases characterized by a resistance to corticosteroids or dependence on high steroid doses and subsequent development of severe side effects [2] . Splenectomy or immunomodulating agents have frequently been used, but there is no consistent demonstration of their efficacy in controlling hemolysis [3] . Immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporine A, or cyclophosphamide, alone or in combination reduce steroid dependence and sometimes control hemolysis [1] [2] [3] [4] . Clinical experience with monoclonal antibodies appears encouraging. In particular, rituximab is increasingly being used off-label, for difficult-to-treat auto-immune diseases and presents the advantage of inducing a selective B-cell depletion, sparing cellular immunity mediated by T cells and natural killer cells. Even though prospective controlled studies are not currently available, the efficacy of rituximab has been shown in pediatric studies. Quartier et al. [5] treated five pediatric refractory AIHA patients, who achieved a complete remission within 15 to 22 months after rituximab therapy. These results were confirmed by Zecca et al. [6] in a group of 15 children treated with rituximab. Four other children were treated by Motto et al. [7] , with the achievement of complete remission. Nevertheless, the prolonged impairment of antibody production leads to an increased risk of viral and bacterial infections. For this reason, monthly intravenous immunoglobulin infusions are recommended for a minimum of 6 months following completion of therapy and prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia is also suggested [7] .",

Clinical remission was achieved for 7 months after which it was possible to interrupt steroid treatment. The pattern of immune reconstitution after rituximab therapy revealed persistently low immunoglobulin levels, partially corrected by the substitutive therapy. Immunoglobulin levels reached their normal range in 18 months and the lymphocyte subpopulations returned to normal range in 16 months. It is, nevertheless, difficult to quantify the real role of rituximab in this heavy immunosuppression, since a combined therapy with high doses of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide was subsequently started. Even though our patient did not present any early side effects related to the rituximab infusions, a prolonged follow-up should be carried out to monitor and prevent long-term side effects of rituximab, which are still unknown.",

            "text": "When our patient relapsed, an alternative treatment was required, since therapies with steroids, rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulins proved to be ineffective. The role of splenectomy in refractory AIHA is still controversial [1] [2] [3] [4] . Although effective vaccinations are available, this surgical treatment should be avoided in children younger than 6 years of age, due to the risk of developing severe bacterial infections. According to local policy, drug-based immunosuppressive therapy is to be preferred. We therefore decided to adopt a combined therapy approach, with high doses of methylprednisolone (40mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days), which was then tapered down over 20 days, and cyclophosphamide (10mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days). This approach appeared to be feasible and encouraging, since we had previously successfully treated two pediatric cases of refractory AIHA with an identical approach [8, 9] . The administration of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide increased the already significant immunodepression which had resulted from prior therapies and further contributed to the severity of the infectious complication presented by our patient that required ECMO therapy. While in the ICU, the patient underwent various ventilatory treatments, some of which are not considered conventional. Modern ventilatory strategy in ARDS aims to provide viable gas exchange with high oxygen concentration and PEEP, while minimizing the injurious effects of mechanical ventilation by using low tidal volume ventilation (6mL/kg) [10] . Although other techniques such as the prone position, NOi and recruitment manoeuvres are effective in improving gas exchange, they did not prove effective in terms of survival [10] . Nevertheless, before ECMO, the only means of providing minimal acceptable oxygenation was to use both NOi and the prone position. Despite using low tidal volumes, a respiratory rate of up to 45 breaths/minute was necessary to obtain acceptable CO 2 levels, and the occurrence of pneumomediastinum demonstrated that we were unable to provide an effective protective ventilatory strategy. Thus, ECMO was the only real means of providing such a strategy, while allowing adequate gas exchange.",

Furthermore, strict clinical monitoring should be carried out, even when no evident symptoms are present.
