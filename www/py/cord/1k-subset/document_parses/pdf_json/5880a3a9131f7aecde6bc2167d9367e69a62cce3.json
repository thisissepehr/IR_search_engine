Non-formal education may therefore take place both within and outside educational institutions, and cater to persons of all ages.

Non-formal education programmes do not necessarily follow the ''ladder'' system, and may have differing durations, and may or may not confer certification of the learning achieved. (p. 47) Some studies report that non-formal education programmes have mixed results (Vermund et al. 2009; Ellis 1995; Evans 1981) . Critics of non-formal education say its effectiveness is too often assumed without proper evaluation, and that untested causal assumptions are frequently made about education and societal change (Benavot 2002) . However, nonformal education serves as an alternative for populations that do not have readily available and accessible educational options (UNESCO 2006) . Globally, non-formal educators have addressed sexually transmitted infections (STI), especially in settings with limited resources (Latkin et al. 2009; Shah et al. 2007; Akani and Erhabor 2006) . For example, in a randomly controlled HIV prevention trial, researchers observed improvements in service delivery, including referrals for HIV testing and provision of condoms, when non-formal care providers received enhanced training in HIV case management (Shah et al. 2007) . Peer education, anti-AIDS clubs, drama, art, youth dialogues, music, and comic books are some examples of non-formal education. Non-formal educational activities were a key determinant in the tremendous decline in HIV prevalence in Uganda, where the Ministry of Education and Sports introduced national-level prevention campaigns in 1986 (Jacob et al. 2006) . These activities included media messages targeting youth and school theatrical performances that depicted real-life scenarios facing youth. Plays were presented in over 8,500 primary schools nationwide, also reaching a large proportion of out-of-school youth.

Ever since the first AIDS case was reported in 1984, the prevalence among adults there has remained under 0.1%, according to the national Department of Health (Philippines DOH 2005) . From 1984 to 2009, the total number of reported cases was 3,654 (Philippines DOH 2009), but this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting, as the United Nations estimates 6,000-11,000 cases (UNAIDS 2008). Table 1 shows the annual number of HIV and AIDS cases with combined numbers for 1984 to 2004, and annual numbers by major routes of transmission from 2005 to January 2009. Heterosexuals account for the highest number of cases in the Philippines; the second highest risk group is men who have sex with men (MSM)/bisexuals. The number of heterosexual transmissions has remained fairly stable during this period (about 137 new cases per year), but we see a significant and annually rising increase among MSM and bisexuals. According to the National Epidemiology Center at the Department of Health, 65 new HIV cases were reported in January 2009. This is the highest number ever reported in a month in the Philippines, and represents a 63% increase over the 40 cases reported in January 2008. Young people aged 15-24 are the age group most vulnerable to HIV infection in the Philippines (Alesna-Llanto and Raymundo 2005) , and sexual contact (at 89%) is the leading mode of transmission (Philippines DOH 2009).

According to Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura 1987) , behaviour change is enhanced when individuals are trained to exercize influence over their own behaviours and their social environment. They can best make such changes when they experience interventions to heighten their awareness and knowledge, along with enhanced resources and social support. Bandura conceptualized the basic elements of social cognitive theory as consisting of personal determinants in the form of cognitive, affective, and biological factors, behaviour and the environment. In this article we examine how various programmes have applied this theoretical framework to behaviours related to HIV/AIDS, by exposing participants to interventions designed not only to promote safer sex guidelines, but also to develop individual skills and self-beliefs that would enable them to reduce risks in the face of counteracting influences (Bandura 2004) . The second theoretical framework used in this research combines power and social influence. The social psychological study of power and influence originated in the groundbreaking work of Kurt Lewin (1941) , who considered power to be the possibility of inducing force on someone else. More formally, it is the maximum force that Person A can place on Person B divided by the maximum resistance that B can offer. French and Raven (1959) further developed this conceptualization of power and social influence; they defined influence as a force one person (the agent) exerts on someone else (the target) to induce a change in the target, including changes in behaviours, opinions, attitudes, goals, needs, and values. Social power was later defined as the potential ability of an agent to influence a target. Raven (1965) further classified power according to the base from which it comes and listed six types: reward, coercive, legitimate, referent, expert and informational power.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 110, "end": 124, "text": "(Bandura 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 975, "end": 989, "text": "(Bandura 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1196, "text": "Lewin (1941)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1427, "text": "French and Raven (1959)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1810, "text": "Raven (1965)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Theoretical framework"}, {"text": "For this study, data from Taiwan were collected from several major sources, including official HIV/AIDS surveillance statistics and the national strategic plan from the website of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control, annual reports of prevention and education activities to the AIDS Prevention and Control Committee from 2005 to 2008, educational activities among correctional institutions provided by the AIDS NGOs, and a literature review.

Needles and syringes are very easy to purchase in Taiwan, even without needle syringe programmes. Hence, non-formal education was also a key factor in this success. The rapid increase in the HIV epidemic caused greater media attention and increased reporting. Also, over 60% of the new reports of infections were among the incarcerated population and resulted from mandatory HIV testing.
