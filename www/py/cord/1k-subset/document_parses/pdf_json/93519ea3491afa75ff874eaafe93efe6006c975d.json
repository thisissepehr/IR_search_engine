Data analysis suggests that patients with chronic diseases, obese patients, and pregnant women are more liable to develop severe H1N1 influenza. After initial infection by the virus, the host innate immune system, as a first line of defense, takes protective measures earlier than the adaptive immune system to avoid further viral invasion or replication [1] . Animal experiments indicated that when the swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) infected early hosts, it elicited strong CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD4 + CD25 + T cell reactions [2] . CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are related to viral immunity and the lack of these cells would lead to a delay in viral clearance and an increase in mortality [3] [4] [5] . On the other hand, CD4 + CD25 + cells are T cell subsets with an immune inhibition function and could play an important regulatory role in a variety of infectious diseases [6] [7] [8] .
