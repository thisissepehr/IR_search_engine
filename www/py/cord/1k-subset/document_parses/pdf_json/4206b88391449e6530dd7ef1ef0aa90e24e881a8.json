There is no gold standard for diagnosing microbial infection as clinical and laboratory signs are neither sensitive nor specific enough, and microbiological studies often remain negative. The presence of a new infiltrate on plain chest radiograph is considered indicative for diagnosing pneumonia, especially when is supported by clinical and laboratory findings. However it is difficult to differentiate a chest infiltrate of bacterial origin from a chest infiltrate of non-bacterial origin solely based on radiological criteria [1] . The diagnosis of infection is not always clear in the acute setting in patients with respiratory tract disease and a surrogate marker of infection would be a major benefit in the diagnostic armamentarium.

More precisely, infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Sthaphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were accompanied by greater levels of sTREM-1 and by greater expression of TREM-1 on neutrophils than infections caused by other pathogens. Although it may be hypothesized that Gram-positive cocci and H. influenzae are strong inducers of TREM-1 expression, it should be emphasized that TREM-1 is one PRR, the exact agonist of which remains to be found [29, 31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 738, "end": 742, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 743, "end": 746, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A former study of our group [29] and another by Gibot et al [22] in heterogeneous populations of patients with severe sepsis of diverse aetiology investigated the role of early assessment of sTREM-1 as a determinant of final outcome.

Concentrations of sTREM-1 in serum are particularly increased in CAP caused by Gram-positive cocci and Haemophilus species. The real clinical value of sTREM-1 assay comes when TREM-1 levels are low, allowing the clinician to withhold empiric antibiotics until culture results are available, and thus eliminating unnecessary antibiotic exposure to the patient. And finally, early serum levels of sTREM-1 greater than 180 pg/ml in CAP are associated with unfavourable prognosis. and Evangelos J. Giamarellos-Bourboulis Ass.
