ALI/ARDS is characterized clinically by sudden respiratory failure with impaired oxygenation and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema [2] .

Interestingly, recent studies suggest that in injured lungs, IL8 in humans and KC in mice form immune complexes with autoantibodies, and these immune complexes can in turn bind Fc receptors such as Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIII that amplify the inflammatory response [21, 22] .

Male C57BL/6 mice (\"B6\") and mice carrying a spontaneous mutation in the Fas gene that impairs Fas signaling (B6. MRL-Fas lpr /J, \"lpr\") were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories and studied at 7-13 weeks of age. Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with 5% inhaled isoflurane and then intubated endotracheally with a 20-gauge angiocatheter. Placement of the catheter in the trachea was verified by visualizing the movement of a 100 \u03bcl bubble of water in response to respiratory efforts. After confirming intubation, the trachea was instilled with either E. coli LPS, 15 ng/kg or PBS. The instillate was suspended in 2.5% colloidal carbon to allow later confirmation of the extent and distribution of the instillation macro and microscopically. After the installations some of the mice were extubated, returned to their cages, and allowed free access to food and water; other mice where kept intubated and subjected to mechanical ventilation with the following settings: tidal volume (Tv) 10 ml/kg; respiratory rate (RR) 150 breaths/minute; fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) 0.21; and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3 cm H 2 O. The heart rate, airway pressures, rectal temperatures and EtCO 2 were monitored continuously using a computerized monitoring system (Chart 4, AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). The RR was adjusted to maintain the EtCO 2 between 30 -40 mmHg. The body temperature was maintained between 37 and 38\u00b0C with external heating. The mice were hydrated with a continuous intraperitoneal infusion of lactated ringer solution at 500 \u03bcl/hour. Muscle relaxation was attained with pancuronium bromide, 1 \u03bcg/g i.p followed by 0.5 \u03bcg/g i.p. every hour. After four hours of mechanical ventilation the mice were euthanized with 0.30 ml/kg i.p. of Beuthanasia-D (Schering-Plough Animal Health, Union, NJ). The thorax was rapidly opened and the mouse was exsanguinated by direct cardiac puncture. The left lung was removed and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The right lung was lavaged with 0.6 mM EDTA in PBS; an aliquot of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was removed for cell counts and differentials, the remaining fluid was spun at 1200 x g, and the supernatants stored at -80\u00b0C in individual aliquots. Following the BAL, the right lung was fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde at an inflation pressure of 15 cm H 2 O for histological evaluation.",

Measurement of anti-KC:KC complexes in the BALF revealed an increase in B6 mice treated with MV + LPS, which was not seen in the lpr mice (Figure 7) We also used immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy to investigate if there were differences in the deposition of anti-KC:KC complexes in ventilated B6 and lpr mice. The alveolar walls of the ventilated B6 mice contained abundant leukocytes, identified based on Gr-1 positivity ( Figure 8 ). The leukocytes expressed the receptor Fc\u03b3RIII on their membrane surface. KC co-localized with the Fc\u03b3RIII receptors. In contrast, there were, in general, Caspase-3 activity was significantly higher in the lpr mice exposed to MV + LPS. n = at least 6/group. Double-labeling for TUNEL (green) and cytokeratin (red) reveals that the TUNEL positive cells are located in the alveolar wall, but most of them are cytokeratin negative.",

The main finding was that a functional Fas/FasL system was required for neutrophil migration into the airspaces of the lungs of mechanically ventilated mice exposed to LPS. The changes in BAL neutrophils seen in this study were associated with changes in lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and because lung MPO activity is a measurement of the total content of neutrophils in the lungs, the data suggests that the Fas/FasL system is required for both neutrophil migration into the airspaces and for neutrophil recruitment into the lungs. This observation confirms other studies that suggest a key role for the Fas/FasL system in neutrophil migration into the airspaces; for example, activation of Fas in the lungs of mice and rabbits results in a neutrophilic alveolitis (1, 2) , whereas pharmacologic blockade of the Fas/FasL system attenuates the neutrophilic response to bacteria and bacterial products (3) (4) (5) (6) . Tissue respons. C57BL/6 or Fas-deficient lpr mice were exposed to either intratracheal installations of PBS followed by spontaneous breathing or to intratracheal installation of LPS, 15 ng/kg, followed by four hours of mechanical ventilation (MV) with tidal volumes of 10 mL per kilogram. Lung tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to demonstrate the pattern of injury. The instillate contained 2.5% colloidal carbon to identify the instilled areas. Spontaneously breathing mice instilled with PBS showed normal lung architecture, regardless of strain (A, C). The B6 mice exposed to MV and LPS showed intra-alveolar and interstitial neutrophilic infiltrates, as well as thickening of the alveolar walls and occasional fibrin deposition (B).",

            "text": "Another potential mechanism that would explain differences in neutrophil migration with similar concentrations of soluble KC is a difference in neutrophil chemotaxis of lpr and B6 neutrophils. However, our chemotaxis studied showed that, if anything, neutrophils from lpr mice have slightly increased chemotaxis to KC, strongly suggesting that differences in chemotaxis are not the reason for the attenuation in the neutrophilic response seen in the lpr mice. Neutrophil recruitment and migration appears to be partly dependent on the formation of anti-KC:KC immune complexes, which can bind Fc\u03b3 receptors in local leukocytes, enhancing the inflammatory response [22] . For example, the generation of anti-KC:KC immune complexes in the lungs of mice is followed by acute inflammatory lung injury, and this injury requires the presence of Fc\u03b3 receptors [21] . Furthermore, mice lacking \u03b3 chains show attenuated injury in response to LPS, suggesting that this process is relevant for inflammation secondary to bacterial products [21] . The human equivalent of anti-KC:KC complexes are anti-IL8:IL8 complexes, and these are present in the lungs of patients with ARDS [25, 26] . In our study, we found that there are less anti-KC:KC complexes in the lungs of the lpr mice, even though the concentrations of KC were similar to those in the B6 mice. Thus, it is possible that the lower numbers of neutrophils seen in the lpr mice were due to decreased formation and deposition of anti-KC:KC complexes in the lungs. Additional studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis, and it remains possible that differences in other unmeasured chemotactic agents account for the differences in neutrophil recruitment. The mechanism linking the Fas/FasL system with impaired formation and deposition of immune complexes remains unclear. To date, lpr mice, particularly the MRL/ lpr strain are known to generate autoantibodies that can result in a lupus-like syndrome [27] .",
