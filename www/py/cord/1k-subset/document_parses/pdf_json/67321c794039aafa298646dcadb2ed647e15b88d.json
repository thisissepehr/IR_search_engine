Although our study data cannot explain the high mortality rates associated with sepsis, it is likely that insufficient early sepsis care may have contributed. Delayed presentation of sepsis patients to the hospital, and subsequently to the ICU, is common [14] . The paucity of resources to manage patients with sepsis (e.g. insufficient amounts of fluids, unavailability of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and unavailability/unreliability of microbiological diagnostics) may have prevented adequate sepsis management at the study ICU. Recently, an expert group published guidelines to help resource poor settings manage critically ill patients with sepsis [15] . The recommendations have been well received in a number of resource limited countries. The patient population included in this study is younger compared with patients admitted to ICUs in industrialised countries [16] . However, our findings are similar to those reported from surveys of critically ill patients treated in other African countries, where life expectancy is comparably low to that of Uganda [5] . Similarly, the mean length of ICU stay in this study resembled that in other parts of Africa. The finding that patients who stayed 6 to 15 days in the ICU experienced better survival to discharge than those treated for less than 5 days or longer than 2 weeks indicates that patients in the study ICU typically die early (within a few days) or relatively late (after 2 weeks). Early deaths can most likely be explained by the lack of trained staff and resources to provide adequate care for critically ill patients with a high disease severity (e.g. those with brain trauma, shock or sepsis).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 126, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 127, "end": 130, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 131, "end": 134, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 392, "end": 396, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 800, "end": 804, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1023, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1215, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Children accounted for 11% of all ICU admissions with a mortality rate of 40%. This is similar to other African country ICUs [17, 18] , but considerably higher than in industrialised countries [19] . The lack of ventilators and accompanying resources in the paediatric high dependency unit at the Mulago hospital is one of the main reasons why children are admitted to the study ICU. Although our study cannot prove a causal relationship, it is likely that delayed initiation of mechanical ventilation and aggressive resuscitation could explain the high death rate in the paediatric patients in the study population There was a higher mortality in the paediatric medical group than in the surgical group, and we hypothesise that this is because a lot of the post-operative patients were elective surgical patients who were admitted for observation. Most paediatric referrals were, and continue to be, children with acute respiratory failure who are transferred from the paediatric high dependency unit because they are in need of mechanical ventilation. The relatively younger population in LICs and the fact that respiratory illness is the leading cause of deaths in under-5-year olds in such countries [20] , implies that more emphasis should be placed on strengthening paediatric critical care resources in LICs. Previous studies have suggested the need to estimate the cost effectiveness of critical care in this setting, given the relatively younger and economically active population. [1, 2] The fact that HIV is endemic in Uganda explains why HIV/AIDS was one of the most common reasons for admission in the study population. Due to the advent of easily accessible highly active anti-retroviral therapy, together with septrin prophylaxis, the incidence of HIVrelated diseases (such as pulmonary infection with Pneumocystis jiroveci, which usually presents as acute respiratory failure) has markedly decreased [21, 22] . In this survey, it was difficult to retrospectively determine from the medical records whether acute respiratory failure was due to infection or other causes. We could, however, determine that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was a very rare cause of acute respiratory failure in our setting. Other rare HIV-related causes of ICU admission were viral encephalitis and liver failure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 193, "end": 197, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1494, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1497, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1920, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1924, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Obstetric admissions in our study were largely due to perioperative cardiac arrest occurring as a consequence of peripartum haemorrhage, eclampsia and/or sepsis.

According to anecdotal evidence, 99% of all admissions are mechanically ventilated; however, the lack of data to support this precludes us stating this as a fact.

The mortality rate stayed the same over time, possibly because the admitting doctors stuck to their prognoses, and there are limitations in resources and a paucity of use of evidence-based practice. The fact that half the patients came from outside of the capital city is explained by the dearth of ICU beds in the country as a whole. Critical care remains a neglected area of health service delivery in this setting, with large numbers of patients with potentially treatable conditions not having access to such services. Further research needs to be carried out in ICUs in other resource limited settings, including a prospective study to estimate the resources required to design resource appropriate units in such
