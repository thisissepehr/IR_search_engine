            "text": "Mammalian sperm become fertile after completing capacitation, a process associated with cholesterol loss and changes in the biophysical properties of the sperm membranes that prepares the sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. Different laboratories have hypothesized that cholesterol efflux can influence the extent and/or movement of lipid raft microdomains. In a previous study, our laboratory investigated the identity of sperm proteins putatively associated with rafts. After extraction with Triton X-100 and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, proteins distributing to the light buoyant-density fractions were cored from polyacrylamide gels and microsequenced. In this study, a subset of these proteins (TEX101, basigin, hexokinase 1, facilitated glucose transporter 3, IZUMO, and SPAM1) and other molecules known to be enriched in membrane rafts (caveolin 2, flotillin 1, flotillin 2, and the ganglioside GM3) were selected to investigate their localization in the sperm and their behavior during capacitation and the acrosome reaction. These molecules localize to multiple sperm domains, including the acrosomal cap (IZUMO, caveolin 2, and flotillin 2), equatorial segment (GM3), cytoplasmic droplet (TEX101), midpiece (basigin, facilitated glucose transporter 3, and flotillin 2), and principal piece (facilitated glucose transporter 3). Some of these markers modified their immunofluorescence pattern after sperm incubation under capacitating conditions, and these changes correlated with the occurrence of the acrosome reaction. While GM3 and caveolin 2 were not detected after the acrosome reaction, flotillin 2 was found in the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm, and IZUMO distributed along the sperm head, reaching the post-and para-acrosomal areas. Taking into consideration the requirement of the acrosome reaction for sperm to become fusogenic, these results suggest that membrane raft dynamics may have a role in sperm-egg membrane interaction.",

These processes start in the male reproductive tract with epididymal maturation and continue in the female tract, where sperm undergo capacitation and become fully able to fertilize an oocyte [1, 2] . Molecular events implicated in the initiation of capacitation include lipid rearrangements in the sperm plasma membrane that are coupled to changes in ion fluxes and to several signaling cascades. Among the changes in lipids, capacitation has long been thought to involve loss of cholesterol, leading to a different organization of the sperm plasma membrane.",

            "text": "The release of cholesterol appears to be necessary for the signaling events that accompany capacitation [3] [4] [5] , including the preparation of the sperm to undergo an agonist-induced acrosome reaction. However, our understanding of how sterol efflux couples to the regulation of signal transduction pathways intrinsic to capacitation remains rudimentary. Years after the description of the plasma membrane fluid mosaic model [6] , specialized platforms clustering signaling molecules were identified [7] . These structures are highly enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids; this lipid composition provides their characteristic biochemical properties (insolubility in nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 at 48C and light buoyant density after centrifugation in a sucrose gradient). Although several limitations should be taken into account [8] , sucrose light buoyant detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) have been widely used as a first approach to identify membrane rafts [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Current concepts attribute important signaling properties to the existence of membrane rafts acting to bring protein assemblies together [16] [17] [18] . In the case of mammalian sperm, it has been hypothesized that cholesterol release during capacitation modifies the function/location of proteins in sperm raft microdomains [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms by which the release of cholesterol couples to signaling events in the sperm, we previously conducted a proteomic analysis of the sperm light buoyant fractions and identified a number of proteins, including hexokinase 1 (HK1), testis serine proteases 1 and 2, TEX101, hyaluronidase (SPAM1), facilitated glucose transporter 3 (SLC2A3), lactate dehydrogenase A, carbonic anhydrase IV, IZUMO, pantophysin, basigin (BSG), and CRISP1 [20] .",

In intact sperm, the plasma membrane on the head surrounds the anterior acrosome, the equatorial segment, and the postacrosomal region. In the tail, the membrane covers the anterior part of the flagellum (midpiece) containing the mitochondria and the posterior portion of the tail (principal piece) containing the fibrous sheath surrounding the outer dense fibers [25] . These sperm compartments should be taken into account when the role of DRM proteins is analyzed; therefore, in this study we used antibodies against a subset of these proteins to investigate their localization in mouse sperm and their behavior during capacitation. Using filipin staining, the cholesterol-rich regions have been mapped to the plasma membrane overlaying the acrosome [5, 26, 27] . However, our findings indicate that proteins present in the light buoyant fractions, as well as other molecules known to distribute dynamically in membrane rafts, localized in multiple sperm compartments, including the anterior head, equatorial segment, cytoplasmic droplet, midpiece, and principal piece. When the behavior of these molecules during capacitation was studied, no changes were found in the tail-resident proteins. On the other hand, while some of the molecules in the head were lost, others change their immunofluorescence pattern; these changes were observed only in sperm that had undergone acrosomal exocytosis. IZUMO, present exclusively in the acrosomal region in intact sperm, spread to the post-and para-acrosomal regions of the sperm head in acrosome-reacted cells, while flotillin 2 (FLOT2), originally in the dorsal acrosome and midpiece, appeared in the equatorial segment. Considering that sperm acquire fusogenic capacity after the acrosome reaction, these changes in DRM-associated proteins could indicate their involvement in sperm-egg interaction.",

Recently, fluorescently labeled cholera toxin has been used to address the presence of GM1 in sperm from different mammalian species [19, 21, 23, [30] [31] [32] [33] . Although GM1 is the best studied in sperm, other gangliosides are known to be enriched in membrane rafts [34] , and differential ganglioside distribution among these membrane microdomains has been reported [35] [36] [37] . In particular, GM3 appears to be the major ganglioside in the male reproductive system [38] , and several studies [39] [40] [41] demonstrate its abundance in bovine, ovine, and human sperm. However, localization of GM3 on sperm has not yet been analyzed, to our knowledge. To investigate the location of GM3 in mouse sperm, a specific anti-GM3 antibody was tested by immunofluorescence. This monoclonal antibody has been validated by Kotani et al. [42, 43] and was used in several studies [35, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .

Previous work from our group has used a proteomic analysis of low-density DRM-resident proteins in an effort to investigate whether cholesterol efflux regulates membrane rafts during sperm capacitation [20] . The use of detergent to relate protein association to rafts is the most widely used method to analyze the composition of membrane rafts and to identify putative resident proteins [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, this procedure has been questioned on the basis that detergent can induce the formation of membrane domains and fails to provide physiologically relevant information [8, 14] . Despite these criticisms, detergent separation can still be considered a first approach to determining components of membrane rafts. In particular, although proteins not belonging to rafts could be found in the low-density DRM fractions, it is FIG. 5.

Mouse sperm incubated under capacitating conditions were analyzed by immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods using anti-GM3, anti-CAV2, anti-IZUMO, and anti-FLOT2, followed by the respective Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were also stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated PNA to relate the staining patterns to the acrosomal status. Sperm that underwent the acrosome reaction correspond to those showing the new staining patterns (arrowheads). Experiments were repeated at least three times; representative sperm are shown.

The sphingoid long-chain base is linked to a fatty acid molecule via an amide bond-forming ceramide. The addition of carbohydrates to this ceramide backbone leads to the formation of a great diversity of glycosphingolipids, including the gangliosides GM1 and GM3 that differ only in their oligosaccharide chains. Like cholesterol, sphingolipids are found to be enriched in membrane rafts; this behavior is due to the presence of two long saturated alkyl chains that can be organized and condensed by sterols to form the liquid-ordered phase of membrane rafts [49] . In sperm, other investigations on nonprotein raft markers have focused on GM1. Using cholera toxin, this ganglioside was shown to localize to the plasma membrane overlaying the acrosome in living sperm [32] . On the other hand, using biochemical methods, it has been demonstrated by biochemical methods that GM3 is the most abundant ganglioside in the male reproductive tract and in sperm [39] [40] [41] ; however, localization of GM3 in these cells was undetermined. In this study, we used previously validated antibodies against GM3 [42, 43] to determine the immunofluorescence pattern of this ganglioside in sperm and found it to be restricted to the equatorial segment.",

            "text": "Considering the method used in our original study [20] , the source of the proteins located in the light-density fractions could belong to more than one membrane. In addition to the aforementioned sperm compartments (e.g., head and tail), the subcellular structure of the sperm encompasses different membranes, including the plasma membrane, outer acrosomal and inner acrosomal membranes, and nuclear and mitochondrial membranes. Although results obtained from the proteomic analysis suggested the absence of mitochondria and nuclear membranes in the sperm light-density fractions, DRM proteins coming from the inner and outer acrosomal membranes were also found in these fractions. The results of this study are in agreement with this possibility and with the assorted origin of plasma membranes contributing to the light-density fractions. In the tail, localization of BSG, SLC2A3, and FLOT2 suggests that DRM can be found along the different sections comprising the sperm flagella. The results in this study provide some other insightful clues for the sperm head. IZUMO cannot be detected on live sperm and is only exposed when plasma membrane integrity is disrupted by freezing, permeabilization, or the acrosome reaction [50, 51] ; accordingly, it is hypothesized that this protein localizes to the inner acrosomal membrane. In this respect, the association of IZUMO with the light-density fraction provides evidence that the inner acrosomal membrane contributes to the total light buoyant DRM fractions. Even an ephemeral structure like the cytoplasmic droplet seems to preserve DRMs, as suggested by the highly restricted location of TEX101 in the light-density fractions and by the results of the immunofluorescence studies. These results confirm studies [37, 49] supporting the heterogeneity of DRMs with regard to their protein and lipid composition.",

The acrosome reaction involves an extensive reorganization of the membranes located in the anterior head of the sperm cell. Multiple fusion points between the plasma and outer acrosomal membranes induce a fenestration process during which the components originally located in the apical portion of the sperm are lost [1] . After fusion, the inner acrosomal and plasma membranes become continuous, assembling a new sperm surface resulting from the mixing of their respective components. Caveolin 2, originally found in the anterior head of the sperm, could not be detected after the acrosome reaction, suggesting that this antigen is likely located at the plasma membrane covering the acrosomal cap and is consequently lost during exocytosis. In the case of GM3, although no signal was found on reacted sperm, the original localization of this ganglioside did not predict this behavior because the equatorial segment is excluded from the vesiculization process that takes place during the acrosome reaction [1] . Although the possible loss of GM3 cannot be ruled out, considering that anti-GM3 recognizes the glycoside portion of the GM3 molecule [42] , the lack of signal of acrosome-reacted sperm could also be due to the removal of the respective epitope by acrosomal glycosidases released during exocytosis [1] .",

In intact sperm, IZUMO was restricted to the dorsal portion of the sperm head; after the acrosome reaction, it distributed to a new region opposite to the anterior acrosome, including part of the postacrosomal region. Different IZUMO staining patterns have been previously observed [50] , but their connection with antigen relocation due to the acrosome reaction has not been analyzed in detail. Concerning FLOT2, the staining formerly observed in the midpiece did not change with the acrosome reaction, but the signal located in the apical portion of the head extended along the acrosomal domain, revealing the presence of FLOT2 in the equatorial segment in cells that underwent the acrosome reaction. In addition to FLOT2, several proteins that have been reported to relocate after the acrosome reaction such as SPAM1, CRISP1, and IZUMO are present in the light buoyant DRM fractions [51] [52] [53] . This common feature suggests that changes in localization could be related to these membrane substructures rather than to a specific aspect of the individual proteins.",

While FLOT2 is restricted to the equatorial segment, IZUMO can move farther, crossing to the ventral para-acrosomal sperm domains. These compartments are separated by a specialized structure that seems to be defined during epididymal maturation and involves tyrosine phosporylation [54] . Other proteins reported to redistribute after the acrosome reaction are localized to the equatorial segment and are not able to pass the postacrosomal boundary [52, 53] . This suggests that protein redistribution after the acrosome reaction is a regulated process that may comprise a particular mechanism for IZUMO. It is a matter to be resolved why only IZUMO among all the proteins that move after the acrosome reaction is able to cross the postacrosomal boundary and whether this has a functional significance considering its relevance in sperm-egg fusion [55] .",

Although IZUMO has been shown to be necessary for sperm-egg fusion [55] , the molecular mechanisms conferring fusogenic ability to sperm are not well understood. Membrane microdomains and their resident molecules have been implicated in processes requiring cell-cell fusion such as invasion [56, 57] . With respect to the molecules depicting a different inmmunofluorescence pattern after the acrosome reaction, while FLOT2 has been positively correlated with metastatic processes [58] , GM3 has been negatively associated with cell motility and invasiveness [59] . In the sperm, we can speculate that the presence of GM3 is associated with a nonfunctional equatorial segment and that GM3 modification or loss may be needed for the sperm to acquire the ability to fuse with the egg. Taking into consideration that IZUMO has a direct role in sperm-egg fusion as suggested by the null mutant phenotype [55] , the putative participation of those regions where IZUMO localized after the acrosome reaction in sperm-egg fusion should be reanalyzed.",
