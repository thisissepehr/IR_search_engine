Secondly, the high mutation rates we are likely to encounter complicate the inference of a reliable alignment of genomes. To address these issues, we develop a model that explicitly models selection in overlapping reading frames. We then integrate this model into a statistical alignment framework, enabling us to estimate selection while explicitly dealing with the uncertainty of individual alignments. We show that in this way we obtain un-biased selection parameters for different genomic regions of interest, and can improve in accuracy compared to using a fixed alignment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "We run a series of simulation studies to gauge how well we do in selection estimation, especially in comparison to the use of a fixed alignment.

We thus, as shown, partition the genome into five segments, making a split wherever a gene starts or stops. These five segments we then assign to be of one of three region-types: non-, single-and double coding. When considering the effect a mutation of the indicated nucleotide C in the overlapping region of S 1 might have, we must consider its coding role in both reading frames. In GRF1 it is in the third position of the codon AGC and in GRF2 in the second position of the codon GCT. In the genetic code the codon AGx codes for serine or argenine, depending on whether x is a purine or a pyrimidine, respectively. On the other hand GxT codes for four different amino acids, depending on the nature of x. Therefore a transition in the nucleotide C will have no effect on the amino acid encoded by GRF1, whereas a transversion will. In GRF2 on the other hand, both will result in a non-synonymous substitution.
