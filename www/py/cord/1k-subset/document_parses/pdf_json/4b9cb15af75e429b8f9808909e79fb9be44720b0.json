variables, and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for continuous variables. For both seasons, the pandemic influenza mortality rate per 100, 000 persons was calculated as the number of fatal pandemic influenza cases divided by the total Dutch population (determined on 1 January 2009 and 2010) * 100, 000. For this analysis, the patients were categorised in the following age groups:0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, ..., 75-84 and \u2265 85 years of age. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute).
