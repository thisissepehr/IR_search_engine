Although the use of oxygen may be clinically indicated in hypoxemic situations, one must consider the potential longterm toxic side effects. For example, we know that oxygen creates cellular damage by a variety of mechanisms. Normal cellular metabolism of oxygen involves the transfer of electrons from NADH to O 2 molecules to form water (H 2 O). At normal partial pressure, 95% of oxygen molecules (O 2 ) are reduced to H 2 O and 5% are partially reduced to toxic byproducts by normal metabolism in the mitochondria [5] . These metabolites include the superoxide anion (O 2 -), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and hydroxyl radicals ( \u2022 OH) all of which make up what are known as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) [6] . Exposure to conditions of hyperoxia as well as ionizing radiation (IR) leads to increased amounts of these ROS and their damaging effects.",

Lipids, including pulmonary surfactant, react with ROS to produce lipid peroxides, which cause increased membrane permeability, inactivation of surfactant, and inhibition of normal cellular enzyme processes. Proteins reacting with ROS result in decreased protein synthesis due to inhibition of ribosomal translation or destruction of formed proteins. This ultimately leads to inactivation of intracellular enzymes and transport proteins resulting in impaired cellular metabolism and accumulation of cellular waste products. Lastly, ROS cause damage to nucleic acids by leading to modified purine and pyrimidine bases, apurinic (AP) / apyrimidinic sites, and DNA protein cross-links which can lead to single strand breaks [8] .",

Damaged bases are excised and replaced in a multi-step process. Lesion-specific DNA glycosylase repair genes initiate this process. After removal of the damaged base, the resulting AP site is cleaved by APendonuclease generating a 3'OH and 5'deoxyribose phosphate (dRP). \u03b2-polymerase, which possesses dRPase activity, cleaves the dRP residue generating a nucleotide gap and then fills in this single nucleotide gap.

The repair enzyme hOgg1 is a purine oxidation glycosylase that recognizes and excise 8-oxoguanine lesions (GO) paired with cytosine. GO can pair with both cytosine and adenine during DNA replication [15] . If repair of C/GO does not occur, then G:C to T:A transversions may result [5, [15] [16] [17] . The repair enzyme hMYH is an 8-oxoguanine mismatch glycosylase that removes adenines misincorporated opposite 8-oxoG lesions that arise through DNA replication errors [5, [18] [19] [20] . The repair enzyme hMTH hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates such as 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-GTP, 8-oxo-dATP, and 2-hydroxy-dATP, effectively removing them from the nucleotide pool and preventing their incorporation into DNA ( Figure 1B ) [21] . Lastly, the repair gene endonuclease III (hNTH) is a pyrimidine oxidation and hydration glycosylase that recognizes a wide range of damaged pyrimidines [22] . hNTH has also been shown to have a similar DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity that can remove 8-oxoG from 8-oxoG/G, 8-oxoG/A, and 8-oxoG/C mispairs [23, 24] . Subsequent steps following hNTH are identical to those following hOgg1 ( Figure 1A ).",

Analysis of our growth curves after exposure to H 2 O 2 in comparison to hyperoxia and IR clearly indicates that cellular protection by oxidative DNA repair genes is specific to the agent used. Because no protection was observed with over-expression of any of the repair genes following exposure to H 2 O 2 , we speculate that the damage it causes is dissimilar. It may be that its damage not only involves oxidized bases, but may also include other forms of DNA, lipid, and protein damage that are not corrected by oxidative DNA repair genes.

We determined that survival of A549 cells was also enhanced to a small degree with increased expression of the repair enzyme hMYH. This was an unexpected finding as we anticipated the repair gene hOgg1 would demonstrate the greatest protection in response to oxidative stress based on previous studies, however these experiments utilized the colony forming assay (CFA) to detect improvements in survival [25] . Additionally, the CFA may provide different results compared to the SRB assay, which allows for growth analysis over a shorter window of time.

Cells over-expressing the repair enzyme hMYH clearly grow at a slower rate when compared with the other enzymes. The mechanism behind this is not understood at this point in time. The repair action of Cell growth curve and associated doubling times (DT) Figure 6 Cell growth curve and associated doubling times (DT hMYH is known to remove adenines misincorporated opposite 8-oxoG lesions. This lesion occurs when a C/GO lesion is allowed to replicate before being corrected by hOgg1. Repair by hMYH is not a final corrective measure. The product of hMYH activity is the lesion C/GO, which allows hOgg1 to have another opportunity to remove 8-oxoG opposite cytosine. We know that A549 cells possess the hOgg1 gene based on a previous study demonstrating the presence of this gene after amplification by genomic PCR [45] . We also have demonstrated endogenous activity of hOgg1 in A549 cells by using an 8-oxoguanine bioactivity assay. Therefore, our explanation of these results is that the slowed growth created by hMYH may provide a wider window of opportunity for the repair process to take place, which ultimately grants endogenous hOgg1 another opportunity to remove the 8-oxoG lesion created by oxidative stress.",

The A549 cell line has not demonstrated somatic mutations in hMYH, but a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) has been noted [45] . The impact on function by this SNP is unknown. It would appear that the function of hMYH is very important in preventing somatic mutations leading to cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. Although studies to date have not demonstrated this same relationship with lung cancer, we do know that the lungs are subjected to large quantities of ROS under certain conditions as discussed earlier. The formation of mutations from oxidative stress does have other deleterious effects on cells including cellular death by necrosis and apoptosis.

It has also previously been reported that treatment of A549 cells with sodium dichromate, a prooxidant, leads to a reduction of hOgg1 protein expression that was not observed with H 2 O 2 [49] . One additional study demonstrated a dose dependent down regulation of hOgg1 protein expression in rat lung after exposure to cadmium, a known carcinogen associated with the formation of intracellular ROS [50] . In our experiments we were able to demonstrate that both hyperoxia and IR do not appear to impact the endogenous expression of hOgg1, hMYH, and hMTH at 24 and 48 hours following exposure. It was noted that endogenous hNTH was reduced after hyperoxia at 24 and 48 hours after the onset of exposure. One would speculate that this reduction in endogenous hNTH secondary to hyperoxia is related to either decreased production or increased destruction in response to O 2 exposure. Over-expression of this repair enzyme did not result in improvements in survival after O 2 exposure based on our experiments. It may be that endogenous levels are adequate to correct this specific mutational burden for these experiments.",

This is an important finding for interpretation of survival data; protection of cells is due to the overexpression of the specific gene and not due to enhancement of other endogenous repair enzyme levels, at least for the genes studied under these conditions. Some limitations may exist in using a lung carcinoma cellline, which likely differs both in proliferative properties as well as in response to oxidative stress in comparison to primary epithelial cells. The enhanced cell growth observed with cell lines may be more reflective of undifferentiated alveolar type II cells which are likely to replace terminally differentiated alveolar type I cells after injury/ death due to oxidative stress.

Lastly, we demonstrated that over-expression does not lead to altered endogenous expression of these repair genes. As the understanding of DNA repair mechanisms continues to grow and the evolution of gene therapy takes place, more treatment options may be available in the clinical setting to help with many disease processes including the damaging effects of oxygen and its metabolites.",
