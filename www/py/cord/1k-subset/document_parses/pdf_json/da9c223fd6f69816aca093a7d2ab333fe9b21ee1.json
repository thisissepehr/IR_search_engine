Despite its relevance, serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection, when clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a weak anti-viral response and persistent infection, have not yet been identified. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a reproducible, accurate, and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum. This work describes the SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera of 60 PRRSV-positive and 60 PRRSV-negative, as measured by PCR, asymptomatic Large White piglets at weaning. Sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin (< 4.52 \u03bcg/mL) were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1-200 kDa were obtained with the CM10, IMAC30, and H50 surfaces.

The majority of peaks (42) were up-regulated in PRRSV-positive piglets, while 5 were down-regulated.

In fact, several peaks showed high similarities (MW differences \u22640.3 kDa) with previous works, in particular regarding viral proteins ( Table 3 ). The assignment of the discriminatory peak to a specific protein will require additional work, because the SELDI-TOF technology can only detect masses/peaks of proteins that are differentially expressed between samples but can not directly identify the proteins. This represents one of the major drawbacks of this technology compared to other methods. However, an advantage of the SELDI-TOF MS in this regard is that the results of this technique might lead to the identification of new proteins that were previously not correlated to the disease, and this might hopefully lead to the identification of new biomarkers representing the field situation. The interpretation of these results and the continuation of this project will benefit from the very imminent termination and publication of the sequence of the swine genome [38] , which will definitely contribute to a more precise annotation and a better identification of genes and proteins and thus will greatly facilitate genome wide mapping association studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 32, "end": 36, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 37, "end": 40, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1325, "end": 1329, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 490, "end": 497, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although a combination of peaks identified with different experimental conditions (e.g. using different fractions and different surfaces) might have provided higher discriminatory power, here we developed a PRRSV diagnostic test based on peaks identified with the same experimental conditions (e.g. fraction, surface, and focus mass), which can be reproduced at high-throughput at reasonable costs. These results provide a set of proteomic biomarkers and related, optimized experimental conditions for high-throughput profiling of pig populations by SELDI-TOF MS for whole genome association studies, where identification of proteins underlying the phenotype can be made a posteriori. SELDI-TOF MS might therefore represent a complementary test or a possible alternative to classical (PCR) and more recent diagnostic methods (e.g. antibody detection in saliva) for profiling large flocks of pigs at reasonable costs, using blood samples that are routinely collected for general veterinary inspections.
