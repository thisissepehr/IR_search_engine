At 2 d after infection, mice were passively transferred a single dose (4, 20, 100 or 500 \u00b5g) of mouse E16. As controls, mice were independently administered saline (PBS). The number of animals for each antibody dose ranged from 10 to 15. The difference in survival curves was statistically significant for all WNV-specific monoclonal antibody doses shown in the C1qa-and C4-deficient mice (P \u2264 0.001). The difference in survival curves for the Fcgr1-and Fcgr3-deficient mice was significant for 500 \u00b5g (P = 0.01), but not for 100 \u00b5g (P = 0.14) or 20 \u00b5g (P = 0.4) of mouse E16.", "latex":
