            "text": "Regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in vertebrates involves a negative feedback mechanism requiring the protein antizyme. Here we show that a similar mechanism exists in the \u00aession yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The expression of mammalian antizyme genes requires a speci\u00aec +1 translational frameshift. The ef\u00aeciency of the frameshift event re\u00afects cellular polyamine levels creating the autoregulatory feedback loop. As shown here, the yeast antizyme gene and several newly identi\u00aeed antizyme genes from different nematodes also require a ribosomal frameshift event for their expression. Twelve nucleotides around the frameshift site are identical between S.pombe and the mammalian counterparts. The core element for this frameshifting is likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of yeast, nematodes and mammals.",

            "text": "The ef\u00aeciency of +1 ribosomal frameshifting at a speci\u00aec codon is used as a sensor to regulate polyamine levels in mammalian cells. The frameshifting occurs in decoding the gene antizyme 1, which has two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Protein sequencing showed that the reading-frame shift occurs at the last codon of ORF1, causing a proportion of ribosomes to enter ORF2 to synthesize a transframe protein (Matsufuji et al., 1995) . ORF2 encodes the main functional domains (Matsufuji et al., 1990; Miyazaki et al., 1992) of antizyme but has no ribosome initiation site of its own. The antizyme 1 protein binds to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (Murakami et al., 1992a; Cof\u00aeno, 1993, 1994) , inhibits it (Heller et al., 1976) and targets it for degradation by the 26S proteosome without ubiquitylation (Murakami et al., 1992b (Murakami et al., , 1999 . ODC catalyzes the \u00aerst and usually ratelimiting step in the synthesis of polyamines, conversion of ornithine to putrescine. Putrescine is a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine and spermine. Because of its inhibition of ODC, antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the synthesis of polyamines. In addition, antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the polyamine transporter (Mitchell et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 1994; Sakata et al., 1997) . As discovered by Matsufuji and colleagues (Gesteland et al., 1992) and Rom and Kahana (1994) , increasing polyamine levels elevate frameshifting in decoding antizyme 1 mRNA and so increase the level of antizyme 1. Since antizyme 1 negatively regulates the synthesis and uptake of polyamines, the frameshifting is the sensor for an autoregulatory circuit. A second mammalian paralog of antizyme, antizyme 2, has very similar properties to antizyme 1, including the regulatory frameshifting, but does not stimulate degradation of ODC under certain conditions where antizyme 1 is active (Ivanov et al., 1998a; Zhu et al., 1999; Y.Murakami, S.Matsufuji, I.P.Ivanov, R.F.Gesteland and J.F.Atkins, in preparation) . Just like antizyme 1, antizyme 2 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in the body but is 16 times less abundant than mRNA of antizyme 1 (Ivanov et al., 1998a) . In addition to antizyme 1 and 2, mammals have a third paralog of the gene, antizyme 3 (also encoded by two ORFs), which is expressed only during spermatogenesis (Ivanov et al., 2000) . Zebra\u00aesh also have multiple antizyme genes, which differ in their expression patterns and activities (Saito et al., 2000) .",

The role of polyamines can be complex as illustrated by the transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to a lysine residue to form hypusine in mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-5A, the only known substrate for this reaction (Tome et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1999) . Spermine negatively regulates the growth of prostatic carcinoma cells at their primary site (Smith et al., 1995) , but at later stages of tumor progression it fails to induce antizyme, which correlates with cells becoming refractory to spermine (Koike et al., 1999) . Lack of antizyme function is also important in the early deregulation of cellular proliferation in oral tumors (Tsuji Conservation of polyamine regulation by translational frameshifting from yeast to mammals The EMBO Journal Vol. 19 No. 8 pp. 1907\u00b11917, 2000 \u00e3 European Molecular Biology Organization et al., 1998) and probably others. The levels of polyamines are altered in many tumors, and inhibitors of polyamine synthesis are being tested for antiproliferative and cell death effects. The synthesis of ODC varies during the cell cycle in normal cells (Linden et al., 1985; Fredlund et al., 1995) . It is induced by many growth stimuli and is constitutively elevated in transformed cells (Pegg, 1988; Auvinen et al., 1992) with some phosphorylated ODC being translocated to the surface membrane where it is important for mitotic cytoskeleton rearrangement events (Heiskala et al., 1999) .",

In addition to antizyme, frameshifting is also involved in the decoding of some bacterial and yeast genes and especially in many mammalian Retroviruses and Coronaviruses, plant viruses and bacterial insertion sequences (Atkins et al., 1999) . The site of frameshifting in both mammalian antizyme 1 and 2 mRNAs is UCC UGA, where quadruplet translocation occurs at UCCU (underlined) to shift reading to the +1 frame, immediately before the UGA stop codon of the initiating frame (Matsufuji et al., 1995; Ivanov et al., 1998a) . For the frameshifting to occur with an ef\u00aeciency of 20% or more, it is important that the 3\u00a2 base of the quadruplet is the \u00aerst base of a stop codon. Other important features are a pseudoknot just 3\u00a2 of the shift site and a speci\u00aec sequence 5\u00a2 of the shift site (Matsufuji et al., 1995; Ivanov et al., 1998a) . A pseudoknot 3\u00a2 of the shift site is a common stimulator for eukaryotic \u00b11 frameshifting, but the synthesis of antizyme is the only known case utilizing +1 frameshifting.",

The similarity is limited (~10% identity, 24% similarity to both human antizyme 1 and D.melanogaster antizyme); however, it is highest in regions that are most highly conserved among the previously identi\u00aeed antizymes ( Figure 1A ). Closer examination of the cDNA nucleotide sequence provided further evidence that it encodes an S.pombe homolog of antizyme. The initiating AUG codon for the ORF that is similar to higher eukaryotic antizymes (ORF2 of those genes) is not the 5\u00a2-most AUG in this cDNA. In fact, there are eight AUGs closer to the 5\u00a2 end. The \u00aerst or the second AUGs would initiate translation of an ORF (ORF1) that overlaps the longer downstream ORF (ORF2) such that a +1 translational frameshifting event in the overlap would generate a protein product analogous to the products of antizyme genes from higher eukaryotes. Furthermore, the last 12 nucleotides of ORF1 (UGG-UGC-UCC-UGA) are identical to the last 12 nucleotides of mammalian antizyme 1 ORF1s, including the frameshift site. Eleven of these 12 nucleotides are identical to the corresponding regions of all previously identi\u00aeed antizyme genes ( Figure 1B ). Previous experiments with the mammalian frameshift sequence tested in S.pombe have shown that this short 12 nucleotide sequence, by itself, is suf\u00aecient to stimulate measurable levels (up to 0.5%) of +1 frameshifting (Ivanov et al., 1998c) . To con\u00aerm the ORF con\u00aeguration of the putative S.pombe antizyme gene, a region corresponding to the two overlapping ORFs plus~80 nucleotides of the 5\u00a2 UTR and 370 nucleotides of the 3\u00a2 UTR, was ampli\u00aeed from both S.pombe genomic DNA and a cDNA library. The sequence of the ampli\u00aeed DNA con\u00aermed that there are indeed two overlapping ORFs with the deduced con\u00aeguration. This sequence (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF217277) differs from the previously sequenced cDNA clone by three nucleotides (two in the coding region and one in the 3\u00a2 UTR); one changes an alanine codon to proline, another is a silent mutation within a proline codon. Since the sequences from the cDNA library and genomic DNA are identical, we conclude that the differences with clone No. D89228 are most likely due to strain variation. This gene contains no introns within the ampli\u00aeed region.",

This distribution of polyamine content is very similar to that in other fungi for which polyamine concentrations have been measured (for references, see review by Tabor and Tabor, 1985) . The effect of SPA deletion on cellular polyamine contents was examined in both exponentially growing and stationary phase cells ( Figure 3 ). The cellular concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and cadaverine (but not spermine) were higher in the knockout strains than in wild-type cells. The greatest effect was seen on putrescine and cadaverine content, with smaller effects on spermidine, presumably because eukaryotic ODC activity directly catalyzes decarboxylation of both ornithine and lysine to produce putrescine and cadaverine, respectively (Pegg and McGill, 1979) , but subsequent regulatory events affect homeostasis of spermidine and spermine. The effect of inactivating antizyme on the polyamine contents in exponentially growing cells is modest (<2-fold in all cases). The effect becomes very pronounced in cells in stationary phase with up to 40-and 10-fold increases of putrescine and cadaverine contents, respectively, in the knockout strains.",

One had the wild- type SPA sequence while in the second, ORF1 and ORF2 are fused in-frame. SPA wild type and an SPA deletion strain were transformed with each of the overexpression constructs. Derepression of the nmt1 promoter is a gradual process since it requires dilution of the intracellular pool of thiamine (the repressor) through cell division. After 2.5 days of exponential growth under derepressed conditions, yeast strains transformed with either SPA overexpression construct show signi\u00aecant increases in doubling time ( Figure 4A ). The growth inhibition is greater with the construct expressing the in-frame version of SPA and after prolonged incubation (5\u00b17 days); these cells cease growth and accumulate in G 1 as determined b\u0233 ow cytometry (data not shown). The fact that the inframe overexpression construct, which differs by a single nucleotide from the wild-type construct, confers a more severe phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that translational frameshifting is required for expression of SPA. The growth phenotype associated with SPA overexpression is only partially relieved by adding 100 mM putrescine to the media (1 mM had no further effect) (data not shown). To see whether the slower growth is correlated with aberrant polyamine levels the polyamine contents of the deletion strain carrying in-frame SPA overexpression vector were measured under derepressed and repressed conditions, in both cases after 2 days of exponential growth ( Figure 4B ). As expected, overexpression of SPA results in signi\u00aecant reduction in the intracellular levels of all four polyamines.

Deleting 5\u00a2 sequences up to the third to last sense codon of ORF1 has little or no effect on frameshifting ef\u00aeciency. Deleting all but the last sense codon (UCC) of ORF1 leads to a 4-to 5-fold reduction in frameshifting ef\u00aeciency ( Figure 5A ). This implies that the conservation of the six nucleotides 5\u00a2 of the UCC-UGA frameshift site is due to their importance for stimulating +1 frameshifting. It also suggests that no additional ORF1 sequences of SPA stimulate the +1 recoding event. The 180 nucleotide 3\u00a2 region was searched for possible structure by computer RNA folding algorithms plus visual inspection. The algorithms predicted several minimal structures in that region. 3\u00a2 deletion constructs (constructs del.3,3\u00a2\u00b181,3\u00a2) tested the importance of any putative structure on the frameshifting ef\u00aeciency. The results ( Figure 5B and C) show that all of these deletions lead to a signi\u00aecant (~10-fold) reduction in +1 frameshifting, indicating the presence of a major 3\u00a2 stimulatory element in the 180 nucleotide region immediately following the frameshift site of SPA. However, the results indicate that none of the putative RNA structures in this region are suf\u00aecient for the activity of this element. Several additional 3\u00a2 deletions delineated the boundaries of this stimulatory element from the frameshift site to 150 and 180 nucleotides downstream (since construct del.150,3\u00a2 stimulates 5.5-fold more +1 frameshifting than del.129,3\u00a2, 150 nucleotides downstream probably contain most of the 3\u00a2 stimulator).",

The key question left is whether the recoding event is responsive to polyamine levels in cells. As shown above, overexpression of SPA leads to signi\u00aecant reduction of polyamine levels in S.pombe. An SPA + strain was co-transformed with an SPA wild-type overexpressing plasmid (cells overexpressing wild-type SPA grow slowly but continuously) and a construct that monitors the +1 frameshifting from an SPA frameshift sequence. The +1 frameshifting was compared with that in SPA non-overexpressing cells (in both cases frameshifting was measured relative to in-frame control). The results ( Figure 6 ) show a signi\u00aecant reduction (6.5-fold) in frameshifting ef\u00aeciency in SPA-overproducing cells that correlates with a decrease of polyamine content (4.5-fold for putrescine and 3.9-fold for spermidine).

Two constructs containing the entire antizyme cDNA, one with the wildtype sequence and one with a single nucleotide deletion that fuses ORF1 to ORF2 in-frame (in-frame control), were transcribed in vitro and the RNA was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The products were examined by SDS\u00b1PAGE (Figure 7) . The main product from both constructs has an apparent M r of 21 kDa, slightly greater than the predicted M r of 17.7 kDa [aberrant, slower than expected, mobility is observed with antizyme proteins from other species (Ivanov et al., 1998a) ]. From the ratio of wild-type to in-frame product, we estimate that the ef\u00aeciency of frameshifting of C.elegans antizyme in reticulocyte lysate is~0.8%, which is somewhat lower than SPA frameshifting in the same system. Addition of spermidine to the translation reactions almost doubles the ef\u00aeciency of frameshifting to~1.5% (the exact numbers are not easy to determine because of dif\u00aeculty in de\u00aening background values). The frameshifting properties of C.elegans antizyme mRNA were also tested in vivo in S.pombe cells.

Comparison of the b-galactosidase activity of cells (Dspa::LEU2 strain) transformed with the wild-type construct and the in-frame control constructs indicated 3.5% +1 frameshifting.

None of the invertebrate antizyme mRNAs identi\u00aeed so far, including those presented here, has a sequence in the equivalent region that can be simply folded to a comparable RNA structure. However, sequences immediately 3\u00a2 of the frameshift site are conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. The conservation of this region between Drosophila and the vertebrate counterparts has already been noted (Ivanov et al., 1998b) . The C.elegans antizyme gene contains the sequence YGYCCCYCA (Y = pyrimidine) in this region, which is identical to the consensus. The antizyme genes from the other four nematodes also have a similar sequence ( Figure 1B) . The signi\u00aecance of this similarity is not clear [in fact, sequences in this region appear to play no role in antizyme 1 in vitro frameshifting outside of the RNA pseudoknot context (Matsufuji et al., 1995) ].",

One is the RNA pseudoknot of mammalian antizyme 1 and the second is a short RNA sequence immediately following the frameshift site of Ty3 (Farabaugh et al., 1993) . Additional examples would be very helpful in deciphering the role such elements play in the mechanism of +1 frameshifting. It is currently not known how many and which of the invertebrate antizyme genes contain 3\u00a2 frameshift stimulators. The results presented here show that an S.pombe 3\u00a2 stimulator enhances frameshifting 10-fold. This stimulator appears completely different from the 3\u00a2 RNA pseudoknot in vertebrates. Our deletion experiments indicate that none of the predicted RNA structures contained within the minimally required 3\u00a2 region [up to 150\u00b1180 nucleotides downstream of the frameshift site ( Figure 5C )] are suf\u00aecient to confer the stimulatory effect. The SPA 3\u00a2 stimulator may act directly through sequence or may have an unusual RNA structure involving non-Watson\u00b1Crick base pairing. More detailed mutagenesis combined with phylogenetic analysis would be required to discern the nature of the 3\u00a2 stimulator of SPA.",

However, an alternative mechanism whereby the peptidyl tRNA merely occludes the \u00aerst base of the next codon, has been documented for yeast Ty3 frameshifting (Farabaugh et al., 1993) . Results of experiments with some mutants of the mammalian antizyme 1 shift site pointed to an occlusion mechanism (Matsufuji et al., 1995) . However, the mechanism with the wild-type, UCC-UGA, shift site is not clear. For C.elegans antizyme the UUU-UGA sequence would be an obvious candidate for a re-pairing since Phe-tRNA could pair perfectly with UUU in both frames. But with UCC-UGA the Ser-tRNA \u00aerst reading UCC could at best pair two out of three with CCU. This important problem warrants further investigation.",

The S.pombe cDNA library used as a template in the ampli\u00aecation was kindly provided by R.Rowley (University of Utah). The C.elegans antizyme gene was ampli\u00aeed using the following primers: 5\u00a2-CCCAGGAATTCCTCGAGTATTTTGA-GTATAATTTTAC (sense) and 5\u00a2-CGGCCGCTCGAGTTAGACCTT-GTAGCTCATGATG (antisense). This same ampli\u00aeed DNA was used to make the constructs for in vitro transcription and translation of C.elegans antizyme by cloning it into pTZ18U plasmid using the SacI and HindIII sites incorporated in the two primers. The in-frame construct was made using a two-step PCR. The cDNA sequences of O.volvulus and P.paci\u00aecus antizyme genes were obtained by performing 5\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 RACE PCR with cDNA libraries, which were kindly provided by Ralf Sommer (P.paci\u00aecus) and Susan Haynes (O.volvulus). The SPA overexpression constructs were made by amplifying the gene with the primers 5\u00a2-GCATCCGAATTCCCAAATCCAAGCATCATACGCC (sense) and 5\u00a2-GCATCCGGATCCGCCAGTGTTCTTACTTTGAGA-TGC (antisense), and then inserting BamHI-digested product between the MscI and BamHI sites of pREP3 plasmid. The in-frame construct was made by two-step PCR and subsequently all in-frame SPA constructs described below were made by one-step PCR using this plasmid's DNA as a template. To make the constructs for frameshift assays in S.pombe, DNA fragments with a given nucleotide length (as described in the main text), were ampli\u00aeed from both the SPA and C.elegans antizyme constructs described above. These fragments were then cloned between the KpnI and BstEII sites of PIU-LAC plasmid (Ivanov et al., 1998c) . The PCR primers included an`AC' spacer between the 5\u00a2 cloning site (BstEII) and the antizyme sequences in order to correct the reading frame. The in vivo frameshifting assays in S.pombe (strains ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h \u00b1 and Dspa::LEU2 ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h \u00b1 ) were done as described (Ivanov et al., 1998c) . The plasmid for GST\u00b1SPA expression was made by PCR amplifying SPA (all but the \u00aerst codon of ORF1 through the downstream ORF2) from an in-frame template and cloning the product into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pGEX-5X-3 plasmid. The antizyme frameshift site in the BMV-coatantizyme fusion construct (C3NE) (Matsufuji et al., 1995) was mutated with a two-step PCR. To generate the two knockout strains, Dspa::URA4 and Dspa::LEU2, both ORFs of SPA were replaced exactly with the ORF of either URA4 or LEU2. To accomplish this, two pairs of primers ampli\u00aeed URA4 and LEU2 such that 50\u00b160 nucleotides, which normall\u0233 ank the two ORFs of SPA,\u00afank the ORFs of the two genes. The ampli\u00aeed DNA products were gel puri\u00aeed and 2 mg of each were used to electroporate into ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h \u00b1 cells. URA + and LEU + transformants were selected by growth on URA \u00b1 and LEU \u00b1 media, respectively. PCR screen and partial sequencing, with primers\u00afanking the regions used for the homologous recombination, con\u00aermed the SPA disruptions. All DNA clones were sequenced with automated sequencing machines (ABI 100).",
