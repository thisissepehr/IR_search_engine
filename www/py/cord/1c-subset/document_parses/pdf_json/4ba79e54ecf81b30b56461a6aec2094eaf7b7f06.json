The most prevalent viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction so far were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A, Rhinovirus and Parainfluenza 3. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus first isolated from a dutch child with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) [3] . World wide distribution is probable since it has been isolated in North HMPV has been recognized as a member of the Paramyxoviridae like RSV and it is not only associated with bronchiolitis in most cases, but also with pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma [14, 15] , diseases which share some features with COPD. Up to date reports about hMPV in adults are scarce. In a general Canadian population 14.8% of patients of all age groups with acute respiratory tract infections were hMPV positive. Thirty-three percent of hMPV-infected patients were hospitalized and the hospitalization rates were significantly higher among patients below 5 years and those over 50 years of age [16] . In another prospective cohort of adults, hMPV was detected in 4.5% of all illnesses but also in 4.1% of asymptomatic subjects. HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly [17] . HMPV infection can be severe since the virus was isolated from the lungs from a previously healthy man who died from acute pneumonia [18] . The role of hMPV in acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) has been studied recently in outpatients and only low frequencies have been observed [17, 19] . Up to now the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized with AE-COPD is unknown. Our aim was therefore to investigate the frequency of detection of hMPV in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD and to compare these results to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without COPD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 166, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 167, "end": 169, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 481, "end": 484, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 751, "end": 755, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 756, "end": 759, "text": "15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1174, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1383, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1523, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1673, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1677, "text": "19]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Three different groups were studied.

Although this was not a controlled study and not all details of the study are available due to the fact that the data were published in form of a letter, these results support our findings. The incidence of hMPV in this and in our study is low compared to other respiratory viruses. In a similar previous study we found that Picornaviruses were detectable in 36% of AE-COPD patients, Influenza A in 25% and Respiratory syncytial virus in 22%[2].

HMPV was most prevalent in young adults with children and in frail elderly from long term care facilities [17] . Unfortunately this report does not specify how many of the elderly patients suffered from COPD. In our asymptomatic smokers without COPD hMPV could not be detected. A recent study investigating nasal secretions from adults with and without respiratory illnesses found hMPV in 5 of 146 ill patient and in none of 158 control subjects, strongly supporting our data [24] .
