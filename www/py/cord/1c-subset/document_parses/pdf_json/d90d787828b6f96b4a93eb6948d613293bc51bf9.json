Acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination. In the current study, we used a mouse model of chronic demyelination induced by continuous ingestion of 0.2% cuprizone for 12 weeks. This chronic process depleted the oligodendrocyte progenitor population and impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration. Remyelination remained limited after removal of cuprizone from the diet. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice. We used FGF2 j/j mice to determine whether removal of endogenous FGF2 promoted remyelination of chronically demyelinated areas. Wild-type and FGF2 j/j mice exhibited similar demyelination during chronic cuprizone treatment. Importantly, in contrast to wild-type mice, the FGF2 j/j mice spontaneously remyelinated completely during the recovery period after chronic demyelination. Increased remyelination in FGF2 j/j mice correlated with enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration. FGF2 genotype did not alter the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or proliferating cells after chronic demyelination. These findings indicate that attenuating FGF2 created a sufficiently permissive lesion environment for endogenous cells to effectively remyelinate viable axons even after chronic demyelination.",

Similarly, immature oligodendrocyte lineage cells persist in the adult human CNS and may proliferate to increase in number within and near MS lesions (8, 9) . However, these immature cells often fail to differentiate sufficiently to remyelinate throughout the extent of MS lesions. Therefore, the repair capacity of endogenous cells may be limited by nonpermissive signals in chronic MS lesions.",

Among these potential signaling molecules, we have examined the in vivo role of endogenous fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which is upregulated during postnatal development and in acute demyelination (10Y 12). During remyelination after acute demyelination, FGF2 null mice exhibit enhanced oligodendrocyte repopulation of demyelinated lesions (12) . This improved oligodendrocyte regeneration was further studied using in vivo retroviral lineage analysis in wild-type versus FGF2 null mice, which demonstrated that the predominant effect of FGF2 in vivo during remyelination is inhibition of OP differentiation (11) .",

Cuprizone reproducibly demyelinates the corpus callosum of mice (13) . Spontaneous remyelination is greatly reduced after chronic cuprizone demyelination in contrast to acute demyelination (14 Y 16) . Importantly, after chronic cuprizone demyelination, axons remain viable and can be remyelinated by transplanted OP cells (16) . In this chronic demyelination model, the current study demonstrates dramatically improved remyelination by endogenous cells in mice with genetic deletion of FGF2 as compared with wild-type mice. Thus, FGF2 expression in chronic lesions may limit remyelination and attenuation of FGF2 may generate a sufficiently permissive environment for spontaneous remyelination by endogenous cells.",

Analysis was restricted to the corpus callosum region from the midline and extending laterally to below the cingulum in 15-Km-thick coronal sections. Using the Stereologer System, the specimen thickness contributes to the sampled volume so that measurements reflect cells/mm 3 . The unbiased stereologic method could not be used appropriately for conditions with relatively few cells of interest in any chosen category. Therefore, quantification of cells in the corpus callosum expressing PDGF>R or Ki-67 required counting all labeled cells and using the Spot 2 CCD camera and software to measure the area sampled, resulting in density units of cells/mm 2 (12) .",

We used the cuprizone model to take advantage of the ability to stop active demyelination simply by returning the mice to a normal diet. As characterized in C57Bl/6 mice, continuous cuprizone ingestion results in persistent demyelination with a variable degree of partial remyelination, indicating a regenerative potential of endogenous cells even while mice are still fed cuprizone (24) . However, after 12 weeks of continuous 0.2% cuprizone ingestion in C57Bl/6 mice, spontaneous remyelination remained limited through the 6-week recovery period (Fig. 1 ). This poor remyelination after chronic demyelination contrasted with the almost complete remyelination seen within the same recovery period after acute demyelination (i.e. 6 weeks on cuprizone followed by 6 weeks off cuprizone; Fig. 1 ).",

After ending the chronic cuprizone treatment, this oligodendrocyte regeneration improved during the recovery period. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 1 , remyelination did not progress similarly during this 6-week recovery period.

Immunostaining for Ki-67 nuclear antigen was used to more broadly identify actively cycling cells within the corpus callosum (Fig. 3B) . Ki-67-labeled cycling cells were present at less than half the density of OP cells. This cycling population, although still relatively small, was significantly increased within the corpus callosum of mice fed cuprizone for 12 weeks as compared with age-matched controls or with mice that had recovered for 6 weeks after chronic demyelination.

Before cuprizone treatment, nonlesioned FGF2 +/+ and FGF2 j/j mice had a similar density of oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum at 26 weeks of age, which corresponded with the longest cuprizone treatment and recovery protocol. In addition, the cuprizone-induced loss of oligodendrocytes in FGF2 +/+ and FGF2 j/j mice was similar at the end of the chronic cuprizone treatment. In conjunction with the quantitative myelin immunostaining analysis, these findings indicate that FGF2 +/+ and FGF2 j/j mice experienced a similar chronic disease severity. Importantly, during the 6-week recovery period after chronic demyelination, the oligodendrocyte density returned to nonlesioned values in the FGF2 j/j mice, but not in FGF2 +/+ mice. Analysis of an additional intermediate recovery period in FGF2 j/j mice confirmed this increased oligodendrocyte regeneration and demonstrated that this repopulation could occur within 3 weeks after removal of cuprizone from the diet.",

A robust OP proliferative response occurred after 5 weeks of cuprizone in FGF2 null and wild-type mice that was similar to the previously mentioned data for C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 3) . However, the OP population was depleted during chronic demyelination in contrast to the amplified OP response to acute demyelination in C57Bl/6 ( Fig. 3) . Therefore, we examined the effect of FGF2 genotype on the density of OP cells and cycling cells in the corpus callosum after chronic demyelination. FGF2 genotype did not appear to alter the OP population dynamics of chronically demyelinated mice or age-matched nonlesioned mice (Fig. 7) . The density of OP cells, identified by in situ hybridization for PDGF>R mRNA, was similar in FGF2 +/+ mice and FGF2 j/j mice (Fig. 7A) . Somewhat unexpectedly, mice of both FGF2 null and wild-type genotypes, which are on a 129 Sv-Ev:Black Swiss genetic background, exhibited an increase in OP cell density after 12 weeks of cuprizone that was not observed in C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 3A ). This strain difference in OP accumulation after chronic demyelination corresponded with fewer oligodendrocytes observed during the recovery period in FGF2 +/+ mice (Fig. 6 ) as compared with C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 2) . Therefore, the FGF2 background appears to be even less favorable than the C57Bl/6 background for OP differentiation and oligodendrocyte regeneration, yet the detrimental effects of the chronic lesion environment can still be overcome in the FGF2 j/j mice.",

The density of cells immunolabeled for Ki-67 nuclear antigen increased in chronically lesioned corpus callosum with a return to nonlesioned levels during the recovery phase. The density of endogenous cells that were proliferating in the corpus callosum of FGF2 j/j mice was similar to the values for FGF2 +/+ mice (Fig. 7B ) and for C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 3) . The similarity of FGF2 j/j mice and FGF2 +/+ mice in our analysis of OP cells and cycling cells indicates that the dramatic differences observed in oligodendrocytes and remyelination may result from a permissive effect of FGF2 removal on OP differentiation into remyelinating oligodendrocytes.",

However, remyelination typically fails with recurring or chronic myelin damage. The current studies show the advantages of the cuprizone model of chronic demyelination for focusing on this compromised repair response. Importantly, our analysis in FGF2 j/j mice demonstrates that it is possible to overcome chronic lesion effects on endogenous oligodendrocyte lineage cells to increase remyelination. More specifically, taken together with our previous work (11, 12) , our findings in FGF2 j/j mice indicate that removing FGF2 inhibition of OP differentiation promotes spontaneous remyelination from a depleted pool of endogenous progenitors that persists after chronic demyelination.",

To take further advantage of this model for examining mechanisms to promote remyelination from endogenous cells, we have further characterized the endogenous oligodendrocyte lineage population responses during the recovery period. We used C57Bl/6 mice for this part of our study to facilitate comparison with other studies, because differences in mouse strain can influence the response to cuprizone as well as overall cellular responses to CNS injury (13, 27) . After a transient episode of demyelination from 6 weeks of cuprizone ingestion, spontaneous remyelination is effective throughout the corpus callosum. In contrast, after a prolonged period of demyelination, from 12 weeks of continuous cuprizone, the remyelination remains limited and does not progress during a recovery interval that was examined out to 6 weeks. This limited remyelination corresponds with depletion of the OP pool ( [16] current study). However, the number of oligodendrocytes increases somewhat during the recovery period without a corresponding increase in remyelination of the corpus callosum. Taken together, these findings indicate that the depleted OP pool has a limited capacity to generate oligodendrocytes, and available OP cells may fail to fully differentiate into remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the environment of a chronic lesion. In lesions of some MS cases, immature oligodendrocyte progenitors and premyelinating oligodendrocytes may be present in relatively normal densities without efficiently remyelinating (9, 28) . Therefore, further studies will be important for better understanding regulation of the OP pool size and the transition of OP cells into premyelinating and then myelinating oligodendrocytes.",

In PDGF>R heterozygous mice, amplification of the OP pool in response to acute cuprizone demyelination is compromised and the corresponding generation of oligodendrocytes is reduced (11) .

FGF2 is also predicted to stimulate neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) to contribute to repopulation of corpus callosum lesions (34) . During the prolonged demyelination period of the current study, the contribution of cells derived from the SVZ should have been evident in the dynamics of the OP pool in the corpus callosum. The lack of a detrimental effect of FGF2 absence on the OP pool may indicate that FGF2 effects on the SVZ cells may not be a significant contribution to the remyelination of the overlying corpus callosum. However, more direct analysis of the response of cells in the SVZ is required to make this determination. In addition, endogenous elevation of FGF2 in lesions may elicit specific effects that are not replicated with in vivo methods of elevating exogenous FGF2 levels (34Y37).",

            "text": "FGF2 is among the most effective neuroprotective growth factors in diverse models of CNS injury, including stroke, trauma, excitotoxicity, and axotomy (38, 39) . In contrast to this expected protective effect of FGF2 on neurons, removal of endogenous FGF2 actually improved regenerative parameters in lesions that involved remyelination. Improved regeneration of oligodendrocytes was observed in FGF2 j/j mice after acute cuprizone demyelination of the corpus callosum and after murine hepatitis virus strain A59 demyelination of spinal cord ( [11, 12] current study). In an example from the peripheral nervous system, FGF2 knockout mice were used to prevent the normal upregulation of FGF2 and FGF receptor (FGFR) activation associated with Schwann cells and macrophages at a site of sciatic nerve crush injury (40) . Compared with wild-type mice, the FGF2 knockout mice exhibited improved myelination and increased axon diameter during regeneration from sciatic nerve crush (40) . These results indicate that a detrimental effect of endogenous FGF2 on remyelination may outweigh FGF2 protection from acute axon damage in these lesion models. Indeed, the improved remyelination in nerves of the FGF2 knockout mice may provide significant protection of axons from damage subsequent to the initial crush injury. Correlative support for a similar role of FGF2 in a chronic autoimmune model of MS can be found in a study of neural stem cell transplantation improved into mice with experimental allergic encephalomye-litis (EAE) (41) . The transplanted mice exhibited improved remyelination, with a major contribution from endogenous cells, and had less axonal loss in lesion areas. Neural stem cell transplantation was also associated with a significant decrease in FGF2 expression and reduced astroglial scar formation in the EAE lesions. FGF2 levels may modulate scar formation in demyelinated lesions because expression of FGF2 and FGFR1 corresponds with scarring, but not nonscarring, astroglial responses after other forms of CNS injury (42) .",

Differential effects of FGF2 at different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage may occur through differential expression and activation of FGFR isoforms (43) . Oligodendrocyte lineage cell expression of high-affinity FGFRs and coreceptors varies with developmental stage and FGF2 exposure (44) . Furthermore, expression of multiple FGFR types is significantly increased in response to demyelination (19) . FGF2 may also have differential effects based on changing interactions with other signaling pathways that regulate oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation and myelination such as Notch1 (45, 46) and neuregulin (47, 48) . Interpreting a direct effect of FGF2 is complicated because neurons and glial cells express multiple FGFR types within and near demyelinated lesions (19) . Therefore, future studies will be required to identify the specific signaling components mediating endogenous FGF2 signaling in the in vivo context of demyelination and remyelination.",

Oligodendrocyte density is severely compromised in demyelinated lesions in some patients with MS. Further studies are imperative to optimize regenerative responses from immature oligodendrocyte lineage cell populations that have been observed in some MS lesions (9, 28) . Targeting inhibitory signals that are upregulated in lesions should be a viable strategy for therapeutics to promote differentiation as needed near lesions. FGF2 expression has been reported in reactive astrocytes of acute and chronic MS plaques (50) . In addition, in cultures from adult human brain white matter, FGF2 inhibited the differentiation of preoligodendrocytes into oligodendrocytes (51) . Strategies to promote remyelination by attenuating FGF2 inhibition of OP differentiation may take advantage of reagents to modulate FGF2 signaling, which are currently being developed for angiogenesis and cancer treatments. In our in vivo analysis, absence of FGF2 was not detrimental in the normal adult or throughout the disease process. Therefore, inhibition of FGF2 signaling may be acceptable across demyelinating disease stages, which would improve treatment feasibility in diseases such as MS that have an unstable disease course. Treatments to promote remyelination should be a valuable complement to strategies that abrogate ongoing causes of demyelination such as immunomodulatory therapies.",
