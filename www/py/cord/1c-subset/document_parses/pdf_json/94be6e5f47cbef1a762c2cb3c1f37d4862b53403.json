During this step, the follicle-enclosed postvitellogenic oocyte undergoes several key events such as the final acquisition of the ability to resume meiosis in response to the maturation-inducing steroid (MIS), the resumption of the meiotic process and, finally, its release from the surrounding follicular layers. In addition, the whole follicle (oocyte and surrounding follicular cells) undergoes a progressive differentiation ultimately leading to the release of a metaphase 2 oocyte. The key hormonal and molecular events involved in the control of meiosis resumption have been thoroughly studied and many studies have been dedicated to the action of gonadotropins, the regulation of steroidogenenic events and the action of the MIS (see [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] for review). However, the associated follicular or extra-follicular events involved in concomitant processes such as oocyte-follicular cells cross talk and ovulationmechanisms have received far less attention. Nevertheless, several researchgroups have studied the periovulatory ovarian physiology using classical biochemical or histological tools and, later, molecular approaches. Thus, several studies have dealt with ovarian proteases in their participation in the ovulatory process [7] [8] [9] . Differential display PCR and suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) approaches have also been developed in order to identify new differentially regulated genes in the fish periovulatory ovary [10] [11] [12] [13] . In addition, numerous candidate gene studies have also been performed in the fish periovulatory ovary. Apart from genes related to hormonal controls, these studies were mostly dedicated to some specific gene families such as TGF beta family [14, 15] or connexins [16, 17] . Finally, fewer studies have simultaneously analyzed the expression profiles of several genes belonging to different families [18, 19] . However, in contrast to other biological processes, such as immune response [20] , the post-vitellogenic period has never benefited from genome-wide transcriptomic studies that could provide a global view of the molecular events occurring in the post-vitellogenic ovary undergoing oocyte maturation. In this context, the present study aimed at performing a transcriptomic analysis of the postvitellogenic rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout ovary. In order to do so, 9152-gene rainbow trout cDNA microarrays were hybridized using RNA samples originating from rainbow trout ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. A statistical analysis was performed in order to identify all the genes exhibiting a differential expression over this period. In addition, a supervised clustering analysis was performed using only the differentially expressed genes in order to identify groups (or clusters) of genes exhibiting similar expression profiles. Furthermore, as a first step in a long-term transcriptomic analysis of the rainbow trout post-vitellogenic ovary, we deliberately chose to focus on 3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression patterns. Finally, specific genes were selected in each cluster based on the novelty of their putative identity and/or function.

The water temperature was kept constant at 12\u00b0C. Ovaries were sampled from individual females during late vitellogenesis (N = 6), post-vitellogenesis (N = 6) and during oocyte maturation (N = 6). Oocyte developmental stage was assessed under binocular microscope according to previously described criteria [21, 22] . Late vitellogenic samples were collected at the end of the vitellogenic process, approximately 3-4 weeks before expected ovulation. At this stage, germinal vesicle is not visible and no polarized cytoplasm area can be observed. Post-vitellogenic samples were collected 2-3 weeks later but before any noticeable morphological changes in yolk structure due to the process of meiosis resumption. At this stage, oocytes can display a subperipheral or peripheral germinal vesicle. When germinal vesicle is not visible, a dark mass of polarized cytoplasm can be observed. Oocyte maturation samples were collected after meiosis resumption. Those samples were thus collected after yolk clarification and around the time of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). For tissue collection, trout were deeply anesthetized in 2-phenoxyethanol, killed by a blow on the head and bled by gill arch section.

Briefly, 3 \u03bcg of total RNA were reverse transcribed using 200 units of Moloney murine Leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and 0.5 \u03bcg random hexamers (Promega) per \u03bcg of total RNA according to manufacturer's instruction.
