Upon characterizing the molecular events that are important for cytokeratin-17 induction, we demonstrated a link to an NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Above, we discussed the importance of this transcription factor in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression, and because of this involvement we were not surprised to discover its role in virus-induced cytokeratin-17 gene regulation. Perhaps the most interesting observation made during these experiments was the in situ localization of cytokeratin-17 protein to areas of cytopathic syncytia formation, suggesting a role for this cytoskeletal protein in their formation. Of note, we observed a dramatic decrease in RSV replication and in syncytia formation when we blocked cytokeratin-17 expression, suggesting that blocking syncytia formation, at least in part, impairs the direct cell-cell spread and productive replication of virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 180, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Differential display"}, {"text": "Although there are several companies that market these systems and components, the cytokine gene macroarray systems recently developed by R&D Systems (Sigma Genosys \u00ae ; Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Clontech (Atlas \u00ae ; Palo Alto, CA, USA) represent some of the newer opportunities available that have a focus on gene products that are known to be involved in inflammation. These arrays consist of different cDNAs printed as PCR products onto charged nylon membranes. An example of our experience with the Sigma Genosys array is shown in Fig. 3 .
