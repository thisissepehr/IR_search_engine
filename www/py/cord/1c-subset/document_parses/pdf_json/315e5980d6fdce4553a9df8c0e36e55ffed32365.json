In some states, newborn screening may include genetic tests for a wide range of targets, but the costs and complexities of the newer genetic tests inhibit expansion of newborn screening. We describe the development and technical evaluation of a multiplex platform that may foster increased newborn genetic screening. Methods: MultiCode \u00ae PLx involves three major steps: PCR, target-specific extension, and liquid chip decoding. Each step is performed in the same reaction vessel, and the test is completed in \u03f33 h. For site-specific labeling and room-temperature decoding, we use an additional base pair constructed from isoguanosine and isocytidine. We used the method to test for mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The developed test was performed manually and by automated liquid handling. Initially, 225 samples with a range of genotypes were tested retrospectively with the method. A prospective study used samples from >400 newborns. Results: In the retrospective study, 99.1% of samples were correctly genotyped with no incorrect calls made. In the perspective study, 95% of the samples were correctly genotyped for all targets, and there were no incorrect calls. Conclusions: The unique genetic multiplexing platform was successfully able to test for 31 targets within the CFTR gene and provides accurate genotype assignments in a clinical setting.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Few multiplexed technologies with sufficient specificity to identify small changes within the human genome are available for clinical use. Line probe or linear array technology uses nitrocellulose paper strips as the support matrix (1 ) . A benefit of the line probe is that expensive instrumentation is not required. A technology termed \"oligonucleotide ligation assay\" uses target-specific ligation to generate mutationspecific products that are analyzed by gel electrophoresis (2 ) . Other genetic analysis systems are coupled to microparticle flow cytometry (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Limitations of these methods include complicated procedures that require extensive training (washings, centrifugations, and transfers), long completion times, expensive instrumentation, and technician-dependent result analysis. In addition, these technologies are not easily amenable to automation. Many hospitals and clinics currently send molecular diagnostics tests to large reference laboratories. This is in part attributable to the limitations described.

MultiCode PLx uses one additional nucleobase pair constructed from the complementary nucleobases 2\u0408-deoxy-isoguanosine (diG) 5 and 5-Me-iso-cytosine (iC). These nucleobases specifically recognize each other based on a different pattern of hydrogen bondings. We chose this pair because no other such pair is available commercially and their chemistries have been well explored. For example, iG and iC have been successfully used for both molecular recognition (13) (14) (15) and for site-specific incorporation (16 -18 ) . In addition, because iG:iC recognition is \"orthogonal\" to the naturally occurring nucleobase pairs, a strand of DNA that contains several iC/iG components can be constructed so that it will not hybridize to natural DNA. In complex reactions in which high concentrations of natural DNAs of known or unknown sequence exist, this orthogonal attribute allows specific molecular recognition to take place without interference. These additional nucleobases are used in each step of the PLx process: PCR, extension labeling, and liquid decoding. PCR primers are first designed to be target-specific and contain single iCs. The amplicons act as labeling templates for the target-specific extension (TSE) step. During that step, labels attached to diG triphosphate (diGTP) are incorporated site specifically into coded target-specific extenders (Fig. 1 ). The tags are short sequences (typically 10 nucleotides in length) assembled by use of a mixture of natural and nonnatural bases. The tags are designed to hybridize only to their perfect complements encoded on color-addressed microspheres. In the final step, decoding of the extension reactions is accomplished at room temperature by capture of the coded extenders on the addressed microspheres and reading of the reporter signal on a Luminex 100 instrument.
