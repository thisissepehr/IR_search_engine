However, our study has some limitations. This was a single-center study that evaluated only HCT recipients; therefore, generalizability to nontransplant recipients and other institutions may be limited. Our study included low-risk HCT patients (ISI = 0-2) that may not require treatment with RBV; however, this group comprised a small portion (10%) of our cohort. Similarly, the number of patients in the high-risk group (ISI = 7-12) was low (15% of the cohort); thus, the impact of oral RBV in these high-risk patients needs further study.
