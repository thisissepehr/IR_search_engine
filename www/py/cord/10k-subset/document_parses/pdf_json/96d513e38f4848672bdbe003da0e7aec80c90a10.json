The results suggested that FRC had similar discrimination capacity with RSBI in our study population. RSBI is a widely used predictor for extubation outcomes and is designed to evaluate a patient's tolerance to spontaneous breathing 18, 19 . A high RSBI score indicates a rapid shallow breathing pattern, which is an early sign of decompensation. In contrast, the measure of FRC is used to assess the change of lung volume in a disease status 2 . FRC usually decreases in diseases leading hypoxemic respiratory failure and increases in obstructive airway diseases. In our study, we tested the association between FRC and extubation outcomes in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure were excluded because their change in FRC may be pathophysiologically different www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ from that in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Our findings suggested that reduced FRC was a risk factor for extubation failure. In the ICUs where bedside measurement of FRC is available, clinicians could consider using this modality to identify patients with increased risk for extubation failure, especially for patients with diseases that loss of lung volume is a key feature. However, this observational study did not test whether FRC can be used to guide the decision of extubation. Table 2 . Cut-offs of functional residual capacity divided by predictive body weight (FRC/pBW) in differentiating between extubation success and failure. In this study, we used the ratio of FRC/pBW to evaluate the change in FRC in the individual patient. We think this is a practical approach to assess the change in FRC at the bedside, especially when reference values of FRC are not available. The range of FRC in a healthy individual measured in a sitting or standing position is around 30-35 mL/kg 6, 7 . The FRC in our study (median, 25 mL/Kg, IQR, 20-32 mL/Kg) was below the normal reference values. The reduction of FRC observed in this study may be attributable to disease-and measurement-related factors. Diseases causing hypoxemic respiratory failure could result in a certain extent of loss of alveolar volume. Although the patients had been recovering from hypoxemic respiratory failure when the FRC was measured, the disease-related alveolar space loss may not be totally restored. The measured values of FRC are also affected by the settings of measurement. Previous studies have shown that FRC varies largely with sex, body height, age, posture, intubation, PEEP levels 8, 20, 21 . The European Respiratory Society provides an estimate of the FRC in healthy sitting individuals according to sex, height, and age 21 . In addition, FRC may decrease by 25% in healthy subjects in the supine position compared with the sitting position 8 . Intubated patients without pulmonary diseases could have 30-40% decreased FRC compared with predicted values 20 . The effect is probably related to a cranial shift of the diaphragm and loss of muscle tension among intubated patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 332, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 333, "end": 335, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1967, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1969, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2648, "end": 2650, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2651, "end": 2654, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2655, "end": 2657, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2792, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1463, "end": 1470, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We also evaluated the correlation between FRC and PaO 2 /FiO 2 and the tidal volume of spontaneous breathing (Fig. 4) .

To diminish the detrimental effects of FRC reduction, several modalities may be applied to reduce the risk of extubation failure. NIV provides inspiratory pressure support and PEEP, which may prevent further decruitment of injured lungs after extubation 24 .

The data support this speculation are that the patients included in the current study had average two sessions of SBTs before the planned extubation.
