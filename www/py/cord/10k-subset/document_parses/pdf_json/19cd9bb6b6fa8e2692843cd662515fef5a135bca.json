This review sets out the evidence for antimicrobial-associated harm and how this should be balanced with the need for prompt and appropriate therapy in infection. It describes the mechanisms by which antimicrobials may harm patients including: mitochondrial toxicity; immune cell toxicity; adverse drug reactions; selection of resistant organisms within a given patient; and disruption of the microbiome. Finally, the article indicates how the harms of antimicrobials may be mitigated and identifies areas for research and development in this field.",

For the clinician, their principal duty to the patient in need outweighs this wider and more nebulous benefit.

This led to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines emphasizing the importance of timely, empirical, broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy [9] . However, the effect of the timing of initiation of antimicrobials in patients already in ICU is less clear cut, a large observational multi-centre study possibly suggested that adequacy of antimicrobial coverage may be more critical than time of initiation [10] . In clinical practice, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines have sometimes resulted in the indiscriminate of empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobials in patients who have uncomplicated infections (an area where the evidence base is far less certain) and in those who have no bacterial infection at all [11] . There is some evidence that suggests that an early empiric approach may cause harm. A quasi-experimental, before and after cohort study [12] , performed on patients suspected of having an infection on a single Surgical ICU, compared early antimicrobial administration based solely on clinical grounds to a more conservative strategy, based on waiting for microbiological evidence of infection. There was a significant all-cause mortality benefit among patients treated with the more conservative approach (odds of death ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.0), despite a median 10-h prolongation in time to antimicrobial therapy, suggesting inappropriate antimicrobial therapy was associated with significant harm. This approach also appeared to translate into more appropriate antimicrobial choice and a shorter overall course duration.",

The potential harms of this were illustrated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of invasive versus non-invasive diagnostic strategies for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Patients in the invasive group had significantly reduced antimicrobial exposure which was associated with reduced risk-adjusted mortality [15] . Subsequent studies of diagnostic technique did not result in significant reduction in antimicrobial use or mortality [16, 17] , implying that it was the reduction in antimicrobials rather than the method of diagnosis that was the key factor. Similarly, in the largest RCT evaluating procalcitonin (PCT) guided cessation of antimicrobials, PCT-guided treatment was associated with lower overall antimicrobial use and mortality [4] . However, the association between shorter duration of antimicrobial use and mortality was not demonstrated by other, smaller, studies [18].",

It should be noted that, in general, these trials were powered for non-inferiority, which may explain why many of them failed to identify any significant reduction in antimicrobial-associated harm. De-escalation of antimicrobials, being the reduction in spectrum and duration of agents, has been assessed in a number of observational studies in intensive care and one RCT [26] , which did not show a survival advantage in de-escalation.

Beyond type I (anaphylactic) reactions, there are a range of other idiosyncratic immune responses that range from mild eosinophilic drug rash to the severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Within this spectrum there are also a variety of systemic and organ-specific reactions such as serum sickness, hypersensitivity vasculitis, angioedema, acute interstitial nephritis [53] . There is a growing recognition that some of these reactions are not simple immune system-drug interactions, but also involve interactions with viral pathogens.

A study looking at the development of piperacillin-resistant P. aeruginosa VAP showed an association with prior fluoroquinolone treatment [68] . This likely underscores the complex selection pressures driven by antimicrobial therapy on the host microbiome, and how antimicrobial-associated dysbiosis (see below) relates to the selection of MDR organisms. A study performed in two ICUs in the Netherlands, utilizing mathematical modelling, suggested that the predominant route of acquisition of MDR Enterobacterales was endogenous (i.e. from selection pressure applied to the patient's own gut microbiome), rather than by exogenous cross-contamination (i.e. from other patients, healthcare workers or the environment) [69] . This suggests that infection control/hand hygiene precautions, that have been very effective at reducing rates of MRSA infection [70] , may not be as effective in preventing MDR Gram negative infections and that antimicrobial therapy may well be a driver of MDR Gram-negative colonisation in the individual patient.",

However, there is considerable plausibility from animal models, where antimicrobial-induced dysbiosis worsens spinal cord injury [86] , increases the risk of pseudomonal lung infection by affecting mucosal IgA levels [87] , and impairs the immune response to Influenza A [88] . In terms of human disease, perhaps the clearest example of a disease arising from dysbiosis is Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD). Whilst the association between antimicrobial exposure and CDAD is long established, the realisation that this was not simply selection of a resistant organism has come more recently [89] . The role of dysbiosis in CDAD is underlined by the impressive response to faecal microbial transplant [90] and its ability to restore gut microbiota [91] .",

Antimicrobial stewardship programmes to reduce the use of antimicrobials in nonbacterial infections and non-infectious conditions reduce harm by reducing exposure [93] , whilst efforts to shorten courses avoid unnecessarily broad-spectrum or multiple agents may also be expected to reduce harm. In this area, the domain of healthcare improvement science, we believe that research efforts should focus on determining the optimal components of antimicrobial stewardship programmes and how to drive behaviour change [94] . Secondary infections are common amongst patients in intensive care [40] and efforts to reduce these through prevention programmes can have a significant impact on antimicrobial use [95] . Molecular diagnostic techniques allow more rapid and sensitive testing for infecting organisms [96] , whilst host-focussed diagnostics can identify patients with infection as opposed to colonization [94] . However, the impact of these tests on antimicrobial prescribing is not clearly established and should be a focus for future research. The heightened sensitivity of pathogen-focussed tests especially may inappropriately increase the use of antimicrobials. Limiting this inappropriate increase will require distinguishing between invasive infection and benign colonisation and may require the combination of both host and pathogenfocussed tests.",
