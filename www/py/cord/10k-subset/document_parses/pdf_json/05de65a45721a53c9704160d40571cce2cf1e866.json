We hypothesised that supplementing lipid membranes through nebulization of synthetic lamellar lipids would mitigate RILI. Following pre-treatment with either nebulised lamellar lipids or saline, anaesthetised sheep were prescribed fractionated radiotherapy (30 Gray (Gy) total dose in five 6 Gy fractions at 3-4 days intervals) to a defined unilateral lung volume. Gross pathology in radio-exposed lung 37 days after the first radiation treatment was consistent between treatment groups and consisted of deep red congestion evident on the pleural surface and firmness on palpation. Consistent histopathological features in radioexposed lung were subpleural, periarteriolar and peribronchial intra-alveolar oedema, alveolar fibrosis, interstitial pneumonia and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. The synthetic lamellar lipids abrogated radiation-induced alveolar fibrosis and reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) expression in radioexposed lung compared to saline treated sheep. Administration of synthetic lamellar lipids was also associated with an increased number of cells expressing dendritic cell-lysosomal associated membrane protein throughout the lung.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Radiation therapy is prescribed in over 50% of patients receiving cancer treatment. Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), namely pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, can follow radiation treatment to thoracic structures, chest wall, and lower neck, either because lung is part of the target volume or due to its proximity to the tumour target. Pneumonitis follows early after treatment and may be reversible however fibrosis is delayed and irreversible 1,2 . Rates of RILI can be as high as 70-80% in high dose regions of lung 3 . As there are no reliable predictive models to provide the likelihood or severity of RILI prior to radiation therapy, risk is reduced through dose constraints. Indeed, the risk of developing radiation pneumonitis shapes current recommendations in human planning to minimize the volume of lung receiving 20 Gy (V20) to less than 30% 4-7 . Other factors that contribute to pneumonitis such as age, concurrent chemotherapy and baseline CT findings are difficult to control, thus radiation dose constraints are important when weighing the risk of adverse events 8 . However, such dose limitation may compromise tumour control. New approaches to mitigate RILI are urgently needed to improve quality of life and long-term outcomes in cancer survivors 9-14 .

Organs at risk (OAR) were outlined to permit dose calculations and consisted of left lung, right lung, left mainstem bronchus, right mainstem bronchus, heart, oesophagus, trachea, spinal cord, reticulum, rumen, abomasum, and omasum. A clinical target volume (CTV) was manually created in the left caudal lung lobe starting at a level approximately 6 cm caudal to the level of the tracheal bifurcation, such that the medial border was 1 cm away from midline and the lateral border 0.5 cm away from the lateral thoracic body wall. A planning target volume (PTV) was created following 3 cm expansion of the CTV in all directions, confined within the left lung. At least 0.5 cm between the medial PTV edge and midline was required to ensure the mean dose scattered to the right lung was less than 1 Gy. The radiation prescription consisted of 5 fractions of 6 Gy to isocentre (central point defined in the target volume through which radiation beams pass) within the PTV to a total dose of 30 Gy with each fraction to be administered at 3-or 4-day intervals.

Following euthanasia by intravenous injection of barbiturate, the heart and lungs were removed from the carcase following standard necropsy protocols. The pulmonary circulation was perfused via the pulmonary artery with 2 litres of PBS before the heart was dissected away.

After fixation each lung was carefully sliced along the transverse plane, starting at the caudal pole of each diaphragmatic lobe, into fifteen 1 cm thick tissue slices. These slices were then arranged in order for photographing prior to a representative tissue block from each contiguous slice being selected and carefully dissected from surrounding lung tissue. A further photographic image of the slices with their selected blocks in situ was captured to document the spatial origin of each block. This latter step was a necessary prerequisite to registering the position of each block with respect to the radiation field through reference to the axial CT images previously collected from the same animals.

Unilateral single fraction high dose irradiation (30 Gy) of the sheep thorax produced radiation pneumonitis typical of the syndrome in humans at 4 weeks after irradiation 41 , and whole lung single fraction irradiation (15 Gy) of sheep resulted in the development of progressive dyspnoea three weeks after exposure; however animals were killed at 4 weeks precluding longer term assessment 38 . Some parallels and contrasts between these previous reports and our own experience are apparent. Guerry-force et al. 40 also described interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema, interstitial accumulation of mononuclear cells, and epithelial injury to type I and II pneumocytes, but they found no evidence of interstitial fibrosis up to four weeks after exposure 40 . Considering our results and existing data, our conclusion is that sheep replicate many aspects of the early human response to lung irradiation, and that substantial pathology develops in sheep subjected to a radiotherapy regime (30 Gy/5F/2 wk), which bears resemblance to hypofractionated regimens routinely applied to Quantification of ASMA staining.

Whilst peribronchial and peribronchiolar inflammatory cells, comprising mostly plasma cells and lymphocytes, were frequently identified in radio-exposed lung we found no evidence for radiation driving increased bronchial epithelial cytokine expression.

Alveolar mesenchymal fibroblasts are responsible for producing tropocollagen, the molecular component of collagen fibres, and the ground substance that fills the spaces between the cells and various fibres in the interstitial space. A particular population of differentiated fibroblasts comprise the myofibroblasts which are characterised by their expression of ASMA, as well as their ability to contract in a smooth muscle cell-like manner. Myofibroblasts play a fundamental role in alveologenesis 50 . In healthy lung sections ASMA expression is recognised at the tips of secondary septal crests, representing the cross-sectioned ridges running between the alveoli surrounding the alveolar ducts. The structure of the alveolar interstitial matrix is significantly compromised following radiation exposure. Central among the growth factors that co-ordinate matrix tissue re-modelling is TGF-\u03b2. This growth factor, which is ubiquitously expressed by all cells and tissues within the body, promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by stimulating different collagen, elastin, fibronectin and proteoglycan genes to produce ECM components. In addition to physical influences such as acidification or temperature changes TGF-\u03b2 can be activated by proteases, by reactive oxygen species, or by interacting with thrombospondin or the \u03b1v-containing integrins (\u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28). Activated TGF-\u03b2 can then interact with its receptors leading to phosphorylation of transcription factors Smad2 and/or Smad3 which in turn associate and form a complex with Smad4 before translocating to the nucleus to influence the transcription of target genes and the production of ECM components. In a rat model of radiation-induced lung injury, protein expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b26, TGF-\u03b21, T\u03b2RII, Smad3, and p-Smad2/3 was undetectable in the normal alveolar epithelium but increased in association with lung fibrosis six months after radiation exposure 51 .

This widely-held opinion has been recently challenged by evidence from a mouse model 54 in which ASMA-directed deletion of \u03b1v integrins did not prevent lung fibrosis in a bleomycin mouse model, suggesting that other subpopulations of fibroblasts that don't express ASMA (the majority) contribute to the integrin-mediated TGF\u03b2 activation and collagen production in this model. Other examples of increased ASMA expression in sheep lung include chronic lymphoid interstitial pneumonia in maedi-visna, a disease caused by the lentivirus maedi-visna virus (MVV) and characterised by lymphoid hyperplasia, hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells, alveolitis and fibrosis 29,55-58 , and mechanical ventilation-induced stretch injury in foetal sheep 59 .

The balance between these elements contributes to pressure-volume and geometric hysteresis during breathing 62 , and hence gas mixing and deposition in the pulmonary acinus.

Type II pneumocytes proliferate in response to injury and serve as progenitors for replacing lost or damaged type I pneumocytes lining the alveolar surface 63, 64 . More recently it has been shown that adult, differentiated type I cells can themselves self-renew and give rise to type II cells 65 . Whilst some limited concordance between DC-LAMP and Ki67 staining did exist in the hyperplastic foci this was not a consistent finding and indeed it was perhaps surprising that evidence of proliferation was so scant in these areas. Type II cells are well-recognised to be early susceptible targets of radiation effects and we found that their reduced presence in their normal niches at alveolar corners was associated with an increase in size of the remaining cells found in these sites; altered timing of samples may provide additional information as to the role and period of post-radiation injury and proliferation. Whether the hypertrophy reflects perturbed or compensatory increase in function is unknown. Further, the mechanistic association between localised clusters of hyperplasia and the diffuse loss of type II pneumocytes is not intuitive. Whilst hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes is frequently observed in pathologic states 66 , these cells have also been described as the \"defender of the alveolus\" 67 , with their dysfunction lying at the heart of interstitial lung disease. Indeed, selective injury mediated through delivery of diphtheria toxin to transgenic mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor on these cells induced diffuse interstitial collagen deposition with patchy areas of more confluent scarring and associated alveolar contraction 68 . The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but may reflect a homeostatic role for type II pneumocytes in the healthy lung. Recent evidence supports this notion as lung epithelial cells produce the anti-fibrotic mediator prostaglandin E2, which can mitigate the influence of TGF-beta 69 . Alternatively, type II pneumocytes can play an important role in mediating the pro-fibrotic influence of TGF-beta 70 . Li and colleagues (2011) demonstrated that loss of TGF-beta receptor signalling in these cells protected against bleomycin-induced fibrosis by inducing epithelial apoptosis, decreasing myofibroblast activation, and preventing a protease imbalance 70 . Senescence may also play a significant contribution to chronic lung injury following radiation. In a murine model of radiation-induced fibrosis, type II pneumocyte senescence occurred in a time and dose-dependent fashion following whole thorax irradiation, which was thought to reduce the stem cell compartment 71 . There is a complex set of pro-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and mitogenic cytokines that comprise the secretory profile of senescence (SASP), including TGF-\u03b21, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 that have implications on RILI 72, 73 . In a more recent murine study of radiation-induced lung fibrosis, rapamcyin effectively mitigated type II pneumocyte senescence, inflammatory cytokine expression, and collagen production 72 . Further study is warranted to determine whether the enlarged type II pneumocytes in the present study represent cells that have undergone radiation-induced early senescence.

Our strategy for selecting these anterior blocks was as follows: The block containing the cranial margin of the PTV was identified. Progressing cranially, its immediate neighbour was disregarded and the next block along selected as LL (or RL)_Ant. As this procedure was consistent it was assumed that any variation in the spatial relationship between the selected blocks and the cranial margin of the PTV would be randomly spread between the saline and LAMELLASOME TM groups. However, when we retrospectively examined these distances we discovered that there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the distance of the \"Ant\" section from the cranial margin of the PTV -the LAMELLASOME TM sections were approximately 7 mm closer (data not shown). Further, when the relationship between LL_Ant and RL_Ant DC-LAMP NND and Ki67 cell counts was expressed as absolute difference (LL-RL), and fold-change (1 + ((LL-RL)/RL) respectively, and compared to the distance of the section from the cranial edge of the PTV, significant correlations were found which would appear to explain the observation that pre-treatment with LAMELLASOME TM was associated with a decrease in DC-LAMP NND and an increase in Ki67 count in non-radio-exposed left lung (data not shown). This suggests a ramped decline in the biological effect of radiation (at least in terms of DC-LAMP cell clustering and cell proliferation) that extends beyond the margins of the PTV in this model.
