            "text": "Recently, some studies have revealed that non-Poissonian statistics of human behaviors stem from the hierarchical geographical network structure. On this view, we focus on epidemic spreading in the hierarchical geographical networks and study how two distinct contact patterns (i.e., homogeneous time delay (HOTD) and heterogeneous time delay (HETD) associated with geographical distance) influence the spreading speed and the variability of outbreaks. We find that, compared with HOTD and null model, correlations between time delay and network hierarchy in HETD remarkably slow down epidemic spreading and result in an upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon. Proportionately, the variability of outbreaks in HETD has the lower value, but several comparable peaks for a long time, which makes the long-term prediction of epidemic spreading hard. When a seed (i.e., the initial infected node) is from the high layers of networks, epidemic spreading is remarkably promoted. Interestingly, distinct trends of variabilities in two contact patterns emerge: high-layer seeds in HOTD result in the lower variabilities, the case of HETD is opposite. More importantly, the variabilities of high-layer seeds in HETD are much greater than that in HOTD, which implies the unpredictability of epidemic spreading in hierarchical geographical networks.

Most recent research results showed that both time and space activity characteristics, respectively, have significant impacts on spreading dynamics. However, it is still unclear to us how the spatiotemporal characteristics affect the prevalence. Indeed, the time characteristics of human activities is closely related to the space characteristics. Recently, some studies have revealed that non-Poissonian statistics of human behaviors stem from the hierarchical geographical network structure, in which we investigate how the scale-free characteristic of human contact activities influences epidemic spreading. We find that, compared with homogeneous contact pattern and null model, correlations between time delay and network hierarchy can remarkably slow down epidemic spreading and result in a upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon. More importantly, high-layer seeds arouse large variabilities, while low-layer seeds result in several comparable peaks of variabilities, which makes the prediction of epidemic spreading hard.

To understand the spatiotemporal patterns of epidemic spreading, the accurate mathematical models of epidemic spreading are used as the basic conceptual tools. There are various disease models like SIS (susceptibleinfected-susceptible) and SIR (susceptible-infected-refractory). 1,2 With the booming development of complex network theory, 3 epidemic spreading in complex networks has been strongly catching scientists' eyes.

On one hand, the non-Poissonian nature of human interactions results in slow spreading in the long time limit. [36] [37] [38] An analytical prediction was then proposed to understand the emergence of the extremely long prevalence time in spreading dynamics. 39 Further investigation revealed that this phenomenon mainly stems from weight-topology correlations and the bursty activity patterns of individuals. 40 By defining the dynamical strength of social ties, an interesting phenomenon was explained: although bursts hinder spreading at large scales, group conversations favor the local probability of propagation. 41 On the other hand, the human mobility patterns have a significant influence on epidemic spreading. 42 global outbreaks is determined by human travel behavior. 42 Considering two distinct individual mobility patterns (i.e., dynamical condensation and object traveling), both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations revealed that these patterns have an essential influence on epidemic spreading in scale-free networks. 43, 44 In the study of the fundamental spreading patterns of mobile virus outbreak, Wang et al. found that a bluetooth virus's spreading is constrained, which offers ample time for developing and deploying countermeasures. 45 Recent studies presented us that human mobility patterns are often dominated by specific locations and recurrent flows. 48 Balcan and Vespignani 46 and Brockmann et al. 47 thus studied contagion spreading in bi-directional movements and showed that its dynamics is significantly different from random diffusive dynamics.",

In this point of view, more attention needs to be paid to the effect of spatiotemporal characteristics. Recently, some studies have revealed that non-Poissonian statistics of human behaviors stem from the hierarchical geographical network structure, 49, 50 in which we investigate how the scale-free characteristic of human contact activities influences epidemic spreading.

However, in communication networks, such as Internet and telephone network, time delay of contact has no relation with the geometric distance. Thus, contact patterns of human activities can be divided into two categories. The first pattern is the heterogeneous time delay (HETD) of contact activities, which depends on the geometric distance. For example, cities far from disease origins are infected later than those near the origins. Thus, the time delay of a contact s ij is proportional to the geometric distance d ij between two neighbors. Obviously, the time delay distribution of contact follows power law, which is consistent with the distribution of time intervals between two successive messages arriving at a given receiver. 51 The second pattern is the homogeneous time delay (HOTD), in which the distance is ignored. For example, in communication networks, computer virus spreading is not restrained by the geometric distance. For this reason, we set the time delay s ij of a contact a constant. To compare effects of different contact patterns on epidemic spreading, we set the mean time delay of all contacts as a fixed value in simulations. It is noted that time delay s ij is generally not an integer such as 1.3. We separate its integral and decimal parts as 1:3 \u00bc 1 \u00fe 0:3, and then reset the time delay s ij \u00bc 1 with FIG. 1.

In simulations, the propagation processes are as follows: (i) Select a node as the initial infected (i.e., seed) and all other nodes are in S state.

We first pay attention to the case of random seed, that is, a node selected randomly as the initial seed. Obviously, in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), new cases in HETD has the lower peak value n HETD max % 0:006 < n HOTD max % 0:022, and the longer full prevalence time T HETD f % 600 > T HOTD f % 175, where the full prevalence time T f is defined as the amount of time that all nodes of the network are infected by a seed. Meanwhile, a upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon in HETD is very intriguing, which is consistent with the results in Refs. 24, 45, and 52. We suppose that this phenomenon might origin from the correlations between time delay and network hierarchy: time delays of contacts between the high-layer nodes are much greater due to longer distance from each other. To gain insight into the effect of these correlations, we employ null model where time delays are randomly exchanged between randomly chosen links (RNTD), and the time delay-network hierarchy correlations are thus destroyed. In Fig. 2(a) , n(t) in RNTD displays almost the same unimodal pattern to that in HOTD, except for a slightly lower spreading (i.e., n RNTD max % 0:020 < n HOTD max % 0:022). By comparison, we can conclude: although the heterogenous time delay of contact activities can result in slow spreading, 36,37,39 the very low spreading is dominated by the time delay-network hierarchy correlations. More importantly, it indicates that these correlations certainly lead to the upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon. In this network, the outbreaks in low-layer sub-regions occur much earlier than that in high-layer sub-regions because low-layer nodes are much closer to each other. Even if the high-layer nodes are infected, outbreaks will not occur in a wider range until their child nodes are infected after a long time. Therefore, the peak values at t % 7; 33; 78; 170; and 350 in Fig. 2(b) correspond to the outbreaks in the 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st layer sub-regions, respectively.",

As pointed out in Ref. 30 , the variability changes coincide essentially with the evolution of the diversity of infected nodes. That is to say, the more homogeneously infected nodes distribute among all layers, the higher variability is. For the case of HOTD/RNTD, the variability is maximal when the diversity of layers of infected nodes is the largest at t % 50=60. In addition, there is a small fluctuation of the variability at t % 7 because of the rapid spread in the bottomlayer sub-regions (i.e., a M complete graph). For the case of HETD, the diversity of infected nodes does not vary monotonically over time, because there is always a maximum value of the diversity when outbreaks occur in the different layer sub-regions. As outbreaks successively occur from the lowlayer to the high-layer sub-regions, the variability displays four comparable peaks. It means that the epidemic spreading in HETD has the variability over a long period of time, which brings a huge challenge to disease control.",

From Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), n(t) in three different contact patterns follow the same rule that the high-layer seeds can accelerate outbreaks. As mentioned in Sec. III A, the only access to outbreaks in the wider range is across the high-layer nodes.

For instance, there is single peak when a 1st layer node is set as the seed. On the one hand, owing to the characteristic of hierarchy, epidemic spreads from the high-layer nodes to the low-layer nodes, and thus the infected nodes gradually increase with time. On the other hand, the early prevalence is too slow due to time delay-network hierarchy correlations. After virus outbreaks in the bottom layer, new cases rate rapidly decreases because of the effect of network size. Therefore, the seed from the l \u00bc 1 layer results in only one peak. For the case of seeds from the l \u00bc 2 layer, epidemic spreading from the seed to bottom layer leads to the first outbreak in the seed-centered sub-region, and the first peak value is greater than the new cases rate value for l \u00bc 1 (i.e., n l\u00bc2 % 0:0021 > n l\u00bc1 % 0:0018) at t \u00bc 120. Owing to the farther distance of the seed to both its father node and the same-layer nodes, the second peak corresponds to the outbreak in the wider range, but the second peak value n l\u00bc2 max % 0:0056 < n l\u00bc1 max % 0:0068. Similarly, new cases surely have l peaks when the seed is in the lth layer. These results have intriguing implications in hierarchical geographical networks: although the high-layer seeds make outbreaks occur much fiercer (i.e., the higher peak), the low-layer seeds make outbreaks occur much earlier (i.e., the earlier peak).",

On the contrary, it is much easier to spread downward, which can arouse the more optional spreading pathways and the greater diversity. Thus, the outbreaks with the high-layer seeds have the higher variabilities. For example, 4 l\u00bc1 max % 1:35 > 4 l\u00bc2 max % 1:00 > 4 l\u00bc3 max % 0:70. Intriguingly, the maximum value of the variabilities in HOTD/RNTD 4 l\u00bc5 max % 0:71 is only half of 4 l\u00bc1 max % 1:35 in HETD. It indicates that the time delay-network hierarchy correlations make the predictability of epidemic spreading worse. On the other hand, although the outbreaks with the low-layer seeds have the better predictability, several comparable peaks of the variabilities, which corresponds to several outbreaks in the different ranges, cause a long-term trouble for pandemic prevention and control.",

First, we focus on the case of the random seed and find that correlations between time delay and network hierarchy in HETD make epidemic spread much slower than HOTD/RNTD and induce a upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon. Correspondingly, the variability in HETD is lower but several comparable peaks make the long-term prediction of epidemic spreading hard. Second, we investigate the effect of seeds from different layers on epidemic spreading. For three contact patterns, the high-layer seeds make outbreaks occur much fiercer, while the low-layer seeds in HETD make outbreaks occur much earlier due to the small distance between nodes in the low-layer sub-regions. Interestingly, three contact patterns display distinct trends of variabilities with the different layers of seeds. The high-layer seeds in HOTD/RNTD result in the lower variabilities, the case of HETD is opposite. It is notable that the variabilities of the high-layer seeds in HETD are much greater than that in HOTD/RNTD, which implies the unpredictability of epidemic spreading in hierarchical geographical networks. To make matters worse, the variabilities of the low-layer seeds have more comparable peaks, which means it is difficult to accurately forecast epidemic spreading for a long time. This work provides us further understanding and new perspective in the effect of spatiotemporal characteristics of human activities on epidemic spreading. FIG. 5 .
