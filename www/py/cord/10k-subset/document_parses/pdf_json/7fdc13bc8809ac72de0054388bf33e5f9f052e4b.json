This means that we aren't very faithful to the hypothesis that each individual is infected (and infectious) for k days. One way to model this more closely is to use a delay differential equation (DDE). We modify Model 1 by specifying that the recovery rate at time t is equal to the rate of new infections at time tk. This gives us Model 3: (3) One disadvantage of Model 3 is that we must specify initial conditions not just at t = 0, but also for -k \u2264 t \u2264 0; thus we need a lot more information. A second disadvantage is that functions I, S, and R probably will have discontinuous derivatives (for example, at t = 0 and t = k, when we switch between dependence on the initial conditions and dependence only on the integration history). This causes solvers to do extra work at these points of discontinuity. ",

Most ODE software provides a mechanism for stopping the integration when some quantity goes to zero; in ode23s, using the Events property in an option vector accomplishes this. Charles van Loan's book 1 provides a good introduction to the numerical solution of ODEs; more specialized texts cover the reasons for preferring a stiff solver like ode23s for certain types of ODEs. 2 For Problem 2, we can use ODE software, including ode23s, to solve certain differential algebraic equations (DAEs); in Matlab, using the Mass property in the option vector accomplishes this. Model 2 is a very simple DAE; Kathryn Brenan, Steven Campbell, and Linda Petzold's book provides more information on the theory and solution of such problems. 3 Delay differential equations (DDEs) such as those in Problem 3 arise in many applications, including circuit analysis. To learn more, consult a text such as Richard Bellman and Kenneth Cooke's book 4 or Jack Hale and Sjoerd Lunel's book. 5 In Matlab (Release 13), we can solve certain DDEs by using dde23.",

Computing (A 2 )e 1 costs s 3 + s 2 multiplications, which grows quite a bit larger when s is large. We should also take advantage of the zeros in A and avoid multiplying by them. If we do this for our matrix, then A has 21 nonzero elements whereas A 2 has 23, so again it takes more multiplications to form (A 2 )e 1 than to form A(Ae 1 ). We also should note that the product Ae 1 is just the first column of A, so we could compute it without multiplications. d. In this experiment, it took 280 Monte Carlo simulations to get two digits of accuracy. Asking for three digits raises the number of trials into the 10,000s because the variance is high relative to threshold.",
