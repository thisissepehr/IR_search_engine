            "text": "A taxonomic study by Naczi, Reznicek, and Ford (American Journal of Botany, 85, 434-447, 1998) has determined that three species (Carex willdenowii, C. basiantha, and C. superata) can be recognized within the C. willdenowii complex. To determine the amount of genetic divergence within and between these species, allozyme analyses were conducted on 14 populations distributed from Pennsylvania to eastern Texas. Seventeen loci were surveyed, 13 of which were polymorphic, with all populations being polymorphic at one or more loci. Interspecific genetic identities ranged from 0.560 (C. willdenowii and C. basiantha) to 0.807 (C. basiantha and C. superata). Alleles for the isozymes Aat-1, Dia-1, Idh-2, Mdh-2, Per-1, Pgm-1, and Pgm-2 served to distinguish C. willdenowii from C. basiantha and C. superata. Carex basiantha and C. superata were recognized by alleles of Mdh-2, Pgm-1, and Tpi-2. The genetic identities of populations within species were high and exceeded 0.957. A caespitose growth habit and perigynia in close proximity to the staminate flowers suggest adaptations for selfing and therefore low levels of heterozygosity. Paradoxically, the values for expected heterozygosities (H exp ) were always lower than those obtained by direct count (H obs ): F values were highly negative, indicating heterozygous excess. Disassortative mating and selection are discussed as possible mechanisms for maintaining heterozygous excess within populations.",

Population samples ranged in size from nine to 42 individuals. Because members of the C. willdenowii complex are caespitose, samples taken from discrete, well-spaced clumps were assumed to be different individuals. Field-collected samples were potted in a soil/sand mixture and placed in a greenhouse, under natural light in Winnipeg, Manitoba. All material was ground within 2 wk of potting. Enzyme extraction followed the procedure outlined by Ford, Ball, and Ritland (1991) with the substitution of Gottlieb's (1981a) for Mc-Clure's (1973) grinding buffer. Following extraction, wicks were organized onto petri plates and then stored at \u03ea80\u040aC until needed. Each plate contained a standard and a mixture of species and populations. Wicks organized in this manner simplified the scoring of bands on gels.",

The phylogeny and evolution of (Table  3 ) and gene diversity (Table 4 ) found in C. willdenowii and C. basiantha. Inflorescence height and geographic distribution may account for these observed genetic differences. Handel (1976a) has postulated that sedges with lower staminate spikes on a culm may have lower pollen flow than those species with well-elevated staminate spikes. Carex willdenowii and C. basiantha possess elongate culms and more elevated inflorescences in comparison to C. superata. Such a morphology may be more conducive to wide pollen flow and gene exchange. Carex superata, on the other hand, has extremely short culms with inflorescences that are crowded in the base of the plant.

Previous electrophoretic studies on Carex have focused on taxa largely restricted to open and/or early-successional habitats. These studies suggest that species can be placed into two groups based upon the level and apportionment of genetic variability. Group 1 is characterized by low levels of intrapopulation genetic variation but high levels of interpopulation and interspecific variation. F values are highly positive, suggesting high levels of selfing (e.g., Bruederle and Fairbrothers, 1986, Bruederle and Jensen, 1991; Waterway, 1990; Whitkus, 1992) . Group 2 possesses similar levels of interspecific variation, but this is apportioned within rather than between populations. F values are close to 0, suggesting higher levels of outcrossing (e.g., Ford, Ball, and Ritland, 1991; McClintock and Waterway, 1993 Nei's (1978) unbiased genetic identities and UPGMA cluster analysis. Cophenetic correlation coefficient \u03ed 0.991. casionally observed but are probably the result of sampling heterozygous clonal replicates (cf. Ford, Ball, and Ritland, 1991; McClintock and Waterway, 1993) . Ford, Ball, and Ritland (1991) postulated that these two patterns of genetic variability may be related to differences in life history strategies. Group 1 species are characterized by multiple hermaphroditic spikes or staminate spikes that are overtopped by the lateral pistillate spikes and a caespitose growth habit. Group 2 species are rhizomatous and have relatively few unisexual spikes that are widely separated from each other. In group 1 species the closest pollen donor could be a culm from the same plant, thus increasing the chances of selfing. The possession of multiple hermaphroditic spikes in some species could lead to an overlap in the maturation times of male and female flowers making it more difficult for plants to achieve dichogamy. Moreover, the stigmas may be in direct contact with the staminate flowers creating further opportunities for self-pollination. In group 2 species, culms can be widely spaced along an elongate rhizome, with many rhizomatous plants often found in close proximity to each other. Thus, the nearest neighbor may not be from the same individual, increasing the chances of outcrossing. The relatively few and widely spaced unisexual spikes found in this group could also facilitate dichogamy and increase genetic variability.",
