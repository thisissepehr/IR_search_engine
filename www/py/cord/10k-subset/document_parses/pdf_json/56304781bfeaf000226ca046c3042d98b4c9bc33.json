Case presentation: We describe our experience with a 37-year-old man diagnosed with severe viral pneumonia (influenza A). He presented with acute respiratory failure type I on admission. During intubation, his blood pressure and heart rate decreased, and epinephrine and norepinephrine were administered. Although his clinical condition improved 8 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, he experienced difficulty weaning. He remained conscious but had a poor spontaneous cough with sputum production and weak limb muscle strength. His cough reflex was absent during bronchoscopic sputum suction, and he used abdominal breathing during the T-tube test. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an Arnold-Chiari malformation type I, posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, and syringomyelia, with compression and deformation of the medulla and high cervical cord. The patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator at 20 days after ICU admission. Conclusions: Arnold-Chiari malformation type I and posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, which aggravate medullary compression and increase the risk of cervical nerve injury, might be a rare factor affecting prolonged weaning in critical illness.",

Prolonged weaning is associated with higher rates of complications and mortality [2] [3] [4] .

In contrast to most previously reported cases with type 2 respiratory failure, our patient initially presented with type I respiratory failure (pCO2, 24.6 mmHg) related to viral pneumonia, rather than Arnold-Chiari malformation. Our case was characterized by a weaning difficulty attributed to this Arnold-Chiari malformation and a posterior dislocation of the odontoid process. It is important to distinguish this type of weaning difficulty from phrenic nerve dysfunction or ICU-acquired myasthenia, as poor limb muscle strength or abdominal breathing are typical features of both conditions. In the present case, the main clinical manifestation supporting a diagnosis of compression of the respiratory center was the absence of a cough reflex during fiberoptic bronchoscopy suction. Moreover, this patient did not present with typical signs of medullary and high cervical cord compression before developing severe pneumonia. We note that this patient's symptoms of neck pain, upper limb numbness, and reduced pain sensation below the wrist could also have been caused by cervical spondylosis.

Medullary compression might have been aggravated by a long period of severe hypoxia, secondary brain edema, and elevated intracranial pressure, as well as by emergency endotracheal intubation while in the supine position. During intubation, the decreases in heart rate and blood pressure might have been caused by hypoxemia or compression of the medulla oblongata. The gradual removal of these possible factors led to relief of the medulla oblongata compression, recovery of the patient's cough reflex, and successful weaning from the ventilator. However, the significant changes in neurological symptoms and signs during follow-up relative to those observed before pneumonia suggested a cervical nerve injury. Kijsirichareanchai et al. have reported a 49-year-old man developed acute hypercapneic respiratory failure during an episode of communityacquired pneumonia [12] . Similar with our case, the man was diagnosed with Chiari malformation type I after the hospitalization without typical neurological symptoms and signs. Suffering from the possible additional medullary and/or cervical cord injury related to the intubation, the patient required tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation (more than 1 year).",
