The dU suppression test was carried out on bone marrow cells as described previously (7). The test is based on the suppression by cold deoxyundine (dU) of the incorporation of [\"HI-thymidine ([3H]TdR) into DNA in cell culture. A deficiency of folate or cobalamin or a disturbance in their metabolism leads to the impaired methylation of deoxyuridine to thymidylic acid. Such impairment results in the increased incorporation of ['HI-thymidine into DNA. Attempts at correcting the dU test were performed by addition of various folate and cobalamin derivatives (folic acid, 5methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF), 5-formylTHF, methylcobalamin (methylcbl), or 5-methylTHF and methylcbl). dU suppression was calculated as per cent residual ['HITdR incorporated into DNA in the presence of dU alone or with derivatives as compared to the incorporation in the absence of dU.

This case seems different from ours since fibroblasts grew at a rate sufficient to allow enzyme assays. Moreover treatment with cobalamin and folate resulted in rapid hematologic and clinical improvement. Homocystinuria would have been expected in our patient. The absence of homocystinuria could in part be explained by a remethylation of homocysteine by betaine homocysteine methyltransferase. Indeed, this enzyme, present in large amounts in the liver, could compensate for the deficient activity of methionine synthase. This situation has been reported in rats after exposure to nitrous oxide Methionine synthase defi, which inactivates methionine synthase (24). In addition homocysteine is also converted to cystathionine by cystathionine synthase. Recently, Finkelstein & Martin (25) have shown that in mammals, metabolism of homocysteine is distributed between these competing pathways. This case of methionine synthase deficiency was also found to be associated with abnormalities of immunologic functions. Throughout his life, L. B. suffered from severe and repeated infections. Immunological abnormalities were characterized by an hypergammaglobulinemia with 2 oligoclonal peaks, and by a fluctuating lymphopenia with a profound cellular immunodeficiency. It is not possible to determine whether this immunodeficiency was responsible for the occurrence of the severe measles interstitial pneumonitis or whether this viral infection induced secondary immunosuppression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ".

The cellular immune abnormalities associated with this case of methionine synthase deficiency are reminiscent of those observed in purine nucleoside phosphorylase or orotate phosphoribosyl transferase deficiencies (27, 28) . In these metabolic disorders, cellular immunodeficiencies are predominant and worsen progressively. They are often associated with the presence of autoantibodies and monoclonal immunoglobulins. In fact, methionine synthase is a crucial enzyme in preventing methyltetrahydrofolate trap and in regenerating tetrahydrofolate. This coenzyme is needed for DNA, RNA, protein synthesis and other cell functions. A functional folate deficiency can be expected to lead to an impairment of mitotic activity which is primarily manifest in rapidly proliferating cells, those in, for example, the hematopoietic, gastrointestinal and immunologic systems.
