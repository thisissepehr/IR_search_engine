The genes coding for these proteins are located on different chromosomes. SP-B and SP-C are similarly structured hydrophobic proteins participating in the adsorption of phospholipids at the alveolar border, which leads to rapid reduction of the surface tension. The hydrophilic proteins SP-A and SP-D are members of the collectins with C-type lectin domains. SP-D together with SP-A play a role in the pulmonary defense against Gramnegative bacteria [4] .",

Moreover expression of SP-A was also described for a portion of NSCLC facilitating a diagnostic marker for these carcinomas [5, 6] . After characterization of the biochemical properties, a complex chromosomal organization of the genes coding for SP-A has been demonstrated [3] . The locus of the SP-A on the one hand consists of two functionally active genes and a pseudogene [7, 8] . The two active genes SP-A1 and SP-A2 on the other hand display several different alleles and splicing variants, moreover different oligomeric states have been described [3, 9] . During the development of the lung these two genes are regulated differentially, a process triggered by cAMP and glucocorticoids [10] . The SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes display a homology of 94% in their nucleotide sequences and even 96% homology in the amino acid sequences [11] . Fig. 1 , as one example, shows the transcriptional activity of the SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes determined by RT-PCR in homogenates of biopsies from NSCLC and corresponding tumor-free samples. The importance of the differential transcription of SP-A1 and SP-A2 for maintaining pulmonary function has repeatedly been demonstrated [12] . Phylogenetic analyses revealed that an ancestor proto-SP-A gene was diverged into SP-A1 and a second gene which subsequently emerged to SP-A2 and the SP-A pseudogene [3] . The high level of homology between SP-A1 and SP-A2 up to date prevents a differential analysis of the two gene products in situ. The expression of SP-A is also complexly regulated on the transcriptional level. Moreover the protein-turnover and the release of SP-A into the serum represents a further point of regulation [12] . This sophisticated regulation of the genetic activity is recognized as a further hint for the functional importance of SP-A.",

In the case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for example, low levels of SP-A (measured by ELISA) have been reported in broncho alveolar lavages (BAL), but elevated levels were found in the sera [32] [33] [34] . Immunohistochemical examinations of the expression of SP-A in pulmonary fibrosis demonstrated evident defects by using specimens from different diseases displaying fibrotic changes in the lungs. In good agreement with the results in BAL reduced levels of SP-A have been observed in fibrotic lungs. This reduced SP-A-expression in fibrotic lungs may be caused by two reasons: a limited number of the SP-A producing type II pneumocytes and by a clearly reduced SP-A expression of the remaining cells [35] .",

It has been reported that SP-A levels in BAL or serum from patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis correlate with the progression of the disease and can be used to predict survival [34, 38] . In samples from airway secretions SP-A measurements are described to be useful also for the diagnostics of pulmonary edema where elevated levels have been found compared to healthy volunteers and ARDS patients [39]. By utilizing highly sensitive RT-PCR techniques the amplification of SP-A transcripts can be used for the detection of occult metastases in non small cell lung cancer patients [5, 40] . Comparative studies of different malignomas with pulmonary localization have shown the diagnostic properties of immunohistochemically determined SP-A [6, 41, 42] . In carcinomas of occult origin localized in the lungs the diagnosis has a crucial influence on the therapy. A positive detection of SP-A represents a clear hint for a primary location in the lung [43]. Fig. 2 as an example shows the immunohistochemical detection of SP-A in a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung using the primary monoclonal antibody PE-10 and LSAB (AEC-substrate, \u00d7 100). The positive staining in the tumor cells (reddish) in this certain case helped to manifest the diagnosis as a primary carcinoma of the lung.",
