We analyzed patient characteristics and IMHA management by reoperations after mitral valve surgery. Methods: We collected medical records from mitral valve patients requiring reoperation due to IMHA. Inclusion criteria: hemoglobin < 100 g/L; positive hemolysis tests and echocardiography results; and exclusion of other hemolysis causes. Results: Data from 25 IMHA cases included 10 (40%) early onset (1.3 (0.3,3.0) months) and 15 (60%) late onset (120 (24,204) months) cases. Early IMHA etiologies included surgical defects (6, 60%), uncontrolled infection (3, 30%) and Bechet's disease (1, 10%). Late IMHA etiologies included degeneration (13, 87%), new infection (1, 7%) and trauma (1, 7%). There were more mechanical valves (15, 88%) than bio-valves (2, 12%); the main valvular dysfunction was paravalvular leak (16, 64%). IMHA manifestations included jaundice (18, 72%), dark urine (21, 84%), heart failure (16, 64%), acute kidney injury (11, 44%), hepatomegaly (15, 60%), splenomegaly (15, 60%) and pancreatitis (1, 4%). Laboratory results showed decreased hemoglobin (70 \u00b1 14 g/L) and increased bilirubin (72 \u00b1 57 \u03bcmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (2607 \u00b1 2142 IU/L) and creatinine (136 \u00b1 101 \u03bcmol/L) levels. Creatinine level negatively correlated with hemoglobin level (B = -3.33, S.E. B = 1.31, Exp(B) = 368.15, P = 0.018). Preoperative medications included iron supplements (20, 80%), erythropoietin (16, 64%) and beta-blocker (22, 88%). Two patients died of cardiac causes before reoperation. The other 23 underwent reoperation with long surgical times (aortic cross clamp 124 \u00b1 50 min, cardiopulmonary bypass 182 \u00b1 69 min) and blood transfusions (red blood cells 6 (6, 8) units, plasma 600 (400,800) ml, platelet 1(0,2) units). Postoperative complications included cardiac dysfunction (5, 22%), arrhythmia (10, 43%), sepsis (6, 26%), pulmonary infection (5, 22%), gastrointestinal bleeding (3, 13%), cerebral hemorrhage (2, 9%), chronic renal dysfunction (1, 4%) and surgical hemorrhage (1, 4%). Five (33%) patients died after reoperation from cardiac dysfunction (3, 60%), septic shock (1, 20%) and self-discharge (1, 20%).
