Teaming up with a group that almost certainly does not share the biotechnology company's vision, because they (frankly) do not understand your business, can doom the company. Venture capitalist (VC) funds are not interested in advancing a product to market per se. Their stated objective is to secure for their investors the highest possible return on investment. The way most VCs try to accomplish this today is by seeking to reduce the pre-money valuation of the company to compensate for the fact that eight or nine out of ten of their investments lose money and they strive to make their entire return on the one or two that do make money. VCs thus should, but usually do not, recognise that they have little or no ability to identify which product or technology will be the next blockbuster or stepping-stone technology. Therefore, the prospect of entering into an agreement with a biotech or pharma partner, which is probably more capable of valuing a product or technology, is on its face very attractive and appears to be the focus of most biotech companies to advance their products to market.",

The aim was to develop a better vaccine for the elderly population, where the licensed vaccine is less effective than in other populations. A clinical study was conducted in 399 elderly subjects (average age 70 years) in 2003-2004 in collaboration with NIAID, which indeed demonstrated the FluBl\u00d8k has the potential to outperform the licensed vaccine and potentially save more than 30,000 lives per year in the US alone! Following these results, sufficient funding was secured to sponsor a field efficacy study. Results of this efficacy study were excellent. The 135 \u00ecg dose of FluB1\u00d8k was 100 per cent efficacious in preventing culture positive influenza illness, the FDA standard measure of efficacy, compared to placebo (statistically significant: p=0.0146) and also met the established measure of vaccine effectiveness in that it statistically significantly reduced the occurrence of flu-like symptoms (as defined by CDC) compared to placebo (p\u00bc< 0:05). The race is now on once again to either identify a bona-fide licensee or secure money through the capital markets. The GeneXpress business continues to grow and this business is anticipated to further expand once the first BEVSproduced products reach the market. There has been a relatively slow acceptance of the technology because most companies prefer not to pioneer a new technology that has not yet produced a licensed product. Also, manufacturing capacity for this technology has not developed as rapidly as expected and therefore we are planning to establish our own product launch-capable facility.",
