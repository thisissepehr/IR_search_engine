Electron micrograph featuring portion of a pericyte containing cytoplasmic tubular complexes (arrow) (uranyl acetate and lead citrate stain, original magnification X 15.000). Vol. 53 FIG. 10. Case 3. Photomicrograph of an area from KS stained by immunoperoxidase technique for Factor VIIl Ag. Small vascular spaces with positive d o n within the cytoplasm of endothelial cells can be seen. Stromal cells are mostly negative (original magnification X85). entiation is rather poor, so that no exact categorization can be made. The histogenesis of KS is still controversial. Several hypotheses have been advanced with regard to the cell of origin. Pepler and Theron suggested an origin from Schwann cells on the basis of the presence of intracytoplasmic lamellated bodies which they interpreted as resembling the myelin m heath.^ These findings, however, have not been confirmed in subsequent studies. Niemi and Maskatellio suggested that the tumor is derived from pericytes, whereas Hashimoto and Lever concluded that the tumor is composed of two kinds of cells, namely endothelial and perithelial Harrison and Kahn proposed an origin from primitive mesenchymal cells which have the potential to differentiate into several specialized connective tissue cell types.' We believe that KS is derived from primitive vasoformative mesenchyme. The demonstration of myofibroblasts in our cases of KS, as well as in one previous report by Hamson and Kahn, is of interest.* Myofibroblasts may be seen in a variety of soft tissue tumors, such as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma and fibromato~is.~*l~ This cell is also known to form a major component of the spindle cells in granulation tissue. I 'J' In granulation tissue there is proliferation of endothelial-lined spaces which are separated from one another by spindle-shaped cells. This structural arrangement is identical to that seen in KS. Ultrastructural studies of granulation tissue have revealed that the vascular spaces are lined by endothelial cells which are surrounded externally by welldeveloped basal lamina; these in turn may be surrounded by a layer of pericytes. The cells present within the intercapillary spaces have the ultrastructural features of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.
