Building on earlier work [18] , we develop a simple model of influenza immunity and transmission dynamics in the USA (see electronic supplementary information for technical details). The model incorporates two types of immunity, as follows. (i) HAspecific immunity, which reduces susceptibility to infection and is acquired either through past infection or through effective strainmatched vaccination. This immunity is strain-specific and does not protect against novel pandemic viruses. (ii) Cross-protective immunity, which is assumed to be independent of HA-specific immunity and is likewise acquired either through past infection or through a UIV. This immunity is heterosubtypic: that is, it offers protection across different subtypes. Moreover, we assume that cross-protective immunity does not affect susceptibility to infection, but rather limits viral load during the course of infection, thus reducing infectiousness. This would be consistent, for example, with a UIV targeting T-cell antigens [19] ; however, we note that HA-stem antibodies would be expected to offer some protection against infection [20, 21] (table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1141, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1250, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1254, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1255, "end": 1264, "text": "(table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Material and methods"}, {"text": "We simulate a population that is subject to seasonal UIV vaccination, and subsequently exposed to a 2012/13-like season (a severe season in the USA).

Figure 1 shows one illustrative scenario, where the test population is exposed to a pandemic virus (to begin, we assume there is no supplementary UIV programme mounted in direct response to the pandemic). At low levels of UIV coverage, a seasonal UIV programme may in fact increase the pandemic size. Figure 1b illustrates reasons for this behaviour. By bringing down seasonal incidence, the UIV programme reduces opportunities for individuals to acquire infection-induced immunity. As a result, there is an expanded pool of individuals who have been neither vaccinated nor infected, and who are thus vulnerable to the emergence of a pandemic virus. However, the figure also illustrates that it is possible to overcome this population effect if a seasonal UIV programme has sufficient coverage. In particular, a UIV with 80% efficacy and 75% coverage would not only interrupt transmission for the 2012/13-like season, but would also result in a mitigated pandemic, relative to the absence of vaccination.

The development of universal influenza vaccines is still in its early stages; in the absence of largescale trials, mathematical modelling can be a helpful tool for generating some preliminary insights into the potential population implications of these vaccines. Here we have illustrated two potential risks. First, a UIV could in principle control seasonal epidemics, without fully compensating (at the population level) for the reduced opportunities for individuals to gain infectioninduced immunity (figure 1b). Doing so would leave the population more vulnerable to a pandemic. Indeed, a similar effect has been proposed among those receiving conventional vaccines [22] .

Likewise in the case of compromising strain-specific immunity, an approach that deploys conventional, strain-matched vaccines in parallel with UIVs, together with multiple UIV targets, could mitigate strongly against the risk of vaccine escape.

Here and throughout, we define the 'efficacy' of a UIV as the percentage drop in transmission potential arising from vaccination. (a) Pandemic size under a range of values for seasonal UIV coverage and efficacy (assuming no vaccination response against the pandemic). The rising edge marked (i) illustrates that low seasonal UIV coverage, especially for an efficacious vaccine, can inadvertently increase pandemic attack rates. (b) How cross-protective immunity in the test population is affected by seasonal UIV coverage, at 80% UIV efficacy (i.e. the edge marked (i) in (a)). Vaccination brings down the amount of infection-acquired immunity in the test population (blue curve). At low coverage, the vaccination programme fails to compensate for this loss of immunity (yellow curve, initial decline). The dashed grey line indicates the level of cross-protective immunity in the absence of the UIV programme; this is only exceeded by a UIV coverage of at least 75%.
