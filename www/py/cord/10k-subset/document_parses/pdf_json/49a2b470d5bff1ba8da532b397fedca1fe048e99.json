Accordingly, cognitive-behavioral models that emphasize dysfunctional beliefs about bodily symptoms and illness have been proposed to account for the development of HC (Abramowitz, Schwartz, & Whiteside, 2002; Warwick & Salkovskis, 1990) . Examples of such beliefs include the assumption that symptoms always indicate that something is seriously wrong (i.e., hurt equals harm), and exaggerated notions of the likelihood and severity of acquiring a serious illness. These beliefs increase the risk of developing catastrophic cognitions when individuals are exposed to ambiguous (benign) bodily symptoms or health-related information. For example, someone who believes they are at high risk of developing a brain tumor might become anxious if he or she notices even a slight feeling of dizziness (''this symptom means I have a tumor''). Once concerned about the possibility of illness, the person becomes hypervigilant for any signs of infirmity and is motivated to reduce their worry by acquiring complete certainty regarding their health status.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 393, "text": "(Abramowitz, Schwartz, & Whiteside, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 394, "end": 421, "text": "Warwick & Salkovskis, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Given that HC is associated with mistaken beliefs about illnesses, it is important to understand why such beliefs persist despite contradictory information (i.e., the illness never materializes) and repeated reassurance of good health from medical professionals. According to the cognitive-behavioral model, mistaken beliefs are maintained by the very strategies individuals use to cope with their health-related anxiety, such as attempts to prevent the feared illness, avoidance, and attempts to attain certainty about health status. Not only are these safety-seeking behaviors unnecessary, they also prohibit individuals from acquiring information that would disconfirm their beliefs. For example, one man was preoccupied with the (illogical) fear that his pupils did not constrict properly, and that he was incurring gradual (yet permanent) retinal damage from overexposure to light. His main safety-behavior involved always wearing sunglasses. When questioned about the fact that his sight was still normal, he replied that this was because of his constant use of sunglasses. Thus, the safety behavior had prevented him from seeing that his eyes actually functioned normally and that he was not in danger of losing his sight. Figure 1 graphically depicts the cognitive-behavioral model of HC outlined above. Although HC is considered a somatoform disorder in DSM-IV, it should be noted that the formulation described above is similar to cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations proposed to account for the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders such panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (e.g., Clark, 1986; Salkovskis, 1985) . In particular, HC and the anxiety disorders all involve (a) the misinterpretation of benign and normally occurring experiences (e.g., arousal-related sensations, intrusive thoughts about harm) leading to anxiety and (b) the use of safety-seeking behavior which paradoxically maintains the anxiety. Accordingly, HC is best conceptualized as an extreme form of health anxiety.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1619, "end": 1631, "text": "Clark, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1649, "text": "Salkovskis, 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1230, "end": 1238, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although treatment based on the cognitive-behavioral formulation of HC has demonstrated efficacy in initial studies (Barsky & Ahern, 2004; Warwick, Clark, Cobb, & Salkovskis, 1996) , research on the psychopathology of health anxiety and HC from this perspective is in its early stages.

The measure is brief and does not include items assessing non-specific or extraneous phenomena as are present in the IAS, the most commonly used measure of HC.

In contrast, SHAI items provide an assessment of health anxiety-related cognitions independent of the respondent's health status, specific feared illnesses, and HC-related behaviors (e.g., doctor visits, body checking). Accordingly, Salkovskis et al. (2002) found that the SHAI differentiated individuals with HC from medically ill patients without HC and those with other anxiety problems.

Cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations of HC highlight the anxiogenic role played by overestimations of the likelihood and severity of acquiring a serious illness (Warwick & Salkovskis, 1990) . Because the SHAI Illness Likelihood and Illness Severity factors assess these respective cognitive biases, we were able to examine the links between these cognitions and HC-related variables. In the present study, the Illness Likelihood factor more strongly predicted medical utilization and safety-seeking behaviors than the Illness Severity factor. In contrast, intolerance of uncertainty was more strongly associated with illness severity (r = .45) than with illness likelihood (r = .32). These findings suggest that HC-related safety behaviors may be motivated, in part, by attempts to reduce concerns about the likelihood of having an illness. On the other hand, concerns about the negative consequences of having an illness, regardless of the probability of its acquisition, may be more strongly associated with intolerance of uncertainty. That is, intolerance of uncertainty may underlie extreme anxiety about diseases that are readily acknowledged as improbable (e.g., SARS, West Nile virus).

In particular, body vigilance is thought to increase the likelihood of perceiving bodily symptoms that may be interpreted in a catastrophic fashion, thus strengthening the perception (and fear) of having an illness and attempts to seek reassurance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 132, "text": "(Schmidt, Lerew, & Trakowski, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous studies using panic patients and non-clinical volunteers have shown that body vigilance is substantially correlated with anxiety sensitivity (Deacon et al., 2003; Schmidt et al., 1997) . In the present study, however, the SHAI Body Vigilance factor was only mildly correlated with anxiety sensitivity (r = .25). In concert, these findings highlight a possible difference in the nature of body vigilance in HC as compared to in panic disorder. In panic, body vigilance involves a focus on arousal-related body sensations that is thought to arise from catastrophic beliefs about such sensations (Schmidt et al., 1997) . In contrast, body vigilance in HC may involve an increased focus on nonarousal-related signs and symptoms (e.g., lumps on the skin, joint pain) that arises from dysfunctional beliefs about illness. It is important to point out that despite the intuitive appeal of this distinction, it cannot be verified in the present study since two of the three SHAI Body Vigilance items do not explicitly refer to non-arousal-related sensations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 171, "text": "(Deacon et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 172, "end": 193, "text": "Schmidt et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 602, "end": 624, "text": "(Schmidt et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While body vigilance was the strongest predictor of safety-seeking behaviors, female gender best predicted medical utilization. For a number of reasons (e.g., regular gynecological checkups, fewer inhibitions about seeking help), it is perhaps not surprising that women reported utilizing more medical services than did men. Of the two HC-related behaviors we assessed, safety-seeking behaviors were specifically performed out of concern about one's health, whereas medical visits might have occurred for a variety of reasons. Accordingly, our results suggest that health anxiety is more important in understanding health-specific safety-seeking behaviors than medical utilization in general.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A number of limitations of this study should be noted. First, while we eliminated participants who reported that they had medical illnesses, we could not determine the extent to which medical utilization and safety-seeking behaviors were related to actual health problems. Second, the fact that only self-report data were included raises the possibility that relationships between study variables may have been inflated as a result of questionnaire-specific method variance. Third, because of the cross sectional nature of the present study, conclusions regarding links between HC-related cognition and HC-related behavior are limited to those than can be drawn from correlational data. That is, our finding of unique relationships between HC-related cognitions and HCrelated behaviors, although consistent with the cognitive-behavioral model, should not be mistaken for evidence that these dysfunctional cognitions cause an increase in medical utilization and safety maneuvers. Indeed prospective and longitudinal research is required to address the matter of reciprocal effect pathways, as are experimental studies to rule out the potential effects of third variables. Lastly, despite the fact that health anxiety significantly predicted HC-related behaviors, the majority of the variance in medical utilization and safety-seeking behaviors was left unexplained. Future research should examine the contributions of additional variables (e.g., physical symptoms, social support) that might improve our understanding of these phenomena.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, as we have alluded to further above, currently available measures of body vigilance and anxiety sensitivity do not clearly and consistently distinguish between the assessment of (a) arousal versus non-arousal-related sensations, and (b) fears of immediate versus future catastrophes. As a result, existing measures likely confound fears of these various phenomena (e.g., such as when an individual who fears that stomach discomfort will lead to cancer appears to have high anxiety sensitivity), obfuscating interpretations of scores and observed relationships between variables.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Future research in this area would benefit from the development of more specific measures of these constructs, as well as empirical investigations of the extent to which existing measures of body vigilance and anxiety sensitivity assess attention to nonarousal-related sensations and fears of developing an illness.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, results of the present study suggest that the SHAI is a reliable and valid useful measure of HC-related cognitions in healthy, non-treatment-seeking individuals. It appears to measure three cognitive domains of health anxiety, including the perceived likelihood of having an illness, anticipated negative consequences of having an illness, and body vigilance. Consistent with the cognitive-behavioral model of HC, we found that specific cognitive phenomena (the perceived likelihood of having an illness and body-focused attention) were uniquely linked with hypochondriacal behavior (medical utilization and safety-seeking). Future research is needed to identify more specific cognition-behavior links in HC (as has been done in panic disorder; e.g., Salkovskis, Clark, & Gelder, 1996) which would help clinicians better identify specific safety behaviors to be eliminated as a means of modifying catastrophic cognitions. Whereas our findings speak to factors that maintain severe health anxiety, additional research is also needed to understand variables contributing to the development of this problem. It is hoped that continued research in this area will lead to more effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of HC.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 763, "end": 797, "text": "Salkovskis, Clark,
