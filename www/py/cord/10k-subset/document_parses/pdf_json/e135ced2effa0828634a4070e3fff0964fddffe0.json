Systemic activation of the infl ammatory system after aortic injury may play a role in the development of LOI. The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of beta-blockers on systemic infl ammation and the development of LOI after distal type AAD. A total of 49 patients, who were admitted with distal type AAD and treated conservatively, were examined. White blood cell (WBC) count, serum CRP level, and arterial blood gases were measured serially. Forty patients received beta-blocker treatment within 24 h of the onset, while 9 patients received no betablocker treatment. Maximum WBC count, maximum CRP level, lowest PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) ratio, and patient background were compared between the two groups. There was no difference between the groups according to age, sex, coronary risk factors, blood pressure, serum level of CRP, WBC count, and oxygenation index on admission. Beta-blocker treatment was associated with lower maximum WBC count (P = 0.0028) and lower maximum serum CRP level (P = 0.0004). The minimum P/F ratio was higher in patients with beta-blocker treatment than in those without (P = 0.0076). Multivariate analysis revealed that administration of a betablocker was an independent negative determinant of LOI (P/F ratio \u2264200 mmHg).

Serum samples were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until CRP analysis. CRP level was measured by latex photometric immunoassay (LPIA-CRP, Mitsubishi Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) using an autoanalyzer (Hitachi 7450, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).

Aortic blood samples were obtained on admission and at least every 24 h thereafter for 5 days, and the arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 ) was measured using an automatic blood gas analyzer system (ABL-520, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). The PaO 2 /fractional inspired oxygen (P/ F) ratio was calculated to evaluate the severity of oxygenation impairment. During the acute phase, arterial blood pressure was monitored and systolic blood pressure was controlled between 100 and 120 mmHg with oral and intravenous administration of antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers, nitroglycerin, and/or beta-blockers.

Widespread severe tissue injury is sometimes complicated by SIRS, which is clinically recognized by the presence of a high body temperature, tachycardia, hyperventilation, and an increased white blood cell count. This syndrome exhibits signs of infl ammation including vasodilatation, increased microvascular permeability, and leukocyte accumulation, and is responsible for multiple organ dysfunction which leads to a high mortality.

The lung tends to be a major site of tissue damage because the pulmonary vascular bed is an important reservoir of neutrophils, storing a large amount of the total circulating neutrophil pool. 17 In fact, Furusawa et al. reported that intravenous administration of sivelestat, a specifi c neutrophil elastase inhibitor, was effective for postoperative respiratory failure in patients with AAD. 18 Alternatively, Munakata et al. reported that continuous hemodiafi ltration to remove proinfl ammatory cytokines was effective for the treatment of SIRS after operation for thoracic aortic dissection, despite slight removal of water from the continuous hemodiafi ltration. 19 However, suffi cient evidence has not been established regarding therapeutic strategies for the treatment of LOI after AAD.

The lowest P/F ratio was signifi cantly higher in patients with beta-blocker treatment than in those without, although P/F ratio on admission was similar in the two groups Effect of early use of beta-blockers on systemic infl ammatory response It is known that sympathetic activation is associated with the enhanced infl ammatory response, as well as the reninangiotensin system. Takahashi et al. reported that the plasma IL-6 level was positively correlated with the plasma level of norepinephrine after acute myocardial infarction. 20 In an in vivo study, Murray et al. revealed that myocardial expression of IL-6 was increased after chronic treatment with l-isoproterenol in the rat. 21 Previous reports have revealed that beta-blockers have an anti-infl ammatory effect and attenuate levels of infl ammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. [6] [7] [8] [9] 22 Other reports showed that some betablockers have antioxidant effects that result in substantial increments in NO bioavailability, in addition to increasing NO synthase III activation. [23] [24] [25] In particular, carvedilol is known to have antioxidant effects to inhibit the direct cytotoxic actions of reactive oxygen radicals, prevent oxygen radical induced activation of infl ammatory processes, and preserve endothelial integrity and function. [26] [27] [28] However, it was conversely reported that beta-adrenergic stimulation inhibits the production of proinfl ammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-12 in macrophages and lymphocytes through \u03b2 2 -receptors. [29] [30] [31] reported that carvedilol improved the mortality of experimental viral myocarditis possibly through increasing the production of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and reducing myocardial viral replication. They suggested that carvedilol increases the production of these cytokines by blocking \u03b2 2receptors and antioxidant effects, because reactive oxygen species are known to suppress IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. [32] [33] [34] Therefore, complex interactions exist among stress hormones and the cytokine network. The previous study showed that preexposure of mononuclear cells to epinephrine for 3 h strongly inhibited TNF-\u03b1 synthesis; however, pre-exposure to epinephrine for 24 h was associated with enhanced TNF\u03b1 synthesis, suggesting that the infl uence of epinephrine on cytokine release is determined partially by the duration of infl ammatory cell exposure to catecholamines. 29 Although these reports imply a relation between sympathetic activation and infl ammatory response, the effect of beta-blockers on the infl ammatory response in AAD has not been fully elucidated. The present study showed that beta-blockers might suppress systemic infl ammatory activation and improved LOI, resulting in a lower incidence of mechanical ventilation requirement. In this study, serum creatinine level on admission and the peak serum creatinine level during hospitalization were signifi cantly lower in patients with beta-blocker treatment than in those without. It is possible that the impaired renal function in patients without beta-blocker treatment may affect the infl ammatory response after AAD. However, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the only signifi cant predictor of LOI was lack of administration of a beta-blocker within 24 h of the onset of AAD, but not elevation of serum creatinine level (>1.2 mg/dl). ACE-I and ARB are known to have an antiinfl ammatory effect besides their reduction of blood pressure. The negative result for ACE-I or ARB administration in terms of CRP elevation and LOI development may have been caused by the fact that the ACE-I or ARB was not always administered in the acute phase of AAD. These medications were added as second-or third-line therapy when blood pressure control was inadequate. The pleiotropic effect of statin may also be benefi cial to reduce the infl ammation after AAD. However, there was no signifi cant difference in LOI and the peak CRP level between patients with and without statin administration in this study.

Second, this is a retrospective registry comparing outcomes and biochemical markers. Although hemodynamics and arterial blood gas on admission were comparable between patients with and without beta-blocker treatment, other uncontrolled factors might infl uence the results. For example, the presence of bronchial asthma or hypotension might infl uence the prevalence of LOI. In fact, patients without betablocker treatment included one patient who had a history of bronchial asthma and one patient with hypotension who had severe aortic stenosis. However, there was no difference in serum CRP level and P/F ratio on admission between patients with and without beta-blocker treatment. Moreover, the multivariate analysis revealed that beta-blocker treatment was the only independent negative determinant of the development of LOI. Third, the beta-blockers used in this study varied among patients. To assess the effect of each drug on the infl ammatory response after distal AAD, beta-blockers should be randomly selected and the dosage should be adjusted among the different drugs.
