It is generally agreed that the intestinal mucosa is immature in the newborn period at a time when it is exposed to a wealth of macromolecular antigens. 6 It also has been shown that large molecules can reach the circulation via persorption, thus coming into contact with other parts of the body where nonspecific damage might Occur, 7 especially in at-risk infants.",

Their cycle is analogous to the differentiation pathway of the precursors of intestinal IgA-producing plasma cells from B cells, which are also stimulated in the Peyer's patches. The functional properties of the gut T cells have been extensively studied? -1~ The terminal maturation of B cells is controlled in a positive fashion by helper T cells and macrophages that present not only antigens but also many polyclonal activators, including pokeweed mitogen, to B cells. A separate network of T cells, called suppressor T cells, regulates the maturation of B cells in a negative fashion. As the precursors of suppressor T cells emerge from the thymus, they are activated into the final effectors of suppression by interaction with antigens or mitogens as well as with inducer or activator cells, s' 8 ' 12 Helper and suppressor T-cell subsets are not static but remain in a state of dynamic balance via a number of complex circuits. 13 The helper T-cell subset provides help for B cells and at the same time induces a set of suppressor T cells. The suppressor T cells in turn inhibit the antibody response. This process has been called feedback suppression. 14 In both animals and humans, the majority of intraepithelial T cells have a suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype rather than a helper-inducer one. In contrast, human lamina propria T cells have mainly a helper/inducer phenotype. 15 It may take years to analyze how this complex environment affects the cellular interactions and regulatory events that determine the immune response in GALT.",

            "text": "Of the immunoregulatory mechanisms characteristic of the mucosal immune system, the best known involves the formation of suppressor T cells after oral administration of antigens. 16 An important feature of this suppressor cell response is that it may be immunoglobulin class-specific. Consequently, the suppression may affect largely IgM or IgG responses rather than IgA responses. Evidently a dual activation of helper cells for the IgA system and suppressor cells for IgM and IgG synthesis occurs. 16 In studies analyzing the regulation of mitogen-induced Ig synthesis, it was found that cloned T cells act as switch cells that induce IgM B cells (and only these cells) to differentiate into IgA B cells. Furthermore, cells bearing IgA, but not cells secreting IgA, are produced under the influence of the IgA switch T cells. Additional and different helper cells are necessary for terminal differentiation into IgA secreting cells. 17 A second mechanism of mucosal immunoregulation may involve nonspecific induction of suppressor T cells. In particular, it has been shown that bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the gastrointestinal lumen can induce a nonspecific suppression of mucosal immune responses.18 It has been proposed that in the normal gastrointestinal tract, LPS either induces suppressor cells directly, or it induces activation of cells, eg, B cells and macrophages, which in turn induce feedback suppressor T cells. 18 The exact significance of these observations and their relation to the phenomenon of oral tolerance is speculative at present.",

Soluble proteins interacting with the surface of the gut stimulate the invagination of that surface to form small vesicles. After invagination, macromolecules are transported within larger, membranebound phagosomes. Intracellular digestion occurs when lysosomes combine to form phagolysosomes. However, some macromolecules may bypass this digestive process to be released into the intercellular space by an exocytotic process and to be taken up into the circulation. Alternatively, macromolecules may cross the tight-junction barrier between cells and diffuse into the intercellular space.19 Under normal conditions, macrophages and plasma cells present in the lamina propria of the small intestine or Kupffer's cells in the liver (fixed reticuloendothelial cells) located adjacent to the portal circulation interact with absorbed antigens acting as a secondary line of defense against the penetration of antigens into the circulation. 2\u00b0 Normally, the transport of molecules results in no ill effects because of these defense mechanisms. However, when excessive quantities of antigens enter the body because of interferences with intracellular capacity to digest them, or when secondary defenses are lacking or diminished, antigens may enter the circulation and contribute to clinical diseases 6 as will be discussed later.",

Impaired peristalsis, on the other hand, allows bacterial overgrowth. Peristalsis also decreases adherence of macromolecules and their engulfment by enterocytes. 2s Moreover, pancreatic enzymes adsorbed to the surface of the small intestine enhance the breakdown of antigen-antibody complexes within the glycocalyx compartment of the gastrointestinal surface, thereby diminishing the antigens available for persorption by intestinal epithelial cells) 3 As already mentioned, reticuloendothelial cells of the liver phagocytize the noxious substances that may enter the portal circulation.

By four weeks of age, however, 92% of infants have been found to have increasing amounts of salivary IgA levels. 32 Recent studies have demonstrated that sIgA antibody levels remain relatively low only during the first six months of life. 33 In contrast, serum IgA levels increase more slowly and peak adult levels are not attained until about 10-12 years of age. 34 Thus there is a transient immunological gap during childhood, which is possibly related to enhanced macromolecular transport. Patients with selective IgA deficiency who lack sIgA and have very low levels of serum IgA are more easily exposed to the antigenic stimulus of food proteins that may penetrate the mucosa and lead to specific antibody formation. 35 It has been reported ~ that 59% of patients with selective IgA deficiency have circulating immune complexes, 50% have milk precipitins, 23% have precipitins to bovine serum, and 13% have precipitins to fetal calf serum.

In this regard, Juto et a146 have recently reported that in a group of babies with a short duration of breastfeeding and early weaning to cow's milk, an altered T-cell function was detectable before the onset of allergic manifestations. These studies indicate that atopic disease is associated with imbalances between subpopulafions of T cells. 47 The implication of these observations is that exposure to allergens in early extrauterine life when the infant is known to be particularly vulnerable to penetration by harmful intraluminal substances 6' 4L48 is accompanied by a high probability of sensitization and the subsequent development of atopic disease.",

In the light of evidence showing that bronchial hyperreactivity is ameliorated when environmental allergenicity is reduced, it is possible to consider that bronchial hyperreactivity may be secondary to allergy, at least in children. It has been suggested that repeated bronchospasm might damage bronchial muscles and nerves, thus leading to nonspecific hyperreactivity.

Early weaning seems to be of importance in subsequent sensitization to allergens. Several prospective studies done in different countries have demonstrated that early weaning is associated with an increased risk of atopic disease. On the other hand, prolonged breastfeeding exerts a prophylactic effect on the development of allergies, at least during the first years of life. 4\u00b0 It may be argued that infants are at risk of developing atopy especially during the first weeks of life. This is shown by experimental and clinical studies that have demonstrated that macromolecules can cross the intestinal mucosa at any age, the absorption being greatest in early life. 29' 3\u00b0 Rothberg 3\u00b0 reported that the absorption of bovine serum albumin in premature infants was higher than in older children.

Morphological studies done on fetal intestinal cells of the monkey and of humans showed excessive uptake of large molecules by intestinal epithelial cells. The morphological features of these cells suggested a structural immaturity. 81,82 This structural and functional immaturity can persist beyond fetal life into the neonatal period where new exposures come from without in the form of bacterial and food antigens.",
