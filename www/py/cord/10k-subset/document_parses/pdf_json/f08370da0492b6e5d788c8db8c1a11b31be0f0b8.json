The most frequent side effects are reactions at the injection site, such as swelling, erythema, warmth, and induration [2] , or mild systemic reactions, such as fatigue, malaise, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, dizziness, or rash. Recently, Allen et al. [3] described a case of cutaneous vasculitis and pulmonary alveolitis associated with bilateral basal mottling on the chest X-ray and functional data indicating a restrictive disease 2 days after the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine. The cutaneous and pulmonary inflammatory reactions were explained by a hypersensitivity illness with immune complex deposition due to the vaccine. Administration of corticosteroids produced a rapid clinical response and resolution of the symptoms [3] . Confirming these observations, a case of liver dysfunction and the appearance of DNA autoantibody [4] and two cases of autoimmune thrombocytopenia following hepatitis B vaccination were recently reported [5] . Furthermore, a case of severe acute HBV infection 2 years after full HBV vaccination occurred in a homosexual man [6] .",

            "text": "In our case, the initial symptoms were similar to those described by Allen et al. [3] . Despite negative screening for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, liver biopsy showed active hepatitis and the presence of either surface or core HBV antigens. Liver infection caused by a silent HBV mutant, not detectable by diagnostic kits for hepatitis B, has been identified [7] , and patients with acute or fulminant hepatitis and chronic hepatitis, or subjects with \"healthy\" silent HBV mutant infection, despite negative screening for hepatitis viruses, have been reported [8] . The histological feature of the liver biopsy from our patient was necroinflammation, indicating immune-mediated hepatocellular necrosis, and this was similar to specimens obtained from 14 patients in whom \"silent\" HBV infection was found [8] . Thus, we may assume that our patient was a healthy carrier of \"silent\" HBV. The presence of HBcAg in the liver shows that a virus-mediated infective hepatitis was present before vaccination. We may therefore assume that the first dose of vaccine activated the inflammation in the liver. With the second dose of vaccine, there was an excessive production of antibodies, thus giving rise to hypersensitivity and immune complex deposition. In fact, the liver biopsy specimen showed chronic lobular hepatitis with immunostaining for HBsAg also. However, the patient's transaminase values were lower than those reported by Uchida et al. [7] , suggesting that a primary immune response to hepatitis B infection in the liver could not be the only underlying cause for decompensation. Uchida et al. [7] detected hepatitis B DNA variants in 25-29% of 27 patients with either acute hepatitis or fulminant hepatic failure. It is remarkable that a patient with only slightly impaired liver function should harbor such a variant of HBV. Determination of HBV DNA in our patient's serum, which was not done because of his sudden death, would have clarified these unexplained aspects.",

IgE, IgG, and IgM, complement fractions (C3 and C4), and deposition of HBsAg and HBcAg were found in the lungs at postmortem examination. An acute inflammatory reaction was also found in the kidney, with positive staining for HBsAg and HBcAg. The consequent activation of complement and the release of cytotoxic substances from the neutrophils may thus explain ARDS with no recognized infective focus [9, 10] . Under these circumstances, a brief cause of treatment with corticosteroids would be indicated for life-threatening organ dysfunction, despite the risk of exacerbating a possible HIV infection.",
