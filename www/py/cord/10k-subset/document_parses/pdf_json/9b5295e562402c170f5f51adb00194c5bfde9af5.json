Patients with high positive aCL antibodies may have more frequent thrombo-occlusive events after cerebral ischemia [18] . It is therefore recommended that such patients receive oral vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, in order to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) within the recommended therapeutic range. A beneficial role for anticoagulants in decreasing the rate of recurrent thrombosis has been shown in several retrospective studies [19, 20, 21] . Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is monitored by the prothrombin time and the international normalized ratio (INR). In general, ther-apy with oral anticoagulants targeted at an INR of 2.5 is very effective as it reduces the risk of recurrent thromboembolism by 90-95% [22] . This approach also holds for patients with the hereditary thrombophilias [23] . In patients with lupus anticoagulants who have sustained a thromboembolic event the recommended INR for oral anticoagulation is controversial.
