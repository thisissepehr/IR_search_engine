This vaccination strategy has the advantages of genetic vaccination (easy production, adaptability to any disease and inexpensive storage when lyophilized), but not the drawbacks of DNA vaccination (long-term uncontrolled expression of a transgene, possibility of integration into the host genome and possible induction of anti-DNA antibodies). We report here that injection of naked b-globin untranslated region (UTR)-stabilized mRNA coding for b-galactosidase is followed by detectable translation in vivo. In addition, we show that such a vaccination strategy primes a T helper 2 (Th2) type of response which can be enhanced and shifted to a Th1-type immune response by application of recombinant granulocyte/macrophage colonystimulating factor 1 day after mRNA injection.

Moreover, the appearance of new pathogens, as illustrated by the SARS epidemics, as well as current fears of bioterrorism require new vaccines that are efficient, versatile, quickly and inexpensively engineered and that can be easily stored. Genetic vaccinations comprising of the injection of naked plasmid DNA were first documented in mice in the early 1990s and were envisioned as the new vaccination method meeting these needs [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Unfortunately, results of phase I/II human trials indicated * Corresponding author. that this technology is not as efficient in humans as in mice [6] . Furthermore DNA vaccination has potential safety drawbacks [7, 8] . The injected recombinant molecules must reach the nucleus (this step might actually limit the efficiency of the DNA vaccination) where they might recombine with host genes. Integration of foreign DNA might interfere with host gene expression and eventually trigger the expression of an oncogene or disrupt a tumor suppressor gene. Moreover, the ability of the DNA molecule to persist for a very long time in the nucleus (as an episome or integrated) may result in the infinite production of the transgenic protein and could lead to tolerance. It also prevents the utilization of cytokine-expressing nucleic acids. Additionnaly, injection of DNA may trigger the development of anti-DNA antibodies [9] and the induction of autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 731, "end": 734, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 735, "end": 738, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 739, "end": 742, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 743, "end": 746, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 747, "end": 750, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 899, "end": 902, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 964, "end": 967, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 968, "end": 970, "text": "8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1672, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "These potential risks associated with genetic vaccination are not relevant when mRNA is used instead of DNA. Providing the fundamentals for all life functions (storage of genetic information, regulation of gene expression, enzymatic activity and scaffold structure), RNA has also been used as a tool to induce antigen-specific immunity [10] [11] [12] . In this context, some researchers developed immunization strategies based on self-replicating RNA coding for both an antigen and a viral RNA replicase [13, 14] . Such a method shows efficiency but is limited by safety concerns related to the use of viral RNA replicases in a genetic vaccine (recombination between the injected RNA and endogenous RNA leading to the formation of new types of a-viruses cannot be excluded). Other researchers have focused their work on protecting the nucleic acid from degradation mediated by the abundant ribonucleases using liposomes [15] , or intracytosolic in vivo delivery with a ballistic device (gene gun) [16] or ex vivo methods (transfection of dendritic cells) [12] . In the course of such studies, we have shown that intraear pinna [14] injection of naked b-globin untranslated region (UTR)-stabilized mRNA induces a specific immune response against the antigen coded by the mRNA [17] . Protection against exogenous RNases, achieved by simple condensation of the mRNA with a cationic peptide such as protamine, makes the vaccine more stable but was not required. Similar results were also published by Granstein et al. [18] . We further studied this vaccination strategy and developed its production through the implementation of a good manufacturing practice (GMP) facility for large-scale production of pharmaceutical-grade mRNA to be used in human clinical trials. We studied the fate of the injected globin UTR-stabilized mRNA and the type of immune response it triggers. In addition, we tested the capacity of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the cytokine that shows an optimal adjuvant effect in the context of DNA vaccines [19, 20] , to enhance the mRNA-induced immune response.

Sixteen hours later, animals were sacrificed; ears were removed and cut into sections using a cryomicrotome. Sections were fixed and incubated with an optimized X-galcontaining solution at 37\u00b0C overnight. After such treatment, cells expressing b-galactosidase turned blue. In ears injected with buffer, some endogenous b-galactosidase activity could be detected in the hair follicles that were clearly identified by their location next to the surface of the skin and by their structure in which a hair could be seen ( fig. 1 A, open arrowheads) . In contrast, specific staining of some cells was detectable in the der- 1 ). Blue cells were located on the external side of the ear which could be recognized by the thickness between the epidermis and the cartilage (in the internal side there are only a few layers of cells between the cartilage and the epidermis). On average, as many blue cells could be seen in the ear sections as from DNA-injected mice ( fig. 1) . The strong limitation imposed on plasmid expression by the nuclear membrane might account for the relatively comparable number of blue cells observed when a very stable (DNA) or an unstable (RNA) but cytosolically active nucleic acid is injected. One can also not exclude that the observed blue cells expressed a receptor allowing uptake and translation of exogenous RNA in vivo. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that stabilized mRNAs activate dendritic cells through their interaction with a Toll-like receptor (TLR), showing for the first time that highly developed organisms have learnt to recognize singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) [23] . We do not know yet the identity of the blue cells detected in ear sections from bgalactosidase-encoding mRNA-injected mice. The fixation of the sections before overnight incubation with Xgal as well as the interference of the X-gal staining solution with fluorescence in a confocal microscope has so far prevented the identification of such cells by monoclonal antibody staining. Neither with DNA nor with mRNA injection could we unambiguously detect blue cells in the draining lymph nodes (data not shown).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1997, "end": 2001, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 918, "end": 944, "text": "fig. 1 A, open arrowheads)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1020, "text": "1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1364, "text": "fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Knowing that injected naked stabilized mRNA is translated and that a specific immune response can be detected [17], we studied such an antigen-specific immune response in more detail.

In BALB/c mice which received naked stabilized mRNA, the dominant isotype of b-galactosidase-specific antibodies in responding mice was IgG1 ( fig. 2 ; see also fig. 3 ).

Interestingly, ssRNA is now known to trigger immunostimulation through a TLR-dependent pathway [23] . TLR-7 (in mice) and TLR-8 (in humans) recognize ssRNA [24, 25] . We have shown that, when used as adjuvant in the context of protein-based vaccination, ssRNA induces a Th2-type response [23] . We hypothesize from all these experiments and data that injection of naked ssRNA in mice induces through TLR-7 a signal that directs the immune system towards a Th2 type of immunity.

GM-CSF increases the density of dendcitic cells in the skin and in doing so There is uncertainty about the optimal timing of GM-CSF injection to achieve an efficient adjuvant effect [21] . We decided to apply GM-CSF either 1 day or 2 h before or 1 day after mRNA injection. Looking at all the parameters of the immune response (class of anti-b-galactosidase antibodies shown in fig. 3 A, cytokine release by cultured splenocytes shown in fig. 3 B and cytolytic activity by CD8-positive cells shown in fig. 3 C) , we found that injection of GM-CSF 1 day before mRNA injection ( fig. 3,  table 1 , group GM-CSF T-1) did not significantly affect the quality or quantity of the b-galactosidase-specific immune response: the amount and type of immunoglobulin against b-galactosidase was equivalent to that seen after injection of mRNA alone ( fig. 3 A) ; this was true also for cytokine production ( fig. 3 B) and cytolytic activity ( fig. 3 C) of splenocytes from injected mice which were restimulated in vitro with the purified b-galactosidase protein. We should note here that the cytotoxic activity shwon after vaccination with naked b-globin UTRstabilized mRNA by Hoerr et al. [17] was revealed by in vitro stimulation using the dominant b-galactosidase-de-rived epitope presented by H2-L d (the peptide TPH-PARIGL). In the present report, the in vitro stimulation of splenocytes was made with the whole b-galactosidase protein and should activate both helper and cytotoxic memory T cells. We can conclude from these results that a systemic enrichment of the skin with dendritic cells has no favorable impact on the efficiency of the mRNAbased vaccine. This suggests that using our vaccination strategy, the number of dendritic cells at the site of injection is not a main limiting factor for the development of the immune response. Injection of GM-CSF shortly (2 h) before the mRNA also had no strong impact on the anti-b-galactosidase immune response ( fig. 3, table 1 , group GM-CSF T0). In contrast, the injection of GM-CSF 24 h after the injection of mRNA ( fig. 3, table 1 , group GM-CSF T+1) enhanced the Th2 response slightly ( fig. 3 B) and, most importantly, induced a Th1-type immunity as shown by dominant anti-b-galactosidase IgG2a antibody production ( fig. 3 A) , production of IFN-g by b-galactosidase-stimulated splenocytes ( fig.  3 B) and recall of cytotoxic activity in these in vitro culture conditions (stimulation with the entire b-galactosi- (table 1) . A Th1 type of immunity is preferred for vaccines that should trigger an antivirus or an antitumor immune response. Such an immune response switch induced by GM-CSF was actually previously documented in the context of genetic vaccination: ballistic delivery of DNA into the dermis (through a gene gun) triggers a Th2-type response that can be switched to Th1 by GM-CSF delivery after DNA injection [28] . The mechanisms underlying such a phenomenon are not known. The combination of mRNA vaccination with GM-CSF as an adjuvant is currently being tested in the context of antitumor immune responses in stage 3 and 4 melanoma patients. The potential of total tumor mRNA libraries is being studied in this context. Since globin UTR-stabilized mRNA is a safe (naturally catabolized, cannot interact with the host genome, does not lead to uncontrolled long-term expression and cannot induce autoantibodies; furthermore, mRNA is produced in vitro using synthetic or bacteria-derived products and can be heated before injection: it should not be contaminated by harmful proteins or viruses) and versatile vehicle for vaccination whose price as a pharmaceutical product (GMP grade) is similar to other delivery methods (DNA, peptides, proteins: the price of a GMP product depends mainly on the cost of the facilities and the certification and quality controls and does not depend much on the cost of biochemical reagents), we anticipate that it will attract considerable interest in the near future.

Sixteen h after injection, mice were sacrificed, ears were shaved, removed and frosted in embedding medium.

On the x-axis is the length of the ear that was analyzed (the 0 was arbitrarily assigned to the first section that shows blue cells; in buffer-injected mice, the 2-mm ear array at the injection site was analyzed and the 0 was arbitrarily set): each section was 50 mm and consequently several consecutive sections cover a total distance of a few millimeters. On each diagram (buffer-injected mice, mRNA-injected mice or DNA injected mice), the two sections highlighted by a star and a gray box are those shown on the accompanying microscopy pictures.

GM-CSF (a total of 2 mg recombinant protein; ca 10 4 units) was injected once 24 or 2 h before the mRNA or once 24 h after the mRNA (groups GM-CSF T-1, GM-CSF TO and GM-CSF T+1, respectively).

The background which is the mean result obtained with the serum from buffer-injected mice at the same dilution is subtracted. (B) The in vitro reactivation of T cells by b-galactosidase was examined using cytokine detection at day 4 of culture. IFNg and IL-4 content in the supernatant of the splenocytes culture was measured by ELISA. (C) The cytotoxic activity of splenocytes cultured in the presence of purified b-galactosidase for 6 days was tested in a chromium release assay. Target cells were P815 (H2 d ) cells loaded () or not loaded () with the synthetic peptide TPHPARIGL corresponding to the dominant H2-L d epitope of b-galactosidase. sient expression of the proteins by exogenous b-globin UTR-stabilized mRNA makes it a suitable short-lived cytokine delivery vehicle) may further modulate the immunity induced by mRNA vaccination. Thus, vaccination with naked globin UTR-stabilized mRNA is a versatile and safe method for the induction of immunity against various kinds of diseases.Acknowledgements.
