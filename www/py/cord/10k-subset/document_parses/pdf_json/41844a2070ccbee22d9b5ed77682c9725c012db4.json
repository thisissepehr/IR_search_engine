Method: Grading based on the counting of PDC was assessed in 108 surgical colorectal MACs. PDC represented clusters composed of \u2265 5 cancer cells with no glandular formation in the tumour stroma and at its invasive edge. MACs with <5, 5 to 9, and \u226510 clusters were classified as G1, G2 and G3 by two independent pathologists blinded to the clinico-pathological data. The inter-observer agreement and prognostic significance of PDC grade were compared with those of a grading system based on glandular differentiation. Results: PDC grade was more reproducible and significantly associated with disease progression (P = 0.0089) as well as with death from MAC (P = 0.0035), as compared to the grade based on glandular differentiation which was not associated with any of the clinico-pathological variables. Moreover, PDC grade emerged as a significant, independent prognostic factor of recurrence free survival (P = 0.0198) and cancer specific survival (P = 0.0293) in MAC. Conclusion: PDC grading is feasible, reproducible and prognostically relevant in MAC, which may support its use in routine practice.",

Since ITB and PTB are highly correlated, we aimed to assess the clinical relevance of an 'overall' tumour budding (OTB) score. Method: Pan-cytokeratin stained slides from 156 well-characterized stage I-IV CRC patients were evaluated: OTB was scored as 10 densest out of 20 high-power fields (HPF) of ITB and PTB. OTB scores were correlated with clinicopathological features and survival using a ROC curve based cut-off (10 buds/HPF; high/low-grade OTB) and continuous OTB counts.",

OTB scores independently correlated with poor survival outcome (HR (95 %CI): 1.02, CI: 1.0002-1.04, p = 0.03) when adjusted for TNM-stage and adjuvant therapy. Conclusion: OTB is a strong adverse prognostic parameter, capturing associations with metastasis and survival. It includes the densest regions of tumour budding irrespective of intra-or peritumoral location and simplifies the 10HPF/1HPF scoring system.",

            "text": "Objective: To assess the usefulness of colonic adenomas as samples for the study of mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression loss when trying to identify individuals with suspected Lynch syndrome (LS). Method: We studied a series of 61 colonic adenomas from 22 proven mutation carriers (8 females and 14 males) belonging to 16 LS families. Germline mutations were present in MLH1 in 6 cases, MSH2 in 8, MSH6 in 1, and EPCAM in 1. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were used. MMR protein expression was assessed with the aid of anti-hMLH1, anti-hMSH2, and anti-hMSH6 mouse monoclonal antibodies. Results: Twenty-seven conventional adenomas (CAs), 22 sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), 4 traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs), and eight hyperplastic polyps (HPs) measuring 0.1-2.2 cm were studied. High-grade dysplasia (HGD) was observed in 33 cases. Loss of MMR protein expression was identified in 34 cases and, in agreement with underlying germline mutations, it involved MLH1 in 9 instances, MSH2 in 24, and MSH6 in 1. Of these 34 informative polyps, 25 (74 %) showed HGD (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Colonic adenomas are useful samples for the assessment of MMR protein expression when LS is suspected. Results are particularly rewarding when colonic adenomas exhibit high-grade dysplasia.",

Method: We have studied the immunohistochemical expression of P38 in colorectal adenomas on tissue microarrays. Protein expression was studied with regard to morphological adenoma features and, to the expression of Ki67 and CD133 by the Kendall rank-correlation test. Results: P38 was expressed in 81.6 % of colorectal adenomas. Nuclear P38 correlated to male gender (p < 0.01/tau = 0.157), to a decreased stromal component (0.02/\u22120.140), to low-grade dysplasia (<0.01/ \u22120.254) and to decreased size (<0.01/\u22120.267). Nuclear and/or cytoplasmic P38 (global P38) correlated to presence of multiple adenomas (<0.01/ 0.198), low-grade dysplasia (<0.01/\u22120.158), decreased mucosecretion (0.01/\u22120.143) and to a decreased extent of the stromal component (0.02/\u22120.131). Nuclear and cytoplasmic P38 were correlated (<0.01/ 0.315). Nuclear P38 correlated to nuclear or cytoplasmic CD133 (<0.01/0.213 and <0.01/0.293). Conclusion: The results of this study showing a correlation between P38 and a decreased adenoma size, as well as low-grade dysplasia, suggest a role for P38 in the initial steps morphogenesis of colorectal adenomas. The correlation to the stem-cell-marker CD133, known to belong to the quiescent cell compartment, are in agreement with an interference with tumour dormancy.",

Macroscopic processing usually uses parallel lateral sections. We recently developed an approach using perpendicular lateral sections, hypothesizing that it decreases false positive lateral margins. We aimed to test false positive rates of lateral margins in a series of colorectal ESD, depending on section method. Method: We studied 182 ESD specimens. Parallel section was used from 2006 to 2009 (n = 55). Perpendicular lateral section was used from 2010 to 2014 (n = 127). We recorded the number of positive margins, along with grade of dysplasia or carcinoma. Patient outcomes (local recurrence and disease-free survival) were also observed. Results: 29/55 (52.7 %) margins were positive for parallel sections. Of these, 5 cases harbored high grade dysplasia (HGD), and one carcinoma. In contrast, perpendicularly cut margins were significantly less frequently positive: 38/127 (29.9 %) (p = 0.003). Two had HGD and none carcinoma. Overall, no patients showed local recurrence during long-term follow-up, thereby defining all positive margins as false positives. Conclusion: Our specimen handling method, with perpendicular section of lateral margins, appears to significantly decrease false positive rates in colorectal ESD specimens. While this technique may require complex handling, it may reduce unnecessary surgeries.",

Here we focus on the role of stromal-cells in the tumour progression. Method: Factors involved in Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT) (including SNAIL1, ZEB1, ZEB2) and tumoursuppressors (SMAD4 and PTEN) were assessed by mRNA-insitu-Hybridization (mRNA-ISH) and immunostaining on multipunch tissue-microarrays containing 120 well-characterized PDACs with special attention to stromal-cells. Additionally, microRNA-profiling after RNA-isolation from material obtained from juxta-tumoural and tumour-remote stroma after Laser-Capture-Microdissection by using qRT-PCR for specific microRNA-sequences was undertaken. Results: Stromal-cells surrounding EMT-Type-tumour-budding-cells express high-levels of SNAIL1, ZEB1 and ZEB2 and show frequent PTENloss and chromosome-10 deletion, this being associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.0045). High-levels of SMAD4 in stromal-cells are associated with larger tumour size (p = 0.0112) and worse overall-survival (p = 0.021). miRNA-profiling shows a differential expression between juxta-tumoural and tumour-remote stroma concerning miR-21, miR-210, miR-203 and miR-200b. Conclusion: Stromal-cells seem to play an important role in PDAC progression, especially by supporting EMT-type-tumour-budding and distant metastasis. We could additionally show that juxta-tumoural stroma differentially regulates miRNA in addition to harboring genetic changes in tumour-suppressor genes. Better understanding of the role of the cancer stroma will be detrimental in developing novel targeted and individualized therapeutic approaches.",

It is controversial whether all mucinous tumours are high grade, or whether a high pathological grade show only be conferred on microsatellite stable mucinous carcinoma. We investigated whether MSI was associated with improved survival outcomes in CRC patients with mucinous histology. Method: In a cohort of 264 patients with mucinous CRC treated at our institution during the period 1998-2011, 5-year survival rates were compared for MSI and microsatellite stable tumours. We also calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for mortality using Cox regression, adjusting for age, gender, tumour grade and MSI. Results: Mean age was 74 years (range 20-103 years), and 107 (40.5 %) were male. MSI was found in 95 (36.0 %) of mucinous tumours. The 5year survival rate was significantly higher in patients with MSI compared with those with microsatellite stable tumours (73 % versus 58 %, p = 0.035).

Method: We analyzed CEA, CA19-9, and CA125 protein expression immunohistochemically from 92 appendix-derived PMPs. CA19-9 negative/weak cases were further sequenced for the mutational hotspot positions of the biosynthetic enzyme fucosyl transferase 3 (FUT3). Results: All tumours were CEA immunopositive. The staining was predominantly apical, but in five aggressive high-grade tumours containing signet ring cells, an intense immunostaining was found in all tumour cell membranes. The preoperative serum CEA levels of these cases were normal and the patients died within 5 years after diagnosis. CA19-9 showed strong positive staining in most of the tumours (90 %). From the negative/weak cases, the mutational status of the FUT3 gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. CA125 was infrequently expressed by PMP tumour cells, but in most of the cases (79 %) adjacent nonneoplastic mesothelial cells showed immunopositivity. Conclusion: CEA is invariably expressed by PMP tumour cells, whereas CA125 seems to be mostly expressed by adjacent mesothelium. Importantly, we found five aggressive PMP tumours showing intense CEA immunostaining without increase in serum levels. This may limit the prognostic value of serum CEA measurements.",

This study investigates the immunohistochemical SSTR2A and SSTR5 profiles of NECs and NETs G3 including their molecular TP53 status. Method: Surgical resection specimens of 33 NECs (Ki67-index >20 %) of different origin (pancreas/ampulla, colorectum, bladder, parotid gland, merkel cell carcinoma of the skin) and 6 NETs G3 (Ki67-index >20 %) of pancreatic (n = 4) and colorectal (n = 2) origin were examined by immunohistochemistry (synaptophysin, chromogranin A, Ki-67, CD56, p53, progesterone receptor, CK20, SSTR2A, SSTR5). Molecular analysis (TP53, exon 5-9, by direct sequencing) was done in 24 NECs and 4 NETs G3. Results: 4/6 NETs G3 and 5/33 NECs are SSTR2A positive. 22/33 NECs are p53 positive. SSTR2A positive NETs G3 are p53 negative. 2/4 NETs G3 and 12/24 NECs are TP53 mutated. Conclusion: SSTR2A expression occurs also in NECs, however rarely.

Guidance on how to measure adenomas is lacking. Our aim was to compare endoscopy and pathology sizing in a large series of adenomas. Method: Endoscopy and pathology sizes available from intact adenomas removed at colonoscopies performed as part of the Northern Ireland Bowel Cancer Screening Program, from 2010 to 2014, were included in this study. Chi-squared tests were applied to compare size categories in relation to clinicopathological parameters. Results: 2352 adenomas from 1465 individuals were included. Significantly greater size rounding or 'terminal digit preference' was evident in endoscopy v. pathology sizing (30 % v. 19 %, p < 0.001). There was a trend towards larger endoscopy than pathology sizing in four of the five study centers. Applying a 10 mm cut-off, 6.9 % of all adenomas, and 27.2 % of those 8-12 mm in size, had discordant endoscopy and pathology sizes, with consequent change in surveillance stratification for 8.8 % of individuals. Conclusion: Pathology size of adenomas is more accurate than endoscopy size and should be used to determine appropriate surveillance intervals. Use of endoscopy size increases the burden on surveillance colonoscopy. Objective: Since cholelithiasis and cholecystitis are main risk factors for gall bladder carcinoma (GBC), inflammation-driven signaling pathways such as the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways might be of interest for investigating the carcinogenesis of GBC. Method: Several members of the STAT pathway were analyzed by immunohistochemistry on tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) containing 396 gallbladder carcinomas and 137 non-neoplastic tissue samples. Furthermore the STAT pathway was analyzed by Western blot using eight different gallbladder cancer cell lines. Furthermore in vivo experiments with Xenograft mouse models were conducted. Results: Our data highlight a potentially clinically significant association between an IL-6/IL-6R-and STAT3-mediated signaling cascade as the nuclear expression of STAT3 revealed staining of high intensity in more than 40 % of all cases investigated. Most of our study cases coprised GBCs with a high positive cytoplasmic staining intensity for IL-6R (99 %). STAT1 was upregulated in a small fraction of the cohort. Conclusion: An IL-6/IL-6-R-and STAT3-driven signaling cascade is suggested as being critically involved in the development of GBC. Thus, STAT3, especially phosphorylated STAT3, might serve as reliable predictor for an IL-6-or STAT3-targeted therapy of GBC patients. Method: 78 ERs from 50 Australian patients were reviewed. Semiquantitative assessment of presence and extent of GC was done by dividing length of CLM on each hematoxylin & eosin stained section into 1 mm segments as estimated by a 20x objective field. Fields with GCs were aggregated per case as a percentage of the total length of all segments of CLM examined. The extent of GC was correlated with the neoplastic phenotype and grade. Results: 96 % (48/50) of patients and 91 % (71/78) of specimens showed GC. GC were present in 90 % (10/11), 95 % (38/40), 86 % (18/21) of intestinal, mixed and foveolar morphologic phenotypes respectively. Average extent of GC in intestinal, mixed, and foveolar morphologic phenotypes was 57, 46 and 23 % respectively. Immunophenotype was concordant with morphologic examination in 59 % (23/39) patients. Average extent of GC in low grade intraepithelial neoplasia, high grade intraepithelial neoplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma/oesophageal adenocarcinoma was 40, 42 and 42 % respectively. Objective: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized basically by altered gut motility. Serotonin is a signaling molecule that plays a critical role in regulation of gastrointestinal motility. This study was performed to investigate the serotonin-positive cell count as well as serotonin-selective reuptake transporter (SERT) expression in the colon of IBS patients. Method: The study included 40 IBS patients, 14 were diarrheapredominant (IBS-D), 20 were constipation-predominant (IBS-C) and 6 had mixed symptoms (IBS-M). In addition, 20 healthy subjects were included as controls. Colonoscopy was performed on all patients and controls. Biopsies were immunostained for serotonin and SERT. Results: Mean serotonin-positive cell count in biopsies of total IBS patients, IBS-D, IBS-C and IBS-M was 27.93 \u00b1 6.455, 31.92 \u00b1 7.065, 25.40 \u00b1 5.5 and 27 \u00b1 2.966 cells/10 HPF respectively, while that of control was 43.05 \u00b1 8.54 cells/10 HPF. Serotonin-positive cell count was significantly lower in total IBS patients than control subjects (p = 0.001). SERT immunoreactivity score was significantly lower in the colonic biopsies of total IBS patients, IBS-D, IBS-C and IBS-M than control subjects (p = 0.021, 0.0115, 0.017 and 0.008 respectively).

Diffuse strong cytoplasmic p62 immunostaining was only observed in HCC. BEC showed occasional mild cytoplasmic p62 immunoreactivity independent of specimen/disease type. Conclusion: p62 subcellular topography shows diversity depending on specimen type or liver disease. Panacinar hepatocyte nuclear p62 in autopsy liver maybe a death-related phenomenon while strong isolated cytoplasmic p62 in acute hepatitis may indicate underlying acute cell stress. Diffuse strong cytoplasmic p62 immunoreactivity maybe a marker for malignancy.",

Haemmig, M. Neuenschwander, I. Zlobec, E. Vassella, A. Perren, E. Karamitopoulou Objective: Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) encompasses a spectrum of precursor and invasive lesions. We aimed to characterize the morphology of early and advanced HDGCs and investigate the relationship between morphology and biomarkers of cell-adhesion, proliferation, anoikis, epithelial-mesenchymaltransition and cancer cell stemness. Method: Twenty-one lesions from 17 HDGC patients encompassing 12 intramucosal carcinomas (pT1a) and 9 widely invasive carcinomas (pT>1) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin, Ki67, Bcl-2, p53, pSrc and ALDH1A. Results: All pT1a lesions showed typical signet ring cells (SRCs), absence of p53 and Ki-67 expression. In contrast, pT>1 carcinomas were composed by a mixture of SRCs and pleomorphic cells, characterized by high Ki-67 proliferation index (89 %) and p53 overexpression (56 %) in the pleomorphic component. Ecadherin immunoexpression was heterogeneous, from absent/ decreased to cytoplasmic. Expression of ALDH1 and pSrc decreased from early (100 and 58 %, respectively) to advanced carcinomas (44 and 33 %, respectively). Bcl-2 was expressed only in one case. Conclusion: We verified that early HDGCs present with an \"indolent\" phenotype (SRCs; Ki67-; p53-), while advanced carcinomas display an \"aggressive\" phenotype (pleomorphic cells; Ki67+; p53+). This is the first evidence of phenotypic heterogeneity in HDGC lesions and may help define predictive biomarkers of progression from indolent to widely invasive carcinomas.",

Carvalho * Objective: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are consequence of aerobic respiration. Oxidative stress induces high levels of ROS that damage DNA. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a group of enzymes responsible for ROS detoxification. SOD2 and SOD3 polymorphisms are associated with ROS levels and may influence colorectal carcinoma (CRC) development. This study aimed to evaluate the association between common polymorphisms of SOD2 and SOD3 genes and CRC. Method: FFPE non-tumoural colonic mucosa of 100 CRC biopsies was compared with blood samples of 100 healthy controls as a case-control study. SOD2 V16A and SOD3 H63R polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-SSP, through commercially available kits. Results: Our results showed that SOD2 16A (58 vs 40 %, P < 0.01; OR = 2.1; 95 % CI 1.2 to 3.6) and SOD3 63R (60 vs 43 %, P < 0.05; OR = 2.0; 95 % CI 1.1 to 3.5) mutated alleles were prevalent among CRC cases while the normal alleles where prevalent among control group. Conclusion: SOD2 and SOD3 mutated forms were related with enzymatic activity decrease which correlates with ROS levels increase and consequently CRC higher risk. Our results corroborate the potential role of oxidative stress in CRC development and provide insight into the potential pathogenesis of SOD2 and SOD3 common polymorphisms in CRC predisposal.",

While it has been demonstrated that chromosomal instability is the leading form of genomic instability in ulcerative colitis-associated CRCs, it remains vague for CD-associated CRCs. Method: We applied microsatellite PCR, mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry, high-resolution array comparative hybridization (aCGH) and targeted next generation sequencing to formalinfixed paraffin-embedded CRC samples from 17 different patients suffering from CD. If available, we included precursor lesions and inflamed mucosa. Results: All 17 patients were diagnosed with CRC at a relatively young age (mean 47 years) compared to what one would expect in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis and had a long history of CD. Histologically the CD-associated CRCs were adenocarcinomas, frequently displaying mucinous and/or signet ring cell components. While CRCs with this phenotype are often located in the right-sided colon and are typically microsatellite instable, all analyzed CD-associated CRCs weredespite their mucinous histologymicrosatellite stable. Consistently, aCGH data showed chromosomal aberration patterns similar to those known from sporadic CRC following the chromosomal instability pathway. Conclusion: While a high percentage of mucinous CRCs demonstrates microsatellite instability, none of the CD-associated CRCs was microsatellite instable. Accordingly, genomic profiling of CD-associated CRCs argues for an active chromosomal instability pathway. A detailed molecular analysis showed major differences between sporadic mucinous CRCs and CD-associated CRCs. Objective: To describe the cytological, clinical and radiological findings in patients with suspected breast cancer recurrence after lipofilling. Method: We included all patients who underwent fine needle aspiration at our Institution from January 2009 to December 2014 with a clinical and/or radiological suspicion of breast cancer recurrence after lipofilling. Results: Thirty-two breast lesions were studied from 27 patients (mean age: 52,8 \u00b1 8,5) who underwent lipofilling after mastectomy (81,2 %) or wide local excision (18,1 %). Suspicious lesions appeared after a mean period of 5,2 years after surgery, were mostly located under the previous scar and measured 3-60 mm in diameter (mean diameter: 16,2 mm). Six out of 23 lesions were detected at mammography; 31/32 lesions were detected at ultrasound and 5/5 lesions were detected at MRI. At cytological examination most cases showed steatonecrotic debris (75 %), variably associated to macrophages both isolated (59,3 %) and/or in clusters (28,1 %), adipocytes (43 %), multinucleated giant cells (25 %), and lipophages (18 %). Atypical epithelial cells were described in 4/32 cases (12,5 %) , however only in 2/4 cases a diagnosis of cancer was confirmed on histology. Conclusion: The cytological diagnosis of breast cancer recurrence after lipofilling is challenging, since clusters of epithelioid macrophages could be easily misdiagnosed as atypical epithelial cells. Objective: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (EUS-FNAC) is the most common procedure to obtain cytological specimen of pancreas nowadays. It is minimally invasive, safe and cost-effective. However, discrepancy in cytological and histologic diagnosis sometimes happens. This study was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNAC of pancreas. Method: A retrospective study was performed on 191 cases of pancreatic lesions initially diagnosed by EUS-FNAC with following histological diagnosis between 2010 and 2012 in Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital. Cytologic and surgical diagnoses were categorized into five groups: 'Negative', 'benign', 'atypical', 'malignant' and 'insufficient for diagnosis (IFD)'. Subsequently, 167 cases with diagnosis in both examinations were statistically analyzed for the correlations. Results: In comparison with surgical diagnosis, cytologic diagnosis were true-positive in 103 cases (61.7 %), true-negative in 28 cases (16.8 %) , false positive in 9 cases (5.4 %) and false negative in 27 cases (16.1 %). The diagnostic accuracy was 78.4 %, sensitivity was 79.2 % and specificity was 75.7 %. Although negative predictive value was 50.9 %, positive predictive value was 92.0 %. Conclusion: Though several limitations exist, EUS-FNAC is a useful and reliable diagnostic tool for evaluation of pancreas lesion.",

Mendes de Almeida Method: We used tumour imprints or routine bone marrow smears of 20 patients after fixation with formaldehyde vapor. Images were obtained with a confocal microscope equipped with a HPM-100-40 Hybrid detector and 405 nm pulsed diode laser. Results: In all cases we obtained highly contrasted FLIM images, with clearly distinguishable cellular elements. The obtained shapes and textures permitted to recognize the different cell types. Red blood cells were characterized by the short lifetimes of their hemoglobin component. Cytoplasm and the protein background showed intermediate lifetime values. Fluorescence lifetime of the nuclei of the granulopoetic precursors was considerably longer than in nuclei of erythroblasts. Leukemic blasts of several types of acute leukemia showed considerable variation, generally long lifetime values. In one case of Chediak-Higachi disease, the pathologic cytoplasmic granula were clearly distinguishable. Moreover in that case, intracytoplasmic bacteria could be identified, which were not well visible in the routine cytologic preparations. Conclusion: The FLIM technique can be applied in routinely acquired unstained cytologic material. The images are contrasted and permit to identify cellular elements. Different lifetime values of nuclear chromatin suggest physicochemical differences of the nuclear organization.",

Results: Nuclear immunoreactivity for ZEB1 was detected in both epithelial and stromal tumour cells (83/86 and 77/86 respectively). ZEB1 expression was significantly higher in borderline/malignant tumours (p = 0.003 for epithelial and p < 0.001 for stromal cells). ZEB1 immunoreactivity was correlated to significantly higher loss of epithelial membranous E-cadherin (p = 0.003 for epithelial and p < 0.001 for stromal cells) and to significantly higher nuclear/cytoplasmic expression of ILK (p = 0.005/p = 0.001 respectively for epithelial cells and p = 0.001/ p = 0.007 for stromal cells). Conclusion: ZEB1 is overexpressed in borderline/malignant tumours and is correlated to loss of epithelial marker E-cadherin and to expression of EMT-inducer ILK.

Tumour elastosis was graded as 0-3. Lymphatic vessel involvement (LVI) and blood vessel invasion (BVI) were recorded separately based on immunohistochemical staining (D2-40 and CD31 antibodies). Results: High content of elastosis was inversely associated with LVI (OR 2.5; p = 0,028) and BVI (OR 3.6; p = 0,038). In univariate survival analyses, low or absent elastosis with BVI positive cases demonstrated significantly reduced recurrence free survival compared to BVI negative cases (p = 0,002). The same trend was seen for LVI positive cases with low or absent elastosis compared to LVI negative cases (p = 0.093). Among tumours with high content of elastosis, no survival differences between positive or negative tumours for BVI or LVI were found. Conclusion: There is an inverse association between the presence of tumour elastosis and vascular invasion in breast cancers. Absent or low content of elastosis with positive BVI is associated with poor prognosis.",

By recording a unique optical signature to analyze the chemical make-up of a biopsy quantitatively, the technique is unaffected by the subjectivity of traditional grading. Within minutes of loading a slide it yields a highly reproducible and user independent numerical score reflecting the cellularity of the tumour and its nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio. We report here our findings using an objective technique to grade breast tumours using quantitative criteria. Method: H&E stained sections from excision biopsies of 105 cases of invasive breast carcinoma were reviewed and graded using the Elston-Ellis grading system. Unstained sections from each case were loaded into the Digistain platform to yield a numerical score -the Digistain Index (DI). Results: The cases were grouped according to histological grading. Mean DIs was calculated for each grade (1,2 and 3) to be 0.56, 0.61, and 0.68 respectively with a maximum standard error of 0.02. The DI spread within each grade was less than that across the three grades, thus validating this index as a viable grading indicator within the context of this study. Conclusion: We believe the new Digistain approach provides for the first time a cost effective and quantitative measure of tumour grade. This can be developed to deliver an effective assessment of prognosis and recurrence risk beyond traditional qualitative measures based on H&E staining protocols.",

However, reported levels of discordance vary significantly. Discordance might be true i.e. biological or a result of either analytical issues or morphologic discrepancies. Aim of the study was to estimate the incidence of true HER2 discordance between primary tumour (PT) and metastasis. Method: Institutional database was searched for metastatic breast carcinoma patients with HER2 assessed on both PT and metastasis. HER2 status in PT and metastasis was compared. In cases with discordant results HER2 and morphology were reviewed.",

Upon revision only 3 (1,4 %) cases were true discordant. In remaining cases discordance was due to discrepant morphology (n = 4; 1, 9 %) , false positive IHC results on either PT or metastasis (n = 4; 1, 9 %) , borderline results in both samples (n = 1; 0,5 %) and heterogeneous HER2 in PT while negative in metastasis (n = 1; 0,5 %). Conclusion: HER2 status is highly conserved in metastasis. As majority of discordant results is associated with analytical issues or morphologic discrepancies we suggest that in all discordant cases both HER2 and morphology are reviewed in both PT and metastasis.",

Kulka Objective: Cancer cells with stem-like properties have dysregulated selfrenewal properties, the ability to develop metastases, an aggressive behavior and chemotherapy resistance. The present study is aimed to evaluate stem-associated gene expression in primary breast cancer (BC) and in the homogenized Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) previously analyzed by biomolecular OSNA protocol, to verify their role as prognostic and predictive of response markers. Method: Of 177 patients operated between October 2010 and June 2011, 56 ones (42 infiltrating NST and 14 infiltrating lobular carcinomas) with operable CK19 positive BC and clinically negative evaluation of the axilla were studied. The expression of CD44, SOX2, SOX9 was determined by immunohistochemistry; the gene expression of SOX2 and POU5F1 was determined by RT-PCR in the homogenized SLNs obtained as residuum of the samples analyzed by OSNA technique and stored at \u221280\u00b0C (41 SLN positive, SLNpos, and 15 SLN negative, SLNneg). Results: SOX2 was expressed in 13 out of 41 primary BC from SLN positive cases and was associated with highly proliferative index (Ki67\u226520, p = 0.044), with further metastatic axillary lymph nodes (p = 0.008) and showed a trend with higher tumour stages. Furthermore, SOX2 was highly expressed in 3 out of 41 SLNpos and in any of 15 SLNneg. POU5F1 was not detected neither in SLNpos nor in SLNneg. CD44 and SOX9 preliminary immunohistochemical results were uneffective for correlation analyses. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that SOX2 identifies aggressive axillary positive BC. Homogenized from SLNs, used for OSNA analysis, might represent a clinical resource to identify cancer specific genes of prognostic value.",

Ponti, M. Tomatis, D. Casella, P. Armaroli, A. Sapino immunoreactive cells of 56 %. The 52 nonfunctioning ACTH-secreting neoplasms (6 TLs, 41 TCs, and 5 ACs) showed a mean percentage of ACTH positive cells of 12 %. Patients with functioning carcinoids were more frequently male (54 versus 27 %) and younger (mean age of 39 versus 61 years) than patients with nonfunctioning neoplasms. No different survival was observed between the two tumour categories. The mean diameters were 1.2 and 2.2 cm for functioning and nonfunctioning neoplasms, respectively. The mean mitotic counts x 10HPF were 1.43 and 0.88 and the mean Ki67 indices were 4.7 and 2 % for functioning and nonfunctioning neoplasms, respectively. Conclusion: ACTH expression in lung carcinoids is not rare and is not always associated with the presence of CS. Patients with CS are more frequently males and younger, with smaller tumours. The survival between functioning and nonfunctioning ACTH-producing carcinoids was not statistically different. Objective: C-Met is a membrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. Overexpression and activation lead to tumour cell migration and increased metastatic capability. It has been described as resistance mechanism in sunitinib treated RIP-Tag2 mice via hypoxia-related regulation mechanisms. Method: We used a TMA comprising 173 primary human pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNEN) to assess the clinicopathological role of c-Met expression and its relation to tumour hypoxia. Immunohistochemical stainings for c-Met, Hif-1\u03b1, CA9, GLUT1 and CD34 were correlated with established prognostic markers and outcome. C-Met and phospho-Met levels in BON1 and QGP-1 cell lines were measured by Western blot under hypoxic conditions with and without sunitinib treatment. Results: 38 of 173 pNEN showed immunohistochemical staining for c-Met. C-Met expression correlated with Hif-1\u03b1 (p = 0.031), MVD (p = 0.023), prognostic markers, relapse (p = 0.018) and survival (p = 0.008). No correlation was found with CA9 (p = 0.072) and GLUT1 (p = 0.859). Short term upregulation under hypoxic conditions was found in BON-1. Hypoxia and sunitinib treatment had no effect on phospho-Met levels in these cell lines. Conclusion: C-Met is expressed in a subgroup of pNEN and correlates with single hypoxia markers, prognostic markers and adverse outcome. Nonetheless, a mechanistic link between c-Met expression and activation by hypoxia or sunitinib treatment could not be detected in cell lines.",

F\u00e9lix Method: Thirteen cases of previously characterized uterine NECs (1999 NECs ( to 2015 were reviewed. HDAC 1, 2 and 6 and PAX5 immunohistochemistry was performed in a tissue microarray. Results: Twenty-two samples, comprising cervical (n = 5) and endometrial NECs (n = 7), metastases (n = 7) and non-NE components of mixed carcinomas (n = 3) were analyzed. All samples were PAX5 negative. HDAC 1 and 6 were positive in all cases. HDAC 2 was positive in all but one endometrial NEC. Conclusion: Negative PAX5 staining can be useful in the assessment of NEC origin as it is usually expressed in NECs of other organs. HDAC expression suggests the potential usefulness of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of uterine NEC. Translational studies should clarify whether this expression is predictive of response to treatment. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the immunohistochemical expression levels of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2A (SSTR 2A) in patients with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) and to investigate their association with clinicopathological parameters, specific type, grade, Ki67 expression, and disease outcome. Method: Expression of SSTR2A (clones UMB-1) was retrospectively studied by immunohistochemical analysis in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded gastric NEN surgical specimens from 39 patients and correlated with the clinicopathological features, and outcome. Results: High levels SSTR2A expression were observed in 53.8 % of gastric NENs (21/39) with strong membrane staining.The positive tumour cell population ranged from 15 to 90 %. The SSTR2A score was 2/3 in 64.3 % (9/14) of G1 NETs, 53.3 % (8/15) of G2 NETs, and 40.0 % (4/10) of NECs. The decreased levels of SSTR2A in gastric NENs were significantly correlated to the deep local invasion (p = 0.033), median tumour size (0.0048) and high rates of Ki67 index (0.027). SSTR2A score was not associated significantly with desease outcomes. Conclusion: The current analysis of clinicopathologic factors in patients with gastric NENs confirms the relationship of high SSTR2A expression with reduced NET aggressiveness and provides the basis for its further study as a predictive marker for somatostatin analog therapy in a group of receptor-positive NECs.",

The former lesion is confined to the bronchial/bronchiolar epithelium while in tumourlets, the cells have broken through the basal membrane. Three cases of DIPNECH and tumourlets associated with typical peripheral carcinoid tumour, without underlying lung disease, illustrate this spectrum. Method: Three female patients 60, 72 and 84 years old had CT-scans showing well-defined pulmonary nodule, respectively with 2.2, 1.6 and 1.4 cm. Two patients underwent surgical biopsy and one, lobectomy. Results: Macroscopic examination showed whitish or brownish lobulated tumours, corresponding to well differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms with less than 2 mitosis/2mm2 and without necrosis; diffuse staining for CD56, chromogranin A and CK7 was demonstrated with Ki-67 positivity under 4 %. In the remaining tissue, bronchial wall neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and several nodules with less than 5 mm, with identical morphological and immunohistochemistry features, were observed. Remnant pulmonary parenchime had preserved morphology. The patients are well and in clinical follow-up. Conclusion: The diagnosis of the spectrum of typical carcinoid associated with DIPNECH and tumourlets in the lung without other subjacent disease has only been demonstrated rarely, and these cases illustrate the peripheral neuroendocrine cells potentiality.",

Method: This study consisted of 16 patients with MCA. Genomic DNA was isolated from tumour samples and a targeted next generation sequencing assay was performed to detect mutations, copy number variations and structural variants by surveying exonic DNA sequences of 300 cancer genes and 113 introns across 35 genes. Results: 81.2 % of MCA (13/16) had either a KRAS (12) or NRAS mutation (1). Mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A, ARID1B, or SMARCA4) were present in 62.5 % of cases. Only one case harbored a mutation in TP53. Conclusion: Unlike cervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas, which harbor KRAS/NRAS mutations in 7 and 25 % of cases respectively, this is the most common molecular aberration detected in MCA (81.2 % of patients). Targeted inhibitors of the RAS/MAPK pathway may be useful in treatment of MCA. MCA are also characterized by frequent mutations in chromatin remodeling genes while TP53 mutations are uncommon.",

Results: The clinicopathological profile and the immunohistochemical results are shown in Table 1 . Conclusion: SMBTs are predominantly diagnosed as low stage disease and associated with a benign course. Mucin expression is very close to the normal mucin profile of endocervical glands, and neither the mucins nor the transcription factors associated with intestinal differentiation were found in this tumour type. A. F\u00e9lix Objective: Overexpression and aberrant glycosylation of mucins are frequent traits of human cancers derived from epithelial cells. The aim of this research was to investigate the significance of secretory mucins MUC2 and MUC6 in urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). Method: We investigated the relationship between mucin expression and clinicopathological characteristics in 539 cases of UBC. Immu\u00acnohistochemical analysis of MUC2 and MUC6 expression was performed on tissue microarrays containing representative cancer tissue samples. Results: MUC2 expression was observed in 40.1 %, while MUC6 stained 21.9 % of the tumours. The expression of MUC2 and MUC6 was associated with low tumour grade (P < 0.000 and P < 0.022, respectively), and low pathologic stage (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). MUC2 and MUC6 showed inverse correlation to cancer-specific death (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that expression of MUC2 and MUC6 in UBC was significantly associated with better overall survival of the patients (P < 0.001, respectively). In Cox regression model, the absence of MUC6 expression emerged as independent predictor of death outcome. Objective: The features of cytologic preparations of hereditary leiomyomatosis-renal cell carcinoma-associated renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) have not been reported, while contemporary protocols increasingly sample RCC by biopsy and aspiration for diagnosis. Method: We retrospectively reviewed effusion cytologic findings of a confirmed HLRCC. Results: A 42 year old female presenting with outside diagnosis of pneumonia showed a persistent pleural effusion. On transfer, CT scan demonstrated effusion, pleural nodules, adrenal mass, and kidney mass. Thoracentesis yielded sanguinous, hypocellular fluid with scattered clusters, small papillae, and individual cells with high nucleocytoplasmic ratio and variably eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm. Some cells showed large vacuoles with lateral nuclear displacement. Nucleomegaly with prominent macronucleoli was more prominent in the cell block, while pap-stained liquid-based preparations showed perinucleolar clearing. HLRCC was subsequently established with next-gen sequencing showing biallelic loss of fumarate hydratase (FH) . Immunohistohemistry showed lack of FH expression and induction of aberrant succination (2SC). Conclusion: Effusion cytology of HLRCC recapitulates rudimentary aspects of its characteristic cytomorphologic nucleolar findings. These are similar to cytologic features described for collecting duct carcinoma, reinforcing the importance of additional workup to distinguish these entities.",

Two of these TP53 mutations were annotated as rare single nucleotide polymorphisms and the remaining 2 SCC were induced by non HPV16/18 genotypes (31/73 and 45 respectively). 28/68 SCCs were HPV-negative with TP53 mutations being present in 18 SCC (64 %; average age 63 years) while 10 SCC (36 %; average age 71 years) showed TP53 wild type. 32/ 100 cases were excluded from the study due to technical reasons. Immunohistochemical p53 staining correlated with presence of TP53 mutations. Statistical analysis showed correlation of TP53 mutation with early onset of SCC and with decreased survival (37 versus 48 months), but no differences in tumour stage at diagnosis or tumour-related deaths in this heterogenously treated patient group.

Loss of p40 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition shift, resulting in N-cadherin and \u00dfcatenin formation induced via ERK-signaling and may be the basis of the aggressivity in these tumours. Conclusion: The loss of p40 in urothelia is correlated to dedifferentiation and invasivity of urothelial carcinoma. In contrast to p53, being reactiveand-stress induced, the loss of the constitutively expressed p40 (Delta-Np63) is a consistent marker of agressivity (and bad prognosis) in urothelial carcinomas.",

            "text": "Objective: Translocation Renal Cell Carcinoma (tRCC) is a rare and recently highlighted entity. Gene rearrangement involves TFE3 with 5 different described partners. Some authors suggest a prognostic role of the partner. Our goal was first to highlight fusion partners in a molecularly confirmed series of tRCC, second to compare efficiency of morphology, immunohistochemistry and FISH as diagnostic tools, finally to determine whether the rearrangement partner could play a prognostic role. Method: 23 cases were retrieved from Lille University Pathology Department. For 13 cases cryopreserved material was used for molecular study by RNA Sequencing. Immunohistochemistry with TFE3 antibody and FISH assay were studied for all the cases. Results: 20 cases displayed a TFE3 and one a TFEB rearrangement. Fusions partners were found for 11 cases highlighting 2 new partners: MED 15 and GRIPAP1. Fusion partner was not proved to be correlated with prognosis but lymph node involvement was associated with a pejorative evolution. Conclusion: Fusion transcripts can be varied in Xp11.2 tRCC. RNASequencing can help in highlighting new transcripts but FISH is efficient to confirm diagnosis. Prognosis seems to be linked to lymph involvement rather than to the fusion partner. Objective: The goal the present study is to determine an immunohistochemical profil of Olfactory Neuroblastoma that would give more objective and reproducible elements than pure morphology in their grading. Method: 35 patients were included. All slides were reevaluated with determination of Hyams grade. The most representative bloc was selected for an immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies against S100 protein, CKAE1/AE3, vimentin, la E-cadherin, P53, Ki67, VEGF, HER2, EGFR and CD34. Results: The most interesting morphological criteria were necrosis and mitotic count. Ki67 evaluation was well correlated to the mitotic count. P53 protein overexpression was not significantly associated with a pejorative evolution but a tendency was found. Most aggressive cases displayed a loss of E-Cadherin expression. Mean vascular density was not associated to the grade, the evolution or to VEGF expression. Conclusion: Grading most effective morphological criteria are necrosis and mitotic count. Evaluation of Ki67 and loss of expression of E-Cadherin could be useful to determine a new grading system. A molecular analysis will maybe draw a more objective line between low and high grade tumours.",

Due to its risks as irritant and carcinogen, occupational hazards units recommend exposure reduction or elimination. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of alternative fixatives. Method: Three contiguous fragments from 20 specimens were fixed for the same length of time using three different fixatives: formaldehyde, Glyo-Fixx, and FineFIX. Sixty containers were identified with a number (from 1 to 20) and the letters A, B, or C (which identified the fixative). The choice of fixative was decided by using a die (1 or 6, formaldehyde; 2 or 5, Glyo-Fixx; 3 or 4, FineFIX). All samples were stained and processed using the same methodology. The results were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Results: Twenty pathologists evaluated both morphology preservation and staining quality. Upon comparison of the three fixatives in relation to the various stainings, formaldehyde proved to be the best by showing statistically significant superior results. The differences between GLYO-Fixx and FineFIX were not significant. Conclusion: Formaldehyde provides the best results in regard to both staining quality and morphology preservation. Alternative fixatives do not achieve the same quality standards. Therefore, formaldehyde fixation seems to be a reasonable risk to assume. Monday, 7 September 2015, 17.00-19. Objective: To study the expression of p16INK4a in a series of HPVnegative laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas and its prognostic value. Method: Forty-five patients with laryngeal carcinoma were included in the study. Clinicopathological features and prognosis were reviewed. p16INK4a protein expression was analyzed through immunohistochemistry. mRNA was analyzed in 25 cases through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. HPV negativity was assessed by PCR using three different protocols based on MY09/11 and GP5/6 primers. Results: Four out of 45 (9 %) cases overexpressed p16INK4a protein and showed a tendency to worse survival that was significant for stages I-III (log-rank p-value = 0.001). p16INK4a mRNA expression was 0.7 \u00b1 0.42 (mean \u00b1 SD) and 12 out of 25 (48 %) had mRNA overexpression with an arbitrary cut off at 0.5. All tumours were HPV-negative with all three detection methods. The results were correlated to CDKN2A mutations. Two cases positive for p16INK4a immunostaining harbored CDKN2A mutations (one missense and one frameshift). Six out of seven (86 %) mutated cases presented p16INK4a mRNA overexpression whereas it was found only in 6 out of 18 (33 %) non mutated cases (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that p16INK4a overexpression, both at protein and mRNA levels may reflect CDKN2A genetic alterations in HPV-negative laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas.",

Method: A 56 years old male patient underwent left sided parotidectomy because of a salivary duct carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. Postoperative CT staging after 3 and 6 months was negative. After 1 year the patient presented with a pulmonary infiltration in the right lower lobe by non small cell lung cancer, favor adenocarcinoma. Reflex-testing for EGFR mutation and ALK-rearrangement as routine diagnostic workup of the pulmonary adenocarcinoma was performed, immunohistochemical markers in both tumours compared. Results: Two carcinomas of the patient were detected consecutively after 16 months. Metastases of the primary salivary duct carcinoma had been found in ipsilateral left cervical lymph-nodes. After 14 months a PET/CT showed a segmental infiltration in the right lower lobe of the lung and enlarged lymphnodes bilaterally in the mediastinum and right sided cervical. Both carcinomas had cytological and histological similarities, the infiltration in the endobronchial biopsy was partly lymphangitic, without clear correlation to the surface epithelium, there were dysplastic changes in the bronchial glands. After detection of ALK rearrangement in the lung adenocarcinoma, comparative ALK immunohistochemistry, was positive in both tumours, ALK rearrangement by FISH was seen in a similar quantity of 50 and 40 % of tumour cells respectively in lung and salivary gland. Conclusion: ALK rearrangement in salivary duct carcinomas could be a targetable somatic alteration in comparison to TTF1 negative ALK positive lung cancer. Objective: Accurate screening of HR-HPVoropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a critical issue. Recently, a novel RNA in situ hybridisation test (the RNAscope HPV-test\u00ae) has been developed to detect HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA in Formalin fixed tissue. The aim of this study is to validate this assay against the \"gold standard\", namely the quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) for HR-HPV16-18, performed on fresh frozen (FF) tissue. Method: 50 Formalin fixed samples of OPSCC were tested with RNAscope HPV-test\u00ae, p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Chromogenic In Situ-Hybridisation (CISH) for HPV-DNA. The results were compared with those of qRT-PCR on matched FF samples. Results: Against qRT-PCR test, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPP) of the RNAscope HPV-test\u00ae and of p16-IHC were 93, 94, 96, 88 and 96, 93, 96 and 93 %, respectively. Six cases were discrepant between the qRT-PCR test and CISH. Conclusion: The RNAscope HPV-test\u00ae is very performant and easier to interpret than CISH. P16 performance is also very good, but it is only an indirect marker of the presence of HPV16. This study suggests that the RNAscope HPV-test\u00ae is a promising test that could be developed as a \"clinical standard\" for precise identification of HPV-related OPSCC. Objective: Hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma (HCCC) was first described in 1994. It is considered a diagnosis of exclusion by the World Health Organization (WHO). EWSR1-ATF1 fusion has been consistently found in HCCC and similar rearrangements are present in 63 % of clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (CCOC). Method: We report two cases: one of HCCC (case 1) and one of CCOC (case 2). Case1: a 51-year old female with a palatal mass with local recurrence after 10 years. Case2: a 61-year old male with a mass of the maxilla that had several recurrences within 6 years of follow-up. Results: Histologically, both cases were composed of an admixture of clear and eosinophilic cells, with rare mitotic figures, that connected to the surface epithelium. In case 2 the cells at the periphery of the nests occasionally demonstrated nuclear palisading. Immunoprofile: Cytokeratin +, p63 +, myoepithelial markers -. Examination by FISH for the EWSR1 rearrangement was positive in case 1 and negative in case 2. Conclusion: Molecular pathology offers new insights in the distinction of clear cell tumours. HCCC is a translocation-driven tumour that can no longer be considered a diagnosis of exclusion. CCOC probably represents a central variant of HCCC.",

Despite the remaining controversies regarding terminology, NE-HN may be divided into two groups owning to its epithelial differentiation, comprising small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC), typical and atypical carcinoid, or neural features as paragangliomas. Moreover, there is adenoma of the middle ear (AME), a benign neoplasm with variable mixed endocrine and exocrine differentiation. We aim to review NE-HN in our department and present two illustrative cases of the diagnostic challenges. Method: We reviewed all NE-HN with epithelial differentiation from the Department of Pathology archive of IPO-Porto (2005 -2015 . Relevant clinicopathological information was collected from clinical files and pathology reports. We also selected two paradigmatic cases, 1AME and 1SCNC of the nasopharynx (Figure1). Results: Five SCNC and one AME were identified. SCNC group: age (median, range): 59 (45-80), 3 (60 %) male, treated with surgery (n = 1, 20 %), chemotherapy (n = 1,20 %), chemotherapy+radiotherapy (n = 2, 40 %) and surgery+radiotherapy (n = 1,20 %); four (80 %) dead of disease. AME was treated only by surgery, without evidence of recurrence. Clinicopathological features summarized in Fig.1 . Conclusion: NE-HN are rare and there are diverse treatment options. An accurate NE-HN diagnosis and classification is essential to treatment planning. Further studies are warranted to uncover prognostic factors and to define optimal treatment. Objective: The local recurrence rate in oral squamous cell cancer (OSCC) hardly decreases. This is partly due to the presence of (pre)malignant cells in remaining tissue after resection, that may lead to development of a new tumour in time. Because histolopathological identification of (pre)malignant cells in tumour resection margins may be difficult in routine practice, we examined if detection of chromosomal instability (CIN) by FISH in histopathologically tumour-free margins could predict recurrence. Method: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 40 OSCC, 233 resection margins, and 11 recurrences of 40 patients (radically resected primary tumour, treated between 1994 and 2003 with curative intent without postoperative treatment, \u2265 5 years-follow-up) were subjected to FISH to examine chromosome 1 and 7 copy number variations, and to p53 immunohistochemistry. Results were statistically correlated with each other and clinical data. Results: 11 out of 40 patients developed local recurrence within 5 years. FISH analysis showed that nine of 11 OSCC that recurred exhibited in at least one resection margin CIN (p 0.018), defined as imbalances and/or polyploidization for chromosomes 1 and 7. P53 overexpression and WHO classification did not correlate with recurrent disease. Conclusion: CIN in OSCC resection margins can reliably identify patients at risk for developing a local recurrence. Objective: To evaluate keratin 5 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with emphasis to EGFR expression and TNM staging parameters. Method: K5 and EGFR were immunohistochemically highlighted for 42 cases of HNSCC (25 cases of laryngeal SCC and 17 cases of pharyngeal SCC). K5 and EGFR microscopic evaluation was completed with a statistic analysis between their expression, tumour grade and TNM staging parameters. Results: HNSCC evaluation showed K5 positivity for 59.5 % of total cases and EGFR expression in 85.7 % of cases. Coexpression of K5/EGFR characterized 59.5 % of total cases (p = 0.05) and their assessement based on origin, showed that 60 % of laryngeal SCC had K5+/EGFR+ tumour cells while only 40 % of pharyngeal SCC were positive for both markers. K5 expression was correlated with T parameter (p = 0.009) and the same significant correlation was found between tumour grade and EGFR. For laryngeal SCC a significant correlation was observed between EGFR expression in tumour cells and vascular invasion (p = 0.05). Pharyngeal SCC showed K5 expression correlated with vascular invasion (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Our data suggest the existence of a K5+/EGFR+ cell subpopulation with a high invasiveness potential.",

Immunostains were performed for CKs, AR, vimentin, p63, ASMA, CK14, p53, INI1, Results: Eight cases of SDCRF (0.4 %) were selected. Seven cases were male with a mean of 62 years (range: 36-85 years), which included six parotid gland cases and two submandibular gland cases. Three cases are alive with disease, whereas other four cases are dead. Histologically, six of eight cases showed carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. The carcinoma components showed diffuse proliferation of non-coherent large ovoid atypical cells showing eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. Immunohistochemically, such cells were positive for pan-CK, GCDFP-15, AR and INI1 in all cases, whereas they were negative for vimentin. Seven cases showed Her-2 overexpression. Such rhabdoid cells were negative for myoepithelial markers. Decreased or no expression of Ecadherin was seen in seven cases. Carcinoma cells showed high labeling index of Ki-67. Finally, we diagnosed these cases to be \"SDCRF\". Conclusion: SDCRF is an extremely rare subtype of SDC, and such a subtype indicates an aggressive clinical behavior. The morphogenesis of \"the rhabdoid cells\" in SDCRF is related to down-regulation of E-cadherin. Objective: Case presentation: A 37 year old male, non smoking farmer presented with a 4 month history of feeling unwell with lethargy, chills, night sweats and loss of appetite. Method: Physical examination and peripheral blood profile were normal. Autoantibody screen, serology for viral, fungal and bacterial pathogens and Mantoux skin test were negative. CT thorax showed complex consolidation of the left upper lobe with associated emphysema. The other lobes appeared normal. Bronchoscopy was unremarkable. Cultures for AFB, TB and Fungi were negative. Results: Post multidisciplinary team meeting he proceeded to upper lobectomy. Replacement of the upper lobe of lung by a spongy, haemorrhagic encapsulated lesion was seen. Histology showed bullous emphysematous change with immature placental structures. Epithelium expressed TTF-1, CK,AE/AE3. The stromal component was negative for TTF-1. A diagnosis of placental pulmonary placental transmogrification was made. Conclusion: Pulmonary placental transmogrification is rare, first described by Chesney in 1978. It presents as a cystic, locally destructive lesion in the young or middle-aged. It is thought to be a reactive lesion secondary to emphysema. The clinical presentations range from an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient to severe respiratory symptoms. Objective: Explore possibilities of postmortem MRI for evaluation of the severity of the maceration and time of fetal death. Method: At postmortem MRI bodies of 8 fetuses (gestational age: 18-21 weeks) and 18 stillbirths (15 antenatal, 3 intranatal, gestational age 22-40 weeks) was calculated MR maceration indicator of the brain, liver, kidney, lung, and thigh muscle. At autopsy, were evaluated macroscopic (area of desquamation, edema of the subcutaneous tissue, the mobility of the joints and bones) and histological (disappearance of basophilia of the nuclei of cells of the internal organs) signs and the time of death. Results: Based on the results of morphological research of stillbirths degree of maceration (0) (1) (2) (3) (4) . Prescription of death coming ranged from 0 h to 14 days in cases of antenatal death. Correlation analysis showed a direct positive correlation of MR-maceration indicator and data of autopsy: for lung tissue (r = 0,99, p = 0,004), femoral muscles (r = 0,95, p = 0,003), brain (r = 0,94, p = 0,015). Conclusion: At fetal death the degree of maceration is characterized by changes of the T1WI and T2WI signal during postmortem MRI. Definition of MR maceration indicator with a high degree credibility allows us to estimate the severity of the time of occurrence of fetal death.",

Stanek * * Children's Hospital Cincinnati, Dept. of Pathology, USA Objective: To assess the usefulness and limitations of placental villous associations of clinical umbilical cord (UC) compromise and morphological UC abnormalities. Method: 5634 consecutive placentas divided into four groups were statistically compared: Group 1: 182 cases from pregnancies with clinical features of UC compromise (variable decelerations, UC entanglement, prolapse or true knot at delivery); Group 2: 1355 placentas with morphological UC abnormalities (UC itself or its abnormal insertion); Group 3: 152 cases with at least one phenotype from Group 1 and one from Group 2, Group 4: 3945 cases with no umbilical cord-related phenotypes. Frequencies of phenotypes were analyzed by ANOVA or \u03c72 with 3 df with 0.0007353 Bonferroni adjustment for 68 clinical and placental phenotypes analyzed. Results: 30 phenotypes featured statistically significant differences: 13 clinical and 17 placental. 2 clinical phenotypes (oligohydramnios and abnormal fetal heart rate tracing) were most common in Group 1, 6 in Group 2: 4 clinical (abnormal umbilical artery Dopplers, nonmacerated stillbirth, multiple pregnancy, fetal growth restriction) and 2 placental, and 22 in Group 3: 7 clinical (gestational hypertension, polyhydramnios, induction of labor, cesarean section, macerated stillbirth, congenital malformations, abnormal 3rd stage of labor), and the remaining placental ( Figure) . Conclusion: Clinical signs of UC compromise were associated with no pathomorphological placental abnormalities, while the coexistence of clinical and abnormal morphological placental phenotypes was statistically significantly associated with placental histological signs of decreased fetal blood flow, hypoxia (acute and chronic postuterine), shallow placental implantation, and/or amnion nodosum. One should not expect confirmation of clinical umbilical cord compromise on placental examination if no morphological abnormalities of the umbilical cord itself or its abnormal implantation have been found.",

Stanek * * Children's Hospital Cincinnati, Dept. of Pathology, USA Objective: To assess the usefulness and limitations of placental examination in evaluation of stillbirth. Method: Placentas from 520 consecutive stillbirths were extracted from the clinicoplacental database of several thousand placentas from high risk pregnancies. Frequencies of clinical and placental phenotypes were analyzed by ANOVA or Chi-square where appropriate, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results: With subclassifications according to gestational age and fetal maceration status, statistically significant differences in abnormal clinical and placental phenotypes are presented in Figure which shows that placental diagnosis in stillbirth is gestational age-and fetal maceration-dependent. Notably absent are lack of differences in frequencies of hypertensive diseases of pregnancy by either subclassification. Abnormal placental phenotypes are more common than clinical phenotypes. Conclusion: The cause of non-macerated stillbirth is frequently ascending infection, typically complicated by placental abruption, particularly in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. This is also true of second trimester stillbirth, independently of maceration status. Even in totally fibrotic placenta of macerated stillbirth, villous hemosiderosis in lobular distribution highlighted with Prussian blue stain is diagnostic of fetal thrombotic vasculopathy. In preterm 3rd trimester, the most common cause of fetal demise is uteroplacental insufficiency, characteristically with malperfusion histotopathology. At term, the cause of stillbirth is usually either placental dysmaturity or acute in-utero hypoxia. However, many cases of stillbirth are of still unknown cause either clinical or placental. Objective: Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM/CD56) and \u03b2-catenin are required for self-renewal and differentiation of nephron progenitors (NPs), during mesenchymal-epithelial transformation (MET) stages in kidney development. In embryogenesis differential expression of cadherins (CDHs), calcium-dependent adhesion molecules, runs morphogenesis by stimulating cell aggregation, placing boundaries between groups of cells and promoting cell migration. Thus, expression of several different CDHs in relation to NCAM+/\u03b2-catenin+ NPs was investigated. Method: Double immunofluorescent labeling was performed on cryostat human fetal samples from 15th till 36th week of gestation. Five different CDHs antibodies: CDH1, CDH2, CDH6, CDH11 and CDH16, as well as NCAM and \u03b2-catenin were analyzed. Results: CDH11 expression was found only at pre-MET stage (uninduced and condensed mesenchyme) on NCAM+/\u03b2-catenin+ NPs. Nevertheless, NCAM+/\u03b2-catenin+ NPs in post-MET stage (renal vesicle, comma and S-shaped body) showed expression of CDH1, CDH6 and CDH16. Interestingly, during MET, at pre-tubular aggregate stage, NCAM+/\u03b2-catenin+ NPs expressed exclusively CDH6, while CDH2 was detected only on S-shaped body. Conclusion: Our data indicated that CDH6 is required for early aggregation of condensed cells, while CDH2 is necessary for further elongation of newly formed epithelium. Specific CDHs expressions at each stage of MET illustrates capacity of NCAM+/\u03b2-catenin+ NPs to undertake cadherin switching, potential driving force of nephrogenesis.",

Method: For the purpose of the study a histopathological diagnosis of IH was performed in 57 paraffin-embedded blocks. A total of 27 patients were treated with propranolol. The remaining 30 constituted the control group. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase3 was determined by immunohistochemistry by means of a panel of monoclonal antibodies and peroxidase detection system. In each case, 1000 cells were evaluated in the vascular endothelial tissue. The expression of cell nucleus was assumed to be positive upon brown discoloration in a clinical study of Bax and brown cytoplasmic staining in Bcl-2 and Caspase3. Immunochemical interpretation and method were also used to analyze the control group. Nikon optical microscope and computer image analysis system (Multi Base v 808 Computer Scanning System) were applied in the study. In cases of controversy concerning the results, mean results were recorded and consulted with an experienced pathologist. Results: The number of positive cells in Caspase3 showed a significant increase in the treatment group in comparison with the control (P < 0.05). This outcome confirms the assumed hypothesis. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax did not differ significantly across the group of treated versus untreated children. The calculations were performed by means of Statistica v10.0 software. Conclusion: The application of propranolol seems to be a factor that has an impact on the apoptosis process in the treatment of Infantile Haemangioma.",

In the classification by Stocker of CPAM, five types were described. Herein, we report a CPAM Type 4 in a symptomatic 1-month-old child. Method: The baby presented to hospital with dyspnea, cough and poor feeding. During examination, diminished breath sounds were detected at right hemithorax. Radiologically, the chest radiograph and the high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) revealed solid mass, 4 \u00d7 3 cm in diameter with cystic component in the posterior segment of right lower lobe. The patient underwent surgery. Results: Microscopically, the lesion consisted of a multicystic spaces which had relatively thin and uniform connective tissue walls lined by type 2 alveolar lining cells positive with TTF-1. Other parts of the lesion was composed of thin alveolar wall-like structures. The differential diagnosis was made from pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) by confirming the absence of a cambian layer of rhabdomyosarcoma in the wall of the cysts along with negative staining for desmin and the patient diagnosed as CPAM Type 4. Conclusion: CPAM Type 4 is the acinar malformation lesion that consists of varying sized cysts; all lined by type 1 and 2 alveolar lining cells in benign fashion. Due to the similarity in microscopy, distinguishing the Type 4 lesion from (PPB) is critical for treatment modalities.",

Middle cerebral and uterine arteries, umbilical vein blood flow and Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) in maternal blood were evaluated. Placental lesions were classified according to Redline's as placental underperfusion (PUP) maternal or fetal, or inflammation. Perinatal morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months were evaluated. Results: Placentas were smaller and had more lesions reflecting PUP in the SGA group. Among LOSGA babies, those with PUP had higher perinatal morbidity, more alterations in prenatal ultrasound parameters (high uterine and low middle cerebral arteries pulsatility indexes and low umbilical vein blood flow normalized for expected fetal weight) and lower PlGF. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were also significantly poorer. Conclusion: LOSGA babies without Doppler evidence of placental insufficiency have PUP changes that can be prenatally predicted by a combination of parameters. These infants are at greater risk of perinatal morbidity and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

Method: We evaluated right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies of two consecutive years (2011) (2012) taken from 82 patients with MCS prior to heart transplantation (MCS group) and 138 patients without MCS (non-MCS group). The MCS group was subdivided (HeartMate II, HeartWare, Novacor, Incor I, Excor). Conventional histology and immunohistochemistry (C4d) were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Results: While there was a significant difference in C4d deposition between the MCS group (n = 82) and the non-MCS group (p = 0.021, odds ratio = 0.524), the Excor patients (39/82) did not show an increase in C4d depositions (p = 0.838, odds ratio = 1.11). Patients with the remaining MCS types (43/82) showed signs of AMR in more cases than the non-MCS group (p = 0.003, odds ratio = 2.97).

The innate immune system, in particular macrophages, plays an important role in the resorptive process of ACR and is known to promote IF. We analyzed the effect of ACR and the level of macrophages on the degree of IF in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) of cardiac allografts. Method: During two consecutive years (2011-2012) we investigated EMBs from 254 patients [mean age 37 years, mean time after heart transplantation (HTx) 8.9 years]. Tissue sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded EMBs were evaluated histologically using immunohistochemical stains (CD3, CD68). The amount of macrophages was assessed by eyeballing. The EMBs were evaluated for level of IF on a Sirius red stain and further quantified using NIKON software (NIS elements AR 4.10.02). Statistical analysis was done in R using Fisher's exact tests, bootstrapped Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, GLM methods and tree analysis. Results: The density of macrophages correlated with ACR (p = 0.000) and with both pure IF (p = 0.017) and overall IF (p = 0.001). Interestingly, ACR appeared to have no direct impact on pure or overall IF (p = 0.749, p = 0.760). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the density of macrophages is an important predictive factor for the remodeling in cardiac allografts.",

            "text": "Next generation sequencing is highly sensitive for the detection of beta-catenin mutations in desmoid-type fibromatoses Objective: Desmoid-type fibromatoses (DTFs) are locally aggressive and frequently recurrent tumours, the majority of which harbor beta-catenin (CTNNB1) mutations; accurate diagnosis is essential for patient management. We used next generation sequencing (NGS) to detect CTNNB1 mutations, and compared the sensitivity and specificity of NGS with our standard mutation detection technique: mutation-specific restriction enzyme digestion (MSRED). Tuesday, 8 September 2015, 14.30-16.30 , Meeting Room 6/I OFP-11 Joint Oral Free Paper Session Cardiovascular / Soft Tissue and Bone Pathology Method: DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded needle biopsy or resection tissue sections from sporadic DTFs (n = 144), syndrome-related DTFs (n = 4), and morphological mimics (n = 11). Two primer pairs were designed for CTNNB1 mutation hotspots. Using \u226510ng of DNA, libraries were generated by Fluidigm and sequenced on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. Results: NGS had a sensitivity of 92. 36 % (133/144, 95 % CIs: 86.74 to 96.12 %) and a specificity of 100 % for the detection of CTNNB1 mutations in DTF-like spindle cell lesions. All mutations detected by MSRED were identified by NGS. NGS identified additional mutations in 11 tumours that were not detected by MSRED, two of which have not been previously described. Conclusion: NGS is highly sensitive for the detection of CTNNB1 mutations. This multiplex assay has the advantage of detecting additional mutations compared to those detected by MSRED (sensitivity 82. 41 %) . The technology requires minimal DNA and is time-and cost-efficient. Objective: Chordomas and chondrosarcomas are malignant mesenchymal tumours with overlapping morphological and immunohistochemical (IHC) characteristics. Our objective was to compare the expression of \u03b1methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR / P504S), \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin in chordomas relative to chondrosarcomas by IHC stains. Method: Archival sections of 18 chordomas, 9 chondrosarcomas and 10 mature cartilage samples were immunostained and scored for AMACR \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin. The relative differential capacity of each marker was calculated from the scoring results. In addition, AMACR mRNA level was assessed in 5 chordomas by RT-PCR and evaluated by comparative CT method. Results were analyzed by the appropriate statistical methods. Results: AMACR and \u03b2-catenin stained 88.9 % of the chordomas, 22.2 and 11.1 % of chondrosarcomas respectively and none of the mature cartilage samples. E-cadherin stained positively 77.8 % of the chordomas, 77.8 % of the chondrosarcomas and 30 % of the mature cartilage cases. Both AMACR and \u03b2-catenin showed statistically significant difference between chordomas and chondrosarcomas (p < 0.01 for both), unlike Ecadherin. AMACR was detected at the mRNA level. Conclusion: AMACR is expressed in most of the chordomas but only in a minority of chondrosarcomas. AMACR may serve as IHC marker of chordoma with differentiating ability comparable to that of \u03b2-catenin.",

Method: Cases were identified by interrogating the departmental reporting software to identify all embolectomy specimens over the course of 5 years (31.12.2009 to 31.12.2014 ) using a SNOMED code search. A retrospective review of histology reports was then undertaken. Results: 118 cases were identified; mean age 68 years (23-96 years). The most common indication for embolectomy was acute limb ischaemia (48 %) and the most common site of embolism was the leg (73 %).

Method: Cases of SUDAM and SADS (using alcohol consumption history) in people aged 16-64 years old were identified from a database of cases referred to our cardiovascular tertiary referral centre since its inception (spanning approximately 40 years). A retrospective analysis of cases, including demographics and post-mortem results, was conducted. Results: 41 cases of SADS and 62 cases of SUDAM were identified. The SUDAM group were older at death than the SADS group (P = 0.0002). There was also higher incidence of significant psychiatric illness in SUDAM cases. Post mortem examination of the liver in the SUDAM groups was more likely to be enlarged (P = 0.0033) or demonstrate fatty change. Conclusion: Heavy alcohol use does not preclude the possibility of a heritable channelopathies. It may therefore be advisable to recommend genetic screening of relatives in cases thought to be SUDAM when the person who died was young or had a normal liver to avoid misattributing a case of SADS. Objective: During angiogenesis blood endothelial cells (BECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) express specific markers, which help their discrimination and easier identification. Since coronary thrombi material aspirated from ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients proved as good angiogenesis model, we investigated expression of CD34 and CD31 as BECs markers, and D2-40 as LECs marker in this material. Method: Aspirated thrombi were stained immunohistochemically for CD34, CD31 and D2-40. Immunopositive cells were organized as single, clusters or microvessels. Immunohistochemically positive material was stained with double immunofluorescence for CD31, CD34 and D2-40. Thrombi were also graded as fresh (<1 day old), lytic (1-5 days old) and organized (>5 days old). Results: Serial sections of aspirated thrombi showed concordant CD31, CD34 and D2-40 immunopositivity. Double immunoflorescence proved co-expression of CD34 and CD31, and CD31 and D2-40. Clusters and microvessels of D2-40+ cells were mainly present in lytic and organized thrombi. Conclusion: Co-expression of CD34, CD31 and D2-40 on the same nontumourous cell during thrombus neovascularization indicates existing in vivo plasticity of BECs and LECs. It also points that CD34 and CD31 on one hand, and D2-40 immunostaining on the other hand, cannot solely be a reliable indicator whether vessel is lymphatic or not.",

It was proposed to be related to Acute Cellular Rejection (ACR). The aim of this study was to assess the relation between QE prevalence and Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR). Method: 1350 EMBs from 212 patients who underwent heart transplantation in years 2001-2013 were initially diagnosed in The Department of Pathology, The Children's Memorial Health Institute, as AMR1 and AMR0, according to ISHLT 2004 criteria (based on C4d positive stain). Presence of QE with distinguishing subtypes A (without involvement of myocardium) and B (lymphocytic infiltrate bulging in the endocardium and infiltrating myocardium) were assessed. Results: 121 EMBs from 16 patients with AMR1 (group 1), and 1229 EMBs from 196 patients with AMR0 (group 2), were analised. QE type A was found in 16 (13,22 %) EMBs in group 1; in 96 (7,81 %) EMBs in group 2, p < 0.001. QE type B was diagnosed in 562 (42,97 %) EMBs in group 1; in 245 (19,93 %) EMBs in group 2, p < 0.001. QE was not present in 53 (43, 80 %) EMBs in group 1; in 888 (72,25 %) EMBs in group 2, p < 0.001. There was no difference in the frequency of each QE subtype between groups in AMR positive biopsies. Conclusion: The relation between Quilty effect prevalence and AMR is possible as QE is present statistically more often in EMBs with C4d positive stain.",

Results: A continuity between anterior and septal TV leaflets was found in 98 % of hearts (3.8 \u00b1 2.9 mm) and in 3 of the 4 cases with AVJ ablation, one of whom requiring a left side approach. Conduction system investigation revealed fibrosis of AV node and/or distal His bundle in all three with a right side approach and of branching bundle/proximal bundle branches in three cases. In the setting of a left side approach, fibrosis the ventricular septum crest was noted with intact compact AV node. Conclusion: Our data suggest a crucial role of the anatomic variability of antero-septal TV leaflets commissure on the efficacy of AVJ ablation. The continuity protects the AV node from ablation with a right side approach, as to require multiple shocks and a left approach.",

Paolin, G. Gerosa, G. Thiene, K. Pilichou * University of Padua, Dept. of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Medicine, Padova, Italy Objective: Dysregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway has been associated with mitral valve (MV) prolapse due to myxoid degeneration (floppy MV). The activation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway and its effect on differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) in myofibroblasts and on adherens junction (AJ) in MV prolapse are investigated. Method: Floppy MV leaflets were obtained from 30 patients (24M, mean age 55.5 \u00b1 12.7 year) underwent surgical repair. Ten age and sex-matched Homograft Tissue Bank samples served as controls. MV leaflet cellular and extracellular matrix composition was evaluated by histology and trasmission electron microscopy. Phosphorylated Smad2 (p-Smad2), \u03b1smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and junctional proteins in VICs were assessed by immuno-histochemistry and immunoblotting. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out for components of TGF-\u03b2 pathway cascade. Results: Floppy MV leaflets were thicker (p < 0.001) and had higher \u03b1-SMA+ cell density (p = 0.002) and collagen III (p < 0.001) than controls. Enhanced p-Smad2 nuclear immune-reactivity (p < 0.001) and TGF-\u03b21 gene (p = 0.045), TIMP1 (p = 0.020) and CTGF (p = 0.047) expression but no differences in FLN-A and total Smad2 gene expression levels were found between floppy MV and controls. Higher expression of cadherin-11, either exclusively or in colocalization with N-cadherin, and aberrant presence of plakophilin-2 at the AJ was found in floppy MV vs. controls. Conclusion: TGF-\u03b21 activation in MV prolapse induces VICs differentiation into contractile myofibroblasts and changes in the AJ, with increased cadherin-11 and aberrant plakophilin-2 expression. AJ reinforcement might promotes latent-TGF-\u03b21 activation eventually leading to extracellular matrix remodeling in floppy MV. Objective: Missense mutations of the GJA1 gene encoding the gap junction channel protein connexin43 (Cx43) cause bone malformations, while GJA1 mutant mice develop osteopenia. In this study we investigated Cx43 expression and channel functions in giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB), a locally aggressive osteolytic lesion with uncertain progression. Method: Cx43 protein levels were correlated with GCTB cell types, clinico-radiological stages and progression free survival in 89 primary and 34 recurrent GCTB cases. Subcellular localization of Cx43 and gap junction coupling was also tested in neoplastic GCTB stromal cells. Results: In GCTB tissues, Cx43 protein was mainly produced by neoplastic stromal cells. Significantly less Cx43 was detected in osteoclastrich tumour nests than in the adjacent reactive stroma. Progressively reduced Cx43 production in GCTB was significantly linked to advanced clinico-radiological stages and worse progression free survival. In GCTB stromal cell cultures most Cx43 protein was stuck in the paranuclear-Golgi region compared to fibroblast or bone marrow stromal cells without phosphorylation at Ser369, Ser372 or Ser373. Also, GCTB stromal cells transferred significantly less fluorescing calcein dye (622 Da) between them. Conclusion: Significant downregulation of Cx43 expression and gap junction coupling in neoplastic stromal cells are associated with the clinical progression and worse prognosis in GCTB. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the impact of rHuEPO on anemia, renal function and structure in chronic renal failure (CRF), using a rat model of nephrectomy. Method: Male Wistar rats, 12 weeks old, were divided in 3 groups: CRF (induced by a two-stage 5/6 nephrectomy); rHuEPO-CRF (treated with 100 IU/kg/week during 3 weeks) and Sham (surgery without mass reduction). Hematological and biochemical studies were performed. Kidney tissue sections were stained with Periodic acid-Schiff for histological studies. Statistical analysis were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Results: At the end of protocol, CRF group presented anemia (p < 0.05) and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), whereas rHuEPO-CRF group showed an improvement in hematological parameters (p < 0.05) and a slight improvement in GFR. The histopathological analysis of kidney tissue showed that CRF group presented global glomerulosclerosis, tubular necrosis, IFTA and arteriolosclerosis. Due to surgery, we also found some inflammatory cell infiltration. The rHuEPO-CRF group presented mesangial expansion and a reduction in tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions, as compared to CRF rats. Conclusion: The introduction of rHuEPO corrects the anemia associated with renal failure and improved the degree of renal lesions, slowing the progress of renal failure.",

We investigated if macrophage differentiation is associated with stage of lupus nephritis and clinical parameters. Method: 69 renal biopsies with lupus nephritis (ISN/RPS classes II-V) were assessed for M1(iNOS/CD68), M2a(CD206/CD68) and M2c(CD163/CD68). Blood pressure, proteinuria and serum urea were correlated using Spearman-test. Cluster analysis was used to define Lupus nephritis subtypes by macrophage activation markers. Results: The mean number of CD68+macrophages was related to ISN/RPS class with the highest macrophage infiltration in diffuse proliferative class IV and the lowest number in class V. In all ISN/RPS classes more CD163+/CD68+ M2c-like than CD206+/ CD68+ M2a-like cells were seen. We predominantly detected M2-macrophages independent of ISN/RPS classification. The majority of M2a-and M2c-macrophages were localized in the tubulointerstitium. Using data for macrophage activation markers, 3 different clusters were described. Interestingly, some beeing dominated by one ISN/RPS-class; e.g. >75 % of patients from cluster 1 were allocated to ISN/RPS class IV. Serum creatinine correlated positively with the number of CD68+ (r = 0.411; p < 0.002) and CD206+/CD68+ M2alike macrophages in the tubulointerstitium (r = 0.441; p = 0.001). The number of tubular CD163+/CD68+ M2c-like cells was related to serum urea (r = 0.611;p = 0.001). Mean number of CD206+/CD68+macrophages was sig. higher in hypertensive compared to normotensive patients (p < 0.007). Conclusion: M2-type macrophages are key players in lupus nephritis and macrophage subpopulations seem to be involved in the development of disease progressing hypertension.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chronic treatment with chaethomellic acid A (CA) on renal fibrosis associated to 5/6 nephrectomy. Method: Male Wistar rats were subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy (RMR) or sham-operated (SO). One week after surgery, rats were placed in four experimental groups: RMR: rats without treatment (n = 13); RMR+CA: rats treated with CA (n = 13); SO: rats without treatment (n = 13); SO+AC: rats treated with CA (n = 13). CA was intraperitoneally administered in a dose of 0.23 \u03bcg/Kg three times a week for 6 months. Renal samples were scored for the following lesions: glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, arteriolosclerosis and interstitial inflammation. Results: Animals from the SO and SO+AC groups presented no kidney histological changes. Glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and arteriolosclerosis scores were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in RMR+ AC group when compared with RMR group. There were no significantly differences in interstitial inflammation score between RMR+AC and RMR groups. Conclusion: This preliminary data suggests that pharmacological inhibition of Ras (small GTPase proteins) activation may be a future strategy in the prevention of renal fibrosis. Objective: Opioid addicted patients may inject oral substitution drugs such as methadone or buprenorphine. Some of these drugs contain high molecular polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as an excipient, which is not excreted from the body when given intravenously. PVP deposition is diagnosed histologically by characteristic macrophages with bluish, vacuolated cytoplasm in various tissues. We present a biopsy series from opioid addicted patients showing renal insufficiency as a main clinical sign of PVP deposition disease. Method: Biopsies (n = 28) and one autopsy with characteristic PVP deposition were collected between 2009 and 2013, from 13 opioid addicted patients (mean age 38 years, 12 males, 1 female). Results: Renal biopsies (n = 8) showed interstitial PVP storing macrophages accompanied by various degrees of tubular atrophy and signs of glomerular hypoperfusion. Other main biopsy sites showing the characteristic macrophages were bone/bone marrow (n = 11) and the gastrointestinal tract (n = 5). Main clinical signs were reduced kidney function (mean serum creatinine 219 micromol/L) and anemia (mean hemoglobin 9.9 g/dL). Abdominal discomfort and fractures were found sporadically. Two patients died. One autopsy confirmed PVP deposition as underlying cause of death. Tuesday, 8 September 2015, 17.00-19 .00, Hall 2 OFP-12 Oral Free Paper Session Nephropathology Conclusion: PVP storage is important to recognize histologically in kidney biopsies because it might explain multiorgan affection in opioid addicted patients.",

Grchevska * Faculty of Medicine Skopje, Dept. of Pathology, Republic of Macedonia Objective: Fibroblasts are normally present in the kidney interstitium and myofibroblasts play the main role in the process of interstitial fibrosis. We compared the expression of (myo)fibroblast markers in fetal, normal adult and glomerulonephritic kidneys. Method: We performed immunostainings with Vimentin, alpha-SMA, S100A4, Cadherin 9 and CD34 on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples of 20 fetal, 40 normal adult and 40 glomerulonephritic kidneys with interstitial fibrosis of at least 10 %. Results: The common mesenchymal marker Vimentin was widely expressed in the interstitium of all three groups. All of the fibroblast markers were present in the interstitium of the fetal kidneys and also some tubules showed weak signal for Vimentin and S100A4. In the normal adult kidneys, single interstitial cells were positive for S100A4 and Cadherin 9, while alpha-SMA and CD34 were absent. The tubules were negative for all markers. The glomerulonephritic kidneys hosted numerous interstitial cells positive for all markers with emphasized expression of alpha-SMA, but also atrophic tubules expressing Vimentin, S100A4 and alpha-SMA. Conclusion: After fibrogenic stimulation, the fibroblasts and atrophic tubules in the glomerulonephritic kidneys re-express their fetal phenotype, while the atrophic tubules express de-novo alpha-SMA, thus gaining myofibroblast phenotype.",

Our previous work in rodent models of renal fibrosis has established that calreticulin is up-regulated in tubular epithelial cells. In addition, proteomic analysis of cultured renal tubular epithelial cells over-expressing calreticulin identified up-regulation of the family of 14-3-3 proteins. Based on these findings, we opted to evaluate these proteins in renal biopsies from patients suffering from IgA and membranous nephropathy. Method: Human kidney biopsies were obtained from patients suffering from IgA nephropathy (N = 33) and membranous nephropathy (N = 13). Healthy areas adjacent to renal carcinoma were used as controls (N = 6). Biopsies were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence. and the Image J software. Results: All biopsies from IgA nephropathy patients and membranous nephropathy patients showed intense up-regulation of calreticulin and 14-3-3 proteins specifically in distal tubular epithelial cells, but not in any other renal compartment. Conclusion: Biopsy material findings raise the possibility that calreticulin and 14-3-3 proteins may be novel markers of renal tubular epithelial cells alterations, suggesting an important cross-talk between the glomerular and the tubular compartment.

Kostadinova-Kunovska * Medical Faculty Skopje, Dept. of Pathology, Republic of Macedonia Objective: We aimed to compare the expression of Pax2 and Oct4, two genes responsible for the development and the differentiation of the embryonic stem cells in fetal, normal adult and glomerulonephritic kidneys. Method: We performed immunohistochemical analysis with commercial antibodies against Pax2 and Oct4 on formaline-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples from 20 fetal kidneys with different gestational age, 40 adult and 40 glomerulonephritic kidneys. Results: The analyses showed nuclear presence of both markers in fetal kidneys, in immature blastemic mesenchyme and early glomerular and tubular precursors. The signal persisted in parietal cells with the process of maturation. Weak Pax2 signal was present also in the parietal cells and in some distal tubules of the adult normal kidneys, while Oct4 was negative. Increased signal of both markers in parietal glomerular cells incuding cellular crescents as well in atrophic tubules was observed in the glomerulonephritic kidneys. The interstitial cells in the three groups were negative. Conclusion: The presence of both markers in the immature fetal kidney structures points to the pluripotency of the mesenchymal blastemic cells that precede the mature cells of all types. The presence of Pax2 and Oct4 in parietal epithelial cells and cellular crescents indicates they might be responsible for origin of stem cells in glomerulonephritic kidneys.",

Method: We have applied modification of the direct measurement/ arithmetic mean method to measure GBM thickness on digital EM photographies (30 measurements for each biopsy) using iTEM software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH). Position of measurements in capillary loops was determined similarly as described by Haas (Arch Pathol Lab Med, 2009) . Results: We obtained mean \u00b1 SD values for the normal GBM thickness of adult males and females of 340 \u00b1 36 and 301 \u00b1 44 nm. These values were based on average GBM thickness for each of 23 males and 22 females, aged 19 to 84 years, with minimal change disease, acute interstitial nephritis, normal renal parenchyma or acute tubular injury. Exclusion criteria were hematuria and diabetes mellitus. We defined normal ranges for each gender (268-412 nm for males, 213-389 for females), as being within 2 SD of these means. Conclusion: With this research we have standardized method for GBM thickness measurement and defined referential span of normal GBM thickness for our laboratory. These results are crucial for accurate diagnosis of disorders characterized with structural changes of GBM. Objective: Chronic antibody mediated rejection with transplant glomerulopathy (TxG) is one of the major causes of late renal allograft loss. However, renal survival of TxG is variable and morphologic correlates of poor outcome are not well defined. The aim of this study was to identify ultrastructural markers predictive of less favorable renal prognosis in TxG. Method: Forty-eight patients with TxG but no additional significant comorbidities biopsied at UCSF between 2007 and 2012 were enrolled into the study. Fifteen management biopsies, 6 month post-transplant, served as controls. Ultrastructural quantitative morphometric data, laboratory and serological variables were correlated with renal survival. Results: The glomerular and peritubular capillaries were markedly thickened in TxG (938 \u00b1 368 and 350 \u00b1 121 nm, respectively) relative to controls (346 \u00b1 27 and 140 \u00b1 12 nm, respectively). Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the TxG group was 36,13 \u00b1 17, 86 ml/min/1,73m2. With a median follow-up of 50.35 months, multivariable Cox-regression analysis of patients with TxG revealed the significant negative prognostic value of decreased eGFR (hazard ratio = 0, 328{0,128-0,841}, p = 0,020; per 1 SD increase) and increased mean harmonic glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width (HR = 1,558{1, 021-2,378}, p = 0,040; per 1 SD increase). Conclusion: Our data suggest that measurement of GBM thickness in kidney allograft biopsies with TxG can improve prognostication for renal survival.",

Results: Data on 21 cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 were identified in 16 men (76.2 %) and 5 women (23. 8 %) . Transplanted patients accounted for 9 cases. The mean age at diagnosis was 64 years (33-74). pT1 disease was found in 19 patients with a mean tumour size of 2.5 cm. Twenty patients were treated successfully with radical nephrectomy, and 1 with tumourectomy. Three cases had multiple tumours and 1 patient had bilateral disease. Among the 21 cases the majority were papillary carcinomas (low grade), other diagnosis were conventional clear cell carcinomas, chromophobe carcinomas, and 2 unclassified renal cell carcinomas.

Method: As a feasibility study 375 diagnoses were made solely on digital slides by one nephropathologist. Results: Positive experiences can be summarized as follows: 1. Every digital slide is just \"one\" mouse click away no matter where you are, if only internet is accessible. 2. This applies even for previous biopsies. 3. Microscopic findings can be followed effortlessly through series of sections. 4. Comparison of immunohistochemical stains by viewing the slides simultaneously side by side allows for superior interpretation. 5. Measurements, e.g. of glomerular size, are easily performed. 6. Annotations allow documentation of important findings. 7. Biopsies can easily be demonstrated in clinicopathological conferences, even with remote participants. 8. Annotations hugely facilitate demonstration of renal biopsy findings. 9. Clinicians may have access to renal biopsies from their patients. 10. Collaboration between researchers is facilitated.

Borrel bodies are now recognized as elementary bodies or virions of this Pox viruses. Twenty years before Borrel, Csokor published paper about fine structure of Fowl pox with detailed line-drawings. In comparison of Csokor's drawings and photographs in Goodpasteure's paper, the structure of fowl pox cytopathic effect is identically described. Csokor's paper about fine structure of fowl pox -\"Ueber den feineren Bau der Gefl\u00fcgelpocke (Epithelioma Contagiosum B)\", was published 1884 in Mittheilungen des Ornithologischen Vereines in Wien, in three consecutive issues, on pages 13, 21-25, and 39-42. Although was published 20 years before Borrel's paper \"Sur les Inclusions de L'Epithelioma Contagieux des Oiseaux (molluscum contagiosum)\" Comptes Rendus de la Soc. de Biologie 1904, pp. 642-3, Csokor's paper not been mentioned by others, maybe that Ornithology journal was not been read by pathologist or microbiologist. Conclusion: We propose that elementary bodies in fowl pox must be renamed as Csokor's bodies, especially that Borrel paper is very short and without illustrations. Objective: Lung granulomas play an important role in pulmonology, but their etiology frequently stay unclear. In routine practice the differential diagnostics is usually reduced to tuberculosis and sarcoidosis in spite of probable role of other pathogens. Method: We analyzed seven cases (patients in age 15-55 ys) with history of focal lung lesions in which clinical and immunological data could not allow to diagnose firmly either tuberculosis, nor sarcoidosis. Operational and/or bioptic material of lungs and/ or lymph nodes was investigated histologically. In all cases Ziehl-Neelsen and PAS -stainings were provided. Immunehistochemistry included sera against CD68, M.tuberculosis complex, Toxoplasma gondii, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumonia. Results: In all cases histologically were revealed non necrotic macrophageous granulomas (CD68+), cytoplasm of many cells contained small vacuoles and small PAS-positive dots. No acid fast bacteria or antigen of Mycobacteria were present in investigated slices. In 4 cases we have found strong expression of M. pneumonia, and in 3 -C. trachomatis antigens. Conclusion: The comparison of clinical, immunological, histological and immunohistochemical data allows to diagnose practically not known before Mycoplasma and Chlamydia etiology of macrophageous granulomas in lungs and lymph node, which seem to be not rear.",

The authors present the cardiovascular anatomopathological collection of a Portuguese Hospital. Method: The collection comprises specimens received, for anatomopathological examination, from Cardiothoracic and General Surgery Departments and from Cardiology / Pediatric Cardiology Hemodynamics Units; as well as material harvested during autopsies. They have been prepared and kept, first, in alcohol-glicerin and lately in formalin; and adequately cataloged in an anonymous way. Results: At present, the Museum contains hundreds of specimens of Congenital Cardiopathies, of Cardiac and Vascular Acquiered Diseases, of Post-surgical Material and of Transplanted-related Hearts (both native and explanted); whose examples will be showed. Conclusion: Following the footsteps of other international Institutions, CHLO began collecting cardiovascular specimens in 1983. It is an ensemble of both very typical cases and of rare specimens, mainly used for teaching purposes during courses and residencies. It is an active / dynamic Museum, that contributes to the scientific formation of younger generations of Medical Doctors belonging to different specialties. Both proliferation index (PI) and progesterone receptor (PgR) expression may be used to distinguish between luminal A and B subtypes. The cutoff point 20 % of PI has been accepted by the most of experts.The commonly applied method of determining PI is its rough assessment by pathologist's eye. The only precise method is one-by-one nuclei counting throughout microscopic field. However it is rarely encountered in routine diagnostics, because this method is laborious and time-consuming. Method: We developed a new image segmentation algorithm, which combines both Pawlak's data mining concept and fuzzy reasoning. The proposed approach was implemented and tested over histopathology images. The archival slides stained with MIB-1 antibody derived from 21 female invasive breast cancer patients. The results were compared with reference values which were obtained by precise nuclei counting (cell counter plugin for ImageJ application). Results: The study showed strong correlation (r = 0,84, p < 0,05) between PI assessed by our method and reference values. Conclusion: The results revealed usefulness of our method in proliferation index evaluation. The system needs further improvements which are currently under development. Objective: Nowadays, gross examination (GE) of surgical specimens in Portugal is performed by pathology assistants/ biomedical scientists (BMS), residents and pathologists. Our aim is to compare the GE of colon and rectal tumour specimens performed by these three professional groups. Method: The GE of 179 specimens (61 BMS; 58 residents; 60 pathologists) was compared according to: number of blocks submitted, number of lymph nodes (LN) harvested, smallest LN and smallest metastatic LN. Statistical analysis was performed (t-Student; \u03b1 = 0,05). Results: Statistical significance was observed between: BMS/ residents and pathologists in the number of blocks without LN (p = 0,36/p < 0,0001) and number of LN harvested (p = 0,37/ p < 0,0001); BMS and residents/pathologists in the size of the smallest LN (p < 0,002/p = 0,07); BMS, residents and pathologists in the number of tumour blocks (p < 0,02). No statistical significance was observed between BMS, residents and pathologists in the size of the smallest metastatic LN (p = 0,81/p = 0,72/p = 0,52). Conclusion: In colon and rectal tumour specimens, BMS/residents show a better LN retrieval and BMS harvest the smallest LN. However, BMS/ residents submit more blocks without LN compared to pathologists. These results suggest a promising BMS performance in the GE of the studied specimens. Objective: The semiquantitative method utilized in routine pathology to determine Ki-67 proliferation index (KIPI) might be associated with remarkable intra-/interobsever variability. Thus, we aimed to compare the conventional semiquantitative method (SQ) and digital pathological image-analysis processes (full automation = FA, semi-automation = SA) for the detection of KIPI. Method: In our study, 188 estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients' samples (diagnosed through 1999-2002) and follow-up data were included with a median follow-up of 8.6 years. Tissue microarrays were prepared from the representative paraffin-embedded tumour blocks. After performing Ki-67 (MIB1) immunoreaction, SQ, SA and FA were applied to digital slides. Results: Dichotomizing Ki-67 index value, according to the 2013 St. Gallen guideline, significant difference was detected between the FA, SA and SQ (p < 0.001, for all comparisons). For prognostic prediction, none of the three was able to perform statistically significant splitting the cohort at 14 %, although the SQ proved to be slightly superior to the digital analysis at 20 % cut-point (p = 0.033). Conclusion: Despite digital image-analysis processes are more objective methods, and they might be able to reduce intra-/interobserver variability, further refinement and validation are needed to verify applicability of tumour pattern recognition software in pathological routine before further utilization in the routine setting.",

Spindelb\u00f6ck * Medizin. Universit\u00e4t Graz, Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie, Austria Objective: We report on a novel form of antibiotic-associated colitis presenting with intractable watery high volume diarrhea in intensive care unit (ICU) patients following concomitant therapy with steroids. All patients presented with severe enterocolitis and showed histologic patterns resembling gastro-intestinal (GI) graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), with dramatically increased epithelial cell apoptosis and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell infiltration as well as highly reduced CD4+ T-cell counts in the GI mucosa. Method: Microbiota analysis of biopsy and stool samples including short-chain fatty acid measurements as well as immunophenotyping of biopsy specimens were used to discern the pathogenesis of this novel form of apoptotic enterocolitis. Results: Microbiota analyses performed during the course of disease revealed a severe dysbiotic intestinal microbiota with severe overgrowth of Proteobacteria, including the presence of opportunistic pathogens like Haemophilus parainfluencae, and the loss of the physiological Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes colonization. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) performed in one patient with this potentially fatal disease lead to rapid improvement of symptoms, mucosal healing and restored intestinal dysbiosis. Conclusion: The eradication of the phsiological GI microbiota seems to be the main driver of this disease. The efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation indicates a possible therapeutic option for this often fatal condition. Objective: Central neurocytoma (CN) is tumour consisting of round cells with neuronal differentiation, located at the foramen of Monro. Rarely, ganglion cell differentiation is reported; such tumours have been designated central 'ganglioneurocytoma'. Since the term was introduced in 1990 however, this variant of CN has remained poorly recognized. We report a case of central 'ganglioneurocytoma'. Method: A 40 year old female presented with right hemiparesis. Neuroimaging showed a 63 mm solid-cystic tumour in the lateral ventricles, suggestive of CN. The tumour showed uniform round cells typical of CN. There was also widespread ganglion cell differentiation and tumour cells with transitional features between typical neurocytoma cells and ganglion cells. Abundant fibrillary matrix, a delicate vascular network and calcifications were seen. There was no mitotic activity, necrosis or microvascular proliferation. NeuN showed strong nuclear labeling of the tumour cells including the neurocytoma cells, ganglion cells and cells with transitional morphology. Synaptophysin was positive. Results: A variant of CN (WHO grade II) was diagnosed. There was no tumour recurrence 46 months post-excision. Conclusion: Central 'ganglioneurocytoma' is rare. It must be distinguished from extraventricular neurocytoma and ganglioglioma with an oligodendroglial component, and from more aggressive entities including oligodendroglial neoplasms with ganglioglioma-like maturation, and cerebral ganglioneuroblastoma. Objective: Lumbar synovial cysts are rare. We present a case of hemorrhagic synovial cyst that reinforces the opinion that synovial and ganglion cysts are stages in a cycle of cyst formation and degeneration. Method: A 64 year-old female patient with a 3-month history of lumbar pain and right S1 radiculopathy was presented. She had also a 4-year history of right-sided lumbosciatalgia and neurogenic intermittent claudication for which she underwent L4-L5 fusion 2 years ago. MRI revealed a partially cystic lesion (1,9 cm) at the right L5-S1 foramen, which was removed surgically. Results: Sections from the lesion revealed a cyst, the wall of which consisted of bundles of collagen fibers. There were many slit or starshaped vessels, as demonstrated by CD34 stain, hemorrhagic areas and deposits of hemosiderin, giving the impression of vascular lesion. Despite multiple sections only focally the cystic wall was coated by synovium. Conclusion: Synovial lining may be found only focally and in such cases multiple sections are needed in order to differentiate them from ganglion cysts. The cyst wall may be highly and/or abnormally vascularized, due to angiogenic factors produced by synovium. Clinicopathological correlation is recommended in order to reach the correct diagnosis.",

Intracellular deposition of TDP-43 is the hallmark of a frequent subgroup of cases with FTLD. Mutations in the sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) gene have rarely been found in individuals with FTD. Method: We provided a comprehensive clinicopathological description of two cases. Results: The clinical phenotype of patient 1 was compatible with the behavioral variant (bv) of FTD. Genetic analysis revealed a nonsense mutation NP_003891.1:p.(Glu396*) in SQSTM1. TDP-43 pathology was compatible mostly with the features of type B, however, neuronal granular cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactivity was numerous and abundant oligodendroglial inclusions were seen in the white matter. The clinical phenotype of patient 2 was compatible with bvFTD associated with parkinsonism and bulbar symptoms in the later stage. Genetic testing of patient 2 identified a C9orf72 repeat expansion mutation together with a missense mutation NP_003891.1:p.Arg212Cys in SQSTM1. TDP-43 pathology was characterized by neuritic profiles and oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions compatible mostly with type A of FTLD-TDP pathology similar to cases with the C9orf72 mutation. Conclusion: Our study expands the neuropathology spectrum of genes associated with FTLD-TDP. Objective: To report the case of a female with an ependymal tumour with sarcomatous differentiation -ependymosarcoma. Gliosarcomas, a variant of glioblastoma, are composed of glial and sarcomatous components. In most cases the glial component is astrocytic but can also be oligodendroglial or ependymal. Method: A 44-year-old female, with a history of intracranial hemorrhage, presented with frontotemporal headache and aggravation of the already existing motor deficits. The CT-scan revealed a left frontal, 70 \u00d7 40 mm, heterogeneous lesion. She was submitted to a craniotomy. Results: A 10 gr specimen of multiple white fragments was received. The specimen was composed of an ependymal component of rounded or elongated cells with eosinophilic and ill defined cytoplasm and irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei, collected around blood vessels forming pseudorosettes and a spindle cell component with marked nuclear atypia intermingled with fascicles of reticulin fibers. The mitotic count was very high in both populations. The immunohistochemical study revealed positivity of the first population for EMA (focally and dot-like), GFAP and S-100 Protein and the second population, for SMA and focally for S-100 Protein. Conclusion: The patient was submitted to adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and she is alive for 4 months now. Ependymosarcomas are rare tumours with less than 20 cases reported so far.",

            "text": "OFP- 14- Results: Twenty two cases of gliosarcoma were identified. The mean age was 55.1 years and the patients were mainly males (12 males and 10 females). The lesions were predominantly located in the temporal lobe (54,5 %) but also in the frontal (31,8 %) , parietal (4,5 %) and occipital lobes (4,5 %) and thalamus (4,5 %). Six patients were previously diagnosed with glioblastoma and one, with ganglioglioma. In one case the glial component demonstrated to be of ependymal nature and in two cases, oligodendroglial. Mesenchymal differentiation was observed in one case, neuronal differentiation in two, muscle differentiation in four and blood vessel differentiation in one (some cases presented with more than one differentiation). Conclusion: Gliosarcoma has a poor prognosis. Twelve of the patients (54,5 %) have already died (mean survival: 6,5 months), eight are alive, three with evidence of disease (13, 6 %) and five with no evidence of disease (22,7 %) Objective: Vitamin C deficiency in humans and guinea pigs cause disturbance in collagen synthesis. We based the experiment on the fact that the integrity of pial basement membrane (PBM) is essential for the proper neuron migration. Method: The experiment included pregnant guinea pigs divided in a control, and 2 experimental groups, E1 and E2. Vitamin C deprivation began on the 20th day of gestation for group E1 and on the 10th day for group E2 and continued until the 50th day of pregnancy, when the all groups were euthanized. Fetuses were removed, perfused with fixative and the brain was removed from the scull. Midsagittal section from the cerebellar vermis was immunohistochemicaly analyzed (with anticollagen IV, anti-Ki-67, and anti-GFAP antibody). Results: We found excessive overmigration of the external germinal layer cells into the subarachnoid space of the cerebellum through defects in the PBM. The changes ranged from focal rupture of PBM to their complete disintegration with severe cerebellar dysplasia. The cerebellar surface was flattered.",

Plate -Gross and pathohistological characteristics of experimental Lissencephaly; Dorsal view of normal cerebellum in control group ( Fig. 1) and absence of folia and sulci on the cerebellar surface in E2 group (Fig. 2) . Low (Fig. 3) Objective: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are malignant neuroectodermal tumours which present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Morphological diversity include primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET)-like morphology. We explored expression of a panel of PNET-associated markers along with neuroectodermal stem cell markers. Method: SOX-10, SOX-2, p75NTR, CD99, FLI-1, WT-1 was permormed by IHC on 96 MPNST cases (30 with known NF1). Results: Briefly; >50 % of the cases showed positive reaction with p75NTR and SOX-10, >25 % of them were positive with CD99, Fli-1 and WT-1. SOX-2 was positive for 20 %. There was significant positive correlation between CD99 and SOX-2, WT-1 and SOX-10 immunostaining. Regarding the whole series; p75NTR immunostaining was significantly positively correlated with both WT-1 and SOX-10 immunostaining. For the NF1 cases; SOX-2 staining was significantly correlated with Fli-1 and SOX-10. Conclusion: Some neuroectodermal stem cell markers such as P75NTR and SOX10 were frequently expressed by MPNSTs. This might be a helpful diagnostic tool and might also help to understand the etiopathogenesis. The PNET -associated markers should also be cautiously interpreted in MPNST suspicous cases. To focus on the primitive neuroectodermal cell features and neural stem cell features of these rare and aggressive tumours might also enable identification of specific targets for the development of therapies. Objective: To explore the utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) against BRAF (V600E) mutant protein in FFPE tissue from low grade CNS tumours. Method: A cohort of 204 low-grade gliomas was successfully evaluated for BRAF (V600E) mutation using IHC on tissue microarrays (n = 198) and/or whole tissue sections (n = 10), including 101 sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas (S-PA), 12 NF1-associated PA, 12 anaplastic PA (APA), 29 diffuse astrocytomas (DA), 14 gangliogliomas (GG), 9 low-grade astrocytomas NOS (LGA), 7 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA), 4 DNETs, 4 angiocentric gliomas (AG), 3 low-grade glioneuronal tumours (LGGT), 3 SEGA, and 6 pediatric oligodendrogliomas (POD). DNA sequencing data was available in a subset of cases (n = 7). Results: BRAF (V600E) mutant protein was identified in 16/204 (8 %) cases across all tumours tested, including 5/101 S-PAs, 1/12 APA, 5/14 GGs, 4/7 PXAs (one with anaplastic features), and 1/29 DA. All NF1-PA, DNET, AG, LGA, LGGT and SEGAwere negative. When looking at this subset of tumours with BRAF (V600E), the mean age of presentation was 21.2 years (ranging from 0.5 to 47 years). Cases were grade I (n = 11) or grade II (n = 5). There was a perfect correlation between IHC on TMA and whole sections (n = 4) and between IHC TMA results and sequencing (BRAF V600E present in 3 and absent in 4). Conclusion: BRAF V600E can be detected by IHC in a subset of lowgrade glial and glioneuronal tumours, especially in PXA, GG and PA. The findings support the feasibility of BRAF (V600E) IHC testing on TMAs for low grade glioma and glioneuronal tumours, which merits further investigation.",

Method: Case 1: A 10-month old male child with irritability, neck hyperextension and a bulging fontanelle. MRI revealed a 68 mm predominantly solid mass, centered in the left lateral ventricle. Case 2: a 2-year old girl, with language delay admitted for seizures and fever. MRI revealed a 57 mm solid tumour in the upper part of the tentorium, with a mass effect on the left temporal lobe and hippocampus. Results: In both cases, histological examination revealed a highly cellular spindle cell tumour, with a fascicular pattern, with elongated nuclei without prominent atypia. Mitoses were readily identified. Silver staining showed a dense reticulin network. Single cells were en-sheathed by argyrophilic fibers. The tumour cells strongly expressed vimentin, with focal and weak expression of actin. No expression of GFAP, S100, synaptophysin, desmin, EMA, cytokeratins, CD34 or beta-catenin was observed. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the gene fusion transcript ETV6-NTRK3 was negative. Neither tumour has recurred 3 months after resection. Conclusion: Intracranial fibrosarcoma arising spontaneously is extremely rare. Although it is postulated to arise from meninges, vessel walls or choroid plexus, the origin remains controversial. Objective: The hypothesis that hemangiopericytoma (HPC) and solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) form a spectrum of the same entity has been reinforced by the discovery of the recurrent NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene. The still used dichotomy of CNS SFT and HPC is based on different clinical behavior. We evaluated the molecular characteristics and expression of STAT6 in 58 CNS SFTs/HPCs and correlated the molecular data with histopathological parameters. Method: Cases were reviewed and graded (WHO grade I, II, III). Immunohistochemistry for STAT6 and RT-PCR for detection of NAB2-STAT6 fusion were performed. Results: All cases tested (n = 31) showed nuclear STAT6 expression. NAB2-STAT6 fusion transcripts were found in 49/58 (85 %) cases. The most common fusion variant, NAB2 exon 6 and STAT6 exon 17/18 (n = 37), did not show a clear predilection for one of the malignancy grades. NAB2 exon 4 and STAT6 exon 3 was detected in 12 cases; only to one of these cases WHO grade III was assigned. Conclusion: Detection of NAB2-STAT6 fusion and the resulting nuclear expression of STAT6 protein are robust tools for the diagnosis of CNS SFTs/HPCs and underscore that they belong to the same entity. NAB2 exon 4 and STAT6 exon 3 fusion was associated with morphologically \"lower grade\". Objective: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most devastating neoplastic tumours and current therapies can only marginally improve overall survival. One rate limiting step of protein synthesis is translation initiation monitored by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Deregulation of these proteins might lead to uncontrolled cell growth and malignant transformation. The mechanism of action of eIFs is associated with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Method: Expression of eIFs and mTOR related proteins was analyzed in human astrocytoma samples (grade I-IV) by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. For mRNA, qRT-PCR results and expression microarray data sets were evaluated. Mouse xenograft models of astrocytomas were treated with various chemotherapeutics and screened for their effects on eIFs. Results: A protein expression profile of all eIF subunits revealed a significant deregulation for most eIFs in all tumour grades compared to controls. Interestingly, different expression patterns could be observed between low and high grade gliomas. Moreover, xenografts displayed unexpected profile changes upon treatment. Temozolomide drastically down-regulated eIF expression, whereas other established drugs even exhibited inverse effects. Conclusion: Deregulation of eIFs in gliomagenesis may provide the fundament for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prolong the survival of high grade glioma patients, in particular GBM.",

Fields * Mayo Clinic, Dept. of Pathology, Jacksonville, FL, USA Objective: Due to advances in individualized treatment of lung cancer, pathologists are required to discriminate between squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADCA) of the lung in small specimens, while also preserving tissue for molecular studies. We have developed a simple, single chromogen antibody cocktail that takes advantage of differential localizations of SCC marker DSG3 (cell membrane staining) and lung ADCA marker TTF-1 (nuclear staining). Method: To investigate the utility of this antibody cocktail, tissue microarrays were constracted of 101 SCCs and 113 ADCAs of the lung. The tumours were classified according to the 2011 IASLC/ATS/ERS criteria. Deparaffinized sections were stained with a mixture of DSG3 and TTF-1 antibodies. In comparison, a p63 antibody was also evaluated. Results: Staining results for the DSG3/TTF-1 cocktail were as follows: sensitivity and specificity of DSG3 for SCC were 87 and 100 %, respectively; sensitivity and specificity of TTF-1 for ADCA were 87 and 100 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of p63 single stain for SCC were 99 and 74 %, respectively. Conclusion: DSG/TTF-1 is a simple, single chromogen antibody cocktail that can be effectively utilized in distinguishing SCC and ADCA of the lung. Although the sensitivity of DSG3 is lower, its specificity exceeds that of p63.",

            "text": "Objective: Pulmonary adenocarcinomas express EGFR in variable intensities and quantities, regardless of the EGFR mutation. The internal domain of EGFR has eight phosphorylation sites at position Tyr845, Tyr992, Tyr1045, Ser1046, Ser1047, Tyr1068, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173. Each of these phosphorylation sites has different binding partners, which can issue either activation or degradation of the receptor. It is not known whether phosphorylation in pulmonary adenocarcinomas occurs randomly or specifically. Method: Three tissue microarrays (TMA) were produced. One contained 345 cases of primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas (resection specimen), another consisted of acinar and papillary adenocarcinomas, half of which with EGFR mutations. A third TMA consisted of 74 mucinous adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutations (all EGFR mutation negative). Antibodies for phosphorylated EGFR at 845, 1045 , 1068 , 1148 , and 1173 were used. Results: In EGFR mutated adenocarcinomas phosphorylation was commonly found on Tyr845 and Tyr1148, whereas in mucinous adenocarcinomas it was commonly seen only at Tyr1148. On the large TMA the following phosphorylations were uncommon: 1045, 1068, 1173, whereas 845 and 1148 were commonly seen. In some cases there was an additional nuclear expression, pointing to a translocation of the phosphorylated receptor into the nucleus. Conclusion: From this initial study it seems that non-mucinous adenocarcinomas preferentially show phosphorylation at Tyr845 and 1148, which points to the activation of SRC kinases as well as MAP kinases, respectively as the downstream signaling pathways. Objective: Pleomorphic carcinoma (PLMC) is rare and reported with poor outcome due to aggressive biological behavior and undeterminated response to chemotherapy. FGFR1 has emerged as a potential molecular target, especially in Lung Epidermoid Carcinoma (SQC). In order to define targeted therapies and improve survival, 10 PLMC were studied. Method: A basic IHC panel (including CK7, CK5.6, TTF1 and Vi m e n t i n ) d e f i n e d P L M C a n d F G F R 1 P o l y c l o n a l A B -ThermoScientific and FISH (FGFR1(8p11)/SE8(D8Z1) Kreatech, Leica Biosystems. were applied. Results: Patients' median age was 74, between 56 and 82 years, 7 men and 3 women. The main histological pattern was adenocarcinoma (ADC) in 8 (80 %) cases and SQC in 2(20 %) cases; all cases had 3+ FGFR1 general expression, without differences between PLMC with ADC or SQC component. FGFR1 FISH positivity was present in 3(30 %) cases: 2(100 %) with SQC and 1(12.5 %) with ADC component. Conclusion: In this small series, FGFR1 amplification was more frequent in those PLMC with SQC epithelial component. No correlation was found between IHC and FISH results but protein overexpression seemed to be more frequent in PLMC than in ADC and SQC (unpublished data). FGFR1 amplification and protein expression should then be searched in this group of tumours in order to define score to include patients in targeted therapy, as already defined by some authors. (14.5 %) were NSCLC without features of glandular, squamous or neuroendocrine differentiation. Of these it was possible to favor a more specific diagnosis in all but five cases (3.0 %).",

Method: After informed consent, clinical and pathological data are captured and relevant HBM is collected centrally for quality assessment. Correlating mutational signatures via next generation sequencing with clinical/pathological data from long term patient follow-up is pivotal in SPECTA. Tumour samples are collected and stored under the guardianship of a pathologist. NGS data is reported to treating physicians under the auspices of SPECTA Molecular Advisory Board consisting of pathologists, molecular biologists and clinical oncologists. Results: Launched in 2013, SPECTAcolor for colorectal cancer patients is initiated in 22 centers in 9 countries. As of March 2015, more than 600 patients are enrolled with 587 accepted tumour samples at the biobank in Dresden and 13 rejected samples due to insufficient quality (absence of viable tumour cells) or quantity (low number of tumour cells). Four hundred ninety seven samples were analyzed for baseline biomarkers with mean turnaround time of 17 days between sample receipt and biomarker status reporting. Conclusion: SPECTAcolor is the first international longitudinally clinically annotated tumour tissue biobank and biomarker analysis platform. Its success proves that a logistically complex infrastructure to run innovative trials in a multinational setting is feasible. SPECTA will be extended to thoracic malignancies (SPECTAlung), melanoma (SPECTAmel) and neuro-oncology (SPECTAbrain). SPECTA for rare tumours is being developed.",

Method: 50 patients with a total of 568 lymph nodes were evaluated independently by two pathologists. 188 of the lymph nodes were examined in 3 levels and all 568 lymph nodes were stained using broad spectrum keratin. A positive lymph node was defined as a lymph node demonstrating isolated tumour cells, micro-or macrometastases in at least one H&E level or by immunohistochemistry. Results: The two observers identified 58 and 67 positive lymph nodes respectively in, the same, 25 patients. The two observers detected 32 and 36 lymph nodes containing isolated tumour cells by immunohistochemistry but only four and 14 on H&E. Both observers identified 26 lymph nodes with micro-or macro metastases by immunohistochemistry vs. 24 on H&E. The additional micrometastases were found in two different patients. One of the patients was upstaged from N1 to N2, using the AJCC staging system. Additional levels were found to change the size and category of metastases. Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry is helpful in detecting isolated tumour cells that would otherwise have been missed, however rarely leads to upstaging. Objective: Resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs represent the major impediment for the successful treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Recently, it has been shown that cytoskeletal protein Filamin A is required for efficient DNA damage repair and modulates cisplatin sensitivity in vitro. We investigated the relationship between the expression levels of filamin A protein and survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer patients, treated with adjuvant Carboplatin and Navelbine. Method: We analyzed filamin A protein expression in resection specimens from 135 non-small cell lung cancer patients, from which 73 patients were treated with adjuvant Carboplatin and Navelbine, and 62 patients did not receive adjuvant treatment. Archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically using EP2405Y antibody against C-terminus of filamin A. Results: Cox regression analysis of survival showed that increased expression of filamin A protein (histoscore > 90) is significantly related with shorter overall survival (HR = 1.005, 95 %CI[1.000;1.010], p = 0.037) and disease free survival (HR = 1.004, 95 %CI [1.001:1.008], p = 0,017) in patients with adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Such relationship was not seen in patients without adjuvant treatment. Conclusion: Filamin A expression might represent a novel potential predictive marker of platinum-based treatment outcome in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer. Objective: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with tumours that harbor EGFR sensitizing mutations are eligible for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) due to a high likelihood of response. The majority of EGFR mutations are exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R point mutations. However, most patients will eventually develop resistance and show disease progression. We followed NSCLC patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations by measuring EGFR mutations in plasma during TKI treatment. Method: We collected baseline tumour tissue and plasma samples from patients prior to TKI therapy and at approximately 8 week intervals after initiation of therapy (plasma only). We used the cobas\u00ae EGFR Mutation Test for tissue (CE-IVD) and plasma (under development, Roche, Pleasanton, CA). Results: Thirteen patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations in tumour tissue have been enrolled in the study (9 exon 19 deletions, 2 exon 21 L858R mutations, 2 exon 18 G719X mutations). All but one baseline plasma samples were mutation positive. After initiation of TKI treatment, subsequent plasma testing showed no EGFR mutation in three patients and a decrease in two patients. No EGFR resistance mutations have been detected.",

For 14 cases with EGFR mutations (7 exon 19 deletions, 4 exon 21 L858R mutations, 2 exon 18 G719X mutations, 1 T790M resistance mutation), we assessed the difference of a semi-quantitative index between replicates. There were 5 discordant cases between paired samples (three for exon 19 deletions, one for exon 21 point mutation L858R, and one for resistance mutation T790M).

Rudzinski, D. Giedronowicz, E. Szczepulska-Wojcik, P. Ronduda, B. Maksymiuk, T. Orlowski * Nat. Tub. and Lung Dis., Res. Institute, Pathology Dept., Warsaw, Poland Objective: The new WHO histological classification of lung tumours describes such proliferations as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and invasive adenocarcinomas (InvADC). Differentiation all these entities based only on histological criteria often is difficult. Aim: To observe the usefulness of immunohistochemical reactions in differentiation of AAH, AIS, MIA and InvADC. Method: Twelve AAH cases, 7 AIS, 3 MIA and 12 InvADC were stained with anti-calponin-1, SMA and podoplanin antibody. The presence and intensity of the reactions in the stroma was assessed. Results: Calponin was negative in AAH cases (6/12), short fibers were observed in AAH (6/12), AIS (3/7) and InvADC (1/12), short and long distinct fibers was in AIS (3/7) and MIA (1/3), numerous long fibers were seen in InvADC (11/12), MIA (2/12) and AIS (1/12). SMA: positive reaction direct under the epithelial cells was seen in all preinvasive lesions. Dense reaction in the stroma concerned InvADC (11/12) and MIA (2/3). Podoplanin expressed by stromal cells was detected only in InvADC (8/12). Small lymphatic vessels proliferation was observed in all lesions except AAH. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical reactions with calponin, SMA or podoplanin can be useful in differentiation AAH, AIS, MIA and InvADC. Intense stromal reaction with SMA and calponin seems to be the most diagnostic for invasion and lymphatic vessels proliferation for distinction neoplastic proliferations from AAH. Objective: We hypothesized that large airway inflammation (lymphocytic bronchitis) may be predictor of developing chronic lung allograft rejection (CLAD). CLAD includes bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS). Current grading system grades only small airway inflammation from B0 to B2R. Large airway inflammation is not included in the grading system. Any grade of small airway rejection, without accompanying acute vascular rejection is associated with an increased risk of BOS. Method: We evaluated 311 biopsies from 71 patients and graded large airway inflammation following grading system for small airway inflammation. Clinical follow-up was obtained regarding presence or absence of CLAD. Results: 10 biopsies from 9 patients met criteria for large airway rejection. 8 of the patients had a B1R and 1 had B2R. 5 of 9 patients (56 %) were subsequently diagnosed with CLAD. Three of nine patients (33 %) developed BOS and 2 of 9 patients (22 %) developed RAS. Two of the patients had donor specific antibodies (DSA). Eight of nine patients had concurrent vascular rejection or vascular rejection in any of the previous/ follow up biopsies (2 had A1 and 6 had A2). Conclusion: Our results show that large airway inflammation may be associated with developing CLAD.",

The ESP Colon External Quality Assessment (EQA) scheme was able to monitor how quickly laboratories expanded their testing procedures. Method: Diagnostic reports, submitted by the participants from two consecutive EQA rounds were reviewed to determine which codons were included in the laboratory's tests. Results: Only exon 2 (codon 12 and 13), one of the three required RAS exons, is covered routinely by all participating laboratories. In 2014, 45 and 57 % of the participating laboratories tested for codon 59 in KRAS and NRAS respectively. In 2015, this improved to 67 % for KRAS and 71 % for NRAS. Also codon 117 (78 % of laboratories) and 146 (88 %) of NRAS still show shortcomings to cover the requirements. A shift towards next generation sequencing and a decrease in the use of non-commercial methods was observed. Conclusion: The time pressure to change routine test procedures compromises adherence to updated regulatory guidelines. Two consecutive EQA rounds demonstrated progress in the implementation of complete RAS testing, and emphasized that EQA participation is indispensable to monitor performance and quality assurance. Objective: BRAF is mutated in approx. Ten percent of colorectal cancers (CRC). In addition to its diagnostic role in Lynch syndrome, BRAFV600E is a prognostic factor in metastatic CRC and a potential predictive biomarker for future combined therapies. Here, we validate the VE1 antibody against BRAFV600E, assess heterogeneity and investigate clinicopathological associations of VE1 in CRC patients. Method: VE1 immunohistochemistry was performed on cell lines, whole tissue sections and a next-generation tissue microarray (ngTMA) of 33 cases, with known mutational status. Additional ngTMAs were investigated: 1) primary/metastasis cohort of 14 patients with punches from all tumour blocks (n = 100 areas), 2) colon cancer cohort (n = 259 patients) with six punches/resection, 3) preoperative biopsies (n = 125 patients).",

VE1-positivity correlated with older age (p = 0.0455), mucinous histology (p = 0.0277), right-sided location (p = 0.001), tumour grade (p < 0.001), MLH1-deficiency (p < 0.0001), and poor prognosis in pM1 patients (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: VE1 is highly specific and sensitive for V600E mutation and correlates with expected clinicopathological features. Because of low/no heterogeneity within the same tumour samples, TMA studies using VE1 are feasible. Objective: The accurate diagnosis of malignancy of in situ carcinomas settled on adenomatous polyps is sometimes very difficult because microinfiltrative areas in endoscopic biopsies are subtle changes. Our hypothesis is that the presence of COL11A1 (described as a marker of tumour infiltration) in endoscopic biopsies of colon may be associated with microinfiltrative early changes. Method: Immunohistochemistry for pro-COL11A1 (1E8.33, Oncomatrix) was performed in samples of colon adenocarcinoma (10), non tumoural o polypoid lesions (21) and in situ carcinomas settled on adenomatous polyps (23), 13 of which showed infiltration in the subsequent surgical biopsy. We considered as positive any lesion presenting at least one stained fibroblast. Results: Nine out of ten adenocarcinomas presented COL11A1 immunostaining, while none of benign lesions presented COL11A1 expression (p < 0.0001). Comparison between in situ lesions that presented subsequent infiltration respect of which were pure in situ showed statistical significance (p = 0.0027) because 7 out of 13 cases that confirmed infiltration were positive, while none of the ten pure in situ showed immunolabeling. Conclusion: To conclude, expression of COL11A1 in endoscopic biopsies from in situ carcinomas settled on adenomatous polyps is associated with a higher probability of presenting infiltration in the entire lesion.",

Identifying markers of response will help select patients more likely to benefit from therapy. Objective of the study is to identify at diagnosis proteomic profiles associated with tumour regression grading (TRG) in rectal cancer. Method: This study includes 40 patients with rectal cancer treated with CRT followed by surgery. Proteins from pre-treatment tumour biopsies and control from paired normal bioptic specimens were screened for comparative proteomic approach by using 2D difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differential spots found with Decyder were identified by MALDI-TOF and peptide fingerprinting with Mascot search engine. Interactions among identified proteins was analyzed with STRING 9.1 search tool. Pathological TRG was assessed on surgical specimens. Results: A total of 30 proteins were identified as discriminators between tumour samples and controls by principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering (p < 0.01; spot map>50 %). These proteins were already described as involved in rectal metabolic cell pathways and angiogenesis. Possible correlations between these proteins and TRG are under evaluation. Conclusion: Comparative proteomics approach based on 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF identification succeeded in differentiating rectal tumour samples from paired normal rectal mucosa. Further analyses will unravel possible correlations between distinct protein profiles and TRG response to CRT treatment that could be used to select optimal therapy in rectal cancer patients. Objective: Eukrayotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) are important for induction of gene expression, wherefore they play a critical role in cellular activity. eIFs are involved in cancer formation, progression and thus prognosis. Endometrial carcinoma (EC) belongs to the most common gynaecologic malignancies. According to the aetiopathogenesis, type I and type II EC can be disdinguished. Method: Tissue samples from 297 female EC patients and control samples from nine subjects with normal endometrium were included into the study. Each sample was tested for seven different eIF-subunits (eIF 2alpha, 3p110, 3h, 4e, 4g, 5, 6) . Results: High expression levels of eIF4g in tissue samples with a low expression were significantly associated with reduced overallsurvival (p < 0.05). For eIF2alpha, 3p110, 3h, 4e, 5 and 6, however, no significant results emerged. Nevertheless, a trend towards reduced overall-survival with particular expression alterations was present. Conclusion: According to these results, one eIF was significantly associated with short overall-survival in patients suffering from EC. Though expression levels of the remaining eIF-subunits showed a trend towards reduced overall-survival, no significant results could be archived. eIFs may constitute markers prediciting outcome in EC, though further investigations will be needed in order to strengthen the clinically useful readout. Objective: KRAS oncogene shows different mutation distribution in different malignancies. The purpose of this work was to determine the relative contribution of mutational biases and natural selection to the distribution of KRAS mutations in colon, lung and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Method: Distribution of KRAS mutation subtypes was determined using the Catalog Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer. Data of synonymous mutations from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to determine mutational biases. Normalization of actual mutation subtype to expected base pair change determined the selective power of each mutation. The clinical significance of positively selected mutations was evaluated in 100 lung adenocarcinoma cases. Results: KRAS mutation subtype distribution was significantly different between the tumour types with c.35G>A presenting 35, 17 and 51 % of KRAS mutations in colon, lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, respectively (p < 0.0001). Following normalization to the TCGA data, p.G12V and p.G12C were the most positively selected mutations in colon and lung adenocarcinomas, respectively. In our lung adenocarcinoma data set the evolutionary selected mutations were associated with higher tumour stage and grade. Conclusion: Analysis of the expected and actual distribution of mutation subtypes can determine the relative selective strength of different mutations in each tumour type and may provide higher resolution for personalized anti-cancer therapy. Objective: ALK testing to identify patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung likely to benefit from crizotinib therapy is now standard practice. However, the prevalence of ALK translocation in NSCLC with squamous differentiation has not been well characterized in the published literature. Method: This series included 3317 cytology, biopsy and resection specimens referred to our service from over 20 UK hospitals for ALK testing. Parallel fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH; Vysis Abbott break apart probes) and immunohistochemistry (IHC; Ventana D5F3 antibodies) was performed for each case. Results: Although the majority of cases were adenocarcinomas, 56 squamous cell and 48 adenosquamous carcinomas were successfully tested with FISH and IHC. Of these 10 were FISH+ (9.6 %), significantly higher than the overall series rate of 3.2 % (p = 0.005). The proportion of FISH+/ IHC-squamous tumours with significantly greater than the proportion of discrepant adenocarcinomas (70 and 23 % respectively, p = 0.004). Conclusion: Contrary to conventional wisdom this large series shows that ALK gene rearrangements may be seen in NSCLC with squamous differentiation. We plan to investigate the high rate of FISH+/IHC-discordance using RT-PCR. Data for response to crizotinib is being collected to determine the clinical significance of ALK translocation in this subset of patients. Objective: In addition to testing for KIT and PDGFRA mutations, which are found in most GISTs, we have recently incorporated SDH and BRAF testing for wild type GISTs into our routine service.",

From 2013 wild type GISTs were also tested for BRAF mutation (real time PCR) and SDHB/A deficiency (immunohistochemistry). Results: Of the 1200 successfully tested cases 73.9 % showed KIT mutations, of which exon 11 deletion was most frequent, and 11.0 % showed PDGFRA mutations, of which exon 18 D842V missense mutation was most frequent (see table for full spectrum). Wild type GISTs accounted for 15.1 % of cases. Five of the 35 cases tested for SDH showed a deficiency and these patients are now under investigation for germline testing. One codon 600 BRAF mutation has so far been detected. Conclusion: This large series demonstrates the feasibility of multiple molecular testing and integrated reporting by a single laboratory. The relatively high proportion of SDH deficiency detected so far highlights the importance of routine SDH immunohistochemistry for wild type GISTs.",

Cytology sampling is less invasive and preferred modality in inoperable patients. The objectives are to assess the utility and adequacy of cytology specimens to determine ALK gene-arrangement status by immunohistochemistry and FISH assay. Method: At our institution after rapid onsite evaluation when possible at least 2 additional passes are dedicated to cell block preparation. Pathology information system search from January 2013 to March 2015 identified 574 cytology samples from 554 patients screened for ALK generearrangement by immunohistochemistry using 5A4 antibody. Positive cases were tested with FISH assay for confirmation using Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit (ABBOTT Labs). Results: 19 cases (age range 38-81 years, sex 11 F: 8 M) were 2+ or 3+ positive by IHC and another 5 cases were very faintly positive. The average number of tumour cells present in the cell block was 500 in these cases. Seven case samples were from metastasis and 12 were from primary lung tumours. All 2+ and 3+ IHC positive samples were confirmed positive with Break Apart FISH assay but all faintly IHC positive cases were negative by FISH assay. The overall FISH confirmed ALK positive rate was 3.4 % in screened cytology cases which is within the expected range of ALK positive cases. Conclusion: Less invasive cytology samples are an excellent source for ALK gene-rearrangement testing when optimized fine needle protocols are used to procure and process adequate specimens.",

We aimed to investigate the significance of PC in a large series of consecutive primary melanomas (PM) and loco-regional lymph nodes (LN). Method: We revised 710 melanomas to correlate the presence of PC with histological prognostic markers. Immunohistochemistry for CD138, heavy and light chains was done in PM and LN. In 3 PM and in 9 LN with frozen material, VDJ-rearrangement was analyzed by Gene Scan Analysis. Results: 41 cases (5 %) showed clusters/sheets of PC. PC-rich melanomas occurred at an older age and were thicker, more often ulcerated and more mitotically active (p < 0.05). PC were polyclonal and often expressed IgA in addition to IgG. In LN, IgA+ PC were found both in the sinuses and subcapsular areas. The number of IgA+ PC was higher in involved than in non-involved LN. Analysis of VDJ-rearrangements showed the IgA to be oligoclonal. Conclusion: Sheets of PC in melanoma are associated with poor prognostic features. IgA oligoclonality suggests an antigen-driven response that facilitates melanoma progression by a hitherto unknown mechanism.",

One percent of all lymphomas and approximately 8 % of all extranodal lymphomas arise in the OA and the incidence is increasing. The different OA structures show a distinctly different disease spectrum. The objective is to gain insight into the relative frequencies of the types and location of OA lymphoid disease through a single center review. Method: The diagnoses and location of 226 lymphoproliferative lesions from the past 27 years in the department of Pathology of the Erasmus University Medical center were evaluated. Results: The relative frequencies of ocular adnexal lymphoma presentation are orbit, 38 %, conjunctiva, 31 %, lacrimal apparatus, 18 % and eyelid, 13 %. The most frequent primary lymphoma types of the ocular adnexa are extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, 63 %, follicular lymphoma, 16 %, diffuse large B cell lymphoma 10 %. The eyelids show the highest proportion of secondary lymphoma involvement, 47 % of all eyelid lymphoproliferative lesions, compared with 20 % in the other ocular adnexa. This probably also explains the most varied list of 12 different diagnostic entities in the eyelid, including T-cell lymphoma. Conclusion: The eyelid lymphoid lesions are clearly distinct from the other ocular adnexa. Table: OFP-17-003 A case of epidermotropic and folliculotropic T-cell lymphocytosis: Drug-induced Mycosis-like reaction or pilotropic T-cell dyscrasia? M. Rassy * , G. Abadjian * Saint Joseph University, Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Beirut, Lebanon Wednesday, 9 September 2015, 14.00 -16 .00, Meeting Room 6/I OFP-17 Joint Oral Free Paper Session Dermatopathology / Ophthalmic Pathology Method: A 31-year-old white female patient presented with a generalized maculopapular pruritic rash, 2 weeks after the onset of a Lamotrigin treatment. She also presented with multiple adenopathies, blood eosinophilia and hyponatremia. The clinical differential diagnosis included Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Mycosis Fungo\u00efdes. A biopsy from the right forearm was performed. Results: On microscopic examination, the epidermis showed orthokeratosis, perifollicular parakeratosis and rare epidermal acidophilic bodies. A basal linear exocytosis of lymphocytes, with perinuclear clear halo, was noted, some mimicking small Lutzner cells. The lymphocytes were mostly concentrated at a follicular infundibulum, or scattered in the superficial dermis with scarce neutrophils. They were CD3, CD4 and CD8 positive (CD4/CD8 ratio estimated at 2) and CD7 negative. Alcian Blue stain showed no mucinosis. A descriptive diagnosis of folliculotropic T-cell lymphocytosis was hence made; Drug-induced Mycosis-like reaction could not be excluded. Lamotrigin was discontinued. The complete resolution of her symptoms and the disease-free 6-month follow-up confirmed the DRES S syndrome and the non-neoplastic nature of the cutaneous infiltrate. Conclusion: Folliculotropic T-cell lymphocytosis within a DRESS syndrome can mimick Mycosis Fungo\u00efdes. Drug-related lymphoid cutaneous reactions remain extremely controversial when considered in the absence of the clinical information and evolution.",

We identified five cases in our database diagnosed between 2005 and 2014. These are worth reporting due to their variety of histological features that may lead to misinterpretations in differential diagnosis. Results: In first two cases, an exophytic dermal nodule surrounded by an epidermal collarette was observed. The main component was polygonal epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a chondromyxoid stroma. Case 3 was composed of a lesion with prominent hemangiopericytoma-like pattern characterized by numerous small vascular structures scattered between epitheloid cells. In case 4, the striking histopathological feature was the extensive mucin deposition surrounding spindle, epithelioid, and rare xanthomatous cells. In the last one, spitzoid cellular morphology and stromal hypereosinophilic collagen bundles were the striking features. All lesions were immunohistochemically positivite for FactorXIIIa and CD68. Dermal melanocytic lesions were excluded based on negativity of melanocytic markers. Conclusion: The light microscopic findings of ECH can mimic melanocytic, vascular, epithelial, or other histiocytic lesions. Combination of histological and immunophenotypic findings is crucial for proper diagnosis. It is important for practicing pathologists to be aware of this entity and its various histological patterns.",

Tsioltas * Theagenion Anticancer Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Thessaloniki, Greece Objective: Loss of E-cadherin expression has been associated with malignant progression of neoplastic cells through loss of cell-cell contact and thereby allowing cancer cells to detach and migrate. It is observed from in early stage and radial growth phase melanoma in metastatic melanoma in a percentage higher than 80 %. Method: We studied 20 patients (11 females, 9 males) with regional lymph node metastatic melanoma (primary melanomas: Nodular and Superficial Spreading Melanoma), within a range of age between 41 and 83 years old. In our study we evaluated the immunohistochemically E -cadherin expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue in metastatic melanoma cells of lymph nodes. Results: Expression of E -cadherin in 100 % melanoma cells. The expression was complete membranous, strong in a percentage of 60 % (12 patients) and moderate in a percentage of 40 % (8 patients). Conclusion: Even though there is loss of E -cadherin expression in the majority of similar studied cases in the literature, in our study E -cadherin was expressed in a percentage of 100 %. Objective: Keratoacanthoma (KA) is a common benign keratinocytic skin neoplasm that is located to sun exposed areas. It typically develops rapidly and undergoes complete spontaneous regression. P53 induces apoptosis and may be related to regression of KAs. We wanted to study P53 expression through stages of KA development-during proliferation, maturation and regression. Method: 124 KAs were characterized with respect to age of the lesions, in addition to phenotypic criteria such as cellular atypia, infiltration and fibrosis. Tp53 mutations were detected by capillary electrophoresis and P53 protein levels assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Tp53 mutations were detected in 49/124 cases (39.5 %). Increased levels of p53 protein were correlated with Tp53 gene mutation. A significant correlation was seen between high p53 protein levels and cellular atypia, infiltration and age of the lesions. Conclusion: This is the first report showing extensive mutation of the Tp53 gene in KAs, and its association to increased p53 levels. Higher p53 protein levels in older lesions suggest a role for p53 in the late stage of keratoacanthomas, suggesting a p53-dependent apoptosis pathway related to regression. This is further substantiated by the significance restricted to non-mutated lesions.",

Results: Among 6657 BCCs, there were two with microscopically proven metastases (0.03 %). A 68-years old male, with the history of scalp irradiation (for tinea capitis treatment) at the age of 12, developed metastases in multiple bones, and infiltrative BCC was found in sacrum biopsy. He had first basal cell carcinoma discovered at the age of 58, and experienced 22 excisions during the 8-years-period for recurrent BCC located in the occipital and parietal region. Tumour diameter-range was 6-102 mm (average 36.3 mm, median 31.5 mm). First seven biopsies showed tumour in the reticular dermis, while most of the remaining tumours invade subcutaneous fat, muscles, epicranial aponeurosis or parietal bone. All scalp tumours were infiltrative or morpheaform histologic type. Second patient was an 82-yearold male with BCC on the ear lobe and metastasis in retroauricular lymph node. Tumour was 35 mm in diameter, infiltrative type. Conclusion: Location, multiple recurrences, infiltrative type and exposure to ionizing radiation could be associated with (albeit small) risk of metastatic BCC.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether this could also be true for the investigation of scar tissue. Method: 32 routine histological preparations of keloids, hypertrophic and normal scars were studied. Two-photon fluorescence and SHG was obtained by a multiphoton microscope and a Mai Tai Ti-Saphire laser at 940 nm. 3D reconstructed patchwork images were created and computerized image analysis was done. For FLIM we used a system composed of a confocal microscope and a FLIM detection system. The samples were excited by a laser diode at 405 nm. Results: Texture variables derived from the co-occurrence matrix of the computerized fluorescence images showed significant differences between normal scars, hypertrophic scars and keloids. Lifetimes of collagen in central areas of all scar types were significantly longer than in the periphery. There was a significant positive correlation between the fluorescence lifetimes of red blood cells and collagen fibers among the cases. Conclusion: In summary, SHG and FLIM techniques reveal in routinely processed scar tissue morphological characteristics, which cannot be detected by conventional light microscopy.",

Shousha * , N. Ali * Charing Cross Hospital, Dept. of Histopathology, London, United Kingdom Objective: WT1 is expressed in around 60 % of invasive mucinous carcinoma of the breast, and, as previously shown, in around 80 % of mucocelelike lesions. We extended our study by investigating WT1 expression in simple mucinous cysts, presumably precursors of mucocele-like lesions, and mucinous DCIS, presumably precursors of invasive mucinous carcinoma, to see if there is a continuum of WT1 positive breast lesions. Method: The study included 34 mucocele like lesions, many also containing simple mucinous cysts, 4 mucinous DCIS and 10 benign nonmucinous lesions. Sections were stained for WT1 using immunohistochemistry, and for mucin using alcian blue/ PAS. Results: Thirty one (91 %) out of 34 mucocele like lesions were WT1 positive. WT1 was also expressed in all mucinous cysts containing acidic mucin and in all 4 mucinous DCIS. WT1 was not expressed in nonmucinous cysts, ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell change, flat epithelial atypia, fibroadenomas or in lactational change. However, WT1 was noted in a rare normal looking or mildly hyperplastic duct. Conclusion: WT1 is expressed in a continuum of breast lesions extending from an occasional normal-looking duct to simple mucous cysts, mucocele like lesions, mucinous DCIS and invasive mucinous carcinoma, this may help in understanding the pathogenesis of mucinous carcinoma. Objective: The objective of this study is to determine whether the current internal quality assurance program for HR (ER, PR and Her2) testing of breast cancer can be refined by incorporating clinic-pathologic factors such as tumour grade. Method: All breast cancer patients (n = 662) tested for HR in Newfoundland during the first 6 months of recommencing testing at Eastern Health IHC laboratory (post Cameron inquiry) were included. Data on age at diagnosis, tumour type, stage, and grade, lymph node status, fixation time, Allred score, and HR status (ER, PR, and Her2) were collected. Results: 80.2, 69.9 and 15.9 % of breast cancers were ER, PR and Her2 positive. Only 18/189 (9.5 %) of grade 1 and 2 cancers were ER-/PR-. Of the Her2 positive cancers, 6.2 % (3/48) were grade 1 and 52.1 % (25/48) were grade 2 cancers, respectively. A significant statistical association between high-grade tumours and negative ER and PR immunostains was found (P < 0.0001). Positive Her2 immunostains were also associated with high-grade tumours (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Including pertinent clinic-pathologic information into an IHC Internal Quality Assurance Program Testing in breast cancers is both feasible and important. Our findings show that incorporating tumour grade enhances identification of erroneous breast marker results.",

Method: In this retrospective study (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) , 192 breast cancer patients have been evaluated. All of the patients underwent surgical treatment based on previously diagnosed breast cancer. The morphological and histopathological examination of the surgical specimen have determined the assessment of the NPI and the additional immunohistochemical analyzes were used in order to separate four molecular subtypes of breast cancer: Luminal A and B, HER2+ and Triple-. Results: The age of the patients was 28-83 years (mean 50,24 years). The NPI was higher in Luminal B (80 patients, 41,7 %), HER2+ (36 patients, 18,7 %) and triple negative BCs (25 patients, 13 %) compared with Luminal A BCs (51 patients, 26, 6 %, p < 0, 01) . The tumour size (pT) was bigger in HER2+ and Triple-BCs compared with the tumour size of Luminal A BCs (p < 0, 05) . Histologic grade (G) was positively associated among Luminal A and other less differentiated subtypes (p < 0,01) while the lymphonodal metastases were usually present in Luminal B and HER2+ BCs compared with Luminal A (p < 0,01) and in HER2+ BCs, compared with triple-BCs (p < 0,05). Conclusion: This study provides well evidence for the use of NPI supporting the individual treatment management on four different subtypes of BCs. Objective: The demonstration of myoepithelium plays an important role in the distinction between benign, preinvasive and invasive malignant mammary lesions. Certain types of breast lesions show occasional lack or reduction of staining for myoepithelial markers. In this study, we analyzed such entities for the expression of a novel marker, p40, and correlated this to the p63 staining profile. Method: P40 and p63 immunostaining was analyzed in a selected set of benign sclerosing and (11) adenomyoepithelial lesions (10), high grade Sunday, 6 September 2015, 09.30-10.30 , Restaurant PS-01 Poster Session Breast Pathology ductal carcinomas in situ (15), cytokeratin 5-positive, estrogen receptornegative invasive carcinomas (20) and associated normal breast tissues. Results: Normal structures showed analogous positivity using p40 and p63 (diffuse and strong) in 35/35 cases. Both antibodies gave a similar labeling in 38/38 lesions reported to show altered expression of myoepithelial markers; they demonstrated losses of staining focally in a parallel manner. The expression of p40 was seen more frequently (18/19) than that of p63 (8/19) in the tumour cells of cytokeratin 5-positive carcinomas and the staining was also more marked. Conclusion: Our data support that the two antibodies can be used alternately for the demonstration of the myoepithelium, but there seems to be a difference in the labeling of at least a subset of tumour cells. Objective: Breast cancer is frequently diagnosed worldwide. Histamine acts as mediator in several cancers. Ketotifen is a mast cells stabilizer drug that inhibits their degranulation. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of histamine on the development of MNU-induced mammary tumours. Method: Procedures followed the European Directive 2010/63/EU. Twenty animals were equally divided into two experimental groups: ketotifen and control. At 7 weeks of age, all animals received an intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Animals from ketotifen group received ketotifen in drinking water (1 mg/Kg; 7 days/ week; for 18 weeks). At the sacrifice, mammary tumours were fixed and histologically evaluated. Results: During the protocol one ketotifen-treated animal died. At the end, eight animals from ketotifen group developed 19 mammary tumours (2.4 tumours per animal), while six animals from control group developed 21 mammary tumours (3.5 tumours per animal). Animals from control group developed one benign lesion and 20 non-invasive carcinoma; all lesions from ketotifen-treated animals were malignant, however they did not develop any comedo carcinoma that was the lesion of the highest grade of malignancy found in this work. Conclusion: Inhibition of histamine release by ketotifen seems to reduce the number and malignancy of MNU-induced mammary tumours. Objective: Estrogen receptors (ERs)-\u03b1 and \u03b2 are important for stimulating the growth and differentiation of human mammary tumours, respectively. This work aimed to evaluate the expression of ERs-\u03b1 and \u03b2 in rat chemically-induced mammary tumours. Method: Procedures followed the European legislation (2010/63/EU). Fifteen seven-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats received an intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) (50 mg/Kg). At sacrifice, mammary tumours were fixed and histologically evaluated. Sections were incubated with ER-\u03b1 and \u03b2 primary antibodies and the percentage of immunopositive cells was determined. Results: During the experimental protocol four animals died, all survived animals developed mammary tumours: 30 benign, 2 preneoplastic and 39 malignant lesions. All histological patterns expressed ERs-\u03b1 and \u03b2. The mean expression of ER-\u03b1 (55. 14 % \u00b1 13.26 ) was lower than the expression of ER-\u03b2 (70.06 % \u00b1 18.51) (p < 0.05). The expression of both receptors was not statistically different among lesions, however it was higher in preneoplastic lesions, followed by malignant and benign ones (p>0.05). Conclusion: All MNU-induced mammary tumours in rats expressed ERs-\u03b1 and \u03b2, being a good model of ER-positive human mammary tumours. Once the expression of ER-\u03b2 was higher, tumours' differentiation was stimulated and its proliferation was inhibited. Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short assembly of non-coding, single-stranded RNAs, which are important gene regulators acting on cellular functions. Deregulation of miRNA has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer. There are some miRNAs known as oncogenes or tumour suppressors in breast cancer. We analyzed miRNA profiles of phyllodes tumours (PT) and fibroadenoma (FA) cases. Method: miRNA microarray analysis was performed on 13 PT cases (3 malignant, 3 borderline, 7 benign) and 7 FA cases by using the FFPE samples. A total of 400 ng RNA from each sample was used and labeled with PANArray\u2122 miRNA expression profiling kit (PANAGENE Inc). The kit is a PNA-based microarray for expression profiling of 158 miRNAs. Hybridization images were captured by the GenePix4000B scanner. The expression level ratio of 1.5 or more was considered as overexpressed and 0.5 or less as underexpressed. Results: Among 158 cancer and stem cell-related miRNAs, miR-155 (1.68fold) and miR-200c (1.61-fold) were overexpressed in the borderline and malignant PT groups compared with the benign PT and FA groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Even though there was no significant difference in miRNA expression among PT and FA cases, both miR-155 and miR-200c were upregulated in high grade (borderline and malignant) PT cases.",

Method: We analyzed PTEN alteration in a tissue microarray format containing more than 1000 primary breast cancers with clinical follow up data. Tissue Microarray sections were analyzed for protein expression and copy number change using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Loss of PTEN immunostaining was observed in 77 % of the cases. PTEN loss was significantly associated with large tumour size (p = 0.0030), high grade (p = 0.0281), tumour recurrence (p = 0.0333) and Triple negative breast cancers (p = 0.0086). PTEN loss in Triple negative breast cancers was significantly associated with rapid tumour cell proliferation (p = 0.0396) and poor prognosis (p = 0.0408). PTEN deletion was found only in 60 cases (6.4 %) of cases. Conclusion: Loss of PTEN protein expression occurs at high frequency in Middle Eastern breast cancer. PTEN inactivation may potentially lead to an aggressive behavior of tumour cells through stimulation of tumour cell proliferation.",

Poulsen * Hospital of Southern Jutland, Dept. of Pathology, Sonderborg, Denmark Objective: Myofibroblastoma of the breast is a benign mesenchymal neoplasm that occur more commonly in older men with gynaecomastia and postmenopausal women. Method: We report a case of a 54 years old woman, with 12 mm right palpable nodule. Results: After core biopsy that showed stroma with infiltration of tumour cells, positive for estrogens but negative for cytokeratins, lumpectomy was performed. Macroscopic examination of the specimen showed a solid, well circumscribed pseudo-encapsulated tumour. Microscopically in H&E the tumour was cellular composed of bipolar spindle cell with oval nuclei which were arranged in fascicles intermingled with bundles of collagen. There were also entrapped adipocytes of variable size, without epithelial elements within lesion. There were no areas of necrosis. Tumour cells were positive for vimentin, estrogens and Bcl-2, focal positive for desmin and negative for CD 34. Cytokeratins, S-100 and smooth muscle actin were negative. Ki-67 was positive in <2 %. Diagnosis of myofibroblastoma was given after correlating histopathological and immuno-histochemical findings. Conclusion: The diagnosis of MFB is difficult in needle core biopsy, especially if one is faced with unusual variants that could be misdiagnosed as malignant. The correlation of histology and immunohistochemistry is helpful to establish the diagnosis of MFB. Objective: We report a case of radiation-induced angiosarcoma of breast, developed 10 years after primary breast high grade DCIS, treated with quadrantectomy, Tamoxifen and radiotheraphy, in a 64-year-old female. Method: We describe the clinical presentation and comment on the histologic diagnosis and the therapeutic approach. Results: The patient presented with a reddish thickening of the periareolar skin of the left breast, measuring 10 \u00d7 6 cm. In 2004, she was diagnosed with a high grade DICS (DIN3), hormone respons i ve w i t h H E R -2 ne g a t i v i t y ; s h e u n d e r w e n t m a m m a r y quadrantectomy, and was administered Tamoxifen and radiotheraphy. A skin biopsy was performed, revealing a poorly differentiated vascular proliferation. The patient underwent a mastectomy with dermoepidermal graft. Histologically the neoplastic population consisted of highly atypical hobnail and spindle cells, with high mitotic index (24mitoses/10HPF). Extensive necrosis and areas of hemorrhage were evident. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for vimentin, CD31 and CD34; Mib1 labeled 80 % of the neoplastic elements. FISH analysis documenting C-MYC amplification supported the diagnosis of radiation-induced angiosarcoma. 10 months later, the patient is disease-free. Conclusion: This report confirms that secondary radiation-induced angiosarcoma is often associated with MYC amplification, documenting its diagnostic relevance. Mastectomy seems to be the best treatment option.",

Ilic Sabo, L. Vuckovic-Hardi, I. Jelicic * Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Center for Pathology, Novi Sad, Serbia Objective: We evaluated the concordance of hormone receptors (estrogen-ER and progesterone-PR), HER2 status and Ki67 expression between core needle biopsy (CNB) and surgical specimens (SS). Method: ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 expression were determinated by immunohistochemistry on preoperative CNB and subsequent SS in 54 patients with invasive breast cancer with no chemotherapy between. All patients were treated at the Institute of Oncology of Vojvodina for both of procedures. Cutoff value for Ki67 high expression was 14 %. The analysis of the concordance was performed using the kappa (k) coefficient (95 %CI). Results: Concordance rates for ER, PR and HER2 were 96,4, 90,7 and 94,5 % respectively. Ki67 expression was slightly higher in CNB than in SS samples (61,1 vs. 44,4 %) . An almost perfect concordance was identified for ER (k = 0, 88; 95 %CI: 0, 0) and also for HER2 (k = 0,81; 95 %CI: 0,60-1,0). There was a substantial concordance for PR (k = 0, 75; 95 %CI: 0, 96) , while for Ki67 moderate concordance was registered (k = 0, 46; 95 %CI: 0, 68 Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of tru-cut biopsy (TCB) in the diagnosis of breast lesions. Method: This retrospective observational non-interventional study included 169 patients in whom TCB was performed for the diagnosis of a breast lesion between 2010 and 2014 in the Surgery Department. Results: All the TCB were optimal for microscopic evaluation. Histopathology revealed 115 (68 %) malignant lesions, 45 (27 %) benign lesions and 9 (5 %) suspicious lesions. One hundred percent of malignant and precursor lesions (including in ductal situ carcinoma, lobular neoplasia and suspicious lesions) were followed by surgical procedures (mastectomy/wide local excision), and only 14 out of 45 benign lesions (31 %) were followed by surgical procedures. Based on the histopathological diagnosis on TCB, there were 115 (68 %) true-positive cases, 22 (13 %) true-negative cases, 1 (0,6 %) false-positive case and no false-negative cases. TCB exhibited a sensitivity of 99 %, specificity of 96 %, a positive predictive value of 99 %, a negative predictive value of 100 % and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 99 %. Conclusion: TCB is an accurate, reliable and safe method of establishing the diagnosis in breast lesions; it also provides all the necessary details to guide the clinician in designing an optimal therapeutic strategy for patients with breast lesions. Objective: CD31 is an adhesion molecule expressed by endothelial cells, leukocytes and platelets. Its expression by non-endothelial neoplastic cells has been correlated with \"vascular mimicry\" (VM), a phenomenon where neoplastic cells form tubular channels mimicking endothelial cells. VM is more pronounced in more aggressive tumours. The HER2/neu gene is amplified in 20-30 % of breast carcinomas, and has been correlated with features of aggressive clinical course. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of CD31 in high-grade HER2+ breast carcinomas.",

The DCIS component was of high nuclear grade. In one of the cases where the invasive carcinoma was negative, the adjacent DCIS was focally positive with strong immunostaining. Conclusion: The expression of CD31 by neoplastic cells in breast carcinomas is not frequent and is not correlated with VM. It is possibly correlated with the \"plasticity\" of cancer cells, which exhibit simultaneously various immunophenotypes from epithelial to mesenchymal, including endothelial.",

FEA is at the center of scientific interest as a frequent early lesion in the low grade breast carcinoma pathological pathway which is of clinical significance as a precursor to cancer of the mammary gland. Method: We examined 76 retrospective samples of low grade invasive carcinoma and tubular carcinoma from the archives of the CGB Laboratory. We observed the presence of different types of CCL and two types of microcalcifications in the biopsy materi\u00e1l -ossificans and crystalline type. We performed immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to cyclin D1 and Bcl2 in 20 cases. (10 cases of FEA and 10 cases of CCL without atypia). Results: The coexistence of different CCL and low grade invasive carcinoma was statistically significant. Expression of Bcl2 and cyclin D1 had no specific statistical relationship with FEA and CCL without atypia. Conclusion: Our finding is consistent with and confirms the theory of the low grade estrogen dependent carcinoma pathway. Measurement of BCL2 expression and cyclin D1 in order to distinguish between FEA and CCL without atypia however proves to make no contribution.",

            "text": "An unusual type of primary breast lymphoma A. V. Dumitru * , M. Popa, M. Costache, M. Sajin * Emergency University Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, Romania Objective: Primary breast lymphoma is a rare entity, counting for less than 2.2 % of extranodal lymphomas and less than 0.5 % of breast malignancies. More than 70 % of them are of B-cell lineage. Primary Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast is even rarer. Method: A 54-year-old woman with two nodular, solid, painful left breast lesions was referred to the Emergency University Hospital Bucharest. Clinical examination revealed inflammation and ulceration of the overlying skin along with axillary erithema and enlarged axillary lymph nodes.The aspect was suggestive for inflammatory breast cancer.A core biopsy was performed, but proved to be inconclusiv, although it could not exclude a malignancy.Based on these findings the patient received anti-inflammatory medication and 2 weekslater she was scheduled for lumpectomy with axillary lymphadenectomy. Results: Microscopic examination showed a nodular lymphoid malignant proliferation that infiltrates the adjacent mammary tissue. A proliferation of eosinophiles, plasma cells, giant pleomorphic lacunar Reed-Sternberg cells, Hodgkin cells and anaplastic multinucleated giant cells were observed to replace the normal architecture of the breast. Imunohistochemical investigantions (CD30, Pax5, CD15, CD20, CD3) were consistent with classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. Conclusion: This report presents a curious case of primary breast lymphoma that clinically posed as an inflammatory breast cancer. Further immunohistochemistry investigations guided the diagnosis of primary Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast. Objective: Identification of cancer-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is pivotal in understanding molecular mechanisms implicated in carcinogenesis. MALAT1 is an abundant lncRNA with regulatory and structural functions (nuclear speckles). MALAT1 mutations and dysregulation have been recently observed in carcinomas. However, its role in breast cancer is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the expression pattern of MALAT1 and to evaluate its biological role and clinical significance in invasive breast carcinomas (IBC). Method: We performed RT-PCR, RNA-FISH and RPPA methods to quantify transcript and/or protein levels of the wild type MALAT1 gene, two major alternatively spliced MALAT1 variants and candidate genes involved in MALAT1 functions in IBCs. Results: Wild type MALAT1 was overexpressed in 17 % of IBCs and significantly correlated with high histopathological grade and positive hormone receptors. Two major alternatively spliced MALAT1 pre-mRNAs were underexpressed respectively in 18 and 22 % of IBCs. Survival analysis revealed that patients with low alternatively spliced MALAT1 had shorter MFS. Conclusion: We identified in IBCs a complex expression pattern of MALAT1 wild type and variants transcripts indicative of nuclear speckles disruption and associated with shorter MFS. Objective: Secretory carcinoma of the breast is an extremely rare neoplasm (<1 %) which shows distinct features at cytology and histology. It is still rarer in adults where it is potentially more aggressive than in childhood. Recent researchs showed that secretory carcinoma belongs to the phenotypic spectrum of basal-like breast carcinomas. Diagnosis of this carcinoma at fine needle aspiration cytology is difficult. Method: A 55 years old woman with a breast mass underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy. Results: The aspirate was highly cellular and consisted of sheets, clusters and single cells with abundant cytoplasm and intracytoplasmic vacuoles in a background of mucinous and eocinophilic globules of secretory material. Some of the cells were binucleated or multinucleated and showed emperipolesis. Histopathologic examination of the mass showed a tumour with solid, microcystic and ductal patern associated with PAS positive diastase resistant intracellular and extracellular abundant secretory material. Immunohistochemically, tumour was negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, positive for CK5/6 and EGFR. Conclusion: The authors were discussed the differences in morphology at fine needle aspiration cytology of secretory carcinoma of the breast from other breast carcinomas, correlation with histopathology and its utility of making a preoperative diagnosis.",

Method: 393 postoperative invasive ductal breast carcinoma materials investigated in 2008-2012 were used for the study. Association of CD44/CD24 expression in different tumour phenotypes, between clinicpathological parameters and different biological characteristics were performed. Pearson correlation and \u03c72 tests were used for quantitative analysis. Results: Amount of CD44 positive cases progressively increased with tutor grade (p < 0.001). Expression of CD44 regularly reflected aggressive behavior and metastatic potential of cancer subtypes, except Her2 + subtype (p < 0.001). CD 24 as an independent marker does not reflect a clear correlation between aggressive behavior and metastatic potential of tumours (p = 0.01). Stem cells phenotype (CD44+/CD24-low) positivity was in direct correlation with tumour grade and metastatic potential, except Her2 + subtype (p < 0.001), also with tumour size (p < 0.001), presence of metastatic lymph nodes and high proliferative activity (Ki-67) (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Cells with CD44 +/CD24-low phenotype are involved in tumour progression and development of metastasis. CD44 alone can be used as an independent marker of tumour progression.",

Fountzilas, V. Kotoula * Aristole University Thessaloniki, Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Greece Objective: The monoclonal antibody pertuzumab inhibits signaling from HER2 heterodimers and is currently used in the treatment of breast cancer (BC). Herstatin (p68-HER2 protein) is produced through alternative splicing of the HER2 gene and acts as an endogenous HER inhibitor similar to pertuzumab. Herein, changes in the gene region encoding the carboxy-tail of herstatin, including intron 8, were investigated. Method: Informative data from 1612 paraffin BC DNA samples were obtained by using highly-multiplexed custom panels and massively parallel sequencing. Variant metrics and annotations were retrieved with the Ion Reporter v.4 software. Results: In total, 166 nucleotide variants were observed in exon-intron8 in 121 breast carcinomas (121/1612, 7.5 %) and were mostly (138/166, 83.1 %) located in the herstatin-tail intron8 region corresponding to 52 nucleotide positions. Variants were mostly C/T transitions (72/138, 52 %) . Moreover, in intron8 region of herstatin two different polymorphisms (rs139636338 and rs4252625) were observed. These changes were found more often in HER2 positive than negative carcinomas (Pearson p = 0.002). Conclusion: Nucleotide variations are observed in a subset of breast carcinomas in the HER2 gene region encoding Herstatin. It will be of interest to further investigate whether these changes affect the endogenous or pharmaceutical inhibition of the HER signaling pathway. Objective: The aim of the study is to assess the influence of the molecular profile of the primary breast tumour on the positivity of the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Method: A retrospective study was performed by accessing the molecular profile of 55 consecutive patients identified in the database between 2012 and 2014, diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma, in which SLN biopsy was performed for staging. The molecular profile included the assessment of the ER, PR, ki 67 and HER2 status in the invasive component (according to the St Gallen International Expert Consensus). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism, Fisher's exact test and Pearson's correlation tests. Results: Our 55 cases were imunohistochemically classified as: 24 Luminal A (43.64 %), 17 Luminal B-Her 2 negative (30.91 %), 6 Luminal B-Her2 positive (10.91 %), 1 as Her2 positive type (1.82 %) and 7 as triple negative (12. 73 %) . The statistical analysis revealed that ER (p = 0.66), PR (p = 0.26), ki 67 (p = 0.5), Her2 receptor (p = 0.41) and the molecular type of the primary tumour (p = 0.5) did not significantly influence the positivity of the SLN.

            "text": "A case of lobular breast carcinoma with extracellular mucin production E. Kavoura * , A. Nonni, P. Liakou, G. Zografos, E. Patsouris * Hippokratio Hospital Athens, Dept. of Cytology, Greece Abstract: Invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) of the breast typically demonstrate intracytoplasmic mucin, whereas extracellular mucin production is by default a feature of ductal origin carcinoma. We present a unique case of classical type ILC with focal extracellular mucin production. A 72-year-old woman presented with an ulcerated mass in the right breast. An ultrasound-guided needle core biopsy was performed. Histologically, sections showed architectural and cytological features of classical lobular carcinoma. Focally, a pool of extracellular mucin was detected, while neoplastic cells were floated within. Special stain for Alcian-Blue was used to confirm the mucin production. Immunohistochemical study for E-Cadherin showed complete loss of staining in all the neoplastic cells, including the cells within the mucin. Estrogen receptor (ER) showed 50 % (++/+++) positivity, whereas progesterone receptor (PR) was positive in less than 1 % of the tumour cells. HER2 was scored 1+ and Ki67 was counted 25 %. The findings suggest that the presence of extracellular mucin does not exclude a diagnosis of lobular carcinoma. To the best of the authors' knowledge, only 3 cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma displaying extracellular mucin have been reported in the literature. Results: The incidence of other primary malignant tumours (n = 234, including two male patients), occurring before the breast carcinoma was detected, increased from 3 to 7 % during 2007-2014. The most striking increase was found among the gynecological tumours (endometrium/ ovarian adenocarcinomas) and malignant melanoma. The number of lymphoma/leukemia cases, urothelial/renal cell carcinomas, head & neck region tumours, malignant soft tissue tumours did not show a significant increase, while thyroid gland carcinomas and lung cancer showed a slight increase. The number of gastrointestinal malignancies showed an irregular, but relatively high incidence during this time period. Conclusion: Second primary malignancies in breast cancer patients are becoming an issue of concern worldwide. Breast cancer patients with other primary malignancies need special treatment strategies, regarding the previously administered radio-and/or chemotherapy to avoid excessive cytotoxic harm due to cumulative effect of all applied therapies. Objective: Targeted therapy of breast cancer is based on results of immunohistochemical evaluation of Her2/neu status of primary tumour, but in some cases Her2/neu rate of metastases is dissimilar. The aim of this study is to evaluate and characterize difference of Her2/neu status between primary breast cancer and locoregional metastases. Method: Postoperative tissue samples of primary lesion and local metastases of breast carcinoma by 88 patients without neoadjuvant therapy before operation were included in this study. All tissue specimens were stained for Her2/neu by Ventana immunostainer. Patients were divided into four groups on the basis of the Her2/neu rate of the primary tumour: 1 -0 (50 cases), 2 -1+ (9 cases), 3 -2+ (17 cases), 4 -3+ (12 cases). In each group Her2/neu levels of primary and metastatic tumours were compared. Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean values of Her2/neu rate in metastases were: 0,33 in first, 0,85 in second, 0,75 in third and 2,13 in fourth group. Statistically significant (p < 0,01) was shift in third group only. Conclusion: The tendency to reduction of Her2/neu level in local metastases in patients with 2+-rate of primary cancer was revealed. In other groups there was no significant change of Her2/neu status in metastases.",

This feature is maximally expressed in medullary breast cancer, when membrane expression of E-cadherin is significantly decreased up to the absence. In infiltrating ductal carcinoma membrane expression of Ecadherin is detected in a large complexes of tumour cells and becomes cytoplasmic, or disappears in small groups of cells invading the stroma. Ultrastructural manifestations of EMT were homotypical. Separation of tumour cells was accompanied by the acquisition of fibroblast-like shape with invasion into the stroma, indicating their mesenchymal origin. In some cases of infiltrating breast carcinoma tumour cells expressed vimentin. Conclusion: The most characteristic feature of EMT in breast cancer is the presence of clusters of myofibroblasts in the stroma. EMT process is accompanied by the simultaneous expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. However, there is no fixed sequence of reducing the expression of epithelial markers and increasing the expression of mesenchymal ones.",

            "text": "Objective: Malignant mesenchymal tumours of the breast other than angiosarcoma are rare and comprise <0.5 % of breast tumours. Primary chondrosarcoma of the breast is an extremely rare entity and only less than 20 cases are reported as single case reports in literature until date. We present here a rare case of primary breast chondrosarcoma. Method: Case Report: A 50-year-old female patient presented to the surgical outpatient department complaining of a large lump in her left breast of 6 months duration. FNA cytology revealed malignant chondroid cells. The mass was removed with a wide local excision. Grossly, the tumour was received in multiple pieces together measuring 150 \u00d7 84 mm. Histological examination showed malignant chondroid and chondromyxoid proliferation. Further careful and detailed examination did not show any malignant epithelial components. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive vimentin and negative cytokeratin. A final diagnosis of chondrosarcoma of the breast was reached. Conclusion: Primary chondrosarcoma of the breast is an extremely rare condition. It's origin is obscure, and speculations abound. Misplaced mesenchymal nests, chondroid differentiation of tumours of mesenchymal origin, and pluripotent cells undergoing chondroblastic differentiation have been proposed. Extensive sectioning of the tumour and immunohistochemistry are essential to rule-out metaplastic carcinoma and malignant phyllodes tumour. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the intensity of apoptosis in tumours, removed surgically at various times after treatment, in patients after cisplatin. Sixteen cases of infiltrating ductal breast cancer in III stage of disease were studied. Method: The study used the method of transmission electron microscopy. Results: In each ultrathin slice the number of apoptosis in 30 tumour cells was counted. In tumours of patients who did not receive chemotherapy, and have undergone preoperative course or more than 2,5 months before, apoptosis occurred in individual fields of vision (0-3 %) . In patients treated with cisplatin for 1-2 months before surgery, apoptosis intensity was higher, and in 3 cases was 13-16 %. Conclusion: Intensity of cisplatin-induced apoptosis in breast cancer peaks at certain periods. The peak intensity of apoptosis is observed in 1-2 months after treatment. In some cases, activation of apoptosis, induced by cisplatin, appears on III stage of disease, and has no significant impact on life expectancy of patients. Objective: The goal of our research was to find dependence of prognostic marker expression (ER, PgR, HER-2/neu, \u044053, VEGF, \u041a\u0456-67, bcl-2) on age and on presence of metastases in mammary gland cancer, and to identify correlation in groups with metastases or without them. Method: To explore the dependence on age we compared general allocations based on intensity of a certain marker expression (nonmetering metastases) between a group <35 and 35-50 years old group, a group <35 and >50 years old, also between a 35-50 years old group and >50 years old. To analyze the difference in marker expression between subgroups with metastases and without them in every age group and difference between age group nonparametric test \u03c72(chi-squared) was used. Results: All markers with high confidence level can be used as prognostic regarding risk of development of metastases in patients of different age. Exeptional were ER and PgR markers in the age group <35 years old, ER -in 35-50 years old group. Increased level of expression with age was typical only for ER and PgR markers: for ER expression -difference was reliable in 35-50 years old group and >50 years old group, in groups <35 and >50 years old; for PgR -between 35 and 50 years old group and>50 years old group. Conclusion: It was discovered that expression of markers \u044053 and \u041a\u0456-67 reliably differs in groups with presence of metastases independent from age. The latter are more reliable as prognostic for younger than 35 years old group. Objective: Triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) is a subtype of breast carcinoma, with high invasiveness, aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Hormonal or HER-2 targeted therapies are ineffective for TNBCs, and conventional chemotherapy remains the main therapeutic option. The identification of new target therapeutic molecules could be helpful for these patients. Androgen receptor (AR) has been associated with triple negative breast cancer pathogenesis, but its role has not been clearly identified. The percentage of AR expression in TNBC varies in the literature, ranging from 25 to 75 %. Method: We have studied 24 cases of triple negative breast carcinomas in relation to their AR expression. The majority were ductal (NST) (17 cases, 4 of them with basal immunophenotype), 1 case of papillary, 3 cases of apocrine, 2 cases of medullary, and 1 case of mucinous carcinoma Results: In 10 (41.6 %) cases we detected intense nuclear positivity for AR, ranging from 5 to 99 % of neoplastic cells. Notably, the apocrine carcinomas showed the higher staining intensity and the higher percentage of positive cells. Also, nuclear AR expression was displayed in cells of normal ductal-lobular units. Conclusion: Our results suggest that AR positive carcinomas constitute an eventual subgroup of TNBCs which could possibly benefit from using AR as a therapeutic target.",

We report an unusual case of mixed type invasive breast carcinoma arising within fibroadenoma. Method: A 38-year-old woman with a palpable right breast mass, that was clinically and mammographically benign, underwent excision biopsy. Results: On gross pathology we identified a well-circumscribed, encapsulated nodule measuring 4,5 \u00d7 4,5 \u00d7 3 cm. The cut surface contained gelatinoid yellowish material and had focal cystic and solid areas of fibroelastic composition. On microscopic examination, we identified mixed type invasive breast cancer (with features of both invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) Grade III and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma) of 2 cm diameter arising within a fibroadenoma. By immunohistochemistry, tumour cells showed low estrogen receptor expression and were progesterone receptor positive. HER2 was 2+ by immunohistochemistry and negative by FISH. Ki-67 index was 60 %. tumour cells were positive for Ecadherin, with loss of it in the lobular areas. The patient underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy that was negative. Conclusion: Clinicians should be aware of this rare clinical entity. Special caution should be taken in patients older than 35 years presenting with fibroadenomas. Objective: Cancer stem cells are defined as small population of cancer cells with ability to differentiate, self renew and replicate the original tumour in vivo. The aim of the study is to evaluate the expression of CD44, CD24, CD133 and CD117 stem cell markers in different molecular subtypes. Method: Tissue samples from 28 cases of invasive breast cancers were divided into 4 major molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, Her2 enriched and triple negative), and correlated with immunohistochemical expression of stem cell markers and clinicopathological parameters. Results: Fourteen of the cases were classified as Luminal B, 9 were Luminal A, 4 were HER 2 and one was triple negative. Forty six percent of tumours were CD44+/CD24-, 18 % were CD133+, 14 % were CD117+ and 28 % were immunonegative for all 4 markers. Stem cell markers were expressed in 75 % of Her2 enriched 43 % of Luminal B and 37 % of Luminal A subtypes. They were also expressed in one triple negative case. Stem cell markers were correlated with larger tumour size (63 %), higher histologic grade (56 %), stage (87 %) and metastasis in lymph nodes (69 %). Conclusion: Cancer stem cells revealed varying expression in different molecular subtypes and may have certain significance in predicting prognosis in breast cancers. Objective: Over the past 3-4 decades, epidemiological data suggest an increasing incidence of breast cancer in young women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical, pathological and some molecular features of breast cancer in young women. Method: A retrospective study was performed in order to identify patients younger than 35 years diagnosed with breast cancer in a period of 2 years. We analyzed the clinico-pathological characteristics and the immunohistochemical profile of these tumours. Results: We have identified ten cases of breast tumours in women younger than 35 years: 9 primary carcinomas and 1 secondary tumour. The youngest patient was 19 years old. 5 carcinomas were larger than 2 cm and 3 tumours were poorly differentiated (G3). Axillary dissection was performed in five cases but nodal metastasis were identified in only 2 cases. One patient was diagnosed in our department with brain metastasis from breast carcinoma. Lymphovascular invasion was present in most cases, while perineural invasion was identified in only three cases. Most primary tumours were ER+/PR+ except one case which was ER-/PR-. HER2 protein was overexpressed in three cases. Conclusion: Breast cancer in young women seems an aggressive malignancy, being associated with adverse pathological factors and requiring adapted management strategies. Objective: To compare the clinicopathological features in breast cancer subtypes defined by immunohistochemistry expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesteron receptor (PR), Her2 and Ki-67. Method: We have retrospectively analyzed surgical specimens of 337 patients with invasive breast cancer. Subtypes of breast cancer were evaluated using conventional immunostaining: ER, PR, Her2 and Ki-67. Patients were classified into following groups: luminal A (ER/PR+, Her2-), luminal B (ER/PR+, Her2+), Her2+ (ER/PR-, Her2+) and triple-negative/basal-like (ER/PR-, Her2-). Results: 76.2 % carcinomas were classified as Luminal A, 10.4 % as Luminal B, 6.2 % as Her2 + and 5.4 % as triple-negative/basal-like subtype. Luminal A subtype was associated with G2 tumours, lobular type, T1 status and the lowest rate of regional lymph node involvement. Luminal B subtype correlated most common with G2 and T1 status, ductal type of carcinoma, but higher Ki-67 index and more frequent lymph node metastases. Her2+ and triple-negative/basal-like subtypes showed predominantly G3 and T2 status, other histological types than ductal and lobular and high regional lymph nodes involvement. Conclusion: The breast cancer classification on subtypes is very informative and it has predictive and prognostic value. Although further follow-up of these patients is needed, these facts are useful in identifying patients with increased risk of regional metastases and recurrence.",

The changes in statuses of HR, HER2 and Ki-67 in operated tumour tissue were compared with initial core biopsies. HR, HER2 and Ki67 expression were determinated by immunohistochemistry. Patients with HER2 IHC 2+ were further examined by CISH. Results: 2 (5.5 %) patients who were ER positive prior to treatment showed ER negativity after. In 3 (8.3 %) patients PR became negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Changes in ER and PR were not statistically significant (p = 0.056 and p = 0.083 respectively). Conversion of HER2 occured in 4 of 36 patients (11.1 %): in two from positive to negative and in two from negative to positive.

In mammalian cells, a major repair pathway to double-strand breaks is homologous recombination (HR). However, the role of BMI-1 in homologous recombination is still poorly understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BMI-1 silencing in homologous recombination protein markers. Method: MCF-7 cells are constitutively positive for BMI-1 and silencing was performed using siRNA + Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. Using double-staining immunofluorescence we analyzed homologous recombination markers and evaluated BMI-1 silencing impact on their immunolocalization. Results: BMI-1 silencing resulted in the reduction of nuclear expression of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 and the translocation of RAD51 from nucleus to cytoplasm. ATM expression changed from nucleus to nucleus and cytoplasm after silencing while ATR stained nucleus and cytoplasm in control but only nucleus in silenced samples. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that BMI-1 directly affects the homologous recombination markers, playing an important role in development and progression of breast cancer. Objective: Tumour cells display increased iron uptake, regardless of intracellular levels. Tumour-associated lymphocytes and macrophages putatively contribute to iron supply. CCL2, a leukocyte chemoattractant, was described to be regulated by intracellular iron status in neuroinflammation. Method: CCL2, CD68 and FPN immunohistochemistry was performed in 252 TMA spots from 101 primary samples (52 invasive ductal carcinomas, 17 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) and 32 reduction speciments). The number of CCL2-expressing macrophages and CD68positive cells were assessed. Hemosiderin deposits were detected with Perls' Prussian Blue staining. Results: CCL2 expression was increased in tumour cells and associated macrophages. CCL2 in epithelial cells and macrophages was positively correlated with iron deposition in stromal cells. The number of CD68+ cells and its CCL2 expression were positively correlated with tissue iron deposition. CCL2 expression in epithelium was positively correlated with FPN expression in stromal cells. CCL2 in macrophages was positively correlated with their FPN expression and negatively correlated with FPN in epithelial cells, in DCIS. Conclusion: CCL2 was correlated with increased tumour iron content and export in inflammatory cells, reinforcing their contribution to tumour iron nutrition. We report the existence of a positive feedback loop, implying autocrine and paracrine CCL2 signaling in breast cancer ironassociated alterations and progression.",

            "text": "Objective: Cadherin switch from epithelial to mesenchymal type is an important feature of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which stimulates metastasis in breast cancer. Increase of N-cadherin expression promotes adhesion of cancer and stromal cells, and their further invasion to stroma. N-cadherin participates in signal pathways PLC\u03b3, PI3K and MAPK. The latest increases MMP-9 expression and promotes Erk1/2 activation that lead to cancer cells invasion. The same signaling pathway acts in presence of HER-2/neu receptor that lead to high proliferation of cancer cells. Method: 250 cases of invasive lobular breast cancer were studied. The immunohistochemical method with use of Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human N-cadherin (Clone IAR06, Monosan, the Netherlands) and Rabbit Monoclonal Anti -HER2/neu antibody (Clone 4B5, Ventana) was applied. Results: Coexpression of N-cadherin and HER-2/neu was found in 72 (29 %) cases. We revealed the positive moderate correlation between Ncadherin and HER-2/neu expression (V = 0.41, p < 0.05). Conclusion: N-cadherin and HER-2/neu both participate in signaling pathway RAS/MAPK/Erk. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition connects with high metastatic potential of tumour and high proliferation of cancer cells as well.",

Grjunbergs Objective: Breast benign papillary lesions consists of the proliferation of ductal epithelium supported by fibrovascular stroma. Morphological interpretation of papillary lesions of the breast is challenging. In addition, the clinical presentation of benign and malignant lesions are overlapping. Method: The retrospective analysis of clinical and histopathological testing of two cases. Results: First case. A 37-year old female with ulcerated tumour for 2 years in the right breast. Second case. A 23-year-old patient with right nipple enlargement and erosion. Conclusion: The clinical diagnosis of papillary lesions is still challenging. The precise histopathological examination is important for optional breast surgery. Objective: The term metaplastic carcinoma refers to a group of neoplasms characterized by differentiation of neoplastic epithelium into squamous and/or mesenchymal-like elements. It is a very rare carcinoma of the breast (incidence about 0,2 %, as referred in the literature). We present three cases of MBCs, a pure squamous cell carcinoma, a fibromatosis-like metaplastic cell carcinoma and a spindle cell carcinoma. Method: In our laboratory we received surgical specimens of three women, two of them aged 50 and one aged 85. The mean diameter of the tumours was 3,5 cm., with a whitish, fleshy gross appearance and infiltrating margins. Results: Histopathologically, the cells had squamous and spindle cell morphology. Immnohistochemically, they were ker AE1/AE3 +, ker 3412+, ker 5/6+, e-cadherin+ and ER-, PR-, c-erbB-2-. There are no well-defined prognostic markers. Conclusion: Differential diagnosis is broad, including phyllodes tumour, metastatic carcinomas and sarcomas. They behave aggressively with a poor overall prognosis, due to frequent metastases in visceral organs. There are no well-defined protocols for therapy. Complete surgical excision along with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy have been proposed. Objective: We present a case of 24 year old woman, who presents with bilateral granulomatous breast inflammation with abscess formation and fistula tracts that end in multiple draining openings in periareolar skin. We put emphasis on the differential diagnosis, because similar changes may be seen in autoimmune diseases, use of oral contraceptives, after pregnacy and lactation, and most importantly may present as background of invasive breast carcinoma. Method: The additional work-up of the specimen includes special stains as Ziel-Nilsen, PAS, Grocott and immunohistochemistry with CK AE1-AE3. Results: The mentioned above markers were all negative, wich excludes infectious agents and cocurrent carcinomaq thus supporting the diagnosis idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. Conclusion: The idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, that requires broad differential diagnosis, detailed anamnesis and sufficient amount of tissue for histologic examination. Careful examination should be performed to exclude breast cancer.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate expression of NF-\u03baB in breast cancer and to correlate the immunohistocemical expression of this marker with clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome. Method: This retrospective study included 208 consecutive newly diagnosed ductal invasive breast cancer patients operated at Department of Surgery, Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka, Croatia between 2000 and 2004 with long term follow up over 10 years. Immunohistochemical staining for NF-kB was done on tissue microarray and expression in more than or equal to 10 % nuclei of entire tumour area was considered positive. Results: NF-kB was positive in 31 % of tumours. Activation of NF-kB showed inverse correlation with expression of estrogen receptor (p = 0.005) and positive correlation with expression Ki-67 proliferation index (p = 0,015). We found better overall survival in NF-kB positive tumours in luminal A subtype (p = 0.021). Conclusion: Our results could be explained as consequence of possible tumour suppressing effect of NF-kB. We think that the practical relevance of NF-kB as prognostic indicator and potential target for specific therapies deserve further investigation. Abstract: Breast hamartomas are rare benign tumour-like nod\u00fcles composed of mammary glandular tissue, fibrous stroma, and fat mixed in various proportions. It was first described in 1971 as lipofibroadenoma, fibroadenolipoma or adenolipoma, based on the predominant component of the breast tissue. The lesion often gives the impression of \"breast within breast.\" Hamartomas are typically found in women who are premenopausal and in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Our case was a 30year old woman. She was admitted to clinic, complaining of a mass in her left breast since 3 months. Ultrasonographic examinations revealed a 4 cm mass diagnosed as fibroadenolipoma. Gross examination included a soft, circumscribed, lobulated mass with cleft-shaped cystic areas bordered by a thin fibrous pseudocapsule. Microscopic findings were composed of disorganized lobules with interspersed ducts in a background of collagenous stroma and mature fat limited by a pseudocapsule.There was no cytologic atypia or significant mitotic activity. Complete surgical excision is curative for this lesion. However, researchers have reported local recurrence within the first year after surgery in an adolescent patient whose tumour had been incompletely excised.",

Sener * Ataturk University, Dept. of Pathology, Erzurum, Turkey Abstract: Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas diagnosed at the breast can be primary or secondary. Both are relatively rare, they represent about 0.6 % s breast cancer. Eighty-year-old female patient with swelling and pain in her right breast attended to our outpatient clinic. On the ultrasound examination, lobulated countered, 3 \u00d7 7 cm sized solid mass was determined on the right upper outer quadrant. Histopathologic examination is recommended with the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer. In the histomorphological study of biopsy material, 3-4 times large in size mature atypical lymphocytes, formed infiltration between adipose tissue and the striated muscle tissue under the squamous epithelium, showing intense apoptosis and necrosis, containing nucleoli clarity, large nuclei and narrow cytoplasm and neoplastic infiltration consisting of mitotic figures was observed. In the immunohistochemical studies of this atypical lymphocytes, diffuse immunoreactivity with CD20 and CD79a was observed. In the remaining non-neoplastic lymphocytes CD-3 staining was observed. Ki-67 proliferative index was assessed as 95-98 %. Atypical lymphocytes was also observed with FNA. In light of these findings and patients histomorphological and immunohistochemical data 'Non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma (Diffuse Large Cell B Cell) was diagnosed. Patient was diagnosed with the same diagnosis from the right tonsil specimen and after 1 year right breast metastasis is observed. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of metastatic breast lymphoma.",

            "text": "Objective: To report the first case of a collision tumour between an invasive ductal carcinoma and a multicentric adenomyoepithelioma of the breast. Method: A 73-year-old woman was admitted for tumorectomy and excision of a 1 cm subcutaneous nodule of the left breast. Within the tumorectomy, a 2,2 cm ill-defined white indurated lesion was identified. Results: On microscopic examination, the 2,2 cm lesion consisted of a grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma, with intra-and peri-tumoural ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of high nuclear grade. No lympho-vascular tumour emboly was observed. Estrogen and progesterone receptors, as well as HER2 status (score 1+), were negative. The 1 cm subcutaneous nodule and other nodules found around the carcinoma turned out to be multiple adenomyoepitheliomas. Focally, the invasive ductal carcinoma and an adenomyoepithelioma collided. At this site, numerous DCIS foci with comedo-necrosis were intimately in contact and admixed with the adenomyoepithelioma. The myoepithelial cells were p63 and Smooth Muscle Actin positive, unlike the invasive ductal carcinoma and the DCIS. Conclusion: We hereby report the first case of a collision tumour between an invasive ductal carcinoma and a multicentric adenomyoepithelioma. This stresses the importance of investigating the most suspect nodule within a multicentric adenomyoepithelioma, while considering the possibility of a colliding invasive carcinoma. Objective: Herein, we describe the first documented case of glycogenrich clear cell carcinoma (GRCC) with lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Method: A 62-year-old postmenopausal Japanese woman presented with a palpable mass in the right breast. Ultrasonography revealed a wellmarginated, hypoechoic mammary tumour and systemic CT detected no other suspicious lesions. Results: The cut surface of the mastectomy specimen contained a lobulated, solid tumour, measuring 34 \u00d7 32 mm. Histologically, this tumour was composed of medullary invasive growth of carcinoma cells with central necrosis and hemorrhage. Polygonal carcinoma cells possessed abundant, clear and/or finely-granular cytoplasm, containing PASpositive diastase-labile glycogen, and irregularly-shaped, hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures were numerous (65/ 10HPFs). Marked lymphatic permeation and vascular infiltration, confirmed by D2-40 and/or CD31 immunostaining, were detected. This cancer was of the 'triple negative' subtype with a high MIB-1 index (70.1 %). Metastases were identified in 12 regional lymph nodes. Unfortunately, local recurrence was detected on palpation a month after surgery and multiple lung, liver, bone and lymph node metastases were identified on CT scans. Conclusion: The biological behavior and prognosis of breast GRCC remain controversial. Our present case with the unusual feature of extraordinary intramammary vessel invasion, as well as rather high stage and grade, followed a very rapid and aggressive clinical course. Objective: Myoepitheliosis is a benign mammary lesion characterized by a multifocal proliferation of myoepithelial cells growing into and/or around small ducts and ductules. Herein, we report a unique case of apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) arising from apocrine adenosis with massive myoepitheliosis producing excessive basement membrane material. Method: A 68-year-old woman presented with an induration in the right breast. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the lesion indicated apocrine cancer, and lumpectomy was performed. Results: Histologically, the lesion was composed of a lobulated aggregate of tubules having both epithelial and myoepithelial proliferations with stromal fibrosis. The epithelial cells had extensive apocrine metaplasia with varying degrees of nuclear atypism. In some parts, the epithelial cells having large nuclei with coarse chromatins and conspicuous nucleoli were arranged in solid and cribriform patterns with focal necrosis. Marked myoepithelial hyperplasia accompanied these epithelial lesions in not only a periductal but also an intraductal pattern. Furthermore, myoepithelial cells frequently showed a transition to lumpy deposits of amorphous basement membrane material. Conclusion: There may be a paradoxical link between excessive myoepithelial cell proliferation and breast cancer development, whereas tumour-suppressing functions of these myoepithelial cells might be inhibiting a cancer invasion by the DCIS in spite of its marked cellular atypicality. Objective: Breast cholesterol granuloma (BCG) is a rare benign condition that clinically and radiologically simulates malignancy. It appears as a mass lesion consisting of granulation tissue, rich in cholesterol crystals surrounded by foreign body giant cells. Method: We present a case of a 71-year-old woman with a 2 cm mass lesion of the upper, outer quadrant of her left breast. Mammography revealed a well circumscribed, round mass with microlobulated margins and scattered coarse calcifications. Cytologic evaluation was positive for atypia and lumpectomy followed. A surgical specimen encompassing a 2 cm partially cystic mass, with smooth fibrous walls and brownish friable content was received. At the periphery of the lesion diffuse, grayish fibrous areas were also observed. Results: Microscopically, the mass consisted of granulation tissue with irregular arrays of cholesterol crystals surrounded by foamy histiocytes and foreign body giant cells, along with fibrosis. Mammary duct ectasia was noted in the surrounding parenchyma. Conclusion: BCG is a rare, benign breast lesion of unclear pathogenesis. It is presumably related with rupture of ectatic ducts or breast macrocysts into surrounding parenchyma. The main significance of this entity is that it mimics malignancy and histological examination is necessary for the final diagnosis. Objective: Bloody nipple discharge (BND) is an important clinical symptom in mammary disorders, especially cancers. However, the association between this symptom and carcinomas with neuroendocrine features has not been sufficiently investigated or well understood. Method: We clinicopathologically studied 89 cases using biopsy and/or resection in 144 patients who came to the hospital for a thorough examination of symptomatic BND. Results: Of these 89 cases examined histologically, 24 (27 %) were solid papillary carcinomas (SPCs) and immuno-expressed chromogranin A and/or synaptophysin in >50 % of cells. Moreover, these solid papillary neuroendocrine carcinomas (SP-NECs) made up 44 % (24/55) of the mammary cancers found because of the BND. The frequency of diagnosing malignancy preoperatively in 24 SP-NECs was 4 % by nipple discharge cytology, 40 % by fine needle aspiration cytology, 62 % by core needle biopsy and 67 % by mammotome biopsy. The 24 SP-NECs were subclassified into SPC in situ (9 cases), SPC with microinvasion (7 cases) and SPC with invasion (8 cases). Conclusion: NECs relevant to SPC, often under-diagnosed preoperatively, accounted for an important share of breast conditions associated with BND. It is, therefore, worth keeping this type of mammary cancer in mind when performing medical examinations on patients with BND. Objective: Herein, we describe the first case of a mammary neuroendocrine tumour (NET) histologically recognized as originating from a central papilloma. Method: A 43-year-old premenopausal Japanese woman presented with a clinical symptom of bloody nipple discharge. Ultrasonography revealed a sharply elevated hypoechoic mass in a dilated large duct immediately beneath her left nipple, suggesting an intraductal papilloma. Results: The cut surface of the lumpectomy specimen contained a circumscribed gray-whitish tumour in a prominently dilated lactiferous duct. Histopathologically, this intracystic tumour was supported by arborized and/or intricate fibrovascular cores lined with myoepithelial cells within a proliferation of two different epithelial cells: benign ductal cells and carcinoma cells. Benign ductal cells closely lining the myoepithelial cells were cuboidal to columnar in shape with relatively dark-staining nuclei. There was pseudoinvasion at the periphery of the lesion. Carcinoma cells had a predominantly solid growth, were polygonal or occasionally spindle-shaped, and had fine-granular cytoplasm and ovoid nuclei with fine-granular chromatin. Carcinoma cells showed microinvasion and vascular infiltration with no intraductal spreading through surrounding ducts of the intracystic tumour. Immunohistochemically, chromogranin A and synaptophysin were diffusely-positive in carcinoma cells.",

Method: A 60-year-old postmenopausal Japanese woman presented with slight skin retraction in the right breast. Ultrasound-guided 16-G automated core needle biopsy (CNB) of the irregular, hypoechoic breast mass yielded a pathological diagnosis of carcinoma. Results: The cut surface of the lumpectomy specimen contained a poorly-marginated, gray-whitish solid tumour, measuring 12 \u00d7 10 mm. Histologically, this tumour was composed of a solid and/or trabecular invasive growth of carcinoma cells with a highly vascular stroma. Polygonal carcinoma cells possessed fine-granular cytoplasm and round-to-ovoid nuclei with fine-granular chromatin. We detected small subcutaneous scars with disseminated carcinoma cell clusters, causallyrelated to the preoperative CNB, away from the main tumour. Immunohistochemically, the carcinoma cells were positive for chromogranin A and NCAM. The patient received anastrozole as endocrine therapy, but refused adjuvant radiation. She had become aware of a mass at the skin puncture site for the previous CNB 4 years after surgery. We pathologically confirmed the recurrent NEC involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Conclusion: To reduce the clinical impact of tumour displacement, we need to consider preventive radiation therapy for needle pathways, their excision and/or use of vacuum-assisted biopsy devices. Objective: Primary neuroendocrine tumours (pNET) of the breast make up less than 0.1 % of the breast cancer, but their outcome is among the worst. They chiefly affect middle aged women and usually do not involve the axillary lymph nodes at diagnosis. Surgery is the first therapeutic option. Also, adjuvant chemotherapy is highly effective due to their chemo-sensitivity. Method: We present a case of pNET of the breast, NGS = 7 in a middle aged Caucasian woman. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed. Results: Microscopic evaluation indentified limited areas of in situ ductal breast carcinoma; the tumour demonstrates positivity for synaptophysin and chromogranin in more than half of the malignant cells, very strong diffuse positivity with ER(89 %) and 40 % positivity for PR. Her2/Neu aspect was borderline(2+) with negative in situ hybridization test. The patient does not have any other synchronous neuroendocrine tumour and no specific signs or symptoms. Conclusion: pNET of breast can be demonstrated only using immunohistochemical assays, but since neuroendocrine markers are not a usual component of breast panel, this feature must be at least suspected on usual hematoxylin-eosin slides. Positive diagnosis is important, since this tumour is particularly aggressive and bears a poor prognosis. *Dragusin and Pop are first authors in equal proportion. 6 %, unequal (2+) 7,04 %, positive (3+) -10,33 %. When we compared each cases for HER2 there was moderate agreement with negative (score 0) and positive(score 3+) case around 70 % and poor agreement in HER2 (1+2+ category) -only 50 % 25 % including both false negative and false positive estimations. We thought such kind disagreement in individual group was due to using different primary antibodies (all not FDA-approved) in previous years compared with PATH WAY\u00ae rmAb 4B5 (Ventana) antibody which was used for TMA slides. Conclusion: For breast cancer TMAs could be reasonable alternative to WS. Especially for Her2 testing, should be used only FDA approved systems and this technique allow reduce time, reagent and finally cost of such type of analysis.",

Cybulski * Pomeranian Medical University, Dept. of Pathology, Szczecin, Poland Objective: Tumours from patients with BRCA1/2 germline mutations are known to be especially sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents (e.g., platinum drugs) and to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. The purpose of this report is to compare the expression of genes engaged in DNA damage repair pathway in triple-negative hereditary breast cancers without pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2 (BRCAX) and hereditary triple-negative breast cancers with BRCA1/2 mutations. Method: Total RNA was extracted from 30 formalin fixed and paraffin embedded consecutive hereditary triple-negative breast cancers. A realtime PCR arrays based on UPL probes were designed and used to profile the expression of 90 most important DNA repair genes including e.g., BRCA, PARP, CHEK, ATM, XRCC, ERCC, PALB2, PTEN, RECQL, RAD and FANC family. Results: The expression profile of studied genes was highly similar between BRCAX and BRCA1/2-associated triple-negative breast cancers. Only expression of USP1 gene (ubiquitin specific peptidase 1) was significantly downregulated (1.8 fold change, p = 0.03) in BRCAX group. Conclusion: Similarity of expression profile of genes engaged in DNA damage repair between both groups suggests that identification of BRCAX patients with triple-negative cancers based on family history can increase the proportion of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who may be eligible for therapy using PARP inhibitors and platinum drugs. Objective: Breast metastases (BM) from extra-mammary neoplasms are rare. The most common origin are lymphomas/leukemias and melanomas. Our goal is to study the clinicopathological features of BM of malignant solid tumours. Method: We identified 15 cases of BM from solid tumours. The clinicopathologic characteristics were reviewed. Results: All but three patients were women, median age: 55 years. Twelve patients had prior history of cancer: In 3 the initial presentation was as BM. Ten patients developed metastases in other organs after diagnosis of BM. The median interval from diagnosis of the primary tumour to the BM was 14,2 months. Fourteen cases were presented as single BM. Macroscopically, all tumours were well defined. Average diameter: 1.8 cm (0,5-4,5 cm) . Primary tumours were: melanoma (3), kidney carcinoma (3), ovarian carcinoma (2), lung carcinoma (2), colon adenocarcinoma (1), oropharyngeal-SCC (1), medullary-thyroid carcinoma (1), ASPS (1), and anaplastic ependymoma (1). Thirteen patients with follow-up: median 26,9 months: 9 died and 4 alive. The median survival from diagnosis of BM: 8.43 months. Conclusion: Metastatic tumours in the breast are rare. Given a breast single nodule in patients with known extramammary malignancy, we should suspect a metastasis. The diagnosis of BM carries a poor prognosis, with a very low survival. The analysis of new molecular factors is crucial to obtain further insights into the mechanisms involved in the tumourigenesis of each tumour subtype. In this study the presence of hypermethylation of an important Ras-effector of RASSF (RAS-association domain family) and its clinical value has been studied in breast cancer subtypes. Method: The hypermethylation of genes was analyzed in 198 breast tumours of different subtypes by means of methylation-specific PCR and this hypermethylation was confirmed by bisulfite-sequencing. Different patterns of RASSF expression for distinct tumour subtypes were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: The hypermethylation of this gene was much more frequent in luminal subtypes than in non-luminal tumours (p = 0.001). This alteration is associated with better prognosis in multivariate statistical analysis (P = 0.039). Conclusion: The hypermethylation of certain genes is different in luminal and non-luminal tumours and can be promising genes with clinical involvement in breast cancer. Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the difference between estrogen and progesterone hormone receptor status in HER2 positive breast cancer cases. Method: 144 consecutive breast cancer cases diagnosed between 2012 and 2014 in the Clinical hospital Acibadem Sistina were included in this retrospective study. Representative samples of tumour tissue were used for the immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization. For the evaluation of hormone receptors, primary antibodies and detection system from Dako were used and the slides were stained using Dako autostainer Link 48. HER2 status was evaluated using Hercep test from Dako. On equivocal HER2 cases, dual color CISH was performed using HER2 and CEN-17 probes. Results: Our results showed that only 23 % of the HER2 positive cases revealed positivity for progesterone receptor as well (p < 0,05), whereas 57 % of these HER2 positive cases were also positive for estrogen receptor (p>0,05). Conclusion: These data suggest that HER2 overexpression might have negative influence on progesterone receptor expression in breast cancer patients. Further follow up studies should be performed in order to assess the prognostic significance of these findings. Objective: The main aim of the present study was to correlate the morphological features of estrogen receptor negative ductal breast carcinomas with pathological data and other prognostic variables. Proliferative activity using MIB-1(Ki-67) will be investigated and correlated with pathological data. Method: A total of 450 operable breast cancer patients, diagnosed from January 2010 to December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed and 141 patients with ER-negative tumours were identified. Only 60 cases were evaluated. Results: All the 60 patients were female with an age range from 33 to 74 years. Most of the tumours are \u2265 2 cm in size (46/60 cases; 76. 6 %) . There were 34/60 cases (56,6 %) with lymph node metastases. A high proportion of tumour was graded 3 (35/60 cases; 58.3 %) followed by grade 2 (22/60 cases; 20.2 %) and only 3 cases of grade 1 (5 %). All of cases showed PR negative, while 33.3 % of cases (20/60) were c-erbB2 positive. MIB-1 was positive (>20 %) in 40 (70 %) of 60 ER negative breast tumours. Conclusion: MIB-1 was found to be positive in more than 50 % of ER negative tumours. Given that tumours with high proliferative index occurs in patients with poor clinical outcome, MIB-1 is a potentially reliable prognostic marker in this hormonally resistant subtype of breast cancers. Objective: Carcinosarcomas are defined as malignant neoplasms showing both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. We report a case of a carcinosarcoma of adrenal gland origin. Method: An 81 year old patient presented with large adrenal mass without history of hypertension and was led into surgery. Results: The adrenal gland weighted 480 gr and its dimensions were 11 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 cm. The gland was entirely occupied by a large neoplasm with necrotic areas. Histological examination revealed a biphasic neoplasm with distinct epithelioid and spindle areas. The epithelioid areas consisted of nests or sheets of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, moderately atypical nuclei with eosinophilic nucleoli and multiple mitosis. The epithelioid cells expressed MelanA, Synaptophysin, Vimentin and CD56 while they were negative for Chromogranin, Inhibin, Calretinin, SALL-4, OCT3/4 and characteristically negative for cytokeratins. The spindle areas consisted of intersecting fascicles of cells with moderately atypical nuclei with mitotic activity and large areas of geographic necrosis. No heterologous differentiation was noted. The spindle cells expressed Desmin and Smooth Muscle Actin but failed to express Myogenin, MyoD1, MelanA or Synaptophysin. The immunomorphological findings were typical of leiomyosarcoma. Conclusion: Adrenocortical carcinosarcoma is an extremely rare and aggressive neoplasm. Detailed immunophenotyping helps to differentiate it from the extra-adrenal carcinosarcomas.",

Laboratory evaluation showed normal cortisol and catecholamine levels. Histopathological examination revealed a corticomedullary mixed tumour of adrenal gland. Method: The patient underwent a laparoscopic adrenalectomy of the tumour, which was identified by computed tomography. Macroscopically, it is a well-circumscribed tumour (2.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm) with a thin, fibrotic capsule, yellowish-orange, homogeneous. Immunohistochemistry was also performed. Results: The tumour was composed of an admixed population of both adrenal cortical cells and pheochromocytes. The adrenal cortical component is composed of enlarged cells with eosinophilic, slightly granular cytoplasm with round to oval nuclei. The pheochromocytes display finely granular, basophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are larger and ovoid in shape. Immunohistochemical studies were positive both for cortical cells (inibin-\u03b1, synaptophysin, melan-A and calretinin) and medullary cells (S-100 and chromogranin A) . Conclusion: Adrenal gland can be thought of as two separate organs, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, each with distinct structure, function, and embryologic origin. Corticomedullary mixed tumour is a rare adrenal tumour, reported in not more than 20 patients to date. Objective: Primary thyroid lymphoma (PThL) is an uncommon neoplasm accounting for 5 % of all thyroid gland malignant lesions. Pathology features compared with CT, ultrasound exam and cytology findings were analyzed. The patients were 6 women (79, 78, 76, 73, 65, 62-years-old) and 58-year-old man. Total thyroidectomy were performed in 2012-2014. Method: The diagnoses were confirmed by IHC. Results: Patients presented with mass lesion (7), with rapidly enlargement (4), and compression symptoms(3). Tumour size ranged from 5 to 12 cm in maximal dimension. PThL involved one lobe (1 case), both lobes (6), with extension to adipose tissue(6), skeletal muscles (3), paratracheal tissue (3), trachea(1), v.jugularis interna (1), skin(1). Cytology findings identificated lymphoma in 1 case, in 2 -anaplastic carcinomas were suspected. 2 MALTlymphoma and 5 DLBCL (3 centroblastic and 2 anaplastic type) were found. All cases of DLBCL shows CD20(+),CD5(-),CD10(-),BCL6(+) phenotype. Plasmacytoid features were seen in 1 MALT-lymphoma, in 3 DLBCL. All PThL occurs in the settings of chronic lymphocytic thyroidities, 4 of 5 glands with DLBCL had areas of MALT-lymphomas. Conclusion: PThLs occur predominantly older aged women. Plasmacytic differentiation or plasmacytoid features are common. Specificity of CT, ultrasound exam and cytology findings were low for diagnosis of the PThL. Objective: Patients with concomitant adrenocortical carcinoma and myelolipoma are extremely rare and in the best of our knowledge there is only one case reported in the available literature. We present a case of incidentally discovered nonfunctioning adrenocortical carcinoma with concomitant myelolipoma. The patient was 72 years old man with benign prostatic hyperplasia, severe prostatitis and cystitis, which was a reason for attending physician. Method: Echosonography revealed right adrenal gland mass confirmed by computed tomography. The patient underwent unilateral adrenalectomy and operative material was received at the Institute of Pathology in Skopje for histological analysis. Results: The adrenal gland weighed 113 g and measured 8 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3,5 cm. On cut surface a binodular well circumscribed tumour mass measuring 5,5 \u00d7 3,5 \u00d7 3,5 cm was seen. It was partly light brown and partly white-gray colored. A central hemorrhage was present in one half of the tumour which revealed microscopically to be adrenocortical carcinoma. On microscopic examination we found cortical carcinoma showing cytologic atypia, necrosis, hemorrhage, 6 mitoses/10 HPF and venous invasion in one half of the tumour mass and collision myelolipoma in the other half. Conclusion: Although extreme rare an adrenocortical carcinoma with concomitant myelolipoma should be included in differential diagnosis of adrenal gland masses. Objective: Adrenal cystic lesions are uncommon but due to improved radiologic imaging techniques their appearance seems to increase. We analyzed the clinical and radiological findings of 10 patients with adrenal cysts and we analyzed the pathological features of the operative material. Method: Standard dissection procedure of the operative material and paraffin embedded tissue sections were made, stained by HE and immunohistochemicaly with CD34, CD 31, CKWS and AE1/AE3. Results: The mean age of the patients was 40,6 years. The female to male ratio was 2,3:1. All the cysts were diagnosed as cystic lesions by imaging techniques except one. The most present clinical symptom was abdominal pain. The diameter of the cysts measured from 2 to 7 cm. Four of the cysts were diagnosed as pseudocysts and six as endothelial. They all were well circumscribed, six were multilocular and 4 filed with blood. Six were lined by CD34 and CD31 positive cells, and four had no lining cells. Nests of adrenal cells were found in 6 cases and calcification in three cases. Conclusion: Adrenal cysts showed nonspecific clinical and radiologic finding, and were more often present in female. Endothelial cysts were more common cysts in our study.",

            "text": "Ile105Val polymorphism in GSTP1 and the risk for thyroid carcinomas in a population from Central Bulgaria Objective: Thyroid carcinoma (TC) is one of the most frequently endocrine malignancy in Bulgaria. The mechanism of thyroid carcinogenesis is still not fully elucidated. The exposure to ionizing radiation may produce genotoxins, potentially detoxified and eliminated by glutathione Stransferases. We conducted a case-control study to explore the possible role of Ile105Val (+315A>G) GSTP1 SNP in TC. Method: We genotyped for Ile105Val (+315A>G) GSTP1 SNP 49 patients with TC and 126 non-affected by the disease controls from the region of Stara Zagora, Bulgaria usind PCR-RFLP method. Results: We found that the genotype and allele frequencies differed significantly between patients with TC and control individuals (p < 0.0001 for both). The genotype distribution determined 10.56-fold higher risk (OR = 1.56, 95 % CI: 4.05-27.40, p < 0.0001) of developing thyroid cancers in carriers of variant G allele containing genotypes (AG+GG) compared to those with AA genotype. Similarly, the variant G allele was associated with 2.60-fold higher risk for this malignancy than the more common A allele. The genotype distribution was not associated with clinical characteristics and survival of the patients with TC. Conclusion: Our results suggest that GSTP1 could increase disease risk susceptibility and could act as a risk factor for thyroid carcinoma in individuals from the region of Stara Zagora, Bulgaria Objective: Papillary carcinoma accounts for 60 to 70 % of thyroid cancer. WHO defines papillary carcinoma as follows: Differentiation vesicular papillary and follicular architectures with nuclear changes of characteristics Several variants, or non-influential on prognosis, have been described over the years. Method: Total thyroidectomy (THT) is the surgical procedure as practiced in our recruitment. All surgical specimens were entrusted benefited from a microscopic study after which an immunohistochemical study was performed with a variable antibody panel. Indirect immunoperoxidase is the technique used in our laboratory. Results: During the period 2012-2013 we counted 52cases papillary carcinoma. The distribution of the variants of papillary carcinoma is dominated by the follicular variant: CPV representing 29 % of all cases and 23 % are encapsulated CPV remaining sub-morphological type of excellent prognosis. Our series does not have the variants of diffuse sclerosing variant of CP Obneil cells. The variant of the CP-type \"tall cell\" represents 1 case in our series, it remains pejorative, it was a male patient aged 16. Conclusion: The variants of papillary carcinoma correspond to real clinicopathological variables entities diagnostic difficulties. The net increase in the CP in its follicular variant is explained in part by a better understanding of this variation, and partly by the considerable contribution of immunostaining with antibodies that the HMBE1 showed its diagnostic specificity in thyroid pathology. Objective: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most frequent thyroid cancer, whereas primary thyroid lymphoma is distinctly rare. Method: Right-sided, measuring 4.3 \u00d7 2.2 cm nodule was examined by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Results: By the presence of a rich population of monomorphic noncohesive large lymphoid cells and absence of thyroid follicular cells, a cytodiagnosis of lymphoma included a differential diagnosis of lymphocytic thyroiditis was made. Subsequent histologic examination revealed CD45 / CD20 / Bcl-6 positive, cytokeratin / CD3 / CD5 / CD30 negative tumour cells arranged diffusely in the whole thyroid coexisting with a separate 1.3 \u00d7 1.0 cm nodule of PTC in the right lobe. Conclusion: The goal of this case is, a cytodiagnosis of this extremely rare coexistence was possible by adequate sampling both of these discrete nodules preoperatively.",

PanNETs may arise at any age, but most occur between the ages of 30 and 60 tes. We present a rare case of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour of the pancreas extending to the stomach, and lymph nodes. Method: The patient was a 38-year-old woman. She visited our hospital with epigastric pain. Endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass measuring 87 \u00d7 61 mm in the tail of the pancreas. On initial, the case was diagnosed by biopsy, and the distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, partial gastrectomy, adipose tissue and lymph nodes were performed. Results: The cat surface of the tumour was white, lobulated, with cystic change. Histologically, the architecture revealed insular, trabecular and solid or cribriform nets morphologies. The cytonuclear atypical and mitotic figures were moderate. The massive tumour invaded into the serous and muscles of the stomach without invasion of the spleen. Perineural and vascular invasion were noted. In addition 02/16 lymph nodes were positive for metastasis. Tumours cells positively stained for chromogranin A and synaptophysin. Positivity of the ki67 was less than 20 %. Conclusion: Pancreatic NETs are rare tumours that, depending on subtype and histologic features, vary in clinical aggressiveness. The most important prognostic factor is whether or not the tumour can be removed surgically. Other significant prognostic for patients with an islet cell tumour / pancreatic endocrine neoplasm include the size of the tumour, the presence or absence of blood vessel invasion, the presence or absence of metastases to lymph nodes or other organs.",

            "text": "Objective: Most common primary adrenocortical neoplasms are adenomas (ACA), tumours with perfect prognosis. Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) are rare (0,5-2 per million annually) and carry poor 5-years survival rate of 38-46 %. Therefore, distinction between ACA and ACC is of utmost importance. Method: We present the case of a 40-year-old woman with incidentally found 3.5 cm in diameter, purely oncocytic adrenocortical tumour (OACT) presenting extremely bizarre, pleomorphic cells and nuclei. No necrosis, vascular nor capsular invasion was found. Unfortunately, mitotic count in such tumours can be very difficult as some degenerating/bizarre nuclei can resemble atypical mitoses. According to Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia system even one atypical mitosis results in diagnosis of oncocytic ACC. Ki67 proliferative index was scored 6-7 % in hotspots, high for ACA. Reticulin stain showed reticulin network disruption that can occur in both ACA and ACC. Finally, phosphohistone-H3 antibody was used and a few, typical mitoses were stained. Results: Oncocytic ACA was diagnosed. In the commentary close follow-up based on high Ki67 proliferative index was advised. Conclusion: We suggest using phosphohistone-H3 antibody to differentiate degenerating/bizarre nuclei from atypical mitoses in OACT. Objective: We report a case of a 53 year old man with multiple vertebrae fractures and osteoporosis under medical treatment with denosumab for the past 4 years. He had a previous history of relapsing cardiac myxomas and large bowel adenomas. Spotty pigmentation of lower limbs and nevi of thorax was found in physical examination. Dexamethasone suppression test showed ACTH independent Cushing syndrome and CT revealed nodular lesions in both adrenals, multiple nodules in the thyroid gland and diffuse testicular calcification. Method: We received left and right adrenal glands, within a 3 month interval, weighing 23 and 16,5 gr respectively. Confluent micronodular brown lesions were observed in cut sections. Results: Microscopically we observed nodules of large eosinophilic cells with brown pigment, nuclear pleomorphism with focally giant nuclei and low mitotic activity, features compatible with primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease. Myxomatous areas in the adrenal cortex and adjacent fat were also found. Molecular genetic test revealed a point mutation in the PRKAR1A gene. Conclusion: Carney complex is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome and careful screening of the first degree members should be conducted and short and long term follow up controls are important since the syndrome has malignant potential and occasional ominous prognosis. Objective: Graves' disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroidism caused by excessive thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persists mainly in human B lymphocytes. We have reported that TRAb predisposed EBV infected cells (TRAb(+)EBV(+) cells) can produce TRAb in response to EBV reactivation. TRAb is recognized to be IgG class antibody; thus, class-switch recombination through activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required to produce TRAb. In this study, we examined the expressions of AID mRNA and protein in EBV reactivated cells. Method: We separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 9 Graves' disease patients and 9 healthy controls. We used these PBMCs and short-term cultured PBMCs as samples. The cultured PBMCs were then transferred to 33\u00b0C to reactivate persistent EBV as previously. We confirmed the subpopulation of sample cells by flow-cytometry. The expression of AID was examined by real-time PCR and immuno-histochemistry. Conclusion: Flow-cytometric analysis revealed that B cell population enriched by short-term culture, and EBV reactivation was accompanied by increase of plasma cell frequency. We detected the increased mRNA and protein expressions of AID by EBV reactivation induction, which suggested that TRAb production from TRAb(+)EBV(+) cells in response to EBV reactivation is related to class-switch recombination by AID.",

Baron * , M. Postiglione, C. Trombetta, E. Punzo, M. Elefante, F. Quarto Objective: Paragangliomas (PGLs), either sympathetic or parasympathetic, are rare neuroendocrine tumours derived from neural crest cells. Sympathetic PGLs, mostly abdominal, produce catecholamine excess. Method: We researched differences, in histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC), in tumour progression, based on lymphnode metastases, in 2, not functional, appendix PGLs. One was discovered during screening colonoscopy for colon cancer family history. The other was an \"incidentaloma\" in acute appendicitis. The former was larger, more locally extensive, metastasized in a local lymphnode. Results: In both cases histology showed nests of polygonal granular cells, mixed with anastomoting or trabecular pattern. In the lymphnode metastatic case nested/trabecular pattern was less evident, with prevalence of solid/diffuse growth; sustentacular cells and hyaline globules were reduced or disappeared. IHC confirmed positivity of chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, focally CKAE1/AE3,CK7,CK20 of chief cells, and S100 in sustentacular cells. Differences in IHC expression were in CK focal positivity, S100 reduction/absence, and slight increase of Ki67 noted in nodal metastatic case. Conclusion: No histological or immunohistochemical feature was alone able to identify metastatic potential. Data suggested that a multifactorial scoring system can help in discriminating tumours with a greater risk of metastasis. Because PGLs often metastasize late, use of criteria requires a long term follow-up and confirmation in larger series. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is not part of PHTS; a few studies however, have identified C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) in this syndrome. We report Ccell abnormalities in PHTS patients. Method: We revised the H&E and calcitonin stained slides from 67 paraffin blocks (3 total thyroidectomy and 1 left lobectomy) of 4 PHTS patients.",

Results: Four cases (16 %) were positive by both method, immunochemistry and molecular, with 100 % of concordance. The positive cases were in patients with worse oncologic stage, with extrathyroideal extension and presented a higher rate of loco-regional lymphoid involvement. The no mutated and negative for immunochemistry cases were organ-confined lesions at the time of diagnosis and have no lymphoid involvement. Conclusion: There is high concordance (100 % in our serie) between RT-PCR with COBAS 4800 method (Roche) and immunochemistry by anti-BRAF V600E(VE1) antibody in PTC and the positive cases have a more aggressive clinical behavior. This result confirms that BRAF immunochemistry using anti-BRAF V600E(VE1) antibody can be used as surrogate marker of BRAF V600E mutation in PTC.",

We report clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical evaluation of Ki67, p53, \u03b2-catenin, E-Cadherin, HER2, estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and androgen (AR) receptors. Method: Medical records, pathological and immunohistochemical studies of eight cases of ACC. Results: Eight patients (3 males and 5 females), mean age 48.4 years (34-71). The tumours were in TNM Stage II-1 case, alive and well (A&W) at 90 months; Stage III-6 cases, two dead of disease (DOD), two alive with disease (AWD) and two A&W; Stage IV-1 case, DOD at 3 months. Mean follow-up was 32.1 months (3-102). Nuclear staining of \u03b2-catenin was observed in three cases (37,5 %): two DOD (3 and 15 months) and one with local recurrence at 7 months, AWD at 12 months. PR expression was observed in all cases. Nuclear p53 staining was positive in 5 cases. Mean Ki67 expression was 30 % (5-60 %) . No E-Cadherin, HER2, ER or AR expression was noticed. Conclusion: ACC is often diagnosed in an advanced stage. Ki67 and p53 were not associated with relapse or metastasis in our series. Nuclear \u03b2catenin expression was observed in cases with worse outcome and appears to be an important prognostic factor. PS-02-022 Primary osteosarcoma of the thyroid gland E. Stojkoska * , N. Basheska, A. Qerimi, B. Jankovska, Z. Spirovski, V. Janevska * University Clinic of Oncology and Histopathology, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia Objective: Primary mesenchymal tumours of the thyroid gland are extremely rare. One percent of the thyroid tumours are reported to be sarcomas, and the infrequency of these lesions is a reason for the difficulties in achieving right diagnosis. Method: We report a case of primary thyroid osteosarcoma (PTO) in 54-years old female who underwent surgery of the thyroid left lobe, with an unexpected final diagnosis, focusing on the histopathological and immunohistochemical features, which helped in differential diagnosis. Results: The surgical specimen was a thyroid lobe measuring 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8, 5 cm. The cut surface showed gritty, grayish-white tumour with areas of hemorrhage which almost entirely infiltrate the left lobe, measuring 9 cm. The microscopic examination showed a high-grade malignant neoplasm with necrotic areas composed of polygonal and fusiform cells, numerous osteoclast-like giant cells and focal osteoid deposition. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive expression for vimentin and osteopontin, and negative immunostaing for cytokeratin 19, epithelial membrane antigen, thyroid transcription factor-1, calcitonin and thyroglobulin, with a high mitotic index (60 %) of the tumour cell nuclei, determinate by Ki-67 antibody. Thus, the diagnosis of PTO of a predominantly teleangiectatic variant was established, that was confirmed with additional CD34 immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: PTO is extremely rare tumour that should be considered in thyroid pathology and immunohistochemistry is of decisive significance. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify histopathology and clinical features of ATC and their relevance to prognosis. Method: This retrospective study concerned data of 17 cases of ATC collected from 2000 to 2014 at Immuno-Histo-Cytology department of Salah Azaiz Institute of cancer in Tunisia. Results: Mean patient age at diagnosis was 69 years and there were 7 men and 10 women. The signs of local compression were present in 7 cases. Cervical ultrasonography was performed for all patients. All the cases had intrathyroidal tumours. Ten patients presented lymph node metastasis. Of the 17 patients, 7 cases had distant metastases. The lung and the liver were the most site of distant metastasis. The mean tumour diameter was 7,9 cm. All tumours immunophenotype were Cytokeratine(+), Vimentin (+), ACE(+) and Tyroglobuline (-). 70,6 % of the tumours overexpressed P53 and median Ki67 proliferation index was 76,5 %. All the patients received surgical treatment, 10 received surgery alone, 5 received radiation treatment with surgery, and 2 received surgery plus radiation treatment and chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 10 months, 14 patients died.",

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate expression of Cytokeratin 19 (CK19), CD56, HBME-1, Galectin-3 (Gal-3) and to determine microvascular density (MVD) in benign and malignant H\u00fcrthle cell tumours (HCTs). Method: We reviewed 30 cases of HCTs (20 carcinomas, 10 adenomas). Tissue microarray was constructed, containing minimum two tissue cores of each tumour, taken from the area right beneath the capsule. Immunostaining was considered positive if more than 10 % of tumour cells were positive irrespective of staining intensity, for CK19, HBME-1, Gal-3. Conversely, CD56 expression in less than 10 % of tumour cells was considered positive. Blood vessels were marked using CD31, panendothelial marker and counted applying modified Weidner method. Results: Concerning expression of CK19, HBME-1, Gal-3, CD56 in HCTs no significant difference between adenomas and carcinomas was found (p = 0.894; p = 0.176; p = 0.065; p = 0.450 respectively). MVD was expressed as number of vessels per square millimeter, and it was higher in carcinomas (median = 215 /mm2) compared to adenomas (136/ mm2; p = 0.028). ROC analysis was performed. In case the number of blood vessels is equal or higher than 187/mm2, sensitivity is 75 % and specificity is 70 % for carcinoma. Conclusion: MVD can serve as ancillary tool in diagnosis of HCTs, especially in those cases where capsular or vascular invasion is questionable.",

Herein, we present a case of a 78-year-old woman who presented with dyspnea and on imaging was found to have a large solitary thyroid mass. Method: Intraoperative frozen section was performed indicating a high grade neoplasm. Total thyroidectomy followed. Results: We received the thyroid gland weighing 148 gr. Upon gross examination a circumscribed, hemorrhagic tumour with maximal diameter of 6,9 cm, was noted at the right lobe. At the left lobe three colloid nodules were found. Microscopic examination revealed a high grade invasive neoplasm with extended necrosis. Cleft-like anastomosing spaces were recognized lined by epithelioid neoplastic cells, with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli. There were also multinucleated giant neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD31 and CD34 and negativity for pancytokeratin, EMA and TTF-1. The rest of the thyroid gland showed nodular hyperplasia. Based on the above, the diagnosis of high grade primary thyroid angiosarcoma was made. Conclusion: Primary thyroid angiosarcoma is a rare neoplasm, being more frequent in mountainous areas, such as the region of Epirus where the present patient lives. Multinucleated neoplastic giant cells although very rare feature in angiosarcomas, were several in this case.",

This study focuses on the utility of this antibody for BRAF V600E screening in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs). Method: 53 ATCs were studied using both BRAF pyrosequencing and VE1 antibody. When the tumour contained a differentiated element, each component was separately tested. The intensity of staining was graded from 0 (negative) to 3+ (strong). Results: 15 of the 53 tumours were associated with differentiated carcinoma; 6 poorly differentiated carcinomas and 9 papillary carcinomas (PTCs). BRAF V600E was identified in 7 ATCs (13.2 %), 4 of which were associated with tall cell variant (TC) PTC. The TC component also showed BRAF V600E. All 7 ATCs and 4 TC PTC components were moderately to strongly positive for VE1. Additionally, seven and two ATCs showed 1+ and 2+ reaction, respectively, corresponding to wild type BRAF. Conclusion: VE1 immunohistochemistry is a useful method for detecting BRAF when moderate to strong reaction is regarded as positive. In BRAF V600E mutated tumours, both ATC and PTC component were equally mutated, confirming the view that some of the ATCs are transformed from differentiated thyroid tumours.",

The second operation was adrenalectomy and the pathology results showed the presence of a unique morphologically distinct form of adrenal hyperplasia called primary pigmented nodular adrenal cortical hyperplasia. Conclusion: Pituitary adenomas occuring in conjunction with adrenal gland hyperplasia are a rare findings that should prompt a search for other characteristic signs of Carney's complex. Careful evaluation of these rare patients should be performed, in order to prevent more serious complications in other involved organs. Objective: Thyroid papillary carcinomas are named as papillary mirocarcinomas (PMC) when the greatest dimension is under or equal to 1 cm. It has a favorable prognosis but some factors affect the prognosis adversely. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between KI67 and E-cadherin expressions in PMCs with some clinicopathological features such as age, gender, tumour subtype, dimension, precence of sclerosis and capsular invasion. Method: A retrospective analysis of 102 patients with PMCs in Izmir Tepecik Education and Research Hospital was performed. E-cadherin and KI67 expressions were evaluated immunohistochemically. Results: We observed capsular invasion in 26 (25.5 %) patients. The mean nuclear expression rate of KI67 was 2.56 % while cytoplasmic or membranous expressions of E-cadherin was 82.7 %. There were no significant correlations between with capsular invasion and E-cadherin (p = 0,431) or KI67 (p = 0,100) expressions. Contrary, there were significant correlations between capsular invasion and tumour dimension (p = 0,018), as well as capsular invasion and age of patients (p = 0,047). Conclusion: In the present study, it was shown that both Ecadherin and KI67 expressions were not correlated with other prognostic factors of PMCs. In addition, we demonstrated that the most important prognostic factor of PMCs was still the precence of capsular invasion.",

Method: A 51 years old man had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism with clinically expressed auto-immune antibodies. Follow-up cythology demonstrated suspected nuclei for papillary carcinoma (PTC) on an ecographic multinodular thyroid. Results: Total thyroidectomy was performed and several sections were observed after paraffin inclusion. Nodular pattern was observed with lymphoplasmocytic cells infiltration surrounding empty ductal structures of PTC-like cells. The diagnosis was sustained also by imunohistochemistry allowing PTC differential diagnosis. Conclusion: Hashimoto nodular chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis was reported together with extended ductal metaplasia. This philogenetic adaptation has been recognized in thyroid and more cases are expected to be reported, after its recognition in others exocrine glands. The authors thank Prof M. Sobrinho-Sim\u00f5es for his diagnosis advise. Objective: Medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) are rare tumours of neuroendocrin origin that arise from parafollicular C cells. MTC represents 4-5 % of all thyroid cancers. MTC can be either sporadic, usually isolated to one thyroid lobe, or familial, the latter of which is defined as the cancer syndrome known as Multipl Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). MEN 2 is result of the autosomally dominant missense gain of functin mutation in the RET proto -oncogen. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is the most common cause of death in MEN patient. Method: We report a case of a boy with MEN 2 A whose operative specimen at prophlactic thyroidectomy showed medullary microcarcioma and C-cell hyperplasia. Results: Medullary thyroid carcinoma occurs at a very young age in carriers ofgermline RET mutation. In patients with high -risk mutations prophilactic throidectomy is likely to be recommended. Ultrasound revealed an asymmetric thyroid, with a large hypo echogenic nodule in the right lobe, diagnosed as PTC with a fine needle aspiration biopsy. Total thyroidectomy was performed. During surgery it was observed that the tumour was adherent to the peri-thyroidal tissues and invaded the tracheal wall. Grossly, the right lobe was replaced by a firm, solid, gray-yellowish mass. Results: The tumour had a heterogeneous morphological pattern with solid, cribriform and morular areas, interposed by fibrotic septa and sparse colloid; it was noticed some nuclear clearing. Beta-catenin was positive, with a strong nuclear/cytoplasmic expression. In light of this diagnostic entity, the investigation proceeded. A colonoscopy was performed, it revealed multiple colonic polyps. Conclusion: CMV-PTC it's a rare neoplasm which is imperative to recognize because it will alert the clinician to investigate for familial adenomatous polyposis. In this case it was exceptionally important to distinguish it from other aggressive PTC variants, considering its extraglandular extension and lymphovascular invasion, in a manner that these features are more frequently associated with other aggressive variants of PTC. Objective: DeGeorgi Syndrome (DGS) is a birth defect that is marked by absence or underdevelopment of the thymus ans parathyroid glands. The child is born with a defective immune system and an abnormal low level of calcium (hypocalcemia) and parathormone in the blood. Having in the mind that \"partial\" DGS is discovered in autopsy, that the prevalence ranges from 1: 4000 to 1: 6395 and that clinical symptoms were induced by hypofunction of both parathyroid glands and thymus, we are reporting it. Method: Autopsy. Results: Female (small height), dead at 22 years of age in cerebral coma. Clinical symptoms were polymorphous and complex: recurrent viral and fungal infections, amenorrhea, parestesias, acches and cramps affecting legs, feet, abdomen and face, as well as the headaches and depression. The clinical diagnosis was idiopathic epylepsy. Two months before her death, both ionized serun calcium concentration (1.1 mg / dL) and the parathormone (9 pg / mL) were decreased. She was in a coma for 1 week and has died from muscular tetany. Autopsy finding: fibrosis of the parathyroid gland and thymus remnants, diffuse brain liquefactive necrosis, myocardial and ovarian fibrosis were found. Conclusion: The authors have suggested out that the increased neuromuscular excitability is related to the decreased serum ionized calcium and that the recidivant viral and fungal infections were induced by the decreased thymus gland function, in other words by \"Partial\" DeGeorge syndrome.",

            "text": "Comparative assessement of hormone immunoprofile between pituitary adenomas coming from Romania and Republic of Moldova Objective: To compare the immunoprofile of pituitary adenomas from Romania and Moldova and to highlight similarities and differences regarding hormone profile between two regions. Method: Group 1 included 94 cases coming from Romania and group 2 was composed of 86 cases collected from Republic of Moldova. Specimens were assessed by immunhistochemistry regarding all six hormones expressed in pituitary adenomas. An accurate statistic analysis has been performed. Results: For group 1, 70 % of cases showed positivity for one hormone, 13 % were plurihormonal, while 17 % were negative. For group 2, 50,3 % of the cases expressed only one hormone and 12,5 % were negative for all hormones. The highest difference was observed for plurihormonal adenomas, found in about 37,2 % of cases for group 2 (2.86 times higher for group 2 compared with group 1). GH-secreting adenomas characterized group \"1\", while group \"2\" had the highest percent of LH secreting adenomas, 55 % of cases being positive. Triple association was noticed in 4.25 % of cases of group 1 and in 8,13 % out of total cases, from group 2. Four hormones association was found in 15,56 % of the cases, exclusively for group 2. Objective: Actin cytoskeleton dynamics are critically implicated in cancer invasion and metastases. Actin-binding proteins cortactin, NWASP and WIP regulate actin assembly and reorganization during cell migration and invasion into the extracellular matrices. Altered expressions of these proteins have been implicated in human malignancies. This study addresses their role in ameloblastoma of the jaws. Method: 87 paraffin-embedded ameloblastoma cases (20 unicystic, 47 solid/multicystic, 3 desmoplastic and 17 recurrent) were subjected to immunohistochemistry for expression of cortactin, NWASP and WIP. Results: Cortactin (n = 73/87; 83.9 %), NWASP (n = 59/87; 67.8 %) and WIP (n = 77/87; 88.5 %) were heterogeneously expressed in ameloblastoma. Cortactin which functions as a scaffold for actin, demonstrated significantly higher expression levels in ameloblastomas from male patients. NWASP which mediates actin polymerization, was significantly elevated in the solid/multicystic subtype (p < 0.05). Age, ethnic and site showed no significant correlations. Conclusion: Overexpression of cortactin and NWASP may be implicated in ameloblastoma tumourigenesis. Their enhanced expressions seem to favor ameloblastoma subtypes with a more aggressive clinical behavior. Objective: Intraparotid Facial nerve Schwannomas (FNS) are benign tumours that originate from Schwann cells, with a slow and predictable growth. FNS arise from either the extratemporal or intratemporal course of this nerve. Most of these tumours are intratemporal, whereas 9 % are located extracranially and usually appear as an asymptomatic parotid mass. Hence, it is difficult to establish a correct preopera-tive diagnosis. Although most patients do not present with facial nerve palsy, it is important to suggest this diagnosis preoperatively because post-operative facial nerve paresis or palsy is common, and these patients can be better informed of this complication before surgery. Method: A 29-year-old woman, presented with gradually increasing mass in the parotid right region for several months of evolution. MR imaging showed a well-circumscribed lesion (2.0 \u00d7 1.5 cm.) in the upper right parotid gland. Fine needle aspiration cytology was suggestive of pleomorphic adenoma. The tumour was excised, trying to preserve the integrity of the nerve. The pathological diagnosis of the surgical piece disclosed a benign Schwannoma. The patient had a facial paralysis in the postoperative period. Results: The tumour was histopathologically diagnosed as intraparotid facial nerve schwannoma (S100+). Conclusion: -FNS is a very rare, benign tumour mimicking pleomorphic adenoma. Accounting for only 0.2-1.5 % of all parotid tumours. -FNS though rare should be also considered in the differential diagnoses of the slowly enlarging parotid swellings. -It is very difficult to preoperatively diagnose because it rarely produces any signs and symptoms. Objective: To study the expression of CD117, C-erbB2 and its relationship with cell proliferation in head and neck and lung squamous cell carcinomas. Method: Expression of CD117 and C-erbB2 were detected with immunohistochemical staining in 32 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (including skin, tongue, larynx) samples and 6 lung squamous cell carcinomas samples. Results: Statistically significant positive relationships were found between C-erbB-2 and tumour differentiation (P < 0,05). There was a significant correlation between C-erbB-2 and staining pattern (P < 0,05). There was a significant correlation between localization and tumour differentiation (P < 0,05). There was not a significant correlation between CD117 and C-erbB2 (P = 0,426). There was not a significant correlation between CD117 and localization and tumour differentiation (respectively: P = 0,713, P = 0,181). Objective: CD117, C-erbB2 receptors participate in the pathologic process including tissue remodeling of inflammatory diseases in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. This study aimed at investigating the expressions of CD117, C-erbB2 protein in the nasal mucosa of nasal polyps. Method: This study was conducted on a total of 77 paraffin-embedded nasal polyp samples. The expressions of CD117, C-erbB2 were examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Statistically significant positive relationships were found between C-erbB2 and localization (p = 0,050). Significant positive relationships were found between staining patern and localization (p = 0,045). Significant positive relationships were not find between CD117 and CErbB2 (p = 0,153) and localization (p = 0,078). Conclusion: C-erbB2 was showed relationship localization and staining patern. In addition to, it can not relationship between C-erbB2 and CD117 in this study. Method: In this study anti-human bcl-2 antibody and Ki-67 that is reactive in formalin-fixed tissues was used with an avidinbiotin complex immunoperoxidase method to evaluate 18 cases of chronic sialadenitis. It was evaluated acinar, ductal glands and epimyoepithelial islands. Results: Statistically significant positive relationships were found between Bcl-2 positivity in acinar glands and Ki-67 positivity in ductal glands (P = 0,016). Significant positive relationships were found between Ki-67 positivity in ductal glands and Ki-67 positivity in acinar glands (p = 0,010). Significant positive relationships were found between Bcl-2 positivity in ductal glands and Bcl-2 positivity in epimyoepithelial islands (p = 0,016). Significant positive relationships were found between Bcl-2 positivity in ductal glands and Ki-67positivity in epimyoepithelial islands (p = 0,017). Conclusion: Bcl-2 positivity and ki-67 index showed positive correlation of acinar, ductal glands and epimyoepithelial islands in this study.",

            "text": "Objective: Olfactory neuroblastoma (OAN) is an extremely rare malignant neoplasm of the nasal cavity, peripherial primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET) are also rare in head and neck region. It is a great challenge to differentiate these two entities solely on the basis of pathohistology and cytological characteristics of tumour cells. Method: We report the case of a 52 years old man who presented with a 27 years history of olfactory neuroblastoma of right nasal cavity with infiltration of the base of the skull, epipharynx, right orbit and frontal sinus. The patient went under radiotherapy. There was no sign of significant regression in 1988. Until 2014 he had no medical treatment, when he was rehospitalized with metastatic tumours in the right lung. We used cytology and immunocytochemistry for further examination. Results: Tumour cells showed strong positive reaction for CD99 (> 90 % tumour cells). This result changed the diagnosis to PNET. Conclusion: Besides the interesting fact of the long period of no progression and no dissemination of the primary disease, in this article we focus on the recognition that small blue round cell tumours cannot be differential diagnosed with certainty without immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry. 14 % of cancers (represented by N/K lymphoma) . The average age of all cases was 46, 5 years with male predominance. The average age of cases carrying sinonasal cancers was 50 years and the average age of patients with benign tumours was 25 years. The consultation period averaged 18 months. Nasal obstruction and rhinorhea were the predominant signs. Thirty four of patients underwent CT scan, which finded an hyperdense lesion in 9 %, an hypodense lesion in 6 % and osteolysis in 9 %. Treatment was curative in 95 % of cases. The mean of our patients was 03 years. We noted a good outcome in 39 patients, reccurences in 08 patients, and abdominal metastasis in a patient. Four patients were died. Conclusion: Sinonasal tumours are rare and pose many difficulties both in etiology, diagnostic and therapeutic.",

Herein, we report a case of non-invasive carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (Ca-ex-PA) that occurred in the lateral parapharyngeal space. Method: A 35-year-old man presented with a clinical diagnosis of a benign salivary gland mass located in the region of the right parapharyngeal space measuring 5.5 \u00d7 5 cm. Results: The macroscopic appearance of the resected specimen was solid and completely encapsulated. Histopathological examination revealed a tumour almost completely consisting of a typical pleomorphic adenoma as well as some more cellular areas with duct-like structure and cell-rich mesenchymal tissues. The cellular component was characterized by nuclear atypia and a high mitotic rate. Immunohistochemically these areas were positive for S-100p, anti-p53, AR and HER2neu (3+). Based on these findings, a final diagnosis of adenocarcinoma NOS ex pleomorphic adenoma was made. Additional treatments were not performed because there were no evidences of capsule invasion and metastasis. Patient adapted a \"wait-and-see\" approach. Conclusion: Ca-ex-PA of the parapharyngeal space is extremely rare and frequently misdiagnosed. Occasionally, extensive sampling is necessary to find the malignant component and rarely a benign remnant might not be found. HER2neu overexpression is helpful both for the diagnosis and any potential clinical management.",

Kyriakopoulos, C. Vourlakou * Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece Objective: Salivary gland neoplasms composed exclusively or predominantly of myoepithelial cells are relatively uncommon. Herein we report a case of a myoepithelial carcinoma arising in a pleomorphic adenoma (PA) with subsequent lung metastasis. Method: A 47-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of a painless swelling of the left lateral pharyngeal space. The initial tumour was a PA. Four months later she complained for a chest pain. CT revealed multiple parenchymal lung nodules. Multiple biopsies were performed. Results: Histological examination showed a malignant biphasic neoplasm composed of spindle cells with clear cytoplasm, a high mitotic rate and an infiltrative growth pattern in a background of a prominently myxoid stroma. Immunophenotypically tumour cells stained positively with anti-cytokeratin antibodies, S-100 protein, a-SMA, p63, Vimentin and anti-p53 (> 50 %). Conclusion: Myoepithelial carcinoma may occasionally develop in a pre-existing PA but most often arises de novo. The immunophenotype was characteristic: tumour cells were immunoreactive with antibodies of myoepithelial differentiation. However, the combination of nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity was considered sufficient to justify the designation of myoepithelial carcinoma. To establish wherever a myoepithelial carcinoma has arisen in a PA may require microscopic examination of the entire tumour in order to demonstrate a small residual focus of pleomorphic adenoma. Objective: KOT is a tumour development with defined histoclinical characteristics that distinguishes them from other odontogenic cysts: Destructive behavior, risk of recurrence, association with Gorlin syndrome (GS), possible malignant transformation. There is considerable controversy regarding its management. The Objective is to determine prognostic factors for recurrence after simple enucleation by clinicopathological criteria. Method: Retrospective study in our hospital during 2000-2003. We analyzed: localization, GS association, structure, cortical perforation, associated tooth, keratinization type, dysplasia, inflammatory component, cysts satellites, enucleation type, Ki67. Results: Total 17 KOT: 35.3 % of recurrence after enucleation without adjuvant treatment. Mean follow-up period: 77.4 months. Mean time to recurrence: 64.9 months. We detect strong relationship between cortical perforation and the risk of recurrence (66.7 %). Others potential risk factors: associationGS (66.7 %recurrence), multilocular structure (33.3 %recurrence/18.2 %no-recurrence) and the presence of inclusion of the wisdom tooth (33.3 %recurrence/9 %no-recurrence). Factors such as degree of inflammation, cysts satellites, fragmented enucleation and Ki67 dont showed relationship. In no event shall observe dysplasia. Conclusion: Essential to recognize the KOT histologically. Enucleation alone has demonstrated acceptable results with low morbidity in comparison with other more aggressive techniques. However, in cases with increased risk of recurrence such as multilocular cyst, cortical perforation and association with GS, could be indicated adjuvant therapy or more aggresive treatment. Objective: In thyroid diseases, frozen section diagnosis is challenging but mandatory. The objective of this study was to compare the results of frozen section diagnosis and definitive histologic results and to propose ways to improve the performance of frozen section examination in thyroid lesions. Method: We undertook a retrospective study in pathology department of the Military Hospital of Tunis including 490 patients undergoing thyroid surgery in a 5-year period (January 2008 to December 2012). We compared their frozen section examinations and the definitive histologic results. Results: The frozen section diagnosis had a sensitivity of 61,1 % and a specificity of 100 %. The positive predictive value was 100 % while the negative predictive value was 97 %. The concordance was 74,4 %. The disconcordance, which was 25,6 %, was due to 12 false negative cases (2, 44 % of all cases), including 6 micropapillay carcinomas and 6 follicular variants of papillary carcinoma. Conclusion: Frozen section is appropriate in deciding the extent of thyroidectomy in thyroid neoplasms. To improve its reliability, it is recommended to associate preoperative cytologic examination of samples. In addition, a closer collaboration between surgeons and pathologists is necessary.",

Results: During the internal examination of the body at the entrance of the larynx a pedunculated tumour formation was observed. It was obliterating completely the upper air ways. The histological examination revealed the tumour was a laryngeal polyp. The toxicological analysis was negative. Death was attributed to acute obstruction caused by the laryngeal polyp which led to mechanical asphyxia. Conclusion: Laryngeal polyps rarely present with airway obstruction. This case shows the importance of a complete and thorough analysis of every patient with proper, on time diagnosis in order to avoid such complications. Objective: Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant smooth muscle tumour, which is most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract, uterus and retroperitoneum. It is uncommon in the upper respiratory tract and even more rare in the nasal cavity. In the sinonasal tract, leiomyosarcoma is considered to be derived from smooth muscle of the vascular wall. Method: We report a rare case of leiomyosarcoma arising in the nasal cavity. Results: A 53-year-old woman sought treatment for nasal obstruction and facial pain. An endoscopic examination and computed tomography revealed a mass involving the posterior area of the right nasal cavity. The lesion was completely excised with adequate margins of uninvolved tissue. Macroscopically the surgical specimen consisted of two pieces of pale, gray, solid tissues measuring 35 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 30 mm. Section of the biopsy specimen stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed interlacing fascicles of highly atypical spindle shaped cells that have eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated, blunt-ended hyperhromatic nuclei with frequent mitoses. The tumour cells were strongly immunoreactive for smooth muscle actin and h-Caldesmon. There was no immunoreactivity for S-100. Conclusion: Leiomyosarcoma is an exceptional rare malignant tumour of the nasal cavity with no more than 20 cases reported so far, but the diagnosis is usually straightforward.",

This work highlights the different macroscopic and microsopic aspects of this recent pathological entity. Method: Twelve osteoporotic patients (9 F, 3 M, average age: 72 years old) who received bisphosphonate came to our attention showing intraoral necrotic bone exposure around dental implants diagnosed as PI-BRONJ of different stages. All the affected sites underwent wide enblock surgical excision comprehending both bone and implants, with subsequent histological analysis. Results: Macroscopically, we distinguished: \"type 1\" PI-BRONJ comprehending osteolytic forms with extensive osteolysis and inflammatory cell infiltration around implant fixtures that are also subdivided depending on the partial or total loss of implant osteointegration; \"type 2\" PI-BRONJ comprehending non-osteolytic forms with alveolar bone necrosis distant from implant fixture which is still well-osteointegrated. Microscopically, the histological examination of the decalcified and undecalcified samples highlighted areas of bone necrosis with large osteons and empty osteocytic lacunae, small and irregular Haversian canals, inflammatory cell infiltration and basophilic actinomyces-like bacterial colonies. The medullary spaces were replaced by fibrous connective tissue. Conclusion: PI-BRONJ is a recent bisphosphonates complication that has to be taken into consideration by pathologists and dental practitioners. Objective: The correct diagnosis of this benign odontogenic tumour, with its histological very atypical cellularity, mimicking a malignancy, could be easier by CLSM, with the early detection of the laser induced fluorescence of the micro-deposits of amyloid. Method: Sixteen patients (mean age 31 years) reported from 1990 to 2014, underwent Rx-OPT, CAT-Scan, pre-operative FNAB and biopsy with histopathological analysis by optical and CLSM using standard stained slides (HE, Congo red). Results: Rx revealed large (>4 cm) multilocular disomogeneous lesions with calcifications localized in mandibular angular region (13) and in posterior maxilla (3). Optical microscopy showed islands of atypical and dysplastic large epithelial cells with prominent intercellular bridges, suggestive for malignancy, surrounded by hyaline matrix and micro-calcifications. CLSM analysis revealed a strong red and green fluorescence localized mainly in spotty intra and extracellular localization constituted by small deposits of amyloid fibers, pathognomonic of this odontogenic benign tumour. Conclusion: CLSM despite polarizing microscope and other techniques is more accurate and detailed to detect small and intracellular amounts of amyloid fibers and micro-calcifications, typical of this atypical and rare odontogenic tumour, allowing conservative surgical therapy. Objective: MEC is a malignant tumour of salivary glands; on the basis of his histological prognostic scoring systems, 24 cases of MEC of minor salivary glands of the palate, treated between 1988 and 2008 were divided into low-grade (local recurrence) and high-grade types (nodal and distant metastasis) and clinicopathological and prognostic correlations for this single localization were recorded. Method: 24 patients affected by intraoral palatal MEC (mean 25 years, 60 %female) underwent spiral CT and MRI, preoperative FNAB and biopsy and were classified into 18 cysticlow-grade and 6 solid high-grade, treated with wide surgical excision with 5 years of follow-up. Results: Low-grade MEC present bluish-red, fixed nodules (mean 3 cm) with bone depression and cooping with well defined osteolytic areas. High-grade MEC present ulcerated vascular eso-endophytic nodular growth (3-6 cm) with underlying bone and sinus infiltration with indefinite margins; one patient had a local recurrence. Local metastasis were not detected. Conclusion: MEC with palatal localization, is mainly low grade without recurrences when dimensional range is 1-3 cm; high grade palatal MEC with larger extension (3-6 cm) is locally aggressive but seems to have a better prognosis, with lower recurrence rates and metastasis respect to MEC of other minor and major salivary glands localizations. Objective: Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid carcinoma with apparently no benign neoplastic counterpart. Primary C-cell hyperplasia is mostly associated with MEN2, being considered the precursor lesion for medullary thyroid carcinoma. Secondary C-cell hyperplasia has been observed in the immediate periphery of nonmedullary thyroid neoplasms, in association with Hashimoto thyroiditis, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemic states and after partial removal of the thyroid. Method: We report a 74-year-old female with no family history of MEN2, presenting with a 2.8 cm painless nodule in the left thyroid lobe and slightly elevated calcitonin levels. The nodule was surgically removed and the intraoperatory diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma concluded that a complete thyroidectomy was necessary.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Secondary C-cell hyperplasia has been described in association with various pathophysiologic conditions or adjacent to follicular tumours. We consider this incidental finding particularly interesting because C-cell hyperplasia occured within nonneoplastic thyroid tissue and in a completely different area than the coexisting papillary thyroid carcinoma. Method: A 60-year-old man presented with a mass lesion located in palate and right maxillary sinus. On gross examination, there was a firm mass measuring 6.5 \u00d7 4.5 cm (moderately advanced local disease) with extensive bone destruction. Results: Microscopically, the tumour cells were arranged in solid cell nests, trabeculae or cords surrounded by a prominent hyalinized stroma. The majority of cells were round to polygonal with clear cytoplasm. There was another population of smaller cells with plump nuclei and granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Both populations lacked nuclear pleomorphism and mitoses. Immunohistochemically the tumour cells were focally or diffusely positive for EMA, CK5/6, CK7, CK14, CAM5.2 and invariably negative for S100, SMA, MSA, and GFAP, ruling out myoepithelial differentiation. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) break-apart assay for the EWSR1 gene rearrangement revealed that our case was positive, confirming the diagnosis of HCCC. Conclusion: This carcinoma harbors a recurrent and consistent EWSR1/ ATF1 fusion, which links this tumour to clear cell odontogenic carcinoma, and is not present in other clear cell mimics, which are involved in the differential diagnosis. HCCC demonstrates a squamous line of differentiation without myoepithelial marker expression. Objective: Dendritic Cell Neoplasms (DCN) are rare tumours that previously were classified as lymphomas, sarcomas or histiocytic neoplasms. Currently the WHO classifies DCNs into five distinct entities: a) Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, b) Langerhans' cell sarcoma, c) Interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma/tumour, d) Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma/tumour and e) Dendritic cell sarcoma, not otherwise specified. Method: A 79-year old male patient admitted to our hospital with a cervical enlargement. We received a surgical specimen of a lymph node, m.d.: 2 cm, which on cut was whitish in hue and had a hard consistency. We performed an immunohistochemical evaluation with the following: LCA, CD20, CD3, \u03ba and \u03bb light chains, EMA, AE1/AE3, CD1a, FVIII, Desmin, CD21, CD4, CD8, CD68, bcl2, bcl6, MPO, S100, CD30, CD23, CD35, Vimentin and EBV. Results: Histologically the lymph node architecture was completely destroyed and it was invaded by medium to large size neoplastic cells with cytoplasmic extensions with mainly a nodular pattern of growth. We noted increase number of mitoses with increased mitotic rate (ki67: >50 %) and dispersed multinuclear giant cells. The cells reacted against the CD21, CD23 and focally for EMA. Objective: We propose to highlights the value of using immunostaining to localize both the ACTH and calcitonin within the same cells in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Method: A case of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland that secreted adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) is reported.",

            "text": "The patient was a 54-year-old man who consulted for Cushing's syndrome and chest pain. Radiologic stain showed cervical and intrathoracic masses. Serum levels of calcitonin and ACTH were elevated. The thoracic and cervical masses were resected. The histologic findings were typical of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The neoplasm had a predominantly solid pattern, and the neoplastic cells were either round or spindled, many with cytologic atypia. Immunohistochemical analysis showed chromogranin, calcitonin, and ACTH in the neoplastic cells. The immunostaining for chromogranin was intense in all of the cells, whereas weaker staining for calcitonin and ACTH was present in scattered cells. Thus, the medullary carcinoma of the thyroid in this patient was the source of ectopic ACTH secretion causing Cushing's syndrome. Conclusion: Medullary thyroid carcinoma rarely causes paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome. Immunostaining is important for the diagnosis. Objective: The clinical, imaging, and pathologic features of this neoplasm are discussed, with potential treatment options. Method: We report a case of extramedullary plasmocytoma of the larynx in patient with long-standing Ig D myeloma. Results: A 55-year-old man with long standing Ig D myeloma presented with dry cough and breathlessness for last 6 months. Direct laryngoscopic examination showed a gray-white submucosal mass in the subglottic region. Histopathological examination showed presence of pseudostratified columnar epithelium with underlying stroma having mature and immature plasma cells. The cells were mono to bi-nucleated having eccentric nuclei and condensed spoke like chromatin. Few cells had centrally placed nuclei with small but conspicuous nucleoli. These cells were positive to CD138. The patient was successfully treated with primary radical radiotherapy and showed no signs of local recurrence after 4 years follow-up. Conclusion: Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the larynx is a rare disease, highly curable when radiotherapy is used.",

Tetik * Istanbul, Turkey Abstract: Background: Nasal angioleiomyoma is a very rare entity which occurs only in less than 1 % of all leiomyoma cases. It has been postulated that they orginate from either undifferentiated mesenchyme or muscular layer of vessels or both. They grow slowly and may persist for a long time. Patients present most commonly with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, facial pain or headache. Treatment of choice is generally local resection. Recurrence is not common. Case: A 62 year-old male complaining of frequent epistaxis presented with a polypoid mass of 2 cm diameter in his right nasal cavity. MRI revealed the vascular nature of the lesion. Pathological examination showed polypoid fragments of nasal mucosa covering a tumour composed of numerous thickened vessels with an iner coat of circumferentially arranged spindle cells. The tumour cells had plump to elongated nuclei and eosinophillic fibrillary cytoplasm. They were immunopositive for smooth muscle actin(SMA) and demsin. Via these features, it was reported as angioleiomyoma.

            "text": "Abstract: Benign tumours of the tonsils are rare. Only a few cases of tonsillar lipoma have been previously reported. Although lipomas are discovered incidentally they can present as cough, foreign body sensation, voice change, airway obstruction, even angina and positional sleep apnea. A case of polypoid lipoma of anterior plica of the palatine tonsil in a 23-year-old male is presented. The polyp was excised. Histological examination showed lobulated adipose tissue with very rich vascular channels in the collagenous septa around the lobules. The vascular channels are immunopositive for CD34 and Factor 8. According to the morphological findings and immunohistochemical staining, it was diagnosed as angiolipoma. We may therefore conclude that angiolipoma of tonsil is a very rare neo\u00acplasm that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of tonsillary tumours. Abstract: In this article a 50 year-old male patient complaining of postnasal drip and nasal obstruction for 10 years is presented. Granular cell tumours are benign relatively rare lesions that can occur in any organ in the body. The most common sites of origin are the head and neck, while the vocal cord is a relatively uncommon location. The most common symptoms are hoarseness and airway obstruction. Histopathologically, it is a non-encapsulated tumour with poorly defined margins and is composed of sheets, cords, or nests of cells. Tumour cells are large and polygonal with abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and small vesicular nuclei. The cytoplasmic granules stain positive for periodic acid Schiff. The tumour cells show positivity with S-100, neuron-specific enolase, CD68 and negativity with CK, HMB45. Eosinophilic granules are also strongly positive for the PAS reaction. Eventually it was diagnosed as the granular cell tumour located on the vocal cords. Granular cell tumours are resistant to radiotherapy in contrast to surgical excision which is very successful for the treatment. We may therefore conclude that granular cell tumours are rare neo-plasms that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of laryngeal tumours.",

The tumour cells were uniform, spindle-shaped with oval nuclei, accompanied by an inflammatory cell infiltrate including eosinophils. \"Stag horn\" vessels, as typical for hemangiopericytoma, were identified as well as focal nuclear atypia. Immunohistochemistry revealed a strong staining pattern to vimentin but no reaction with actin.",

Method: We aimed to report characteristics of 6 cases of thyroid benign nodules with angioma-like lesions. Results: Angioma-like lesions in thyroid nodules were detected in 6 cases. The gender ratio was 2:4 (man:woman), the age ranged 61-82 years. The clinical diagnoses were thyroid nodular goiter and thyroid nodule. FNAC was performed in 2 cases. Contrast substance injection for thyroid imaging was performed in 4 cases. Prothrombin-time and cephalin-activated ratio were abnormal in 2 cases. Treatment consisted in total thyroidectomy (4) and right lobe resection (2). Microscopic analysis revealed sporadic nodular goiter (5, out of 236 thyroidectomies for goiter) and adenoma (1). The patients' history showed chemotherapy (for surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma) and sandostatin treatment (pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma) (one case each); arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes and cardiac stent procedure (5,3,1 and 1 case respectively). Thyroid angioma-like lesions/aggregates (1-12/thyroid specimen) were intranodular (hyperplastic adenoma-type nodule in goiter and adenoma) and, measured 1-10 mm, (quasi-entire thyroid specimen analyzed microscopically). Vascular parietal, non-obliterating foam-cell-dots were seen in these lesions, along with rare 2-5 macrophage thick sheets (6 and 2 cases, respectively). Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that thyroid angioma-like lesions may occur in thyroid adenoma or adenoma-like hyperplastic nodules in goiter, independently from FNAC procedures. Foam-cell-dots may be seen in the vascular wall suggesting a relationship to patients' history (dyslipidemia, contrast substance injection, clotting disorder).",

Koletsa * University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Dept. of Forensic Medicine, Timisoara, Romania Objective: We studied the occurrence of primary brain trauma and secondary cerebral oedema and each of them intervention to produce death. Method: We reviewed the cases with cranio-cerebral trauma (total 262 autopsied between 2012 and 2014) with cranio-cerebral trauma, with secondary cerebral edema that occurred. Results: We met skull fractures in 84 % of cases, associated with meningeal lesions, cerebral trauma with other sites, which occurred after traumatic cerebral oedema. The time period between trauma and secondary cerebral edema aged from a few hours to 18 days. Locating brain trauma was at the time, front, parietal, basal occcipital and diffuse. In 23 % of cases we found fibrosis of intracerebral vessels. The most common circumstances were falls, traffic accidents, accidents at work, or risk sports. Conclusion: Evolution to worsening of the posttraumatic secondary cerebral oedema or fatal complications due to pre-existing factors require caution in forensic assessment. In arguing contribution to death proces of secondary cerebral oedema has an essential role ruling out other causes of death. Objective: Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) is an uncommon tumour accounting for 0,4 % of malignant salivary gland tumours. It is an undifferentiated carcinoma accompanied by a prominent non-neoplastic lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. It displays identical histologic features to nonkeratinizing undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method: A 41 year old man presented with right parotid, slowly enlarging, painless, non-tender mass of 5 months duration. Physical examination of the right parotid gland revealed a firm, semi-mobile mass measuring 3 cm in maximum dimension. Ultrasound revealed a well defined homogenous mass measuring 3,3 \u00d7 1,6 cm in the superficial lobe of the right parotid gland and enlarged lymph nodes. Physical and radiologic examination of the nasal-oral cavity and nasopharynx were in normal limits. Results: Fine needle aspiration cytology showed dispersed single atypical cells in a lymphoid background. Total parotidectomy and right neck disection was performed. Microscopically, solid carcinomatous sheets, trabeculae and isolated small groups of syncitial-appearing large tumour cells with scant amphophilic cytoplasm and vesicular haphazardly arranged nuclei intermingled with lymphoid tissue and surrounded by salivary gland were observed. A diagnosis of primary LEC of the parotid gland was made. Conclusion: We herein present the clinicopathologic features of primary LEC of the parotid gland with review of the literarure. Objective: Thyroid neoplasms consisting of clear cells are rare and prone to pose severe diagnostic challenges. The aim of this study was to differentiate between a primary nodule and a metastatic clear-cell tumour mainly a clear-cell renal carcinoma. Method: We retrospectively reviewed two cases with pathologically diagnosed clear-cell tumour in 2014 at the pathology department of the Rabta hospital. The first case had a metastatic clear-cell renal carcinoma and the second case had a clear-cell adenoma. Results: They were respectively a 80 year-old man and a 55-year-old woman who presented with a thyroid swelling. Macroscopic examination of the resected specimens revealed a solid well circumscribed nodule. Microscopic examination revealed solid areas composed of large polygonal cells with a pale cytoplasm and hyperchromic nuclei in the first case. In the second case, the tumour had a follicular growth but was cytologically similar. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the clear cells to stain positive for CD10 and negative for thyroglobulin in the first case. Neoplastic cells were immunonegative for CD 10 and positive for TTF1 and Thyroglobulin in the second case. Conclusion: The patient's history of kidney disorders as well as careful microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations are essential to diagnose clear-cell renal carcinoma.",

Vuckovic Objective: Female age 73 with ulcerative pigmented lesion at nasal floor suspected for haemangioma. Fragmented material contained invasive mucosal melanoma with ulceration in stage I of disease and positive margins. Three years after she went radical excision of recidive melanoma that infiltrate the inferior nasal concha and Melanoma in situ mucosae on the nasal floor and both middle nasal conchas and margine to the upper nasal wall. The nasal floor mucosa was negative from tumour so as the margin to the rest of the septum. Regional lymph nodes (19) at right cervical region were negative. Method: To confirm melanocytic origine of tumour cells samples were screened for Melan A and HMWCK34\u03b2E12. Results: Inadequate resection lead to 3 years disease-free period and local recidive after. Immunohistochemistry confirmed surface expression of melanoma cells and infiltrative growth into submucosa. Conclusion: Despite the expectation that surgical excision should spare tissue in the head and neck region, it is important that intervention is sufficient and margines are negative from tumour. Careful and minute specialist examination are required in already inaccessible localization. Each incidence pigment change should be radically removed, knowing that 30 % of all melanomas in this region are unpigmented ones. Objective: We aimed to investigate whether immunohistochemistry (HBME-1, cytokeratin-19/calcitonin and chromogranin in medullary carcinoma) provides additional information concerning the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. Method: It was a retrospective study about 210 nodules of thyroid which were collected over 3 years (2010-2012) in our hospital. Twelve cases (5.71 %) were difficult to diagnose. We performed an immunohistochemical analysis on these 12 cases. Eleven follicular tumours were difficult to interpret. The antibodies used were HMBE-1 and cytokeratin 19. The last case was suspected to be a medullary carcinoma and we used chromgranin and calcitonin. Results: In 11 follicular tumours, 10 cases expressed HMBE-1 and CK 19 so we retained the diagnostic of papillary carcinoma in its follicular variant. The stain was negative for CK19 and HMBE-1 in one case so we conclude in follicular carcinoma. The last case was stained with calcitonin and chromogranin which confirmed the diagnosis of medullary carcinoma. In all cases, immunohistochemistry has permitted the diagnosis and has specified the histologic subtype. Conclusion: In our study, Immunohistochemistry has contributed in the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma with difficult interpretation. But morphological features should always prime in the diagnostic decision.",

Method: We selected 123 cases, which were diagnosed as \"basaloid squamous cell carcinoma\" and \"poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma\" from a pathological file of our hospital during 2002-2015, and we re-estimated these cases, according to the diagnostic criteria of pulmonary LCNEC. We examined them on neuroendocrine (NE) markers; CD56, chromogranin-A, and synaptophysin, immunohistochemically, and we re-diagnosed the cases, in which two or three NE markers are immunopositive, as M-LCNEC. We examined the clinicopathological characteristics of M-LCNEC. Results: Twelve cases (9.8 %) were extracted. All cases are male and the mean age is 63.5 year-old (range 44-75 year-old). The primary sites are at the lingual root (3 cases), larynx (5 cases), maxillary sinus (2 cases), hypopharynx (1 case), and nasal cavity (1 case). Five cases are dead. Histologically, the tumour cells showed large nests formation with the central necrosis, rosette formation and/or nuclear palisading at the periphery of the nests. The immunestochemistry indicated that the tumour cells are frequently positive for NE markers. High Ki-67 labeling index (>78 %) was seen. A few of immunestivity for p63 were infrequently seen. Conclusion: M-LCNEC of the head and neck regions is an extremely rare and established entity. Although M-LCNEC sometimes accompanies squamous differentiation, p63 imminopositive rate trends to reduce with prominent NE differentiation. Objective: Carcinomas originating from mucous glands of the larynx represent less than 1 % of all laryngeal cancers. Most of the minor salivary gland tumours arise in the subglottis; however, they can also occur in the supraglottis, in the false vocal cords, aryepiglottic folds and caudal portion of the epiglottis. It is commonly confined to the submucosa with no involvement of the surface epithelium. Method: 5 cases the salivary gland type carcinoma of larynx were evaluated. Results: All of the patients were males and their ages ranged between the 58-79 years old. The diagnosis of three cases were mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and the two others were adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). The tumour is localized to subglottic area in one case diagnosed as ACC. In the other ACC, tumour is limited to the left aryepiglottic fold.In two cases diagnosed as MEC tumour is spreaded from left cord vocale through the epiglottis. And the last one, tumour is localized to the anteriory commissure. Immunuhistochemically all cases shown positive for PanCK, p63 and four cases positive for Alcian Blue.",

Immunohistochemical study with markers CD 20, CD 3, Bcl2, Bcl6, showed normal distribution of B and T cell lymphocytes. No evidence of malignancy was seen. The diagnosis was benign lymphoepithelial cyst. Conclusion: According to literature 90 % of lymphoepithelial cysts were lined by squamous epithelium. However there were also reported cases where the cysts were lined by respiratory epithelium, columnar or cuboidal epithelium. The pathologist must differentiate it from Warthin tumour, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, sialolithiasis and malignancies. Objective: Our aim is to review cases of odontogenic tumours in order to study their pathological features. Method: Our retrospective study of 12 cases is based on the classification of the World Health Organization in 2005, over a 12 years period collected in the department of pathology of the Military Hospital of Tunis. Results: The mean age of our patients was 36,9 years. The sex ratio was 2,2. Functional signs were dominated mainly by swelling. Four patients underwent a computed tomography scan which identified a hyperdense lesion in 2 cases and hypodense lesion in 1 case and a filling defect in 1 case. Microscopic examination showed 8 keratocysts, 1 dentigerous cyst, 1 ameloblastoma, 1 complex odontoma and 1 odontogenic fibroma. The treatment was surgical in all patients. Complete tumour resection was performed on 10 patients. The recurrence occurred in 2 patients. Conclusion: Due to the diversity of ondontogenic tumours, the diagnosis is often difficult. The diagnosis approach of the pathologist must be based on clinical data to establish diagnostic hypotheses and morphological features. Objective: The objective of this study was correlate the tumoural CoCl2induced hypoxia assessed by HIF-1, CAIX and GLUT1 with expression of adhesion molecules CD44 and CD24 in salivary gland carcinoma cell line. Method: The effect of CoCl2-induced hypoxia on the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, GLUT1, CAIX, CD44 and CD24 was assessed in salivary gland carcinoma cell line (HTB-41) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Results: The present data showed that CoCl2-induced hypoxia upregulated the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and influenced pH regulation and glucose intake by up-regulating the expression of CA-IX and Glut-1. We observed that 50 uM or 150 uM of CoCl2 was capable to influences CD44 and CD24 mRNA enhancing, however, protein expression of CD44 and CD24 at 50 uM was unchanged and was drastically reduced at 150 uM CoCl2 concentration. Conclusion: Together, present data suggested that hypoxic mimetic microenvironment could induce HIF-1\u03b1 up-regulation, changes in pH regulation and glucose intake. In addition, a reduction on CD44 and CD24 expression in HTB-41 cell lineage with increased CoCl2 concentration was observed; it might be related with cellular decrease protein synthesis capability. Objective: This study reports on the morphologic and immunophenotypic features of clear cell odontogenic carcinomas (CCOC) occuring in the mandible of young woman, showing extensive infiltration into adjacent tissues. CCOC is an extremely rare neoplasm and so far only 75 cases have been reported in the English-language literature. Method: The tumour presented a monophasic pattern composed entirely of clear cell nests separated by cellular collagenous stroma. There was no evidence of ameloblastic differentiation. Most tumour cells contained PAS positive, diastase sensitive glycogen granules. The reports on immunohistochemical findings of CCOC have been inconsistent. This case was immunoreactive for known neuroectodermal markers-CD99(O13), NSE and CD56. Positivity for Vimentin, AE1/AE3, CK7 and EMA was also seen. Results: To the authors' knowledge CD99(O13) has not been investigated previously in CCOC. Identification of the CD99 and other neuroectodermal markers positivity may prove to be useful in differentiating it from other odontogenic tumours, and salivary gland hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma(HCCC). Additionally, High labeling indices for the proliferation markers K\u0130-67 and to p53 might predict a unfavorable prognosis for the case. Conclusion: A surgical resection was performed, subsequently adjuvant radiotherapy was given. The patient was free of recurrence at 9 months follow-up. Method: It is a retrospective study about 14 cases of non odontogenic facial bones tumours collected between 2000 and 2014. Results: The mean age was 36.6 years. The sex ratio was 1.8. Functional signs were dominated by swelling. Our series included 9 benign and 5 malignant tumours. Histological study showed 5 chondrosarcoma, 4 osteoma, 1 fibrous dysplasia, 1 osteoide osteoma, 1 ossifying fibroma, 1 osteochondroma and 1 histiocytosis. The treatment was surgical in all patients. The recurrence occurred in 7 patients. Conclusion: Due to the rareness and the diversity of facial bone tumours, their diagnosis is often difficult. The diagnostic approach of the pathologist must be based on clinical data to establish diagnostic hypotheses. Objective: To present a case of female patient with a nasal eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis (EAF) and discuss the relationship between this entity and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Method: We prospectively identified one case from our University Hospital. Relevant medical history was reviewed. Histological and IgG4 stain were performed in the tissue. Results: A 37-year old patient attended the otorhinolaryngology clinic because of nasal obstruction and deformity. She referred a history of allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. Physical examination revealed a mass in the nasal septum at the osteocartilaginous union that obstructed and thickened the nasal pyramid. Magnetic resonance showed a round well defined lesion in the nasal cavity measuring 1.6 \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 2.2 cm. The lesion was surgically excised and the tissue was sent to the pathology department. Histologically, the nasal mass tissue demonstrated abundant small vascular channels surrounded by concentric layers of fibrosis with a stroma infiltrated by abundant lymphocytes, eosinophils and plasma cells. IgG4 stain was positive in plasma cells surrounding the fibrotic stroma although the IgG4 to IgG ratio was less than 40 %. Conclusion: EAF is an extremely rare and benign lesion of the upper respiratory tract. Present evidence suggests EAF to be part of the IgG4-RD spectrum. Objective: Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour (pPNET) of head and neck is rare. CD99 positivity is considered sine qua non for diagnosis and other immunohistochemical markers show variable expression. Method: Here, a case of pPNET of parotid gland showing diffuse cyclin-D1 and pancytokeratin positivity is presented. Results: A 19-year-old female referred with swelling on the right side of her face. She did not have a chronic disease history. Physical examination did not reveal any other significant finding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of head and neck showed a well-defined solid mass located in parotis, 32 \u00d7 28 \u00d7 24 mm in size. An incisional biopsy was performed. In microscopic examination, tumour was composed of small roundto-oval cells with scant cytoplasm. Nucleoli were prominent in some cells. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were stained positive for CD99, vimentin, cyclin-D1 and pancytokeratin. A high Ki-67 proliferation index was detected. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as pPNET. Conclusion: To our knowledge, there are less than 10 cases of pPNET of parotid gland reported in the literature. Lymphomas, neuroendocrine tumours, sarcomas and poorly differentiated tumours should be considered in differential diagnosis. Apart from the location, diffuse cyclin-D1 and pancytokeratin positivity was demonstrated in our case. The case is presented to be discussed in these aspects.

Macroscopically, the lesion was 1,4 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0,9 cm and its surface was covered by mocosa. Histopathologically, the tumour was nonencapsulated and had infiltrating borders which were seen as solid nests with mucoid background in some areas. The tumour cells were small to medium size and uniform in shape and were surrounded by hyalinized eosinophilic stroma. Mitotic rate was 1-2/10 HPF and there was no necrosis. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells had positive staining with Vimentin, Pan CK, S-100, EMA, Bcl-2. Ki-67 proliferation indeks was 4-5 %. It was diagnosed as PLGA. Conclusion: PLGA is twice more common in females, with a mean age of presentation at 59 years. Microscopically tumour cells are always regular and lacking in nuclear atypia. Mitotic figures are infrequent, and tumour necrosis is rarely seen. The differential diagnosis of PLGA includes pleomorphic adenoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma and monomorphic adenoma. Objective: Oncocytic cysts are rare benign, slow-growing lesions, lined predominantly by oncocytes, large polygonal cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and an eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. These cysts typically occur in the elderly and their incidence in upper respiratory tract biopsies is between 0.5 and 1 %. Method: In this study, a 64-year-old male was presented. An endoscopic examination revealed well defined two small mass arising from right and left tonus tubarius with covered normallooking mucosa. Results: Lesions were removed totally. After a microscopic examination' oncocytic papillary cysadenoma' was diagnosed. Conclusion: Management of these lesions is conservative and consists of local excision, the endoscopic approach being the treatment of choice. Although oncocytic cysts are benign lesions, follow-up is recommended, as recurrence is possible, especially in the case of patients with multiple involvement, since they may present a tendency to develop new cysts. In this report an unusual nasopharyngeal cystic lesion with multiple involvement occurring in a male patient was presented. Objective: Signaling through the fibroblast growth factor receptor is complex pathway, reflecting the wide range of physiological functions controlled via FGF-FGFR. Amplifications of FGFR1 have been demonstrated in oral squamous cell carcinomas, but its significance still debatable. Thus, we examined FGFR1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Method: Thirty-six OSCC samples were subjected to whole genome analysis through cDNA microarrays and expression profiles were obtained. Expression findings were validated in a different cohort using immunohistochemistry, and FGFR1 protein expression was analyzed according to clinicopathological parameters. Results: Several FGFR1 pathway members were altered according to OSCC T stage, although FGFR1 mRNA expression itself was not. At a protein level, FGFR1 expression was observed in 33 cases (25.8 %), and its expression was related to p53 expression (p = 0.028) and was able to discriminate a worst prognosis in univariate analysis (p = 0.037). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that around 25 % of OSCC express FGFR1 at a protein level, and that FGFR pathway is important in terms of tumour development. Due to the recent targeted therapies based on FGFR1 status, we hope FGFR1 positive patients could be candidates to FGFR-targeted in future. Objective: Connexins have been the targets of numerous studies due to their importance in cellular physiology, as one of the components of GAP junctions. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is one of the most common and most homologous connexin expressed in most epithelial tissues and it is possible that Cx43 play a different role during various stages of carcinogenesis. Thus, we examined Cx43 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.",

Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that around 45 % of OSCC express Cx43, and that the lack of Cx43 expression is related to a higher histological grade, and to a worst disease-specific survival, although further studies could confirm its role as an important marker for OSCC survival. Objective: We present a very rare example of a case of urothelial carcinoma metastasis to the parotid gland. Results: A 54-year-old male, with a history of a nested variant urothelial carcinoma in the bladder, presented with a progressively enlarging parotidal swelling. US showed 4 \u00d7 3.6 \u00d7 2.5 cm hypoechoic mass.

The cells were uniform with oval bland nuclei showing finely granular chromatin. Scant eccentric cytoplasms were seen. Differential diagnosis included salivary gland tumours with basaloid morphology and metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Because no further definite diagnosis could be given, tru-cut biopsy was performed. Biopsy showed a tumoural infiltration with a nested pattern. Cellular morphology was similar to that of FNA. Immunohistochemical positivity for cytokeratin 20, uroplakin and GATA-3 supported a diagnosis of a metastatic urothelial carcinoma.",

Our case is an example of a urothelial carcinoma metastasis to the parotid with welldocumented cytomorphologic and histomorphologic features. Objective: Incidence of thyroid carcinoma has been increasing in the world during the recent 3 decades. We believe that such increase is due to increased detection caused by widespread use of medical imaging, increase in thyroid surgery revealing occult cancer and more deliberate examination of surgical specimen. The aim of the study is the description of the clinical and pathological characteristics of thyroid carcinomas. Method: We report a retrospective study about 210 nodules of the thyroid collected over 3 years (2010) (2011) (2012) , 44 thyroid carcinomas were diagnosed. Results: Thyroid carcinoma represent 21 % of thyroid tumours. The mean age was 48.5 years. The sex ratio was 0.41(13/31). The most common location was the right lobe. The 44 thyroid carcinomas were divided into 41 papillary carcinomas, 1 follicular carcinoma and 2 medullary carcinomas. The stage of these tumours was T1 in 16 cases, T2 in 12 cases, T3 in 6 cases, T4 in 3 cases and 7 cases of micropapillary carcinoma. The survival rate was 100 % at 3 years. Conclusion: This epidemiological study contribute to a better understanding and management of thyroid carcinoma. Further studies are mandatory to determine risk factors and elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms of thyroid carcinoma.",

Method: HSPA2, cox-2 EXPRESSION was immunohistochemistry in samples from 36 LSCC patients. The expression of HSPA2, cox-2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Results: HSPA2, cox-2 were overexpressed in LSCC tissues compared to paired adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.001). Clinicopathological analysis showed that HSPA2, cox-2 expression was significantly correlated with tumour size (P = 0.001), histological differentiation (P = 0.03), and tumour stage (P = 0.0013), lymph node metastases and recurrence, respectively (all, P < 0.04). Conclusion: Our data indicate that HSPA2, cox-2 expression was increased in LSCC, which may be served as a prognostic marker. Objective: Cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is a long established and still valid indicator of adverse prognosis for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, patients in early or even advanced OSCC may not always present clinically nodal disease. Consequently, predictive markers are much needed to guide treatment options, particularly elective neck dissection. This study aimed to find genes associated with metastasis using microarray methodology, in OSCC patients with a well-defined clinical profile. Method: Tumour samples from patients over 40 years of age, smokers and drinkers, with tongue and/or floor of mouth squamous cell carcinoma were stratified in two groups: large, CLNM-negative (T2 or T3N0M0) and small CLNM-positive (T2 or T3N+M0). Cancer cells were laser capture microdissected from fresh tissue. cDNA was microarrayed using a GeneChip\u00ae Human Transcriptome Array and results were validated by qPCR in a larger cohort of patients. Results: After microarray analysis, two overexpressed and three underexpressed genes were selected for validation by qPCR. ANO1 and SHANK2 were validated and showed a significant association with nodal metastasis (p = 0.04 and p = 0.05 respectively). Conclusion: This study identified two genes relevant to nodal metastasis in a group of OSCC patients with controlled clinical features, a finding that may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications for this group of patients. Objective: Podoplanin, a mucin-type transmembrane glycoprotein, is a lymphatic endothelial marker expressed in a variety of cancers. The objective of this study was to investigate podoplanin expression in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of larynx/hypopharynx with adjacent squamous epithelium to assess the association between the podoplanin expression and the clinical-pathological characteristics. Method: 50 primary laryngeal and hypopharyngeal SCCs were included to the study. Immunohistochemical staining for podoplanin expression was quantified by the Intensity Reactivity Score. The association between protein expression and clinicopathological parameters and survival was analyzed. Results: 33 tumours were classified as podoplanin-low (66 %) and the remaining 17 tumours were considered as podoplanin-high (34 %). Thirty-one dysplastic epithelium exhibited podoplanin expression (62 %). There was no statistically significant correlation between podoplanin expression status and the tumour site, differentiation, stage of the disease, distant or regional metastases. Podoplanin expression level correlated significantly with adjacent dysplastic epithelium (p = 0,046) and alcohol usage (p = 0.047). The log rank test did not indicate any influence of podoplanin expression on survival (p = 0.169) or relapse rates (p = 0.841). Although not statistically significant, the majority of the study population were in advanced stage (68 %) and exhibited weak podoplanin expression. Most of the dysplastic epithelium foci were positive for podoplanin.",

Most of the dysplastic epithelium foci were positive for podoplanin. Objective: Tumour budding has been defined as the presence of isolated single tumour cells or small cell clusters in the stroma at the invasive tumour margin. Tumour budding has been suggested to be a prognostic factor in various cancers. In this study, the relationship between tumor budding density and clinicopathological parameters is investigated. Method: Fifty six patients with laryngeal carcinoma, all diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated. Patients were operated by partial or total laryngectomy and neck dissection. Isolated single tumor cells and clusters composed of fewer than five cells were defined as budding foci. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.7 (42-78) years of whom 54 were male and 2 female. The numbers of cases with absent, mild, moderate, and marked scores of budding were 15 (26.8 %), 18 (32.1 %), 11 (19.6. %), and 12 (21.4 %), respectively. Necrosis was present in 12 (21.4 %) and vascular invasion in 35 (62.5 %) cases. Six Objective: To present two cases of Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer of the oral mucosa in association with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Method: The clinical, histomorphological and immunophenotypic features of two recently diagnosed cases of Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer of the oral mucosa in HIV-positive patients were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for CD3, CD20, CD30, CD15, CD68 and Ki-67 was performed. EBER in situ hybridization was used for the detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA within lesional cells. Results: Both cases presented clinically as solitary well circumscribed ulcers which were characterized by dense superficial polymorphous inflammatory infiltrates. The infiltrates comprised cells with a predominant B-cell phenotype which ranged in size from small to intermediate with occasional large immunoblastic forms. Some of the larger B-cells had a Reed-Sternberg-like morphology. The B-cells co-expressed CD20, CD30 and CD15. EBER positivity was detected in most of the B-cells. Co-existent cytomegalovirus infection was coincidentally noted in the second case. Conclusion: Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer represents an unusual form of lymphoproliferative disorder associated with immune suppression and is documented here in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus infection. It should be distinguished from other forms of human immunodeficiency virus-associated oral ulceration due to its indolent nature and excellent prognosis following conservative therapeutic management.",

Objective: To evaluate the coexpression of EGFR and p53 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and to identify possible correlations with histopatologic and TNM staging parameters. Method: Fourty two cases of HNSCC were retrospectively selected. Double immunostain allowed the colocalization of EGFR and p53 on the same specimen. Microscopic evaluation highlighted cases with p53/EGFR co-expression and its possible prognostic value. Results: 48 % of cases showed p53 positivity while EGFR was present in 85.7 % of cases. P53/EGFR co-expression was observed in 45 % of cases. Twenty five cases were laryngeal SCC (44 % of them coexpressing p53/EGFR) and 17 cases were pharyngeal SCC (70.5 % showing co-expression). For laryngeal SCC, a significant correlation was observed between tumor grade (G2), and p53/ EGFR coexpression (p = 0.017). Most T3 and T4 cases showed no p53/EGFR coexpression (p = \u22120.014). All laryngeal SCC coexpressing p53/EGFR had M0 parameter (p = \u22120.05). For pharyngeal SCC, no significant impact of p53/EGFR coexpression on G or TNM parameters had been found. No significant correlation was observed for tumor grade or TNM staging parameters in pharyngeal SCC. Conclusion: P53/EGFR colocalization defines a subclass of laryngeal SCC with less aggressive local invasiveness and low distant metastatic potential.",

            "text": "Method: We present a case of a 16-year-old boy who was admitted in ICU for liver encephalopathy caused by acute hepatitis A. A large ulcerative lesion, covered with thrombus, was observed on his tongue mimicking malignancy, although the possibility of an accidental tongue bite could not be excluded. Results: On biopsy, ulceration of the mucosa, with exudate overlying an inflamed stroma, was shown. The inflammation was mixed with lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, eosinophils and large epitheliod cells, involving the underlying muscle. The epitheliod cells presented with voluminous nucleus and prominent nucleolus. Rare mitoses and occasional atypia were also noted. Findings as such are well consistent with malignancy. On the other hand, TUGSE is a rare entity of the oral cavity that should not be left out of the differential diagnosis. Conclusion: TUGSE is a benign, chronic, self-healing lesion, not requiring surgical excision. Up to date evidence is not supportive that TUGSE may represent a CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder. Objective: Hemangioma is the most common benign tumor of childhood, presenti\u015fng most commonly on cutanous and mucosal surfaces. On the other hand musculoskeletal presentation is extremely rare with the persentage of less than 1 %. Among musculoskeletal forms 15 % are detected in head and neck. Method: Herein we present a intramuscular hemangioma of neck localized in sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) in childhood. Results: A 10-year-old girl revealed to clinic with a mobile, 2 cm mass on medial side of right SCM. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a welldefined mass with slightly increased signal intensity. Surgical resection was performed. Histopathologic examination showed multiple vascular spaces interspersed between the bundles of muscle fiber, confirmed the intramuscular hemangioma. Conclusion: Intramuscular hemangiomas are benign and rare entity of infancy and childhood. A classification of three categories has been proposed according to vessel size: cavernous, capillary and mixed. The most common type is capillary type but our case is mixed type and more rare. The most common muscle involved in head and neck region is masseter muscle, but SCM involvement (as in our case) is really rare. According to localization and histopathologic type our case seems to be extremely rare. Spontaneously regression is generally absent because of this complete surgical resection is needed. Objective: Thyroglossal canal cyst is the most seen progressive abnormality of tyroid gland among congenital canal cyst. Papillary carcinoma is also a tumor mostly seen developing in this area of tyroid tissue on the wall of this cyst wall. Method: In our case, 30 year-old woman having an operation because of a swelling on her neck got diagnosed of tyroid papillary carsinoma in thyroglossal canal cyst.In the total thyroidectomy material of this patient 3 papillary microcarsinoma pieces, 2 classical variants in right lobe sections and 1 follucular variant in left lobe sections, have been observed. Conclusion: It has raised doubts whether it is primary or not as there are concurrently multifocal microcarcinoma in thyroid gland. However, if there is a synchronic papillary carcinoma in TTK and thyroid gland, the multifocal tumor development is also a matter of question. Because of this, as the cyst consistency with cyst epithellium is observed in our case, it is thought that there is a development of multifocal tumor in the cyst and thyroid. Objective: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder which is characterized by multiple cafe'-au-lait spots and neurofibromatosis with some somatic abnormalities. Laryngeal involvement in NF1 is rare and only few pediatric cases have been reported. Herein, we report a plexiform neurofibroma of the larynx in a pediatric case. Method: A 9-year-old-girl was referred to hospital with laryngeal obstructive symptom, dyspnea which was increased during deep inspiration and in a supine position. The patient also fullfilled the criteria for NF1. On physical examination, mass was seen that originated from the vallecula and root of tongue. The mass was pale with smooth contours and covered by normal mucosa. The lesion was removed endoscopically for histopathologic examination. Results: Microscopically, under the intact mucosa, the nodules which consist of uniform, spindle-shaped Schwann cell bundles and a loose stroma were detected. Immunohistochemically, Schwann cells were positive for S-100 protein and the presence of intratumoral axons in neurofibroma was detected by neurofilament positivity. By these findings, histopathological diagnosis was made as plexiform neurofibroma. Conclusion: Plexiform neurofibroma of the larynx in children is rare, however if a patient with a positive NF1 family history presents with dyspnea and laryngeal mass, possibility of neurofibroma should be considered.",

FFOCT images from Head and Neck samples were first compared to the gold standard (HES). An image atlas dedicated to the training of pathologists was built and diagnosis criteria were identified. Then, we performed a morphological correlative study: both healthy and cancerous samples from patients who undergo surgery of oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx were imaged. Images were interpreted in a random way by two pathologists and the FFOCT based diagnostics were compared with HES of the same samples. Results: Here we present preliminary results showing that FFOCT provides a quick assessment of tissue architecture at microscopic level that could guide surgeons for tumor margin delineation during intraoperative procedure. Objective: Osteopontin (OPN) is a glycoprotein involved in progression of many carcinomas, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). It is synthesized by a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal cell types, including macrophages. Recently, a distinct activities of OPN from stromal and parenchymal tumor cells has been proposed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of osteopontin in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from OSCC tissue and to determine its possible prognostic significance. Method: The expression of OPN was immunohistochemicaly analyzed in TAMs from 86 OSCC and compared with clinicopathological variables. The staining intensity was semi-quantitatively assessed as high, moderate and low. Results: Diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for OPN in infiltrating TAMs was classified as high in 21 patients, moderate in 47 patients, and low in 14 patients; OPN+ macrophages were absent in 4 patients. Strong OPN expression in TAMs was associated with low invasive front grade (p < 0.006), low level of inflammatory response (p < 0.018), and a better disease-specific survival (p = 0.009). Expression patterns were not associated with pT stage (p = 0.28), lymph node status (p = 0.21), nor with the WHO clinical stage (p = 0.41). Conclusion: In OSCC macrophage-derived OPN probably has a different function compared with OPN secreted from tumor cells.",

Extra-adrenal paragangliomas are uncommon tumors arising from neuroectodermal-derived paraganglion tissue. The carotid body tumor is the most common of the extra-adrenal paragangliomas but only a few malignant cases have been reported in the literature. Method: We describe a case of malignant paraganglioma of the carotid body, emphasizing the value of immunohistochemical stains for differential diagnosis. Results: A 57 year old woman presented with a left, painless neck mass. The MRI demonstrated a solid, encapsulated lesion on the left carotid bifurcation, which was surgically excised. Macroscopic examination showed a well-defined, red to brown mass measuring 5,4 cm in maximum dimension. On microscopic examination, the tumor was composed of round epithelioid cells arranged in small and large nests around an elaborate vasculature, with involvement of a local lymph node. Focal nuclear pleomorphism and very rare mitotic figures were observed. The tumor cells were positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin, neuron specific enolase, but negative for panCK, TTF1, calcitonin. S-100 stained the sustentacular cells in the tumor. Conclusion: This is a rare case of malignant carotid body tumor with histologically benign aspects and local lymph node metastasis, highlighting the aggressive phenotype. Objective: In an attempt to better understand the tumor microenvironment, the aim of present study was to evaluate the vascular density, extracellular matrix destruction with release of angiogenic factors, and antitumor defense mechanisms in Pleomorphic Adenoma (PA) and Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma (MEC) of salivary glands. Method: Immunohistochemical staining with anti-CD34, anti-mast cells and anti-CD8-T cells was performed on 23 salivary gland neoplasia specimens from PA and 21 specimens from MEC obtained from Araujo Jorge Hospital in Goiania-GO, Brazil. Immunopositivity areas were estimated by image analysis software. Results: Female predominance was observed in both PA (68 %) and MEC (67 %). In PA cases the age ranged from 9 to 64 years, while in MEC cases age ranged from 13 to 75 years. Histologically, out of 21 cases, 6 (28 %) were classified as grade I, 12 (57 %) as grade II and 3 (14 %) as grade III. Immunohistochemical expression of CD34, mast cells and CD8 in MEC were greater than in PA tumours. Conclusion: In malignant neoplasm was observed an enhanced vascular density that could lead to better nutrition and oxygen delivery to tumour, enabling tumoural growth and spread. Additionally, increased vascular bed in malignant neoplasm could allow the arrival of larger amounts of mast cells and CD8 cells.",

Metastasis of an epidermoid carcinoma to Warthin's tumour is extremely rare and the differential diagnosis of malignant transformation is important. We present a case with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) metastatic to the Warthin's tumour of parotid gland in a 71-year-old male patient. Method: Excisional biopsy was performed because of wounds on his head. Left temporal area biopsy was diagnosed as BCC+SCC, right ear and nasal dorsum biopsy were diagnosed as SCC.In terms of investigating metastasis and local spread, the left parotid nodule larger than 1 cm was detected. A fine needle aspiration of parotid lesion was performed and a diagnosis of Warthin tumour was made. The patient underwent superficial parotidectomy as he was not suspected of having SCC in Warthin's tumour preoperatively. Results: Islands of malignant squamous epithelial cells were found to invade the Warthin's stroma (many dilated cysts filled with secretion and lined by double layered cuboidal oxyphilic epithelial cells arranged in a papillary growth pattern, the papillae projecting into cystic spaces). A histological diagnosis of Warthin's tumour with SCC metastasis was made and metastasis was observed in periparotid lymph node. Conclusion: SCC and BCC of cutaneous are very common neoplasms. Locally aggressive behavior is much more common than metastatic spread. The presence of transitional zones right from the benign oncocytic component to the frank malignant epithelium is important to be distinguished from the metastasis of primary carcinoma at another site. Objective: Our aim is to study the clinico-pathological features of two cases of Aspergillus otomycosis. Method: We report the case of a 50 years old man and of a 60 years old woman, complaining of intermittent otalgia lasting for months, despite repeated treatment with local antibiotics and antiseptic irrigation. Otoscopy showed a whitish, cotton wool like growth of the ear, measuring respectively 2 and 3 cm in diameter, associated with Case report: a hyperaemic tympanic membrane. A biopsy was made. Histopathological examination identified straight septate hyphal forms with acute angle branching. Grocott stain was positive. The diagnosis of aspergillus otomycosis was retained, confirmed by mycological examination. Results: The diagnosis of aspergillus otomycosis was retained, confirmed by mycological examination. Conclusion: Otomycosis also known as fungal otitis externa, is rare. Aspergillus, an opportunistic filamentous fungus, can rarely cause otitis externa. Histologic differential diagnosis includes candidiasis and mucormycosis. Antifungal treatment must be prompt and vigorous, to minimize the likelihood of hearing loss and invasive temporal bone infection. Objective: Proliferative verrucous leucoplakia (PVL) is a distinct, particularly aggressive form oforal leucoplakia. Our focus is to discuss morphological features, histogenesis andevolution characteristics of this elusive entity. Method: A 77 year-old man, 50 packages per year, consulted for a lesion of the right lipcommissure. On examination, he had lesions of leukoplakia at the inner surfaces ofthe right and left cheeks, respectively measuring 2.5 and 3 cm. A biopsy on the rightshowed a verrucous carcinoma. A bilateral surgical removal of both labialcommissures was performed. Results: On histology, it is a proliferating tumour in the epidermis having a papillomatousappearance with acanthosis. This proliferation has endophytic and exophyticdevelopment repressing to the depth an inflammatory chorion. This tumour is made oflarge cells, pale, with hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, without cytonuclear atypia. On either side of this lesion, the mucosal lining is slightly papillomatous and hyperkeratotic without disruption or cytonuclear atypia. Conclusion: PVL is a rare form of oral leukoplakia characterized by a significant propensity for processing with a high rate of progression to oral squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous carcinoma and difficulty of an early detection of problems. The most appropriate definition remains a combination of both clinically and histologically. Objective: Fascin-1 is an actin-bundling protein absent in most normal epithelia but expressed in many human carcinomas, where is associated with increased invasive and metastatic potential. Diaphanous-related formin-3 belongs to a family of formin orthologs, whose deficiency promotes motility, invasion and experimental metastasis and significantly correlates with aggressive disease in human tumours. The aim of this study is to assess the expression of Fascin-1 and Diaphanous-related formin-3 in 22 cases of Squamous Cell Carcinomas (SCC) of the oral cavity, in order to identify new biological prognostic markers. Method: Fascin-1 and Diaphanous-related formin-3 expression was assessed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 22 formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded SCC of the oral cavity and in 12 non neoplastic samples from normal mucosa obtained during dental procedures. Results: At IHC, Fascin-1 was highly expressed in SCCs, whereas it was negative in non-neoplastic samples, while Diaphanousrelated formin-3 expression was lower in SCC than in non-neoplastic samples. Objective: Nasal inverted papilloma is a benign epithelial tumour that develops from schneiderian mucosa lining the nasal cavity. It typically corresponds to an endophytic proliferation of transitional cells. Its evolution is marked by the risk of malignant transformation which is possible in 5-15 % of cases into an infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma, or more rarely a transitional cell carcinoma. We report an exceptionnel case of a sarcomatoid carcinoma developed on nasal inverted papilloma. Method: A 57 years old, male, consulting for a chronic unilateral nasal obstruction with epistaxis. Intranasal endoscopy found multiple polypoid lesions that were resected. Frozen section found a benign inverted papilloma. Results: The definitive microscopic examination revealed malignant areas. This areas were composed by large infiltrative sheets of spindle shaped cells with markedly atypical nuclei and numerous mitotic figures. Focally, are seen a squamous differentiation and undifferentiated component. Conclusion: Besides their propensity to be associated with malignancy, inverted papilloma are characterized by their tendency to recur. So the treatment is based on a complete endoscopic resection that can be followed by a raditherapie.",

Method: We report a case of a glottic UPS at a 68-year-old male, who has been smoking for 30 years, and was hospitalized in January 2015 at Emergency County Hospital \"Sf. Apostol Andrei\" Constanta. Results: The tumour was originated in glottic area, upper a right vocal cord, with no paresis. The tumour determined hoarseness for 5 months and dysphonia. Patient underwent surgical excision of the tumour. The immunohistochemical techniques proved positivity for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, CD68, CD34, Ki67, and negative for CD117, NFT, chromogranin, c-erbB2, AE1/AE3, MNF116, desmin, myogenin and p53. Conclusion: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of larynx is a very rare mesenchymal neoplasm. The diagnosis of UPS of larynx was a diagnosis of exclusion and the immunohistochemistry could have been helpful.

Method: We report the case of a TWL of the thyroid in a 61year-old woman presented with a cervical swelling evolving since 3 months without signs of neither compression nor dysthyroidie. Cervical palpation revealed a left isthmo-lobaire firm and mobile nodule measuring 2 cm in diameter. Thyroid ultrasonography showed a multinodular thyroid with a left supracentimetric hypoechoic nodule. Thyroid ponction was normal. Results: The macroscopic exam showed a juxta-isthmic 2,5 cm in diameter nodule. On histology it was constituted essentially by papillary formations inside a cystic cavity mingled to some follicules. The stroma was often constituted of an abundant diffuse lymphoid cloth. Papillas and bladders were papered by oncocytic cells presenting the nuclear features of papillary carcinomas.

Approximately 25 % of MTC is familial, caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. We report 2 cases of MTC with histologic features suggesting hereditary form. Both cases presented in January 2015, so molecular RET-mutation testing results are not available by the date of the present abstract submission. Method: Case 1 refers to a 24-year-old woman with elevated levels of circulating Calcitonin. Histologic examination of the thyroid showed 3 MTCs in both lobes (diameters 1-2 mm) and focal and nodular C-cell hyperplasia with histologic features of Ccell in situ carcinoma. Case 2 refers to a 44-year-old man with elevated levels of circulating Calcitonin. On histologic examination, diffuse C-cell hyperplasia was the main feature of the thyroid. Some nodules with \"neoplastic\" C-Cell hyperplasia features and a MTC of 2 mm were also present. Results: Both cases showed strong Calcitonin and Chromogranin immunohistochemical expression whereas HBME-1 and CK19 were not expressed. To both patients was suggested molecular RET-mutation testing. Conclusion: An early manifestation of all MEN2 syndromes, associated with germline and somatic RET mutations, is C-cell hyperplasia, which eventually progresses to multicentric neoplasia. Advances in genetic screening have enabled early detection of hereditary Objective: To analyze morphometric and ultrastructural changes of pterygoid medial muscle (PTM), under occlusal defects, induced by unilateral left molar extraction, of Wistar rats. Method: Thirty-six male rats: 24 for light microscopy (LM) and 12 for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were divided into three groups (GI-15; GII-30; GIII-60 days), containing 5 animals/3 control each for LM and 3 animals/1 control for TEM. Morphometric studies were made measuring the area of PTM muscle fibers ipsi and contralateral to dental extraction. Qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate ultrastructural findings.",

Both sides were similar when compared with each other, as assessed in the various evolutive periods. Differences were observed in fiber area, especially in first Group and these showed progressive increase, reaching their highest average in GIII. The ultrastructure showed asymmetry and disorganization of Z and I bands in PTM of GII. Conclusion: Unilateral molar extraction can induce ipsi and contralateral morphometric changes of PTM with reduction of the fiber area. However, these fibers seem to adapt to these conditions throughout the experiment. Z and I bands are the most sensitive structures to this dysfunction, however these effects are transitory. Objective: Langerhans cell histiocytosis has been called in several ways in medical history, depending on the anatomical location and also the name of (or) doctors who described this particular form of the disease. It is a neoplastic proliferation of Langerhans cells; the etiology is unknown. It occurs mostly in childhood. The bone is the first site of involvement (solitary eosinophilic granuloma) but many other organs can be involved (skin, lymph node, lung\u2026). The thyroid is rarely affected; there are few cases reported. Method: We report the case of a 26 years old man who undergoes a total thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection for suspicion of a process lymphomatous. Results: Macroscopy: The thyroidectomy has two lobes mesuring respectively 6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 and 5 \u00d7 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cm. When cut, we note the presence of grayish white fleshy in both lobes. Lymph node dissection reported 12 nodes. Histopathology: the thyroid gland and some lymph nodes are involved by nests of medium sized histiocytic cells with well defined cytoplasma, a folded or grooved nuclei that can be lobulated, the chromatin is finely disperssed and the nucleoli are inconspicuous, few mitosis are seen. The histiocytic cells are accompagnied with many eosinophils, small lymphocyts, and some neutrophils. Large focus of necrosis are identifined.The Langerhans cells express CD68, Ps100 and CD1a. Conclusion: Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the thyroid gland are rare neoplasms; there are few cases reported in the literature. The histologic feature is characteristic and permits with the immunohistochimy to achieve a diagnosis even in the cases of unusual presentation. Objective: Histoplasmosis is a disease caused by fungus Histoplasma Capsulatum, which is found in soil or dust contaminated by bats' and birds' excrements. The occurrence is endemic as well as sporadic and humans are infected through the airway. Case Description: Two months after the return from tropical rain forests area in South America, a 24-year-old patient suffered from fever, headaches and haemoptysis for 2 weeks. The CT scan of the upper lobe of left lung showed a solitaire unconfined nodule of 13 mm and larger subhepatal lymphatic node. The patient's Creactive protein was higher. There was a suspicion of atypical pneumonia and the patient started taking antibiotics. Bronchoscopia was negative. Mycoplasmosis and chlamydial infection were excluded. After 6 weeks the CT showed stationar nodule, subfebriles and haemorhagic sputum remained. There were TBC and tumour in the differencial diagnosis. TBC was excluded and the patient was indicated for the surgical revision of nodule. Peroperative biopsy showed a pulmonal process with central caseous necrosis similar to tuberculoma. Special methods detected microorganisms with Histoplasma capsulatum morphology. Conclusion: Pulmonary histoplasmosis with morphology of granulomatous inflammation may occure in immunocompetent individuals as a solitary pulmonary nodule and may mimic the pulmonary cancer in radiologic findings. Objective: Dirofilariasis is an emerging zoonotic infection caused by filarial nematodes transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Human Dirofilariasis is rare and can be classified as pulmonary, subcutaneous, visceral and ophthalmic. We report a case of human Dirofilariasis from Greece with subcutaneous presentation. Method: A 62-year-old male from the city of Patras presented with a palpable painless subcutaneous nodule in the anterior chest wall of 4 months' duration. An excision biopsy was performed.",

Taban Objective: Although tuberculosis can affect any organ, penile tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease. It is occasionally associated with other entities, such as HIV infection, and reflects different modes of transmission. Method: We report a case of an immunocompetent 17 year old male who presented with an ulcerated lesion of the penis. Results: A 17 year old patient was admitted with history of a persistent, painful balanopreputial ulcer for the preceding 6 weeks. Bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged, firm and mobile. The biopsy of the lesion showed evidence of tuberculosis which was confirmed by a positive mantoux test. Gram, Ziehl-Neelsen, Giemsa and Grocott stains all yielded negative results. The HIV test was negative. The findings on a chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Successful treatment was achieved by combined tuberculostatic and surgical approach with circumcision. Conclusion: Diagnosis of penile tuberculosis is often difficult because it can mimic numerous other diseases. This case emphasizes that the possibility of tuberculosis as the cause of a chronic ulcer on the penis should be kept in mind. Objective: Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and remains one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases. We will report a case. Method: A 73 years old female presented to our hospital with abdominal pain and fever. She also had systemic mastocitosis, ulcerative colitis and minor thalassemia. After 16 days of hospitalization she was still unwell. An abdominal angiography was requested to identify a possible source of bleeding. Five days after she was submitted to a laparotomy with the hypothesis of ischemic enteritis. A parcial enterectomy was performed. The patient died the next day. Results: We received a small bowel specimen (23 cm length) perforated and with fibrinopurulent exudate on serosa. Microscopic examination revealed few epithelioid cell granulomas with necrosis. Superficial ulcers were present and also thickening of the wall due to serosal fibrosis. Acid fast bacilli were identified. We also observed involvement of small mesenteric vasculature by inflammation. The diagnosis was intestinal tuberculosis. Peritoneal fluid culture and microbiological testing supported our diagnosis. Conclusion: Intestinal TB represents the sixth most frequent form of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Given that most deaths from TB are preventable, the death toll from the disease is still unacceptably high and efforts to combat it must be accelerated. Objective: Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus. By inhalation and subsequent pulmonary infection, it may disseminate and cause meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Most cases occur in immunosuppressed hosts, including patients with HIV. We will report a case and highlight some clinical-pathologic considerations.

The pathology report only said \"Nodal Cryptococcosis\". The research for Cryptococcus neoformans's antigen in blood was negative. These apparently no concordant results made infectologists carefully consider the introduction of antifungal medicines, that are hepatotoxic, so we asked for two external consultations, both corroborated our diagnosis. Conclusion: Providing descriptions of the fungal elements in the tissue sections with a comment listing possible organisms that can show that morphology should help managing discrepancies between serology results and histopathology. After this case we started to report fungal infections differently. Objective: A study of morphological and immunological features of sex differences in experimentally induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Method: SIRS was induced by intraperitoneal LPS injection of O26:B6 E.coli strain at a dose of 1,5 mg/kg to mature males and females (in proestrus phase) Wistar rats. On the first day after LPS administration alterative changes of the liver, the degree of neutrophil infiltration in alveolar septa, structural changes of the thymus and spleen have been estimated. The levels of endotoxin, corticosterone, as well as AlAT and AsAT activity have been measured in the serum. The levels of IL2, IL4, IL6, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 produced by ConA activated splenic cell have been estimated in cultural fluid by ELISA. Results: As compared with males in females SIRS was characterized by less pronounced inflammatory changes in the liver and the lung, accidental involution of the thymus, decrease of IL6 and rise of TNF\u03b1. In males SIRS was accompanied by increase of endotoxin and IL2 level, decrease of corticosterone, strongly pronounced inflammatory changes in the liver and the lung, accidental involution of the thymus. Conclusion: In the experimentally induced SIRS morphological and immunological manifestations in males Wistar rats were more pronounced in comparison with females. Objective: Schistosomiasis is the second most common parasitic infection in humans. Although Europe is not endemic, considering globalization and some environmental factors, this is not an entity completely apart from the European reality. Method: We searched in our database (SNOMED computer search) schistosomiasis cases between 2000 and 2015. We were able to identify 7. Results: Mean age of diagnosis was 43,14. Sex ratio was 4:3. From the 7 cases: 6 were biopsies and 1 was a surgical specimen. 4 from gastrointestinal tract and 3 from genitourinary tract. Two of these cases had history of co-infection with HIV and 1 case with HBV. One of the cases, a urinary bladder biopsy, from one of the HIV+ patients was also diagnostic for squamous cell carcinoma; soon after the diagnosis the patient died. Histologically it was observed, in some, a granulomatous reaction that surrounded the schistosoma ova (with miracidium) and in others, a more calcified schistosoma ova within a fibrotic stroma. Conclusion: All the reported cases were associated with migration (Portuguese-speaking African countries). In this population HIV and HBV infection is highly prevalent. Concerning HIV, dually infected patients with schistosomiasis and HIV may pose an additional risk of HIV transmition. Concerning HBV, the data is scarce and controversial. Objective: Human parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded DNA virus. During pregnancy, parvovirus B19 infection can be asymptomatic or cause a variety of signs of fetal damage, fetal anemia, nonimmune hydrops fetalis, spontaneous abortion and can result in fetal death. We report of the case of vertical parvovirus B19 infection. Method: The case of intrauterine death at 22 weeks of gestation. B19-virus-specific immunostains (NCL-PARVO, Novocastra) were studied. Results: Birth weight was 630 g. We find hydrops fetalis and congenital lung hypoplasia. Histology the presence of viral myocarditis with lymphocytic invasion and \"lantern cells\". Macroscopic placental examination shows slight and unspecific changes. The placenta's weight was 700 g. Histology may show villitis with lymphocytic invasion and \"lantern cells\". B19-virus-specific immunostains with brain, lung, liver, myocardium, and placenta were studied. Myocardium and placenta were positive. Conclusion: Thus, this case demonstrates intrauterine parvovirus B19 infection with hydrops, myocarditis and specific villitis of placenta. Objective: The development of the neural tube in the complex central nervous system results morphological, cellular and molecular changes, all of which are strictly regulated. Homeobox protein Nkx-2.2 contains a homeobox domain and may be involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system. Neural tube defects (anencephaly, cephalocele, spina bifida) are considered to be the most common and severe ones among congenital malformations. The purpose of the investigation was studying expression of the Nkx-2.2 in human placentas from stillborns with anencephaly.",

Objective: Fraser syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by major features such as cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, malformations of the larynx and genitourinary tract, craniofacial dysmorphism, mental retardation, and musculoskeletal anomalies. Method: An autopsy was performed on a female newborn with multiple congenital malformations to determine the cause of death. Results: Gross examination revelead a severe facial dysmorphism with bilateral cryptophthalmos, low set ears, flat nasal bridge, micrognathia and incomplete ossification of the skull bones. We noticed bilateral complete syndactyly of both hands and feet. Also the newborn had an umbilical hernia, impersorate anus and ambiguous genitalia. Major internal organ anommalies were observed: hypoplastic lungs, bilateral renal agenesia with hypertophic adrenal glands, hypoplasic bladder. We also noticed two small paraovarian nodules which proved to be ectopic adrenal tissue on histopathological examination. Objective: To investigate the mal-rotation of the trabecula septo-marginalis (TSM, Leonardo's cord) within cardiac looping in order to treat during cardiogenesis the ventriculo-arterial malformations. Method: We observed the TSM in the most common cardiac phenotypes of ventriculo-arterial malformations (Tetralogy of Fallot, Double Outlet Ventricles, Transpositions of Great Arteries, Single Outlets) and we reviewed the up to date knowledge on genetic and epigenetic factors involved in cardiac looping. Results: The anatomical observations support the hypothesis that the abnormal ventriculo-arterial connections are successive stages of the same TSM's malrotation process at ventricular level. We identified the counter-clockwise rotation of the outlet septum and the trabecula septomarginalis as anatomical landmarks to describe sequentially all these malformations which account the majority of the most complex congenital heart diseases. Conclusion: The TSM follows the development of the right ventricle. The knowledge of the cardiac embryo-genetic factors determining the mal-rotation of the TSM will allow to interfere on the cardio-genesis modifying the ventricular development and finally reducing the incidence and the severity of the pathological phenotypes. With the recent developments of molecular biology we advocate protocols to investigate the sequential mal-rotation of the TSM in human cardiac tissues. Objective: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) represent the major infectious causes of fetal and neonatal malformations in developed countries, as well as important pathogens that can lead to miscarriage. Method: We report a case of fetal cytomegalic inclusion disease with disseminated Herpes Simplex Virus infection. Results: Ultrasound examination performed routinely during pregnancy indicated the presence of fetal cerebral abnormalities (lissencephaly and ventriculomegaly). The pregnancy was electively terminated at 31st week gestation. The autopsy showed brain with smooth surface appearance without normal convolutions and absence of gyri and sulci in cerebral cortex, dilated lateral ventricles and occipitoparietal encephalomalatia. The histopathological examination of autopsy tissues taken from the brain, lung, kidneys and liver showed numerous enlarged cells containing prominent eosinophilic nuclear inclusions, that are pathognomonic for CMV infection. Multinucleated giant cells associated with HSV infection were found in all mentioned organs. Sections from the placenta showed features of mild chronic villitis and rare CMV inclusion-bearing cytotrophoblast cells. Conclusion: Documentary evidence of histopathological detection of CMV inclusions in multiple organs are very sparse in literature. This case has been reviewed to highlight the causal relationship of viral infections in early pregnancy and abnormalities of the central nervous system. Objective: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are distributed with smooth muscle cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract and responsible for autonomous contractility. Existence of the ICC is still not shown in the choledochal cysts. Herein, we aimed to show whether the ICC are present in human choledochal cysts or not. Method: The specimens consist of 14 common biliary duct from choledochal cysts, 35 gallbladders from cholecystectomies and 10 autopsy specimens for the control group. pCD117/c-kit immunhistochemical antibodies were used in the study. Comparable sections were stained with 1 % toluidin blue to identify from mast cells. Mean numbers of ICC in five randomly selected high-power fields (x40) were compared used Kruskall-Wallis tests. Results: The number of ICC was determined as mean 12.2 \u00b1 4.9 in the gallbladders, 3.4 \u00b1 1.4 in the choledochal cysts and 9.8 \u00b1 2.9 in the control choledochal group. There is no difference between gallbladders and control choledochal groups (p = 0.056). There is significant difference between choledochal cyst and control choledochal groups (p = 0.001).",

The low number of ICC may be responsible for appearance of the choledochal cyst to be based on a contractile impairment. Objective: Blood cysts are exceptionally rare and could be diagnosed in various areas of the heart valves. Usually it is a solitary lesion on mitral valve in childhood. Method: The female neonate, 27 days, 53 cm, 3450 g, was found dead in early morning hours. Previously, baby was healthy, well nourished, non neglected. Up to the day before, when she started to cough, and scheduled for next day regular pediatrician control. After the meal around midnight without problems she fell asleep, alone in the bed. Results: The autopsy was performed with a spectrum of toxicological analyses. At the mitral cusps, on the tricuspidal cusps and on semilunar aortic cusps, on free valvular margin multiple blood cysts were diagnosed. Cysts were oval, up to 1 cm in diameter. The visceral pleural surface was with petechial hemorrhages, and on cut the lung tissue was slightly hyperaemic. Histology was consistent with mild viral pneumonia. Other organs and tests were within normal limits. Conclusion: It is still unclear what the significance of heart blood cysts is, and if they could contribute to this neonatal death. The exact etiology and incidence is not yet estimated.",

Usually, it is located in the head and neck area and exceptionally in the small bowel mesentery. Method: 3.5-year-old boy was admitted to hospital due to acute abdominal pain. The mass was diagnosed as tumour located in the small intestine. The resected part of small intestine 10 cm long with neighboring mesenterial tissue was submitted to Pathology. The termino-terminal anastomosis was performed. There were no complications during or after the surgery. Results: On gross examination, the multiple cystic spaces were noticed on the mesenterial surface close to small bowel. The cysts were with milky white material or with serous yellow fluid, thin walled, smooth surface, from several mm to 3 cm. The small intestine mucosa, submucosa and muscle layers, blood vessels, ganglion cells and nerves were within normal limits. Cysts were covered with flattened endothelium, somewhere with smooth muscle and fibrous tissue in the wall. The diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma was made. Conclusion: Although rare, lymphangioma can occur in the abdomen and can be the cause of acute abdominal pain or even ileus. Objective: Acardiac fetuses are consequences of twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP). Here we present a case of maldeveloped fetus of 40year-old gravida IX who in addition gave birth to a healthy, female child by a cesarean section. Method: Twin placenta within intrauterine mass of maldeveloped fetus was fixed in formalin dissected and sampled for H&E slides. Results: A diamnion monochorion type of twin placenta was recorded with incorrect single umbilical arteries (SUA) both in umbilical cord of newborn and in atrophic second umbilical cord. A 1020 g malformed fetus consisted of rather well formed lower leg with four digital foot and amorphous body mass with omphalocoele and intestinal eventeration. X-ray showed discernible metatarsal and femur bone and undefined small bone cluster in the central part. In the centre of body mass a cavity contained intestines, which demonstrated a multifocal lumen atresia, blind terminal ends, persisting appendix, colon mucosa and scattered in between heterotopic pilosebaceus residues, remnants of adrenal glands, ganglia and neuroepithelium-covered nests. The macroscopic analysis of circulatory system implied that arterial supply of bones comprised anastomosing vascularity type originated from the end of umbilical artery. Conclusion: The reported case was diagnosed as acardius acephalus with a peculiar pattern of organ malformations.",

Mihailova * 5th Multiprofile Hospital, Dept. of Clinical Pathology, Sofia, Bulgaria Objective: Two rare cases of congenital adenomatoid malformation (CAM) and multiple chondromatous hamartoma (MCHH) in the lungs of children are presented. Results: The first case is CAM -hamartomatous lesion in which the main abnormality is an \"adenomatoid\" increase in the terminal respiratory structures (P. S. Hasleton, 1985) . There are three subtypes of the disease, distinguished on the basis of the size of the formed cysts, extend of the lung involved and histologic features (Stocker et al, 1978) . Our case is type III of CAM, which is a solid variant and affects an entire lobe. It is 17 days old girl born from second pregnancy after sectio Caesarea, after being 17 days on assistent ventilation and oxygen therapy, developed bronchopulmonary displasis and died. The postmortem histologic examination of the left lower lobe was consistent with immature canalicular stage lung -CAM type III. The second case is a rare multiple endobronchial CHH in 5 years old girl, born from a first uncomplicated pregnancy. The clinical symptoms started 6 months prior to hospital admission with cough, fever, and clinical and chest X Ray signs of atelectasis of the left lung. After left sided thoracotomy the gross specimen consisted of fully atelectatic dark blue parenchyma, with nodules of 1 to 3 cm in size, contained of islands of hyaline cartilage, glandular elements, smooth muscle fibers and cleft like spaces lined by cuboidal and ciliated epithelium. The preoperative diagnosis of the case presented a difficult problem. Results: The histological examination showed widely spaced intertrabecular areas of the cranial bones, filled with normal appearing bone marrow; congenital bronchiectasias, lung and brain edema and venous congestion of the other internal organs. Conclusion: NTDs still remain life-threatening conditions with high mortality rate in infants. They are one of the most frequent birth defects with complex and not fully understood etiology. Craniolacunia is usually associated with other NTDs. In cases of NTDs, X-ray examination might be useful as a part of the diagnostic algorithm for establishing presence of associated craniolacunia and identification of complicated anomalies.",

We aimed to study the prognostic significance of apoptotic activity in NBs. Method: The study included 35 primary NB cases. The differentiation and MKI of neuroblasts were evaluated in H&E slides. Tumoural apoptotic activity was assessed by both immunohistochemical staining with bcl-2 and TUNEL method. The results were correlated with other prognostic factors and clinical outcome. Results: Twenty-five(71.4 %) NBs were located in the adrenal. Sixteen(45.7 %) cases showed low and 19(%54.3) high MKI. Thirtythree(%94) NBs were immunopositive for bcl-2. The bcl-2 immunostaining scoring was <5% in 2(5.7 %) cases, 5-75 % in 6(17.1 %) and >75 % in 27(77.1 %) .

NB cases located in adrenal showed higher scores of bcl-2 positivity compared to extraadrenal tumours. AI was found to be significantly lower in girls. Statistically significant difference was observed between bcl-2 scoring and tumour localization. Conclusion: Our results showed that apoptotic activity is unlikely to be a prognostic parameter in NB. We conclude that larger series and different methodologies are needed to evaluate the real prognostic value of apoptotic activity in NB.",

The usual site for congenital teratomas is sacrococcygeal region. These tumours are rare in neck region. Improvement in survival rates of these patients raises questions regarding the prognostic significance of immature germ cell elements. We will report a case and highlight some clinical-pathologic considerations. Method: We present the case of a female newborn with 2 days of life, with a large cervical mass. Ultrasonography revealed a well circumscribed tumour, multilocular and with fluid density, suggesting cystic lymphangioma. Surgical specimen was sent for pathologic study. Results: We received a 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm tumour, rubbery and partially cystic. Microscopic examination revealed an immature teratoma that demonstrated several mesodermal elements and immature neural tissue. The tumour was not completely removed. Conclusion: Tumours affecting the fetus and newborn differ from those found in older children and adults, leading to diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Clinical behavior of congenital teratomas is determined predominantly by whether or not the tumour can be completely resected. Histological tumour immaturity does not appear to correlate with malignancy. The long-term outcome with cervical teratoma is still to be elucidated.",

Method: The case concerns a 3-month old male deceased patient, with prior episodes of necrotizing entero-colitis, requiring several subsequent surgical small bowel resections. An autopsy was performed. Results: On autopsy, generalized hypotrophy of skeletal muscles, urogenital and heart anomalies were most prominent. The abdomen was distended, with ascites and a thin wrinkled skin. At the urogenital level, cryptorchidism and bilateral hydroureteronephrosis were noted. Microscopic examination of the kidneys revealed preserved tissue architecture with rare dilated tubules. Heart anomalies were multiple and complex, consisting of a common atrium, a ventricular septal defect, a hypoplastic right ventricle and a hyperplastic left ventricle. Moreover, persistent left superior vena cava and patent ductus arteriosus were present. Other findings included bilateral hydrothorax and pulmonary hemorrhage and condensation. Lung sections revealed signs of diffuse alveolar damage, considered as the cause of death. The diagnosis of Prune belly syndrome associated with complex congenital heart anomalies was also made. Conclusion: Heart anomalies in Prune belly syndrome should be carefully studied since their complexity can affect survival of such patients.

Results: We present a rare case of poorly differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the thymus in a 3-year-old girl. According to the clinical data, there are two tumour formations located in the mediastinum and multiple bilateral lymph node metastases along the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The tumour was diagnosed on an excisional biopsy of a metastatic lymph node. It is composed of nests of malignant epithelial cells, which lack keratin production. The diagnosis is substantiated by an extensive immunohistochemical panel. Conclusion: Thymomas, thymic neuroendocrine epithelial tumours and thymic carcinomas comprise the group of epithelial tumours of the thymus. They are rare and usually seen in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Thymic carcinomas constitute only 4-14 % of thymic epithelial neoplasms. Mediastinal tumours in children are heterogeneous and thymic neoplasms, in particular, are exceptionally rare, observed in only 1,5 %. Thymic carcinomas have aggressive behavior and are often diagnosed at inoperable stages, as in the reported case. Objective: To study maternal floor infarction (MFI) co-occurring with umbilical cord hypercoiling in a macerated fetus. Method: The mother was a 28-year-old woman with initially unremarkable pregnancy. This was her 3rd pregnancy. The previous two pregnancies had been uneventful. During routine antenatal care, fetal ultrasound had shown discrepancy of fetal size and gestational age. At 34 weeks, she delivered a macerated male fetus, weighing 400 g without congenital anomaly. Results: The placenta revealed confluent firm, stiff, convoluted yellowwhite rind-like area on the maternal surface, extending into the placental substance as ramified yellow-white strands, accounting for approximately 40 % of the placental volume. Histology demonstrated eosinophilic fibrinoid material obliterating the intervillous space and separating chorionic villi. The villous capillaries had involuted, with persistence of villous stromal cells and villous outlines. The umbilical cord was hypercoiling, recognized as 0.8 coils/cm (>90 percentile; >0.3 coils/cm). Conclusion: This is the first report of co-occurrence of MFI and umbilical cord hypercoiling. Such changes might cause the hydrostatic pressure gradient imbalance between villous stroma and intervillous space, involving in pathogenesis of MFI. Objective: Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney (ASK) is an extremely rare pediatric tumour which usually presents as a large renal mass with less than 30 cases have been reported so far in the literature. Herein we present a case of this rare entity. Method: A 3-year-old girl, presented with a large abdominal mass. Pelvic and abdominal CT-scan showed 17.3 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 15cm large right renal multi-loculated mass. The cut surface of the nephrectomy specimen showed a multiloculated cystic mass formed of variable-size cysts filled with clear serous fluid with adjacent solid areas showing focal hemorrhage and necrosis. Microscopically, the tumour is composed of pleomorphic mesenchymal spindle cells with marked atypia, associated with chondroid differentiation (benign and malignant) and focal round primitive mesenchymal (blastema-like) cells. Focal myxoid and rhabdoid differentiation is present. Tumour cells are positive for vimentin, CD56, desmin and negative for WT-1, CK AE1/3, CK7 and EMA. Results: Based on the histomorphology, immunohistochemistry, and literature review, the present features were most consistent with the newly described entity Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney (ASK).

In a subset of bone tumours with the same characteristics but lacking the canonical EWSR1-ETS translocation, a new BCOR-CCNB3 gene fusion has recently been identified, suggesting a distinct biological profile. BCOR encodes the BCL6 co-repressor and CCNB3 encodes the testis specific cyclin B3, on the X chromosome. We report two new pediatric cases. Method: Two boys aged of 8 and 9 years respectively presented knee pain with limping and pathological fracture of the femur. Results: Imaging showed osteolytic femoral lesions without soft tissue extension. Histologically, the bone was infiltrated by SBRCT with strong CD99 and CD56 expression, consistent with Ewing sarcoma family of tumours. Transcripts, particularly EWSR1-ETS were negative. Further screening focused on BCOR/CCNB3 gene fusion was positive and tumour cells strongly expressed cyclin B3 and CCNB3 markers. Conclusion: Bone sarcoma with BCOR-CCNB3 gene fusion is a newly described entity that should be taken into account by pediatric pathologists in the evaluation of osseous SBRCT. The potential usefulness of cyclin B3 and CCNB3 as reliable markers is highlighted by immunohistochemical data. Such new knowledge will hopefully improve classification and treatment of these rare sarcomas. Objective: The first cases of Yellow Hyaline Membrane Disease (YHMD) were seen in USA in the beginning of 1965, coinciding with the start of an active intensive care unit for premature infants and the era of prolonged survival of severe cases of respiratory distress syndrome in newborns. We illustrate the clinico-morphological features of YHMD with the last case examined by us in 1998. Method: We present a case of an infant born with body weight 1050 g. Life threatening complications of pregnancy for the mother imposed delivery in the 28th gestational week by Cesarean section. Because of the infant's severe respiratory distress, intermittent positive-pressure ventilation was performed. On the 12th day the child died. Results: The autopsy findings included brain and pulmonary hemorrhages. The histological examination of H&E stained slides revealed presence of bright yellow pigment localized on the luminal side of the eosinophilic hyaline membranes in the lungs and development of broncho-pulmonary dysplasia. Conclusion: The occurrence of YHMD was a result of poor economic conditions at that time and the surfactant shortage in the hospitals. Hopefully, YHMD would remain a condition that is not seen in the practice nowadays and would be discussed only as a phenomenon with historical significance.",

It consists in a complete absence of lung, bronchus and pulmonary vessels of one or both sides and it may present isolated or in association with other anomalies. It has also been described as a feature of Goldenhar syndrome and Mardini-Nyhan association. Its etiology remains unclear, but abnormal development of the aortic arches during embryogenesis is considered a possible cause. Method: We report a case of right lung agenesis encountered at a fetal autopsy at 14 weeks of gestation. Results: First pregnancy of a 29-year-old female without recognizable risk factors for fetal abnormalities or family history of congenital malformations. Prenatal diagnosis included ultrasonography showing fetal hydrops with cystic hygroma. Fetal karyotype obtained by amniocentesis was normal (46, XX). Autopsy confirmed fetal hydrops and right lung agenesis, occipital encephalocele, cleft palate and hemivertebrae were detected. Conclusion: Unilateral lung agenesis was first described by De Pozze in 1673. Although this anomaly is compatible with normal life, it presents varying degrees of severity. Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography is difficult and most cases are identified at autopsy rendering challenging differential diagnosis. Objective: HIV-associated pregnancy is not an uncommon condition in the recent years. Feto-placental sys-tem is highly sensitive to viral injury with HIV-induced vascular and immunologic placental disturb-ances being a most important cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Method: 110 cases of HIV-associated pregnancy (study grope) and 280 cases of uncomplicated pregnancy (control group) were studied. Placental tissue was collected and immunohistochemical study was performed with antibodies to CCR5, BAX, CD34 and Ki67. Immune reaction was measured semiquantitative (by optical density) within the placental capillary endothelial cells, placental stromal cells and syncytiotrophoblast. Results: CCR5 placental stromal cells expression was significantly elevated in the study group in compare to control (p < 0.01). CD34 endothelial expression revealed significantly elevated placental villi vascularity in the HIV-associated pregnancy group with a strong positive correlation between vascularity and the degree of placental insufficiency. BAX placental expression was significantly elevated in the study group (both endothelial and syncytial, p < 0.05) whereas placental cells prolifera-tion index (Ki67 expression) within the study group was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). Objective: Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare malignant soft tissue tumour. Its occurrence in young children involving the sacrococcygeal region is even more rare.

            "text": "Immunohistochemical staining for CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the focus of VUE in the placenta from pregnancy without PE Objective: Liposarcomas represent <3 % of sarcomas under 20 years, the most common being Myxoid Liposarcomas (ML). A specific TLS-CHOP fusion gene resulting from the t(12;16) is present in 95 % of cases. The prognosis is excellent despite a possible progression to round cell liposarcomas with exception for those with a round cell component <5 %, still classified as high grade tumours, independently of age. Method: We report 2 cases in 15 and 16 year-old patients with respectively 12 \u00d7 8 cm and 6.5 \u00d7 4.5 cm right thigh swellings. In patient 1, lymphangioma was suspected because of congenital lymphangiectasy with lower extremity lymphedema. Results: Surgical biopsies both showed characteristic features of low grade MLs with positive TLS-CHOP fusion gene. Karyotype identified a t(12 ;16) (q13 ;p11) in patient 1. Specimen resections showed well circumscribed, partly cystic tumours, with myxoid areas. Histological examination confirmed ML without round cell component and free margins. Patients are closely followed up, disease free at 5 years follow-up. Conclusion: ML may be observed in the pediatric age group. The prognosis is excellent except for tumours with a round cell component < 5 %. RT-PCR for TLS-CHOP fusion gene should systematically be performed to confirm diagnosis and exclude lipoblastoma in the youngest patients. Objective: Isolated omental panniculitis is a rare entity, which presents with the inflammation of the fatty tissue of the omentum. Method: The symptoms may vary from local (e.g. abdominal tenderness or palpable mass) to systemic manifestation including abdominal pain, back pain, fever, weight loss, and bowel disturbances. Results: We presented this case as a first awareness of omental panniculitis in a childhood. Conclusion: It must be kept in mind at the differential diagnosis of ileus. Objective: A case of sirenomelic baby of 18 weeks gestation is reported. In last 4 years this is the 3rd similar diagnosis in a population of 400,000 in our city. Method: The mother has not any relationship with her husband, has not any important disease history, does not drink alcohol, smoke or take drugs and a 24-year-old housewife. Gravida: 3, abortus: 1, ectopic pregnancy: 1. In the18th weeks of pregnancy, because of the emergency, the ultrasound was done and oligohydramnios was seen, then medical evacuation performed and fetal material was examined. Results: Crown-heel length was 16 cm, head circumference was 15 cm, with ambiguous genitalia and bottom of the fetus looked like the mermaid legs due to contiguity, it was 138 g. At radiography, there were 2 femurs and 2 tibias. The extra vertebrae, the median pelvic bone, the posterior tilt of the sacrum, the posterior fused fibula, and the fused feet are well shown. And urothelial and anal orifice could not be determined. Conclusion: There was an artery and a vein in the umbilical cord. Kidneys and lungs were found atrophic in the autopsy. Sirenomelia dipus was diagnosed. Sirenomelia is a rare congenital anomaly with an incidence of one in 60,000 pregnancies. Objective: Recent concept of early-(before 34 weeks) and late-onset (after 34 weeks) preeclampsia (PE) is based on the diverse pathogenic pathways of this entities. Trophoblasic invasion disturbances is the key event in early-onset PE development that mediated by several disregulatad mediators interactions. To study patterns of placental expression of certain mediators in early-and late-onset PE. Method: Early-onset PE group included 15 cases, late-onset -20 cases and control -20 cases. All cases for study group were subdivided into moderate and severe PE subgroups. Immunohistochemical study was performed with KISS-1 and its receptor, GPR54, Notch1, Notch3, VEGF and VEGFR2 antibodies. Endothelial and syncytial expression of mediators was measured. Results: KISS-1 syncytial and endothelial expression was significantly elevated in severe PE cases in compare to control. GPR54 syncytial expression in late-onset PE was significantly lower in compare to other groups. Both Notch1 and Notch3 placental expression was significantly elevat-ed in early-onset PE in compare to control, whereas its elevation in late-onset PE was insignifi-cant. VEGF and VEGFR2 expression was significantly decreased in early-onset PE. Conclusion: The data confirm hypothesis of the role of placental angiogenesis disturbances in early-onset PE development. KISS-1 and GPR54 expression patterns confirm the role of abnormal trophoblastic invasion in early-onset PE.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of neutrophil CD64 in neonatal sepsis in a referral Children's hospital. Method: The study included 68 neonates. 34 neonates with sepsis and 34 neonates for reasons other than sepsis were hospitalized at the hospital, were enrolled. For all infants studied, preliminary tests included CBC, CRP and blood cultures were requested. Simultaneous blood samples to assess neutrophil CD64 was prepared and sent to the laboratory. Results: The mean levels of WBC in patients and control group were 12.49 \u00b1 6.83 and 6.83 \u00b1 3.47, respectively (p = 0.01). The mean levels of Neutrophil in patients and control group were 57 and 48 %, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.04). The mean levels of CRP in patients and control group were 21.47 \u00b1 24.15 and 9.25 \u00b1 21.04, respectively and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.03). The mean levels of Platelet in patients and control group were 245,000 and 299,000, respectively. The mean levels of CD64 in the patient group (74 %) was higher than the control group (61 % Objective: We report a rare case of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. The patient is a 17-years-old girl who had presented in infancy with joint contractures, gingival hypertrophy and cutaneous lesions.Genetic examination confirmed the clinical diagnosis.During the period 2004-2012 the patient underwent excision of multiple papulonodular skin lesions located in head, trunk and extremities. Method: Sections from all surgical specimens were embedded in paraffin and were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Results: Histological examination showed a homogeneous, hyalinized, eosinophilic matrix with cords of fibroblastic cells in the dermis and subcutis. Conclusion: Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder of the connective tissue caused by inactivating mutations in the ANTXR2 gene located on chromosome 4q21. In our case the parents are not consanguinous. The patient has not any visceral manifestations. Objective: Thanatophoric Dysplasia is a form of congenital skeletal dysplasia characterized by short limbs, small thorax, hypoplastic lungs, brain malformation and early neonatal death. The prenatal diagnosis of TD has been well established through sonographic visualization of skeletal malformations. TD is caused by mutations of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 3 gene (FGFR3). Method: Fetal ultrasonography at the 20th week of gestation led to prenatal diagnosis of skeletal malformation and the patient decided a voluntary interruption of the pregnancy. Radiological studies were performed and a tissue specimen was sent for molecular testing before the necropsy. Results: Gross findings are short limbs with curved and short femurs, small thorax with hypoplastic lungs, and enlargement of temporal lobe of the brain without a cloverleaf skull morphology. The brain, body and lung weight ratios confirm macrocephaly and lung hypoplasia. Histopathologically, the longitudinal skeletal sections (femurs) show a disorderly and disturbed endochondral ossification. The epiphyseal growth plate is also severely disorganized. Temporal dysplasia is no clearly recognized. The radiological studies demonstrated the gross findings and support the diagnosis of DT type 1. The molecular test for mutation on FGFR3 is positive (p.Term807Trp). Conclusion: We report a male case of Thanatophoric Dysplasia type 1 with the morphological findings and FGFR3 mutation. In most cases TD is a sporadic mutation. The FGFR3 mutation has been suggested in relationship with the abnormal brain development and the severely disturbed ossification. Most fetuses with TD are diagnosed correctly by ultrasonographic examination and the post-mortem studies confirm the morphological characteristics of TD.",

Method: We performed a muscle biopsy in a 10 months old hypotonic boy, who had delayed motor milestones, was unable to sit, rise from supine, roll over or fully control his head, had achilean contractures, diminished active movements and creatine kinase level of 2700 U/l. The muscle cryosections served for histological, histochemical and histoenzimological stains. Immunohistochemical tests used antibodies against the three domains of dystrophin, alpha, beta and gamma sarcoglycans, dysferlin, utrophin, beta dystroglycan and merosin. Western blotting (WB) technique was used for calpain 3 and merosin. Results: Muscle biopsy revealed a marked variability in fiber size, increased endomysial/ perimysial fibrosis, mononuclear endomysial inflammatory infiltrates, necrotic fibers, highly suggestive for a dystrophy. Absence of merosin immunostaining, confirmed by WB, and normal expression of all the other proteins diagnosed our little patient with MDC1A. Conclusion: The pathological diagnosis, confirmed by the detection of a nonsense homozygous mutation in the LAMA2 gene: c.5221C>T, p.Arg1706*, is essential for clinical surveillance and genetic counseling as the boy's mother, pregnant again, can be properly monitored. Objective: Duplications of alimentary tract (DAT) are uncommon congenital lesions. Our study will analyze this entity anatomical and histopathological characteristic. Method: Fifteen-year documentation and paraffin embedded samples retrospective analysis at Pathology Department, Mother and Child Health Care Institute of Serbia. Results: In the period from February 2000 to January 2015, 23 patients with 24 DAT were treated at Institute. Ages ranged from 3 days to 15 years (median 13 month) and 54.16 % were younger than 1 year. A size varies from 2 to 18 cm. The most frequent site involved in 29.17 % was ileum, than come jejunum and colon (16.66 %), esophagus (12.5 %), thorax (8.33 %), mouth, stomach, duodenum and rectum (4.17 % each). Predominantly males were affected (70. 83 %) . Most of the duplications were spherical in shape (70. 83 %) . Common muscular wall between normal and duplicated segment was found in 7 (29.17 %). The luminal communication had 4 (16.67 %) duplications. One patient had two synchronous duplications of esophagus and jejunum. Presence of ectopic gastric mucosa was found in 29.17 % of duplications. Statistically significant association was found between gender and shape (p = 0.04). Conclusion: DAT are rare condition that may occur anywhere from the mouth to the anus, diagnosis relies on histology and only treatment is surgery.",

Galectin-3, which can regulate immune responses upon infection and inflammation, was not studied so far in intrauterine infection leading to pre-term pre-labor rupture of the membranes (PPROM), though galectin-1 was recently reported to be implicated in the process. We determined galectin-3 protein expression in the chorioamniotic membranes and its changes during histological chorioamnionitis. Method: Fetal membranes were obtained from women with PPROM with (n = 15) and without chorioamnionitis (n = 15) during second and third trimester. Tissue sections were immunostained using anti-galectin-3 antibody, avidin-biotin system, and DAB as chromogen. Immunoreactivity was evaluated semiquantitatively and statistically analyzed using ANOVA test. Results: Galectin-3 protein was detected in the amnion epithelium, chorionic trophoblasts, mesenchymal cells, and decidual cells. Galectin-3 expression is increased in fetal membranes and in the amniotic epithelium (p < 0.001) in patients with chorionamnionitis. Conclusion: Chorioamnionitis is associated with increased galectin-3 expression and strong immunoreactivity of the fetal membranes. Galectin-3 may participate in the regulation of the inflammatory responses to chorioamniotic infection.",

Placental examination confirm clinical findings. Objective: The definition of myocarditis in post mortem tissue sampling is unclear and there is great variability in reported incidence. Histological diagnosis can be difficult when inflammatory cell infiltrates are focal and not diffuse with little myocyte damage. We review cases of sudden death attributed to myocarditis in a large UK based series. Method: Our national SCD database contains information on 3,731 cases. Results: Ninety-four cases (2.5 %) had myocarditis and 25 cases (0.7 %) had cardiac sarcoidosis making total 3.2 % of all SCD. In myocarditis cases, 55 % were male and 45 % were female. In cardiac sarcoidosis 72 % were male and 28 % female. The age distribution showed a younger mortality in myocarditis (30-49 years of age) compared to an older population with cardiac sarcoidosis (40-59 years of age). Most had no previous history of sarcoid. The most common cell type was lymphocytic (48 %), mixed cell type (19 %), neutrophil (14 %) , eosinophilic (13 %), histiocytic (4 %) and giant cell (2 %). Conclusion: Myocarditis causing SCD is low in this general population. Lymphocytic inflammation still predominates. Cardiac sarcoid can cause SCD in the absence of previous clinical diagnosis. We recommend a multidisciplinary approach with extensive sampling and the use of ancillary tests (viral polymerase chain reaction, genetic testing). Objective: New International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria for reporting pathologic antibody mediated rejection (pAMR) were recently proposed (2013).The aim of this study, was to assess the significance of histopathological changes in diagnosis and monitoring of AMR in Polish one center EMBs material. Method: 1350 EMBs from 212 patients who underwent heart transplantation in years 2001 -2013, were initially diagnosed as AMR1and AMR0, according to ISHLT 2004 criteria (based on C4d positivity). In all EMBs histopathological features suggestive of AMR such as interstitial edema, endothelial swelling and intracapillary activated mononuclears, were specified. The frequency of each individual change was compared between groups. Results: 121 EMBs from 16 patients with AMR1 (group 1), and 1229 EMBs from 196 patients with AMR0 (group 2), were analised. Endothelial swelling was observed in 47 (38, (6,75 %) EMBs from group 2, p < 0.001. There was no significant difference in frequency of histopathological features when EMBs were analised according to time course after transplantation. Conclusion: Intracapillary activated mononuclears and endothelial swelling are statistically more often found in EMBs of patients with C4d positive EMBs, therefore, presence of these two changes may be suggestive of AMR in patients with C4d negative stain. In our study, time after transplantation has no impact on presence of individual histopathological changes.",

The main pathology was DCM (n = 10). Two patients served as controls (n = 1 ischemic cardiomyopathy, n = 1 sarcoidosis). Using a stereological cut point method, number, cut points and points of selected subcellular structures were counted as required. Secondary parameters were calculated. F-test and Student's t-test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.01) were found between the two groups concerning the volume density of the mitochondria, with lower levels in the control group (0.023 vs 0.026). The opposite was true for relation of surface to volume density (mean values 10.24 vs 9.24 in DCM), indicative of a higher number of smaller mitochondria in DCM patients. The numerical density was also higher in DCM patients (0,90 controls vs.1,06). Conclusion: The higher numerical density values in DCM patients and the above results are indicative of a higher capacity of oxydative phosphorylation along the christae and an elevated need for energy in DCM compared to other diseases.",

Sparse data exist on lymphatic vessels presence in endocarditis. Method: Total of 52 patients with surgically resected valves was included. Endocarditis was present in 18 aortic valves and 10 mitral valves. Control group consisted of 15 degenerative aortic valves and 9 degenerative mitral valves. There were 22 males in endocarditis group and 17 males in control group, respectively. Podoplanin antibody immunohistochemistry and morphometrical analysis was performed. Results: The lymphatic density in endocarditis was 885,47 \u00b1 648,71 vessels/mm2 in comparison to 51,73 \u00b1 83,57 vessels/mm2 in degenerative valves. Lymphatic vessels mean size was 93,2 \u00b1 249,2 \u03bcm2 and 60,6 \u00b1 87,9 \u03bcm2 in endocarditis and degenerative valves, respectively. Conclusion: Lymphangiogenesis is markedly more frequent during endocarditis as compared with valve degeneration. Aiming towards lymphangiogenesis may add to the future treatment of endocarditis. Objective: The frequency of isolated cardiac sarcoidosis diagnosed on the results of EMB biopsy is 0,2 %. We report two cases, which is 0,3 % of our EMB material for 15 years. Method: A man of 47 years old and a woman of 50 years old presented with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography/computed tomography of heart detected active myocarditis. EMB was taken after radiofrequency ablation. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, CD3, CD8, CD68, HLA-DR. Results: The diagnosis was confirmed by histologic study of EMB which showed granulomas similar in size and morphology consisted of multinucleated giant cells with vacuoles and asteroid bodies, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes and a peripheral rim of fibrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed rimmed granulomas, detected the central distribution of CD68+ cells and the peripheral distribution of CD3+ and CD8+-ones. Chest computed tomography scan revealed no evidence of thoracic pathology. Conclusion: In both cases the isolated cardiac sarcoidosis was diagnosed retrospectively after the results of EMB. The treatment with prednisolone at the initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day was prescribed in both cases. Reduction in prednisolone dosage resulted in rebound VA even 2 years after the disease onset. Objective: The cell signaling related to PI3K play a role in the pathogenesis of diseases with inflammatory component as sepsis. This pathway has also been reported as a regulator of cardiomyocyte contractility, which could be related to expression of the structural glycoproteins, mainly dystrophin, which confers stability to the myofiber and transmits force between sarcomeres and cell membrane to the extracellular matrix.",

Histopathologycal analysis showed foci of disorganized miofibrils and increased membrane permeability, more evident in CLP plus LY294002 as compared to CLP and controls. We observed decreased myocardial dystrophin expression in septic mice, but this dysthophin loss was more pronounced in myocardium from septic mice plus LY294002.

This study described a critical comparison of a short and long-term DOX infusion protocols to induce HF in rats. Method: Wistar rats were allocated in ST group (short-term), treated with cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg of DOX during 2 weeks and LT group (long-term) received cumulative dose of 18 mg/Kg of DOX during 9 weeks. Control groups received saline. Histopathological and echocardiography analysis at basal condition and 2 weeks after the end of the treatment was performed. Results: Loss of myofibrils and vacuolar degeneration of cardiomyocytes in all DOX-treated hearts were observed. Interstitial collagen volume fraction was more significant in ST and LT group as compared to controls. No differences between ST and LT were observed. Echocardiographic study showed augmentation of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dimensions and reduction of ejection fraction in LT as compared to ST and controls. Conclusion: Results indicated that LT infusion is more effective in inducing HF and cardiac changes when compared to ST-infusion. The unconformity between functional and structural changes could reflect a retard between the onset of myocardial changes and cardiac dysfunction. Objective: Congenital anomalies of the aortic arch, representing a wide range of relatively less known and rarely clinically diagnosed congenital heart diseases (CHD). Method: Retrospective analysis of autopsy protocols during 52-year period from Archive for congenital heart disease Institute of Pathology, University of Belgrade; Mother and Child Health Institute, and Clinic for the gynecology and obstetric, Clinical Center of Serbia, from 2000 to 2011. A total of 1.460 cases of CHD were reviewed, and only in 245/1460 cases, the anomaly of the aortic arch was found (16.8 %). Results: Survival over 1 year of age was 18.8 %, and under 1 year was 81.2 % of the cases. This showed statistically significant difference (p < 0.01). Right aortic arch was found in 26.9 % of cases. Vascular ring was observed in 3.7 % of cases. Tubular hypoplasia was observed in 20.4 % of cases. Coarctation of aorta occurred in 21.6 % of cases. Interruption of the aortic arch was found in 12.6 % of cases, and aortic arch atresia occurred in 6.9 % of cases. Left aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery was found in remaining 7.7 % of cases. Conclusion: Recognition of these anomalies are essential for a possible a surgical correction, which often allows complete recovery of patients. Objective: Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (C-TGA) is characterized by normal veno-atrial connections, but with discordant atrio-ventricular and ventriculo-arterial connections, allowing hemodynamic correction. Method: We analyzed autopsy records of cases with congenital heart diseases (CHD) during 40 years period. C-TGA was found in 33 out of 2.593 autopsy cases (1.3 %). The sex incidence showed a slight male predominance (male 54.5 % ; females 45.5 %). Modified Rokitansky technique was used for all cases with CHD. Results: Associated cardiac anomalies were present in all cases of C-TGA. The most commonly associated anomalies were: ventricular septal defect (48.5 %), atrial septal defect (45.5 %), valvular or subvalvular pulmonary stenosis (33.3 %). Other associated cardiac leasions were malformations of aortic arch (15.2 %), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (15.2 %), patent ductus arteriosus (15 %). The major cause of death was bronchopneumonia (45.5 %), and the most frequent extra-cardiac additional congenital defect was asplenia. Conclusion: The existence of the C-TGA do not change the quality of life of these patients, because it does not disturb the normal hemodynamics of the heart. The problem may arise when it appears with a number of other cardiac anomalies, so they determine and influence the lives of these patients. Intra-cardiac shunts are the most common form of associated cardiac anomalies. Objective: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is characterized by several cardiac abnormalities. Anomalies that are included in this syndrome are hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the left ventricle, atresia or hypoplasia of the mitral valve, and aortic atresia or hypoplasia. Method: The data were obtained by retrospective analysis of 2.593 autopsy protocols from the Archive of congenital heart deseases, Institute of Pathology, School of Medicine, Belgrade, and the autopsy protocol from the Institute for Health Protection of Mother and Child, from 1990 to 2014. The analysis used descriptive and analytical methods statistically. Results: From a total of 2.593 autopsied cases, HLHS was found in 59 cases, or 2.3 % of the total number of autopsies in the period from 1990 to 2014 year. HLHS is more common in males (p < 0.01). High statistical incidence was found in hypoplasia of the aorta, and the right aortic arch (p < 0.01). Heart failure was the most common immediate cause of death, demonstrated by highly significant difference (p < 0.01). Endocardial fibroelastosis was also more often present in children with HLHS (p < 0.01). Conclusion: In our study was observed increased occurrence of malformations in male patients, the longer survival in female patients, and the most common immediate cause of death was a heart failure. Objective: Myocarditis (MC) is an inflammatory disease of the cardiac muscle without any association with ischemic heart disease, or other entities. Method: We analyzed 30 autopsied cases with MC. For the pathohistological (PH) diagnosis of MC we used a modification of Dallas's criteria. We investigated the correlation between the clinical data obtained from the request for clinical autopsy, and PH findings in the myocardium. Results: From 30 investigated cases with PH diagnosis, the clinically suspected diagnosis of MC was made only in 1 case (3.3 %), which showed high statistical significance (p < 0.001). From all the morphological forms of MC, the most common findings were acute MC (76.7 %). MC as the cause of death was found in only 8 /30 (26. 6 %) cases, what showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.016). Rhythm disorders were observed in only 5/30 (16. 6 %) patients, what showed also a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001). Conclusion: In this study we confirmed that only in one case the clinical diagnosis of MC was suspected. This indicates that the clinical diagnose of MC is still very difficult, and that the number of diagnosed cases is far from real. Autopsies are the rule.",

Here, the question has been posed: can an imbalance of tetraspanins result in intratumoral thrombosis, necrosis, calcification and finally fragmentation of cardiac myxomas? Method: The study included 14 cases of cardiac myxomas with advanced degenerative changes. Resected tumours were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and were then processed with routine histopathological procedures. An immunohistochemical analysis using mouse monoclonal CD9 (EPR2949) and CD63 (ready for use; NKI/C3, Cell Marque) antibodies was performed. Results: 7 tumours were right-sided atrial myxomas and 7 of them were left-sided measuring from 1.2 to 4.1 cm with medium size of 2.82 cm. The clinically higher suspicion of endocardial thrombosis was associated with sessile compared to polypoid myxomas, left sided tumours compared to right-sided ones. CD9 overexpression was recorded in every case with granular cytoplasmic pattern of staining. Weak granular cytoplasmic reactions were observed in case of CD63. Conclusion: Observed here CD9 overexpression explains and confirms CD9 contribution in neovascularization and extracellular matrix modeling but the meaning of a weak expression of CD63 remains still unclear and needs further studies.",

The present study investigated the role of DNA reparation enzyme-poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) in the pathogenesis of diabetic changes in the heart and nerve tissue. Method: Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced in rats by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 50 mg/kg. The PARP expression was studied by immunohistochemistry. The study was approved by a local ethical committee. Results: Obtained results showed that induction of DM induced major histopathological changes in myocardial and nerve tissue, like the pericellular and perivascular oedema, focal necrosis and inflammatory changes. In addition, in diabetic animals number of PARP positive cardiomyocytes in myocardial tissue increased (32 \u00b1 17 vs. 10 \u00b1 3 cells/mm2 ; p = 0.001. Furthermore, in DM increased the numbers of PARP positive Schwann cells in nerve tissue compared to control group (23 \u00b1 9 vs. 12 \u00b1 4 cells/mm2; p = 0.02. Conclusion: The present study suggests that increased PARP expression plays a pivotal role in the heart and nerve tissue damage in diabetes mellitus. Novel pharmacological strategies influencing on PARP expression could be beneficial in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Objective: Discussion of a case of aortic root dissection after aortic valve replacement (AVR) with reposition of right coronary artery (RCA). Method: We present a case of an 88-years old deceased male who died in the outpatient settings and forensic autopsy was instituted. No past medical records were available. Results: Gross internal examination revealed that the aortic valve had been replaced with a biological valve. The RCA was found to have been moved surgically 1.5 cm up in the aortic wall. There was dissection of the aortic root, forming a cavity adjacent to the aortic valve, in the area of native anatomical position of the RCA, underlying the stitches. The cavity was found filled with foul-smelling pulp-like whitish material with visible thick reddish-brown formation. Complicated atherosclerotic changes were seen away from the dissection, in the area of aortic arch. The histology from the wall defect showed cellular debris accompanied by mild lymphocytic infiltrates, compatible with atheromatous collection and passed thrombosis. Myocardial tissue exhibited chronic ischemic damage with disseminated foci of myocytolysis that were accredited cause of death. Conclusion: The authors discuss the possibility of aortic dissection to be a postoperative complication, provoked by surgically compromised integrity of the aortic wall at the background of atherosclerosis. Objective: Pointing out the need of combining morphology, immunohistochemistry and molecular studies for exact categorization of cardiac sarcomas due to their low frequency and heterogeneity. Method: A 4.5 cm cardiac tumour was studied after surgical resection. The patient was a 41-year-old male with right auricular lesion, transmural affectation and intracavitary growth. Conventional histological sections were obtained and immunohistochemical stains. Molecular studies performed included FISH for EWS gene break-apart, RT-PCR for SYT/SSX fusion transcript, and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis.",

Dot-like desmin expression with enolase and keratin described in desmoplastic small round cell tumour wasn't confirmed after negativity for EWS gene rearrangement. However SYT/SSX1 gene transcript characteristic of synovial sarcoma was demonstrated with RT-PCR. Structural abnormalities of chromosome 3 and 12 were found. Conclusion: Cardiac sarcomas are uncommon tumours. Synovial sarcomas are described around 1 % of them. Accurate diagnosis can be difficult without help of auxiliary techniques, but it's important to achieve the most effective treatment for patients. Objective: The systemic amyloidoses is a heterogeneous group of disease characterized by extracellular deposits of misfolded fibrillar proteinamyloid, causing multiple organ dysfunction. In amyloidosis, the greatest risk of death occurs in patients with cardiac involvement, who typically develop diastolic dysfunction and systolic heart failure then, with predisposition to arrhythmias and sudden death. Method: We report a case of a woman (70 years) who died due to anteroseptal myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiogenic shock. Posmortal examination of a number of organs (heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, etc.) has discovered a senile systemic amyloidosis with deposition of transthyretin. Widespread amyloid deposits were found in extracellular spaces and in the wall of medium-sized and small blood vessels. The most pronounced changes were in the heart. Results: Amyloid deposits in the epicardial and intramural blood vessels have significantly narrowed lumen and lead to myocardial infarction. Focal nodular deposits were found in the myocardioum. Atherosclerosis of the coronary artery was not significant. Conclusion: Although the typical presentation of cardiac amyloidosis is an infiltrating restrictive cardiomyopathy, this case report illustrates that ischemic small vessel coronary disease caused by deposits of amyloid which can lead to fatal complications such as myocardial infarction.",

R\u00f6cken Objective: To investigate amyloid sites and types in endomyocardial biopsies from patients with diagnosed amyloidosis. Method: Diagnostic immunohistochemistry of amyloid was performed using a panel of peptide antibodies against different types of amyloidosis. To detect AL\u03ba amyloidosis an expanded kit of antibodies was used for the first time: commercially available antibody against AL\u03ba amyloidosis and four new commercially unavailable antibodies directed against \u03ba-light chain variable and constant regions. Results: 49 biopsy samples from 49 patients (average age 70 years) -30 males, 17 females and 2 of unknown gender were examined. The most common diagnosis was transthyretin amyloidosis (24 patients); AL\u03ba amyloidosis was found in 13 patients and AL\u03bb amyloidosis -in 11. Only one of 49 patients had AA-amyloidosis. Conclusion: Transthyretin amyloidosis was the most common finding in endomyocardial biopsies mainly from male patients. Antibodies generated in our study against \u03ba-amyloidosis were characterized by high specificity for detecting AL-\u03ba-amyloidosis and had no specificity for other amyloidosis types. Method: Endomyocardial biopsy sample, taken from a man 26 years old with unspecified myopericarditis. At the age of 16 EchoCG showed symmetrical hypertrophy of left ventricular myocardium. Cardiac conduction disease, progressive diastolic dysfunction, hydropericardium, and increase in creatine phosphokinase and troponin levels appeared sequentially in the order listed.

The Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD) is the most frequent location of the dissection. Method: We report the case of a 36 year old woman who suddenly collapsed 10 days following the uneventful delivery of her second child by cesarean section. She had complained of chest tightness and ear pain in the days prior to her collapse. She had no medical history and was not on any medication. At autopsy coronary artery dissection was found starting~1 cm from the ostia of the LAD and extending at least 3 cm distally down both the LAD and left obtuse marginal branch. An extensive area of acute infarction was discovered, involving the lateral left ventricle wall extending towards the anterior and posterior surfaces. Histological findings confirmed acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery dissection, with no evidence of atherosclerosis. Conclusion: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection should be suspected in those presenting with chest tightness in the peripartum period even in the absence of risk factors. It should be noted that ear pain can be a manifestation of cardiac pain. Objective: Bronchogenic cyst is a congenital anomaly, appearing mainly in the cervical and retroperitoneal soft tissue, and occasionally with intradiaphragmatic, intrapericardial, intraspinal localisation. The intracardiac presentation is very rare, diagnosed usually between the 2nd and 4th decade. Method: A 10-year-old girl with common atrioventricular canal, mitral valve cleft and interatrial septal defect during a routine clinical control was diagnosed with a giant interatrial aneurysm protruding into the left atrium. Surgical resection of the aneurysm was performed in parallel to the basic defect correction. Results: Intraoperative aspect of the interatrial lesion was a multilocular cyst with fluid collection, covered by a translucid membrane, mimicking a hydatid cyst. Microscopy revealed multiple cystic cavities, lined by PanCK and CK7 positive, but Inhibin, Calretinin, TTF1, WT1 and CD34-negative pseudostratified ciliated epithelium, disposed in a smooth muscle and fibrous conjunctive stroma, with focal calcifications, giant cell reaction and rich mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate with tendency to form lymphoid aggregates.

Objective: The effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition on reversing/ attenuating endothelial dysfunction was evaluated in an animal model of type 1 Diabetes Mellitus induced by streptozotocin. Method: The animals were divided into four groups: controls, diabetics and controls and diabetics treated with sitagliptin 5 mg/kg/day during 2 weeks. Isolated aortic rings were used for functional studies and western blot analysis and histological sections were used for oxidative stress analysis and histochemical studies. Results: Vasorrelaxation responses to acetylcholine were more potent in control rats treated with sitagliptin. Unexpectedly, in diabetic treated rats, sitagliptin seemed to compromise the acetylcholine maximum response. There were no statistically significant changes in the expression of active eNOS and active Akt in all groups, although a significant increase in the expression of GLP-1R in diabetic rats was observed compared to control animals, which tended to decrease with sitagliptin. A significant increase in DHE fluorescence intensity on diabetic rats aorta rings, compared to control animals, was significantly reduced after sitagliptin treatment. Finally, instead of a disruption of the aortic tissue, an increase in matrix density was observed on diabetic rats' aortas after sitagliptin. Conclusion: In sum, the sitagliptin vascular beneficial effects, were compromised in the presence of T1DM, and were partially reversed by the drug in the 2 weeks treatment period.",

However, intravascular bone formation is exceptionally rare. We present a rare case of ossification of renal artery's wall in a patient with urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis. Method: A 78 year-old man was referred to our hospital because of an infiltrating urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis in an ectopic kidney and underwent a total nephrectomy. Results: Histological analysis demonstrated atherosclerotic plaques in the medial layer of the renal artery including a focus of bone formation with bone marrow presence. Conclusion: In the vast majority of human atheroscerotic plaques calcium deposits are observed however osseous and bone marrow formation is exceptional. Evidence indicates that vascular ossification is a regulated process that resembles embryonic endochondral osteogenesis involving osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells. However others investigators suggest that artery calcification is a non-endochondral ossification process, mainly observed in patients with diabetes as well as with endstage renal disease. In these cases, mineralization resembles intramembranous calvarial bone formation, in which no cartilaginous precursor is formed.",

Method: 12 samples of distal anastomosis of the femoropopliteal prosthesis was studied 2 years after reconstructive surgery. Material for the study received after amputation about irreversible ischemia and studied using light microscopy. Results: 24 months after the operation in the anastomotic adventitia we observed focal and diffuse infiltration with polymorphocellular exudate, containing mainly lymphocytes, macrophages and single histiocytes. Hyperplastic neointima unevenly thickened, partially without epithelium, with portions of thrombotic masses. The boundary between intima and middle membrane is clear, with moderate diffuse focal of lymphohistiocytic infiltration. Twenty-four months after the operation inflammatory changes in the contact of prosthesis and artery remain, chronicity and resorption of prosthesis tissue take place. Resorption cells and macrophages surround the prosthesis, without penetrating its substance. Tunica media reactively modified by cells, producing cytokines and inflammatory mediators, contains foci of angiogenesis and destruction, internal elastic membrane is flattened or missing. Hyperplastic intima is dense, sometimes there are areas of destruction and expansion of both the neointima and endothelium covering it, which leads to thrombosis. Conclusion: Despite the later stages, there is chronicity of the inflammatory process, which leads to intimal hyperplasia, destructive changes of the internal elastic membrane and the development of restenosis of the reconstructed area and thrombosis of prosthesis. Objective: Intimal sarcoma is a strange and mesenquimal tumour that seats in large blood vessels, (mainly aortic and pulmonary arteries). It has a discussed miofibroblastic origin. It is a poorly differenciated tumour with atypia and a variable mitotic index. It is sometimes associated to MDM2, CDK4 and EGFR1 mutation. The MDM2 mutation is related to TP53 restriction, what can supose a terapeutic strategy. EGFR1is related to less differenciated tumours, less supervivence and quimioresistance and CDK4 delection has been demostrated in almost there sarcomas. Method: We present two patients who were diagnosed by intimal sarcoma of pulmonary artery whose MDM2, CDK4 and EGFR1 were evaluated. Results: In our patients, CDK4 was positive in both cases, however MDM2 was only positive in one of them. EGFR1 was negative in the two.Both cases were diagnosed after surgery and today they cotinue alive, after 27 months the first one and 5 months the second one. The first one has suffered from metastases that were resected and they two have no syntoms in this moment. Conclusion: Currently, there is not a clear treatment strategy in chemotherapy. Overall immunohistochemical detection of overexpression of MDM2, EGFR1 or CDK4 means a molecular aberration that can benefit from targeted therapies. Objective: Evidences from our laboratory demonstrated that cytosolic calcium overload caused increase activation of intracellular calciumdependent proteases, such as calpain-1 resulting in dystrophin loss/disruption, which could be implicated in the genesis of myocardial depression. This study tested the hypothesis that increased amounts of calpain-1 and ubiquitin in experimental sepsis induced by CLP could be associated with dystrophin loss/disruption through the inhibition of cardiac mTOR expression. Method: Male C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to sham or severe septic injury (SSI) induced by CLP. Results: Twenty-four hours post-CLP, mice from SSI group presented increased levels of cardiac calpain-1 and ubiquitin that were associated with reduced amounts of myocardial dystrophin and mTOR expression as compared to sham group. These results show a relationship between sarcolemal dystrophin loss/disruption and mTOR expression that is possible caused by enhanced levels of cardiac calpain-1 and ubiquitin. Conclusion: Our results reinforce the concept that calpain-1 activation represents a key target in dystrophin disruption behind cardiac dysfunction in severe sepsis/septic shock. Further studies are needed to elucidate this mechanism that may provide new interventional pathways to prevent septic cardiomyopathy.

Results: 104 cases showed concordance and 36 significant disagreement. In 3 cases a definite diagnosis could not be made because the coronary arteries were not included. The commonest discrepancy was between a pre-transplant diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and a histological diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease (17 cases). Nine other cases thought to be DCM had varied final diagnoses which will be described and illustrated. Other pre-transplant diagnoses not confirmed histologically included valve disease, left ventricular non-compaction and viral myocarditis. Full details will be provided. In some of these cases steroid therapy or surgery might have been a more suitable treatment than transplantation. Conclusion: 25 % (36/143) of the patients referred for heart transplant were not accurately diagnosed before the procedure and in a small but important minority of cases this could have affected management.",

            "text": "Objective: An unexpected autopsy finding in a 53-year-old man with newly diagnosed disseminated coloncancer. Method: A 53-year-old man who received chemotherapy for a T4 coloncancer was hospitalized with progressive dyspnea. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 50 % and dominating right heart chambers. During subsequent CT scan the patient suffered cardiac arrest and all attempts at resuscitation failed. Results: The pulmonary artery was blocked by a large thromboembolus and numerous peripheral emboli were found in both lungs. In the heart a vermicular thrombus (60 \u00d7 8 mm) was trapped in a patent foramen ovale. Conclusion: Cancer is one of the most common acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The prothrombotic state is exacerbated further by chemotherapy. Patients with active malignancy have a 4-fold to 7-fold higher incidence of symptomatic VTE than the general population. Foramen ovale remains patent in up to 27 % of the adult population. Among patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), the presence of a PFO is an independent predictor of death because of the risk of a paradoxical embolus (PDE). PFO is significant in the etiology of PDE if associated right-to-left shunt occurs -in our case increased right atrial pressure caused by high pulmonary vascular resistance. This case is a classical example of the association between cancer and venous thromboembolism, but with the additional unexpected finding of an impending paradoxical embolus across a patent foramen ovale. Objective: ACR is focally distributed in transplanted heart, thus its diagnosis depends on number and size of myocardial samples. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of samples quality on diagnosis of ACR in EMBs of transplanted heart in Polish one center material. Method: In 1350 EMBs from 212 patients who underwent heart transplantation between years 2001-2013, ACR was diagnosed according to ISHLT 2004 criteria. The size of specimens were categorized as follows: I -myocardial samples collectively >5 mm2 in size; II-myocardial samples 2-5 mm2 in size; III -myocardial sample/s <2 mm2 in size; IV-nondiagnostic EMB. The frequency of each ACR grade was assessed depending on myocardial sample quality. Objective: \"Papillary Fibroelastoma (FE)\" accounts for 7-10 % of benign primary heart tumours. Mainly found on valves [especially on the aortic (44.5 %), followed by mitral, tricuspid and finally pulmonary (8 %)]. It may be asymptomatic (incidentally detected by imaging techniques or during autopsy) or cause severe embolic complications. Authors present their medico-legal experience. Method: The reports of 2954 forensic autopsies (performed between 2011 and 2013, territorial area = 29.206 Km2, inhabitants = 2.595.540) were reviewed. Results: Two FE (0.07 %) were found. Both on males. One was aged 45 years-old; the tumour was on the pulmonary valve and he died of congestive heart failure (due to morbid obesity). The other was 53 years-old; the tumour was on the aortic valve and death was by hanging. Both FE were incidentally discovered during autopsy; had typical macro/microscopic features and measured <4 cm. Conclusion: This series shows: 1) how rare FE is; 2) its possible location/ origin on both sides of the heart (even on the least frequent valve); 3) and that Papillary Fibroelastoma must be searched for on natural and violent deaths, because although often an \"innocent bystander\", it certainly has medical relevance (embolic/ischaemic complications, sometimes dramatic or fatal) and legal importance (potential cause of falls, traffic or other accidents). Method: The authors reviewed the files of autopsies performed, at a Medico-Legal Institute, to victims aged \u2265 18 years-old (n = 1053) and deceased during the year 2010 in a territorial area of 29.206 Km2 with a population of 2.595.540 inhabitants. Data was then submitted to statistical analysis. Results: Sudden Death incidence in Adults was 45.3 % (n = 477). The main death causes were cardiovascular (76.7 %). Among the multiple risk factors disclosed, the most relevant were: male gender, old age, cardiovascular pathological personal antecedents (ischaemic). Conclusion: Sudden Death incidence in Adults is high. Thus, the control of known risk factors, the search/diagnosis of new ones, the evaluation of risk factors' association (which may increase Sudden Death risk) -either by first or secondary prevention strategies -is vital in the attempt to reduce the number of unexpected fatal events. Objective: This study analyzed morphological, ultrastructural changes and autophagy activation through the LC3B and Lamp-1 protein expression on heart of mice undergoing sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) followed by pneumonia (second-hit). Method: Male C57/Bl6 mice were subjected to sham or moderated septic injury (MSI) induced by CLP. Three days post-CLP, surviving mice were subjected to a second-hit with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). Twentyfour hours after second-hit morphology, LC3B and Lamp-1protein expression were evaluated in septic/control hearts. Results: Histopathological analysis showed scattered foci of myocytolysis with large amounts of autophagosomes; disrupted myofilamentar structure with intercalated disk alterations were more evident in CLP+Pa group than CLP. Increased myocardial LC3B and Lamp-1expression were more pronounced in septic than control groups. Additionally, was observed an increased mortality rate after second-hit when compared to mice submitted to CLP or pneumonia alone, suggesting that after second-hit sepsis is aggravated coinciding with increased mortality. Conclusion: This is the first report analyzing autophagy activation in Two-Hit sepsis model (more closely mimics clinical sepsis). New studies are essential to understand the participation of structural proteins as possible targets to proteolytic pathways during septic cardiomyopathy given the continued impact of cardiovascular involvement and the risks of secondary infection on morbidity and mortality.",

Method: This was a prospective study conducted on 70 patients of pleural, pericardial and peritoneal effusions, during the period between January 2012 to May 2013, presenting to the department of pathology, College of medical Sciences-Teaching hospital, Bharatpur. Results: The present study include 70 cases of pleural fluid, pericardial fluid and peritoneal fluid and analysis was done. 34 cases are of peritoneal fluid, 31 cases are of pleural fluid and five cases are of pericardial fluid. 59 cases diagnosed as chronic effusion (84. 28 %) . Six cases are diagnosed as inflammatory effusion (8.57 %) and five cases are of malignant effusion (7.14 %) on cytological evaluation. Out of five cases of malignant effusion two cases are of malignant mesothelioma. Fifty percent were turbid, 47 % were clear and 2.9 % were hemorrhagic in appearance. 52.9 % of effusions were exudative and 47.1 % of effusion were transuadative. After comparison of results of cytology with clinical diagnosis overall sensitivity of cytology was found to be 60 %, specificity as 96.92 % and accuracy as 94.28 %, while positive predictive value (PPV) was 60 % and negative predictive value was 96.92 %. The study was statistically significant (p value = 0.003). Conclusion: The most useful test in establishing the diagnosis of pleural, pericardial and peritoneal effusion is pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal fluids cytology and fluid cell count. Cytological study of the fluid is a complete diagnostic modality which aims at pointing out the etiology of effusion as well as, in certain cases, a means of prognostication of disease process.",

Method: A palpable lymph node in the right groin, approximately 1.5 cm was aspirated both under ultrasound guidance and direct according to the palpation. Air dried smears were used for preliminary stains with Diff-Quick to evaluate cell content and amount of cell material. Additional smears were routinely stained with MGG. Cell material was also suspended in LBC and prepared as cell block for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Smears were bloody and had a moderate amount of single and small groups of epitheloid cells with discrete nuclear abnormalities. IHC revealed negativity for epithelial markers whereas endothelial markers were positive. CT revealed enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes that were not investigated further. Conclusion: Excision biopsy revealed a vascular lesion whose morphology and immunophenotype were consistent with EHE. No other primary tumour was found. ; 16, 52, 45, 59, 31 in ASCH; 16, 52, 53, 51, 66 in LSIL and 16, 73, 18, 66, 45 in HSIL, for cytological results, and 16, 31, 51, 52, 58 in NLIM; 16, 52, 51, 66, 39 in CIN 1; 16, 52, 31, 59, 73 in CIN 2/3 and 16,52 in CC, for histological results. Conclusion: Our data shows that genotypes 16,52,31 are the most prevalent HR HPV in both cytological and histological abnormalities, comparable with other studies. Objective: We aimed to assess the amount of material in cell blocks, obtained with different needles in pancreatic EUS-FNA. Method: Diagnosis of primary pancreatic carcinoma was performed with EUS-FNA in 36 patients. We used one of the following needles: EchoTip 22G, EchoTip Procore 22G, EchoTip Procore 19G or Expect 19G Flexible. The material obtained was destined to make cell blocks using agar. Epithelium and stroma were separately quantified and divided in 0-1: absent-scanty, 2-3: moderate-abundant material. Results: In 10 patients EUS-FNA was performed with a 22G needle; 9 with 22G Procore; in 11 with flexible 19G, and in 6 with 19G Procore. Cell blocks contained abundant epithelium in 63,3 % cases using flexible 19G needle; in 33 % with the 19G Procore; in 10 % with 22G and 0 % with 22G Procore. Abundant stroma was obtained with the 19G flexible in 54,54 % cases; in 30 % with 22G; in 16 % with 19G Procore and in 11, 1 % with 22G Procore. Conclusion: Larger amount of material was obtained in the cell block of both epithelium and stroma by using the 19G needle. The acquisition of extra material can be used as a complementary diagnostic surplus in cytology for the performance of additional molecular techniques and biomarkers. Objective: Expose experience and statistics obtained in this center during 5 years of use of this procedure, emphasizing malignant pancreatic pathology. Method: All procedures performed routinely counted on physical presence of pathologist, quality and validity of material obtained was evaluated with Diff-Quick, part of it was fixed in alcohol to staining smear and needle wash was CytoRich. In those cases where material was obtained for cell block, this was fixed in formalin and/or CytoRich. Data analysis was carried out with a retrospective search from January 2008 to February 2015.",

In the subsequent analysis contrasting results with clinical data, all positive case was confirmed (100 % Objective: To compare sensitivity and specificity of fine needle aspiration (FNA) with or without core biopsy in the diagnosis of suspected epigastric neoplastic disease. Method: In 4-year period a total of 194 ultrasound-guided FNA biopsies of pancreas, liver and upper retroperitoneum were performed (32 endoscopic and 162 percutaneous), obtaining direct smears and/or cell block preparations; or processed as larger core biopsies when possible. Sensitivity and specificity of cytological and histological results were determined following standard statistical methods. Results: The most common were metastatic malignancies in liver (129 cases): 85 adenocarcinomas, 8 neuroendocrine tumours and 4 sarcomas and melanomas while 32 cases were hepatocellular carcinomas; followed by primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas (21 cases) and 2 neuroendocrine tumours. The retroperitoneal tumours comprised 4 sarcomas and 7 NHL and 1 metastatic squamocellular carcinoma. FNA cytology identified 54 of 63 malignant lesions (85.7 %) and FNA biopsy 133 of 151(88.1 %) when core sample was available. Cytologic evaluation showed high sensitivity (83.1 %) and 100 % specificity for malignant lesions while sensitivity was higher (88.1 %) when combined with core biopsies and they are similar to other studies (86 to 93.3 %). Conclusion: FNA cytology is rapid and precise method with high sensitivity and specificity, while core biopsy provides specific tumour subtyping. Objective: Salivary gland tumours (SGT) occur in pediatric patients with lower incidence than in adults but with higher rate of malignancy(36 %). Frequently locations: parotid(83 %), submandibular(15 %) and sublingual(10 %). An accurate preoperative diagnosis is important for planning the correct therapeutic approach. The objective is to demonstrate the utility of FNA of salivary gland tumours in pediatric and review our casuistry (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) . Method: 14 patients between 4 and18 years with SGT. In seven patients preoperative FNAwas performed by cytopathologist (Papanicolaou, Diff-Quick and block cell). Assessment of the overall series and cytohistological correlation (7 cases). Results: Localization: parotid(10) submandibular(2), sublingual(1) and intraoral salivary glands(1). Histological diagnosis: 8 pleomorphic adenomas (PA) 2 mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC), 2 acinar cell carcinoma (ACC), 1 granulocytic sarcoma and 1 Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cytohistological correlation of 7 cases: 100 %: 4(PA), 2(MEC), 1(ACC). Conclusion: SGT, although uncommon, occur in the pediatric age. In our series benign tumours predominate (PA) and among malignant are more frequent the MEC and ACC (coinciding with the literature). The preoperative FNA is very useful in the diagnosis of these injuries, being a simple, safe, fast, Little aggressive tool and well tolerated by pediatric patients without sedation. In our experience, the sensitivity and specificity is 100 %.",

Using this technology, normal cells are colored blue/green, while neoplastic cells are stained in red. This tinctorial difference coincides with clear morphological visualization properties. Computer aided detection (CAD) is a software that uses image-processing to estimate the likelihood that specific feature represents a disease process. In this study we tested whether CellDetect\u00ae can provide a basis for improved CAD. Method: 17 cytological smears with biopsy-confirmed diagnosis were used. Cases included 9 LSIL/HSIL, 4 urothelial cancers and 4 NILM. Smears were stained with CellDetect\u00ae and showed a full agreement with biopsy results. Smears were photographed and the images were submitted to chromatic statistical analysis and then to local morphology analysis. Results: Cells that showed positive red staining were analyzed based on pre-defined morphological parameters. The algorithm successfully identified all positive cells present on the image while excluding false signals resulting from cell clusters or inflammatory cells. Conclusion: This study establishes definite feasibility that the colormorphology combination of CellDetect\u00ae can be utilized for CAD. Large-scale blinded study is required to validate these promising results.",

Oikonomou * Hippokratio Hospital Athens, Dept. of Cytology, Greece Abstract: Collagenous spherulosis is a rare entity usually seen in association with benign breast lesions. It is often picked up incidentally with a reported incidence of about 0.2 % in cytological material. There are very few reports describing cytomorphological features of collagenous spherulosis. The presence of hyaline spherules surrounded by a single layer of benign myoepithelial cells is the hallmark of collagenous spherulosis on FNA. However, due to close cytological resemblance, it can be misdiagnosed as adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast. A 63 yearold woman presented with a left breast lesion. Fine needle aspiration was performed. The smears showed scanty cellularity comprising of cohesive clusters and a few branching fragments of benign ductal epithelial cells closely intermingled with many spherical, acellular homogenous hyaline globules. Few bare bipolar nuclei were noted in the background. A diagnosis of collagenous spherulosis associated with benign proliferative breast disease was made. Cytopathologists need to be aware of this entity in order to differentiate it from adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast which requires radical treatment. Objective: The presence of psammoma bodies in cervical cytologic smears of asymptomatic women has been associated with benign and malignant gynecologic lesions. The aim of our study was to emphasize their role as a cytologic marker of a rare ovarian tumour. Method: Case report: Pap smears were taken from a 54 -year old woman for routine screening. Microscopic examination showed cervical cells with no morphological abnormalities and a few psammoma bodies. Ultrasonography was recommended and it was normal. Six months later the Pap smears showed clusters of small atypical glandular cells, many psammoma bodies and foci of calcification. The diagnosis was serous papillary endometrial or ovarian adenocarcinoma. Clinical examination, tansvaginal ultrasonography and uterine curettage revealed only an endometrial polyps, presence of psammoma bodies, calcifications and endometrial atrophy. Unexpectedly 6 months later there was cytologic evidence of persistent psammoma bodies and calcifications in the smears. Results: A cervical cone biopsy was performed and histopathologic examination confirmed the cytologic diagnosis of malignancy. Metastatic invasive serous psammocarcinoma was observed with many psammoma bodies and calcifications. The ovary supposed to be the most possible primary site. Squamous cervical epithelium was normal. Surgical exploration was scheduled. Conclusion: The presence of psammoma bodies in Pap smears is a rare finding (0,00047 %) and most frequently associated with benign conditions. However since there is the danger of a possible coexistence of malignant or borderline tumours, this finding should not be underestimated or ignored even in the absence of clinical findings or malignant cells. Ovarian serous adenocarcinoma is the most common neoplasm followed by the uterine malignancy. Objective: Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is the production of mature blood elements outside of the bone marrow. EMH can occur as a compensatory result of a marrow replacing process or from marrow space occupying lesions or marrow fibrosis. Clinically, it can present as a solid mass, and therefore malignant neoplasms or metastatic disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis. It most commonly occurs in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes. Method: A 59-year-old man with jaundice was found to have a mass lesion with 7 cm in diameter in liver right lobe and peripancretic lymphadenopathies on abdomen ultrasonography (US). Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS FNA) biopsy was performed.",

Akalp \u00d6zmen, A. \u00c7arlnoglu * B\u00f6lge Egitim ve Arastirma Hastenesi, Dept. of Pathology, Erzurum, Turkey Objective: In last 1 year in our hospital, of 402 thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB). Method: 22 were considered benign and after thyroidectomy, malignancy was diagnosed. Results: Of these, 20 were papillary carcinomas (17 female, 3 male), 2 were follicular carcinomas (both were female). According to current standards, 5 % false negative diagnosis is high, but in a detailed study, the 12 patients were microcarcinomas (diameters smaller than 1 cm), five of them were well located tumours about 2 cm, but there were multiple nodules, that might have taken samples from benign nodules. In re-examination of 22 patients, just like the first examination, in 17, malignancy was not considered. In review of the other 5 materials, malignant histological diagnosis was made. 19 patients were females and 3 were males. Mean age of papillary carcinoma was 44.5, and follicular carcinoma was 33.5. A total mean age was 43. As a result, false negative outcomes of FNAB results showed no significant relationship in terms of age and sex. Objective: There are 3 categories related to risk of malignancy in Bethesda system; \"Suspicious for a follicular neoplasm\", \"Suspicious for malignancy\" and \"malignant\". When a cytologic material diagnosed as malignancy, but in the surgical pathologic examination it is benign, and in the re-examining of cytologic material if malignancy could not be find, it is false-positive diagnosis. Method: In our hospital, 4 of 402 patients applied for Bethesda system after thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy, malignancy was thought, but later in the thyroidectomy material there wasn't malignancy and all have received \"nodular goiter\" diagnosis. Results: Cytopathology of the 3(2 female 1 male) false-positive patients were \"suspected papillary carcinoma\", and 1 was (female) \"may be follicular carcinoma\". These diagnosis do not take place in Bethesda, however they strongly indicatemalignancy, and seems to be cautious. So, it is more probable than \"Suspicious for a follicular neoplasm\" and \"Suspicious for malignancy\", but not just a diagnosis of malignancy. All of the patients were female, the average age was 46. Conclusion: False positive cytology in thyroid surgery is considered riskier than false negative and 1 % false positive diagnoses can be considered higher than it should be. Objective: Mammary pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS) is regarded as a pre-invasive counterpart of PLC. However, the cytologic features of this tumour have yet to be sufficiently analyzed and definitively determined.",

Screening mammography revealed pleomorphic micro-calcifications in a segmental distribution in the upper outer portion of the left breast. We performed ultrasound-guided, fine needle aspiration (FNA) of an irregularly-shaped hypoechoic mammary area with hyperechoic spots. Results: The FNA specimen showed high cellularity in the necrotic background with calcifications. Singly dissociated tumour cells were prominent, whereas loosely-arranged tumour cell clusters were also observed. Large tumour cells were polygonal in shape and had eosinophilic, granular and/or foamy cytoplasm. The nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio was intermediate, and some tumour cells contained intra-cytoplasmic lumina and/or mucin with a 'signet-ring' morphology. The nuclei had a fine chromatin pattern and irregular shapes with nuclear grooves, frequently with distinct nucleoli. Binucleated tumour cells were occasionally present. Mitotic figures were not uncommon. Histologically, the diagnosis of PLCIS, accompanied by comedo-like necroses with dystrophic calcification, was confirmed based on the mastectomy specimen. Immunohistochemically, cancer cells were negative for E-cadherin and positive for 34\u03b2E12 and GCDFP15. Conclusion: Herein, we showed the characteristic cytopathological findings of mammographically-detected PLCIS. Objective: A 58-year-old female patient with postmenopausal bleeding was admitted, endometrial thickening was seen by USG but she did not accept probe curettage so, only cervical smear could be taken. Results: At cervical smear, atypical cells with prominent nucleoli containing irregular chromatin which formed three-dimensional groups and small papillary structures, nuclear hyperchromasia and coarsening on a dirty floor were seen and reported as \"malignant cytology findings are consistent with glandular malignancy. Endometrial and endocervical curettage recommended\". A week later macroscopically about 3 cc volume of hemorrhagic curettage material was histopathologically examined and atypical cells with prominent nucleoli and hyperchromatic nuclei were observed to create a papillary configuration. These papillary structures consisted of atypical hobnail cells. At immunohistochemical staining, positivity with Pan-CK, vimentin and P-16 were seen. There was a strong expression of P-53. It was reported as \"Serous carsinoma\". Serous papillary type of endometrial carcinoma is seen in 5-10 % and usually develops from atrophic epithelium. Conclusion: Cervical smear test, is not for diagnosis, it is for screening. There is no method for screening and early diagnosis of endometrial cancer. At cervical smear material, the presence of cells falling from the endometrium may be a guide for further examination of endometrial cancer.",

            "text": "Objective: Cytology diagnostic in bladder pathology is difficult. There is high specificity 62-97,4 %, and low sensitivity 20,8-84 %. Method: We evaluate 300 patient with different bladder pathology. After collection whole voided urine sample was double centrifuged: first time during 10 min by usual centrifuge 3000 r/min and secondly using Shandon Cytospin-3 (\u00abThermo Shandon Limited\u00bb, UK) 5 min by 2000 r/min. Results: Using this approach cells were concentrate on glass up to 20 time more compared usual technique, but final cellularity depends on quantity of urine and presence of inflammation, cancer recurrence or other kind of pathology. Diagnostic value of cytological method grows from 45 to 92 %. Conclusion: Using this approach we can evaluate urine cytology sample faster and accurately than conventional sample preparation. Objective: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare vascular malignancy of intermediate grade that presents in a variety of sites, including soft tissue, bone, lung, liver, pleura and peritoneum, skin, lymph nodes, stomach, and brain. EHE can metastasize, with reported rates up to 30 % and mortality from 13 to 65 %. Method: A 32 year old female presented with dyspnea and pain in the thoracic and abdominal region. Thoracic x-ray revealed \"white lung\" and pleural fluid. Cytology of pleural fluid with immunohistochemistry on cell blocks was performed. Results: Morphological examination revealed scattered single cells and small groups with distinct nuclear atypia, suspicious of malignancy. Cell groups demonstrated intracytoplasmatic vacuoles or lumina. Cells were positive for vascular markers CD31 and CD34, cytokeratinAE1/AE3 and vimentin, and negative for all other markers, including calretinin, melanA, HCG, CD45 and BerEp4. The diagnosis was reported as suspicious of malignancy of unknown origin, possible sarcoma. Multidisciplinary discussion exposed patient had been suffering from pain in her ankle. Bone, and later pleural biopsy showed tumour compatible with EHE. The patient received chemotherapy but died few weeks later due to respiratory failure. Conclusion: EHE is a rare, potentially serious, and diagnostically challenging disease. Hence awareness should be paid to this entity. Objective: To evaluate and describe cytologic features of germ cell tumours (GCTs), both primary and metastasis from gonadal sites, in FNA cytology. Method: Aspirates from 9 GCTs (6 testicular and 3 extragonadal) with adequate cytologic material were analyzed with its clinical features and cytologic smears. The smears were assessed for background, cellularity, cell patterns, cytologic features and immunohistochemical staining. Cytohistologic correlation was done in all cases. Results: We observed morphologic features that allow to identify each tumour in 6 cases: seminoma (2), embryonal carcinoma (1), choriocarcinoma (1) and mixed GCTs (2) -one with embryonal carcinoma, Yolk sac tumour and teratoma components and other with embryonal carcinoma and Yolk sac components-. Three cases were difficult to diagnose: Yolk sac tumour (2) and mixed GCTs with seminoma and Yolk sac tumour components (1). Conclusion: Seminoma and embryonal carcinoma have cytologic features that allow its diagnostic in FNA cytology unlike Yolk sac tumour. The variant anaplastic seminoma may be indistinguishable from embryonal carcinoma. Organized clusters of epithelial and/or mesenchymal cells suggest teratoma. Mixed GCTs represent a diagnostic challenge in cytology because of sampling error on FNA. The cell bloc allows immunohistochemical study, helpful in the diagnosis of these tumours. Also, clinical data and blood test are relevant.",

            "text": "The use of fine needle aspiration cytology as an additional tool for diagnosis of cherubism: A case report Objective: The aim of the study was to demonstrate the use of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) as an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of cherubism through a case report. Method: A 10-year-old girl presented bilateral symmetric mandibular increased. Image exams revealed well-defined bilateral multilocular radiolucent lesions in the angle and mandibular branches, as well as a large unilocular lesion in the mandibular symphysis. The results of laboratory tests (blood count, serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase) were normal. On occasion, an incisional biopsy was performed in the symphysis, and the histopathology diagnosis was cherubism. Three years later, the patient returned with a new lesion in the anterior maxilla, with no defined edges and causing root resorption of incisors. FNAC was carried out with a 24-gauge needle attached to a 10 ml syringe. Results: The exam showed typical multinucleated giant cells, besides some fibroblasts, with no evidence of cellular atypia. These features are not specific for the diagnosis of cherubism, but, if they are analyzed together with other data, it is possible to make the diagnosis. Conclusion: FNAC, when combined with clinical and radiological data and laboratory tests, is a useful, safe and effective method that plays an important role in the diagnosis of cherubism. Objective: Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm with only a limited number of cases reported. The majority of cases occur in extranodal sites such as the intestinal tract, skin or soft tissues. However, regarding the intestinal tract, primary gastric involvement is exceptional. Method: We report a 48 year-old male patient who was admitted for marked weight loss, night sweats, lethargy and cramp-like abdominal pain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a 10 cm ulcero-fungating lesion located in the gastric fundus which extended both towards the cardia and the body region. Results: Microscopically, tumour cells showed eosinophilic, abundant cytoplasm, convoluted, overlapping nuclei, vesicular chromatin and one or two visible nucleoli. Pleomorphic or multinucleated tumour giant cells were frequently observed. Immunohistochemical staining showed tumour cells were strongly reactive for CD68 and vimentin and focally positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and S100. Tumour cells were negative for epithelial cell markers (CK7, EMA, CEA). Other negative markers included CD117, p63, HMB-45 and Ki67. Conclusion: Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that if present in an uncommon site can mimic other entities. Careful histopathological analysis and consideration of differential diagnosis are therefore imperative as this neoplasm has a poor outcome. Objective: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Ileocolonic and colonic/anorectal involvement is the most common, while stomach as a primary isolated site is very unusual. Method: We report here two cases of gastric CD diagnosed in our institution. One is a 72-year-old male that presented epigastric pain and diffuse redness with small nodules on endoscopy. The other case, reports a 65-year-old female that presented nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain and multiple gastric ulcerations on endoscopy. Results: Macroscopically, the first resection specimens had a thickened area of 2 cm diameter within the stomach wall with a slightly increased gray color, while the second case had multiple erosions and ulcerations of the mucosa. Histologically we found ulcerations of the mucosa with necrotic debris underlying non-caseating granulomas composed of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells, and a polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate in both cases; in the second case, we report extensive intestinal metaplasia and focal areas of invasive carcinoma in the submucosa. The lymphatic nodules were free of tumour with reactive morphology. Conclusion: Isolated gastric CD is a very rare entity. When diagnosis is a matter of great concern, the efforts should be diverted to confirm the diagnosis and specifically to search for dysplasia or neoplastic changes due to the higher risk of malignancy associated with Crohn's disease. Objective: Mucin -1 (MUC-1) possesses a protective capacity which participates in composing the barrier of \"mucus-bicarbonate\". The aim of the study was to assess the expression of MUC-1 in patients with and without gastric premalignant conditions. Method: 62 patients were prospectively enrolled in the study. Five biopsy samples were obtained from each of the patients according to the updated Sydney system. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, alcian blue, Giemsa and immunohistochemically with MUC-1. Results: Loss of MUC-1, either patchy or complete, was noted in 52 % of the cases. Obtained results showed decreased MUC-1 expression in patients with atrophic gastritis compared to patients with superficial gastritis (p < 0.001). In addition, in patients with intestinal metaplasia, the MUC-1 was significantly downregulated (p < 0.01). In patients with H.pylori gastritis the MUC-1 expression was lower compared to patients without H.pylori infection (p = 0.004). Furthermore, the MUC-1 expression was significantly lower in the mucosa of lesser curvature compared to the greater curvature of both antrum and corpus. Conclusion: MUC-1 expression was decreased in the gastric premalignant conditions, which is more prominent in the lesser compared to the greater curvature. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathological lesions in gastroenteritis, associated to canine norovirus, suggesting the possibility of a novel model for human infection.",

Apoptosis studies combined the immunohistochemical detection of cytochrome c and the DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay. Results: The microscopic findings revealed severe epithelial detachment, mucosal loss and hypertrophy of all small intestinal layers. Also, an intense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate within lamina propria of small intestine proximal segments were seen, very similar to IBD lesional pattern. Conclusion: Canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous group of chronic gastrointestinal disorders with unknown etiology, immunologically-mediated, similar to human IBD. With this study it is tempting to hypothesize that canine norovirus could be significantly evolved in the complex aetiopathogenesis of IBD, identically in human Crohn disease -an example of human IBD, which could highlight the relevance of canine norovirus in the aetiopathogenesis of this chronic condition. Objective: Severe small intestinal atrophy with subsequent malabsorption and emaciation due to Giardia Lamblia infection is uncommon. Method: A 53 year old patient presented with severe weight loss and foul-smelling watery diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed multiple polyps in cecum and ascending colon and biopsies were also taken from the duodenal mucosa. Results: Histopathological examination of duodenum showed severe villous blunting with crypt hyperplasia and increased CD3 intraepithelial lymphocytes. Concurrent nodular lymphoid hyperplasia in lamina propria of the mucosa was observed. Several trophozoites of the parasite Giardia Lamblia were noticed on the surface of the mucosa. CD138 plasmatocytic marker did not detect any plasma cells in the lamina propria. Colon polyps were of regenerative nature with abundant eosinophilic leukocytes although the parasite was not detected in colon specimens. The patient was diagnosed with Giardia Lamblia infection, secondary malabsorption syndrome and common variable immunodeficiency. gamma-globulin substitution and antibiotic therapy resulted in gradual weight gain due to eradication of the parasite and restoration of small bowel villous architecture. Conclusion: Parasitic infections with or without underlying immunodeficiency should always be taken in consideration in cases of malabsorption due to small bowel atrophy.",

Specimens of intestinal wall were investigated with histochemistry in 10, 30 days, 3 and 6 month after experiment's beginning. Results: It was carried out that intestine wall prominently injures with abdominal cavity high pressure. During the first month after beginning of the experiment acute and most often reversible changes are being spread: acute blood circulation abnormalities and intestinal wall oedema, secretion strengthening and alterative mucosa destructions. After 3 months intestine wall destructions become more resistant, level of secretion decreases. In 6 months atrophy and sclerosis of intestinal wall appear, that allows estimating these changes as irreversible. Objective: Sarcomatoid Carcinoma (SC), an aggressive and unusual tumour in the gastrointestinal tract, is rarely reported in the small intestine (30 cases to date). We report two cases, located in duodenum and ileum respectively. Method: Case 1: A 50 years old male presented with dyspepsia. On CT: a hipogastric huge mass of 14 cm from duodenum and involving liver, galdbladder and colon. A diagnosis of SC was made from endoscopical samples. Post-quimiotherapy parcial resection was performed. Case 2: A 57 years old female with abdominal pain. On CT and surgery, an ileal mass of 8-9 cm is observed. Radiologically, GIST was suspected in both cases. Results: Both, histopathologically are ulcerated with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage, and pleomorphic/discohesive tumour cells with a similar inmunohistochemical profile was detected (see table) . Conclusion: This rare variant of the small intestine carcinoma have poor prognosis, is highly aggressive and most patients present with an advanced disease. A wide range immunohistochemical panel should be performed for the differential diagnosis with the more frequent GIST. Objective: The adenocarcinoma of minor duodenal papilla are most rare, with only a few cases described so far. Method: Due to low MDP adenocarcinoma incidence, we offer our clinical observation as follows. Results: A man, G., 51 with obstructive jaundice syndrome. EGD on admission: Large deep ulceration with underlying infiltrated edges around immediately after superior flexure on posteromedial wall. Ulceration size circa 3 cm, its floor covered with thrombosed vessels; contact petechiae. No bleeding on examination. Mucosal infiltration extends to MajDP enlarged longitudinal fold. MajDP itself is enlarged, oval-shape, 2 \u00d7 3 cm, swells in duodenal lumen, dense consistency, 2 mm opening, looks downward to complicate drastically cannulation. Abdominal CT: Liver size and parenchyma density normal. Intra-hepatic bile ducts dilatated, with up to 8 mm for lobar ducts. CBD dilatated up to 11 mm, coning at terminal section level. Gallbladder collapsed. Pancreas normal size. Wirsung's duct not dilatated. Parapancreatic mass not infiltrated. Gross: On duodenum opening through the anti-ampullar (crest, a 1.5 \u00d7 1.7 cm infiltrative ulcerous tumour was revealed with uneven dense boundary 1.5 cm proximally of MajDP. CBD opened into MajDP. No change in the ampullar zone. Micro: Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of MDP, PB type. Stage III (pT4, pN1, pM0) . Conclusion: Currently, prognosis for patients with MDP adenocarcinoma is unclear, yet reports are available on similar prognosis for ampullary carcinoma. Objective: Comparison of the diagnostic value of three H. pylori detecting methods (Giemsa, Immunohistochemistry (IHC), FISH); whether their sensitivity correlates with active chronic gastritis and with H. pylori infection associated structural mucosal changes. Method: We examined 2981 gastric biopsies, defined the presence of active chronic gastritis and/or H. pylori infection associated structural mucosal changes. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of Giemsa, IHC and the H. pylori FISH test. Results: Of the 2981 cases 687 (23 %) were positive with Giemsa, 795 (26,6 %) with IHC, 788 (26,4 %) with FISH. Their sensitivity and specificity were 83,3 and 98,9 % with Giemsa, 98,8 and 99,3 % with IHC and 98 and 99,6 % with FISH, respectively. We did not find any correlation between method sensitivity and the presence of structural mucosal alterations. Nevertheless the sensitivity of Giemsa showed positive correlation with active inflammation; 64 % of the IHC/FISH positive cases which did not show active inflammation were negative with Giemsa.",

Objective: Monomorphic CD56+ intestinal T-cell lymphoma(MTCL), also referred as type II enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma, is an uncommon type of lymphoma of the intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes. The etiology of this disease is unknown and it appears to occur sporadically with no association to celiac disease. Method: A 63 year-old male, with no relevant medical history, presented with intestinal perforation that underwent a segmental ileectomy. Postoperative clinical and imagiological examination revealed hepatic and lung nodules and a parotid mass. Partial parotidectomy was performed. Results: Macroscopic examination of the ileum showed an ulcerative and infiltrative multifocal white lesion with perforation of the visceral peritoneum. The neoplastic cells were small to medium-size, monomorphic, with hyperchromatic nuclei and diffusely infiltrated the intestinal wall. Adjacent mucosa showed prominent intraepithelial lymphocytosis. The parotid evaluation revealed a poorly defined white lesion with similar microscopic findings. In both cases, the neoplastic cells expressed CD3, CD56 and focal CD20 and were negative for CD5, CD10 and EBER. A diagnosis of MTCL of the ileum with involvement of the parotid was rendered. Conclusion: MTLC can occur without symptoms and present as an emergency associated with perforation. It can course with multifocal involvement of the intestine or extra-intestinal dissemination and the prognosis is poor.",

The mean age of developing extramedullary plasmacytoma is 55 years, with a female predominance. Solitary EMP of the mesentery is extremely rare with \u03bfnly four cases reported in the literature so far. Method: A 47-year-old man presented with severe epigastric pain and constant vomiting. On clinical examination he was tender in the epigastrium. Abdominal CT showed a large epigastric mass, completely replacing the pancreas and displacing the stomach anteriorly and to the left. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a mesenteric nodal mass obstructing the third part of the duodenum was revealed. Biopsies were taken. Results: Histological examination showed morphological and immunohistochemical features of plasmatocytoma. This was followed by a full staging for myeloma which was negative. Finally, a diagnosis of solitary EMP of the mesentery was set. Conclusion: EMP is a plasma cell neoplasm without bone marrow involvement. In 17 to 33 % of plasmacytomas, the extramedullary disease will develop into multiple myeloma. More than 80 % of EMPs arise in the rich lymphatic tissue of the upper respiratory tract. Solitary EMPs are highly radiosensitive with a 10-year overall survival rate of 70 %. Objective: We aimed to find a correlation between human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene amplification and clinicopathological factors in gastric cancer patients. Method: We performed a retrospective study on surgical resection specimens from gastric cancer patients operated in Emergency County Hospital Timisoara, Romania, between 2010 and 2014. Clinicomorphological data and immunohistochemical HER2 expression were assessed. Results: We identified 53 patients (36 male and 17 female, mean age 62, 98). HER2 was overexpressed (3+) in 6 cases (11,32 %), 10 (18.87 %) were equivocal (2+) and 37 (69.81 %) negative (0/1+). We observed HER2 overexpression in five patients with intestinal type adenocarcinoma (9,43 %) (p = 0,3252) and in 1 case (1,88 %) of diffuse type. All patients with HER2 positivity were men and in advanced stage disease (>pT2, p = 0,4463). HER2 positivity was identified especially in moderate histological grade (p = 0,2619). No significant differences were found in HER2 positivity regarding age and lymph node involvement. We observed a higher rate of HER2 overexpression in patients with lymphovascular invasion (83,3 %). Conclusion: Although we did not notice any significant statistical correlation between the HER2 overexpression and clinicopathological factors, our results suggest that patients with advanced stage, moderately differentiated intestinal type adenocarcinoma are candidates for anti HER2 therapy.",

Objective: Gastric cancer (GC) is still fourth most common malignancy in the world. Therefore, besides the clinicopathological factors known to be prognostic markers, new independent parameters like antigen presented cells, growth factors and some polymorphisms are being investigated. The aim of the study was to assess the expression and significance of HER2/neu, TGF-beta 1, his receptor -RII and mature CD83-positive dendritic cells (DCs), and Ile/Val single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of HER2 in GC specimens. Method: Thirty six cases of GC were investigated immunohistochemically for HER2/neu, TGF-beta 1, TGF-betaRII and CD83 expression and with RFLP -PCR analysis for Ile/Val of HER2 SNP at codon 655 in 30 samples. The results were compared with clinical and pathological parameters of investigated patients. Results: All patients were negative for HER2/neu expression. RFLP -PCR analysis showed that 66.7 % of the patients with metastases had AG genotype vs. 33.3 % were with AA genotype (\u03c7 = 4.76, \u0440 = 0.029). Also, 95.2 % of TGF-beta1 positive cases had low infiltration with CD83positive DCs in tumour border while 47.6 % from TGF-beta1 negative samples had high infiltration (\u03c7 = 9.97, \u0440 = 0.002). Conclusion: Our results suggest that SNP in HER2 codon 655 and investigation of DCs infiltration and some factor expression have important prognostic significance for the patients GC. Recent studies have shown the loss of ARID1A expression in gastric carcinomas may have a prognostic importance. In our study, we purposed to evaluate the interactions between ARID1A loss and HER2 status in gastric carcinomas. Method: ARID1A expressions were studied in 113 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded gastric carcinoma specimens and its association with different pathological and clinical parameters was evaluated. Results: Loss of ARID1A expression was detected in 54 (47.6 %) of 113 cases. ARID1A expressions were normal in most HER2 positive tumours (n = 20, %64,5), while defective expression of ARID1A was detected in HER2 negative tumours (n = 43, 52.4 %). Statistical significant association was not found between ARID1A expression and features of gastric tumours. Contrary, there was significant association between ARID1A expression and stage of HER2 negative tumours (p = 0.039). Conclusion: Identification of specific biomarkers is very important for prediction of clinical outcome in gastric tumours. We demonstrated loss of ARID1A expression in HER2 negative gastric cancer negatively correlate with stage. These results suggest that ARID1A may play a role in the biology of HER2 negative gastric cancers. Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most common primary mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, typically expressing CD117, CD34 and DOG1, composed of spindle, epithelioid or mixed cellularity. Method: We performed a retrospective study on 21 cases of confirmed GISTs from our archive, aiming to establish morphological and immunohistochemical correlations. The samples were stained for CD117, CD34, DOG1 and Ki67. Results: The cases showed spindle cell morphology in 66,66 % of cases, epithelioid in 14,28 % and mixed pattern in 19 %. CD117 was positive in 90.47 % of GISTs, CD34 in 95,23 %, DOG1 in 12 of 13 cases tested and Ki67 was >5 % in tumour cells in 28,57 % cases. Two GIST were C-kit negative, one CD34 and DOG1 and the other only CD34 positive. Both showed spindle cellularity. One had over 5 mitoses/50 HPF. Ki67 correlated with mitotic index in 61,9 % of cases. The pediatric GIST had a mixed pattern, intermediate risk of progression, and expressed both CD117 and CD34. Conclusion: CD117 is the most reliable marker for diagnosis of GIST. In negative cases, DOG1 may support the diagnosis. The mitotic index was poorly correlated with Ki67 expression, confirming the former as a better parameter in evaluating tumour risk progression.",

            "text": "Objective: Esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) do not show a specific immunohistochemical expression profile that may correlate with aggressiveness or aid in differential diagnosis. We characterized the immunophenotype of EAC by analyzing a range of markers of gastro-intestinal and other \"site\" specific differentiation. Method: 117 primary resected EACs were included. A next-generation tissue microarray was stained with antibodies against CDX2, CK7, CK20, ER, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, NapsinA, PAX8, PSA, Synaptophysine, and TTF1. Results: Tumours could be categorized according to the expression of CK7 and CK20. Ninety-eight cases (84 %) were CK7 positive, 84 cases (72 %) were CK20 positive, and 73 cases (63 %) expressed both markers. Positivity for CK20 was linked to the expression the \"intestinal\" differentiation markers MUC2 (p = 0.037) and CDX2 (p = 0.021). Tumours expressing CK7 showed a trend towards unfavorable clinical outcome (p = 0.095). A minority of tumours expressed markers unrelated to the anatomical site (e.g. TTF-1, NapsinA, PSA). Conclusion: EACs do not feature a distinct expression profile. The majority of tumours express CK7 and/or CK20, with a strong correlation between the expression of the \"intestinal\" markers CK20, MUC2 and CDX2. Expression of CK7 may be associated with a more aggressive growth. The expression of unrelated \"site\"-specific markers in EAC warrants caution when analyzing metastases of unknown origin. Objective: Gastric carcinoma with lymphoid stroma (GCLS), also known as medullary carcinoma is a rare gastric neoplasia charaterized by poorly developed tubular structures with a prominent stromal lymphocytic infiltration. More than 80 % of GCLS are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. We present a 76-year-old male patient with GCLS. Method: A 76 year old man applied to hospital with weight loss in a 3 months. Gastroscopy revealed an ulcerated mass at the cardia and the biopsy revealed undifferentiated adenocarcinoma. He underwent a total gastrectomy. Results: An ulcerated tumour with pushing border limited to the subserosa and dense lymphocytic infiltrate was detected microscopically. Sheets of polygonal cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent infiltrating lymphocyt were observed. Tumour cells were positive with cytokeratin, negative with synaptophysin, choromogranin, CD56. In-situ hybridization analysis of EBV latency associated RNA (EBER) was positive in lymphoid and tumour cells. The disease stage was T3N0M0. He had no relapse until now within 6 months of follow-up with systemic treatment. Conclusion: GCLS forms 5 % of all gastric carcinomas and is rare tumour with an appearance similar to poorly differentiated carcinoma but its clinical behavior is similar to well differentiated gastric carcinoma. GCLS with lymphocytic infiltration is associated with two conditions: EBV infection and microsatellite instability (MSI). Our case GCLS showed positivity with EBER.",

            "text": "Early cancer of the stomach. Modern approaches to morphological diagnosis L. Mikhaleva * , A. Birukov Method: We report a retrospective study of 26 gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumour cases identified over a period of 14 years (2000-2013) . They were graded according to the new 2010 WHO classification. Results: The average age was 49.64 years. There were a higher number in male. The most common location was stomach. According to 2000 WHO classification, the cases were devided into well-differentiated endocrine tumour (42.31 %), well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (50 %), poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (7.69 %). According to the new classification (2010), these tumours are reclassified in 16 neuroendocrine tumours G1, 6 neuroendocrine tumours G2 and 4 neuroendocrine carcinoma. Distant metastasis were presnt in 38 % of patients. Survival rate was 100 % at 12 months. Conclusion: Those tumours have different prognosis. It is important to distinguish well-differentiated endocrine tumours whose grows slowly and poorly differentiated endocrine tumours characterized by aggressiveness and speed evolution. Objective: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) (carcinoids) of the gastrointestinal and pancreatic region are considered negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), some studies demonstrating even the specificity of TTF-1 for pulmonary origin in NETs. Method: We present the case of a 47 years old male with a 14 mm diameter ampullary tumour, multiple hepatic metastases and no pulmonary lesions on CT scan. Hepatic metastases were present in both lobes with intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts dilatation. Results: We analyzed two biopsies, from the ampullary tumour and from a hepatic metastasis. Microscopic aspects revealed a predominant nested and trabecular proliferation, with some gland-like features. The tumour cells had moderate amount of cytoplasm, round monomorphic nuclei with \"salt and pepper\" chromatin and low mitotic rate (1/10HPF in ampullary tumour; 3/10HPF in metastasis). Tumour cells were chromograninA, synaptophysin, CD56, CK8/18 and CK7 positive, CDX2 focally positive, CK20 negative and 15 % Ki67 index. TTF-1 had a strong nuclear positivity in 90 % of tumour cells. In clinical context, the final diagnosis was grade 2 primary ampullary NET with hepatic metastases. Conclusion: The positivity for TTF-1 in an ampullary NET with hepatic metastases may represent a pitfall in establishing a correct histopathological diagnosis without clinical correlations. Objective: To carry on screening of ZES under gastric NET and to study it's clinical and morphological features. Method: The gastric mucosal biopsies and surgical specimens from 21 patients with NETs of the stomach were investigated. The usual methods and the IHC study were used. Results: From 2 to 6 biopsies of the gastric mucosa were needed for diagnostic in 62 % of considered cases. Hyperplastic epithelial, muscle and endocrine cells changes were revealed. Eighteen tumours were considered as G1 NET and 3 G 2-3, with invasion in the stomach muscular layer. The average age of patients was 50,2. 4 patients (19 %) demonstrated different ZES manifestations. Manifestations of aggressive peptic ulcers course in the form of complications (i.e. bleeding, stomach obstruction, diarrhea) seemed to be key clinic symptoms. Among them were three men. The average age of patients was 25. Tumours had small size (0,1-1,0 cm) and were detected either during surgery (25 %) or after gastrectomy (50 %). NET diagnosis was raised histologically, verified and corrected by IHC studies (gastrinoma). Conclusion: Gastric NET accompanied with ZES can be very small and multiple. This demands to make multiple parallel sections of the resected stomach and thorough tumours search. Method: In our study we had 24 cases of DD -16 males and 8 females aging from 19 to 79. All patients entered the clinic with a gastrointestinal bleeding. Results: During endoscopical research an erosive artery was found in the affected region, which protruded the stormachs lumen, shaped like a papilla with light-colored central field among normaly colored mucous membrane. In morphological research these patients demonstrated typical morphological characters of disease's manifestation -stomach's mucous membrane atrophy with multiple hemorrhages in it's wall. In the submucosaabnormal and malformed blood vessels with thickened walls and intraluminal organized thrombi. Also, tortuous artery with a preserved muscular tunic approximately 1,5 mm in diameter can be found. It goes through submucosa and closely sides with mucosa. aliber of the vessel does not match his placement. Severe dilated artery appers normal. There is no indication of inflammation process in mucosa, dystrophic calcification, deep ulceration of the vessel's wall, penetraton in it's own muscular tunic, vasculitis, indication of organizing aneurism and atherosclerosis. Thrombus commonly adjoins a defect in the vessel, protruding above mucosa. Ulcer in mucosa -without inflammatory reaction, typical for peptic ulcer. Fibrosis around defect is absent. Conclusion: In immunohistochemical research in the pathologically formed vessel area we found a highly positive expression of vimentin, \u0421D34, VEGF; mild expression of smooth muscular actine, ambiguous expression of TGF\u03b2, FGF\u03b2, CD105; negative reaction with PCNA; Ki 67 5-10 %.",

This study aimed to demonstrate possible connections between \u03b2-catenin and EGFR with histological type and biological behavior in ampullary adenocarcinomas. Method: We studied 47 consecutively resected ampullary adenocarcinomas immunohistochemically with antibodies against \u03b2-catenin and EGFR. Results: Eighteen carcinomas were of intestinal and 29 of pancreatobiliary type. Disease stage (TNM) was 0 in two patients, I in two, II in 16 and III in 27. The differences in the expression of both \u03b2-catenin and EGFR between intestinal and pancreatobiliary type carcinomas were not statistically significant. Positive predictive value of \u03b2-catenin and EGFR for the intestinal type was 64 and 38 % respectively. \u03b2-catenin expression was associated with lower tumour grade (p = 0.0527) while EGFR was not. No significant connection was found between EGFR and \u03b2-catenin expression and disease stage. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical expression of EGFR and \u03b2-catenin in ampullary carcinomas is not useful in differentiating intestinal from pancreatobiliary type. \u03b2-catenin expression is possibly associated with more favorable biological behavior. Objective: Gastric cancer (GC) remains the fourth most common type of cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The aim of the study was to compare the gastric cancer histopathological subtypes and evaluate the correlation between the histopathological and clinical parameters. Method: 80 subjects undergoing gastric cancer surgical treatment carcinoma were enrolled in the study. The patients were treated in Riga East University Hospital in 2014. The surgical specimens were grossly and microscopically analyzed. The tumour classification was assessed according to WHO 2010 classification. Results: Obtained results showed that the tubular adenocarcinoma was observed in 35 % of cases, signet ring cell carcinoma-in 30 %, undiferentiated carcinoma in 20 %, papillary adenocarcinoma in 10 % and mutinous carcinoma in 5 % of cases. The positive correlation between the tumour size and the numbers of metastatic lymph nodes, Bormann classification, gastric atrophy, lymphovascular invasion was observed. Furthermore, the negative correrlation between the Lauren classification and intestinal metaplasia, tumour vascular invasion was observed. In addition, the positive correlation between the Bormann classification and tumour vascular, perineural invasion and the numbers of metastatic lymph nodes was observed. Conclusion: The tumour histopathological characteristics correlated with the clinical course and prognosis.",

            "text": "Concordance of the results of detection of HER2 amplification in gastric adenocarcinoma using CISH and FISH methods. Objective: To determine the degree of concordance between positive HER2 gene amplification detected by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Method: Tumour tissue samples from 96 patients with radical operation of gastric adenocarcinoma were tested by immunohistochemical methods (IHC) with Hercep test, Code K5204, (DACO, USA), gene amplification was tested by CISH method using HER2 pharm-Dx Kit, Code SK109 (DAKO, USA), and FISH method was carried out by microarray technique using PATH Vysion HER2 (Abbott Vysis, USA). Kappa coefficient was used to determine the concordance rate of the results from CISH and FISH methods. Results: The following results were found on the IHC: score 0-52,1 %, score 1-24,0 %, score 2-10,4 %, score 3-13,5 % of the patients. In all tumours whith 3+ the HER2 gene amplification exists using CISH and FICH methods. In the category tumours with 2+ the HER2 gene amplification was found in 3 patients using CISH method, and in five patients using FISH method. Kappa = 0,78 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: FISH method is more sensitive and it is recommended in routine practice for determining HER2 gene amplification in the patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Objective: This study was conducted to investigate whether human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status are independent prognostic factors for advanced gastric cancer patients. Method: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples were examined for HER2 and EGFR using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additionally, gene amplification was examined using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER2. Positivity was defined as an IHC score of 3+ or an IHC score of 2+/FISH positive for HER2, and an IHC score of 2+ or 3+ for EGFR. Objective: \u0394Np63-a p63 isoform suggested to be highly specific for squamous/basal cells, which is thought to antagonize the activity of TAp63 and p53. Cyclooxygenase (COX) is a key enzyme in arachidonic acid metabolism. COX-2 expression may contribute to the synthesis of prostanoids, which relate to carcinogenesis and tumour progression. Method: We performed an immunohistochemical analysis of COX-2 and P40 in 85 human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues and evaluated the relationship with lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, depth of tumour invasion, localizations, age, size, histopathological grading, and TNM clinical classification. Results: There was a relation between expression of P40 ve COX-2 and differentiation grade, lymph node metastasis, stage and tumour size but not with vascular invasion. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical detection of expression of P40 ve COX-2 in the primary esophageal squamous cell tumour may be useful for the prediction of a poor prognosis. Objective: Heat shock-related 70 kDa protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HSPA2 gene. HSPA2 is expressed in various tumours and in certain types of somatic tissues. is important for cancer cell growth and metastasis. However, the status of HSPA2 expression and its prognostic significance in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) remain unknown. Method: Archived and paraffin-embedded samples were obtained from 85 patients with a diagnosis of ESCC, who underwent surgical resection during the period of 2007 to 2014 in Ataturk University, Faculty of Medicine. The expression of HSPA2 in ESCC was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Results: HSPA2 mRNA and protein were overexpressed in ESCC tissues compared to paired adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.001). Clinicopathological analysis showed that HSPA2 expression was significantly correlated with tumour size (P = 0.01), histological differentiation (P = 0.03), and tumour stage (P = 0.001), lymph node metastases and recurrence, respectively (all, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that overexpression of HSPA2 in esophagus cancer is associated with aggressive progression and poor prognosis and that HSPA2 may be served as a prognostic marker. Results: Eight out of the 30 cases were signet ring cell (poorly cohesive) carcinomas that displayed a specific aspect: multiple intramucosal foci with loss of E-cadherin and mena protein. In one of them, although invasion was limited to the mucosa, diffuse carcinomatosis of the lymph vessels with re-expression of E-cadherin but not mena was seen in all of the gastric layers, with accompaying lymph node and liver metastases. In other case, diagnosed as pT1b tubular adenocarcinoma, an incidental skip metastasis was identified during sentinel node mapping. The only independent negative prognostic factor was localization of the tumour in the gastroesophageal junction. Conclusion: An EGC with invasion limited to mucosa and with carcinomatosis of the lymph vessels in submucosa and muscularis propria, which is now classified as pT1a, should be included in pT2, despite the absence of the tumour nests in these layers. Further research should be performed by the gastrointestinal working groups for a proper evaluation of GCs with atypical behavior. Six cases were KIT/PDGFRA wild-type. In the other six cases, KIT mutations in exon 9 (P456S mut) was detected in one case, whereas exon 11 was affected in the other five patients (insertion -3 cases, deletion -one case, p.V559G mutation -one case). In one of the cases, diagnosed in a 64 year-old female, one KIT/PDGFRA wild type-GIST was diagnosed in the stomach and, incidentally, a synchronous GIST was identified in the proximal stomach, with insertion in exon 11 of KIT gene. Conclusion: In Romanian patients, GISTs seems to be predominantly driven by KIT mutations in exon 11. Careful macroscopical examination of the surgical specimens should be performed to identify the synchronous GISTs; the molecular profile of both synchronous tumours is mandatory to be examined for effective targeted therapy. Objective: NF-\u03baB is activated by carcinogens, tumour promoters, inflammatory cytokines. The activation of NF-\u03baB can suppress apoptosis, thus promoting chemoresistance and tumorigenesis. Several studies have demonstrated an antiapoptotic function for Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), but its role in esophageal tumorigenesis has not been reported. Method: We obtained archival, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded material from surgically resected at esophageal squamous cell carcinoma specimens (85) containing tumour and adjacent normal and abnormal epithelium tissues. Tumour tissue specimens obtained were histologically and immunohistochemical examined. The immunohistochemical expression of NF-\u03baB p65 was investigated relevant clinical parameters (tumour size, metastasis of lymph node, differentiations.) Results: Immunohistochemical analysis showed enhanced nuclear staining for NF-\u03baB/p65 in both high-grade (P < .0001) and low-grade (P < .003) cancer specimens, compared to benign tissue. High levels of nuclear immunohistochemical expression of NF-\u03baB p65 were detected in the esophagus cancers, with significantly higher levels in poor differentiated tumours compared with well differentiated tumours (P < .0001). In NF-\u03baB p65 expression level was significantly higher in poorly differentiated tumours than well differentiated (P < .0001). High levels of nuclear immunohistochemical expression of NF-\u03baB p65 were detected in the in tumours having large tumour size and a greater number of the lymph node metastasis. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that expression of NF-\u03baB/p65 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is related to tumour progression. Objective: Metastasis of malignant melanoma has been shown to different organs of the human body with a rare incidence involving gastrointestinal tract. Melanoma by itself is a great mimicker of other neoplastic conditions and may create a major diagnostic challenge. Method: This report involves, a 38 year old woman suffering from melanoma of the scalp that developed into gastrointestinal metastasis. Results: In March 2008, our patient was diagnosed with superficial spreading melanoma, amelanotic type (Clark V, Breslow 7 mm), of the scalp. After 10 months, in three lymph nodes of the neck, metastases were detected. In March 2010, after endoscopic biopsy of gastric mucosa, and microscopic examination of the sample, melanoma metastasis were observed, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis: Melan A +, HMB45 +, Pan CK -/+. Diagnosis is complemented by cytological findings, which showed the presence of melanoma cells. Following surgical removal of the stomach, part of the colon, and part of the small intestine, macroscopic mucosal tumour deposits were observed. Microscopic analysis confirmed the presence of metastatic melanoma, with transmural invasion. In regional lymph nodes metastatic deposits were detected. Conclusion: The behavior of head and neck melanoma is aggressive, and it has an overall poorer prognosis than that of other skin sites. Objective: Intraabdominal lymphangiomas are rare congenital malformations and most are located in mesentery. Although they are generally asymptomatic, they may be complicated by intestinal obstruction or cyst rupture occasionally. Method: Here, we present a case with cystic lymphangioma of small bowel mesentery. Results: A-6-year-old boy referred with nausea and vomiting. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed a cyst 88 \u00d7 35 mm in size without significant contrast enhancement and located in right lower abdominal quadrant. Laparotomy was performed and patient underwent a partial small bowel resection. In gross examination, two separated cysts which are 6.7 and 2.5 cm in diameter were detected. The cyts were attached to the mesentery and filled with a serous fluid. The thickness of the cyst wall was only 0.1 cm. Microscopically, cystic spaces were covered by a flattened one-layer epithelium which was stained positive for D2-40 and CD31 immunohistochemically. The cyst wall was composed of fibrovascular stroma and adipose tissue. Diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma was made based on immunohistochemical findings. Conclusion: Lymphangioma of small bowel mesentery constitutes less than 1 % of all lymphangiomas and shows variable expression of vascular markers, such as D2-40, CD31 and CD34. Mesenteric cysts, cystic mesothelioma, peritoneal inclusion cysts, parasitic cysts should be considered in differential diagnosis. Objective: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the most common complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract is among the three major target organ systems of GVHD together with skin and liver. Method: GI biopsies taken from a total of 133 patients with GI GVHD were graded using Snover's system for severity of mucosal pathology. The correlation of pathological grade with clinical parameters comprising age, gender, primary disease, stem cell source, biopsy time, clinical symptoms, and clinical grade was evaluated using Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Median age of 133 patients was 38 years ranging between 6 and 68 years. Majority of the patients were diagnosed as AML (34. 6 %) followed by ALL (21 %). GVHD was found in multiple sites in 56.5 % of the biopsies of which duodenum was the most severely affected site in 60 % of the cases. Pathological grade had no correlation with clinical parameters except for clinical grade (p < 0.05; kappa 0.111). Conclusion: Since GVHD involves multiple sites with varying degrees of severity in GI tract, both clinical and pathological grading seem to be necessary to have a better clinicopathological correlation for follow-up and treatment of the patients. Bcl-2 expression was more frequent in intestinal type carcinoma compared to diffuse, however this difference was not statistically significant. Bcl-2 and Flip-l expression both significantly correlated with tubular histology of GC (p < 0.01, respectively). Expression of Flip-l was significantly associated with the absence of lymphovascular invasion and low pathologic stage (p < 0.01). Nuclear expression of Survivin was also linked to low pathologic stage (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Our results suggested that antiapoptotic markers demonstrate trend of more frequent expression in GC with favorable clinicopathologic features. This inverse correlation between immunohistochemical expression of Survivin, Flip-l and Bcl-2 and tumour aggressiveness in GC requires further elucidation. Objective: The metastatic pathway is not always predictable, especially for renal cell carcinoma known as one of the \"greatest mimics encountered in clinical medicine\". We report a rare case of a 58-years old male who had nefrectomi 2 years ago, presenting now with unexpected metastatic disease. Method: The patient was admitted to the emergency room with acute abdominal pain followed by copremesis and gastrointestinal bleeding, therefore segmental resection of the small intestine was performed with primary entero-enteral L-L anastomosis. The gross examination revealed the presence of three polypoid structures measuring from 3 to 8 cm in diameter, causing retraction of the wall towards the intestinal lumen and segmental intussusception. On selected samples immunohistochemical analysis with RCC, CD 10, CKAE1/AE3, Vimentin and EMA were made. Results: The microscopic examination showed aggregates of cells with clear cytoplasm and round uniform nuclei, surrounded with distinct membrane, infiltrating intestinal wall and ulcerating the mucosa. Immunohistochemical staining for RCC, EMA and CD10 showed positive expresion, that confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Method: We have investigated several eIF subunits in NET-and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC)-samples by analyzing the cytoplasmic expression intensity (score 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+), and the density of cells featuring a positive expression (%) . As controls, we have analyzed eIFs in the corresponding normal tissues. We also correlated prognostic parameters, i.e. time-to-relapse and overall-survival, with eIF expression levels. Results: Our analysis shows a deregulation of eIFs in NETs and NECs, as compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, some eIF subunits are upregulated in tumour tissue, whilst others are down-regulated in tumours, compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: As conclusion, eIFs are activated aberrantly in NETs and NECs. Differential expression of eIFs in NETs is likely to influence NETand NEC-tumorigenesis. In future eIFs may be potentially useful as disease biomarkers, and might serve as therapeutic targets. Objective: We aimed to assess the prognostic significance of tumour budding in the intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach, determine its relationship with other clinicopathologic features. Method: Tumour budding was assessed in 52 archival cases of the intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections; tumour buds were defined as single cells or nonglandular clusters composed of <5 cells. The presence of budding was determined through assessment of all tumour-containing slides, and associations with clinicopathologic features and outcomes were analyzed. Two pathologists participated in an interobserver variability study. Results: Budding was present in 32 (71,5 %) of 52 cases and was associated with decreased overall survival (log rank = 30,57, p = 0.001). High-grade budding was linked to advanced pT classification (p < 0.01), lymphatic invasion (p < 0,01), blood vessel invasion (p < 0.01), perineural invasion (p < 0.01), histological grade (p < 0.01), nodal status (p < 0.01), tumour size (p < 0.01), and stage (p < 0.01). On multivariable analysis, tumour budding, and stage were prognostically significantly independent of grade, tumour size, nodal status, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion. Inter-observer agreement was considered strong (k = 0.77). Conclusion: The presence of tumour budding, and stage are significant predictors of poor outcomes in patients with the intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Objective: Dedifferentiation associated with loss of diagnostic markers with or without heterologous trans-differentiation is a rare phenomenon in GIST which mainly occur under or following tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) therapy. We herein present two cases of dedifferentiated GIST that occurred without prior TKI therapy. Method: Histopathologic and panel of Immunohistochemical markers were used including CD117, CD34, vimentin, DOG1, desmin, myogenin. Results: Patients were primarily A 17-year-old girl and a 32-year-old man who underwent distal gastric resection & gastrectomy for multinodular GIST (6 cm) and a huge GIST (25 cm) respectively. Patient 1 is an recent case and remained disease-free at 34 months. Case 1 showed a dominant epithelioid SDHB-deficient GIST (CD117+/CD34+) with a 1 cm focus of anaplastic pleomorphic sarcomatous \"MFH\"-like component (vimentinonly phenotype). Case 2 showed a DOG1+/CD34+/CD117-negative bland spindle cell component and juxtaposed rhabdomyosarcomatous component (DOG1-/CD34-/CD117-/desmin+/myogenin+) with focal intermingling. Conclusion: Although rare, dedifferentiation with or without heterologous trans-differentiation do occur rarely in Imatinib-naive GIST and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Thorough sampling of such cases is necessary for appropriate classification.",

Method: Duodenal and gastric endoscopic biopsies of 25 patients between 2003 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed for the two morphological criterias; increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and normal villus pattern (Modified Marsh Classification of histologic findings in celiac disease (Oberhuber) -Marsh groups 0, 1, 2). These 25 patients were categorized under two groups; group 1, 11 patients who had clinically diagnosed Celiac disease with incerased IELs and group 2, 14 patients which had increased IELs in duodenum without the clinical diagnosis of Celiac disease. These two groups were re-evaluated histomorphologically and compared statistically according to these parameters: Helicobacter pylori presence in gastric biopsies, the ratio (grade? degree?) of increase in IELs, the presence of active duodenitis, lymphoid follicles and parasitic enfestation in duodenal biopsy samples. Two groups were analyzed statistically using the SPSS ver16.0. Results: The increase in IELs was not statistically significant between two groups. When the cut-off point was defined as %40, the ratio (?) of increase in IELs were found statistically significant in the clinically diagnosed Celiac disease group (p = 0.042). Accompanying Helicobacter pylori gastritis was found statistically significant in group 2 (p = 0.045). The presence of active duodenitis was not statistically significant between two groups. Conclusion: The increase in IELs in duodenal biopsy samples without villus atrophy is associated with Celiac disease if the increase ratio is high. The presence of Helicobacter pylori gastritis may be an important factor for the increased IELs in duodenal endoscopic biopsies.",

Objective: Mixed gastric carcinoma showed features of both adenocarcinoma (AC) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is designated as 'composite tumour' and is not an uncommon entity. Cases in which gastric AC and NEC are not intermixed appearing in a same patient are extremely rare and designated as 'collision tumour'. Method: A case of gastric collision tumour is presented here. Results: 71 years old male admitted to the oncology department with a history of abdominal pain, weakness and weight loss. Endoscopy revealed mass lesion of the gastric corpus, biopsy was performed. Histology revealed collision tumour, due to non intermixed AC and NET growth pattern. Tumour cells were positive for CK AE1/AE3, Chromograinin A (NEC only), Synaptophysin (NEC only) and CDX-2. Next subtotal gastric resection was performed. Histology confirmed a collision tumour diagnosis with tumour (NEC component) spreading to subserosal tissue. One regional lymph node showed AC involvement and three nodes were involved by NEC. Thus, collision gastric carcinoma pT3pN2 was signed out. Conclusion: Gastric collision tumour is a rare entity with less than 20 cases reported to date. Clinical and pathological data on association of AC and NEC should be reported and reviewed.",

H&E (A, C, D) and Objective: Aim of this study was to investigate simultaneous occurrence of synchronous and metachronous tumours in studied GIST cases. Method: From the archives of Fundeni Clinical Institute were identified between January 2004 and July 2014, 140 cases of GIST. Data on age, gender, clinical, histopathological aspects, and follow up were collected. Results: 14 patients out of 140 GIST (10.7 %) had also another tumour, 5 females and 9 males with ages between 38 and 81 being considered for this study. GISTs occurred in the small intestine (9) and stomach (5) with size ranging from 0.6 to 12 cm, 3 of them being highly mitotic (>5/50HPFs). Out of 9 small intestinal GISTs, 3 also associated adenocarcinomas of the stomach, 1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, 1 rectal adenocarcinoma, 1 chistadenoma of the kidney, 1 papillary serous chistadenoma of the ovary, 1 neuroendocrine tumour of the small intestine and 1cavernous liver hemangioma. The remaining 5 GISTs of the stomach associated scuamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, cavernous liver hemangioma, breast carcinoma, gastric neuroendocrine tumour and hyperplastic polyp of the stomach. Conclusion: The prognosis of these patients is mostly influenced by the malignancy associated therefore the treatment algorithm should be directed on the more aggressive tumour. Results: Of 196, female:male ratio was 1.27. Median age was 48 \u00b1 15.28. Almost 55 % were located in stomach, followed by appendix (19.4 %), rectum (9.7 %), small bowel (7.6 %), bulbus (5.6 %) and 2.5 % in other parts of colon. Multiple tumours were seen in 20.4 %. Seventy-two percent were grade 1, followed by grade 2 (20.4 %) and grade 3 (4. 6 %) . Chromogranin positivity was more frequent in stomach (p < 0.01). Tumour size differed between 0.1 and 10 cm, while in 83 cases (42.3 %) it could not be determined due to very small size, dispersed nature of the tumour cells and inadequacy of sampling. In 6 (3 %) cases Ki-67 index could not be evaluated due to cauterization artifacts or loss of tumour in serial immunohistochemistry sections. Conclusion: One of the major limitations for grading in biopsies was small sample size which interferes with Ki67 staining and interpretation. Presence of different staging systems and frequent updates in grading schemes have potential to lead to discrepancy when evaluating recurrent cases and determining time-trends of the tumours. Objective: Aim of the study is the investigation of antral mucosa in autoimmune gastritis which in contrast to oxyntic is considered unaffected. Method: The material consists of H&E and Giemsa stained sections of 1149 consecutive gastric biopsies. Results: Histological evaluation revealed HP-gastritis in 228(19,84 %), autoimmune gastritis (AIG) in 64(5,57 %), non-specific gastritis in 384(33,42 %), alkaline/chemical gastritis (ALG/CG) in 88(7,66 %), no/ minimal changes and others in 385(33,51 %) cases. In AIG was 39 females and 25 males and the mean age was 61,68 (range: 29-81). The atrophy was severe in 48, moderate in 9, mild in 4 biopsies and 3 had no data. In 12 cases pyloric mucosa showed changes of alkaline gastritis. The incidence of ALG in AIG was significantly higher compared to ALG/CG in the whole gastritis setting (p < 0,0001). Conclusion: ALG is a rather common finding in AIG which can be ascribed to a higher pH in the antrum due to the low HCL secretion in association with age related sphincter dysfunction. Objective: We aim to assess mucin phenotypes in gastric hyperplastic polyps (GHPs). Method: 33 GHPs were recorded over a 7 years period. We reviewed their endoscopic and histological features. MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6 immunohistochemical expression patterns were studied. The GHP mucin phenotypes were divided into 4 subtypes: the gastric mucin phenotype (G-type) , the intestinal mucin phenotype (I-type), the gastrointestinal mucin phenotype (GI-type) and the unclassified mucin phenotype (U-type).",

            "text": "Results: Sex-ratio was 1.6. Mean age was 59.8 years. 80 % patients had a single polyp and 20 % multiple polyps. Size was small than 10 mm in 82 % of GHPs and comprised between 10 and 15 mm in 18 % of cases. Polyps were cardial in 24 % of cases, fundic in 30 % of cases, corporeal in 15 % of cases and antral in 30 % of cases. Focal intestinal metaplasia was present in all cases. The G-types was observed in 63.6 % of cases and the GI-type in 36.3 % of the GHPs. Neither I-type nor U-type were found. Conclusion: Whereas the expression of mucins and its significance are elucidated in gastric adenocarcinoma, the significance of the mucin phenotype for GHPs has not been well documented and their prognostic value is not yet well established. Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumours of the stomach. They usually display immunopositivity for CD117(KIT) and most of them contain KIT-or PDFGRA-activating mutations. A broad morphological appearance of a gastric GIST may suggest an SDH-deficient tumour or may reflect divergent response to targeted therapies. Method: A 67-year-old male presented with a gastric tumour, measuring 9,5 \u00d7 7 cm, protruding into the lumen. A partial gastrectomy was performed. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue was examined with histology and immunohistochemistry. Results: Microscopically, a stromal gastrointestinal tumour, characterized by epithelioid cells (with nuclear polymorphism) and spindle cells (with vesicular ovoid nuclei), was revealed. Mitotic figures: 8/50HPF. There also was osteochondromatous differentiation and 3 positive lymph nodes. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were CD117(+ with dotlike pattern in the epithelioid element and + focally in the spindle cell element), CD34(+), DOG-1(+ focally), Ki-67(10 %). The diagnosis was gastric GIST, prognostic group 6a. Conclusion: In gastric GIST with spindle cell and epithelioid morphology, mitotic count and tumour size are important prognostic parameters, which could suggest the optimal targeted therapy, although the prognosis may be quite unpredictable, simulating SDH-deficient GISTs. Objective: To report a rare gastric metastatic case with adrenocortical origin. Method: A 71-year-old male presented with symptoms suggesting gastric cancer that was confirmed at gastroscopy and was diagnosed as undifferentiated carcinoma at biopsy. The abdominal CT-scan also revealed a tumour located in the right adrenal gland. Total gastrectomy and right adrenalectomy were performed. Results: Macroscopic examination of the surgical specimens revealed a protruded tumour of the posterior wall of the gastric body covered by intact mucosa and a 13 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 6 cm-sized encapsulated tumour weighing 500 grams, in the adrenal gland. Histopathologic examination showed an adrenocortical carcinoma composed by oval-shaped cells with slight eosinophilic cytoplasm with focally hyaline globules, a high mitotic rate (>20 mitoses/50HPF) and large hemorrhagic and necrotic areas. In the adrenal gland, the tumour capsule was crossed and metastasis was seen in the submucosa of the stomach, without lymph node metastases. The final diagnosis was based on the tumour cells positivity for vimentin, inhibin, calretinin, and melan A. A synchronous DOG-1/c-KIT positive gastrointestinal stromal tumour (10 \u00d7 10 mm, no mitoses) was also incidentally identified in the stomach. Conclusion: The gastric bioptic specimens that display undifferentiated carcinomas should be carefully examined to exclude a possible metastatic tumour. Results: The mean age of the patients was 41 (range, 26-61). Only five patients were postmenopausal, and seven were undergoing evaluation for infertility. Microscopic examination disclosed endometrial glands with varying degrees of hyperplasia and cytological atypia within a myofibromatous stroma. Squamous metaplasia was present in 25(89 %), and foci of well-differentiated EEA coexisted in 5 (17.9 %) cases. In 4 (14,3 %) other patients moderatelydifferentiated EEA was present both in APAM and endometrial fragments. Nine patients were initially treated with hysterectomy and the remaining 19 with curettage, polypectomy, or hysteroscopic transcervical resection, followed by hormonal therapy in 10 cases. There was one recurrence documented, while in 3 (13.6 %) of these patients the APAMs persisted up to 2 years. All patients except the one with advanced stage EEA (FIGO stage IIIC) were well and alive 16-147 (mean, 71) months after primary treatment. Conclusion: Although the clinical behavior of APAM is benign in most cases, it can be associated with sterility and rarely with endometrial carcinoma. Therefore a meticulous pathological evaluation of specimen of APAM is necessary for the detection of the coexistence of EEA.",

            "text": "Objective: Sebaceous adenoma arising in a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary is rare, although sebaceous glands are almost always found in benign ovarian teratomas. Method: We report a case of a 44-year-old female with sebaceous adenoma occurring in an ovarian mature cystic teratoma. Results: The ovarian teratoma was grossly cystic, with apparent solid mass protruding into the cyst cavity. Microscopically, most of the tumour consisted of a typical dermoid cyst. However, in solid areas the tumour showed lobular or diffuse proliferation of sebaceous cells showing various degree of maturity. Recent report described association of ovarian sebaceous adenomas with Muir-Torre syndrome (a variant of Lynch syndrome). In our case, we ruled out this possibility by immunohistochemical examination with antibodies against mismatch repair proteins (MLH2, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6), which were positive. Conclusion: We present the seventh reported case of a sebaceous adenoma arising in mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. Acknowledgement: Method: A 47-year-old woman with bleeding out of the cycle of 3 months backward was admitted to hospital. Gynecological finding indicated voluminous tumour with involvement of both the cervical lips. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumour with its epicenter in the region of the posterior cervical lip with infiltration of the cervical stroma, without penetration of parametria. Tumour biopsy revealed cervical adenosarcoma. Subsequently, surgical intervention was made. Results: Macroscopic exam of the surgically resected uterus discovered polypoid formation 47 mm in its greatest dimension confined to the cervix. Microscopically, the tumour was composed of epithelial and stromal elements, which were arranged in leaf-like pattern. Glands were compressed in thin slit-like pattern with evidence of stromal condensation around the glands. Glandular epithelium showed benign histological characteristics with focal multiplied and pseudostratified nuclei without atypia. Stromal cells had moderate cytological atypia with mitoses up to 4/10 HPF. Focally, hemosiderophages and areas of fresh bleeding was found. Conclusion: Biphasic tumour with clear histological signs of benign epithelial and malignant mesenchymal component allows the diagnosis of cervical adenosarcoma. In differential diagnosis, primitive endometrial tumour propagation in the cervix and papillary fibroadenoma should be considered. Objective: To assess cyclic production of glycodelin (GD) in endometrium of patients with chronic endometritis (CE). Method: Morphological and immunohistochemical examination was performed of the uterine cavity scraping samples taken during midproliferative phase (days 8-11) from 51 patients of reproductive age with dysfunctional uterine bleeding and infertility (Group 1) and 22 control patients (pipelle before ECF) (Group 2). Results: Morphological features of CE were detected in 26 patients from Group 1. Signs of non-specific chronic inflammation were not found in endometrial samples from Group 2. Immunohistochemistry of samples without CE showed a lack of GD in the glands; it correlates with GD production pattern during normal ovulation cycles in fertile women. Eighty-three percent of patients with CE had GD expression in glandular epithelial cells implying premature GD production in mid-proliferative phase. Conclusion: Patients with morphologically verified CE have premature GD production in the peri-ovulation period. Synthesis of GD possessing contraceptive activity in this period may contribute to infertility in CE patients. Objective: Adenomatoid tumour is a relatively common benign tumour, which has an incidence of 5 %. Its most common location is genital tract and has a mesothelial origin. Adenomatoid uterine tumour (AUT) is found incidentally in routine hysterectomies. Method: A 55-year-old woman who had an hysterectomy because complex endometrial hyperplasia. Results: A whitish-yellowish, intramural, circumscribed and 1,5 cm diameter nodule was found. Microscopically, it showed an intramural and well defined nodule of cuboidal cells with pseudoglandular spaces delimiting an adenoid pattern and surrounded by variable-size myometrial smooth muscle fibers. Inmunohistochemistry, it was positive for cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and 7, WT1 and calretinin. Conclusion: AUT is an incidental and solitary finding. It measures less than 4 cm. It is positive for cytokeratin 7, calretinin and D2-40; negative for cytokeratin 5/6, 20, EMA, vimentin, desmin, MDM2, CDK-4 and CD31 and its mitotic activity ranges between 0,2 and 3 %. It has a characteristic histology, so inmunohistochemistry is not usually necessary; however, certain tumours mimic AUT (lipoleiomyoma, liposarcoma, lymphangioma, haemangioma and adenocarcinoma). AUT is a common tumour, but often we forget its existence and is underdiagnosed. It is required to consider AUT and its differential diagnosis to avoid making big mistakes.",

Method: Evalute microscopic slides from our archive and perform immunohistochemistry staining. Review literature. Results: What first appeared to be a tumour primary to the colon showed an immunohistochemical profile typical for an endometrial carcinoma. After reviewing literature we found that the metastasis was unlikely to represent endometrial carcinoma arising in endometriosis. Conclusion: Our case report underlines the importance of considering metastatic disease as a differential diagnosis even in unusual locations and the value of complementary analyses in identifying the origin of a tumour. Objective: Large cell variant of small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), is a rare tumour, usually occurring in young women. Method: We report a case of 36-year-old female presented with an ovarian tumour 8 cm in diameter. Results: Grossly, the ovary consisted of partly solid and partly cystic tumour. Microscopically, the tumour consisted of large cells with ample cytoplasm and irregular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. In some areas, the tumour cells were arranged in solid sheets, in others, there was pseudofollicular arrangement. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for vimentin, cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Moreover, the tumour cells shows loss of Brg1 expression. Other markers examined including S-100 protein, desmin, CD31, CD34, D2-40, alpha-inhibin, and BerEP4 were negative. Conclusion: We described a case of large cell variant of SCCOHT. This variant is rare, only few cases have been reported to date. Recently, it has been shown that SCCOHT is associated with SMARCA4 gene mutation. Mutation of this gene is associated with loss of Brg1 protein expression. As immunophenotype of SCCOHT is non-specific, loss of Brg1 can be used as a helpful marker in differential diagnosis of these tumours.

            "text": "Objective: Ovarian hemangiomas are rare tumours with less than 60 reported cases in the English literature. These lesions may rarely be associated with systemic manifestations. Conditions associated with ovarian hemangiomas include stromal luteinization, ascites, thrombocytopenia, endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. Method: We report three cases of ovarian hemangiomas: Ovarian tumour was detected in 69 year old female with known diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A 68 year old female presented with ascites. Preoperative checkup suggested pelvic malignancy. Adnexal mass was discovered incidentally in 81 year old female. Results: Histopathologic examination of every case showed ovarian hemangioma with concomitant stromal luteinization. Moreover, in one case a component of Leydig cells was present. Conclusion: Ovarian hemangiomas can be rarely associated with stromal luteinization, we report additional three cases. Objective: One of the most frequent causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding is endometrial polyps (2-23 %) and endometrial hyperplasia (14 %) . Most of the time, both lesions are easy to recognize on hysteroscopic and microscopic examination however they may pose diagnostic problems due to the overlap in morphology in both situations. The aim of this study was to distinguish endometrial polyps from endometrial hyperplasia based on the stromal positivity of p16, generally used for other purposes in gynecologic pathology. Method: We examined 44 cases, 24 endometrial polyps (15 atrophic, 8 functional, 1 hyperplastic) and 20 endometrial hyperplasia (9 simple, 1 simple with atypia, 10 complex with atypia). In all cases, stromal cell positivity for p16 (p16-DB Biotech, clone R19-D) was classified into 4 grades: grade 0 (0-10 %), grade 1 (\u226510 < 25%), grade 2(\u226525 < 50%), and grade 3(\u226550%). Results: Stromal p16 positivity was 70.8% in polyps and 0% in hyperplasia, respectively (highly statistically significant, p = 0.0001). Most of the 24 polyps (65%) had grade 3 stromal positivity. There was no difference in glandular p16 expression between endometrial polyps and hyperplasia. Conclusion: The significant difference in p16 stromal positivity justifies this markers's usefulness in the differential diagnosis between these two lesions with different treatment (polypectomy vs. hormonal/ hysterectomy in hyperplasia). Method: We report case of the patient 42 years old which appears because of metrorrhagia lasting past 4 years. Results: Intrauterine tumour mass size 5 \u00d7 2,5 \u00d7 2,5 cm was detected and surgically removed. The tumour grossly resemble polypoid mass. Stromal component is arranged in solid structures. Epitheloid tumour component (represented about 60% of the tumour mass) is arranged in adenoid, tubular and follicular structures, as well as, cribriform and solid groups, bands and nests. Mitoses, with pathological forms were numerous, more than 9/10 high power field. The infiltrative tumour ingrowth in the myometrium was detected. Immunohistochemical tests show tumour mass immunoreactivity for vimentin, calretinin, CD56, AE1/AE3, focally for desmin, CK7, melan A, HMB45 with coexpression of PR and CD99. Ki-67 was positive up to 10% of cells. Tumour was diagnosed as uterine tumour resembling ovarian sex cord tumour.",

            "text": "Objective: Yolk sac tumour of uterus is a very rare tumour that that usually arises in the testis or ovary, it's depelop in the uterus is a result of aberrant migration of primordial germ cells. It is important to be aware of such entities to ensure correct diagnosis and hence patient management. Method: We present a case of 57 years old woman in climax presenting with postmenopausal bleeding and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein. CT scan showed an enlarged uterus measuring 9.2 cm in length. Biopsy report suggested non-keratinized epidermoid carcinoma microcellular with areas of clear cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated G3, with areas of infarction and acute inflammation associated. The mass was excised and sent to our pathology department for histopathological examination. We reported Yolk sac tumour of uterus with hepatoid pattern T2aN0M0. The section from the uterin cervix and ovary did not show any remarkable pathology. Results: We discuss the clinicopathological features of the case and review the literature for previously reported yolk sac tumours. Objective: Endometrioid carcinoma simultaneously involving the uterus and ovaries are problematic when establishing whether they are synchronous malignancies or a single primary and associated metastasis. We present a case of such challenging diagnosis in a young woman. Method: A 38 year-old woman with personal history of Hodgkin lymphoma, presently in remission for 10 years and fibrocystic breast disease was admitted to our hospital for uterine and bilateral ovarian masses and metrorrhagias. After surgical intervention, on histopathological examination we found endometrioid carcinoma with squamous differentiation in the uterus, cervix and ovaries. In order to establish tumour origin, histopathological features were analyzed and immunohistochemistry for vimentin, ER, PR, CDX2 was performed. Results: High positivity for vimentin, ER, PR for both ovaries and endometrium, and weak positivity for CDX2, together with morphopathological characteristics concluded endometrioid endometrial carcinoma with squamous differentiation, FIGO grade 1, with cervical extension and bilateral ovarian metastasis, pTNM stage IIIA. Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry is important in differentiating synchronous from metastatic tumours, especially in places with limited resources, as for providing accurate diagnosis and staging so the patient can benefit of optimal therapeutic management. Objective: Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the endometrium that describe endometrial glands and stroma. By the localization of ecoptic endometrium, endometriosis can be classed as internal endometriosis and external endometriosis. Internal endometriosis-adenomyosis is the presence of endometrium in the uterine muscle. In external endometriosis the ecoptic endometrium is positioned outside the body of the uterus: ovarium, peritoneum tube, ileum, cervix, vagina. Method: External endometriosis is the form of smaller or larger fields of fresh or old bleeding or hyperemic nodal changes bluish to dark brown in color. The 33 years old female was hospitalized after showing the symptoms of suboclusion. During preoperative diagnosis and preparation, resection of terminal ileum was performed with the presence of a submucous lesion along the muscular layer, up to 10 mm long. A transverse section showed that it is of \"spongy structure\", cystic in appearance, color brownishred. Segments were fixed in the 10% formaldehide, paraffine and cut by the microtome to 5 \u03bcm sections and colored HE method. The muscle wall of the small bowel revealed numerous gland foci and endometrial stroma. Surrounding the glands were a large number of macrophages filled with haemosiderin. Immunohistological analyses were carried: CD10, ER. Results: External endometriosis is a rare localisation. Diagnostics is based on the patohistological analysis. The microscopic picture of endometriosis shows the presence of endometrial glands and stroma surrounded by inflammatory infiltrate. Conclusion: The patohistological diagnostics of external bowel endometriosis is the key to identifying this change. The recessed part of the bowel is analyzed on the tissue cultures colored by a standard HE method and immunohistochemical analyses. Objective: The ovary is a common site of metastases. Clinical and histological features of metastatic tumours frequently mimic primary ovarian malignancies causing serious diagnostic problems for the surgical pathologist. Frozen section is widely used in the intraoperative assessment of patients with ovarian tumours but it can be very difficult to distinguish certain types of primary ovarian tumours and metastases from other sites. Method: We examined 152 cases of secondary ovarian neoplasm diagnosed in The National Institute of Oncology, Hungary from 2000 to 2014. Results: Colorectal cancer was the most common primary tumour (58 cases), followed by breast (33 cases), endometrium (30 cases) and stomach (13 cases) cancer. The differential diagnosis the most difficult was when endometrioid and mucinous tumours were presented in the ovaries. Metastases of colorectal and gastric adenocarcinomas may simulate benign or borderline cystadenomas too. In 74 cases frozen section was performed but metastatic origin of the tumour was successfully identified only in 32 cases (43%). Conclusion: The knowledge of the patient's history and immunhistochemical stains were helpful for distinguishing these secondary ovarian tumours from primary ovarian neoplasms. Frozen section is only moderately successful in distinguishing primary ovarian malignancies from tumours metastatic to the ovaries.",

            "text": "Objective: To identify the features of myomas of different size in women of reproductive age. Method: We analyzed 30 cases of large size myomas in women of reproductive age, who were in barren marriage. In all cases patients underwent hysteroresectoscopy and endoscopic conservative myomectomy. Morphological study was conducted on the basis of the pathology laboratory at the National centre of obstetrics and gynecology of the RK. Results: In 11 cases we observed single myomas, while in 19 women we found multiple myomas. Myomas were predominantly located on the back wall. We found out that large myomas (61 to 70 mm) were prevalent. In 20 cases we noticed a deformation of the uterine cavity due to submucosal and intramural myomas. During the histological examination in large myomas we observed degenerative changes including edema, mucilaginization, cyst formation, focuses of necrosis, calcification with reactive focuses of inflammation. We also noticed focuses of adenomyosis. Conclusion: The prevalance of large size myomas in women of reproductive age is a sign of hyperestrogenia. We believe that infertility in this groups could be explained not only by deformation of uterine cavity, but also by necrosis, calcification, focuses of inflammation in large myomas. The latter indicates 'fast growth', caused by ademomyosis. Morphological findings allows us to assume that there are certain differences of growth patterns in large myomas and myomas of medium and small size. Objective: To analyze cases of endometriosis in women older than 40. We noticed that endometriosis in these category is a major morphological finding after histological analysis of surgical material. Method: We analyzed 38 cases of endometriosis in women (40 to 67 year old), who experienced radical surgery, including hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy because of leiomyomas of the uterus. In accordance with the classification of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine we diagnosed Stage II endometriosis (12 cases) and Stage III (26 cases). The research was undertaken based on the materials of pathology laboratory of the National centre of obstetrics and gynecology we analyzed all cases of endometriosis diagnosed in 2014 (within the frameworks of the research project on clinical and laboratory diagnostics of endometriosis). Results: After hystological study of 38 cases of endometriosis, in 21 case we diagnosed endometrial hyperplasia (complex hyperplasia with atypia). In all cases we diagnosed focuses of mild proliferation of fallopian tube epithelium. In four cases we observed cellular leiomyomas. Conclusion: Results of our research show the connection between Stage II and Stage III endometriosis and proliferation of endometrium and of fallopian tube epithelium. Moreover, endometriosis influences rate of proliferation of leiomyomas. Objective: Since 2001, the theory of pelvic serous carcinogenesis, the origin of serous carcinomas from STIC (serous tubal intraepithielial carcinoma) has been proposed and nowadays it is widely accepted. The aim of this study is to find out the incidence of tubal lesions in pelvic serous carcinomas in our institution. Method: One hundred forty four pelvic serous carcinomas (ovarian, tubal, peritoneal) had been operated at our institution from 2005 to 2014. The fallobian tubes of patients were examined by SEE-FIM (sectioning and extensively examining the fimbriated end) protocol. All tubal hematoxylin-eosin sections with anomalies (nuclear crowding, hyperchromasi) were further evaluated with immunohistochemical p53 and Ki67 staining. Method: Normal myometrium (n = 15) and myometrial samples of the women with POP (n = 30) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Verhoeff-van Gieson stain (VVG), collagen I, III, V, fibronectin, fibulin-5, matrix metalloproteinase 1, 9, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1, 2 (TIMP-1, 2). Results: In MSC of the women with POP we observed perivascular VVG-positive black deposits, that were also positive for collagen III, a decrease average expression of collagen I (4,6 \u00b1 4 vs 54,8 \u00b1 3 %, p < 0,01); collagen V (14 \u00b1 2 vs 65 \u00b1 9,3 %, p = 0,02), fibronectin (10,9 \u00b1v8 vs 14,7 \u00b1 4 %, p = 0,03) and fibulin-5 (0,6 \u00b1 0,2 % vs 11, 7 \u00b1 1,2 %, p < 0,01). The ratio of collagen I and III type was 1:6,3 vs 1,8:1 (in normal myometrium). TIMP-1, 2 were negative. The same changes were found in myometrial veins. A strong negative correlation was detected between collagen V and fibronectin (r = \u22120,9, p < 0,05, in control r = \u22120,8, p = 0,3). Conclusion: POP is accompanied by the connective tissue remodeling of the uterine body. Objective: Aggressive angiomyxoma (AA) is a rare, locally agressive tumour of pelvis and perineal region with mesenchymal origin. This tumour tends to grow slowly with a low tendency to metastasize, but it shows a local agressive behavior and local recurrence. Method: A 25 year old Turkish woman revealed to clinic with vulvar mass. After physical and gynecological examination surgical resection was performed. Results: In light microscopic examination tumour was consisted of spindle and stellate shaped cell embedded in a loose-myxoid stroma. In immunohistochemical examination tumour cells expressed vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA) and estrogen (ER). Tumour cells were negative for CD34 and progeterone (PR). Based on the pathological findings tumour was diagnosed as AA of vulva. Conclusion: AA is believed to arise from specilized mesenchymal cells of perineal and pelvic region cells which are reactive to estrogen and/or progesterone. Because of this these tumours usually expresses ER and/or PR. Our case is also expressing ER. Method: Biopsies of the lower uterine segment were studied at the time of a cesarean delivery in women with MFS (n = 15) versus in ones without MFS, pathology of uterus and complications of childbirth (n = 10). All samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Van Gieson, collagen types I, III and V, fibronectin, fibulin-5, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1, -9), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP-1, -2), connexin-43. Electron microscopy (EM) and electron immunocytochemistry (EIC) using an antibody against connexin-43 were performed on six samples. Results: There was a decreased expression of collagen I (3,7 \u00b1 2,8 vs 67, 9 \u00b1 17 %, p < 0,01), collagen III (14,7 \u00b1 2,2 vs 32,3 \u00b1 14 %, p = 0,03), fibulin-5 (2,6 \u00b1 1,9 vs 15,4 \u00b1 0,7 %, p < 0,01) and TIMP-1,-2. The collagen type I/III ratio was 1:4 vs 2:1 in the reference group. EM and EIC showed a reduction of gap junctions between smooth muscle cells and a decreased connexin-43 expression in smooth muscle cells and telocytes. Objective: The term \"M\u00fcllerian adenosarcoma with sarcomatous overgrowth\" (MASO) is defined as the presence of pure sarcoma occupying at least 25 % of the tumour, usually high grade in nature and without a benign glandular component. In this report we present a MASO case with heterolog elements, derived from uterine cavity. Method: A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Vaginal examination revealed enlarged uterus and ultrasound scans revealed a large heterogeneous mass in the uterine cavity. Results: On gross examination a friable polypoid mass arrised from uterine corpus. On microscopic examination revealed a biphasic tumour in which glands were scattered throughout the stromal component. The later formed broad polipoid fronds that typicaly projected into the glands The stroma were more cellular around glands and formed characteristic periglandular cuffs. There were bizarre cells and rhabdomyoblasts that were varied from round to strap-shaped and eosinofilic cytoplasm with cross striations. Immunoreactivity with desmin and skeletel muscle markers (myogenin and myo D1) were identified in rhabdomyoblasts and small cells. Conclusion: Uterine adenosarcoma is relatively rare tumour and is hard to diagnose without immunohistochemistry. The most important adverse prognostic factors are deep myometrial invasion, sarcomatous overgrowth and heterologous elements, especialy rhabdomyosarcoma. Objective: Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasia of the female reproductive system, in most developed countries with an annual incidence of up to 25/100,000. In the present study, we evaluate immunohistochemically the expression of GAL-3 in endometrial carcinoma and its correlation with prognosis and patient survival. Review of the literature reveled that up-regulation of galactin-3 has been associated with adverse clinicopathologic factors in several types of malignancies and indeed it has been suggested that inhibition of galactin-3 may provide a novel therapeutic approach in some tumours. Method: GAL-3 expression was assessed by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry in 46 primary endometrial carcinomas. Results were statistically analyzed in relation to standard diagnostic clinicohistopathological parameters. Results: GAL-3 expression was detected in all patients with endometrial carcinoma (45.7 % with mild, 15.2 % medium and 39.1 % high expression) and exhibited statistically significant correlation with the histological type, disease stage, differentiation and myometrial invasion. The 5-year survival for mild and medium GAL-3 expression was 100 %. However for patients with high GAL-3 expression, the 1-year survival rate was 83.33 %, the 2-year was 44.44 % and the 5-year survival rate was 33.33 %. Conclusion: GAL-3 expression is associated with poor prognosis and could be used as an independent prognostic factor in patients with endometrial carcinoma. Nevertheless, there are relatively few investigations of GAL-3 in endometrial carcinoma, thus, its role in the carcinogenetic process and on effective therapies in those tumours awaits further elucidation. Objective: Identification of tumours with BRCA dysfunction has therapeutic and prognostic implications proven for breast and ovarian but still debatable for uterine carcinoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression of p53-and BRCA1-proteins, detected by immunohistochemistry, in high grade endometrial in comparison with high grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC). Method: The investigation was performed on 13 cases of endometrial carcinoma with serous and non-serous G3 morphology and 13 agematched cases of HGSOC using monoclonal anti-p53 and BRCA1 antibodies. Two of the uterine cases -one with serous and one case with mixed histology (serous and G3 endometrioid) had history for previous breast carcinoma. Results: All 13 HGSOC and 5 out 13 endometrial cancers showed p53 overexpression. Twelve of thirteen ovarian carcinomas revealed no expression of BRCA1 and therefore are suspicious for BRCA1-mutations. In the uterine group the same pattern was observed only in the two cases with previous breast carcinoma which were p53 positive. Conclusion: Combination of serous morphology, p53 overexpression and history for previous or synchronous breast cancer or HGSOC could be included as criteria for stratification of patients with endometrial carcinoma suspicious for BRCA1-mutations and suitable for genetic testing. Objective: To study the morphological and molecular substrate of impaired endometrial receptivity in fertile patients with external genital endometriosis who enter an assisted reproductive technology program.",

            "text": "Method: 140 infertile patients, including 50 women with grade 1-2 external genital endometriosis (a study group), 44 with endometrioid ovarian cysts (a comparison group), and 54 with tuboperitoneal factor of infertility (control group) were examined. All the patients underwent aspiration pipelle endometrial biopsy on 6-8 days following ovulation. Serial paraffin-embedded sections were used to determine the count of pinopodia and the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), HOXA10, glycodelin A, integrin av\u03b23, and aromatase in the superficial epithelium, glandular epithelium, and endometrial stroma. Results: The patients with external genital endometriosis had significantly lower pinopodium counts (p < 0.05), decreased expression of LIF, HOXA10, integrin av\u03b23, and glycodelin A in the superficial epithelium and a significantly increased expression of aromatase in the superficial epithelium, glands, and endometrial stroma cjmparing with control (p < 0.05). The highest expression of aromatase was seen in patients with endometrioid ovarian cysts. Objective: Endometrial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is a rare tumour with a few cases reported in the available literature. We present a case of endometrial transitional cell carcinoma in a 43 years old patient presented with profuse bleeding. After curettage and diagnosis of TCC was made, the patient underwent operation. Method: The operative material contained the uterus with both adnexa. The uterus (720 gr weight) contained an intracavitary, polypoid mass which infiltrated the whole myometrium, serosa and the left ovary. The tissue specimens were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Immunostainings with CK7, CK20, Vimentin, Estrogen receptor, Progesteron receptor and Thrombomodulin were made. Results: Microscopically, the tumour was composed of solid sheets and tightly packed papillary structures with thin fibrovascular cores lined by many layers of transitional cells showing moderate to severe atypia. The neoplastic cells were positive only for CK7 and Vimentin. The patient had FIGO stage III A. Pulmonary and liver metastases occurred after the chemotherapy and the patient passed away 11 months after diagnosis. Conclusion: TCC is a distinct type of endometrial carcinoma which has to be recognized. It broadens the spectrum of endometrial neoplasms. Objective: To describe five cases of unsuspected primary fallopian tube carcinomas discovered during the examination of hysterectomy with oophorectomy specimens due to gynecological malignancies and review the literature. Method: Patient's age ranged from 34 to 70 years. Four cases were preoperatively diagnosed as ovarian carcinomas and the fifth as an advanced-stage adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Two cases received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. One patient had BRAC1-2 mutation, not tested in the remaining cases. Results: All cases were high-grade serous adenocarcinomas, bilateral in one. Stage ranged from pTis to pT3cpN1pM1. The immunohistochemical profile was WT1+, p16+, ER+, RP+, PAX8+. p53 was positive not only in the infiltrating component but also in the contiguous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (TIC) identified in all cases. Tubal neoplasms were synchronous with other gynaecologic malignancies in three cases: one ovarian malignant m\u00fcllerian mixed tumour, one ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma and one advanced-stage endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Conclusion: Thorough examination of the fallopian tube in hysterectomy with oophorectomy specimens because of gynaecologic malignancies can reveal non-suspected primary tubal neoplasms. The identification of tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (TIC) and PAX8, p53 positivity supports its primary origin and the theory that at least a proportion of high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas are in fact tubal in origin. Physical examination showed a polypoid mass protruding from the external os resected with a presumptive diagnosis of \"endocervical polyp vs myoma\". After the pathological diagnosis she underwent hysterectomy with oophorectomy. Results: Histology revealed a biphasic neoplasm composed of mediumto-large glands lined by ciliated, tubal-type epithelia with high-grade dysplasia set in a sarcomatous, mitotically active background that consisted of spindle cells with low-to-moderately pleomorphic nuclei. Stromal cells were concentrated around glands displaying a \"phyllodeslike\" pattern. Stromal cells were vimentin+ and actin, desmin, CD10 and cytokeratins negative. Dysplastic epithelia was CK7+ and negative for CEA and p16. p53 immunoreactivity was found in both components. No residual tumour was found in the subsequent surgical specimen. Conclusion: Since the epithelial component of an adenosarcoma is, by definition, benign, cases with high-grade epithelial dysplasia are difficult to classify. Whether the presence of high-grade epithelial dysplasia affects or not their prognosis is still to determine. Once excluded extension of a primary uterine neoplasm, the differential diagnosis includes adenofibroma, atypical polypoid adenomyoma and mesonephric adenocarcinoma with malignant spindle-cell component. Objective: Vulvar angiomyofibroblastoma is rare solid neoplasm of benign course. This vulvar entity of 49-year old woman is reported here. Method: The surgically removed tumour underwent formalin fixation and was sampled for H&E and immunohistochemical evaluation. Results: The tumour grew at left vulvar labia and clinically mimicked Bartholin cyst. On cut surface the 3,5 cm-in-diameter tumour was whitish, flesh, solid with myxoid outlook. Hypocellular and hypercellular fields were mixed in the neoplasm. Microscopically the tumour was composed of proliferation of small thin walled vessels with adhering cuffs and islands of epithelioid, spindle and occasionally vacuolizated plasmacytoid cells. Tumour cells sprouted from perivascular regions and accumulated in nearby of vascular branches in pattern of pericytelike proliferation. Some aggregations of cells with vascular compression resembled a bit haemangiopericytoma pattern. Myxoid intercellular matrix constituted pas -alcjan blue-positive, hypocellular areas. The tumour co-expressed vimentin and desmin with no immunoreactivity for CKAE1/AE3 and SMA. Such an immunofentype is thought to share myofibrolastic origin despite SMA negativity. Conclusion: Thus, it could be speculated that our case of angiomyofibroblastoma is an example of tumour that probably derives from perivascular stem cells with further acquisition of some myoid features. Objective: In 2009, Montgomery and Epstein described \u0430 novel variant of capillary hemangioma with an unusual sinusoidal pattern reminiscent of splenic parenchyma and coined the term \"anastomosing hemangioma\". The lesion was considered unique for genitourinary system with predilection to kidney. In the literature we found only four cases of this entity in ovaries. Method: A 70-year-old woman presented with cystic formation of the right ovary, intraoperatively diagnosed as serous cystadenoma. The section of the ovary revealed a fortuitous finding in the cortex: circumscribed lesion, 7 mm in diameter, with mahogany brown, spongy appearance. Results: Microscopic examination of H&E-stained slides manifested well-demarcated but un-encapsulated vascular proliferation, composed of tightly packed capillary-sized blood vessels with an anastomosing sinusoidal-like architecture. Endothelial lining featured only mild cytologic atypia and lack of mitotic figures. Tortuous large caliber feeding and draining vessels were present and the lesion was surrounded by luteinized ovarian stroma. Immunohistochemical examination with CD34 and CD31 highlighted endothelial cells. Conclusion: The analysis of all five cases with ovarian anastomosing hemangioma pointed the following clinico-morphological features: accidental finding in menopausal age, small sized lesion often in combination with stromal luteinization and serous cystadenomas but the significance of this combination is still uncertain. Objective: AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) is a tumour suppressor gene involved in chromatin remodeling. This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the differences of tissue expressions of ARID1A in a spectrum of cervical neoplasms. Method: One hundred patients recently diagnosed as cervical intraepithelial neoplasms or invasive squamous cell carcinoma with or without adenomatous component at the Tepecik Training and Research Hospital were identified using pathology databases. Results: In this series, there were 29 low and 29 high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasms, 27 squamous cell carcinomas and 15 adenosquamous carcinomas. Statistically it was determined that the expression of ARID1Awas significantly down-regulated in adenosquamous carcinomas when compared with in non-invasive or invasive squamous cell carcinomas (p = 0.015). Conclusion: Our findings were demonstrated to link of ARID1A expression and the adenomatous differentiation of uterine squamous cell carcinomas. Therefore it may be suggested that ARID1A gene may act as a role of pathogenesis of cervical adenosquamous carcinomas. Objective: Gestational trophoblastic neoplasias (GTN) are rare tumours that constitute less than 1 % of all gynecological malignancies. Invasive mole is a distinct subgroup of GTN, which if not diagnosed and treated early, can result in serious complications like uterine perforation and haemoperitoneum. Method: We present two rare cases of an invasive mole of the uterus, which developed following the evacuation of a molar pregnancy. They were 43-year-old and 49 -year-old patient with vaginal bleeding after endometrial curettage and have a continuous high level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Results: We performed hysterectomy to the two patients who completed the parity. They were given a diagnoses of invasive mole of the uterus and successfully treated before any major complications could arise. Conclusion: After molar pregnancy curratege, 15-20 % patients can develop postmolar gestational trophoblastic diseases. The vaginal bleeding that continues after molar pregnancy curettage, high or not decrease value of hCG and the persistant theca lutein cysts are the most frequency findings. The patients must be researched for metastasis. Usually, chemotherapy should be given after curettage and sometimes hysterectomy can be done. Objective: Placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT) is a rare gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). The most important difference between PSTT and other GTD is slow growth and chemotherapy resistance of PSTT. Method: The aim of this report is to present a unique entity of GTD and challenges in differential diagnosis. Results: A 27 year-old woman revealed to clinic with menometrorrhagia. In sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging intramural mass resembling myoma uteri and right adnexial multiloculated cyst was obtained. In clinical history patient had a pregnancy 5 years before and baby was alive and healthy. Surgical excision was performed for intramural mass and adnexial cyst. In histopatholgoical evaluation mononuclear and multinuclear trophoblasts were infiltrating myometrium and uterine vessels. This finding was representing a trophoblastic neoplasia and beta-HCG serum levels was negative. With clinical and histopathological findings PSTT was diagnosed. After the histerectomy and bilateral salphingooopherectomy diagnose was confirmed and chemotherapy was given.",

            "text": "Conclusion: PSTTs are exceptional subtype of GTD tumours, encountering difficult clinical and histological diagnosis. Consequently, novel therapeutic strategies are still needed with better efficacy and less toxicity, in particular for those with drug-resistant disease. Centralized care of GTD should be made worldwide as this will likely save more young lives. Objective: To elucidate the clinical presentation, complications, microscopic features, and differential diagnoses of early stage (gestational age less than 20 weeks) PMD. Method: 10 cases of PMD were clinicopathologically analyzed. Immunohistochemical study of p57 (Kip2) (p57), which is products of a paternally imprinted, maternally expressed gene, was also done. Results: Maternal ages ranged from 23 to 40 years. Gestational periods ranged from 12 to 19 weeks. Five patients were initially diagnosed as partial mole (PM) and one was as complete mole (CM) with twin on ultrasound examination. One case was associated with BWS. Histologically, early stage PMD was characterized by moderate swelling of stem villi with cistern formation, myxoid change, dilated veins, mild stromal cell proliferations, and the absence of trophoblastic hyperplasia. Dilated subchorionic vascular vessels with or without luminal thrombosis, or chorangiosis, which were observed in the third trimester PMD, were not found. Cytotrophoblasts were positive for p57 in all cases, and villous stromal cells were diffusely positive in 3 cases, focally positive in 5, and uniformly negative in 2. Conclusion: Early stage PMD can be clinically or pathologically misdiagnosed as abortion, PM, or CM with a twin. Histologic features in early stage PMD are less distinctive compared with those of PMD in the third trimester. The diagnostic clues are moderate swelling of stem villi with cistern formation, myxoid change, dilated veins, and mild stromal cell proliferations and the absence of trophoblastic hyperplasia. The p57 immunohistochemical study is useful for differential diagnoses in equivocal cases. It is important to identify PMD cases prenatally to reduce fetal morbidity and mortality.",

Hastanesi, Dept. of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey Objective: Mesonephric adenocarcinoma (MA) is a are tumour of the female genital tract, mainly in the cervix and vagina. Here we report a case of cervical MA having morphological and immunohistochemical features of clear cell carcinoma in a 48-year-old woman. Method: In curettage specimen, there were large areas with pseudoendometrioid pattern and focal area with clear and hobnail cells. All areas were HNF 1-\u03b2, Amacr positive, Napsin A, ER/PR negative and p53 was wild type. Results: The curettage diagnosis was adenocarcinoma with features of clear cell carcinoma. In resection specimen there was mesonephric adenocarcinoma in the cervical wall with mesonephric hyperplasia at the periphery of the tumour. Conclusion: The presented case of cervical mesonephric adenocarcinoma revealed HNF 1-\u03b2, Amacr positive, ER/PR negative and wild type p53 immunostaining results, this may result diagnostic confusion particularly on a small biopsy specimen. Objective: Preeclampsia renders significant influence on condition of mother, fetus and newborn, being the most dangerous and frequently occurring complication of pregnancy. Method: The condition of erythrocytes of 85 pregnant women was researched with help of raster electron microscopy with elemental analysis and atomic power microscopy. Results: The content of discocytes decreased till 56 \u00b1 1,6 % (85 \u00b1 1,6 % in control group). Pathological forms of cells have appeared. The content of normocytes were in limits of 68 % from general number of discocytes. 20 % of them were microcytes and 12 % were macrocytes. The depth of cavity of discocyte was 0,38 \u00b1 0,05 (0,24 \u00b1 0,04), the ratio of erythrocyte's diameter to size of cavity was 38,6 units(25,5). Their diameter was 7,43 \u00b1 0,5 (6,75 \u00b1 0,3 \u03bcm) in average. Cells of extended form were revealed, what may testify about breach of elasticity of membranes as well as about difficulties of passage through microcirculatory vessels due to alteration of its structure. The content of cytoplasmic bridges between cells was increased, what led to stasis, sludging and thrombosis. The concentration of oxygen in erythrocytes decreased on 18 %. Conclusion: Revealed alteration pose a threat to condition of mother and fetus due to development of hypoxia and ischemia of tissues. Virchows Arch (2015) 467 (Suppl 1):S1-S279 S143",

Objective: The primitive neuroectodermal tumours of the ovary are rare tumours, which belong to the monodermal teratoma group. These tumours manifest in three forms: differentiated (ependymoma), primitive (neuroblastom, PNET, ependymoblastoma), anaplastic (glioblastome multiforme). The PNET often exhibits aggressive clinical behavior. There have been a small number of case reports of PNET arising in the ovary. They are most frequently large, localized unilaterally, solid but maybe partially cystic. We present a case of pelvic PNET arising in the right adnex.",

Method: A 61-year old woman underwent routine abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to abdominal mass and vaginal bleeding. Macroscopic and histological examining revealed an enlarged uterus with numerous fibroids except one that contained \"nodes within node\". There were also enlarged ovaries, endometrial polyp of usual type, and hyperplastic endometrium. \"Nodes within node\" consists of solid cords and clusters of hypercellular tissue that is reminiscent of proliferating endometrial stroma and sex-cord-stromal-like areas. Foci are surrounded by bundles of smooth muscle cells which do not differ from those in other fibroids of the same uterus. There was lympho-vascular invasion. Results: Foci showed immunohistochemical positivity for vimentin, S-100, CD99, calretinin, \u03b1 inhibin, CK7, CKMNF116, EMA, CD10, WT1, MelanA, CD117 and Cyclin D1 while negative for SMA and desmin. Conclusion: It seems that in the occurrence of tumours such as this, stem cells have a crucial role as thay have the potential of differentiation in various directions when they are appropriately stimulated. Bilateral stromal hyperplasia of the ovaries with persistent ovarian hormone secretion should be considered as a possible factor of influence on the stem cells differentiation. Objective: Dermoid cysts (mature cystic teratomas) usually develop in the ovary. However, extragonadal dermoid cysts are extremely rare with less than 35 cases reported so far, most of them developed in the omentum, usually coexisting with same lesion in the ovary. The etiology of these this tumour is not well known'. Method: A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for abdominal pain and abnormal uterine bleeding for 2 months. Physical examination revealed a palpable umbilical mass. Ultrasound and CT scans showed a 6 cm submucosal leiomyoma and a calcified cystic mass, located posterior to the anterior abdominal wall.

Conclusion: While the left ovary was present at anatomical site and normal, the patient's right ovary was absent at normal site during laparotomy and possible auto-amputation of the ovarian tissue with consequently development of the tumour might be suggested in this case. Objective: The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of liquid basic cytology, HPV-test and P16/Ki67 dual stain immunocytochemistry in screening and diagnosis of cervical precancer pathology for women younger and older 30 years. Method: Matelial from 30 women younger 30 years and 124 women older 30 years were examined using histology, liquid basic Cytology, immunocytochemistry and HPV-test (RT-PCR).

Macroscopic examination revealed a bulcky polypoid intraluminal and full-thickness myometrial infiltration mass. Results: Histopathologic examination showed a malignant tumour composed of two distinct components: A superficial grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma and a more invasive (transmural) and aggressive component composed of small to intermediated sized hyperchromatic cells forming solid sheets, extensive necrosis, high mitotic rate and angiovascular invasion. Strong and consistent expression of three neuroendocrine immunohistochemical markers (synaprophysin, CD56, NSE) confirmed diagnosis of a small cell carcinoma. Conclusion: SCCE is extremely rare with limited reported cases to date. Although it's characteristic morphology may be misdiagnosed as undifferentiated carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma etc in the absence of immunohistochemical analysis. A correct diagnosis is leaded by using of morphological examination, immunohistochemistry, detailed clinical information and radiology findings. Objective: Benign uterine leiomyomas are the most common pelvic tumour in women. Uterine smooth muscle tumours are classified according to their morphologic features that include architecture, growth pattern, cellular characteristics, number of mitoses and constituents of the intercellular stroma. The aim of this paper is to present different types of uterine leiomyoma diagnosed in our institution. Method: In this retrospective study, 1510 gynecological specimens collected over a period of 1 year were studied. A detailed macroscopic and microscopic examination of all tumours of myometrium were made after fixation and staining of samples with routine HE and immunohistochemical techniques. Results: Benign neoplastic lesions of the myometrium were diagnosed in 556 (36.8 %) of the total 1510 specimens. All benign tumours were leiomyomas, except 12 cases that were adenomyomas. Leiomyoma was the most common tumour of the myometrium accounting for 97.8 %. Usual leiomyoma constituted for 94.42 % and variants of leiomyomas were 5.58 %. We have established the presence of the following variants leiomyomas: appoplectic, cellular, epitheliod, hydropic, lipoleiomyoma, mitoticall active, myxoid, neurilemmoma-like, symplastic, leiomyoma with erythropoiesis. Conclusion: Variants of leiomyomas and their partial presence were relatively rare, but it is important to differentiate them from malignant tumours of the myometrium.

Method: To a 20-years old patient performed right ovariectomy with a large tumour alteration of diameter 16 cm of white-yellow color, of homogeneous appearance. Several tissue fragments have been biopsed from the Douglas cavum, omentum and peritoneum. Results: Histologically tumour tissue is built of atypical cells that look like transitional epithelium, oesinophilic cytoplasm, hyperchromatic oval nuclei with clear nucleolus and longitudinal nuclear grooves like those in granulosa cell tumour. Malignant cells build islands, stripes, adenoid and pseudoglandular formations surrounded by a massive stroma of fibroblastic appearance. Smaller centers of necrosis and areas corresponding a benign Brenner tumour. Tumour ovarian tissue with implants from Douglas cavum, omentum, and perioneum shows imunophenotype: CK7+, CK20-, inhibin-, calretinin-, CD99-, WT1 citoplasmatic +. Based on the morphological characteristics and imunophenotype the following diagnosis has been set: Malignant Brenner with stromal invasion and peritoneal implants pTb(FIGO IIIB). Conclusion: Malignant Brenner is a rare ovarian surface epithelial neoplasms, composed of transitional (urothelial)-type epithelial cells. Makes 1-2 % of all ovarian tumours. It usually appears in the sixth decade of life, unulateral (90-95 %), and it's extremely rare in young women. Histological appearance can be like carcinoma of transitional epithelium or planocellular, granulosa cell tumour and non-differentiated carcinoma. It's necessary to implement immunohistochemical methods. Therapy is syrgical and adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Epithelial cell abnormalities were detected in 7.390 (6.55 %) of the total number of analyzed tests. Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) were found in 69.37 %, high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) were in 10.93 % of the patients, and cervical cancer was suspected in 0.18 % of the cases. The youngest age group (24-35 years) has highest percentage of SIL (9.76 %), but 79.82 % of them were LSIL, and only 8.15 % were HSIL. The middle age group (36-48 years), has abnormal Pap tests in 5.06 %. HSIL is more often detected in this age group (17.18 %). The oldest age group (49-60 years) has the least detected abnormalities (1.90 %), but the highest rate of invasive cervical cancer (2.53 %). Conclusion: In the older target groups, abnormal tests are less often detected, but if present, they more often belong to the category of HSIL, or even invasive cervical cancer. Detailed and careful analysis of the pap smears is essential to prevent false negative results, especially in older patients where serious epithelial lesions can mimic benign atrophic changes. Objective: To correlate cell proliferation index and hormonal expression with pathological stage in type 1 endometrial carcinoma. Method: We designed an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. The sample included 107 patients with primary type 1 endometrial cancer. In each tissue sample, immunohistochemical markers of Ki-67, estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors were performed. Endometrial carcinoma was staged according to the FIGO. Clinical information was retrieved from the medical records. Results: A total of 107 patients with primary type 1 endometrial carcinoma were included in the analysis. The mean age of presentation was 56 years. In respect to grade of differentiation, 2.8 % were classified as well differentiated, 76.6 % as moderately differentiated, and 20 % as poorly differentiated. The proliferative index by Ki-67 was positively correlated to the clinical stage and histological grade. Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positivity had a negative correlation to the clinical stage and histologic grade. Objective: To present a case of an ovarian sclerosing stromal tumour and a literature review of the topic. Method: We identified a case from our University Hospital \"Dr. Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez\" in northeast Mexico. Results: A 19-year old patient, without any relevant history, presented to the gynecology clinic because of abdominal pain. The pain had started 5 days earlier and was colic. A pelvic ultrasound revealed a left adnexal mass. The result of tumour marker CA-125 was reported 98.3 U/mL (normal range: <35 U /mL). The lesion was surgically excised. The macroscopic evaluation showed a 10 \u00d7 10 cm tumour with an intact capsule. At section, the tumour was solid with some areas showing cystic degeneration, white and yellow alternating regions with fibrosis. Microscopic examination revealed a lobular growth pattern with alternating areas of hypocellularity and hypercellularity composed of spindle-shaped cells producing collagen and round to oval cells with lipid-rich cytoplasm; additionally interlobular fibrosis was observed.

Conclusion: In conclusion considering histological characteristics and immunophenotype of differentially considered tumours (Fig.2) we have concluded that findings point to metastatic tumour of urothelial origin and that the biopsy of enlarged kidney should be performed, suggesting clinicopathological correlation should be done. Objective: To determine the frequency of negative cervical excision findings following a diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Method: A total of 452 patients who underwent cervical excision after a diagnosis of HSIL between 2004 and 2014 were enrolled. Data regarding patient age, prior cytological and histological diagnosis, HPV status (Cervista\u00ae HPV high-risk test), and size of specimen were obtained from medical and pathological records. Results: The overall incidence of negative excisions at our institution was 14 %. The lowest incidence was among women with concordant preceding cytology and biopsy diagnoses (11 %, 29 out of 265 cases). The highest incidence was among women with HSIL biopsy/LSIL cytology (20 %, 6 out of 30 cases) and women with LSIL biopsy/HSIL cytology (20 %, 30 out of 146 cases). No statistically significant differences were found between positive excision group and negative excision group regarding age (mean 36 vs 34 years, respectively, p = 0.25), size of specimen (mean 27 vs 26 mm, respectively, p = 0.87), and hr-HPV negative status (33 vs 38.5 %, respectively). Conclusion: Multiple factors may contribute to negative excision. We did not detect a difference in frequency regarding age, size of specimen or hr-HPV status between positive and negative cervical excision findings. Results: The uterus cut surface showed multiple masses in myometrim ranging from 0,5 to 5,5 cm, poorly definited. The nodules appearead yellow to tan and had a softer consistency. The uterine cavity was free. Ovaries were multi-cystic. Microscopic examination showed a densely cellular tumour composed of uniform, oval to spindle-shaped cells of endometrial stromal-type. Atypia, pleomorphism and mitosis were minimal. Areas of sex cord-like differentiation were seen.The tumour involved the well of the uterus without exceeding. Both ovaries showed follicular cysts. Conclusion: ESS is a rare malignant tumour, presenting as abnormal uterine bleeding in perimenopausal women. The usual preoperative diagnosis is uterine leiomyoma and definitive diagnosis is achieved only after histopathology of uterus. An early diagnosis is essential because patient survival is directly related to tumour stage.",

Method: To present a case of benign inclusions in lymph nodes which could be related to an inflammatory process or a tumour. Our aim was to alert pathologists towards a group of lesions which can imitate metastatic carcinoma, and especially towards those inclusions which present together with malignant neoplasias of the female genital tract. Results: Invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix, pT1b1N0Mx, was found in association with benign glandular inclusions in a pelvic lymph nodes. Epithelium of the endocervix looked regular morphologicaly. Diagnostic features of benign inclusions like bland nuclear cytology, absence of mitosis, necrosis and desmoplastic stromal reactions helped with the in achieving a correct diagnosis. Benign iclusions were found in one pelvic lymph node from the right side and in one pelvic lymph node from the left side. Conclusion: Benign inclusions can be found in lymph nodes of individuals with or without a malignant disease. Their appearance is similar to the epithelium of the uterine tube and, as such, they may imitate carcinoma metastasis. Therefore, it is very important to create awareness of this rare entity among pathologists to prevent misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis of malignant disease, especially on frozen sections.",

The histopathological subtypes were: serous (10 cases), endometrioid (7 cases), clear cells (1 case), mucinous (2 cases), and mixed (1 case); 4 cases were assessed as G1, 6 cases as G2, and 11 cases as G3. The tissue fragments were immunohistochemically processed using anti-E-cadherin and anti-CLDN3 antibodies. The histochemistry is useful in assessing the risk of recurrence of mucinous cystadenoma. The immunohistochemistry using the couple CK7/CK20 helps to determine the primary or secondary character of mucinous adenocarcinoma. Objective: To present common lesions in uterus and very rare in bladder with therapeutic implications. In one hand, bladder endometriosis and endocervicosis which are uncommon pathologic findings, with a common embryological origin and in the other hand secondary tumours of the urinary bladder, all of them less than 2 % of all urinary bladder neoplasm. Method: We reviewed all transurethral resections and cystectomies in our Hospitals in the last 10 years looking for M\u00fcllerian lesions or metastatic neoplasm from uterus. Results: We found endometriosis (5), endocervicosis (1), endometrioid adenocarcinoma (3) and squamous carcinoma from cervix (1). Conclusion: Is important to recognize these benign lesions of endometriosis and endocervicosis to not make a wrong diagnostic of metastatic carcinomas and recognize metastatic endometrioid carcinoma and squamous carcinoma of the uterus and make the differential diagnosis with primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder and urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation, for their therapeutic implications. Objective: We report a case of primary fallopian tube serous adenocarcinoma in 69-year-old woman. Method: The patient was at routine gynecological examination revealed a tumour mass in the region of the right ovary. Was hospitalized and underwent exploratory laparotomy. Taken a few fragments of tumour tissue for analysis. Results: At histopathologic analysis delivered two clips tissues. The first clip was soft, yellowish gray, partly papillary surface. The second clip was part of the fallopian tube with ovarian tissue. At the intersection of the lumen of the fallopian tubes filled with yellowish-gray tumour tissue. Ovary was grayish in color, made of mostly softer finely-nodular tissue. Histological examination of the clips presented tumour composed of complex papillae with stratified epithelium producing irregular slit-like spaces and small epithelial tufts. The cells were large, eosinophilic cytoplasm with high grade nuclei with abundant mitotic figures. Some nuclei were vesicular and nucleoli and sam nuclei were hyperchromatic. Immunohistochemical tumour cells were positive for EMA, CK7, WT1, p53, p16ink, and negative for Calretinin, indicating that the tumour, serous adenocarcinoma, origin of the fallopian tubes. Conclusion: Although rare, one should always think of the possibility that the serous adenocarcinoma origin of the fallopian tubes. Objective: When squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix invades the uterus this usually occurs in a direct way, however it rarely spreads superficially to the inner surface of the genital tract.

Conclusion: VEGF-C -VEGF-R3 co-expression supports the capacity of dissemination by lymphatic pathways, by its pro-lymphangiogenic potential, and therefore indicates a high potential of tumour aggressivity. Objective: This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the importance of tissue expressions of caveolin-1 and ARID-1A which are known as signal regulator and tumour suppressor in differential diagnosis of uterine smooth muscle tumours. Method: Thirty patients were included in this study and immunohistochemical stains for caveolin-1 and ARID-1A were performed. Results: In this series, there were 10 leiomyosarcomas (LMSs), 10 uterine smooth muscle tumours of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) and 10 leiomyomas (LMs). Cytoplasmic Caveolin-1 expression was determined In 9 LMSs and 2 STUMPs; while perivascular expression was determined in 5 LMSs and 2 STUMPs. Statistically it was determined if the tumour becomes malignant and more invasive, it gains the perivascular Caveolin-1 expression (p = 0.029). On the other hand, the mean nuclear staining rate for ARID1A in LMSs (63 \u00b1 23.4 %) was higher than both STUMPs (60 \u00b1 18.5 %) and LMs (%34.5 \u00b1 %16.5).

The increased number of melanocytes and limited extension of atypical cells in the epithelial thickness made the diagnosis difficult. The synchronous presence of the vulvar melanoma advances the suspicion of a multifocal pigmented lesion in the genital tract, likewise primary acquired melanosis with atypia of the conjunctiva, from which one evolved into nodular melanoma. Objective: Case report of PEComa of Lymph nodi associated with endometrial cancer of the uterus. PEComa are a collection of generally rare tumours, defined by the World Health Organization as \"mesenchymal tumours composed of hystologically and immunohistochemically distinctive perivascular epitheloid cells\". These are rare tumours that can occur in any part of the human body. It is especiall rareness for them to be found associated with endometrial cancer of the uterus. Method: Biopsy and operational material that is processed and analyzed in the laboratory. Results: Patient in menopause at the age of 60 is received on the department because of operational treatment uterine cancer. After classical hysterctomy with adnextomy, the material is during the pathohystological processing colored with methodes HE (Hematoxylin eosin) and IHH (Immunohistochemical color). After the procedure, the \"ADENOCAR- Results: Initial patohistological diagnosis after curettment was serous carcinoma of endometrium. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy, as well as tissue of the peritoneum and omentum were removed. In both cases macroscopic and histological analyses showed tumour infiltration of uterus body, starting massively from serosa to the surface of endometrium. Tumour was present in the surrounding adipose tissue and parts of the removed thickened omentum. Fallopian tubes and ovaries were intact. Tumour was composed of complex papillary and solid areas with large cells and pleomorfic nuclei. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining for beta-catenen, E-cadherin, vimentin, VEGF and p53 while calretinin was negative. Mitoses were numerous (10-14/10 hpf). Previously performed MR and CT scan excluded the presence of a primary tumour on another locations or organs. Tumour, in the both cases, was diagnosed as high grade primary peritoneal serous carcinoma. Conclusion: As a rare neoplasam, we wanted to present two cases with unusual initial symptoms that led to PPSC diagnose. Objective: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries and effects predominantly postmenopausal women. Definitive treatment for this dissease is total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy. Method: We report a case of 24 year old nulliparous woman with grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma and desire for in vitro fertilization. Results: Initially, patohistology of curettmen showed voluminous tumour tissue of endometrium with no microsatellite instability. Strong desire to maintain fertility in spite of potential oncologic risks led to conservative treatment with progestational agent megestrol acetate (Megace) with 320 mg/day for 3 months. After that diagnostic hysteroscopy with biopsy showed slight regression of carcinoma but still tumour was present. Next there months, again patient admitted same therapy but last 3 weeks she had combination of 320 and 480 mg/day of same drug. On hysteroscopy biopsy specimen tumour regression was evident and only small part of carcinoma was present. Next 3 month same protocol of Megace was admitted in high dosages of 320 and 480 mg/day. On follow up complete regression of carcinoma has been established. Patient is now in in vitro fertilization protocol. Conclusion: In young women with endometrial carcinoma fertilitysparing procedures and hormonal therapy are recommended in order to preserve reproductive potential. Objective: Disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM) is a paucicellular mucinous ascites most commonly associated with appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and rarely originating in primary ovarian tumours. Method: A 47-year-old female was admitted at the gynecology department for progressive abdominal distension and pain. Clinical, ultrasound and CT scan examinations revealed a large multiloculated cystic mass occupying the pelvis, with high suspicion of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). At surgery the peritoneal cavity was filled with seven liters of abundant gelatinous material. Many small mucinous nodules were seen on the peritoneal surface. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectectomy, appendicectomy and peritoneal lavage were performed. Results: Macroscopic examination showed a 26 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 9 cm multiloculated cystic left ovarian tumour with intact capsule and smooth walls, with mucinous content. One of the cysts had a greasy material with hair. Light microscopic examination revealed a mature cystic teratoma and mucinous cystadenoma with CK7+/CK20+ immunohistochemical profile of epithelial cells. The appendix had acellular mucin on the serosal surface, but the entire mucosa was unremarkable. Pools of mucin entrapped in adipose tissue without neoplastic epithelial cells were seen in the omentum, peritoneal nodules and parametrium, confirming the disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis. Conclusion: We report a rare case of DPAM produced by an ovarian mucinous cystadenoma developed on a mature cystic teratoma.

Method: We present two cases of a 17-year-old and 21-year-old women, who presented with a 6 month history of menometrorrhagia with irregular menstrual cycles and dysmenorrhea. Preoperative ultrasonography revealed an heterogeneous and echogenic right latero-uterine mass measuring respectively 69 and 65 mm, well vascularised in Doppler. A right kystectomy was performed and the peritoneal wash cytology was positive to malignancy in the first case and negative in the second one. The two patients underwent right unilateral adnexectomy with omentectomy, and appendectomy.",

The immunostaining for CD99 and calretinin was positive. Method: Case report: A 38-years-old woman with a past history of acute lymphatic leukemia, with a diagnosis of endocervical adenocarcinoma, usual type, stage Ib1 (FIGO) as well as an adnexal mass, underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen and detailed immunohistochemical analysis (p16, pCEA, ER, Vimentin) revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix (G2), an intramucosal well differentiated (G1) endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma, with focal mucinous and tubaric differentiation of the uterine corpus, mucinous adenocarcinoma of the left ovary. Thirteen months after appropriate treatment the patient is free of disease. Current criteria to discriminate between primary endometrial and endocervical adenocarcinomas (especially in cases with peculiar morphology) are also discussed. Conclusion: The diagnosis of multiple primary tumours is often a postoperative incidental finding. Multiple synchronous gynecologic cancers have a better prognosis (usually being low-grade/low stage tumours) than metastatic or advanced primitive disease. Determining whether these tumours are multiple primaries or metastases is helpful to predict their malignancy and to select proper treatment.",

ICLCs were usually small, with little cytoplasm and long thin prolongations, had exiguous amount of polyribosomes and granular endoplasmic reticulum, located perinuclear or in the dilated portions. In normal placenta ICLCs were localized in terminal and intermediate villous stroma, below the trophoblastic basement membrane, surrounding of the outline of capillaries by their processes. The cells created a three-dimensional network by connecting to each other and other cell types. ICLCs located in large blood vessel walls of stem villi could regulate of vascular tone. In case of UGR ICLCs were with vacuolated cytoplasm, deformed nuclei, they contained lipid drops. ICLCs probably have a high plasticity, acquired similarity with fibroblasts, myofibroblasts.

The term \"aggressive\" denotes the locally infiltrative and recurrent nature of this neoplasm. Method: A 48-year-old woman presented with a mass in the left labia majora, which had gradually increased in size. Clinical examination revealed a sausage-like, non tender mass, measuring approximately 20 cm in greatest diameter and having a soft consistency with normal overlying skin. The tumour was considered to be a bartholin gland cyst and was totally excised. Results: Microscopic examination revealed a neoplasm composed of spindled or stellate cells in a myxoid stroma with scattered vessels of varying caliber. Neither nuclear pleomorphism nor mitoses were observed. The neoplastic cells were stained intensely for cytoplasmic vimentin, desmin and few were estrogen and progesterone positive. The ki67 was <2 %. The diagnosis was aggressive angiomyxoma of the vulva. Conclusion: AA must be distinguished from benign proliferations with a low risk of recurrence as well as from fully malignant myxoid neoplasms. The optimal treatment is wide local excision with tumour free margins. Long-term follow-up and careful monitoring with magnetic resonance imaging are necessary in order to avoid local recurrence. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess CXCR4 expression and explore its contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC). Method: We examined CXCR4 expression in 124 primary colorectal tumours, 35 liver metastases tissues and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues by RT-PCR. Furthermore, the protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between CXCR4 expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed by X2 test, Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to investigate the prognostic value of CXCR4. Results: The relative mRNA expression of CXCR4 was significantly higher in (CRC) tissues as compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.001). The high expression of CXCR4 in cancer cells was significantly correlated with tumour grade (P = 0.0001), clinical stage (P < 0.05), and lymphatic invasion (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients with CXCR4 nuclear-type expression showed more frequent lymph node metastasis (p = 0.021), advanced clinical stage (p = 0.001) and lymphatic invasion (p = 0.03) than those with cytoplasm staining-type. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that high expression of CXCR4 was associated with poor prognosis (P < 0.001). Conclusion: CXCR4 plays an important role in the progression of colorectal cancer. The present data suggest that high expression of CXCR4 enhance the liver metastases causing poor prognosis. This protein may potentially be used as an independent biomarker for the prognostic evaluation of colon cancer in the Tunisian cohort. Objective: Cten, which is a member of tensin family, is located at focal adhesions and involved in cell motility. It acts as an oncogene. Even the information about Cten mechanism is still limited. We had hypothesized and shown that Kras is capable of regulating Cten and that this is possibly a means of mediating Kras function. However, Kras signaling is activated by many receptor tyrosine kinases and it is possible that the pathways may be different in breast and colon cancer. Method: In order to test a hypothesis that Cten is regulated by the EGFR-Kras-Braf axis in CRC, we sought to investigate the effect of EGFR on Cten in CRC cell lines. The C32 cells were stimulated with recombinant EGF or DMSO control. Stimulation using EGF resulted in upregulated Kras as well Cten when compared to DMSO. Results: For the functional effect. C32 cells transfected with anti-Cten siRNA (C32cten-) had reduced cell motility following EGF stimulation compared to cells transfected with scrambled control (C32ssc). Other controls showed that, as expected, EGF did stimulate cell motility (C32ssc/EGF vs C32ssc/DMSO) and knockdown of Cten did cause a reduction in cell motility (C32ssc /DMSO vs C32Cten-/DMSO).",

Objective: Androgen receptor (AR) plays an essential role in prostate cancer (CaP) progression. A castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is developed as a consequence of androgen deprivation therapy. Epigenetic regulation through DNA methylations and histone acetylation can affect androgen receptor signaling pathways. In some cases, in the CRPC a decrease expression of the AR gene due to DNA methylation silencing were shown. Our objective was to elucidate effects of DNA methyltransferase (5-Aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, Aza-dC) and histone deacetylase (Sodium butyrate, NaB) inhibitors on expression of methylated AR gene in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells representing a CRPC model. Method: Normal and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines were treated with Aza-dC, NaB and their combinations. The AR gene expression was determined at the cDNA level and using chromatin immunoprecipitation with following qPCR. Results: In treated cells, restored AR gene expression was detected, which was accompanied with increased histone H4 acetylation upon co-treatment with the inhibitors. Conclusion: Synergic/additive effect of the HDAC and DNA methylation inhibitors in cell model imitating the CRPC condition may contribute to influence the CRPC therapeutic strategy. Objective: Colonic mucins expression such as MUC1 and MUC5AC is altered in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate these two mucins involvement in 135 cases of colorectal carcinoma.

Thereby, MUC1 and MUC5AC expressions are related inversely to tumour differentiation. RT-PCR amplification of MUC1 gene is correlated with both immunohistochemical profile (p = 0.000) and colonic localization (p = 0.004). Note that as for MUC5AC, the molecular results show no significance when compared with clinicopathologic features and immunohistochemical profile. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the lack of Muc5AC staining versus positive mRNA expression in advanced colorectal carcinomas may be due to proteomic alteration such as hypermethylation. Conversely, we conclude that MUC1 expression is significantly associated with colorectal progression and may provide useful prognostic information for Tunisian patients with colorectal cancer. Objective: Chemokines along with their receptors are heavily involved in many carcinogenesis processes such as colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to elucidate whether C-C chemokine receptor 5 gene (CCR5\u039432) polymorphism is related to CRC risk. Method: CCR5 gene mutational status is analyzed, through a panel of 108 sporadic primitive CRC cases and 248 peripheral blood cases from healthy control subjects, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The receptor expression is evaluated using immunohistochemistry performed on normal mucosa and tumours. Results: The wild allele \"wt\" frequency in controls was 0.93 versus 0.97 in CRC cases, whereas rare allele \"\u039432\" frequency in controls was more recurrent at 0.07 as against 0.03 in colorectal carcinoma. No association was observed between CCR5\u039432 variant and CRC clinicopathologiccriteria. Conversly, CCR5 wild type showed a significant risk of 4.13-fold (95 % CI = 1.42-11.09) to cause CRC compared to individuals carrying the mutated gene \u039432. Statistical analysis of CCR5\u039432 immunohistochemical profile and the different prognostic parameters showed no correlation. However, the wild allele expression displayed a significant association with tumour differentiation degree (p \u2264 0.001) and non-mucinous carcinomas (p \u2264 0.001). Conclusion: We suggest that CCR5\u039432 may be a protective factor against CRC development. Objective: TP63 is a p53-related gene, is an important regulator of epithelial development, that contains two alternative promoters, which give rise to transcripts that encode proteins with (TAp63) or without (\u0394Np63) an amino-transactivating domain. Method: We examined the expression pattern of p63 in tumour tissues of CRC by immunohistochemistry, and by RT-PCR using isoform-specific primers to determine the variant distribution.",

This effect can be counteracted by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1). Therefore, this study was conducted to determine to what extent the enzymatic activities of TDP1 and TOP1 are increased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and if the activities correlate in tumour and non-tumour tissue. Method: Two biosensors previously used for measuring enzymatic activity in extract from cell lines were validated for use in cryosections and subsequently used for measurement of TDP1 and TOP1 activities in cryosections from paired tumour and non-tumour NSCLC tissue. Results: Both TDP1 and TOP1 activities were upregulated in the tumour compared to the non-tumour tissue (20/20 and 14/17 patients, respectively). Furthermore, a correlation was observed between TDP1 activity and tumour percentage and between TDP1 and TOP1 activity in both types of tissue. An even stronger correlation was observed when comparing the changes in TOPI and TDP1 activities (change = activity in the tumour tissue / activity in the non-tumour tissue Objective: Due to the phenotypic and molecular diversity of gastric cancer (GC), it is a challenge to determine a patient's prognosis.

A mutation specific pyrosequencing assay confirmed this result, suggesting the presence of a tumour subclone harboring the mutation.

NRAS (Q61L, Q61K, Q61R) mutations occurred in 4 of 6 mixed melanomas but were not detected in epithelioid, pure spindle cell or desmoplastic tumours. No instances of intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity were observed. Conclusion: Melanomas with BRAF mutations usually present with epithelioid cell morphology, while NRAS mutations are characteristic for the tumours of mixed histology. In contrast to other common cutaneous melanoma subtypes, desmoplastic tumours do not carry BRAF and NRAS mutations. These findings suggest relationships between morphological and molecular portraits of melanoma. Conclusion: Melan-A does not distinguish between nodal nevi and metastatic melanoma, although it helps to find melanocytes. We confirm the usefulness of p16 as an immunohistochemical marker of nodal nevi. We demonstrate for the first time that the nuclear expression of DEK and cytoplasmic expression of p62 allows the differential diagnosis between melanoma and nevus in a lymph node. We propose a diagnostic algorithm using these immunohistochemical markers. Objective: Granular cell tumour (GCT) is a relatively rare neoplasm, possibly originate from Schwann cells. Herein we presented a case of 36 year-old woman with metachronous granular cell tumours in the breast skin and the scalp. We aimed to define the clinical and histopathological features of GCT and discuss the differential diagnosis of benign form from malignant GCT. Method: Excisional biopsies from the breast skin and scalp were examined histopathologically and immunohistochemically; clinical findings were investigated. Results: The first lesion was located in the breast-skin which was excised. It was reported as granular cell tumour. Eighteen months later, the second lesion appeared in scalp. Second lesion had similar histological and immunohistochemical features like former lesion. Histologically no malignant criterion was defined in both tumours. Finally both of the tumours were accepted as benign GCT. Conclusion: GCT is an uncommon neoplasm which may occur on many different parts of the body. Most of the GCTS are benign but clinically and radiologically they may mimic malignancy. Histopathological diagnosis is important to establish the true nature of the lesion. GCT is characteristically solitary but may be multifocal, simultaneously involving the skin, submucosa and viscera. GCT is usually benign; however local recurrence is common due to incomplete removal. Objective: The aim of our work is to study the pathological aspects and histological prognosis of melanoma through a retrospective study about melanic tumours. Method: Our study focused on 207 samples collected at the department of Pathology Constantine. CHU extending over a period of 5 years from January 2008 to December 2012.The macroscopic resection specimens should be thin sections of 4 micron thickness are performed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunostaining with anti PS100 and anti Melan A is always performed. Results: During the 05 years we have collected only 19 malignant tumours (9.18 %), while our country is very sunny with predominant type 3 and 4 phototype skin. The rest is mild in nature, dominated mainly by skin nevus. A male predominance is noted, the sex ratio was therefore 1M / 0, 72W. The age of our patients varies between 06 and 85 years with a mean age of 61.62 in women and 55.2 in men. In our series, the nodular form (10.78 %) is the most common, followed by SSM and acro-lentiginale form (10.52 %) with a Breslow index of> 4 mm and Clark level varies between IV and V on more than half of our patients. Conclusion: The incidence of melanoma is increasing in fair-skinned populations which must impose a prevention against prolonged sunlight. Moreover, it has great potential metastatic hence the interest to seek the mutation in the BRAF gene, which is an indication of supervision in the metastatic progression of the disease. We report a case of a 27-year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome under treatment, who developed fever and a large skin ulcer at his intergluteal fold.

We report two melanoma cases arising in small dermal congenital nevus, a 77-year-old man with scalp nodule and a 67-year-old woman with preauricular nodule. Both patients observed change in size within the last 6 months. There were no other suspicious pigmented lesions or history of melanoma.",

Morphological examination revealed aspects of neuroendocrine carcinoma, nodular/trabecullar aggregations of small-to-medium monomorphous cells with scanty cytoplasm, \"salt-and-pepper\" nuclei and frequent mitoses. Immunohistochemical profile demonstrated paranuclear dot-like pattern of positivity for CK20, focal CK7 positivity for one case; TTF-1 and CD99 were negative; no other cases of MCC (with head and neck and forearm location) were positive for CK7. Differential diagnosis includes metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (mainly MCC or pulmonary small-cell carcinoma), melanoma or Ewing sarcoma. Conclusion: Primary MCCs involving the lower limbs are rare. CK7 positivity may be a peculiar finding of these turmours. Objective: Eccrine sweat gland carcinoma is a rare malignancy with a high metastatic potential seen more commonly in elderly patients. Solid organ metastases, lymph nodes metastases, and local recurrence are observed in 10-20 % of cases. Method: We report a case of recurrent and metastaticum eccrine sweat gland carcinoma 9 months after confirmed histologic tumour clearance by narrow-margin excision without regional lymphadenectomy. Results: Our patient was a 65-year-old female with nodular skin lesion at the posterior side of neck, 35 mm in size. In July 2014, a wide surgical excision was performed, and after histopathological examination, tumour was diagnosed as Spiradenocylindroma eccrinum cutis cum carcinoma ductale eccrinum invasivum cutis. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive reactions for CK7, EMA and CEA and negativity for TTF1. Lymph nodes were not enlarged. On physical examination distant metastasis were excluded. In March 2015, three local recurrences were observed, largest of which was 20 mm with central ulceration. Recurrence was confirmed on microscopic examination. Multislice computed tomography of thorax showed multiple metastases in the lungs. Conclusion: Eccrine sweat gland carcinoma may occur de novo or developing from a pre-existing lesion, as a solitary lesion with non characteristic macroscopic appearance. The presentation of this case shows an extremely aggressive behavior carcinoma of adnexal origin. Objective: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is autoimmune disease that leads to destruction of epithelium cells of oral mucosa. Despite the antigen is unknown, activation of T-lymphocytes occurs. The conventional corticosteroid therapy is the first choice of treatment but it is often associated with side effects and new therapeutic strategies are in focus of the investigators. The low level laser therapy (LLLT) is new therapeutic ability for OLP patients. The aim of the study was to detect and compare the expression of the proliferative (p63) and tumour-suppressor (p53) markers in OLP patient's biopsy before and after LLLT. Method: The biopsies from ten OLP patients (7 women and 3 men) were immunohistochemically analyzed for expression of examined markers. The biotin streptavidin peroxidase method was used. The expression of markers was measured using semiquantitative scale Results: The results of the study showed that in the keratinocytes the p63 expression was nuclear diffuse and not changed whereas the levels of p53 protein decreased after LLLT. The interactions between these two proteins are important for proliferation and differentiation of the stratified epithelium.",

Demodecosis itself is characterized with an infestation by mites provoking varying degrees of local inflammation and immune response with no evidence of rosacea. Method: We report 12 cases of rosacea and demodecosis being clinically and histologically misdiagnosed. Clinically these lesions were presented as an erythematous patch, papule or diffuse hyperemia of the face. The diagnosis was predominantly a basal cell carcinoma. Among other entities there were pigmented nevus, papilloma, mycosis, sarcoidosis and a single case diagnosed as a sarcoidosis or hygroma of the face. All of these lesions were surgically excised.

The second patient showed a cystic keratosical lesion (6 mm) with an abraded area on its surface. An epidermal cyst was suspected. The third patient presented a hemispherical papule (3 mm), suspecting an intradermal nevus. Under the microscope, the lesions correspond to cystic lesions. They show protrusions from cysts' wall, with differentiation towards infundibulum, isthmus, bulb and follicular papillae. The diagnosis was \"cystic\" panfolliculoma. Conclusion: Panfolliculoma is a rare lesion presented as a nodule or mass, clinically similar to a basal cell carcinoma, tricoephitelioma and epidermal cyst. Differential histopahology diagnosis must include: cystic trichoblastoma, tricofolliculoma and acanthoma of the hair follicle sheath. Objective: Keratoacanthomas with perineural invasion usually occur on the central face, involving the nose and the peri-oral area. They do not seem to behave in an aggressive manner but complete excision and very close follow up is indicated. Method: We report a case of a 58 year old female presented 3 years ago with a nodule on the nose of 4 months duration. The patient suffers from aplastic anemia. Results: A fairly large symmetrical squamoproliferative lesion connected to the epidermis and neighboring hair follicles is observed. It is associated with inflammation that tends to be prominent in some areas. Tumour lobules are glassy and keratinocytes are fairly bland which indicates a lesion that is quite mature. Mitotic activity is not high.A striking feature however, is the presence of a deeper component that is associated with prominent perineural invasion and this extends close to the cartilage.We believe that this represents a keratoacanthoma with extensive perineural invasion. No recurrence has been identified so far. Conclusion: Keratoacanthomas with perineural invasion are distinctive lesions that should be differentiated from squamous cell carcinoma. Their recognition is of great importance in order to avoid overtreatment of the patient.

Results: Dendritic cells are most frequent in the regressed areas, comparing with non-regressed ones and peritumoral inflammatory infiltrate. In regressed areas, dendritic cells have a predominant nodular pattern (19 cases), followed by diffuse isolate pattern (8) Objective: Cutaneous ciliated cyst is an exceedingly rare benign lesion, that is lined by a simple cuboidal to columnar ciliated epithelium.It seen typically on lower extremity in females in the second or third decade of life.They have been widely regarded as M\u00fcllerian heterotopias because of the morphological similarity of the cyst lining cells to the epithelium of fallopian tubes. Results: We reported a case of an 19-year-old female presented with painless swelling, over gluteal region since 1 years. On examination soft swelling was noted. Surgical removal of the cyst was carried out under local anesthesia. Grossly, specimen was 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0,5 cm in size and an multiloculated cyst was identified.Light microscopy revealed a cyst in the deep dermis, which was predominantly lined by single layer of ciliated cuboidal to columnar cells without mucous cells. In some areas the epithelium showed stratification and squamous metaplasia. The cyst wall was thin, fibrocollagenous without any inflammatory infiltrate. On immunohistochemical staining, the lining epithelial cells showed strong membrane positivity for pancytokeratin and strong nuclear positivity for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). Conclusion: Surgical removal under local anesthesia is the recommended treatment for cutaneous ciliated cyst.The recurrence has not been reported in the literature.

WT-1 microvessel density (MVD) was significantly higher in stage IIA CC with recurrences compared to non-recurring tumours and it was a significant negative, though not independent, predictor of shorter disease-free interval. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that WT-1 MVD may be useful to discriminate high risk patients with stage IIA CC who may benefit from adjuvant treatment. In addition, WT-1 expression in the tumour vessels may represent a target for novel therapies aimed at reducing tumour blood supply in stage IIA CC. Objective: The local stromal compartments surrounding carcinoma play essential roles in tumour development. Fibroblasts are one of the important stromal cells in the progression of many carcinomas. In this study we investigated the role of normal colonic fibroblasts (NCFs) in the tumourigenicity of colonic adenocarcinoma cells (CACs). Method: We used three-dimensional (3D) co-culture spheroids of the CACs and NCFs. The 3D co-culture spheroids were formed using an artificial matrix-free forced aggregation technique by a rotary orbital shaker. The spheroids were characterized by transmission electron microscope. Assays of CAC invasion using matrigel and tumorigenicity in nude mice to examine the effect of NCFs on CACs invasive behavior and tumorigenicity were performed using the 3D spheroids.",

The 3D co-culture spheroids seeded on the extracellular matrix using matrigel increased the invasion of CACs compared to CACs alone or together with NCFs in suspension. Injection of the 3D spheroids statistically generated more frequently and progressively growing tumours in nude mice compared to the CACs alone or together with NCFs in suspension. Conclusion: We demonstrated our novel 3D co-culture spheroids with an in vivo like condition. Our findings provide evidence of that the interaction between CACs and NCFs were essential to lead the cancer cells to tumorigenesis and tumour propagation.

We next examined the presence or absence of statistically significant correlations among MCP1A2518G and MMP9 mRNA expression. High expression of MMP9 was significantly higher in patients with at least one mutated G allele of MCP-1 gene. However no significant association was found between MCP-1 gene variant and the pattern of MMP-2 expression. Conclusion: Our data indicate that MCP-1 polymorphism was correlated with the overexpression of MMP-9 which are associated with increased risk of CRC in Tunisian population. Objective: Differentiation grade of colorectal adenocarcinoma is important for therapy selection. Poor differentiation (PD) is a contraindication for local therapy and, in stage II colon cancer, an indication for adjuvant chemotherapy. We analyzed the interlaboratory variability in histological grading of colorectal adenocarcinomas in daily practice. Method: Using the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), all synoptically reported adenocarcinomas resected between 2010 and 2013 were identified. The percentage of adenocarcinomas with PD was determined, and clinico-pathological factors associated with PD were investigated. We compared percentages of PD in a subgroup of 22 laboratories that had \u2265 50 synoptically reported adenocarcinomas. Univariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: We included 16,419 adenocarcinomas (15,986 patients) of which 11.1 % showed PD. Female gender, advanced age, right-sided localisation, tumour size, and T-stage were associated with PD. The percentage of PD adenocarcinomas varied from 7.0 to 18.5 % between 22 laboratories. Three laboratories graded significantly less and three laboratories significantly more PD than a reference laboratory. Over the years, laboratories that were aberrant varied. No laboratory was aberrant throughout the whole study period. Conclusion: We observed considerable interlaboratory variation in grading, but this was not consistent throughout the study period. Multivariable analyses are needed to further investigate the variation in grading.",

We herein report two cases of elastofibromatous polyps of the sigmoid colon and rectum, that presented to our department in a period of 15 years. Method: Case 1: A 30-year-old male patient with a 13 mm pediculated polyp of the sigmoid colon. Case 2: A 47-year-old female patient with a 3 mm rectal polyp. Results: Microscopic examination showed, in both cases, an unremarkable colorectal mucosa and a dense eosinophilic amorphous deposit involving the muscularis mucosae and the submucosa, associated, in Case 2, with thick-walled submucosal blood vessels. This eosinophilic material stained negatively with Congo Red and positively with elastic stain (Verhoeff). The diagnoses of fibroelastosis and angioelastosis were retained in Case 1 and Case 2 respectively. Conclusion: Elastofibromatous changes of the gastrointestinal tract are rare benign lesions. Depending on the histological pattern, they are classified as fibroelastosis, angioelastosis or elastofibroma. Although the pathogenesis remains unclear, they are considered to represent degenerative changes. On H&E stain, these lesions may be mistaken for amyloidosis.

Method: A total of 50 endoscopic and surgical specimens of colorectal neoplasms \u221226 adenomas and 24 carcinomas -were studied. The results from the immunohistochemistry procedure were categorized based on their percentage \u22120, 1-25, 26-50 %, 51-75 and 76-100 % -and intensity \u22120, 1+, 2+ and 3+, and then summarized as a score from 0 to 7.

We report a case of a 75-years old male presenting with constipation, vomiting and abdominal, i.e. acute abdomen, due to large bowel obstruction. He underwent urgent surgical operation. Method: The received material was a total colectomy with egsophytic tumour in the sigmoid colon, measuring 4 cm in length, with proximal dilatation of 16 cm in diameter. Standard tissue samples were embedded in paraffin blocks and Hematoxylin-Eosin and imunohistochemical stainings were made. Results: Histological analysis showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma Stage IVA. We found abundant desmoplastic stroma, partly hyalinised, with deposition of osteoid and focal formation of welldefined osseous islands of various shapes and sizes, with evident osteoblasts arranged as osteoplasts, with focally formed Haversian canals. Immunohistochemical staining showed CK18(+), Vimentin(-) signal for tumour cells, and Vimentin(+) signal for the osteoid, Osteopontin(+) signal for osteoblasts and osteoid. Conclusion: Pathogenesis is unclear, but there are theories describing fibroblast metaplasia into osteoblasts or production of BMP-2 and FGF-2 by tumour cells, inducing bone formation. The finding of osseous metaplasia in colorectal carcinoma does not change the prognosis, although is very important to differentiate this entity from carcinosarcoma, that have poor prognosis. Objective: The aim of this study was to use immunohistochemical staining to estimate the tumour deposits nature in colorectal carcinoma. Method: \u0421olorectal carcinomas were selected from 50 histologically analyzed tumours with tumour deposits in peritumoural zones or with distant tumour deposits. Six parts of primary tumours and fat tissue were analyzed. Two hundred seventy six slides were examinated. A mean of ten blocks were sampled for each tumour. Staining for Neuron Specific Enolase and Smooth Muscle Actin to identify perineural invasion or angioinvasion were used. Results: Our results show that tumour deposits observed in 21 % were peritumoural, 19 % tumour deposits were associated with angioinvasion, 10 % tumour deposits were associated with perineural invasion, 8 % tumour deposits were associated with lymph nodes. True tumour deposits without association with any histology structures were evident in 42 % of cases. Different types of tumour deposits were met in all cases, more then three types in 16 %. Conclusion: Our findings suggest the role of adjunct techniques to evaluate the carcinoma invasion in paracolon fat tissue, to find perineural invasion or angioinvasion and identify true tumour deposits. Tumour deposits are heterogenic group with different subtypes. Tumour deposits can be used as prognostic indicator for colorectal carcinomas associated with metastatic potential.",

Results: A 61-year-old man was submitted to surgery for a rectal tumour microscopically characterized after the excision as MANEC. A year after the initial surgery, he presented with a scalp lesion histopathologically consistent with metastasis from the neuroendocrine component of his previous carcinoma. The patient died 4-months after the diagnosis of metastatic disease. The second case is about a 45-year-old man who underwent surgical biopsy due to mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Microscopic examination was consistent with lymph node metastasis of a large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary site. Immunohistochemical co-expression of CD-X2 and CK20 along with absence of TTF-1 immunoreactivity suggested gastrointestinal tract investigation which revealed a MANEC of the descending colon. No followup is available up to date. Both colon tumours consisted of a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma component, noninvasive beyond muscularis mucosa (intramucosal) and with no positive lymph nodes. Conclusion: Our cases support the impression that, concerning MANE Cs, patient outcome is based mainly on the neuroendocrine component.

This is why it is possible to use changes in immune system as an additional criterion for diagnosis in IBD. Method: Our research includes ileal biopsies from 50: 18 patients with CD, 11 patients with IBD unclassified (IBDU) and 21 patients with normal mucosa, they were chosen as control group. We performed an immunohisrochemical (IHC) examination of ileal biopsies with antibodies directed against CD3.

This method may avoid resective surgery, providing lymph node involvement risk factors can be evaluated. This is in contrast to standard endoscopic mucosal resection, where fragmentation precludes adequate pathological evaluation. This study explores pathological results and clinical follow-up among CR-ESD treated patients. Method: Between 2006 and 2014, 192 CR-ESDs were performed at St-Luc Hospital. Lesion location, TNM classification, grade, surface area, lateral margins, and width and depth of sub-mucosal invasion were prospectively recorded. Endoscopic and clinical outcomes were also observed. Results: We found low and high grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma in 51 (26. 6 %) , 74 (38.5 %) and 67 (34.9 %), respectively. Twenty-two (11.5 %) lesions were pT1. Of these, 16 (72.7 %) were pT1sm1 and 6 (27.2 %) were pT1sm2/3. Subsequent surgery was indicated for 6/16 (37.5 %) pT1sm1 and all pT1sm2/3. No surgeries showed residual carcinoma (pT0 N0). In the remaining 10/16 pT1sm1 (62.5 %), follow-up did not reveal recurrence. Conclusion: In this large series of CR lesions treated with ESD, specimen integrity allowed us to make clear diagnoses and clinical decisions.

Objective: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene variants influence the enterohepatic metabolism of cholesterol and bile acids. Some APOE polymorphisms have been associated with the decrease of cholesterol absorption in colon and with the increase of excretion secondary bile acids. These factors revealed to have an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. This study aimed to investigate the association between APOE common isoforms and CRC. Method: FFPE non-tumoural colonic mucosa of 100 CRC biopsies was compared with blood samples of 100 healthy controls as a case-control study. APOE polymorphisms (E2/E3/E4) were genotyped by PCR-SSP, through commercially available kits. Results: APOE E2E2 isoform was associated with CRC prevalence (10 vs 0 %; P < 0.001), while the remaining isoforms were correlated with CRC absence. In contrast, APOE E4E4 genotype were only present in control subjects (0 vs 8 %; P < 0.005). Conclusion: These findings provided insight into the potential role APOE polymorphisms as risk factor for CRC whose dysregulation is associated with higher levels of secondary bile acids production which correlates with increased risk for CRC. Moreover, E4 form of APOE could, somehow, inhibit these pathways being a CRC protective factor. These results suggest that APOE E2 and E4 genotypes can influence CRC risk. Objective: Genetic changes in MTHFR gene are associated with folate metabolism deregulation. This metabolism influences the synthesis of purines, the hypometylation of the global DNA and hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, which can be associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. The aim of the study was to explore the association between common polymorphisms MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) and CRC prevalence. Method: FFPE non-tumoural colonic mucosa of 100 CRC biopsies was compared with blood samples of 100 healthy controls as a case-control study. MTHFR common polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) were genotyped by PCR-SSP, through commercially available kits. Results: MTHFR 677TT (40 vs 21 %; P < 0.005; OR = 2.5; 95 % CI 1.3 to 4.7) and MTHFR 1298CC (42 vs 22 %; P < 0.005; OR = 2.6; 95 % CI 1.4 to 4.8) mutated genotype were linked to CRC prevalence, while the remaining genotypes were associated with CRC absence. Conclusion: Mutated genotypes have been associated to low activity of the enzyme, consequently decreasing the efficiency of folate metabolism. Deregulation of MTHFR gene seems to be associated with a decrease of MTHFR enzyme activity that leads folate downregulation and therefore to CRC predisposal. These findings provided insight into the potential pathogenesis of MTHFR common polymorphisms in CRC predisposal and prognostic.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that aberrations of the epigenetic pathway may be implicated in the metastatic potential of colorectal carcinomas. The heterogeneity between primary and metastatic tumours needs to be accounted for in the evaluation of potential therapeutic targets. Objective: Osseous metaplasia is rarely detected in the gastrointestinal tract, in benign tumours. Heterotopic osseous metaplasia is a relatively infrequent finding and is more commonly seen in degenerative and reparative conditions than in neoplasms. Most of the reported cases are associated with malignant lesions. Method: We are reporting a rare case of an inflammatory polyp in a 31 years old male who came to our hospital because he noticed blood in the stools and pain during defecation. Results: Colonoscopic examination revealed a solitary polypoid lesion located in the rectum. On pathologic gross examination, the polyp was a 57 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 20 mm fragment, gray-yellow mucosa covered and soft consistency. It was submitted in total for histopathological examination. Microscopically, H&E stained sections showed that polyp was composed of inflammatory granulation tissue with numerous capillaries and accumulations of neutrophilic granulocytes and lymphocytes. Fragments of wellformed bony spicules were also found. Conclusion: Benign lesions with osseus metaplasia are often seen with a histological background of active chronic inflammation and/or ulceration. Different mechanisms have been suggested but the pathogenesis of osseous metaplasia still remains unknown.",

Chronic inflammatory colitis similar to IBD has been described, but the association of IBD and GS is probably questionable. The histopathological findings can be quite variable in morphology, so the diagnosis may become a challenge, especially without clinical data. Objective: To compare CD34+ and CD105+ tumour blood vessels in intratumor (IT) and peritumor (PT) areas of rectal cancers and correlation with TNM staging and inflammation. Method: Fifty cases of rectal cancer were immunohistochemically processed to highlight tumour blood vessels by using two endothelial markers CD34 and Endoglin (CD105). Comparative analysis of microvascular density (MVD) assessed by using these two markers was performed and MVD values were then correlated with biological and TNM staging parameters. Results: A higher MVD was registered for both PT and IT areas compared with normal adjacent rectal mucosa. MVD-CD34-PT had a statistically significant correlation with T (p = 0,004) but not with N or M. MVD-CD-105 IT correlated with N (p = 0,004) and T factor (p = 0,004) while MVD-CD105-PT had no correlations with TNM parameters. Leukocytosis but not anemia correlated with MVD-CD105-IT (p = 0,027) and MVD-CD105-PT (p = 0,011). Tumour inflammatory infiltrate showed a significant correlation with MVD-CD34-PT but not with CD105-MVD. Conclusion: Our study revealed the need of a differential evaluation of CD34 and CD105 tumour vessels for IT and PT areas. Correlations found between CD105-MVD, TNM parameters and leukocytosis sustain that differential evaluation of tumour vessels in rectal cancers may have a prognostic and therapeutic impact. Objective: Multiorgan tumour involvement is condition usually leading to consideration of metastatic stage of tumour. Therefore histologic confirmation of each of them should be done whenever it is possible. Method: Routine histologic and immunohistochemical examination. Results: We present a case of a 52-year-old man initially diagnosed with well differentiated sigmoid adenocarcinoma (stage T3N2) and radiologically described liver metastases. Radiofrequent ablation of 21 metastatic liver tumours as well as resection of five more liver metastases were performed. However, immunohistochemical examination revealed liver metastases of serotonin producing well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma suggesting metastatic NETG2 with Ki-67 index of 2,5 %. Additional CT imaging revealed pancreatic mass measuring 30 mm leading to possible primary site of NETG2. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed as well as rectum resection for recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma. Surprisingly, after histological and immunochistochemical examination pancreatic mass appeared to be non-Hodgkin lymphoma of follicular type grade I. Immunoprofile of concurrent peripancreatic lymph node metastases of neuroendocrine carcinoma showed no CDX-2, TTF-1 and PAX-8 expression. To date, no primary site of neuroendocrine carcinoma was found. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge synchronous presentation of colorectal adenocarcinoma, hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma and non-Hodgkin pancreatic lymphoma have not yet been reported. Objective: Malignization of extra-ovarian endometriosis is extremely rare and associated with a specific histology such as endometrioid and CCC. LS patients have increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and other malignancies. Women with LS endometrium and ovary tumours present as sentinel at least as commonly as for colorectal cancer. We report a case of a woman with a clear cell carcinoma arising over endometriosis of the wall of rectum. Method: We describe clinic-pathological features of a 49 years old woman presenting with a rectal neoplasm. Results: On CT: thickness of the rectal wall. On endoscopic biopsies, is made a diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma. The histopathology of surgical resection shows a clear cell carcinoma arising on a endometriosis of rectum wall, evidencing a transition between endometriosis and CCC. The carcinoma-inmunoprofile was: CK7+, ER+, PgR+ /CK20-,CDX2-/ MLH1-,PMS2-. Patient medical files shows a past hysterectomy due to leiomyomas and, 7 years ago, a right hemicolectomy due to a medullary carcinoma with MLH1-/PMS2-and fulfilling three of the Bethesda criteria. Conclusion: Adenocarcinoma from endometriosis is rarely described at colon-rectum. Our patient fulfill three of the Bethesda criteria for LS, have a CCC histology, more closely related with LS, and present MLH1-,PMS2-on immunohistochemistry.",

In one patient the right hemicolectomy showed involvement of cecum, appendix, and ileocecal valve by tumour classified as type C (adenocarcinoma ex goblet cell carcinoid, poorly differentiated carcinoma type). The tumour of the fourth patient proved to be difficult to classify as type A or B (adenocarcinoma ex goblet cell carcinoid), and an expert who was consulted also found it challenging to classify. Conclusion: GCC, an uncommon tumour almost exclusively found in the appendix, was first described in 1974. The aim of this study is to assess the practicality of the three-tiered histologic classification published by Tang et al. Considering the rarity of this tumour and the resulting lack of vast experience, even among experts, this classification, particularly the distinction between types A and B, appears not to be reproducible. The significance of separating types A and B based on some overlapping histomorphologic features is questioned. A two-tiered classification has been proposed by Wang et al.

Nazarovs Objective: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell diseases characterized by cytopenias and dysplasia in one or more of cell lineages. The common pathological manifestations of dysplasia are nuclear fragments and multinuclearity of erythroid cells, hypogranulation/ hyposegmentation of the granulocytes, and micromegakaryocytes. We aimed to group the dysplastic features in MDS to organize a useful, schematic approach for pathologists to achieve the accurate diagnosis. Method: The demographical and histomorphological features of BM aspirates and biopsies of 40 MDS cases were revised and regrouped. The cellularity of BM biopsy and the percentage of blasts in aspirates and biopsies, confirmed by CD34 and CD117 immunostaining, were compared and noted. Results: Twenty two female (55 %) and 18 male (45 %) patients with a mean age of 69. 17 were included. The mean cellularity of biopsies was 49.2 %. The highest dysplastic lineage was erythroid lineage (75 %) in aspirates and the most common dysplastic features were nuclear abnormalities and binuclear erythroid cells. However, megacaryocytic lineage was the highest dysplastic lineage in biopsies (84 %) and the most common dysplastic feature was found as hypolobulation/ monolobulation. The mean percentage of blastic cells was 2.55 % in aspirates and 3.62 % in biopsies. Conclusion: The most common dysplastic lineages and features should be remembered and investigated on every BM aspirate and biopsy by every pathologist in order to reach an accurate diagnosis of MDS.",

A combined treatment consisting of chemotherapy and radiotherapy leads to a satisfactory outcome in patients with this uncommon neoplasm. The current results supported it's good prognosis at early stage. Objective: Frozen section lymph node analysis is of paramount importance in diagnosis and therapy for mainly tumoural pathologies. This study was performed to evaluate frozen section analysis of lymph nodes and propose ways to improve its performance. Method: We undertook a retrospective study including 185 frozen section examinations performed in pathology department of the Military Hospital of Tunis, during a 5-year period (January 2008-December 2012) that we compared to definitive histologic results. Results: We received single lymph nodes in 153 cases and lymph node curettages in 32 cases. Lymph node curettages were for urologic cancers in 23 cases (71, 87 %) and head and neck cancers in nine cases (28, 12 %). The sensitivity was 89, 2 %. The specificity and the positive predictive value were 100 %. The negative predictive value was 97, 4 %. The concordance was 93 %. The disconcordance, which was 7 %, was due to 4 false negative cases including 3 patients with a Hodgkin lymphoma and 1 patient with a B cell lymphoma whose frozen section examinations concluded to reactive lymph nodes. Conclusion: Our results put emphasis on the diagnostic relevance of the frozen section analysis. To improve its efficacy, a closer collaboration between surgeons and pathologists is necessary. Objective: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is one of the most common lymphomas in the world. It is usually a primary disease but also it can develop secondary as a result of progression of low grade lymphomas. In most cases the disease begins in lymph nodes. Hans's algorithm divides cases using immunohistochemical antibodies CD10, BCL6 and MUM1 to subtypes: germinal center-like (GCB-like) and non-germinal centerlike (non-GCB-like). Former used to be linked to better prognosis and later to worse prognosis. Method: Our research has included 92 patients whom were diagnosed at the Institute for Oncology of Vojvodina since 2003 to 2011. They were treated according to modern standard protocols including Rituximab. We have used immunohistochemical antibodies CD10, BCL6 and MUM1 to follow Hans's algorithm.

It is defined as lymphoma occurring in the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord or eyes without evidence of lymphoma outside the CNS. Eighteen patients with primary CNS lymphoma were analyzed for their clinico-histopathological characteristics and followedup for the treatment and subsequent management in Neurosurgery, and Medical and Radiation Oncology. The temporoparietal and parietal region was the commonest location of CNS lymphoma; a mean age of 54,68 years and an age range of 33-83 years. Females outnumbered males with a ratio of 1.25:1. The commonest presentation was headache. This was followed by neurological deficits. All the patients histologically had diffuse B-cell lymphoma. Two patients had multiple lesions. Four of the patients died within 2 years. Four of the patients could not be followed. In conclusion the incidence of primary CNS lymphomas is increasing not only in patients with AIDS, but also in the non-AIDS population and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all tumours of the CNS. Objective: The assessment of risk factors predisposing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Method: In our study we reevaluated 30 bone marrow biopsies (BMB) from patients diagnosed with MDS, in according to the p53 protein expression of the myeloid cells, detected by the immunohistochemistry (IHC). We applied digital morphometry method to quantify the p53 positive myeloid cells and the CD34 positive blasts. The count of positive p53 cells was compared with extent of blast infiltration, microvessel density and survival periode used correlation analysis.",

Fascin and CD68 were positive but do not differentiate between the two. Negative stain for CD23, CD21, CD35, and clusterin excluded follicular cell sarcoma. p53 showed focal, weak nuclear staining. The patient is currently under chemotherapy, 4 months from diagnosis. Conclusion: Our diagnosis was that of interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma and was substantiated by the immunohistochemical stains. Method: First diagnosis was established before a year, presenting with a symptoms of weakness, fever, night sweats and lymphadenopathy. Back than, refused bone marrow biopsy. Diagnosis was based on the following results of the flow citometry: in the periferal blood count was found 85 % lymphocytes CD45+, with the CLL SCORE 5/5 (FMC7-, CD79b-, CD23+, CD5+, sIg-). Diagnose of the CLL was established. Results: After 1 year patient was adimitted to the hospital having abovementioned pulmonary symptoms. Now, biopsy of the bone marrow was performed and pathohistology revealed supressed hematopoesis regarding diffuse infiltraton of the bone marrow with immunoblastic appearance medium large and large lymphocytes, imunohistochemicaly positive for CD20+, MUM1 +, bcl6+, negative for CD23, CD5, SOX11, CD3, CD10, CD11c, Cyclin D1, TdT.

Objective: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal proliferative disorder of hematopoietic stem cell and is characterized by the presence of \"bcr-abl\" fusion gene. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the minimal residual disease by RQ-PCR assay in patients with CML treated with Imatinib mesylate or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Method: Sixty CML patients, 34 males and 26 females, median age 40 years (12-71) hava 128 RQ-PCR analyses at different times during their therapy: 49 CML patients treated with Gleevec for a median of 6 months after they achieved complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) and 12 CML patients after allograft for a median of 24 months. Results: By analyzing the value of bcr-abl/abl levels measured by realtime quantitative PCR, we show the patients could be divided into 3 groups (1) in 49 patients transcripts level continues to decline; in 13 of these patients bcr-abl transcript became undetectable on repeated testing.",

Conclusion: RQ-PCR is a sensitive tool to monitor minimal residual disease for the early detection of relapse and the assessment of treatment response in patients with CML. Results: The biopsy presents a malignant proliferation occupying the dermis. This is composed of large polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with pleomorphism and prominent nucleoli. Mitosis and abundant foci of necrosis were diffusely observed. Immunohistochemistry study results: -Tumour cells express CD68, CD163, Lysozyme and leukocyte common antigen CD45. -CKAE1-AE3, EMA, S100, HMB45, CD20, CD3 and CD4, CD30, CD15, CD1a, CD21, CD35, myeloperoxidase and CD33 are negative. The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine and prednisone and after 4 months the clinical evaluation of the lesions show improved with no complete regression. Conclusion: We report a patient with primary histiocytic sarcoma with unique skin involvement. The differential diagnosis includes the interdigitating dendritic cells sarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, melanoma and other sarcomas. This requires immunohistochemical markers for the diagnosis. In the literature review, the majority of the cases of histiocytic sarcoma are diagnosed in advanced clinical course but there are a few reports with better improvement in patients treated in the initial presentation of the disease. In the cases reported in the literature, the skin manifestation as a unique presentation is also rare because a great number of the cases has another involvement before the cutaneous lesions. Objective: Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS), is a rare hematolymphoid neoplasm with a close resemblance to the normal FDC and a biological behavior more like that of sarcoma. Most of them arise in lymph nodes, although extranodal presentations, including oral cavity and tonsils as most common ones, have been reported. Method: A 52-year-old man, presented with a globus sensation of the right pharynx because of slowly enlarged mass. CT and preoperative first FNB estimation indicated that the tumour could be a lymphoma. A right tonsillectomy with ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes excision, was performed. Postoperatively, local adjuvant rathiotherapy was planned.",

Conclusion: More prevalent in men, particularly after the middle age, since the first report, it has been described in several organ systems, most commonly in the pancreas as well as the hepatobiliary tract, salivary glands, orbit, and lymph nodes. However, besides our case, just one has been described in the adrenal gland, consolidating the place of this organ in the expanding list of possible targets of the disease. Objective: Cancer to cancer metastasis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is rarely described in literature.

Method: The case concerns a 57-years old male, with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of ear and external acoustic meatus with suspect metastatic neck disease, and with previously diagnosed CLL/SLL. Radical surgical neck dissection was performed. Fifty-four lymph nodes were collected, which size were from 2 to 18 mm (mediana 8 mm). Those lymph nodes were hystopathologically and immunohistochemically analyzed. Objective: Although secondary involvement of the spleen by NHL is frequent, concurrent splenic involvement by marginal zone lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation and DLBCL has never been reported. Method: We present a case of a 106 gr spleen, focally involved by post GC-DLBCL with some hybrid features, in a 76-year old man with dry cough and low grade fever, in association with subtle infiltration of the surrounding parenchyma by a low grade B-NHL with marginal and/or plasmacytic differentiation and identical kappa light chain expression.

Stage III disease (N = 9,45 %) was common in pediatric group, while stage II disease (N = 18,90 %) in others. Thirty-six cases (90 %) were alive, while four (10 %) were deceased. Rate of relapses was slightly higher in adults (15 %,N = 3) than children cases (10 %,N = 2). With microRNA sequencing it was determined that miR-1273e, miR-4322, miR-5008-5p, and miR-6511b-5p were upregulated, while miR-508-5p was downregulated in pediatric tumours. Conclusion: These results suggest that microRNAs may play an important role in the biology of pediatric Mixed Cellularity Hodgkin lymphomas and may be useful in developing therapies targeting microRNAs. . The disease is often symptomatic (10/13). They were presenting with localized (3/10) or generalized adenopathy (7/10). They occur more frequently in men than in women (9/13) and have a peak incidence in the seventh decade. Macroscopically, lymph nodes usually (10/13) present with homogenous fish-flesh replacement of most if not all of the structure. Occasionally (2/13), the involvement is only partial. Morphologically, DLBC typically replaces the normal architecture of the underlying lymph nodal in a diffuse pattern (12/13). Lymph node involvement may be complete (8/13), partial (3/13) or interfollicular (1/13). The malignant proliferation was composed of medium sized to large lymphoid cells with vesicular nuclei and fine chromatin. DLBC express various pan B markers.

Lazaris, V. Zolota, V. Labropoulou, A. Kourakli, A. Symeonidis Results: 101 (55.8 %) patients had fibrosis grade 0-1 (group-I), 38 (21 %) an intermediate grade 1-2 (group-II) and 42 (23.2 %) grade \u22652 (group-III). Male/female ratio was 1.73/group-I and 3.00/groups-II+III (p < 0.01). An Int-2/High IPSS was found in 11 of group-1 patients and in 25 of groups-II+III (10.9 vs 31.2 %, p < 0.01). Group-II+III patients had hypercellular marrow (p = 0.0052), higher marrow blast percentage (7.4 \u00b1 6.3 vs 2.8 \u00b1 3.7 %, p < 0.001), higher serum ferritin (p = 0.023), CRP (p = 0.003) and LDH (p = 0.0034), and lower WBC count (p = 0.038) and albumin levels (p = 0.0094). Sixteen patients from group-I and 33 from groups-II+III evolved to a more aggressive MDS or AML (p < 0.001). Median overall survival was 28.7 and 20.1 months for group-I and -II+III, respectively (p < 0.01). Objective: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy of mature B-lymphocytes that can arise de novo or as a result of transformation from a lower grade lymphoma. No significant association between DLBCL and reactive lymph node changes was previously observed.",

The diagnosis of progressive transformation of germinal centers (PTGC) associated with paracortical expansion by a CD3+,CD8+ T-cell population was made. The case is notable because of the unusual association between PTGC and DLBCL. Was PTGC only an incidental finding or could it play a role in the pathogenesis of DLBCL? Did the cytotoxic T-cells participate in this progression? DLBCL is a heterogeneous entity including various morphological and molecular subtypes, one of them characterized by bcl-6 gene rearrangements, which were also described in some PTGC cases. Conclusion: Our case might offer an insight into a possible pathway of tumorigenesis from PTGC to DLBCL, but further studies are required to conclude a causal association. Cioplea and Sticlaru have equal contribution. Case presentation: A 70 years old male patient was admitted to our Ear, Nose and Throat out-patient clinic with a palpable neck mass. Ultrasound detected multiple abnormal enlarged lymph nodes in bilateral neck region. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the largest cervical lymph node was performed and interpreted as atypical lymphoid proliferations. The lymph node excision were applied and microscopic findings were a monotonous population of small lymphocytes with scattered larger lymphoc y t e s w i t h p a l e r c h r o m a t i n a n d p r o m i n e t n u c l e o l i . Immunohistochemically, the small atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD45, CD20, PAX-5, CD5, CD23 negative for CD3, CD10, cyclin D-1, Bcl-2, EMA and RS-like cells were positive for CD15, CD30 negative for CD45, CD20, EMA. Conclusion: Transformation to Hodgkin lymphoma may occur during the course of CLL/SLL. This phenomenon must be distinguished histologically from cases of CLL/SLL that show admixed background RS-like cells. Objective: Recently MUM-1 expression has been shown in follicular lymphomas (FL) and seems to correlate with grade. We aimed to study MUM-1 expression in our FL cases including Bcl-2 negative ones. Method: 111 FL cases were chosen for the study. MUM-1 positivity was examined using immunohistochemistry by tissue microarray construction (TMA) and could be assessed in 75 of the cases due to loss of tissue samples in TMA blocks. MUM-1 positivity was defined as >20 % nuclear staining in the neoplastic follicles. Bcl-2 status was assessed with immunohistochemistry.",

MUM-1 positivity was more common in high grade cases (30 %) compared to low grade cases (10 %); and in Bcl-2 negative cases (2/5) compared to Bcl-2 positive (7/64) cases. Conclusion: MUM-1 positivity was seen to be more common not only in high grade cases but also in Bcl-2 negative cases. This seems plausible since Bcl-2 negative FLs are presumed to be derived from late germinal center B cells. Further studies with higher number of Bcl-2 negative cases are needed to confirm this observation.

Objective: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that affects millions worldwide. It was traditionally a disease from tropical and sub-tropical regions, but migration of these populations to low prevalent areas has dramatically increased the number of cases in developed countries. Method: We searched in our autopsy files from 2006 to 2015 for patients with history of SCD; we found two cases. Results: Case 1: 28-year-old male, admitted in the emergency room (ER) with lower back pain. He died unexpectedly shortly after. Case 2: 28year-old male with a history of a recent cold was admitted in the ER for severe pain referred to the back and limbs. He died unexpectedly after 3 days. At the autopsy, both presented as the main finding extensive generalized vaso-occlusive phenomena. We also observed chronic multi-organ damage related to SCD mainly in the spleen, liver, gallbladder, bone marrow and heart. Conclusion: SCD remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality.

An immunophenotype of MCL, blastoid variant, was suggested due to the overexpression of p53, high mitotic rate and high Ki-67. Conclusion: Expression of the cyclin D1 in MCL is due to the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) between IGH and cyclin D1 genes. Blastoid morphology, overexpression of p53 and a high mitotic rate could be adverse prognosticators.

However, only autopsy-based biomarker studies can give feedback for further development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, which are important part for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the patients suffered by different neurodegenerations. Conclusion: The tumour has been reported in a wide age range of the patients (12-59 years of ages, mean age is 31). A slight female dominance (1.75 / 1) is seen. Its typical localization is in the midline ventricular system, however, pineal, pontine and thalamic regions may also be involved. Although the tumour has a benign clinical course, one reported case presented as multifocal lesions with leptomeningeal spread. Therefore, the presentation and its exact response to treatment is mostly unclear. Objective: To facilitate the awareness of this distinctive lesion, we describe the histology, immunohistochemistry, and differential diagnoses of a desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma (DIG). Results: A 6-year-old girl was admitted with the chief complaint of seizure without family history. Neurological examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a hypodense area in the right temporal region, with contrast enhancing solid as well as large cystic components. A right temporal craniotomy was performed and the tumour was excised. The pathologic examination revealed a markedly desmoplastic tumour, showing deposition of dense collagen fibers. The neoplastic cell population was heterogenous, composed of spindle-shaped astrocytes with a fascicular arrangement. Scattered ganglion cells were also observed, indicating neuronal differentiation.",

            "text": "No mitosis or necrosis was present. The first component was GFAP positive, and the latter component was reactive with synaptophysin. Diagnosis of DIG was made. Conclusion: DIG is a rare supratentorial brain tumour occurring before 2 years. Until now, <60 cases of DIG have been described. The main histologic differential diagnoses are reticulin-rich desmoplastic tumours such as pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma which occur in adults, have prominent cells' lipidization and no neural component, gliofibroma which is infratentorial and lacks also the neural component, ganglioglioma which occurs in adults, and lacks of desmoplasia. Method: This is a retrospective study of 12 cases of neurocytoma diagnosed in the department of Pathology at the Rabta's hospital. We analyzed the following parameter: age, sex, histological features, and expression of GFAP, synaptophysin, and MIB1. Results: The median age was 24 years with five men and seven women. All tumours were intra-ventriclar. Signs of obstructive hydrocephalus were detectable in all patients. A feature common to all of these tumours was the isomorphous neoplastic cell population. Honeycomb architecture reminiscent of oligodendroglioma was a prominent feature in three of the neoplasms. Other distinct patterns included perivascular pseudorosettes in four cases, and cell-free neuropil islands in seven. Calcifications were observed in four cases. The mitotic activity was low. There were no cases exhibiting areas of necrosis and vascular endothelial proliferation. Immunohistochemical examinations was made in nine cases and revealed a consistent and uniform expression of synaptophysin in all neurocytomas. GFAP was negative. MIB1 was inferior to 20 % and correlated to mitotic index. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that central neurocytomas represent a tumour entity with characteristic clinical and histopathological properties. The central neurocytoma is included in the differential diagnosis of intraventricular neoplasms in young adults. Method: Our study included 60 specimens of pituitary adenomas with a well defined hormone profile immunohistochemically assessed, followed by the use of immunohistochemical staining methods with specific antibodies against PDGFs and PDGFR \u03b2. Results: Sixty six percent of total cases expressed PDGF A, with cytoplasmic and membranous pattern, and an isolated positive nuclear reaction was observed. PDGF A expression was statistically significant correlated with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (p = 0,011). PDGF B had a nuclear staining pattern in tumour cells for most of the cases, few cases having a combined nuclear and cytoplasmic pattern. PDGF B expression was noted with the highest score (+3) in case of GH-secreting adenomas (p = 0, 010).Pituitary adenomas with acidophilic cells, the majority being GH-secreting adenomas, presented an important expression of PDGFR \u03b2 in the tumour cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest the influence of the PDGF family members on the hormone profile and partially confirm these data, namely the fact that the two versions, PDGF A and PDGF B seems to have differential effects reported to the hormone profile.",

Few standard methods (FLASH (Fast Low Angle Shot), FISP (Fast Imaging with Steady State Precession), MGE (Multi Gradient Echo) and RARE (Rapid Acquisition with Refocused Echo) were optimized to produce high contrast 3D images with isotropic resolution down to 32 \u03bcm/pixel. Conclusion: High resolution 3D MRM images from FFPE tissue can be obtained at temperatures above paraffin's melting point (> 56 C). Although the resolution is far below the one in OM main advantage of 3D MRM of FFPE tissue is its nondestructive character. Even with such modest resolution (compared to OM) it could open new avenues to guide pathologists to tissue segments with actual pathology, eliminating the \"random sampling\" nature of standard histology slide generation. Method: Retrospective study of the histologically proven cases of SEGA, diagnosed between 1995 and 2015 in the Pathology Department of La Rabta's Hospital. Clinical data were reviewed for each patient and the following parameters were evaluated: gender, age at diagnosis, initial clinical symptoms and site of onset, main imaging findings and histological features of the lesion. Results: A total of 11 patients with histologically SEGA were investigated. The gender ratio was 1.2 for a male predominance (6 males and 5 females). The average age was 21.7 years (range 5 to 53). Clinical manifestations were presented in an acute manner, such as symptomatic hydrocephalus, or an acute intratumoral hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging showed intraventricular tumours associated to hydrocephalus, mass effect or intratumoral hemorrhage. Histologically, tumours were composed of three types of cells: spindle, gemistocytic and ganglion-like. Conclusion: SEGA is benign, WHO grade 1, slowly growing tumour linked to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but it can occurs also in patients without TSC. Parenchymal extension and worrisome histological features, such as necrosis, mitoses, microvascular proliferation or pleomorphism, are unusual in these tumours, but can occur.",

Method: A 15 years old girl presented with weakness of the extremities. The MRI exam of the thoracic and lumbal spine revealed a multifocal subdural extramedullar tumour mass involving the Th1 to Th7 and the Th10 to L2 segment, with compressive effect on the medulla and the conus medullaris. The patient underwent surgery and the specimen was referred to histopathological analysis. Results: Histological sections demonstrate a glial tumour with biphasic appearance including astrocytic (GFPA, Vimentin positive; Synaptophysin, p53 and Neu N negative) and oligodendroglial-like (OLIG 2 positive) areas. Tumour cellularity and proliferative activity are low. Focally, the presence of palisading necrosis, glomeruloid capillary proliferation, and increased mitotic count was noted (up to 4 mitosis/ 10 high power fields). The diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma with atypical histological characteristics was made. Conclusion: In this case, a tumour has atypical histological characteristics and we highlight the importance of recognition this atypical focuses in the tumours because they are associated with decreased survival when compared with typical PA. Objective: Clear cell meningioma (CCM) represents a rare variant of meningioma localized mainly in spine or cerebellopontine angle and affecting primarily younger patients. We report a case of CCM in a middleaged woman. Method: A 50-year-old woman underwent craniotomy and excision of a meningeal tumour measuring 6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3,5 cm, localized in the left frontal lobe. Morphological and immunohistochemical study of the specimen was performed. Results: A cellular neoplasm with a focal syncytial-whorling growth pattern was identified. The cytoplasm of the polygonal neoplastic cells was predominantly clear or vacuolated (PAS: +, PAS-Diastase:-, mucicarmine:-) while the nuclei were round-ovoid to slightly elongated with visible nucleoli, without obvious mitotic activity. Many congested vascular channels or others with hyalinized walls were distributed within the tumour. The tumour cells immunohistochemically expressed EMA, Vimentin, CD56, Progesterone Rec. (approximately 40 % of the cells), whereas were negative for Pankeratin, GFAP, Chromogranin, RCC. Ki67 index was 5 %. The histopathological features were consistent with a diagnosis of a CCM. Conclusion: CCM is a grade II meningioma variant which is important to be distinguished from other, metastatic (mainly clear cell renal cell carcinoma) or not, neoplasms. The tumour demonstrates a higher recurrence rate compared to other meningioma variants and the extent of initial surgical resection seems to be the most important prognostic parameter. Objective: Atypical teratoid/ rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT) is a highly malignant CNS tumour predominantly manifested in children. It has divergent differentiation along epithelial, mesenhymal, neuronal or glial lines and typically containing rhabdoid cells with primitive neuroectodermal cells. Our aim is to present pathological hallmarks of atypical teratoid/ rhabdoid tumour on CNS, as a rare entity which is frequently misdiagnosed. Method: We present a male 10-month old patient with AT/RT. To the institute of pathology from the University Clinic in Skopje have been delivered 7 soft tissue fragments of irregular shape and size, with dimensions 3 \u00d7 2,5 \u00d7 1,5 cm for the bigger fragment and 1-1,5 cm for the others. Results: The tissue was gray-pink to gray-whitish with medium coarse consistency with neovascularization and necrosis. Microscopically the tumour is composed of round cells with polygonal nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent eosinophilic nucleolus. From the applied immunohistochemical methods, the cells were positive for: Vimentin, EMA, CD99, CD34, S100, GFAP. The proliferative index Ki67 was nearly 50 %. Conclusion: From the described morphology of the tumour and the immunohistochemical analysis, the diagnose of AT/ RT (WHO gr. IV) was made. This can be confirmed with the diagnostic methods that were used earlier like CT and MR. (2007); Rhabdoid Meningiomas are the rare subtype of meningiomas and are accepted as grade 3. Although many has malignant morphology, early recurrence rate and poor outcome, there are case reports stating to only rhabdoid features but no any other malignant properties. We submit a case of rhabdoid meningioma which has no malignant histopathological features except rhabdoid morphology. Method: A 55-year-old male who presented with headache of whose MRI of the brain demonstrated a left fronto-parietal iso-dense, contrastenhancing dural based mass of 27 \u00d7 22 mm diameter which has neighboring sylvian fissure. The tumour was resected. Results: Histopathological examination of the tumour showed sheets of entirely rhabdoid cells with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm, eccentric nuclei and prominent nucleolus resemble described in rhabdoid tumours in other sites. This case did not consist histological features of malignancy, such as mitosis, high Ki-67 proliferative indices, necrosis and brain invasion. Immunohistochemically tumour cells expressed vimentin, EMA, progesteron and INI-1. The proliferation index Ki-67 was < 2 %. Histopathological diagnosis was rhabdoid meningioma without malignant morphological features. Conclusion: There are a few cases of patients with rhabdoid meningioma were reported in the literature. Most of the reports state that rhabdoid meningiomas are highly aggressive tumours. But a minority of meningiomas with rhabdoid features lack malignant properties as the presented case. The question is the malignant properties belong to rhabdoid features or the other histological features such as mitosis, necrosis and brain invasion. The proper answer most probably lies in the long term follow up of long series of tumour cases. Objective: Solitary fibrous tumours (SFT) are ubiqitous mesenchymal neoplasms putative fibroblastic origin. SFT may also occur in the meninges and central nervous system parenchyma; in addition, spinal cord and spinal nevre involment has been reported. A 60 years-old-female paitent was admitted to neurochirurgia department with painfull and numbness of neck, arms, legs for the last 2 months. Her cervical T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well circumflunced and hypointensive lesion with 27 mm lenght at right C2 vertebra level and inferior foramen magnum that was located intradural extramedullary. Lesion was presented encapsulated at gross of pathology 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 cm diameter and cut surface of color off white. Histopathologically, uniform spindle cells arranged in interlacing fascicles with deposition of scanty collogen between cells. Tumour cells were with elongated nuclei with slighytly granular chromatin. \u0130mmunhistochemically, strong and diffuse immunopositivity with Vimentin, CD34, CD99 and weak immunpositivity with Bcl-2 were seen. Tumour cells were negative for SMA, Desmin, S-100, EMA, GFAP, CD68, CD31 and CD38. Conclusion: Our case differs from other spinal SFT cases by being located in cervical area and inferior foramen magnum. Only %37 of those cases are found intradural and extramedullary. We presented that our case settled in cervical, intradural rare location.",

Herein, we report a 23 year-old male with CCM in 5th lumbar vertebra. Results: Peroperatively, the mass was submitted for frozen section. It was a well-circumscribed mass of 1.4 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 0.8 cm, macroscopically. During frozen section, a lesion composed of mostly spindle cells showing no sign of malignancy in a collageneous background containing rich vascular network was detected, microscopically. It was diagnosed as \"suggestive of schwannoma or fibrous meningioma\" at frozen section. Suprisingly, extensive solid sheets of polygonal cells with clear cytoplasms accompanying spindle cell component were detected, in parraffin sections. Immunohistochemically, positivity for vimentin, EMA, and PR; negativity for RCC, CD10, GFAP, pancytokeratin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CEA were detected in the tumour cells. Ki-67 proliferation index was 1-2 %. Conclusion: It should be considered that CCM may be misdiagnosed as fibrous meningioma or schwannoma in frozen section due to the collagen-rich stroma and/or freezing artifact. The periphery of the lesion should be evaluated to find out the reminiscent of the grade I conventional meningioma pattern, microscopically. Metastatic carcinomas (particularly renal cell carcinoma) should be ruled out by immunohistochemistry. Objective: Inflammatory myopathies (IM) are rare heterogeneous conditions, comprising polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis and necrotizing myopathy alongside myopathies associated with connective tissue diseases or paraneoplasia. We aim to assess and quantify the morphological parameters of the muscle biopsies in cases with myopathic pattern in conventional myography and establish correlations between specific histopathological and electromyographic (EMG) features. Method: 42 patients with IM were prospectively enrolled; we performed conventional EMG, as well as quantitative assay (QEMG) of multi-motor unit potential (MUP) and interferential pattern. In 21 patients with myopathic pattern, muscle biopsy was performed and histopathological parameters were quantified: necroinflammatory activity, fiber size variability, endomysial/perimysial fibrosis and structural abnormalities. Results: We found positive correlations between fibrillationsnecroinflammatory activity score (Pearson coefficient 0.582, p = 0.006), fibrillations-score of fiber size variability (Pearson coefficient 0.603, p = 0.004) and negative correlations between positive sharp waves-type II fiber atrophy (Pearson coefficient 0.512, p = 0.018), EMG pattern-type II fiber atrophy (Pearson coefficient 0.521, p = 0.015). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the value of EMG and histopathological examination in the accurate diagnosis of IM and the usefullness of quantifying morphological parameters. Objective: The most common intramedullary tumours are ependymomas and astrocytomas. Excluding the sacro-coccygeal form often seen in neonates, teratomas in the spinal canal are rare. It consists of tissues from all three embryonic layers. Method: A 30-year-old female complained of backache for 2-3 months. She had no neurological deficits. Imaging studies showed, intradural tumour formation extending to intramedullary with different densities in the spinal canal at T12 and L1 levels. Findings indicated that the tumour included heterogeneous tissues. The tumour was subtotally removed. Results: Grossly, the lesional tissue (1,7 \u00d7 1,1 \u00d7 1,1 cm) was a dirty white mass which was containing solid and cystic (1 \u00d7 1 cm) components. Histologically, various findings were observed. There were cysts lined with columnar and stratified squamous epithelium, sebaceous glands, mucous glands, peripheral nerve bundles, adipose tissue, vessels surrounded by dense hyalinized tissue with calcification. Histological analysis demonstrated a mature teratoma with three ingredients: ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal elements. Conclusion: Though sacrococcygeal teratoma in newborn babies has frequently been reported, spinal teratoma in adults is uncommon. While only a very small proportion of CNS teratomas occur in the spinal cord, they need to be considered in differential diagnosis. Total resection is the treatment of choice, it is important to resect as much of the tumour as possible while preserving all neural tissue. Objective: Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is thought to represent a morphologic continuum, ranging from fibrous \"classic\" STF to cellular SFT, the latter corresponding to most \"so-called\" hemangiopericytomas (HPCs). Although now widely accepted for soft tissue (ST), the consensus is not so clear in the central nervous system (CNS). We aim to compare and understand if it is safe to consider HPC/SFT of the CNS and of ST as the same entity. Method: Retrospective review of all cases (n = 22) identified as SFT/ HPC from a single institution in a 10-year period (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) , assessing patient demographics, tumour location, prognostic indicators (size, margins, cellularity, mitotic index, pleomorphism, necrosis and hemorrhage) and follow-up. The cases were grouped in CNS and extra-CNS location, and data were analyzed for statistical differences between groups. Results: We had 11 patients in both groups, with equal gender distribution (4 males; 7 females). Of all variables studied, tumour size was significantly higher in ST-SFT (mean = 9,27 cm vs 3,87 cm, p = 0,013) and the 1-year and 5-year event-free is significantly lower in CNS-SFT (64 % vs 100 %, p = 0,034; 14 % vs 75 %, p = 0,019 Objective: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) include a group of tumours that originate from the peripheral nerves or show differentiation along various elements of the nerve sheath, namely, Schwann cells, perineural fibroblasts, or fibroblasts. MPNSTs occur in deep soft tissues of trunk and extremities, but superficial primary MPSNT with a cutaneous or subcutaneous origin have rarely been reported. Method: A 22- year-old male patient presented with a swelling in the right forearm that had been existing since childhood. Microscopically, multinodular tumour organization was observed which cover the whole dermis and extending subcutaneus adipose tissue. Results: The tumour consisted of atypical epitheloid cells which some had spindled-shape, had ovaloid-round, hyperchromatic-vesicular nucleus and widely eosinophilic cytoplasm. Regresive changes like necrosis, hyalinization were seen. The mitotic activity was high. Our case showed S-100, Vimentin, GFAP, CD68 positivity with over-expression of Ki-67 (mean 30 %). CK, CK7, CK19, EMA, HMB45, Desmin, CA125, CD31, CD34, Factor VIII did not expressed in 'MPNST of the dermis' and were used exclude other tumours. By this findings, it was diagnosed as MPNST of cutaneous tissue. Objective: Dermal nerve sheat myxoma (DNSM) is a rare benign peripheral nerve sheat tumour, arises in patients ranging in age from 8 to 84 years, and are equally frequent in males and females. Histologically it has a characteristic appearance. Treatment of DNSM is a complete excision as recurrence may occur. However, the tumour is considered benign and has no evidence of malignant potential. Method: A 45-year-old woman, who presented with a small nodule with a diameter of 1,5 cm. asymptomatic, and growing slowly and superficially located in her third finger. The tumour was radically removed. Results: The lesion was circumscribed, typically forms a multinodular mass, and had a abundant myxoid matrix. The tumour nodules were separated by delicate fibrous septa and composed of small epithelioid, ring-like, stellate and spindled neoplastic schwann cells. The nucleus of most tumour cells were small, rounded, or ovoid, with a moderate amount of chromatin. Mitotic figures were uncommon. The neoplastic schwann cells were immunoreactive for S100 protein, GFAP, EMA, vimentina. Conclusion: DNSM show true nerve-sheat differentiation by ultrastructural analysis. Incomplete removal is associated with a high rate of local recurrence. The main differential diagnoses arise with: neurothekeoma, superficial angiomyxoma, neurofibroma myxoid, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans mixoide. Objective: Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours (pPNET) are highly malignant small round cell tumours with a poor prognosis. Few pPNET cases of the head and neck have been reported. We present a pPNET arising in the parotid gland. Method: A 18-year-old female presented in our hospital with a solitary hard mass in the right cheek. Following surgical resection, pathologic examination was performed. Results: Gross examination revealed a gray-whitish firm mass, measuring 4/3/1 cm, poorly circumscribed with a heterogeneous aspect on cut section. Microscopic examination showed an infiltrating undifferentiated malignant tumour composed of hyperchromatic small cells with atypical nuclei and large areas of necrosis. The cells were PAS-positive. Also, they showed positive immunostaining for: vimentin, MNF116, EMA, S100, CD99, NSE and synaptophysin. Mib 1 was 40 % positive. Immunostaining of the tumoural cells was negative for chromogranin, CD20, CD3, CD30, CK20, CD34, desmin, myogenin and PAX-5. Conclusion: pPNET of the parotid gland is a rare and challenging diagnosis and immunohistochemistry should exclude other possible and similarly diagnoses such as lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, undifferentiated carcinoma and other small round cell tumours. Results: No significant relationship was found between the DF and DFSPs according to age distribution. However, there was significant correlation for sex, localization and diameter of the lesion between the two entities. A significant difference was found between the positivity of CD34 and D2-40 in DF and DFSPs. Conclusion: Additional immunohistochemical markers may be needed in DFs with CD34 positivity or DFSPs with myxoid degeneration and sarcomatous differentiation where the positivity of CD34 decreases. Our results showed that the higher positivity of D2-40 in DFs then in DFSPs, raises the additional helpful role of this marker in differential diagnosis of problematic cases. Objective: We present a case of desmoplastic small round cell tumour (DSRCT) in a 35-year old male patient, who was admitted to our hospital due to the presence of ascites and multiple abdominal masses. Method: Examination of tissue samples from implantations in various abdominal organs. Results: Macroscopically there were multiple coalescent tumour nodules and implantations of various size, with firm, gray-white cut surface, elastic consistency and foci of hemorrhage and necrosis. Histologically, the tumour was characterized by sharply outlined nests of small neoplastic cells surrounded by prominent desmoplastic stroma. The tumour cells had undifferentiated appearance, with scant cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei and increased apoptotic and mitotic activity. Focally, some cells exhibited epithelial differentiation. The immunoprofile showed a multi-phenotypic differentiation (immunoreactivity for cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), epithelial membrane antigen, calretinin, WT-1, vimentin, desmin, CD56, CD99 and neuron-specific enolase\u02d9Negative for smooth muscle actin, chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, CD57 and CD117). The Ki67 index was high. Genetic studies were not performed due to the patient's demise. Conclusion: DSRCT is a rare and aggressive tumour, composed of small round cells of uncertain histogenesis. The presence of the t(11;22)(p13;q12) translocation is a consistent cytogenetic feature, unique to the tumour. Despite multimodal therapy the prognosis is poor. Objective: Most intestinal mesenchymal neoplasms are gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), primary leiomyosarcoma of the small intestine (PLSI) being extremely uncommon. We describe four cases of this poorly known entity. Method: A search for our small intestinal smooth muscle tumours (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) was performed. PLSIs were identified and their clinicopathological features recorded. Results: Four PLSI instances were found (see table) . All cases were positive for desmin and negative for CD34, S100-protein and C-KIT. Conclusion: Telling PLSI and GIST apart by accurate pathology diagnosis is crucial owing to their very different prognosis and therapy. Nevertheless, as shown by our cases, quantification of PLSI histologic criteria does not allow prediction of biological behavior in individual PLSI cases. Objective: Elastofibroma dorsi is a relatively rare soft-tissue tumour, more common in women after 50. The typical presentation of ED involves a subscapular mass associated with a long history of swelling, discomfort, snapping of the scapula and can sometimes be bilateral. It was described for the first time by Jarvi and Saxen in 1961, its incidence is variable and infrequent although its true rate of incidence may be greater than that described in the literature. Method: A 54-year-old female patient, with no past medical history, presented with unilateral subscapular slow growing tumour for 1 year. The predominant symptoms were swelling, discomfort and pain. Results: Macroscopic findings showed a poorly defined fibroelastotic mass with slightly rubbery, elastic consistence measuring 12 cm \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1 cm. The cut surface showed strands of gray-white and yellow tissue. Histologically, the tumour was poorly circumscribed, and was composed of hypocellular fibrous collagenous strands admixed with large numbers of coarse, densely eosinophilic elastic fibers and entrapped mature fat cells. The elastic structures sometimes formed disks or globules. Conclusion: Elastofibroma dorsi is a rare pseudotumoral lesion of the soft tissues that most frequently affects older females. In general, once the diagnosis is suspected radiological investigation is performed. CT, MRI or sonographic images can demonstrate the characteristic streaky collagen or elastic fibers of elastofibroma dorsi in the fatty background. Nevertheless, pathologic confirmation is necessary to formally rule out a malignant tumour diagnosis.",

            "text": "Objective: Heterotopic ossification (HO) refers to the formation of bone in non-ossifying tissue. Heterotopic mesenteric ossification is a rare form of HO that is characterized by the formation of an ossifying pseudotumor at the base of the mesentery, usually following abdominal surgery. Method: We report a case of heterotopic bone formation in the mesentery. The patient was a 52-year-man, who had in hits history abdominal trauma. On laparotomy, two sharps complex mesenteric peritoneal calcifications were encountered which were excised. The largest mass measured 15 mm. Results: Microscopically, trabecular bone tissue had increased irregularly in the fat tissue of the nodules with fibrosis, which were partially lined with osteoblasts. Conclusion: Heterotopic mesenteric ossification is a benign ossifying pseudotumor with no malignant potential. The major morbidity associated with the pathology is bowel obstruction, which usually requires surgical intervention. Objective: Here we present a systematic approach to histopathological reporting of high grade myxofibrosarcoma of 54-year-old-male patient. Method: The tumour was biopsied with FNA and CNB and then the whole myxoid tumour was excised with left musculus gluteus maximus. The lesion was stained with H&E, PAS, alcian blue, Masson trichrome, Ki67, SMA, S100, CD34 and vimentin. Results: FNA material grounded the diagnosis of non epithelial neoplasia, while CNB was enough to produce diagnosis of myxoid sarcoma. The tumour lied under superficial fascia with no extension beyond deep fascia or any invasion of skin, vessels or nerves, either. The tumour was intramuscular, mainly myxoid with hypercellular areas of highly atypical cells and some bizarre giant multinucleated cells which belonged to category of high grade sarcoma. According to FNCLCC the case was assessed for 5 points. MIB Ki67 index reached more than 80 % malignant cells. Alcian blue was strongly positive in myxoid background. Masson trichrome emphasized fibrillary structure of tumour. Negativity for S100, SMA with strong co-expression of CD34 and vimentin supported the diagnosis of myxofibrosarcoma. Objective: Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumour, mixed connective tissue type (PMTMCT) is a rare, recently defined neoplastic entity. It is characterized by a distinct set of histological features, which often occur in conjunction with the clinical syndrome of oncogenic osteomalacia (OO). Results: We herein present two contrasting cases of PMT, one occurring in the sinonasal region, and the other occurring in bone (proximal femur). In the former case, local effects of the tumour including epistaxis and anosmia dominated the clinical presentation, whilst the latter case presented with refractory bone pain, muscle weakness and occult osteomalacia, the cause of which was only identified after a protracted series of investigations over 2 years. Both tumours showed characteristic histological features of PMTMCT including a monomorphic proliferation of round to ovoid cells, osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells and areas of \"grungy\" basophilic calcifications. There was no evidence of malignant behavior in either of the cases, despite their debilitating clinical manifestations. Conclusion: Thus, these two cases illustrate the importance of recognizing the varied clinical manifestations of PMTMCT, particularly in the context of occult causes of oncogenic osteomalacia. Method: We identified 17 cases of SNS with PAX3 rearrangement without MAML3 involvement and screened for alternate fusion partners using RNAseq, RT-PCR and FISH on paraffin-embedded tissues. Results: Three cases were found to harbor PAX3 exon 7-FOXO1 exon 2 fusion. Two of these cases occurred in female patients (31, 47 years) in the ethmoid sinus and nasal cavity. The third case occurred in a 35-year-old male as two independent masses involving bilateral nasal sinuses -both lesions harbored the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion. The fourth case involved the left oropharynx/skull base of a 47-year-old male and exhibited the PAX3 exon 7-NCOA1 exon 13 fusion. All detected PAX3-FOXO1 are structurally identical to that reported in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS). Conclusion: We report four cases of SNS with PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX3-NCOA1 fusions. As these fusions transcripts have been previously described in ARMS, our findings support the hypothesis that additional mutations and the environment of the cell of origin further modulate the oncogenic effects of PAX3 fusion genes in determining the distinct biologic behaviors of SNS and ARMS.",

Objective: PNET is a rare malignant soft tissue tumour, with variable degrees of neuronal differentiation. The incidence in the abdomen and pelvis, including the retroperitoneum, is about 14 % of peripheral PNETs. Method: A 47-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with nonspecific abdominal pain. CT scan showed an encapsulated mass adjacent to the renal pelvis of the left kidney. The patient underwent left nephrectomy. Macroscopic examination revealed a tumour adjacent to the renal pelvis and a renal calyx of the lower kidney pole. Results: Microscopically the tumour was composed of uniform, small, round neoplastic cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm containing (PAS+, PAS/D -) granules. A wide panel of immunohistochemical markers was performed, from which only S-100 protein, Vimentin, Bcl-2 and Cyclin-D1 were positive, while Ki-67 was estimated at 25 %. It should be noted that CD99 was negative. Based on these results, a differential diagnosis between MPNST, PNET and unclassified round cell sarcoma was discussed and molecular genetic testing was advised. The molecular testing showed the translocation t(11;22). Conclusion: In such cases where morphology and immunohistochemistry is inconclusive and differential diagnosis has to be made between many different neoplasms, molecular methods should be carried out, as they could be the deciding diagnostic factor. Objective: To determine the clinicopathological features and risk grades of GISTs in Sudanese patients. Method: A cross-sectional study conducted on all patients referred to GIST Clinic at Radioisotope Center, Khartoum (January 2014 to February 2015). Only cases with signed informed consent and accessible tissue blocks were included. Non-GIST cases following histological reassessment were excluded. Risk was assigned using integrated risk assessment criteria (based on site, size, mitoses, tumour rupture and clinical metastasis. Results: 25/60 cases fulfilled inclusion criteria; 44 % were males (mean age, 57. 6 \u00b1 13.6; range, 15-75) . Tumour site was stomach in 64 % and small intestine in 24 % of cases. Tumour rupture was present in 28 % (not reported in 44 %) . Metastasis was present initially in 36 % and unknown in 20 %. Tumour size was >2-\u2264 5 cm (4 %), >5-\u2264 10 cm (40 %), >10 (36 %), and not reported in 20 %. Histologic type was spindle in 76 % and epithelioid in 20 %. Mitotic index was <5/5 mm2 in 92 %. Using risk criteria pointed above; 32 % are clinically malignant at presentation, 24 % high risk, 16 % intermediate and 20 % low risk (8 % were not classifiable). Conclusion: Sudanese patients with GIST do present late and most (\u226556 %) correspond to the malignant/high risk category. Objective: Kaposi sarcoma, an AIDS related tumour, is a malignancy associated with Human Herpes Virus type 8 (HHV-8). Kaposi sarcoma is generally multifocal and most commonly involves the skin and mucous membranes, although it can affect virtually any organ. Bone and bone marrow are rarely involved. We will report a case and highlight some clinical-pathologic considerations. Method: We present the case of a 41 years old male with Von Recklinghausen disease, AIDS and visceral Kaposi sarcoma (HHV-8+). A CT scan revealed multiple osteolytic lesions. Bone and bone marrow biopsies were performed. Results: Microscopic examination revealed a vascular proliferation of spindle cells (CD31+, CD34+). Immunohistochemical study was negative for HHV-8. We alerted the clinicians that morphology was suggestive of osseous Kaposi sarcoma despite HHV-8 was negative probably due to immunohistochemistry error. The clinical decision was to start chemotherapy. After six cycles some lesions regressed and others are stable. Conclusion: Osseous Kaposi sarcoma is most often discovered accidently in the context of radiological investigations done for the screening of Kaposi sarcoma-visceral involvement. Little is known on clinical outcome and response to antiretroviral therapy and/or chemotherapy of these lytic lesions. With this report we reinforce that morphology and clinical history are gold standarts. Results: US, X-ray and MRI of the foot revealed a soft tissue nodule in the halux, measuring 1.8 \u00d7 1.7 \u00d7 1.2 cm, which was excised. Histopathologic analysis showed a spindle cell proliferation with a low cellular stroma interposed by myxochondroid areas. There were also variable degrees of hyalinization and multiple flocculent crystaloid deposits. Rare multinucleated giant cells were also observed. A diagnosis of PMT was made. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic. A brief review of the literature showed other 25 cases of PMT reported in the foot, all in adults, with no gender predilection, and with pathological aspects similar to PMTs found elsewhere in the body.",

Histologically some cases of chondromyxoid fibroma overlap with those of chondroblastoma. We present a case of chondromyxoid fibroma involving the proximal phalanx of the toe because of extremely rare location and histologic resemblance to chondroblastoma. Method: A 13-year-old female presented with a history of swelling in the right third toe. Radiograph revealed a 2 \u00d7 1 cm sized expansile and lytic lesion involving the proximal phalanx, which occupied the metadiaphysis extending to the distal epiphysis. There was an endosteal erosion, but no cortical destruction. Ring-shaped mineralization suggested enchondroma radiologically. Curettage was done. Objective: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a slow-growing fibrous tumour of the subcutaneous tissue, frequently seen in proximal extremities and trunk. It rarely metastasizes but has local aggressive behavior. Its presentation in breast is uncommon. Method: Here, a 44-year-old female with a breast mass was presented. Physical examination showed a 8 \u00d7 5,5 centimeter mass with multilobulated bulging from the skin. Radiological examination revealed a 7,5 \u00d7 6,5 centimeter mass with lobulated margins in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast. Due to the large size of the lesion simple mastectomy was performed. Results: In macroscopic examination, skin over the lesion appeared ulcerated and necrotic. Grossly, cut surface showed pale white to tan, well defined, solid mass. Microscopic examination revealed monotonous proliferation of spindle cells with an arrangement of storiform pattern in the collagenous stroma. Mitosis was 2-3/ 10 HPF. Differential diagnosis composed of dermatofibroma, malignant fibrous histioctyoma, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, myofibroblastoma and spindle cell sarcoma. Immunohistochemically tumour cells were positive for CD34 and negative for S100, EMA and SMA. Histopathologically and immunohistochemically the mass was diagnosed as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Objective: Neoplasms with perivascular epithelioid cell differentiation (PEComas) are rare tumours composed of cells supposed to originate from blood vessel walls, having smooth muscle and melanocytic features. There are significant more cases in women, the uterus being frequently involved. Method: We present the case of a 60 years old woman having a large nodular uterine tumour of 19/15/10 cm. Results: The tumour had a fleshy cut surface with necrotic, hemorrhagic and cystic areas. Microscopic examination revealed sheets and trabeculae composed of large, polygonal cells having clear/foamy cytoplasm, nuclear atypia and mitotic activity (8 mitoses/50 high power fields). Some cells were radially arranged around hyalinised blood vessels. Sheets and trabeculae of smaller cells were noted towards the periphery. Tumour necrosis was present. Tumour cells were HMB45 positive, Melan A, SMA and desmin focally positive and S100 negative. Based on gross and microscopic features the final diagnosis of malignant PEComa was rendered. Conclusion: Malignant PEComa represents a rare tumour with an aggressive clinical course. The criteria for malignancy are not widely accepted. Establishing this diagnosis implies exclusion of other more frequent malignancies such as carcinoma, mesothelioma, metastatic melanoma or leyomiosarcoma. Objective: Giant cell tumour (GCT) of bone is a rare benign but aggressive neoplasm that accounts approximately 5 % of all primary bone tumours in adults. It most often occurs at the end of long bones of young adults, with a slight female predominance. We are presenting our experience with the diagnosis and management of 11 cases of GCT of bone in our Center. Method: A retrospective study was conducted of all GCTs managed at Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, in Madrid, from 1997 to 2015. The histopathologic, clinical features, surgical management and follow-up were recorded. Results: On histopathologic examination all cases displayed typical features of GCT. The most common location was the distal femur. The mean age of presentation was 42 years old. There was an even distribution among male and female. Pain was the most common symptom. Most of the cases had extension through the bone into surrounding soft tissue. Most of the cases were treated with curettage and complete en-bloc excision. Only 3 cases had local recurrences during the follow-up period. Conclusion: Our patients developed GCTs at a slightly older age and there was no difference in gender distribution. There were few recurrences, probably related to en-bloc excision of the tumour. Results: Patient's mean age was 30 years (age range: 3-78 years), with a female to male ratio of 26:15. There were 12 patients in the pediatric age group (<16 years). The average diameter of the lesion at presentation was 18.5 mm (range: 2-55 mm). A total of 36 out of 41 (87.8 %) patients presented with solitary lesion, while 5 patient (12.2 %) had two lesions. Most common location in our patient group was head and neck region and second most common location was limbs. The most common clinical presentation was a painless solitary skin lesion which was noticed incidentally. All cases more or less shared the same microscopic features of pilomatrixoma such as basophilic cells, eosinophilic shadow cells, calcification and foreign body type giant cells. Conclusion: Pilomatrixoma is not an uncommon benign lesion. It is more common in female gender, adult age group and at the head and neck region. Objective: Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RF) is a rare disease, typically occuring in middle-aged men, characterized by a fibrotic reaction that replaces normal tissue and affects retroperitoneal organs, especially the urinary tract. The fibroblastic proliferation, usually accompanied by chronic inflammation, starts at the aortic bifurcation. Approximntl twothirds of RF cases are idiopathic. Method: A 61-year-old female presented with flank pain, dysuria and anemia. Echo and CT scan showed lithiasis of the right kidney and a retroperitoneal tumour mass, encasing aortic bifurcation and left ureter. A FNB, performed elsewhere, demonstrated a benign mesenchymal neoplasm, characterized as neurilemoma.",

Microscopically, a fibroblastic proliferation of elongated, slender spindle-shaped cells of uniform appearance and of low mitotic activity, arranged in sweeping bundles and surrounded by abundant hyalinized collagen, was revealed. The cells were immunoreactive to KP1, MAC387, PGM1 and S100 protein. Lymphoplasmacytoid aggregates were also demonstrated. The diagnosis of IRF was confirmed. Conclusion: IRF is a rare reactive process that may be confused with mesenchymal neoplasms especially in small biopsies. The elevated IgG4plasma cells, that have been reported in many cases, may indicate an autoimmune origin, a finding with essential therapeutical implications.",

Method: A 14 years old patient underwent excision of the 14 mm sized soft tissue mass from the medial frontal area. Lesion appeared a few months before excision and after initial growth period it had a static growth. Results: Microscopically, the lesion was intramuscular, poorly defined, consisted of multivacuolated adipocytes in different sizes and shapes and in places spindle cells. There was no marked hyperchromasia and no mitotic figures. Our differential diagnoses were intramuscular lipoma, lipoblastoma and in the end atypical lipomatous tumour. The sample underwent additional FISH analyses which did not revealed amplification of MDM2 gene, a gene specifically rearranged in atypical lipomatous tumour, which is necessary to prevent misdiagnosis. Conclusion: These findings indicate that this tumour was no atypical lipomatous tumour, which is of clinical relevance. We excluded lipoblastoma because lipoblastoma is a rare benign tumour, which occurs primarily in infancy and early childhood and usually arises from the limbs and the trunk, but head and neck involvement is rare. Making a correct diagnosis would be only possible on cytogenetic basis, through the identification of the characteristic PLAG1-HAS2 fusion gene by FISH analysis.",

Method: Report of a 40 year old female patient with a painless, slow growing palpable mass of the right knee. A core needle biopsy, followed by radical resection and 1 year later, amputation of the right lower extremity due to bone metastasis were performed. Results: Histologically, the tumour (maximal diameter 9 cm.) had an organoid pattern of growth, consisting of uniform nests separated by delicate partitions of connective tissue, in a well vascularized background. The tumour cells were polygonal, with distinct cytoplasmic borders, eosinophilic or finely granular cytoplasm and big, rounded nuclei with prominent nucleoli. PAS-diastase histochemical stain accentuated the presence of intracytoplasmic rhomboid crystalline inclusions.

            "text": "Objective: Histopathological examination of a surgically resected, subcutaneous, painless mass located on the plantar side of the foot of a 14 year old female patient. Method: Standard histochemical and immunohistochemical staining methods. Results: Microscopic examination showed infiltrative fibroblast growth surrounded with dense collagen stroma and multiple foci of chondroid differentiation with calcification. The lesion showed diffuse positivity for vimentin and was negative for S-100. Conclusion: Calcyfying aponeurotic fibroma is a rare, benign, soft tissue tumour with predilection for forming in the hands and feet of adolescent children. Peak incidence is between the age of 8 to 14, with a 70 % male predominance. Two primary sites of growth are the hands and the feet, most commonly, the palm and the fingers of the hand. Plantar side of the foot is a less common site. Infiltrative nature of growth accounts for a high rate of local recurrence. Malignant alteration is uncommon, and only a few cases of malignant transformation have been reported. Objective: Liposarcoma as a group, are the most common soft tissue sarcoma of adults and usually arise in the deep soft tissues of the extremities or the retroperitoneum. Primary mediastinal liposarcomas are rare, and are thought to represent <1 % of all mediastinal tumours. Because of its low incidence it is unclear whether this sarcoma represents a highgrade variant of myxoid liposarcoma, a distinct variant of myxoid liposarcoma or an unique form of liposarcoma. Method: Here we describe a 28-year-old man presenting with acute dyspnea and pleural pain. Radiological imaging revealed a large and circumscribed left mediastinal mass. Surgical excision was performed with the previous diagnosis of celomic cyst. Results: Histologically, consists of pleomorphic tumour cells with severe cytological atypia and increased mitotic activity in a myxoid matrix with a delicate plexiform capillary network, and scattered lipoblasts. FISH techniques using LSI FUS (16p11) Break apart, LSI CEP 12/MDM2 and LSI EWSR1 (22q12) y DDIT3 (12q13) Break Apart probes were performed. Conclusion: Pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma usually occurs in young patient and is a very rare and still poorly understood entity. A consensus is yet to be made on the precise classification and terminology of this subtype of aggressive liposarcoma, especially in children and young adults. Objective: Solitary fibrous tumours (SFT) are rare spindle cell neoplasms, most commonly arising from the pleura. The aim of the present paper is to present a difficult case to diagnose and to manage case as SFT. Method: The patient, a 48 years-old woman, was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea, cough and fatigue. The imagistic investigation revealed metastatic lung and liver nodules and a retroperitoneal mass of 8.7/7 cm. Her medical history mentioned a retroperitoneal tumour back in 1998. Results: One of the metastatic nodules from the lung was biopsied and the diagnosis established in various laboratory from Romania and abroad were: benign heterotopic lesion, spindle cell carcinoid, neuroendocrine intermediate grade tumour, sarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, SFT. The tumour cells were positive for NSE and the serum level of NSE was elevated (145 ng/ml). On the basis of the IHC profile the diagnosis of SFT was established. Following chemotherapy the serum level of NSE decreased to 6.63 ng/ml but brain metastases appeared. The patient refused another chemotherapeutic scheme and died 3 years later. Conclusion: SFT is a rare and challenging tumour in the term of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. It can behave aggressively even in the absence of histological signs of malignancy as illustrated by the present case. Objective: Hibernoma is a benign tumour arises from brown fat tissue. Method: We present 3 cases of hibernomas which were localzed at back. Results: Two was female and one was male. Median age was 27 (31, 30 and 22 years old). Lobulated lesion was composed an admixture of mature adipocytes and cells characterized by a small, central nuclei and a finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Lobules of adipocytes, capillaries, nerves and connective tissue. Adipocytes are smaller (25-40 microns) than usual in white fat, are polygonal with acidophilic multivacuolated and granular cytoplasm and central spherical nucleus with fine indentations. Each of these tumours overexpressed CD 68 and p53 protein by immunohistochemistry. CD 34 was negative. Hibernomas are rare, asymptomatic, benign tumours that arise mostly in adults from the remnants of fetal brown adipose tissue, and usually affect muscle and subcutaneous tissue. A review of the literature highlights recent advances that may help confirm the diagnosis and explain the biology of these rare tumours. Conclusion: We suggest that hybernomas should be included among the differential diagnosis in every growing mass, especially if the detection of the tumour is a fortuitous coincidence in an asymptomatic patient. Objective: Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is an entity with a wide clinical and morphologic spectrum. Recently some lesions with mixed features of congenital infantile fibrosarcoma (CIFS) and IM called composite infantile myofibromatosis (COIM) have been described. Method: A 6-day-old girl with a 6 cm forearm mass in the deep soft tissue and bone nodules, with no visceral involvement. Results: Microscopic findings showed a mesenchymal proliferation where two distinct morphologic features were observed. The mayor part revealed plump, spindle-shaped cells resembling myofibroblasts arranged in an irregular spiral pattern. Around these leiomyoma-like areas, there were, focally, less well differentiated rounded cells in a vascular hemangiopericytoma-like pattern, with no evidence of intravascular projections. The mitotic rate ranged from 5 to 15 per 10 high-power fields. Inmunohistochemically, the cells were inmunoreactive for vimentin, muscle-specific actin (HHF35) and alfa actin. CD34 and calponin was weakly positive and S100 negative. The tumour was diagnosed as IM. Conclusion: IM may resemble CIFS and infantile hemangiopericytoma, so it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of tumours in early infancy, despite its low frequency. Molecular analysis for the characteristic translocation between chromosomes 12 and 15 in CIFS will contribute to distinguish among these entities. Objective: The progression of synovial chondromatosis to chondrosarcoma is very rare. We describe a case who presented with synovial chondromatosis and progression to synovial chondrosarcoma. Method: A 47-year-old man presented with a large, painful mass in left knee. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed synovial thickening with effusion and an destructively growing lesion involving the distal femur and tibia. The clinical and radiological impression was that of malignant transformation of a recurrent synovial chondromatosis. Bone biopsy specimens suggested a grade 1, focal grade II chondrosarcoma. The patient was treated with a limb-saving, wide resection of the knee region. Results: The specimen showed a 12 cm, lobulated cartilaginous tumour located in the joint space, infiltrating the articular surface of distal femur, proximal tibia and surrounding soft tissue. Histological sections confirmed the diagnosis of a grade 1 chondrosarcoma. The resection margins were free. Conclusion: Chondrosarcoma of the synovium is extremely rare. It may arise de novo of the synovium or preexisting synovial chondromatosis may undergo malignant transformation. Distinction between chondromatosis and its progression to low grade chondrosarcoma is difficult at histological level, and must involve clinical and radiographical data. We interpret this case synovial chondromatosis with transformation to chondrosarcoma. Objective: Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) of tendons and aponeuroses, is a rare melanin producing soft tissue sarcoma, that usually presents in the distal lower extremities of young adults, frequently attached to tendons or aponeuroses. The aim of this report is to present the histopathological aspects of two cases of clear cell sarcoma of tendon sheath. Method: Case 1: A 20-year-old man presented with a mass on left thigh region. MRI results showed 10 cm contrast enhancing mass. Case 2: A 45-year-old man presented with a large, painful mass on the right knee of several weeks duration. MRI showed an expanding, 6 cm mass in lateral side of the right knee. Results: In both cases, microscopically the tumours were composed of nests and fascicles of epithelioid cells, surrounded by a fibrocollagenous tissue continiuous with the adjacent tendons. The tumoural cells have indistinct cell borders, round to ovoid vesicular nuclei with prominent basophilic nucleoli and clear or pale cytoplasm. By immunohistochemistry, S100, MelanA, HMB45 was positive. Objective: DTF and LGFMS may have similar clinicopathological features but their outcome is completely different. The aim of our study is to differentiate these lesions based on immunohistochemical profile. Method: We present two cases of a 33 years-old and, respectively, 28 years-old women, each of them with an abdominal wall mass. Both lesions were surgically removed with marginal type excision. They were poorly circumscribed, firm, white on cut surface, measuring 15 cm and, respectively, 8 cm. On routine staining, both lesions were diagnosed as fibromatosis. The immuhistochemical panel that we used in both cases was: EMA, SMA, Desmin, Beta-catenin, Ki-67. Results: Histologically, both lesions showed a proliferation of bland spindle cells with no mitotic figures, embedded in a collagenous background, with arcades of small blood vessels in the first case, and ectatic blood vessels, in the second one. Based on immunohistochemical profiles, first lesion was diagnosed as FMLGS (\u03b2-catenin negative, SMA and Desmin focally positive, EMA positive, Ki-67 positive 3-5 %), and second lesion, as DTF (\u03b2-catenin positive; SMA focally positive, Desmin and EMA negative; Ki-67<1 %). Conclusion: Although LGFMS and DTF have similar site of involvement and epidemiological, clinical, macroscopic, histological features, these tumours should be properly diagnosed, given the metastatic potential of LGFMS. Objective: In this study, we examined 5 cases diagnosed as benign lipomatous tumours (3 pleomorphic lipomas and 2 lipoblastomas) showing atypical morphological features. Method: 3 pleomorphic lipomas and 2 lipoblastomas were reviewed. Immunohistochemically, p16 (BD Pharmingen, 1:25), CD34 (Novocastra, 1:100), MDM2 (Neomarkers 1:150) and CDK4 (Neomarkers 1:150) were performed using Leica Bond automated system in all cases, MDM2 FISH (Zytovision) was performed in 2 pleomorphic lipomas and 2 lipoblastomas. Results: Of the 3 pleomorphic lipomas, 2 were females and 1 was male, with a mean age of 46, and locations were cheek, back and gluteal region. One year old male and 2 years old female lipoblastomas were located at head and neck region. Atypical mitoses were detected in all cases of the pleomorphic lipoma. Additionally, hypercellularity and scattered lipoblasts were encountered in 15 cm sized pleomorphic lipoma located at back. One lipoblastoma revealed overt vascular invasion and the other showed ulceration and scattered MDM2 positive atypical cells with irregular nuclear membranes. Immunohistochemically, both MDM2 and CDK4 were negative in all pleomorphic lipomas. CD34 and P16 was diffusely positive in all pleomorphic lipomas and one lipoblastoma. No amplification was observed in studied cases by MDM2 FISH. Complete resection was applied to all cases and no recurrence or metastasis during follow-up periods ranging from 2 to 14 months.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Some benign lipomatous tumours demonstrate atypical morphological features suspicious for malignancy, such as vascular invasion and atypical mitosis that may lead to misdiagnosis of sarcoma in an otherwise benign lipomatous tumour. More cases and longer clinical follow-up are needed in order to reveal the nature of these cases. Objective: We aim to study p16 immunohistochemical expression in adipocytic tumours either benign or malignant. Method: 34 specimens, including 17 liposarcomas (LPS) and 17 benign adipous tumours (BAT), were studied. LPS were well-differentiated in 17.6 %, myxo\u00efd in 64.7 % and pleomorphic in 17. 6 %. BAT included lipomas (58.8 %) , angiolipoma (35.2 %) and lipomatosis (5.8 %). P16 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Positivity was scored as 1+ (1-10 % focal nuclear staining), 2+ (11-50 % multifocal nuclear staining), 3+ (>50 % diffuse nuclear staining). Absence of nuclear staining, cytoplasmic or membrane staining were considered as negative. Results: 23.5 % of BAT were p16 negative, 70.5 % were scored 1+, 6 % were 2+ and none was 3+. 6 % of LPS were p16 negative, 17.5 % were scored 1+, 6 % were 2+ and 70.5 % were 3+. 3+ positivity was seen in only LPS. 20 % of negative staining was seen in LPS. Conclusion: Our study showed that diffuse p16 immunostaining in adipocytic tumours is highly suggestive of LPS. Its negativity cannot exclude malignancy. P16 may be used in combination with other immunohistochemical stain such as CDK4 and MDM2 to increase the sensitivity and the specificity in resolving the differential diagnosis. An 11-year old girl was operated because of fronto-parietal mass lesion by craniotomy. Because of possibility of metastasis the patient has to be followed up for long period. Method: Neurological examination revealed 4/5 monoparesia in the right arm. MR imaging revealed a solitary well-defined lobulated mass lesion of left frontal lobe that was located in the subcortical white matter and extending to the deep white matter. Results: On pathological examination, the tumour was showing alveolar nesting pattern with tumour cells containing abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and discohesive nature. There were PAS-positive and diastaseresistant rod shaped multiple crystalline materials in the cytoplasm of some tumour cells and reticulin (silver) framework surrounding the tumour nests. Tumour cells were showing focal immunoreactivity with GFAP and no immunoreactivity with S100 protein. These findings revealed alveolar soft sarcoma. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth case of primary intracranial ASPS without a demonstrable lesion elsewhere. Objective: Adenolipoma, which is a rare form of lipoma, is first described by Hitchcock et al. and characterized by eccrine sweat glands between mature adipose cells. Adenolipoma usually occurs in the dermis or the subcutaneous tissue. Method: 48-years old male patient was admitted to our hospital with complaint of a neck mass. Ultrasonography report was highly echogenic, regularly contoured solid lesion which was 2,5 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2,5 cm in diameter and these signs were compatible with lipoma or fibrolipoma. Macroscopically material was 6 gr in weight, had irregular contours and the cut surface was yellow. Microscopically we identified mature adipose tissue arranged in a lobulated pattern and there were eccrine gland and ductal structures entrapped in this adipose tissue. Conclusion: Adenolipoma is a very rare benign tumour. Usual site for adenolipoma is thigh and there is only one more report of adenolipoma on the neck region. Since it is a very rare localization for adenolipoma it must be kept in mind while investigating head and neck region lipomatous lesions.",

            "text": "Objective: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) is an uncommon tumour of vascular origin that may develop in the soft tissue, bone, lung, brain, liver and stomach. Primary hepatic EH is rare. It is frequently seen in middle-aged women. We report a case of a man who was found to have multipl hepatic masses in the all segments of the liver. Method: A 45-year-old male patient presented with abdominal pain. Imaging studies showed multiple nodules in the liver and had features suggest a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. Ultrasonography guided needle core biopsy from the voluminous nod\u00fcle (segment VIII, diameter: 12 \u00d7 10 mm) was taken. Results: Microscopically, the section showed polygonal epithelioid tumour cells with intracytoplasmic vacuoles, vesicular to hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumour cells to be strongly and diffusely positive for CD34, factor VIII, vimentin. The tumour cells were negative for CEA, SMA and S-100. Therefore, a final histologic diagnosis of hepatic EH was made. Liver transplantation was performed 1.5 months later. At the last follow-up (33 months after diagnosis), the patient appeared well with no complaint or recurrence diagnosed on the liver. Conclusion: In case of liver localization, EH presents as multiple hepatic nodules. Liver transplantation appears to be the only hope for patients with hepatic EH because of the multifocality of the tumour. Partial resection of the liver is possible for the localized tumour with good results. Objective: To study the characteristics of blood supply of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with varying degrees of histological differentiation without liver cirrhosis. Method: Were examined 19 patients (12 men and 7 women aged 18-72 years) with HCC: well differentiated (WD) (n = 6), moderately differentiated (MD) (n = 10) and poorly differentiated (PD) (n = 3) HCC. In preoperative stage was performed multislice computed tomography (MSCT). Calculated CT-exponent of tumour vascularization counting and the ratio of the portal and arterial blood. Results: Maximum values of the degree of vascularization installed in WDHCC tissue, minimum -PDHCC. The largest index of blood flow to tumours by the hepatic artery-80,7 %, of the total flow of blood (portal-19, 3 %), is set to PDHCC. The level of inflow of arterial blood into the MDHCC less the values of the PD version, and was 67,6 % of the total (portal-32,4 %). Minimum parameters of inflow of arterial blood were observed in the WDHCC-41,9 % (portal-58.1 %) of the total tumour blood flow. Conclusion: Conducting MSCT with bolus contrast allows to estimate the degree of vascularization liver tissue and HCC nodes. Increasing the share of inflow of arterial blood and reducing the share of the venous inflow occurred with decreasing degree of histological differentiation. Objective: Nowadays, CD4 T-helper cells are divided into four major subsets based on their expression profile of transcription factors and secreted cytokines: Th1, Th2, Th17 and Tregs. IL-17 promotes tumour progression and Tregs inhibit activation and differentiation of CD4+ CD25-or CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Our aim was to evaluate the number of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+, CD56+/CD57+, FoxP3 cells and IL-17 cells in primary liver tumours and liver metastases. The tissue expression of TGF-beta, IL-10 and IL-17 was measured. Method: Immunohistochemical investigation was done: liver metastases from primary colorectal cancer (n = 19); hepatocelular carcinomas (n = 18); haemangiomas (n = 5). Results: In tumour stroma the numbers of FoxP3+ and IL-17+ cells, were increased and CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were decreased as compared to peritumoral compartment. Concerning the expression of CD56/CD57 cells it was decreased in peritumoral tissue as compared to haemangioma patients. The expression of IL-17 was lower than that of TGF-beta and IL-10 in tumour and immune cells. Wednesday, 9 September 2015, 09.30-10.30, Restaurant PS-16 Poster Session Digestive Diseases Pathology III: Liver / Biliary analysis by Kaplan-Meier analysis disclosed that tumour number, maximum tumour size, gross type, Edmondson-Steiner(ES) nuclear grade, angioinvasion, pT stage, Milan criteria (p < 0.001), UCSF criteria (all p < 0.001), and positive expression of CK19 (p = 0.006) were predictors of tumour recurrence. A multivariate analysis, tumour number (p = 0.028), maximum tumour size (p < 0.001) and angioinvasion (p = 0.005) were independent predictors of tumour recurrence. Conclusion: TPL may have protective effect for late recurrence of pT1-2 HCCs, compared with non-TPL group and prognostic factors for recurrence were similar with previously well-known prognostic factors of HCCs.",

            "text": "Objective: In recent years there appeared information about different metaplastic changes in gallbladder associated with chronic calculous cholecystitis. These were pseudopyloric metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia with or without dysplasia. The aim of our study was to assesse the endocrine cell hyperplasia in association with these types of metaplasia. Method: Surgical biopsy samples collected from 18 patients with calculous cholecystitis with metaplasia and from 9 patients with chronic cholecystitis without metaplasia were investigated. Immunohistochemical reaction were done with antibodies against chromogranin A, serotonin, gastrin, somatostatin and synaptophysin. Results: It was found that endocrine cells positive for chromogranin A, serotonin, gastrin, somatostatin and synaptophysin were increased significantly in number (\u03c7 = 9.45, \u0440 = 0.002; \u03c7 = 6.67, \u0440 = 0.009; \u03c7 = 8.0, \u0440 = 0.005; \u03c7 = 9.45, \u0440 = 0.002; \u03c7 = 8.0, \u0440 = 0.005, respectively ) in most cases with metaplasia. It was detected that pseudopyloric glands prevailed in the patients with metaplasia. Conclusion: In conclusion we may stete that endocrine cell hyperplasia was associated with metaplastic changes in gallbladder. Objective: Signet ring cell degeneration (SRCP) is a phenomenon of epithelial cells to round up and shape making signet ring forms considered to be degenerative change. It is emphasized that there is a high risk of overdiagnosis of signet ring cell adenocarcinoma in same locations. The precise mechanism for their production is still unclear, but it seems to be related to ischemia, necrosis, ulceration or provoked by inflammatory process. Method: Routine histological, histochemical (alcian blue, PAS) and ancillary immunohistochemical p53 ) examination were done. Results: We present a case of 76-year-old male patient who had chronic perforated pyloric ulcer and had cholecystectomy due to prominent surrounding peritonitis. Besides chronic cholecystitis, mucosa showed almost completely SRCD accompanied by papillary hyperplasia with focal low grade dysplasia. Although almost all epithelial cells expressed strong membranous immunopositivity for E-cadherin, some group of significantly atypical dysplastic epithelial cells showed high Ki-67 and p53 index associated with SRCD. Conclusion: This rare and peculiar SRCD phenomenon is not always mucosal degeneration of non-neoplastic cells and could be associated with dysplasia. Objective: Gallbladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract, accounting for 80-95 % of biliary tract cancers. This tumour is a highly lethal disease with an overall 5-year survival of less than 5 % and mean survival less than 6 months. The most common type of gallbladder cancer is adenocarcinoma, and the incidence of adenosquamous carcinoma, associated with worse prognosis is rare. Method: A 81-year-old female patient presented to our general surgery outpatient clinic with abdominal pain. The physical examination revealed tenderness on palpation in the right upper quadrant. Abdominal ultrasound examination showed hydropic swelling of the gallbladder. She underwent gallbladder resection with regional lymphadenectomy. Pathology analysis revealed a 10,5-cm pT3N1adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder. Results: Patients with adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder most commonly showed a large mass replacing the gallbladder fossa. The bulky tumour is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage with frequent invasion of the adjacent organs, such as the liver, extra hepatic bile ducts, duodenum, stomach, colon and pancreas. Conclusion: Here, we present a rarely seen case of gallbladder adenosquamous carcinoma.Although this type gallbladder carcinoma had a tendency for liver invasion and poor outcome, better survival can be obtained by performing curative resection. Key Words: Adenosquamous carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, neoplasm. Objective: Luschka ducts (LD) of the gallbladder (GB) are rare congenital lesions, comprising varied lesion subtypes. There are few recent reports in adult patients. We aimed to report the characteristics of 17 cases of gallbladder LD as diagnosed on cholecystectomy specimens. Method: The surgically resected GBs were analyzed for GB lesions and LD features (length, cystic dilatation, nodular pattern, epithelial mucosecretion and atypia, inflammation, and cytokeratin 20 and ROS1 immunohistochemisties). These data were analyzed with regard to the main clinical characteristics. Results: The age varied between 24 and 86 years (median, 61 years) and, the gender ratio was 7:10 (female: male). The diagnosis was cholecystitis, acute (10) or chronic (7). 3 GB were alithiasic. GB adenocarcinoma was associated in one of the acute cholecystitis cases. The LDs were subserosal (16) or at the resection site (4, both in 3 cases). LD length varied between <1 and 25 mm. A nodular pattern was seen in 4 cases. Epithelial mucosecretion occurred in 5 cases, regenerative atypia in 6. Cystic dilatation was seen in 3 cases. Polymorphous peri-LD inflammation was more frequently mild (9 versus 4 with moderate or severe inflammation; 3 cases lacked inflammation). ROS1 and cytokeratin 20 were negative in the case with a history of colon adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that LD-complexes may harbor varied aspects, from duct-like, inframilimetric or cystic, to nodular complexes, being preferentially located subserosally. Epithelial atypia warrants ROS1 and cytokeratin 20 immunohistochemistries, helpful in the differential diagnosis with adenocarcinoma. Objective: Liver biopsy is the gold-standard method to assess the severity of liver damage, but the invasive nature of this method limits its usage. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether complete blood count (CBC) parameters such as mean platelet volume (MPV) would be useful in predicting liver histological activity in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Method: 136 patients with chronic active hepatitis B based on liver biopsy were enrolled retrospectively into the study. MPV, platelet distribution width (PDW) and platelet count were compared according to liver biopsy findings such as histological activity index (Knodell score). Results: We demonstrated that MPVand PDW were significantly increased and platelet count was significantly decreased in moderately active hepatitis group compared with mildly and minimally active group (p = 0.002, p = 0.03, p = 0.006, respectively). According to treatment cut-off point of histological activity index in mildly active group, significant difference was found between MPV and PDW levels (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04). Conclusion: We suggest that MPV might help the treatment decision before biopsy or during follow up, especially in mildly active CHB and it can be used as a new marker that can be useful to determine the activity of CHB. Objective: The diagnosis of amyloidosis depends on the histologic demonstration of amyloid deposits in tissues. The most common sites biopsied are the kidney, rectal or gingival tissues in patients suspected of having systemic amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates can also be diagnostic. Despite the fact that a colon biopsy which took place a few months earlier was negative (Congo Red -), the first diagnosis of our patient's condition was made after a liver biopsy. Method: A liver FNB was received from a 39-year-old woman admitted for chronic diarrhea, vomiting, hepatomegaly and ascites. Results: Histologically, although single cell and trabecular hepatocellular arrangement was retained, there was total sinusoidal extinction by an acellular homogeneous eosinophilic material filling the sinusoids. Amyloidosis was obvious, confirmed by a positive Congo Red stain and further histochemical and immunochemical techniques. Conclusion: Amyloid is present in more than 90 % of rectal and subcutaneous fat biopsies in systemic AA or AL amyloidosis. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of amyloidosis due to the unavoidable problem of sampling error and the variability of amyloid deposition. Despite the initial diagnosis of collagenous colitis after rectal biopsy in our patient, it was liver biopsy which finally disclosed amyloidosis as the main source of systemic distress. Objective: Our study aimed to clarify the association between XRCC1-Arg399Gln, XRCC3-Thr241Met, and XRCC3-5\u2032UTR polymorphism and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) risk and to find a link between their expression and the clinical outcome of HCC. Method: A total of 50 cases with HCC were collected. These three genetic variants (XRCC1-Arg399Gln, XRCC3-Thr241Met and XRCC3-5\u2032UTR) were genotyped by pyrosequencing method. All analyses were performed using the MedCalc statistical package. Results: Statistical analysis results did not identified a causal next to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), polymorphic genotypes variants, and clinicopathological characteristics in analyzed cases. Survival correlations reflected the possible prognosis value only for XRCC3-5\u2032 UTR(P = 0.003) in HCC, considering that wild-type gene was associated to a statistically significant longer survival compared to SNP. Conclusion: Our data interpretation supports the assumption that DNA repair genes polymorphism vulnerable against numerous injuries with genotoxic effect may be incriminated in initiation of primary HCC, without a demonstrable direct connection between polymorphous genotype and HCC. HCC initiation and evolution modality reveals a multifactorial mechanism including genetic polymorphism which does not possess a crucial role. Objective: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) that settle on gallbladder means less than 1 % of all gastrointestinal tract NETs and less than 5 % of all gallbladder carcinomas. It occurs more frecuently in females and reaches its highest incidence in the seventh decade of life. Method: Preoperative diagnosis is exceptional and it takes place in less than 20 % of cases. It is clinically insidious and indistinguishable from the symptoms associated with choledocholithiasis. Results: We present a 70-year-old patient who had previously consulted because epigastric pain, vomiting and heartburn. Abdominal CT showed a large tumour mass occupying the light of the gallbladder. Intraoperative biopsy showed a poorly differentiated malignant tumour. Subsequently, we recieved a tumoural gallbladder. Microscopically we appreciated an infiltrating neoplasia with a nested pattern, consisting of small cells with hyperchromatic nucleus and nuclear molding. Furthermore moderately differentiated glandular structures with poorly differentiated foci were seen. Immunohistochemically, small and hyperchromatic cells were positive for synaptophysin, enolase and CD56, while the glandular structures were positives for CK7 and 19. Ki67 was around 90 %. Conclusion: NETs of the gallbladder are extremely rare and often occur with other concomitant carcinoma. Patient prognosis is poor in any case, but early detection with complete resection may improve the prognosis. Method: Routine histological and immunohistochemical examination and reevaluation of clinical data on age, sex, radiological features, size, etiology (HBV, HCV, alcohol) and cirrhosis. Results: In last three years we diagnosed three cases of HCC-CC-SCF among eight HCC-CC. Well defined hepatic mass sometimes showed satellites, but US/CT/MR features with irregular \"peripheral enhancement\" in some cases were interpreted as focal nodular hyperplasia or vascular lesions. No significant differences were found between HCC-CC-SCF and HCC-CC in respect to clinical data. Although histologically and immunohistochemically variable, we concluded one case as typical and two cases as cholangiolocellular type with diffuse immunoexpression of CAM5.2, canalicular and/or cytoplasmic pCEA and N-cadherin and at least focal immunopositivity for CK7, CK19, Hep-Par1 and NCAM/CD56, but consistently negative for CK20, vimentin and CDX-2. Objective: Heterotopias of various tissues have been described in the gallbladder. The most common ones include tissue of pancreas, intestines, liver, adrenal and thyroid gland and gastric mucosa. Patients are usually asymptomatic; in rare cases patients present with billiary type symptoms. Heterotopias most often are incidental finding in cholecystectomy specimens. Method: A 39-years old Caucasian presented with biliary colic and nausea. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness. Abdominal multislice computed tomography (MSCT) was preformed, hyperdense area in the infundibulum of the gallbladder, measuring 2 cm in the greatest diameter was found. Laparascopic cholecystectomy was preformed. Results: On gross examination gallbladder measured 6 \u00d7 2 cm with polypoid mass measuring 2 \u00d7 1,5 \u00d7 1 cm in the gallbladder neck. Microscopic analysis revealed polypoid heterotopic gastric mucosa, containing pyloric and fundic type glands with parietal cells. Few glands were cystically dilated and lined with columnar mucinous epithelium with foci of intestinal metaplasia and low grade foveolar dysplasia. Surrounding lamina propria was edematous with lymphocytic infiltrate. Remaining of the gallbladder had normal histologic apperence. Conclusion: Heterotopic gastric mucosa in the gallbladder is rare entity. Because it can result in acute and chronic cholecystitis as well as carcinoma it should be taken into consideration during gallbladder specimen examination.",

Imaging studies revealed a homogeneous 4 cm tumour in the pancreatic head, well-delimited, but not encapsulated, mainly solid, with a cystic component. Due to the clinical suspicion for cystadenocarcinoma pancreatectomy was performed. Results: Histologically, the tumour was composed of spindle cells with regular nuclei, separated by large amount of collagen fibers and myxoid tissue. No necrosis was found and mitotic activity was 1-2 mitoses in 10 HPFs. The cystic component was due to retention cysts and ductal dilatation. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that tumour cells were positive for Beta-catenin, CD34, Vimentin, CD99, Actin, bcl-2 and negative for S-100, CK, EMA and Desmin. Proliferative index on Ki-67 staining was below 2 %. Diagnosis of benign solitary desmoid tumour was made. Conclusion: There is limited data regarding biological behavior of DTs with extra-pleural localization, because they are quite rare tumours. Diagnosis of malignancy is based on nuclear atypia, cellularity, necrosis, high Ki-67, expression on p53, 4 mitoses in 10 HPFs and tumour larger than 10 cm.",

HCC is one of the most common malignant tumours that carry a poor prognosis. To improve the long-term outlook for HCC, an accurate prognosis is important. We sought to examine immunohistochemical expressions of proliferative Ki67 and Bcl-2 apoptotic marker and their potential role as prognostic factors in HCV patients. Method: Ninety formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC receiving needle liver biopsy were investigated immunochistochemically for the expression of Ki67 and Bcl-2 and correlated with age and Knodell index. Results: Ki67 and Bcl-2 expression was statistically significantly higher in HCC and cirrhosis compared with chronic hepatitis (p < 0,001). Knodell index was statistically positive correlated with age (p < 0,05). Conclusion: These data suggest that HCV infection induces increased and abnormal hepatocyte proliferation which might be related to the increased risk of HCC in patients with HCV-related liver damage. High Ki67 and Bcl-2 expression might be associated with poor survival in patients with HCC.",

            "text": "The proliferative rate of hepatic adenomas versus well differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas using Ki-67 immunohistochemistry \"hot spot\" digital analysis Objective: To investigate the utility of digital protocols for Ki-67 immunohistochemistry quantitative analysis (\"hot spot\" method) in the setting of well differentiated hepatocellular neoplasms. Method: Resection cases of typical hepatic adenomas (HAs) (n = 40), atypical HAs (n = 9), and WD HCCs (n = 56), diagnosed between 1997 and 2014, were selected (re-reviewed by 3 GI pathologists). HAs were further classified by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against liver fatty acid binding protein [LFABP] , glutamine synthetase [GS], B-catenin, hepatic serum amyloid [SAA] , and C-reactive protein [CRP] ). Ki-67 proliferative index by IHC was evaluated in all cases by digital analysis using a standardized neuroendocrine tumour \"hot spot\" protocol ( Fig. 1) . Results: The proliferative rate of HAs (typical, median 1.2 % [range 0-7.4 %] and atypical, median 1. 0 % [range 0.3-3 %] ) was significantly lower than that of WD HCCs (median 4.5 %, range 0-50 %) (P < 0.0001). Only a few (6 %) of the adenomas (all inflammatory/telangiectatic type) had proliferative rates higher than 4 %, compared to most (51 %) of WD HCCs. Conclusion: Ki-67 is a potentially useful adjunct marker in the evaluation of WD hepatocellular neoplasms, as \"hot spot\" proliferative rates >4 % are uncommon in HAs but frequent in WD HCCs. Objective: Eosinophilic cholecystitis (EC) is a very rare form of cholecystitis and is characterized histologically by a marked infiltrate composed predominantly eosinophils. Its prevalance is 0.25-6.4 %. Method: We report four cases which were diagnosed as EC. Results: Our cases were two females (36 and 47-years-old) and 2 males (47 and 54-years-old). All cases admitted with abdominal pain. One of them had high percentege in neutrophils in hemogram. Aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels were high in 2 of 4 patients. These enzymes were normal in one patient. Three of four cases had gallstones in ultrasongraphic and gross examination while one of them had biliary mud. On gross examination, the gall bladders' lengths were 7.5-12 cm and wall thickness' were 2-7 mm. Histopathologically; dense infiltrates composed of eosinophils were seen. Retrospective analysis of case histories did not reveal any known etiology. Conclusion: Histopathologically the patients with acalculous cholecystitis have a higher percentage of eosinophils than the patients with gallstones. In contrast, three of our four patients had gallstones. EC can be associated with hypereosinophilic syndrome, parasitic infestations, few herbal medicines and certain drugs. Only one of our patients had used Paliperidon which has no defiened relationship with EC yet. Objective: To study collagens IV and VI expression in pancreas at CP. Method: Using morphological, immunohistochemical, morphometric methods, we investigated the pancreas specimens of 28 patients with CP who underwent duodenum saving resection of the pancreas head. Control group included 7 pancreas head specimens of people, died due to accident and having no pathology of pancreas. Statistic analysis included T-test. All p value \u2264 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Our research showed that collagen IV localized in basements membranes of vessels and ducts, acinar cells. Expression was higher in pancreas samples at CP. Collagen VI localized in cytoplasm of acinar cells and duct's epithelium. Count of positive cells and total positive area were more than 2-fold increasing in pancreatic tissue of patient with CP. The results of the markers expression are displayed in Table. Conclusion: Histological examination showed collagen IV, VI expression changes statistically significant in pancreas samples at CP. The revealed changes expression connected with progressive degenerative changes and fibrosis. Objective: Nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) is an infrequent morphologic pattern included within Non-Cirrhotic Idiopathic Portal Hypertension (NCPH). It is characterized by diffuse micronodular transformation of the hepatic parenchyma without fibrous septa. Association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely infrequent. Method: We describe the clinicopathological features of a patient diagnosed of NCPH and hepatocarcinoma submitted to liver transplantation. Results: 40 year old man categorized as NCPH presented with oesophageal variceal bleeding in 2001 without aetiological factors for chronic hepatic disease (negativity for hepatotropic viruses, autoimmunity). Liver biopsy showed no cirrhosis. Signs of portal hypertension without vascular disease on abdominal CT and normal hepatic venous pressure gradient were found. In 2014, presented a HCC and was proposed for liver transplantation (2015) . Grossly the liver showed a dysmorphic, macronodular parenchyma. Histopathologic findings were: NRH without cirrhosis, myointimal fibrosis of a venous structure of the hepatic hilum, focal nodular hyperplasia (2 \u00d7 1 cm) in segment V-VIII and grade 2/4 HCC (4 \u00d7 3.7 cm). Conclusion: This case highlights NRH as a morphological pattern occurring in the setting of NCPH and its difficult diagnosis in liver biopsy. Assessing the utility of screening for HCC in these patients should be considered due to the possible pathogenic relationship between NRH and HCC, despite being non-cirrhotic.",

Autopsy results show mottled and congestive liver, haphazard extensive necrosis surrounded by congestive areas and, nuclear eosinophilic inclusions. Immunohistochemistry and PCR were consistent with HSV-I liver infection. Bibliographic and data review revealed a lack of liver biopsy procedures as a diagnostic method. Conclusion: The fatal outcome of this two events show the urgency to make an early diagnostic and to take into account an HSV-I hepatitis as a cause of fulminant hepatic failure in healthy patients. It remains a challenge the utility of early liver biopsy as a diagnostic tool since data related to this method in such patients are not reasonably studied. Objective: The majority of hepatocellular carcinomas arise in background chronic liver disease, particulary cirrosis. The pathogenesis of noncirrhotic hepatocellular carcinomas remains unclear. While malignant transformation reportedly occurs in <15 %of hepatocellular adenoma, the prevalence of noncirrhotic hepatocellular carcinomas arising from a preexisting adenoma is a challenge to study. Method: We describe the case of a 68 year old woman with a Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension, Dyslipidemia, sleep apnea and kidney lithiasis, whom a routing monitoring finds out a large single liver tumour. Results: Microscopically, the tumour was composed of welldifferentiated hepatocytes with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, marked steatosis and without portal triads. It showed malignant transformation area consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: Hepatocellular carcinoma arising in the setting of hepatocellular adenoma is a rare phenomenon and has been reported in 4-8 % of cases. Advanced age, male gender, use of anabolic steroids, metabolic syndrome, and large tumour size have been cited as risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma transformation in an adenoma. Objective: Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign liver tumours, currently classified in four subtypes: Type 1 (HNF-1\u03b1-inactivated HCA) caused by mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1\u03b1) gene; Type 2 (\u03b2-catenin-activated), with \u03b2-catenin over-expression and upregulation of glutamine synthetase (GS); Type 3 (inflammatory), with increased expression of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid-A (SAA). Type 4 (unclassified). Method: The present a case of pigmented HCA, developed in a 27-yearold female, without history of contraceptive use, displaying the features of subtypes 2 and 3 of HCA according to the histological and immunohistochemical profile. Results: The biopsy and subsequent partial hepatic resection displayed similar features. The tumour was composed by unicellular trabeculae of hepatocytes and solid areas, and it was notorious the deposition of dark brown granules of Dubin-Johnson-like pigment, strongly positive with Masson-Fontana stain. By immunohistochemistry, there was nuclear expression of B-catenin, diffuse expression of GS, and multifocal expression of CRP and SAA. Conclusion: The present case is an example of a very rare pigmented (dark) HCA with inflammatory features and \u03b2-catenin activation. Similar to this, there is only one other case reported in the literature. \u03b2-catenin activation, considered a risk factor of malignant transformation, should be searched for in pigmented HCAs. Objective: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis that affects the tunica media of small and medium caliber arteries without the presence of glomerulonephritis or vasculitis or without association with anti-cytoplasmic neutrophil antibodies (ANCA) positivity. Generally involves various organs such as kidneys, skin, central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The presence of hepatic involvement by the PAN is uncommon and difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis is complicated because of unspecific serological tests and clinical features; therefore it must be based on histopathological analysis. Method: We describe the case of a 75 year old woman with no previously known disease that required an urgent right hepatectomy due to a liver rupture with hemoperitoneum. Results: Histologically there is an inflammatory and haemorrhagic abscess. The liver injury was consistent with nongranulomatous acute necrotizing vasculitis. The gallbladder had acute vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis in muscular arteries of parietal medium caliber. Conclusion: Spontaneous hepatic rupture is a rare entity with very few cases in the literature reviewed, however it has a high mortality. Early diagnosis is crucial in this disease, Therefore an extensive and exhaustive history is required, and a pathological study is essential to confirm the diagnosis of PAN type vasculitis. Objective: Desmoid tumours (DTs) are a rare type of benign soft tissue tumour. They are characterized by dense fibroblastic proliferation in an abundant collagenous extra-cellular matrix. Although they have no metastatic potential, they are locally aggressive with a high recurrence rate.",

During surgery, a giant mass measuring 37 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 12 cm within the distal pancreas invading spleen was noted. The clinical diagnosis of solid cystic pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas was suspected. Results: Distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and debulking surgery was performed. Histopathologic analysis showed that the tumour had infiltrated the spleen and pancreatic parenchyma and sections of the solid areas revealed proliferation of spindle-shaped or stellate cells growing in fascicular and storiform patterns within a myxoid intercellular matrix. Cystic areas were entrapped excretory pancreatic ducts. Interestingly, there were two ectopic adrenal tissues peripherally. The histopathologic and immunohistochemical features were consistent with solid cystic desmoid tumour of pancreas. Conclusion: Desmoid tumours of the pancreas are very rare and if they present as a solid-cystic lesion their diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case for its rarity and huge size and emphasize regular follow up since long-term prognosis is currently unkown. Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate the degree of correlation between lymphocytes modulation of necroinflammatory process in chronic hepatitis B and C and the severity of specific lesions. Method: We investigated 33 and 38 cases with chronic hepatitis B and C, respectively. Immunohistochemical labeling was performed by anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibody. The quantitative assessment was performed by counting positive cells in 10 microscopic fields with the highest density of lymphocytes, at 200 \u00d7 magnification. Statistical analysis used GraphPad Prism ver. 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Results: In chronic B hepatitis, CD8+ T lymphocytes showed a statistically significant increase of number between mild versus moderate necroinflammatory activity (p = 0.01), mild versus severe (p = 0.0007) and moderate versus severe necroinflammatory activity (p = 0.02), and CD4+ T lymphocytes showed statistically highly significant differences between the three degrees of necroinflammatory activity (p < 0.0001).",

            "text": "A 19 year-old female patient was admitted with a vesiculopustular rash involving the face, trunk and mucosas. Cushing syndrome associated with a hypophyseal adenoma had been diagnosed in this patient. Two weeks before admission she contacted with a sister with varicella-zoster infection. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, mild trombocytopenia, rhabdomyolisis, high levels of TGO (1874 U/l), TGP (2163 U/l) and GGT (342 U/l). The diagnosis of acute hepatitis was established and a liver biopsy was performed. Results: By histology, the liver parenchyma displayed diffuse macrovesicular steatosis and multiple nodular foci of confluent coagulative necrosis, a pattern described in the literature as \"granulomatous necrosis\". Widespread cholestasis with bile thrombi was observed. Viral inclusions, nuclear or cytoplasmatic, were not identified. Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Conclusion: Varicella is usually a self limited disease. Visceral complications can occur in 30-50 % of immunocompromised patients. Disseminated disease can course with severe acute hepatitis and it can be fatal in the absence of antiviral therapy. \"Granulomatous necrosis\" may be a hint for the nosological diagnosis. Results: Studied cases were represented by 28 (23.0 %) cholangiocarcinomas (15 male and 13 female, mean age-54.11, average tumour size-7.73 cm) and 82 (67.2 %) hepatocellular carcinoma (25 female and 57 male, mean age-57.62, average tumour size-4.06 cm). In 61 cases was performed immunohistochemistry for VEGF (18 cases with colangiocarcinoma and 43 cases with hepatocelular carcinoma) and in 35 cases for CD 34 (9 cases with colangiocarcinoma and 26 cases with hepatocelular carcinoma), all cases being tested for Ki67 with assessing the differences and correlations between groups mentioned above. Conclusion: Ki67 was over expressed in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and it is correlated with the survival making it a promising independent prognostic immunohistochemical marker. VEGF was expressed in about 95 % of cases with hepatocellular carcinoma and colangiocarcinoma, and CD 34 was expressed in 80 % in cases with hepatocellular carcinoma versus about 90 % of cases with colangiocarcinoma, resembling slight increase in neovascularization. Objective: Our study aimed to realize a qualitative and quantitative characterization of tryptase positive mast cells (MCT+MCs) in colorectal liver metastases and to analyze their possible role as prognostic factor. Method: Fifty patients diagnosed with colorectal liver metastases were included in the study. Mast cells were identified by using mast cell tryptase antibody and assessed at intratumoral and peritumoral levels. The quantitative data were statistically correlated with clinicopathological factors and overall survival. Results: Within tumoural areas a small number of MCT+MCs scattered between the tumoural cells and grouped around blood vessels were identified. The number of MCT+MCs was higher at the invasion front, as compared to intratumoral zones, and their presence was associated with the inflammatory infiltrate. Non-degranulated MCT+MCs were predominantly disposed intratumoral, while degranulated type was identified mostly peritumoral. Intratumoral MCT+MCs were significantly correlated with tumour grade and N parameter from TNM staging, and significant differences were noted between peritumoral MCT+MCs and overall survival. Conclusion: Our study offers evidences for the promoter role of mast cells in metastatic process. Moreover, mast cells presence within the inflammatory infiltrate that outline the metastatic area sustains their involvement in the activation of a local immunologic defense that can influence the survival rate.

Results: Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a low density in the right segment of liver. Right hepatic lobectomy was performed, and grossly, a well defined solid mass was found measuring 8.0 x 5.0 x 2,5 cm. The histopathologic findings showed adenosquamous carcinoma with a mixture of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the squamous areas were positive for high molecular weight cytokeratins, CK5/6, p63. These markers were negative in the adenocarcinoma component. The patient died 12 months after surgery. Conclusion: The incidence of adenosquamous carcinoma is rather common in the gall bladder, pancreas, stomach, thyroid, large intestine and liver. Primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile duct is a rare tumour that represents less than 1.0 % of all malignant neoplasms and less than 3.0 % of all the tumours of the gastrointestinal system. Objective: Septate gallbladder (GB) is a rare congenital abnormality that may impact on bile streaming and stagnation. We aimed to report the characteristics of 20 cases of GB septae occuring in adults, diagnosed on surgically resected gallbladder specimens. Method: 20 surgically resected GBs with parietal septae were selected. The main clinical and morphological features of the resected specimens were tabulated and studied for relationships. Results: The age varied between 19 and 93 years (median, 66) and the gender ratio was 1:1. All GB showed chronic cholecystitis but one (acute cholecystitis). Lithiasis was seen in 16 GBs. All GB-septae comprised two mucosas and two muscle layers, either fusioned (8) or separated by adventitial tissue (n = 12). The septum size varied between 2-14-mm in height, ten septae being greater than 5-mm. Multiple septae were observed in 8 GBs and complete septae in 5. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that GB septae show a wide range of sizes from milimetric to above 1-cm. Rare cases may be alithasic or associate to acute cholecystitis.",

Method: The research of postoperative biopsy samples of 120 patients, who underwent surgery for cancer of kidney, urinary bladder and prostate. Scanning microscopy was carried out directly after surgery without fixations of samples. Results: The prognostic significance of increasing of oxygen, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus in place of presence of tumour cells is revealed at use of point determination of macro-and microelements under control of electron microscopy The progressive decreasing of these elements at the distance from tumour clone was revealed. The raster and atomic power microscopy helped to reveal weak connection between tumour cells, their three-dimensional sizes were shown, the congestion of clones from several cells and passage of tumour's emboli through endothelium of blood vessels also were showed. Conclusion: Complex use of biochemical and morphological methods allowed to enter new data in research of morphogenesis of malignant tumours of urinary system. The scanning microscopy can be used as an express-method for diagnostics of tumour growth. Objective: It was recently shown that lipid droplets appear in the cytoplasm of cocultured lymphocytes and monocytes incubated 24 h in vitro. We tried to determine whether the addition of lovastatin for 24 h in the culture medium affects the morphology of the cells and formation of lipid droplets in mononuclear cells taken from peripheral blood. Method: Mononuclear cells taken from peripheral blood of hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic persons were incubated with and without lovastatin for 24 h. Subsequently cells were fixated with glutaraldehyde, embedded in EPON resins, and ultra-thin sections were made. Transmission electron microscope (Morgagni 268D) photomicrographs were used to determine morphological characteristics of cells and analyzed with coherent point grids to determine the fractional volumes of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells. Results: After 24 h incubation cultured mononuclear cells from hyperlipidemic persons contained larger numbers of autophagic vacuoles and lipid droplets than cultured mononuclear cells from normolipidemic persons. Lovastatin treatment did not influence the number or volume of lipid droplets in all cultured cells. Objective: It was suggested that spontaneous neuroblastoma cell death may occur via autophagic degeneration. On the other hand, autophagy plays a protective role in tumour cells. It is well established that mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger an autophagic response. The aim of this study was to quantify autophagic vesicles and damaged mitochondria in the cells of different neuroblastoma subtypes. Method: Tumour tissue biopsies of neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma were obtained from pediatric patients, fixed in glutaraldechide, embedded in EPON and thin sections were examined by transmission electron microscope (Morgagni 268D). Autophagosomes, autolysosomes, intact and damaged mitochondria were counted on photomicrographs. Results were presented as numbers of autophagic vesicles and as the percentage of damaged mitochondria in the cells of different neuroblastoma subtypes. Results: There are statistically highly significant differences in the numbers of autophagic vesicles between all three subtypes of neuroblastoma specimens studied with more aggressive tumours having larger numbers of these structures. There are highly statistically significant differences in the proportion of damaged mitochondria between the poorly differentiated neuroblastoma specimen vs. ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma specimens with more aggressive tumours having larger numbers of damaged mitochondria. Conclusion: Results of this study emphasize the importance of autophagy and mitochondria damage in more aggressive neuroblastoma subtypes.",

Method: Eighty five placentas of women with preeclampsia were researched by light, transmissional and raster microscopy with elemental analysis. Results: The number of intermediate villi was increased and the number of terminal villi was decreased. Spasm of some vessels was along the entire length, their depth was 1,2 \u00b1 0,5 \u03bcm(1,9 \u00b1 0,4 \u03bcm in control group). Another group of vessels were full-blooded. The decreasing of relief's drop (1,4 \u00b1 0,2 and 1,7 \u00b1 0,1 \u03bcm) due to sclerotic tissue was predominately inside the villi. The growth of fibrinoid occurs. Blood clots were detected in 20-25 % of vessels. Erythrocytes in capillaries and intervillous space were spiciform and deformed and had forms of normocytes, bloated disk, complete and incomplete sphere. The number of microcytes was increased. The destruction of syncytiotrophoblast with fragmental zones of necrosis and desquamation were detected. The content of oxygen, magnesium and phosphorus was decreased in endothelium cells and syncytiotrophoblast. Conclusion: The desquamation of syncytiotrophoblast and villi, alteration of erythrocytes' forms contributes to further progression of preeclampsia, but violation of blood circulation, decreasing of content of microelements in chorion threaten the fetus and newborn. Objective: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Barrett esophagus (BE) has been proven as effective procedure in complete eradication of metaplastic and dysplastic epithelium. Concern was given upon dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) inside neosquamous epithelium (NSE), as it could lead to BE recurrence. We measured the intercellular spaces of NSE by comparing it to that of the native upper squamous epithelium (USE) in patients after RFA, and consecutive surgical or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) treatment. Method: Endoscopic biopsies were obtained from NSE in patients who underwent RFA. Biopsies of NSE were compared to USE from the same patients morphologically by electron microscopy. Biopsies were fixed in glutaraldehyde, embedded in EPON and thin sections were examined by transmission electron microscope (Morgagni 268D). On each photomicrograph (magnification 2800x) the diameter of the intercellular space for each cell layer is obtained in microns by measuring the length of a line drawn perpendicularly to the neighboring membranes. Results: Diameters of intercellular spaces of NSE were higher than those of USE in all of the specimens studied. These differences were shown to be statistically highly significant (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The results of this study emphasis the presence of DIS inside NSE, and need for endoscopic follow-up despite complete macroscopic BE eradication. Objective: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), previously known as histiocytosis X, is a rare idiopathic disorder of reticulo-endothelial system with abnormal proliferation of bone marrow derived Langerhans cells. The clinical presentation of LCH is variable and it mostly affects the skin and mucosa in the form of seborrheic dermatitis-like lesions on face and scalp along with internal organ involvement. Fortyfive-year-old male diagnosed with LCH with lung and lymph node involvement developed generalized exfoliative dermatitis -erythrodermia. Method: Skin biopsy was fixed in 3 % glutaraldehyde, rinsed in cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, and processed for embedding in EPON. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined by transmission electron microscope (Morgagni 268D). Results: Langerhans cell histiocytosis was confirmed by electron microscope examination of skin biopsy. Specific markers of LCH, known as Birbeck granules, were found in the cytoplasm of histiocytes found in connective tissue of the skin samples. These granules possessed tennisracket morphology with transverse striations. Intercellular edema was found between keratinocytes. Conclusion: This case of LCH is unusual due to the generalized involvement of skin with the disease, and the skin presentation of LCH in the form of erythrodermia. Objective: Minimal deviation melanoma is a controversial entity encompassing a heterogeneous group of lesions, composed of a monotonous cell population, that were more atypical than ordinary nevi but less atypical than conventional melanomas. In a dermatopathology practice, placement of these problematic lesions into benign or malignant categories is difficult. The aim of this study was to estimate karyometric variables and Ki67 index in minimal deviation melanomas. Method: On digital pictures, karyometric variables (nuclear area, optical density, Feret diameter, perimeter, circularity, and integrated optical density (IOD)) and Ki-67 index were estimated in deep portions of 10 cases of minimal deviation melanomas, 15 cases of nodular malignant melanomas, 10 Spitz nevi, 5 cases of cellular blue nevi, and 22 cases of compound nevi, using software ImageJ. In each case a hundred nuclei were measured. Results: In minimal deviation melanomas, Ki-67 index and nuclear size were higher than in Spitz nevi, cellular blue nevi and compound nevi (p < 0.05). Differences between minimal deviation melanomas and nodular malignant melanomas were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The results from our study suggest that karyometry and Ki-67 index, estimated in deep portions of the lesions, can be used as diagnostic tool in dermatopathology of melanocytic tumours. Objective: The current method of grading prostate carcinoma uses the Gleason system, which has been shown to be influenced by inter/intra observer variability. In order to overcome this drawback, computer aid grading systems have been proposed, almost all of them targeting cellular or glandular components. We propose a new approach to Gleason pattern evaluation by tumour stroma assessment through a computational based image evaluation. Method: From a total number of 34 cases, 299 digital images of the tumoural fibrillary network, labeled following Gleason system were acquired from G\u00f6m\u00f6ri stained sections with 20x magnification. Fractal dimension, estimated through a box counting algorithm was computed on the skeleton of the black and white (binary) images obtained with a fixed threshold from the tumoural fibrillary network images. Objective: Osteoporosis is degenerative diseases and major health problem of the 20-first century. Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and strength, and typically afflicts women in the sixth decade of life. In osteoporosis, bone biopsy is the only method that reveals the trabecular architecture. The aim of this study is to reveal usefulness of 3D reconstruction of bone tissue from histologic sections to estimate trabecular atrophy, and interruption of trabecular continuity in osteoporosis. Method: Twenty four bone specimens were extracted from the lower limb (n = 12) and maxilla (n = 12) of patients with osteoporosis Wednesday, 9 September 2015, 09.30 -10.30, Restaurant PS-18 Poster Session IT in Pathology (n = 16) and without pathological conditions (n = 8). Formalin-fixed samples of bone tissue were decalcified by formic acid and embedded in paraffin wax. Histological sections, 5 um thick, were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome. Integrated optical density (IOD) of decalcified bone tissue was estimated by ImageJ software. Alignment and tracing of serial sections were done by Reconstruct software. Results: Trabecular thickness was significantly lower in osteoporotic patients compared to normal patients. In contrasts, IOD and interruption of trabecular continuity were significantly higher in osteoporotic patients compared to control group. Conclusion: 3D reconstruction of bone tissue from histologic sections reveals increased interruption of trabecular continuity in osteoporotic bone tissue. Objective: The Ki-67 index in meningiomas and oligodendrogliomas helps to discrimination of patients into good and worse prognostic groups. Introduction of autostainer equipment and automatization of hot-spot selection in a WSI effect changes in Ki-67 ranges that should be evaluated. Method: The 15 cases of meningiomas and oligodendrogliomas were stained one manually with the liquid monoclonal mouse anti-human Ki-67 antigen (clone MIB-1, Dako, code M7240), and second with the ready-to-use FLEX Ki-67 antigen (Dako, code IR626) in Dako Autostainer Link. After digitalization to WSI a selection of hotspots was done manually by an expert and automatically with an proposed algorithm based on mathematical morphology and penalty function. Results: The comparison of Ki-67 index counted in the expert's selected hot-spots indicates an average 2.3 % higher level in automatically to manually stained specimens. Against, the automatic hot-spot selection results average 3.5 % increasing in Ki-67 level in manually stained specimens whereas only 1 % in FLEX. Conclusion: The FLEX and autostainer's procedure effect about 3 % higher results of Ki-67 index evaluation in meningiomas and oligodendrogliomas. The automatic hot-spot selection effects a more stable results than in manually stained specimens.

Method: SamanTree Medical has developed a novel digital microscopy approach, which enables rapid histological imaging of fresh tissue at high resolution (sub-micron) over a large field of view (several cm2). Results: We present here the imaging proof-of-concept on fresh and thick tissue of animal and human origin. Conclusion: We believe that this approach is ideally-suited for rapid intra-operative histo-pathological assessment. Objective: CRO-Biobank (the Biobank of the National Cancer Institute CRO Aviano) is a structured facility integrated in a clinical setting aimed at collecting human biological samples for cancer research purposes. Many biobanks are growing worldwide, but our challenge was to organize a collection of tissue samples with associated biomaterials: serum, plasma (with different anticoagulants), buffy coat and nucleid acid extracted both from tissue and from blood. Method: Tissue and other biosamples are collected from patients who underwent surgery for different cancer pathologies. Tissue samples are paraffin-embedded and, when possible, OCT-embedded and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Well defined tissue control methods are used: histocytology (frozen sections, FFPE mirrored samples, and cytological imprint) and molecular pathology. Molecular analyses are randomly performed as methods for DNA, RNA and protein quality checks, using appropriate positive and negative controls, with promising results. Results: From 2009 we collected more than 10,000 blood samples (associated with tissue samples) from about 3000 patients. We optimized technical and quality processes, while also investigating ethical, legal, and IT topics. We implemented processes aimed at guaranteeing the safety of the providers, protecting patient privacy, and ensuring both the traceability and the quality of samples. We are evaluating an alternative one-step tissue biomarker and histology preservative for clinical diagnosis, molecular analysis and biobanking. Conclusion: Our pluriannual experience allows to offer insights and useful suggestions that may serve as reference model for similar initiatives. Objective: In 2009 the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA) introduced synoptic reporting (SR) in the Netherlands for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) resections. This study investigates whether SR improved the quality of gross examination and pathology reports compared to narrative reports (NR). Method: Pathology data of all CRC patients from 2007 to 2013 was gathered using the Dutch Cancer Registry, (data from NR and SR), and linked to PALGA (SR data). Quality of CRC gross examination and PA reports was evaluated by the percentage of \u226510 lymph nodes (LN) collected and the percentage of reported circumferential margin (CRM) respectively and compared between SR and NR. Results: Data on 84098 patients was collected, 31.5 % patients had rectal carcinoma. 64494 patients received a NR and 19604 a SR. The percentage of \u226510 LN collected between 2009 and 2013 was higher in SR (85.12 %) than NR (52.50 %) (p < 0.001). Furthermore, CRM was reported more often in SR (99.7 %) vs NR (86.5 %) for rectal carcinoma.",

It has been and still is a major clinical challenge to differentiate between TBMN characterized by nonprogressive hematuria and Alport syndrome with progressive hematuria as the main symptom. Method: 8-year-old girl was admitted to Pediatric Department due to hematuria. The patient underwent a kidney biopsy which showed a normal gromeruli, Immunofluorescence with IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 was negative. Electron microscopy revealed diffuse thinning of glomerular basement membrane. On the basis of ultrastructural findings TBMN was established. Results: Four years later the girl was admitted to Pediatric Department due to hematuria and proteinuria 2g/24 h. Rebiopsy was performed. Renal tissue contained glomeruli with slight mesangial hypercellularity and mesangial matrix expansion. Immunofluorescence with IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, C3, lambda light and kappa light chain was negative. Renal tissue for electron microscopy study contained seven glomeruli with 3 mesangial cells in mesangial area and increase in mesangial matrix. Measurement of GBM was performed. Glomerular basement membrane was not uniformly thin, and had an irregular epithelial surface. There were thick areas as well as thin, patches of complex splitting of the lamina densa (a \"basket-weave\" pattern). On the basis of electron microscopy study nephropathy in Alport Syndrome was diagnosed. Conclusion: This case illustrates difficulties in the differentiate thin basement membrane nephropathy and nephropathy in Alport Syndrome. The changes in GBM usually become more marked with time, and definite diagnosis may require another renal biopsy, a few years after the first.",

            "text": "Objective: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal urologic cancer. The most common type of RCC is the clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Currently, the curative treatment is surgery. However, 20-30 % of patients with ccRCC recurrence within 5 years after an initial nephrectomy. Recent reports have shown that expression of CD44 may play an important role in predicting prognosis. Method: We investigated CD44 immunohistochemical expression in 89 paraffin-embedded ccRCC tissue samples and its correlation with tumour clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. Results: The 55 (61,79 %) ccRCC specimens displayed a positive membranous staining reaction for CD44, while 34 (38,21 %) had a negative staining. Positive staining was defined as (1 < 25 % of epithelial cells), 2(25-50 %), 3(>50 %). For statistical analysis the stained tumours tissues were divided into two groups: in the CD44-low expression group in which included the samples(1,2) and negative cases (CD44-LEG = 68cases) and those in CD44high expression(3) (CD44-HEG = 21cases). The CD44-HEG compared with CD44-LEG tender to have higher Tstage (P < 0,0013). Also CD44-HEG was significant associated with high nuclear grade (P = O,012) and tumour recurrence (P < 0,001) than those in the CD44-LEG. Conclusion: CD44 may serve as a useful molecular marker because its expression is considered as poor prognostic factor for tumour recurrence and survival Objective: Among renal sarcomas representing 1-2 % of all malignant renal tumours in adults, leiomyosarcomas are the most common accounting for 50-60 %. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman with haematuria and fever. CT scan revealed a large right renal mass without any vascular or hepatic metastasis and right nephrectomy was performed. Method: We received the right kidney measuring 19 \u00d7 8.5 \u00d7 8 cm and weighting 180 g. At the upper and middle portion of the kidney we observed an encapsulated yellowish tumour measuring 9 \u00d7 7.5 \u00d7 6 cm with a nodular external surface. Results: Microscopically we observed a malignant tumour comprising of spindle cells arranged in interlacing bundles, whorled pattern and sheets. The cells were spindle shaped with eosinophilic cytoplasm, elongated and blunt-ended nuclei. They stained positive for Vimentin, HHF-35 and Desmin and rarely positive for EMA, CD10 and CD68. The mitotic rate was 24mitosis/10 HPF and tumour necrosis estimated <50 %. A diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma Grade 2 was made. Conclusion: Renal leiomyosarcomas arise from smooth muscle tissue of renal pelvis, capsule or vessels, clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from more common renal malignancies. They usually have an aggressive behavior with poor prognosis. Total surgical resection, size<5 cm, low histologic grade and negative lymph node metastasis seem to be associated with better prognosis. Objective: Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked disease, so a patient affected relatives should be assessed. Urine cytology may be useful as screaning test and in the evolution of the disease. Method: We present a 49-year-old male affected from hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, non-nephrotic proteinuria and creatinine level 1.4 mg/dl. Microscopically, our renal biopsy presented segmental glomerulosclerosis and vacuolated podocytes, PAS+ that were all over the sample. Immunofluorescence result was negative. Ultrastructurally it presented inclusion bodies, osmiophilics, myeloid bodies mainly in the cytoplasm of podocytes. By oil-red staining in fresh tissue we objectify the lipid content of these cells, which are characteristics, very similar to those found in urine cytology and immunohistochemically identified as podocytes. Activity of alpha-galactosidase-A showed a value below normal. A genetic mutation associated FD was detected. Results: By a familiar study we detected heterozygous mutation in the mother and sister (without clinical manifestations) and a brother with cardiac manifestations. Conclusion: FD should be included in the differential diagnosis of proteinuria: urinary cytology may be useful in this screening and treatment response. It is necessary to confirm clinical suspicion with enzymatic and genetic study and study their relatives to detect other cases. Objective: The capillary lesions of chronic antibody-mediated rejection are transplant glomerulopathy (cg) and circumferential peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering (ptcml). Correlations were sought between the two lesions expressed quantitatively. Method: The corresponding Banff cg scores were reassessed in 61 cases with cg and microvascular inflammation. The status of ptcml was read electronmicroscopically as ptc-s with 1 or 2 layers, 3 or 4 layers, 5 or 6 layers, 7 or 8 layers or 9 or more layers, and the average ptcml level was calculated. The number of cases fulfilling the Banff criterion of severe ptcml (\u2265 7 layers in one cortical ptc and \u2265 5 in two additional ptc-s) was additionally recorded. Results: The mild (cg1) and moderate-severe (cg2-3) groups differed significantly in average ptcml level, with a cut-off of 2.9 layers/ptc between cg1 and cg2-3. The 42 % of the series that fulfilled the Banff ptcml criterion displayed a cut-off of 3.8 layers/ptc. Conclusion: This study revealed that cases expressing cg2-3 lesions and cases fitting the Banff ptcml criteria differed in average layers/ptc cut off. \u2265 2.9 ptcml layers/ptc. Objective: Diagnosis of Fibrillary Glomerulopathies requires Electron Microscopic examination and often poses differential diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. Two cases of fibrillary glomerulonephritis in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus are presented. Method: Histochemistry, immunofluorescene and electron microscopy. Results: Two female patients aged 65 and 43 years presented with nephrotic proteinuria. Both had a history of diabetes mellitus, the first with coexistant diabetic retinopathy, the second during her second pregnancy.",

Immunofluorescence demonstrated intense IgG, C3 and \u03ba-light-chain in the first case and intense IgG, C3, \u03bb & \u03ba chains in the second case, in a pattern mimicking membranous nephropathy, however more smudgy and with additional mesangial deposits. Electron microscope revealed mesangial and GBM occupation by non-branching, haphazardly arranged fibrils measuring 10-24 nm. Moreover, membranous and mesangial electron dense immunodeposits containing the same fibrillar material were shown. Based on these findings a diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulonephritis was suggested in both cases, probably on a background of diabetic fibrillosis. Conclusion: Fibrillary glomerulonephritis is rare and its coexistence with diabetes mellitus -probably not coincidental but pathogenetically relatedhampers its diagnosis and perplexes its management. There were a number of renal cysts lined with flattened epithelium, without atypia. Pathology assessment of the non-tumour specimen revealed a chronic diffuse and global glomerular and interstitial lesions within the class IV lupus nephritis. Conclusion: The duration of kidney disease, less often than the dialysis, can be a more significant determining factor in the development of acquired cystic disease and systemic erythematous lupus.",

            "text": "Objective: The most frequent brucellae-associated genitourinary involvement is epididymo-orchitis. Renal involvement in brucellosis is divided into three main groups: interstitial nephritis or pyelonephritis, granulomas resulting from chronic brucellosis and renal involvement in association with brucella endocarditis. A limited number of case reports regarding glomerular involvement have been published. Method: Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Results: A 39-year-old man with serologically proven brucellosis and febrile episodes since 2011, was admitted to the hospital due to brucellamelitensis bacteraemia in the course of which he developed nephrotic syndrome. A renal biopsy was performed. The main clinical differential diagnosis included a tubulointerstitial nephritis associated either with brucella infection or with the use of antibiotics and a glomerulonephritis. Renal biopsy showed a glomerulonephritis with membranoproliferative pattern associated with immunoglobulin deposition, complemement factors and light chains. Electron microscopy confirmed this pattern. A diagnosis of glomerulonephritis with membranoproliferative pattern-immunoglobulin mediated was supported. Conclusion: Although mild proteinuria is commonly observed during the course of brucellosis, nephrotic syndrome with biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis is quite rare. A few cases of brucella-associated glomerulonephritis have been published, four showing a membranoprolipherative pattern. The management of patients is based on the control of the infection while treatment with steroids may be useful in some instances. Objective: Renal involvement in patients with underlying hematological diseases may be direct or indirect. A patient with acute myelogenous leukemia and another with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia underwent a renal biopsy due to proteinuria and renal function impairment. Method: Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Results: In the first case, no glomerular pathology was established.The main finding was an interstitial infiltrate localized predominantly in the corticomedullary junction. This infiltrate could be easily overlooked as non-specific. However, immunohistochemistry revealed a myelomonocytic phenotype of the infiltrate consistent with renal involvement by the underlying acute myelogenous leukemia. In the second case, a membranous glomerulopathy was shown by means of light microscope and immunofluorescence. However, a striking finding was the presence into the glomerular and peritubular capillaries of medium sized cells with nephroid or oval nuclei, LCA, PGM1, MPO, CD43 and to a lesser extent CD15 positive but CD3,CD20, c-kit and HLA-DR negative, consistent with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cells. Infiltration of the interstitial tissue was not observed. The possibility of a secondary (paraneoplastic) membranous glomerulopathy was raised. Conclusion: Renal infiltrates or circulating cells may provide clues to the diagnosis of underlying hematological diseases not only in cases of direct renal involvement but also in cases of glomerulopathies arising in their background. Objective: Although their pathogenetic mechanisms are different, thrombotic microngiopathy (TMA) may be diagnosed as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) histopathologically even by experienced nephropathologists. Method: A 9-year-old boy was admitted with acute kidney injury and edema. Past medical history revealed recurrent diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia/hypogammaglobulinemia and anemia since his infancy. He had been diagnosed with protein losing enteropathy. He had undergone renal biopsies at 2 times before and had been diagnosed as MPGN. Laboratory tests revealed anemia, renal impairment (creatinine: 1.6 mg/dl, urine volume was 0,72 ml/kg/h), hypoalbuminemia, microscopic hematuria, proteinuria (3457 mg/day) and hypogammaglobulinemia. Serum C3 was low, C4 was normal. Response to steroid therapy was unsuccessful and he required hemodialysis. A third kidney biopsy revealed typical features of acute TMA superimposed on chronic features. Patient's clinical course has been significantly improved with eculizumab therapy following 5 cycles of plasma exchange. ADAMTS13 activity was found to be normal. No mutation in DGKE has been identified. Conclusion: Good response to eculizumab treatment and beginning of symptoms in his infancy period supports the idea that it is a complementmediated disease. The complement regulatory gene mutation tests have been performed but the results have not been reported yet. Objective: Considering potential involvements of several matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) types (gelatinases-MMP2, MM9; stromelysins-MMP10, MMP11; membrane-type-MMP14, MMP24) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in tissue remodeling, we examined their expressions and assessed mRNA levels of NCAM isoforms, MMP2 and MMP9 in kidneys with incipient fibrosis. Method: MMPs and NCAM immunostainings were applied on cryostat kidney biopsies. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted on NCAM+ renal interstitial cell, obtained by laser capture microdissection, in order to detect changes in mRNA levels. Results: Statistically significant mRNAs over-expression of NCAM-140 kDa isoform (p = 0.006), and down-regulation of MMP2 (p = 0.029) and MMP9 (p = 0.037) were found in NCAM+ cells captured from incipient interstitial fibrosis. Immunomorphologically, MMP2 was focally detected as granular staining in tubular epithelial cells. MMP9 was rarely observed in interstitial cells showing an overlapping with some NCAM+ cells. However, endothelial cells of peritubular and glomerular capillaries were also MMP9 positive, especially in the cases with inflammation. In the cases associated with incipient interstitial fibrosis, MMP14 was present on particular tubular basement membranes. Conclusion: Detected switch of NCAM140 kDa isoform with regard to its up-regulation, as well as MMP2 and MMP9 mRNA downregulation in NCAM+ cells of incipient fibrosis, in addition to NCAM and MMP9 overlapping in some interstitial cells, could suggest regulatory roles of NCAM+ interstitial cells in incipient renal fibrosis. Objective: Tubuocystic renal cell carcinoma (TC-RCC) is a rare tumour entity recently included in the New Renal Epithelial Tumours and Emerging /Provisional Tumour Entities Method: We report on a 65-year-old male patient with a 3,3 cm, partially cystic mass in the middle portion of the left kidney. Left nephrectomy was performed. Results: Microscopically, the tumour consisted of tubules and cysts, lined by a single layer of flat, hobnail or cuboidal cells with a distinct nucleoli and brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumour cells were positive for vimentin, kerAE1/AE3, ker8/18, P504S and focally for ker20. Conclusion: The differential diafnosis of TC-RCC includes tumours with a multiloculated configuration, such as multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, cystic nephroma, mixed epithelial and stromal tumours, cystic oncocytoma and Xp11.2 renal cell carcinoma. Although the great majority of reported cases have behaved in an indolent manner, the biological behavior of this rare tumour has not been yet fully established. Objective: The risk of recurrence is relatively high during the 3-5 years after radical surgery in RCCs. Most frequently used the prognostic factors are tumour grade and nuclear stage. The aim of study is investigate whether CD105 is a reliable prognostic factor to guide clinical decisions or not. Method: Immunostaining for CD105 was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 57 patients with RCC who underwent nephrectomy in between 2003 and 2007. The microvessel density (MVD) of tumour tissue was measured and CD105 expression was evaluated. Results: Mean age of the patients were 61.23 years (\u00b111.277). In 54 cases microvessels of tumour were positive, three cases were negative for CD105. The mean score of CD105 expression in microvessels of the tumour was 22.653 (\u00b112.185). Tumour cells were not expressing CD105 In this study no statistically significant correlation was found between CD105 expression and gender, age, tumour size, tumour grade or stage. Conclusion: These findings suggest that CD105 does not associate with survival of RCC and CD105 may not be an ideal prognostic factor for patients with RCC. On the other hand nearly all of the cases expressed CD105 in tumour microvessels; this may be a novel therapeutic target for RCC but further studies with large groups are needed. Among proposed new epithelial neoplasms is MiT family translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) including t(6;11) renal cell carcinoma. The transcription factors include: TFE3, TFEB, TFEC, and MiTF and form MiT subfamily. The fusion of 2 of these factors has been involved in RCC pathogenesis. Method: 26-year-old man with no previous medical history presented with accidentally discovered cystic and solid tumour of the lower pole of the left kidney Histologically, neoplasm demonstrated biphasic morphology, composed of larger and smaller epithelioid cells, with the latter clustered around eosinofilic material, tubular, papillary formations and solid sheets of clear or eosinofilic cells with nuclear grade 3(Furhman). Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed melan A diffuse positivity, negative reaction for HMB 45 and CD 10, while CK showed mild positive reaction of tumour cells. The case was consulted in Plze\u0148 Biopsy laboratory where molecular genetic testing revealed TFE3 negative and TFEB positive with t (6;11) translocation, so histologic diagnosis was confirmed. Conclusion: Present case is interesting since the t(6;11) renal cell carcinomas have been recently shown to harbor a gene fusion involving TFEB but have yet to be formally recognized entity. Objective: Clear cell papillary or tubulopapillary renal cell cancer (CCPRCC) is a recently described subclass of renal neoplasms with an extraordinarily good prognosis without reported agressive spread or lympnode metastasis. Method: We present the case of a 44 years old lady without any significant previous disease. Her left kidney was removed because of a 5 cm parenchymal grayish renal tumour, which had cystic macroscopic appereance. A 2 cm big lymph node was also removed. Close follow up in 12 months up showed no relapse. Microscopically both localisation (kidney and lymphnode) contained a tumour with partly cystic, partly branching tubulopapillary pattern. Tumour cells had empty/clear cell cytoplasm and low grade nuclei. Both tumour shared similar immunophenotype: diffuse and strong cytokeratin 7, pancytokeratin, EMA, CAIX positivity; focal, mainly luminal CD10, vimentin positivity, whereas AMACR, MelanA and HMB45 were negat\u00edve. Molecular studies are in progress. Results: Morphological and immunophenotypical examinations resulted in the diagnosis of a tubulopapillary clear cell renal cell cancer which metastatized into regional lymph nodes. Conclusion: CCPRCC is described as an indolent (almost benign!) low grade renal neoplasm with no metastatic cases reported until now. Our index case raises our attention of the potential malignant behavior of this kind of tumour. Objective: Iris melanomas have a better prognosis than melanomas located in the choroid or ciliary body. Our group found that chromosome 3 loss also occurs in melanomas of the iris but it's not an indicator of poor prognosis in this uveal melanoma (UM) subtype. We want to investigate whether this chromosome 3 loss is accompanied with a loss of BAP1 expression in iris melanomas and if there is a correlation with the patients' clinical outcome. The prevalence of UM specific mutations in the genes GNA11, GNAQ, BAP1, EIF1AX and SF3B1 occur in irismelanomas was also investigated. Method: To determine the BAP1 expression we used immuno histochemistry. For mutation analysis we will use the Ion torrent next generation sequencing method. Results: Preliminary data show that loss of chromosome 3 resulted indeed in a loss of BAP1 expression in iris melanomas. Targeted sequencing using a multiplex UM gene panel is in progress and additional results may be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: Negative expression of BAP1 is present in melanomas of the iris. We need more samples to draw any solid conclusions. Objective: Mutation of SF3B1 has been identified in low-grade uveal melanoma with a good prognosis. In this study, we compare chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations between a primary uveal melanoma and its multiple hepatic and peripancreatic metastases. Method: DNA was isolated from a large primary uveal melanoma after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and three distinct metastases (two liver samples and one peripancreatic lymph node) to perform single nucleotide polymorphism array and fluorescent in situ hybridization. We analyzed mutations in uveal melanoma target genes BAP1, GNAQ, GNA11, SF3B1 and EIF1AX. Results: The primary tumour revealed no abnormalities in chromosome 3, whereas metastases showed deletion of at least 3q12.1-q24 while the Wednesday, 9 September 2015, 09.30 -10.30, Restaurant PS-20 Poster Session Ophthalmic Pathology BAP1 gene was not mutated. All samples revealed the following consistent chromosomal aberrations: loss of 1p, gain of 6p a+nd gain of 8q. Subsequently, heterozygous SF3B1 and GNA11 mutations were observed. The metastases showed more genetic aberrations than the primary tumour and therefore may represent the genetic status of the tumour prior to irradiation, whereas the current primary tumour shows presumably irradiation artifacts. An early occurring mutation in GNA11 was observed in all samples. Conclusion: The SF3B1 mutation seems to predispose for late metastatic disease in absence of a BAP1 mutation. Objective: Ocular melanoma is a rare malignancy found in clinical practice, but it is the most frequent tumour of the eye of the adults. Calcification and bone formation is an even rarer feature for this pathology, only 7 cases reported so far, mostly in correlation with brachytherapy or tumoural regression. Method: We present a case of a 59 year-old female with an aggressive tumour measuring 21 mm in diameter. Histologically, heavily pigmented, epithelioid cells (after the revised Callender classification) with clear atypical features and a mitotic index of 20-23 mitoses/mm2 were found. Results: Within the tumoural mass we observed areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, calcification, bone formation and fibrosis. Tumoural foci infiltrating the sclera, the adjacent fibro-adipose tissue, the blood vessels and the optic nerve were also seen, but without extrinsic muscles invasion. Immunohistochemical tests showed diffuse positivity of HMB-45, Melan-A and S100 whereas Ki-67 was more than 30 % positive. Lung and liver metastasis were assessed. Conclusion: Ocular melanoma has a distinct behavior in comparison to cutaneous melanoma and has a widely divergent prognosis. Approximately half of the patients will develop metastasis. No systemic therapy was associated with evident clinical outcome for patients with advanced disease and overall survival rate remains poor.

In the small clinic in detached island it is not easy to see the laboratory data which were checked in a large urban hospital. Method: For the patients who live in three small islands in Japan, the establishment of medical records using cloud system to communicate with a small clinic to a large hospital in urban area was important. To use the database of patients, the Cloud system was selected. The cloud system, virtual private network (VPN), and long term evolution (LTE) were used to communicate with the medical records. Results: Three clinics in four islands are communicating with the database in the Cloud system. After the pathologic department makes a diagnosis of the patient, the reports are sent to the database of the Cloud system. Using this system doctors can work in flex time. Conclusion: Pathology photographs are added to the medical records in the Cloud system and they have become easy to show the cancer cells to patients in detached islands. Histopathology photographs in medical records under the Cloud system become the treasure of islands. Objective: To characterize mucosal loss (ML) and apoptotic events in the small intestine after hemorrhage and volume replacement with a crystalloid, Lactated Ringers Solution (LR), and a colloid, HES130/0.4 solution, in a pig model. Method: %ML and apoptotic events at the epithelium of the villi were evaluated in the small intestine from pigs that underwent total intravenous anesthesia and passive controlled arterial bleeding, followed by volume replacement using LR (group1, n = 9) and HES130/0.4 (group2, n = 9). Apoptotic events were investigated by performing immunohistochemistry using Cytochrome c antibody and M30Cytodeath immunofluorescence assay. Results: %ML was significantly higher in group1 (P < 0.0001). Similar moderate to intense cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was seen in both groups for Cytochrome c antibody. The median percentage of apoptotic cells in the non-detached villi epithelium was 5.94 % (1.46-31.47 %) in group1 and 6.38 % (0.36-47.48 %) in group2. No significant differences were observed between groups. Conclusion: Results suggest that HES130/0.4 administration may more efficiently prevent the acute loss of intestinal mucosa, and, therefore, the integrity of the intestinal barrier. However, the indicators of intestinal apoptosis do not differ between HES 130/0.4 or RL administration. Objective: Chorangioma is a rare and benign tumour of placenta arising from chorionic tissue with a frequency of about 1 %. Chorangiomas are typically solitary and small and have no clinical significance. Large lesions are seen rarely and may be associated with maternal or fetal complication. Method: We present an incidental finding of chorangioma during the routine macroscopic examination of the placenta of a healthy 34-year old woman at 39 week of gestation whose pregnancy was normal with a normal delivery of a female neonate with 8/9 Apgar score and birth weight of 3.150 kilograms. Results: A gross examination of chorangioma show a polypoid, well circumscribed, purple-red, homogenous large mass, attached on the fetal surface of placenta and measuring 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 5 cm. Microscopic, the tumour is composed of multiple proliferating vascular chanel from capillary to cavernous size, with predominating the capillary component, lined by plump endothelial cells separated by mesenchymal stroma. Immunochistochemical stainings with CD34, CD31 and Vimentin were performed to confirm the morphological diagnosis. Conclusion: Our case demonstrate a pregnancy resulted in a healthy, eutrophic neonate despite the maternal and fetal complications associated with large chorangiomas which include intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, cardiomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia and other abnormalities. Objective: The present experience describes a nude mice model for testing angiogenic factors and chemokine expression (CXCL9, CXCL10, GRO) and their receptors at early stages of tumour growth in two xenografted human chondrosarcomas (Chs, grade II and III) and one high-grade osteosarcoma (OS), comparing the immunohistochemical expression and genomic profile. Method: Primary grade I, II and III human Chs and an OS were implanted into the backs of nude mice. Two grade I Chs did not grow in the animals. Mice were sacrificed at 24, 48, and 96 hours; and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days from transfer. The expression of angiogenic factors was studied by immunohistochemistry, molecular biology (ELISA and qRT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescent two-colored staining for CXCL9, CXCL10 and GRO with their receptors. Results: 48 h after tumour implantation a peak of HIF1\u03b1 and VEGF was observed in Ch grade III and OS, which showed later (96 h) in Ch grade II. Higher chemokine ligand expression was present at 48 h in all tumours. Moreover two genomic patterns have seen: early phase (angiogenic induction) and late phase (vascular remodeling). Expression of the angiogenic factors appeared later in Chs grade II than in Chs grade III and OS.HIF1\u03b1, VEGF and chemokines (ligands and receptors) displayed a strong activity in the early phases of tumoural growth. Neoplastic angiogenesis activation occured earlier in high-grade sarcomas (Ch grade III and OS). Conclusion: HIF1\u03b1, VEGF and chemokines (ligands and receptors) displayed a strong activity in the early phases of tumoural growth. Neoplastic angiogenesis activation occured earlier in high-grade sarcomas (Ch grade III and OS).",

Method: PLGA NPs were used (100 to 300 nm), both plain and loaded with curcumin. A total 90 adult Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups of 15 animals. Each group was administrated with a different solution (control, plain NPs, NPs with curcumin), either subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. Peripheral blood was collected and examined for CRP and IL6 levels. Specimens from the brain, liver, heart, kidney, stomach and from subcutaneous tissue were collected and examined histologically. Results: Serum markers showed inconclusive results. Hematoxylin&Eosin sections from the heart, kidney, liver and stomach showed no pathologic findings. Sections from the subcutaneous tissue demonstrated the antiinflammatory effectiveness of NPs loaded with curcumin. Histological examination of the brain specimens from the animals that received plain NPs showed minor lesions, including focal ischemia and reactive gliosis, in a few animals. Nonetheless the group that received NPs with curcumin showed no such lesions. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates, not only that the clinical applicability of Nanotechnology can be envisioned, but also the significance of Pathology in the evaluation of new technologies.",

Method: We report a case of a morbidly obese 63-year-old male, with multiple comorbidities, who presented with neurological symptoms and extensive lymphadenopathy was revealed on clinical examination and on imaging. Results: Excisional biopsy of a supraclavicular nodal mass followed and histopathological examination with the aid of immunohistochemistry lead to the diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma. Despite investigations the primary tumour site remained unrevealed and the patient received palliative chemotherapy. Conclusion: Generally, melanomas evolve from any site of the body containing melanocytes or cells that are capable of differentiating into melanocytes, although cases without an identifiable cutaneous, ocular, or mucosal primary, claimed as melanomas of unknown primary, comprise only 1-4 % of melanoma cases per year. Extensive work-up sometimes seem meaningless. It is also stated that such patients with lymph nodal disease, despite the unfavorable sign of nodal involvement fare better survival rates than common patients with known primary and lymph nodal metastasis. Objective: Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (BPOP) is anunusual reactive process composed of bone and cartilage attached to the surface of bone. Method: A 19-years-old woman, referring pain the last 2 years which increased in last 6 months, and a palpable mass on the surface of the distal end of the femur without any trauma. Radiogiography showed a calcified mass attached to the underlying cortex by a broad base. A lesion measured 2,5 \u00d7 1,5 \u00d7 0,8 cm, consisted of cartilage cap and bone tissue which histologically was a BPOP. Results: BPOP was first described in 1983 as an unusual reactive process involving the small bones of the hands and feet. However, lesions in the long bones, skull, maxilla and metatarsophalangeal sesammoid have been reported. Affects patients of any age, but most are 20-30 with a slight female predominance. The lesion is benign with good prognosis but may recur locally usually 2 months to 2 years after surgery. Complete excision with the best possible margin is the treatment of choice. Conclusion: Differential diagnosis must be made from osteochondroma, parosteal osteosarcoma, myositis, ossificans and fracture callus. Subsequent cytogenetic studies have shown a recurrent chromosomal traslocation t (1;17)(q32;q21), supporting the clonal neoplastic nature of the lesion. Objective: To demonstrate the real cost data of the pathology examinations by using the activity-based costing method and to contribute to the financial planning quality improvement and present tools to the control of costs of the departments, health managers and also the social security institution. Method: All histopathological examinations that are accepted by Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital Pathology Department during August 2014 were studied and their real costs are calculated by activity based costing method. Calculated costs were compared with the Healthcare Implementation Notification system price lists. Results: The costs of the pathology tests listed within the same pricing levels in the Healthcare Implementation Notification system list showed great differences. In this study costs of 77,4 % of the examinations costs were higher than the Healthcare Implementation Notification system price lists. Conclusion: The prices of the pathology examination listed at different levels in the Healthcare Implementation Notification system lists do not cover the real costs. Costs that are calculated by the activity based cost system may vary according to the type of service and the service of health care institutions. However, the basic parameters of the method has shown the necessity for more accurate leveling of pathology tests. Although prices also differ between countries, The Healthcare Implementation Notification system list needs to be revised in order to reflect the costs of the levels of the examinations. Objective: The pathological examination is one of the longest in the list of medical tests. Most of this time is spent on preparation of the microslide. Our goal was to have developed optimal standarts of processing by applying Nano composites.",

Carried out 96 experiments with different time intervals.One hundred ninety-two postoperative and autopsy tissue samples were used in the examination. The quality of slide were avaluted using five point score system by independent pathologists in blind methods. Results: Nanoparaffin reduces standard time of keeping tissue samples in paraffin twice. Nanoparaffin gives chance to erase chemical agent -xylene. Nanoparaffin brings significant economic impact. The results of this project highlights that the time is spent on preparation of the slide 2,5 times decreased and 3 times decreased reagents using. Conclusion: By reducing these two factors -time and agents spent, the cost-effectiveness of pathological examination is significantly increase. Objective: Cancer of Unknown Primary origin (CUP) is characterized by metastatic tumour spread without identifiable primary tumour. Our goal was to examine incidence of this heterogeneous CUP syndrome and to create a CUP classification based on clinicopathological factors. Method: Autopsies corresponding to criteria of CUP syndrome were selected using our database of 11046 autopsy cases . In type-1 (\"clinical\") CUPs, primary site was not found clinically but identified by autopsy. In type-2 (\"clinicopathological\") CUPs, primary site was not determinable either clinically, or by autopsy. Regarding type-3 (\"pathological\") CUPs, no tumour was suspected clinically whereas autopsy revealed metastatic spread from unidentifiable primary tumour. Results: Altogether 3467 malignant tumours were found including 126 CUPs (types 1/2/3: 77/39/10). Cumulative incidence rate of type-1 and -2 CUPs (corresponding to conventional CUP definition) was 3.35 %. Complete incidence rate (3.63 %) declined with time (1993-2007: 4.23 %; 2008-2014: 2.66 %) due to decreasing incidences of type-1 and -3 CUPs. Histological types: adenocarcinoma~63 %, neuroendocrine~11 %, squa-mous~9 %, anaplastic~9 %, melanoma~5 %. Origins of type-1 CUPs: lung~47 %, pancreas~12 %, biliary~10 %, intestine~7.8 %, liver~6.5 % and stomach~6.5 %. Conclusion: Type-2 and -3 CUPs may originate from microscopic-sized metastasizing primary tumours. Based on above classification, improvement of clinical diagnostics may contribute to decreased incidence of type-1 CUPs and transfer of type-3 CUPs into type-2 category.",

Petrusevska * University Skopje, Institute of Pathology, Medical Faculty, Republic of Macedonia Objective: The tissue microarray (TMA), first described by Battifora (1986) and first implemented in 1998 by Kononen et al., is a powerful research and quality control toll used in many Pathology lnstitutions. Unfortunately, all the commercial aray instruments are very expensive and thus not suitable for laboratories with limited funds. We describe simple, fast and cost-effective method for constructing of manual TMA. Method: Skin punch biopsy needle of 2-mm diameter was used for extracting cores from 60 donor blocks with normal bladder tissue and muscle-invasive bladder cancer and for injecting into recipient block. A modified metal wire was used as a stylet. Adhesive dot-grid paper was attached to the surface of the bare paraffin block and used as guide to make array pores. The cores were then transfered to the prepared holes in the recipient block. The tissue array was sectioned using a standard microtome and used for Van-Gieson Elastica staining, HER-2 immunodectection and silver in situ hybridization. Results: We successfully performed histochemical, immunohistochemical and silver in situ hybridization studies on a self-made tissue microarray, without any substantial tissue loss. Conclusion: This method could be done by any pathology laboratory and represents good and reliable alternative for commercially available, expensive devices. Objective: Angiomyomatous hamartoma is a vascular disorder of uncertain histogenesis that usually involves inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. Method: A 7-year-old boy presented with a right inguinal mass measuring 6 cm in MRI. The patient underwent an excisional tumour biopsy. At the pathology lab we received an encapsulated multilobular cystic mass 6, 2 cm in greatest diameter, filled with blood-serous fluid. Its solid component was brown to yellow and had a soft consistency. Results: Microscopically the tumour represented a lymph node with parenchymal replacement by fibrous tissue consisting of spindle shaped cells and containing a large number of small anastomosing vessels as well as a large amount of mature adipose tissue. No nuclear hyperchromasia or pleomorphism was observed. Differential diagnosis included lymph node hemangioma, angiomatous fibrous histiocytoma, angiomyomatous hamartoma and nodal lymphangiomyomatosis Immunohistochemically spindle cells were SMA positive, while CD34 demonstrated the vessel wall. The final diagnosis was that of angiomyomatous hamartoma. Conclusion: Angiomyomatous amartoma is a rare process probably of hamartomatous nature which is mainly supported by the disorganized pattern of growth and its mixed components. Some authors suggest that it represents a disordered angiogenic process arising from hilar vein correlated with chronic impairment of lymphatic flow.",

Group NS was not postoperatively treated; Group G was stimulated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); Group GM was stimulated with recombined humane granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF). Newly formed mucosa was analyzed using light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy was used for the assessment of ultrastructural organization of enterocytes and development of microvilli on the apical segment were analyzed. Results: Animals in Group NS showed slow and inadequate epithelium proliferation. In the Group G, epithelium initially proliferated rapidly, but appeared atrophic after 8 weeks. Stimulation of animals in Group GM led to faster epithelization, and epithelium showed signs of advancing proliferation after 8 weeks.

Sezak * Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Izmir, Turkey Objective: We searched the utility of acetone usage as a substitute of dehydrating and clearing agents (alcohol and xylol) for a rapid tissue processing. Method: Eighty blocks with large (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.4 cm) and small (0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.3 cm) formalin-fixed tissue samples were hand-processed with acetone at 20\u00b0C (1 vs 2 h) followed by 60\u00b0C molten paraffin (varying 1-4 h vs overnight). The physical quality of the sections (disruption, folding, adhesion, cracking, thickness alterations) and the staining quality (nuclear/cytoplasmic details, uniformity) were evaluated and graded semiquantitatively as; 0: inadequate for diagnostics, 1: needs improving, 2: adequate for diagnostics. Immunhistochemical stainings were done in an automated-stainer. Results: The best scores were achived by \"2-h acetone-2-h paraffin\" combination except breast and spleen samples. Shorter aceton processing resulted in disruption and loss of adhesion in sections while prolonged (overnight) paraffin infiltration caused hardening of tissues. Section quality was adequate for diagnosis in %79 of the tested samples. Conclusion: Acetone, which is miscible with both water and paraffin, can be used as a fast, single-step dehydrating-clearing agent for many tissues without significantly altering tissue morphology and immunhistochemistry results. Fat containing tissues may require additional xylene steps. Further research is needed to reveal its efficacy as a fixation agent or its interference with molecular techniques. Method: Retrospective study of the histologically proven cases of PVNS, diagnosed between 1991 and 2014 in the Pathology Department of La Rabta's Hospital. Clinical data were reviewed for each patient and the following parameters were evaluated: gender, age at diagnosis, initial clinical symptoms and site of onset and histological features of the lesion. Results: A total of 103 patients with histologically proven PVNS were included. The majority of patients were female (62.13 %) and the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 35.4. The knee was the most frequently affected site (75 % of the cases) followed by the hip (20 %of the cases). Pain and progressive local swelling sensation were the most frequent symptoms at onset. Diagnosis was histologically proven in all cases. Hemosiderin were detected in all cases. The cell types most frequently encountered were the giant cells, histiocytes and foam cells. Conclusion: Our outcomes suggest that PVNS shows a female predominance, occurs mostly between 20-40 years and favors the knee and hip. Recurrence is frequent, particularly in the knee. However, only the histological study of the lesion allows establishing a definitive diagnosis.",

Method: It was an experimental research: male rats of the same age, weight, diet (n = 100). Among them: a control group (n = 10) -intact animals without affecting; comparison group (n = 90) -animals, which was artificially created by intra-abdominal hypertension of different degrees (15, 25, 35 mm Hg) and different exposure times (3, 12, 24 h). The method of creation of intra-abdominal hypertensionpneumoperitoneum. Results: We made a histological examination of tissue of kidneys, liver, intestines, myocardium and lung. We got these results: lung -perivascular edema, focal hemorrhage, atelectasis foci; myocardium -fragmentation of cardiomyocytes with ischemic area, vascular congestion, focal and extensive hemorrhage in the myocardium; liver -dystrophy of hepatocytes, congestion of segments central vein; kidney -dystrophy of renal tubular epithelium, perivascular hemorrhage, congestion of the capillaries. Pathological changes in the intestine were not identified. Objective: Trousseau's syndrome (TS) may be encountered in a form of diverse and polymorphic spectrum of thrombotic disorders in setting of malignant disease. We suspected that TS was an underlying cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a 49-year-old man with low cardiovascular risk and suspicious lung infiltration. Method: We represent a case of 49-year-old man with radiologically detected abnormal 15 mm shadow in right lung hilum who suddenly developed AMI. Four days later, and before diagnostic bronchoscopy, the patient died, and clinical autopsy was performed. Results: Post mortem results revealed poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma in advanced stage. Blood clots were found in medium and small branches of coronary blood vessels not only in the field of myocardial infarction, but also in surrounding non-necrotic muscle. In addition to massive AMI, ischemic infarcts were found in kidney and spleen. Occlusive thrombi and thromboemboli were found in veins and arteries of medium and small caliber in visceral organs, and in venous plexuses of the pelvis. Conclusion: Although TS is not rare, the presentation with AMI is very seldom encountered in clinical practice. For patients without clinical evidence of atherosclerosis, hypercoagulability associated with cancer as underlying cause of AMI should be considered and investigated.",

            "text": "Objective: Nephroblastoma is a frequent tumour in children but rare in adults. We report an even rarer case of an adult extrarenal nephroblastoma developed in a retroperitoneal mature teratoma, with speculated metastatic gonadal origin. Method: A 44-year-old man with a 5-month history of intermittent colicky low back pain underwent radiologic examination that revealed a large right-sided retroperitoneal cystic-solid mass. Surgical resection was performed. Grossly, a 17 cm, well circumscribed, multilocular, cystic tumour filled with green-tan fluid and containing a 6 cm solid nodular area was identified. Results: On pathology, the solid area revealed the classic triphasic pattern of nephroblastoma (blastema, stroma and epithelial glandular structures). The cystic spaces were covered by fibrin or lined by squamous epithelium and foreign body giant cells. Immunohistochemically, blastema cells were focally positive for WT-1 and vimentin, stroma for vimentin and epithelial structures for cytokeratins AE1/3. The diagnosis of nephroblastoma arising in a setting of mature teratoma was made. Urological examination was advised, which showed a small scarred calcified area in the right testis. Conclusion: The few reported cases of adult extrarenal nephroblastomas in teratomas developed in metastatic sites of gonadal teratomas. Literature search did not reveal cases of adult nephroblastoma in primary retroperitoneal teratoma. Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumours of the gastrointestinal tract and typically express c-kit/CD117. Rarely neoplasms with similar pathologic features are found outside gastrointestinal tract (omentum, mesentery, retroperitoneum) and are called extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumours (EGISTs). Only 58 cases of primary retroperitoneal EGISTs have been reported. We herein report an additional case of this rare entity. Method: A 19-year-old female presented with lower abdominal pain. Pre-operative radiological evaluation with ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a 3 \u00d7 3.8 cm retroperitoneal heterogeneous solid mass located near the left common iliac artery. She underwent surgical removal of the tumour. Results: On gross examination, we identified an encapsulated tumour 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2.5 cm and the frozen section was \"negative for malignancy\". Microscopically, the neoplastic cells were proliferating spindle cells, with mitotic rate of 0-1/50hpf. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positive staining for c-kit and CD34 and the diagnosis of GIST was confirmed. Pathologic diagnosis was GIST of low malignancy potential according to Fletcher classification. The patient had uncomplicated postoperative course and did not receive adjuvant tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy. At 2-years follow-up she remains disease-free. Conclusion: Primary EGISTs of the retroperitoneum are extremely rare. Immunohistochemistry for c-kit may help in the differential diagnosis of EGIST from other mesenchymal tumours. Objective: Over 90 % of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) in Bulgaria were reported to arise in the gastrointestinal tract. Our objective was to study the incidence and morphological characteristics of the gastroenteropancreatic NETs, diagnosed for 1 year. Method: The present retrospective study explores the incidence and morphological characteristics of the gastroenteropancreatic NETs, diagnosed and confirmed for 1 year period (during 2014) in UMHAT \"Dr. Georgi Stranski\", Pleven. Results: Seven cases of gastroenteropancreatic NETs were diagnosed and treated for the studied period. Most common primary sites were: pancreas in 4 (57.14 %) cases and 2 in colon (28.57 %) cases. According to the morphological criteria, 2 (28.57 %) were well differentiated NETs, 3 (42.86 %) were moderately differentiated, and 2 (28.57 %) were poorly differentiated NETs. One of them was mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma. All cases demonstrated immunoexpression of Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin in adition to the distinct neuroendocrine morphology. Distant site metastasis were observed in 5 (71.43 %) cases. Conclusion: According to our results, most of the gastroenteropancreatic NETs were well and moderately differentiated. A considerable number of patients had distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. The expression of Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin supported the morphological diagnosis of gastroenteropancreatic NET.",

Method: 21 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned in three groups, control group/oral administered dantrolene group/intravenous administered dantrolene group, for 3 weeks. 5 mg/kg body weight of dantrolene, in a volume of 0,3-0,5 ml/100 g weight, in a suspension of saline solution with 0,5 % carboxymethyl cellulose was given once a day.Samples of hepatic tissue were prelevated and processed for the microscopic exam. Results: The two groups of rats which received dantrolene presented large susceptibility for hepatic alterations; hepatic steatosis, signs of acute hepatitis revealing the toxicity of dantrolene. Conclusion: Long term dantrolene administration requires a clinical and laboratory monitoring of the liver functions, together with individualization of doses, in order to obtain the optimal response with minimal hepatic injuries.",

Results: mEHT resulted in progressive tumour damage compared to controls. The cell death response was accompanied increase of activated caspase-3 levels, without significant translocation from mitochondria into nuclei of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), or accumulation of Bcl-2associated X protein (BAX) in mitochondria. Stress-associated release of HMGB1 protein and increased number of CD3 positive T cells were also observed. Additional i.p. administration of a CD8+ T-cell promoting agent resulted in a systemic tumour destruction.

The aim of the study is to compare morphological changes in three types of biological tissues induced by different doses of gama and electron beam radiation. Method: Frozen biological tissues (porcine skin xenografts, human skin allografts and human amnion) were irradiated with different doses of gamma rays (12.5, 20, 35, 50 kGy) and electron beam (15, 25, 50 kGy). After melting the specimens were fixed by formalin, processed by routine paraffin technique and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, alcian blue at pH 2.5, orcein, periodic acid Schiff reaction, phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin, Sirius red and silver impregnation. Results: The basic staining showed vacuolar cytoplasmic degeneration of epidermal cells by the lowest doses of gamma and electron beam radiation. There was damage of fine elastic fibers in the xenografts dermis at the dose of 25 kGy of both radiation types. Disintegration of epithelial basement membrane was induced by the dose of 15 kGy of electron beam radiation. Disintegration of the fine collagen fibers in the papillary dermis was induced by the lowest dose of electron beam and by the highest dose of gamma radiation. Conclusion: Irradiation by both, gama rays and the electron beam, causes similar changes on cells and extracellular matrix, with singnificant damage of the basement membrane and of elastic and fine collagen fibers in the papillary dermis, the last caused already by lowest dose electron beam radiation.

Archived tumour samples were tested for morphology and for Ki67 positive proliferating fractions and CD3 positive tumour infiltrating T lymphocytes using immunohistochemistry. Results: Both EHT and mEHT treatments caused significant tumour cell death compared to the untreated control tumours. The amount of proliferating cells was found after mEHT treatment, except when EHT and control samples were compared. The number of CD3 positive T cells showed a decreasing gradient of mEHT>EHT>untreated tumours. Conclusion: Besides elevated tumour cell damage more efficient reduction of tumour cell proliferation and initiation of CD3 positive T cell accumulation accompany mEHT treatment in C26 colorectal cancer than after using plain EHT. Objective: To compare the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to autopsy findings. Method: All patients with clinical criteria and/or pathohistological diagnosis of ARDS who died in the intensive care unit within a 10-year period were included in the study. Patient's clinical charts were reviewed to establish whether patients met the Berlin definition criteria for diagnosis of ARDS, histologically defined as the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). A histopathological analysis of suspicious areas within lungs from every pulmonary lobe was made. Results: 67 patients with clinical criteria for ARDS and/or pathohistological finding of DAD have undergone the autopsy. Fortysix patients met clinical criteria as well as pathohistological criteria for ARDS, 11 patients met clinical criteria without pathohistological confirmation of DAD, and 10 patients had pathohistologically diagnosed, but clinically unrecognized ARDS. The Berlin definition clinical criteria presented a sensitivity of 82 %, positive predictive value of 80 %, and accuracy of clinical criteria was 68 %. The histopathological findings in 11 patients who met clinical criteria for ARDS without pathohistological finding of DAD were pneumonia (n = 10), and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). Conclusion: There is stil a space for further improvement of clinical criteria for recognizing ARDS in comparison to pathohistological findings. only in 5 patients Aspergillus infection was microbiologically confirmed. Conclusion: Although setting of pathohistological diagnosis allows rapid diagnosis of fungal infections, there is no possibility of a final identification of pathogens. Characteristic clinical and radiological findings, as well as laboratory confirmation of the fungus is essential for the final diagnosis.",

Method: The staining intensity of Ki-67 and p53 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical method in NSCLC (31) and SCLC (13) patients. The SUVmax measurement of each primary lung cancer lesion was obtained retrospectively. We evaluated whether there is any correlation between immunohistochemical staining intensity and SUVmax measurement of primary lung lesion. Results: We found that Ki-67 and p53 % scores were significantly higher in SCLC compared to the NSCLC (50 vs 34, p = 0.009 and 64 vs 50.9, p = 0.043, respectively). We found a significant correlation between the SUVmax values with Ki67 and p53 % values, p = 0.0001 (Pearson Correlation (PC) was 0.83) and p = 0.0001 (PC was 0.81), respectively. According to the pathologic subgroup of the lung cancer, there was a significant correlation for SUVmax with Ki-67 % (PCwas 0.96, p = 0.0001) and p53 % (PC was 0.84, p = 0.0001). Conclusion: Our analyses showed that Ki-67 % was significantly correlated with SUVmax values in patients with lung cancer in all subtypes (adenocarcinoma, squamous and SCLC) but the regression was more prominent in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Also there were significant correlation between the SUVmax and p53 % values in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma but not in SCLC. Objective: The presence of epidermotropism in metastatic skin melanoma is well-known, leading occasionally to confusion with a new primary melanoma. In lung melanomas, it has been proposed that the presence of malignant melanocytes within the bronchial epithelium is possibly an indication of primary disease. The aim of this study was to examine whether metastatic malignant melanocytes to the lung retain the ability of \"epidermotropism\" in the adjacent normal bronchial epithelium. Method: We examined formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from four cases of metastatic melanoma to the lung (three superficial spreading and one desmoplastic) and one primary squamous cell lung carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed using S-100, Melan-A and HMB-45 antibodies. Results: Microscopic examination revealed the presence of atypical intraepithelial cells in bronchi adjacent to the tumour in all three cases of metastatic superficial spreading melanoma. These cells were present focally, had similar morphology to the neoplastic melanocytes and were positive for S-100, Melan-A and HMB45. Intraepithelial melanocytes were not found in the cases of metastatic desmoplastic melanoma and squamous cell lung carcinoma. Conclusion: Malignant melanocytes retain the ability of \"epidermotropism\" in metastatic sites in the lung, therefore their presence within the bronchial epithelium is not a proof of primary site.",

The aim of this study was to present the role of parenchymal lung macrophages in postcontusional pulmonary alterations. Method: Fifteen male Wistar albino rats underwent pulmonary contusion by dropping a weight of 500 g from a height of 45 cm (2.2 Jenergy) to the left lateral thoracic wall. The animals were divided in three groups based on the time of autopsy: 24th, 48th and 72nd h after blunt chest trauma. Lung tissue samples were evaluated by light microscopy. Immunohistochemistry staining for macrophages was performed using the anti-CD-68 monoclonal antibody. Positive to CD-68 cells were counted in ten visual fields (40x). Results: At the 24thh there were observed presence of the hemorrhages, atelectasis, and accumulation of neutrophils in the lung parenchyma. Lung edema with massive infiltration of macrophages (interstitial and alveolar) was the prominent histological findingat the 48thh. Proliferation of the fibroblast was visualized at the 72ndh. The quantity of the macrophages in traumatized lung had increased with the time with peak at 72nd h. Conclusion: This experimental study confirms that pulmonary contusion is a progressive lesion. It induces an invasion of mononuclear cells into the traumatized lung, which we consider to be responsible for the postcontusional lung alterations. Objective: Primary adenoid cystic carcinoma is very rare type of carcinoma, representing less than 1 % of respiratory tract malignancies. Method: We present a 61-year-old female patient with previous history of dyspnea and chest pain. Bronchoscopy revealed the lobular tumour measuring 40 mm in proximal trachea, which obstructed 70 % of its lumen. During bronchoscopy transbronchial needle aspiration was performed, and material was observed cytologically and histopathologically. Results: Clusters of small cells with intercellular non-fibrillar hyaline matrix and extracellular hyaline globules were seen in the cytological findings highlighted by May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain. It was suspect to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma. Histomorphological characteristics showed mixed cribriform and tubular pattern of growth, with moderately uniform small cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and round hyperchromatic nuclei, making pseudo-cystic spaces with hyaline PAS positive eosinophilic basal membrane and material in lumen of spaces. Cuboid ductal cells were surrounding small cells. In immunohistochemical studies, small cells were p63 positive and ductal cells showed positive for EMA. Final diagnosis according to clinical and pathological findings was primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of trachea. Conclusion: Cytological diagnosis of rare adenoid cystic carcinoma of trachea can mimic pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma and carcinoma. Definitive diagnosis must be confirmed by histopathological findings before classification and therapy. Objective: To determine the most common histotype of lung cancer and the main clinical signs of lung cancer, in Albanian population. Method: Retrospective study, from january 2011 up to december 2014, analyzing all histopathologic reports, and other data of the patients hospitalized in the university Hospital of lung diseases in Tirana. Methods used, were Pearson Chi-Square and Likehood-Ratio. Results: Male to female ratio was 81 %(n = 878) to 19 %(n = 206). Age range was (16-91) with mean age 62,4 years SD \u00b1 9,1. Spreading according to histotypes was: 36 % Squamous cell carcinoma, 32 % Adenocarcinoma, 15 % Small cell carcinoma, and 17 % others. 67 % of them have been smokers. Clinical symptoms were: hemoptysis 29 %(n = 315), cough 27 %(n = 293), dyspnea 23 %(n = 249), and chest pain 22 %(n = 227) . Day hospital avarage was 7 day, and day range (1-31) with SD \u00b1 6.4. Performance status was: 60.2 % improved, 35.2 % idem, 3.3 % dead in hospital. Conclusion: Squamous cell carcinoma is the main histotype of lung cancer in Albanian people. Most of these patients come in late stage of diseases, so in this condition a substantial portion of lung cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control and the use of early dedection tests. . IPH is a rare disease of children and young persons characterized with recurrent pulmonary hemorrhages of unknown cause, diffuse radiologic abnormalities, cough, haemoptysis and moderate to severe hypochromic anemia. Results: We present 2 cases of fulminant form of IPH. Case 1 -44 years old man admitted to the Hospital with severe respiratory and heart failure without any history of previous diseases. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation he died in half an hour. The postmortem examination revealed diffuse pulmonary hemorrhages and oedema of the lungs. Histologically the only findings are interstitial and intraalveolar hemorrhages, hemosiderosis, destruction of the elastic fibers in the alveolar walls and interstitial fibrosis. No significant pathologic changes in other organs were discovered. Case 2-18 years old soldier was found dead in the morning in the sleeping room. He has not any history or previous diseases. At autopsy the only findings were diffuse pulmonary hemorrhages. Conclusion: The diagnosis of both cases was made after exclusion of toxic infection injuries, thromboembolism, mitral stenosis, vasculitis, thrombocytopenia and immune complexes diseases as lupus erythematosus and Good Pasture syndrome.",

The patient was 68 year old male who presented with thoracic pain and bloody sputum. Method: Chest CT revealed a two separated tumour masses. The largest one, 85 mm in diameter, involved mediastinal structures with consecutive tracheal dislocation, and other mass at periphery of the right upper lobe, 50 mm in diameter. Abdominal CT revealed no lesions in other sites. Right superior lobectomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy was performed. Majority of mediastinal tumour mass was inaccessible for complete resection. Results: Histology showed a tumour composed of polygonal large cells with clear cytoplasm and large atypical nuclei, coarse chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The tumour cells were arranged in solid sheets and rare abortive gland formation. Immunostaining showed that tumour cells express: pankeratin, AFP, focally HepPar-1 and HCG. The differential diagnosis included: poorly differentiated hepatoid carcinoma of the lung and yolk-sac tumour. Postoperative level of serum AFP was elevated (1762 ng/ml).

A CT-guided biopsy taken from paramediastinal/lung revealed a tumour consisting of two components: a tubular epitheloid and mesenchymal population. Because of a dominating spindle cell component and the primarily lacking preexisting lung parenchyma in the biopsy, the tumour could not be classified exactly in spite of TTF1 positivity of the tubular component in the biopsy, nor potential semimalignant behavior could be excluded. Lobectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. Comparative immunostainis of biopsy and resection specimen. Results: Intraoperatively the tumour was clearly situated in lung parenchyma and sharply circumscribed. Preliminary diagnosis was sclerosing pneumocytoma, which was excluded because of lack of TTF1 positivity of the stromal component and lack of sclerosis and papillae. Final diagnosis was alveolar adenoma of the lung in the resected right upper lobe. There were some unusual details: only little cyst-formation in the center of the tumour, strong immunopositivity for CD34 and CD10 of the stromal cells. This stromal component was the reason for further differential reflections in the biopsy: solitary fibrous tumour, which was excluded by histomorphology in the resection specimen and adenoleiomyomatous hamartoma, which should express smooth muscle actin and is not expected to be as homogeneousely arranged as this tumour.",

Objective: Most of patients with lung carcinoma are inoperable, thus, the diagnosis relies on small tissue biopsy (oligobiopsy) and cytologic smears. The aim was to compare the phenotype in poorly differentiated non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) present in oligobiopsies and in surgical resection samples. Method: The postoperative tissue material of poorly differentiated NSCLC was obtained from 123 patients, however, only in 39 cases a tissue from surgical resection was available. Squamous cell carcinomas amounted to 46 % of studied tumours followed by adenocarcinomas (24 %), large cell (14 %) and adenosquamous carcinomas (5 %). The rare histological subtypes and mixed carcinomas made the remaining 11 %. The histopathological diagnosis was based on the routine hematoxylin & eosin staining. Results: The results of immunohistochemical stainings (IHC) in the whole tissue sections and oligobiopsies were compared by means of statictical parameters. The analysis is shown in the Table 1 . Conclusion: The results in whole tissue sections showed high concordance with IHC staining in oligobiopsies. The highest compliance was found for CK7 and CK5/6, whereas the lowest for TTF1, Napsin A and mucin stainings. The immunohistochemical phenotype of small oligobiopsies correlates with the profile presented by the whole tissue sections. The project was supported by National Science Centre UMO 2011/01/N/NZ4/01710. Objective: Terminal Respiratory Unit (TRU) inflammation has been recognized as a carcinogenic pool for bronchial-pulmonary carcinomas after adult stem cells carcinogenesis. An immunohistochemical study was developed to verify the behavior of TRU epithelial cells in bronchiolitis. Method: A series of surgical biopsies concerning broncholitis classified as Chronic Bronchiolitis (CB) -11 cases, considering lymphocytic infiltrate along with smooth muscle cells hyperplasia; 15 cases of Respiratory Broncholites (RB) and 14 cases of Broncholitis Obliterans (BO), was compared with preserved morphology (BPM)-5 cases, obtained after surgical drainage of spontaneous pneumothorax due to heterogeneous infant pleural scars. The immunohistochemical panel considered TTF1, CK5.6.18, and vimentin was applied to all cases. Results: The BPM cases presented TTF1 expression and negativity for vimentin and CK5.6.18 had 1 positive case. Vimentin and CK5.6.18 basal / epithelial cells expression was correlated progressively with BO, CB and RB, representing 8/14,4/11 and 2/15 positive cases for vimentin and 8/4, 5/11, and 7/15 positive cases for CK5.6. 18, respectively. Conclusion: These results are important to understand TRU carcinogenesis potentiality indicating bronchialization of bronchiolar epithelium, where adenosquamous carcinomas and pleomorphic carcinomas may develop: basal cell metaplasia with CK5.6.18 expression represents bronchial basal cell phenotype, maintaining TTF1 expression and epithelial-mesenchimal transition is represented by vimentin overexpression.",

Oguzsoy, F. Kabuk\u00e7uoglu * Istanbul, Turkey Abstract: Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) of the lung presents mainly in neonates, is rare in children beyond infancy, and has not been very rare in adults. Cases of CCAM have been previously described in adulthood, more often type I with multiloculated cystic lesions. We report a case of type I CCAM presenting as a single, expansive cystic mass in the middle pulmonary lobe in a 42-year-old female, revealed by persistent cough. Computed tomographic scan showed a single cyst with air fluid level, occupying the lateral segment of the lobe. The patient underwent a middle right lobectomy without complications Histologically, the cystic wall consisted of vascularized fibrous tissue lined by cuboidal or columnar respiratory epithelium with focal gland-like appearance. Rare smooth muscle bundles and elastic fibers were present. The diagnosis was CCAM, type I, according to the modified Stocker's classification. In conclusion when CCAM type I consists of a single large cyst, the differential diagnosis includes lung and bronchogenic cysts. The exact localization of the disease and the histological examination can be crucial for the correct diagnosis.",

Results: For epidermoid carcinomas, bronchial epithelium metaplasia had high CK5.6 and low p63 expression with vimentin negativity; one case had bronchial TTF1 basal cell positivity; in bronchioles, CK5.6 was relevant with lower expression of p63. In adenocarcinomas, vimentin was expressed in all cases, but not in one acinar case with desmoplastic stroma, where bronchioles expressed vimentin. Bronchial epithelium had TTF1 expression in adenocarcinomas and negativity in epidermoid carcinomas. Conclusion: As a small series, it seems that vimentin expression is relevant in adenocarcinomas carcinogenesis with TTF1 bronchial expression while in epidermoid carcinomas, CK5.6 keeps being a confident marker, relevant in bronchioles where it is usually absent.

Histologic examination showed an infiltration of eosinophils, lymphocytes and Langerhans' cells. Brown pigment deposits were observed. These cells stained with CD1a and S100 protein and did not stain with Melan A and HMB45. Conclusion: The PLCH is a rare condition. A few cases have been reported, mostly associated with smoke. In this case, a surgical biopsy was performed, which resulted in the diagnosis of PLCH based on eosinophil infiltration and positive staining for CD1a and negative for Melan A and HMB45. S-100 protein would be positive in both cases. A good clinical correlation with a qualified biopsy interpretation is decisive for the correct diagnosis. Objective: A Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is presented in a 40 year-old woman after bilateral lung transplantation for emphysema without any signs of Langerhans cells proliferation in the explanted lungs. Method: We retrospectively performed a S100 protein, CD1a and Langerin immunohistochemical analysis with no signs of Langerhans cells proliferated in her own lung tissue. We performed also a molecular profiling analysis comparing the receptor pulmonary tissue and the Langerhans cells that showed these cells were originated in receptor clones. Results: A \"de novo\" monoclonal origin in stem cells, probably from bone marrow is suggested. The reason she did not developed disease in their native lungs is unknown. Conclusion: Our case supports the view that the abnormalities that originate this kind of disease must be present in precursor dendritic cells outside the lung. A probably additive effect between tobacco antigens and local factors must be present to develop Langerhasns cell proliferation.",

Results: In most cases UIP combined with LIP was pointing to an immunologic disease. Other characteristic features were epithelioid and histiocytic granulomas, which enabled an even more specific diagnosis. Conclusion: Understanding the course of an AD is a requisite to interpret the morphology. AD with high levels of autoantibodies tend to deposit antigen-antibody complexes and activate complement. This all can be evaluated by histopathology and allows a specific diagnosis even in the absence of clinical information. Objective: The oncogenic form of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene represents a unique opportunity for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in several malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to examine the expression levels and clinical significance of ALK in a series of NSCLC samples assembled in tissue microarray (TMA). Method: We respectively reviewed 140 samples of NSCLC, including 64 (46 %) adenocarcinoma (ADC), 62 (44 %) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 14 (10 %) large cell carcinoma (LCC) for expression of ALK using immunohistochemistry, and then immunostaining patterns were correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Results: Expression of ALK showed a significant difference between SCC with ADC (P < 0.001) and LCC samples (P < 0.001). The highest level of ALK expression was found in ADC cases with poorly differentiated and high nuclear grade (P = 0.005 and P = 0.005, respectively). Also high level of expression of ALK was more often observed in ADC cases with poor prognosis compared to good prognosis (P = 0.013). Conclusion: These findings suggested that ALK can be considered as a promising target in tailoring therapy in patients with ADC of the lung.",

Other malignant tumours consisted of metastatic tumours (10.2 %), lymphoproliferative tumours (2.1 %) and mesenchymal tumours (1.5 %). Most common carcinoma subtypes were adenocarcinoma (48.0 %), squamous cell carcinoma (23.0 %) and small cell carcinoma (13.3 %). Carcinoid tumours were the only carcinoma subtype with an M/F Sex Ratio below 1 (0.7). Salivary gland tumours were the carcinoma with lowest mean age at diagnosis (45.5 years). Conclusion: The histologic repartition of lung tumours in Lebanon is similar to that in developed countries. We believe this resemblance is due to common smoking habits, known to be responsible for the increase of lung adenocarcinoma at the expense of other subtypes.",

Karaca * Tepecik Research Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Izmir, Turkey Objective: We aimed to evaluate clinical and pathologic findings of children with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) from a single center during 20 years. Method: We reviewed the 19 children with CPAM, who were diagnosed and treated between 1992 and 2011. Results: There were 9 boys (47.4 %) and 10 girls (52.6 %) with a mean age of 3.26 \u00b1 4.3 years (1 month-13 years). Most newborns were presented with respiratory distress, while there were recurrent pulmonary infections in older children. The subtype of CPAM led to surgery was type I in 4 cases (21.1 %), type II in 8 cases (42.1 %), type III in 5 cases (26.3 %); and type IV in 2 cases (10.5 %). In 13 cases (63.4 %). A 1month old child with type I CPAM had multiple lesions affected 2 lobes and only a newborn with type II CPAM, lesions located bilateral. There was no type 0 cases in this series. All cases were treated with lobectomy and there were no complications. Conclusion: In the present study, a realistic comprehensive picture of CPAM in a central children's hospital has been provided. In addition the possible reasons of its different percentages according to the current literature was discussed. Objective: Regulation of mRNA translation occurs at the initiation step requiring the interaction of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Dysregulation may lead to abnormal gene expression possibly resulting in carcinogenesis. We evaluated pulmonary cancer eIF protein expression profiles. Method: The protein expression levels of eIFs and members of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were determined by Western Blot analysis on 18 xenograft mouse models, representing the main entities of lung carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the eIF subunits 2\u03b1, 3c, 3h and 4e was performed on tissue micro arrays (TMAs), containing primary lung cancer and metastasis cases of a total of 603 patients. Results: Western Blot analysis of xenograft tumours revealed a significant up-regulation of eIF3j, 4E-BP1, Akt and phospho-Akt compared to control. We observed an expression of phospho-mTOR, eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3k, eIF4g, phospho-4b and phospho-4e-BP1 compared to no signal in controls. IHC revealed up-regulation of eIF2\u03b1, eIF3h and eIF4e as well as variable expression patterns of eIF3c. Conclusion: Our findings indicate a major contribution of eIFs to lung cancer. Specific eIF subunits are differentially expressed in various lung cancer entities potentially explaining their biological behavior linking eIFs to mTOR and other signaling cascades.

A month later the patient presented with pneumothorax to the right. A surgery was performed -a segmentectomy. Results: Macroscopic -a cavity with size 60/55/28 mm, with thick walls, inner uneven surface, with whitish deposits. Histology -a wall of cavity composed of connective tissue with massive infiltration of mononuclear cells; in the interior of the cavity -zones with \"geographical\" type necrosis; infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils in part of the necrotic zones; vasculitis.

Usually this disease is diagnosed on a small biopsy specimens and in very rare occasions -we have the possibility to have a bigger specimen. Objective: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is a rare tumour of the lung that accounts for 0.1-0.2 % of all pulmonary tumours. MEC most often arise from the parotid or submandibular salivary glands. Method: A 78-year-old female patient was found to have an abnormal shadow in the lung field. Chest CT showed a lobulated mass shadow measuring 30 mm in diameter in the trachea region. The clinical impression was malignancy. A lung biopsy of the mass was done and sent for histopathological examination. Results: Histologically, the tumour is characterized by a combination of mucus-secreting cells and squamous cells. The cells lack significant mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, and cellular necrosis. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that tumour cells were positive for PAS, with a keratin profile of CK7+, CK20-, CK5/6+, and were determined to be primary lung cancer. The Ki-67 expression was about 10 %. The diagnosis was low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Conclusion: Patients with low grade MEC generally have a good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 95 % and adjuvant treatment is considered unnecessary. However, effective treatment measures for high grade tumours have not been established and these cases reportedly have had poor prognosis. Objective: Aspergillus species are producing rare but lethal invasive mycoses. Their incidence has risen dramatically in the last decades, more than tenfold. Neutropenic patients usually have a massive infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma with high risk of vascular invasion and poor outcome, therefore prompt recognition of aspergillosis has major importance for their evolution. Method: We present three cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in HIV negative patients with neutropenia (caused by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma -two cases; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with bronchopneumonia -one case). Results: In all cases, aspergillosis was not diagnosed prior death, but it was suspected during autopsy and confirmed on microscopic examination with special stains (PAS, Grocott). All patients had pulmonary invasive lesions (mistaken for tumour lesions in first two cases and for a bacterial abscess in the third case) and died due respiratory failure and septic shock. Conclusion: This emphasizes the importance of a high level of medical suspicion for aspergillosis in immune suppressed patients, since the disease associates a very high mortality without proper treatment. It also sustains the importance of necroptic examination in patients with uncertain diagnosis to identify significant unsuspected causes of death. *Dutulescu and Pop are first authors in equal proportion.",

The histopathologic types of tumour were establish based on microscopic examination in HE stain and imunohistochemical stain. Results: Squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequent type of lung malignancy accounting for a third of the cases, followed closely by adenocarcinoma representing 27.7 %. 13 cases had positive diagnosis of malignancy both in biopsies and cytology; 4 cases were positive for malignancies in biopsies and negative in cytology while one case was diagnosed as malignant based on cytology.

Objective: Inflammatory infiltrate has a variable distribution among lung adenocarcinomas. The objective of the study was to assess tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in 10 cases of lung adenocarcinomas in relation to stromal reaction, necrosis, cyclin d1 activity and peritumoral macrophages. Method: We investigated 10 cases of lung adenocarcinoma which showed on routine hematoxylin and eosin stain the presence of TILs. Necrosis and amount of stromal reaction were taken into account. By immunohistochemistry we assessed semiquantitatively the prevalence and distribution of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes within tumour and along the invasive margins. Also, CD 68+ macrophages and cyclin d1 were evaluated. Results: We found that TILs are mainly CD3+ lymphocytes, CD8-more than CD8+, and they infiltrate stroma more than between neoplastic cells. Peripheral distribution of macrophages is common while stromal infiltration was associated with increased TILs and presence of necrosis. Cyclin d1 was positive more at the periphery of tumour. Conclusion: Tumoural margins exhibit nonspecific inflammation in adjacent tissue and increased proliferation on tumoural side. TILs present variable distribution within tumour, they appear trapped in tumoural stroma and suggest ineffective immune response.

            "text": "Objective: Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) is a rare, low to intermediate grade vascular tumour of the lung. Marked nuclear atypia, mitotic activity (>1/10 HPF), tumour necrosis and a spindle cell component predict more aggressive course. Method: We report a 54 year old male patient lung nodules presented with a clinical history of approximately 4 months of hip pain. A computed tomography of the chest showed a multinodular process involving the right upper lobe, lingula as well as additional nodules in the left lobe. Bronchoscopic biopsies were taken which did not yield a definitive diagnosis. A thoracotomy was performed. Histologically, tumour cells were arranged in clusters and trabeculae set in a fibrous to dense hyalinized and myxoid stroma. Tumour cells show moderate nuclear pleomorphism, atypical mitoses (3/10 HPF) and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Pleuropulmonary involvement, intraalveolar growth pattern, extensive lymphovascular dissemination, foci of tumour necrosis and secondary lung parenchymal infarction were present. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive results for CD31, CD34 and FLI-1. He underwent chemotherapy but died becouse of disease progression after 3 months. Conclusion: In conclusion, the diagnosis of PEH can be a diagnostic pathological challenge and must be distinguished from a variety of other benign and malignant lung disease. Objective: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumour with poor prognosis and limited treatments. To date prognostic and tailored therapeutic biomarkers are lacking. The study analyzed the expression levels of MDM2 and HIF1alpha in different histologic subtypes from chemonaive MPM patients. Method: Biopsies of MPM patients from four Italian centers were centrally analyzed. MDM2 and HIF1alpha expression levels were investigated through immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. A pathological assessment of necrosis, inflammation and proliferation index (Ki67 immunostaining) was also performed. Molecular markers, pathological features and clinical characteristics were related to overall (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Results: Sixty MPM patients were included in the study (32 epithelioid and 28 non-epithelioid). Higher levels of MDM2,HIF alpha, necrosis and proliferation index were significantly associated with sarcomatoid/ biphasic subtypes, while higher levels of inflammation were significantly associated with epithelioid subtype. MDM2 expression levels were significantly correlated with HIF1alpha, necrosis and Ki67. Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation of non-epithelioid histology, high levels of necrosis and proliferation index with shorter PFS. Conclusion: Sarcomatoid/biphasic and epithelioid mesotheliomas show different MDM2 and HIF1alpha expression levels and are characterized by different levels of necrosis, proliferation and inflammation.

            "text": "Objective: The Gleason grading system measures architectural differentiation and disregards cytological atypia (CA) and the cell proliferation index. Several studies have reported that nuclear grade and mitotic index (MI) are prognostically useful. Method: This study included 232 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. CA was determined on the basis of nucleomegali (approximately 20 \u03bcm); vesicular chromatin; prominent nucleoli (even at low power), and irregular thickened nuclear membranei. The proportion of area of CA was recorded in each tumour in 10 % increments. The MI was defined as the number of mitotic figures in 10 consecutive high-power fields (HPF). Results: In univariate analysis, significant differences included associations between failure and Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, positive surgical margin (SM), the presence of high pathologic stage, CA \u2265 10 % of tumour area, MI \u22653/10 HPF, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen. In a Cox regression model, a positive SM, the presence of a CA with \u226510 % of tumour area, and an MI of \u22653/10 HPF were independent predictors of BPR after RP. Conclusion: The results of our study showed that, in addition to the conventional Gleason grading system, CA and MI are useful prognostic parameters while evaluating long-term prognosis in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Objective: The prevalence of testicular metastasis from colon cancer has been reported to approximate 8 % of all testicular metastatic lesions. Less than 30 cases of colon metastasis to the testicle have been reported either at autopsies or as isolated case reports of advanced metastatic disease. Method: We report a case of a 58 year old man who presented with a 2 month history of a painless right testicular mass 3 years after undergoing a ileo-hemicolectomy for a stage IIIB sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. Physical examination and ultrasonography revealed a solitary testicular mass measuring 1,7 \u00d7 1 cm. A right radical orchidectomy was perfomed. Results: On microscopic examination an infiltrative adenocarcinoma was found. The tumour exhibited an interstitial growth pattern with preservation of tubules and there was vascular invasion.The immunohistochemical study showed that the tumour cells were positive for CKAE1, CKAE3, CK20 and CDX2 and negative for Vimentin, PLAP, CD30, AFP, HCG. The morphology of the tumour and the immunohistochemistry were consistent with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Testicular metastatic disease is uncommon particularly from colon cancer. Although rare, metastasis to testes should be considered as a differential diagnosis especially in older men with symptoms suggesting the present of a non-testicular malignancy.",

We considered different variables that could help us to classify them. Method: We reviewed 48 ChRCC using the following variables: size, Fuhrman grade, chromophobe tumour grade, perineural/vascular invasion, the presence of necrosis, stage, mitotic activity, programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and these findings were correlated with clinical follow-up. The presence of necrosis, increase nuclear atypia and increased mitotic activity defined the high grade. Results: 21 cases (44 %) were categorized as high grade and 27 cases (56 %) were low grade. Recurrence occurred in two patients, both of them with high grade tumour and metastases in others 2, one low grade and one high grade, the last one dying from disease. No one of these tumours appeared PD-L1 expression, only one case was positive, a high grade tumour (presence of necrosis) without adverse disease after 10 years. Conclusion: Despite the numerous grading systems proposed, in our serie of ChRCC the most useful variables that correlated with adverse outcome were the size and the presence of necrosis. Objective: Renal cell carcinoma is sometimes accompanied by a second malignancy. However, the coexistence of this neoplasm and esophageal adenocarcinoma has not yet been reported. Method: A 65-year old Caucasian female presented with gross haematuria. CT scan of the revealed around tumour 3,8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2,2 cm in the upper pole of the left kidney. Cystoscopy was normal and cytologic urine examination showed clusters of clear cells. As the patient was also complaining of difficulty in swallowing a gastroscopy was performed and a tumour of the lower esophagus was detected. Cytologic examination was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Results: The kidney neoplasm was a clear cell renal carcinoma infiltrating its capsule, but not involving the renal pelvis, the blood vessels and the ureter. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination of biopsies from the esophageal neoplasm revealed a papillary adenocarcinoma. It was surgically removed and the patient underwent adjuvant treatment for both neoplasms. After 6 months she showed no evidence of disease. Conclusion: According to the literature this case is the first one reporting the coexistence of renal cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.",

Method: A 65 year-old man presented with PSA 9.76 ng/ml with no previous history. Digital examination was negative. Prostatic needle biopsies revealed adenocarcinoma Gleason score 7. The patient underwent radical prostatectomy. Results: Microscopically prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason score 8 was diagnosed, invading both lobes, showing perineural invasion and free surgical margins. There was extracellular mucin production with mucin pools formation accounting for less than 25 %.There were also glandular structures and small isolated clusters of round to pyramidal cells with Paneth cell-like morphology containing eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. Immunohistochemistry (Chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, Serotonin) supported the neuroendocrine differentiation. Conclusion: Paneth cell-like changes are detected in 10 % of prostatic adenocarcinomas. Neuroendocrine differentiation is considered to be an unstable phenotype and its prognostic significance is controversial; the latest studies refer a favorable prognosis. Pathologists should report any neuroendocrine component in an otherwise conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma, regarding its possible association with resistance to hormone therapy and probable modulation of the therapeutic approach. It is currently thought that the degree of neuroendocrine differentiation increases in response to Androgen Deprivation Therapy, so the patient may benefit from treatment options such as Somatostatin and peptide analogs. Objective: Small cell carcinoma of the bladder represents less than 1 % all bladder primary tumours. It has an aggressive behavior and a poor prognosis. stratified squamous epithelium. These neoplastic cells showed positive immunoreactivity for CK7 and CK20, as did the cells lining the underlying cystic lesion. Conclusion: In our opinion the appearances were those of extramammary paget's disease (EMPD) of the glans penis, secondary to recurrent urothelial malignancy. EMPD is rare. The most common site for EMPD is the vulva but penis was involved in this case. In cases of male genital EMPD, usually the scrotum and penis are both affected but in this case only glans penis was involved. EMPD is less often related to underlying malignancy (15 %) compared to mammary PD. This case was related to underlying urothelial malignancy. The underlying malignancy in this case was, in our opinion, recurrent although may have been due to field-effect.",

In the era of widely accessible PSA assay, tru-cut biopsies often offer small foci suspicious for cancer that need further evaluation. Results: For a period of 5 years, a total of 842 patients were evaluated, 67 % were diagnosed with PC and 33 % had benign finding. Of these patients, only 28 (3.3 %) fulfill the requisites of minimal PC according to the published criteria. Age varies between 52 and 85, PSA level -4.3 to above 100 nmol / ml. After strict application of histological criteria, in 7 (25 %) of the patients the diagnosis of cancer was rendered without additional immunohistochemical (IHC) study. In the remaining group, PC was signed-out only after a standard panel of IHC was applied -p63, HMWC and AMACR, with or without ERG. Gleason grade was asssigned to each case, complemented by Ki67 proliferative activity to provide additional information on the clinical significance of the process. Conclusion: Diagnosis of minimal PC is a challenge in biopsy practice due to limited amount of tissue and wide variety of imitators, requiring additional evaluation by IHC.

On gross examination, tumour was on the lateral part of the kidney measuring 4,2 \u00d7 4, \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 cm with extensive necrosis and hemorrhage. Method: Histological sections have been assessed using hematoxylin-eosin stain. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for following antibodies: CK7, CK20, vimentin, RCC, CD10, TTF-1, Ki-76, CD3 and CD20. Results: Histological examination revealed fibrovascular papillae covered by atypical epithelial cells with large nuclei, prominent nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The stalks of the papillae were infiltrated with abundant CD3 and CD20 positive lymphocytes, forming secondary follicles with germinative centers. Extensive hemorrhage and necrosis were found. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were vimentin and CD 10 uniformly positive, CK7 was focally strongly positive, CK20 focally weakly positive, TTF-1 and RCC were negative. The proliferation index using the Ki-67 was 35 %. Conclusion: PRCC may have various histological appearances; including tumour associated acute and chronic inflammation.

            "text": "Method: Gene expression array was performed in three cases of clear cell renal carcinoma, three oncocytomas and five non-neoplastic renal tissues. To verify microarray data, we performed RT-PCR in 14 new cases of several renal neoplasms. Results: 610 genes were significantly overexpressed in carcinomas, and 264 in oncocytomas. Cell cycle, signal transduction, extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and apoptosis were the main biological processes affected in carcinomas. On the other hand, 586 sequences were downregulated in carcinomas, 397 in oncocytomas, including signal transduction and cell cycle control related genes. Uromodulin expression was lost in every kind of renal neoplasms but not in papillary. Otherwise, expression of Plexin B1 is repressed in CCRCC, chromophobe and papillary renal carcinomas. Conclusion: Oncocytomas and carcinomas presents different molecular pathways, although some changes, like angiogenesis or immunological response are similar. Plexin B1 and Uromodulin could be useful targets for the development of new in vitro diagnosis and therapeutical methods. Objective: Leydig cell tumours are the most common sex cord-stromal tumours of the testis. The aim of this paper is to report a series of Leydig cell tumours diagnosed in our center in a period of 23 years. Method: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of testicular Leydig cell tumours diagnosed between 1991 and 2014. Results: Three patients with Leydig cell tumours were diagnosed. The patient's age was 36, 78 and 37 years respectively. The main symptoms/ signs were: scrotal mass (all cases) and gynecomastia (one patient). Hormonal profile was performed in two patients. Tumour diameter was 15 mm, 67 mm and 110 respectively. Pathological examination confirmed benign Leydig cell tumour in the first case and Leydig cell tumour with histological criteria for malignancy in the second case. The third case, with some particular or atypical clinical and histological features (nuclear pleomorphism, multinodularity, abundant lipochrome pigment, necrosis, inflammation, fibrosis, calcification, osseous and adipose metaplasia) was signed out as testicular \"tumour\" of the adrenogenital syndrome in a 37 years-old patient having two brothers known with adrenogenital syndrome. All cases were managed surgically (orchidectomy). Conclusion: Leydig cell tumours of the testis are very rare tumours that can be challenging from pathological point of view, especially in the absence of clinical information. Objective: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in angiogenesis being expressed in many solid tumours, including prostate cancer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of VEGF in prostate carcinoma. Method: Immunohistochemical expression of VEGF was analyzed on three groups, each of 20 primary diagnosed prostate carcinomas: localized, locally advanced and with distant metastases. For each tumour was determined the VEGF staining score taking into account the percentage of VEGF -positive cells and the staining intensity. Cases with staining score \u2264 3.37 were considered to have low staining score, and those with score > 3.37 high staining score. The relationships between VEGF expression and some pathological factors were analyzed.",

Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry is a useful tool for diagnosing urothelial cancers and the recognition of types and subtypes of urothelial cancer has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Objective: To investigate the correlation between lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and immunohistochemical expression of two frequently routinely applied markers, Ki-67 and E-cadherin, in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUTUC). Method: The specimens from 106 patients with UUTUC who had undergone nephroureterectomy were analyzed for pathologic parameters and LVI, while Ki-67 and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Ki-67 was overexpressed in 38 % of the cases, while 45 % of tumours demonstrated aberrant E-cadherin staining. The presence of LVI was associated with high grade, advanced stage, solid growth, nodular invasion pattern, high Ki-67 labeling index and altered E-cadherin expression. In logistic regression model analysis, besides the non-papillary tumour architecture and nodular invasion pattern (p < 0.05, respectively), only Ki-67 expression was found to improve the prediction of LVI in UUTUC (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that Ki-67 overexpression is an independent predictor of LVI in UUTUC, indicating the progression of the disease. E-cadherin staining adds no valuable information to LVI probability assessment. Patients with Ki-67 overexpression, especially in nonpapillary tumours, should be monitored more closely after surgery. Objective: Lymphoma presenting as a renal mass can occur in two settings. Secondary renal lymphomas (SRL) in the case of systemic diffuse lymphomas, and primary renal localized lymphomas (PRL) without systemic manifestations. Less than 100 of cases of PRL have been described. It is defined as a localized lymphoma arising primarily in the renal parenchyma, with no invasion from any adjacent extrarenal mass and without evidence of systemic involvement. The pathogenesis of primary renal lymphoma is poorly understood, as the renal has not usually lymphoid tissue. We present two PRLs. Method: We have search our database looking for renal lymphomas from 1995 until 2015 excluding those with systemic disease at presentation. Results: First case is a 60 years old man with a renal mass that was resected with diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma who disseminated rapidly. He died 8 months later of adriamicine cardiotoxicity but without evidence of active disease. The second case is an 81 years old woman with follicular lymphoma, alive 7 months later without systemic involvement. Conclusion: PRL are extremely rare but can be found in nephrectomy specimens. Prognosis is dependent of histologic type. Objective: Prostate inflammation is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. In the present study, we immunohistochemically examined the infiltration patterns of CD204 and CD3 positive cells in areas of benign hyperplasia, intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma of the prostate and correlated these variables with ERG expression and rearrangement status. Method: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples were obtained from 100 patients with prostate cancer who had undergone radical prostatectomy and prior examination for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. We assessed the number of infiltrating CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD204+ macrophages in benign, premalignant and malignant foci and analyzed the relationship with expression and fusion of ERG. Results: CD204+ macrophages infiltrated malignant areas to a greater extent than those of benign glands. The same trend was also shown by CD3 lymphocytes. The response of both cellular types was dependent on ERG expression status and on the fusion gene TMPRSS2-ERG. Patients with gene fusion and genome rearrangement as well as higher expression of ERG had significantly higher infiltration of carcinoma tissue by CD3+ a CD204+ cells. Conclusion: The greater abilitiy of inflammatory cells with CD3+ and CD204+ phenotype to infiltrate malignant and premaligant regions in the prostate may be a consequence of immune reaction against tumourous cells but according to recent data this could bes a manifestation of immune tolerance and tumour promotion. Objective: Smooth muscle tumours of the scrotum are very uncommon, and those with degenerative-appearing atypia, variably designated as \"atypical,\" \"symplastic,\" or \"bizarre\" leiomyomas, are extremely rare with only 20 cases in the literature. Because of their rarity, the diagnostic criteria and prognosis of symplastic leiomyomas are not well established. Method: We describe one case of scrotal symplastic leiomyoma and compare their histopathologic characteristics to usual leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma of the scrotum. Results: Our patient was 68 years-old. Surgical excision was performed with the preoperative diagnosis of paratesticular tumour The tumoural size was 6 \u00d7 5,5 \u00d7 4,2 cm. Histologically showed histological features of leiomyoma with striking nuclear atypia and low mitotic activity. Conclusion: Symplastic leiomyomas, despite the presence of nuclear atypia, share histologic features with usual leiomyomas including small size, low cellularity, lack of mitotic activity, and low Ki67 proliferation rate. Degenerative nuclear atypia, including large pleomorphic nuclei, yet with hyperchromatic smudgy chromatin, was the defining feature of symplastic leiomyomas. All tumours described are relatively small with a mean size of 1 cm but our case is notable for its size. It is important to establish the diagnostic criteria and the differential diagnosis with leiomyosarcoma.",

In this study, the histopathological findings of nine cases are described. Method: Nine cases diagnosed as sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder between 2004 and 2014 were reviewed for histopathological characteristics of the epithelial and sarcomatous components. Results: All of the patients were male with a mean age of 71 years old (range 52-79 years). Sarcomatous components of the tumours were characterized by poorly differentiated spindle or pleomorphic tumour cells. One case showed focal heterologous chondroid elements. Carcinomatous components were urothelial carcinoma (n = 4), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 2), urothelial carcinoma combined with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1), and urothelial carcinoma in situ (n = 1). In one case sarcomatoid carcinoma diagnosis was made depending on CK7 positivity. Lymphovascular invasion and perineural invasion were seen in 5 and 2 cases respectively. All of the cases were invasive, including stages of pT1 (n = 1), pT2 (n = 3), pT3 (n = 3), pT4 (n = 2). Conclusion: Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder is an aggressive disease which majority of the cases are presented at an advanced stage. The sarcomatous component is most commonly characterized by high grade spindle and pleomorphic cells. The epithelial component is predominantly composed of urothelial carcinoma followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Objective: Secondary tumours of the urinary bladder are rare, less than 2 % of all bladder neoplasms. The urinary bladder is secondarily involved by a wide spectrum of malignancies. Colon, prostate, rectum and cervix are the most common primary tumours, involving the bladder by direct extension. Stomach, skin, lung and breast are the most common primary sites in distant metastases. As it is an uncommon finding, we reviewed our hospital's cases in order to better characterize this entity. Method: We reviewed, in our autopsy and biopsy series, all cases of tumours involving the bladder from 1996 to 2014. Results: We found 41 cases, 6 autopsies (14.63 %) and 35 biopsies (85.37 %). Colon was the primary site most frequently involved (48.78 %), followed by rectum (12.20 %), prostate (14.63 %) , endometrium (7.32 %), skin (7.32 %), stomach (2.44 %), uterine cervix (2.44 %), Fallopian tube (2.44 %) and esophagus (2.44 %). Conclusion: Bladder metastases are a rare finding. Differential diagnosis between these tumours and bladder carcinomas can be difficult. A proper clinical history and histological correlation can help in the correct interpretation of bladder metastasis, as immunohistoquemistry plays a limited role. Our findings are in agreement with the literature, except for a higher rate of Fallopian tube and esophagus metastases.",

We investigated the relationship between the recurrence rate and the expressions of various genes via immunohistochemical analysis in order to assess their applicability as prognostic factors for clinical behavior and differential diagnosis. Method: We used P53, bcl-2, Ki-67, CK20 and P16 for 58 cases diagnosed with primary superficial bladder cancer. Results: Recurrence was detected in 62.1 % of the cases. Progression to a higher grade tumour was detected in 38.9 % of the 36 cases that showed recurrence. A marked statistically significant relationship was found between recurrence and diffuse or no staining with CK20, more than 50 % heterogeneous expression with P16, and more than 1 % expression with bcl-2. A significant relationship was found between the pathological stage and histological grade of the cases and the CK 20 and Ki 67 expressions. Conclusion: In conclusion, determining CK20, bcl-2, and p16 expressions with immunohistochemical methods can provide guidance in predicting the recurrence of superficial bladder tumours. Abnormal CK20 staining and Ki-67 expression is related to tumour grade and can be used to support the diagnosis in controversial cases.",

The present study aims to evaluate the prognostic significance of tumour budding in urothelial carcinoma of bladder (UCB). Method: A total of 60 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive UCB were included in the study. Tumour budding was defined as positive in the presence of small clusters ( < 5 cells and >1 cells) of tumour cells identified at the invasive margin. Results: The mean age of patients was 65.6, of whom 52 were males and 8 were females. Twenty-seven patients were alive, 33 were dead. The histologic type was pure urothelial carcinoma. Of the tumours 11 were stage II, 18 were stage III, 31 were stage IV. The number of cases with absent, mild, moderate and marked scores of budding were 8, 18, 13, 21, respectively. Overall survival for budding scores absent, mild, moderate and marked were 40, 29, 30 and 19 months, respectively. No statistically significant relationship was found between tumour budding and overall survey (p = 0.14). Conclusion: Although there was no statistical significant correlation of budding with survival, presence and intense of budding had a trend to an adverse impact on survival. Objective: The incidence of testicular germ-tumours presents a remarkable geographical range. The highest level of incidence (8-10/100000 young-age population) was met in industrialized countries. Researches regarding the causes of appearance of testicular tumours were guided by their beginning assumptions since intrauterine life and consist differentiate abnormal fetal-primordial germ-cell populations. Method: It distinguish that embryonic carcinoma metastases can differentiate to other testicular tumours in over 8 % cases. Embryonal carcinomas cells express PLAP in 85-95 % cases, focal expression and less marked than seminomas. Retrospective study (patients were diagnosed in Constanta ECC-Hospital) examines the techniques of immunohistochemistry and morphometry in histopathological diagnosis of certainity in ambiguous cases. Results: Embryonal carcinoma is the most undifferentiated testicular malignant tumour, composed of large cells, with different architectural aspects. It can occur in pure form or as a frequent component of mixed germ tumours. Embryonic carcinoma is a risk factor for relapse malignant germinal testicular tumours.",

Results: A 71-year-old male underwent transurethral resection of the bladder and prostate which were diagnosed as high grade urothelial carcinoma (pT4; prostatic invasion). No lymph node involvement or metastatic tumour was detected. Because he rejected surgery, he was treated with chemoradiotherapy. One year later, he presented with a palpable right testicular mass. No other recurrent tumour was present in the bladder at that time. A right orchiectomy was performed. Gross and microscopic examination revealed pleomorphic tumoural infiltration with entrapped seminifer tubules within the tumour and widespread lymphovascular invasion. Immunohistochemical findings (positive for HMWCK and CK 7; negative for PLAP and CD30) and morphological features were consistent with urothelial carcinoma metastasis. Conclusion: Metastases from bladder urothelial carcinoma to the testis are very rare and usually found on autopsy of patients with advanced disease. Our case is a rare example of metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder to the testis presented with a clinically palpable testicular mass. Metastatic testicular tumours may mimic primary germ cell tumours. Patients' age and medical history are helpful features that should be sought after.",

The aim of this study was to estimate karyometric variables and Ki-67 index of squamous dysplasia and squamous cell lung carcinoma. Method: At Institute of Pathology of Ni\u0161, formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded bronchoscopic mucosal samples from 10 patients with moderate squamous dysplasia and 10 patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma were retrieved from pulmonary pathology archives. Serial histologic sections of 4 \u03bcm thickness were prepared for staining with hematoxilin and eosin and analyzed using image analysis system ImageJ. Immunohistochemical staining was performed by streptavidin-biotin method, and Ki-67 activity was quantified with plugin Cell counter. Results: All measured nuclear variables: nuclear area, Feret diameter and perimeter were found to be significantly different between squamous dysplasia and squamous cell lung carcinoma (p < 0.01). The values of nuclear variables of squamous cell carcinoma were significantly larger than in squamous dysplasia. Similarly, Ki-67 index was significantly larger in squamous cell lung carcinoma compared to moderate dysplasia",

In our study, we applied Ki-67 to NE tumour cases and correlate mitotic activity and Ki-67 index. Method: We reviewed the clinical data of 59 patients who underwent complete resection (31 typical carcinoid tumour (CT), 3 atypical CT, 19 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), 6 small cell carcinoma (SCC)) and analyzed Ki-67 proliferation index. Other immunohistochemical (synaptophysin, chromogranin and TTF-1) and clinicopathological (diameter, mitosis, necrosis, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis) features were also reviewed. Results: Ki-67 proliferation index was 1.4 \u00b1 2.3 in CTs whereas the index was 72.8 \u00b1 19.9 in high grade NE carcinomas (p < 0,001). The mean Ki-67 indices in the typical CT, atypical CT, LCNEC and SCC were respectively 0.9 \u00b1 1.1, 9.0 \u00b1 1.4, 68.9 \u00b1 20.8 and 84.8 \u00b1 10.2. The difference between typical and atypical CT and also between atypical CT and LCNEC were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Statistically, the results of mitotic indices of four NE tumour subtypes were similarly significant. Conclusion: Although Ki-67 is not part of the current WHO diagnostic criteria for classifying pulmonary NE tumours",

Biopsies of the bladder were examined by histomorphologically and immunohistochemically. Results: Both of two tumours included marked pleomorphism, aggregates or sheet of mononucleated and multinucleated giant cells, high mitotic counts, multifocal necrosis and focal minimally squamous differentiation. Tumours were positive with CK7, CKAE1/AE3 (pancytokeratin) and EMA but negative with CK20, p63, inhibin, \u03b2-HCG, PLAP, and Melan-A. Tumours were reported as pleomorfic giant cell carcinoma of urinary bladder. Conclusion: Pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma is a rare aggressive variant of urothelial carcinoma with appearance similar to giant cell carcinoma of the the lung and rarely the pancreas, prostate, gallbladder and intestine. It has been mentioned in the 2004 WHO classification of urinary bladder tumours but fully described in 2009 by Lopez-Beltran",

Results: Varicose ISV demonstrated a media wall thickening with alternating segments of atrophy and hyperplasia. Nuclear immunostaining for Caspase 9 was significantly higher in the tunica media of ISV compared to controls (p < 0.0001) Few cases exhibited higher expression for Caspase 8 while Bcl-2 was not detected in any specimen. MMP-1 and TIMP-1 cytoplasmic immunostaining was significantly higher in ISV (p < 0.0001). MMP-9 expression was limited to ISV smooth muscle cells only.

Method: The study was conducted on 44 cases of CC-RCC. The tissue fragments underwent standard processing procedures for immunohistochemical examination, using anti-E-cadherin antibody. The E-cadherin expression was assessed by using a combined score, based on percentage of positive tumoural cells and intensity of immunoreaction. Results: Tumoural areas were characterized by a low expression of E cadherin, reflecting the loss of cell polarity. From the study group, 16 histologic grade of tumour. We also noted the presence of Ecadherin in distal and collecting tubules in normal kidney adjacent to the tumoural areas. Conclusion: The role of adhesion molecules in CC-RCC is still controversial",

We report a rare case of a SCC of the penile urethra that was negative for a variety of cytokeratin cocktails and positive for PAX5. Method: A 73 year-old man presented with a painful mass protruding through the urethral meatus. Preoperative studies revealed the presence of inguinal lymph nodes metastases, but no other evidence of disease. The patient underwent a total penectomy.

Standard endoscopic and histopathological prognostic parameters are insufficient. Some molecular parameters such as Beta-catenin, an adhesion protein, are recently described contributing to a more precise assessment of tumour's behavior. We aim to evaluate Beta-catenin immunostaining as a prognostic factor for recurrence and progression in NMIBC. Method: Series of 40 patients with NMIBC was recorded between 2008 and 2013. Immunohistological staining for Beta-catenin was evaluated. Chisquared test was used to evaluate the association between Beta-Catenin expression and recurrence/progression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate recurrence-free (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS)",

Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human High Molecular Weight Cytokeratin (HMWCK), Clone 34\u03b2E12, p63 -clone p63-DAK and anti-Human Monoclonal Alpha Methyl Acyl Coenzyme A racemate (AMACR) -atrophy, negative in 17 cases of atrophy and positive in adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical assessment of basal cell was useful in proving the benign nature of atrophic lesions and AMACR immunostaining alone was not sufficiently discriminatory in the differential diagnosis of prostate atrophy with adenocarcinoma.

The same genes were analyzed in androgen-deprived and control LNCaP cells. Results: Three genes were significantly up-modulated (WNT-11 and AR) or down-modulated (PDEF) in ADT+ vs ADT-cases, as well as in androgen deprived LNCaP cells. The effect of ADT on CgA gene upmodulation was almost exclusively detected in cases positive for the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion. The correlation between bioptic and surgical samples was poor for all genes tested. Gene expression analysis of separate tumour areas from the same patient showed an extremely heterogeneous profile in all 6 untreated cases tested. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that ADT induces relevant transcriptional modifications",

A 6 cm mass at upper-pole of left kidney was identified. Case#2 was a 57 year-old female with incidentally encountered 7.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 4 cm left renal tumour during ultrasonography. Results: Both tumours were located clearly within kidney parenchyma microscopically. They were characterized by nests, cords, and strands of epithelioid cells within dense hyalinized-collagenized stroma. The renal tubules entrapped within the tumour exhibited focal papillary hyperplasia, mimicking malignant mixed epithelial stromal tumour (MEST) of kidney. EMA, bcl2, CD99 and TLE1 (weak) positivity in one case suggested possible diagnosis of synovial sarcoma. Both tumours strongly expressed MUC4 and showed EWSR1-CERB3L1 translocation by FISH, consistent with the diagnosis of SEF. Conclusion: Herein we report 2 cases of primary renal SEF, showing features identical to those in conventional locations. Renal SEF should be distinguished from malignant MEST and synovial sarcoma",

Because of its late presentation and poor prognosis, there is need for increased awereness of this under-recognized variant of bladder carcinoma. A correct histological diagnosis is critical for optimal therapeutic approaches. Method: An 75-year-old male presented with gross hematuria, due to bladder tumour. A TURBT was performed. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue was examined with histology and immunohistochemistry. Results: Microscopically, a high-grade urothelial carcinoma, characterized by discohesive cells with plasmacytoid appearance was revealed",

Miladinovic * KBC Zemun, Dept. of Pathology, Belgrade, SerbiaObjective: Onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection caused by nematode Onchocerca volvulus which is transmitted by the bite of black fly (genus Simulium). Onchocerciasis is a chronic multisystem disease with dermatologic, ocular and systemic manifestation.The adult worms elicit a strong granulomatous response known as onchocercoma. Method: A 77 year old man was admitted to the Clinical Hospital Center Zemun because of the presence of a tumour on the left lateral side of the nose. Results: Macroscopic examination showed the presence of an oval subcutaneous nodule, 14 mm in diameter, with normal overlying skin. Histological examination revealed a granulomatous inflammatory nodule in the reticular dermis, and on the border between the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Adult worms of O. volvulus were identified within the center of the nodule, surrounded by numerous eosinophils and lymphocytes. The uteri of female adult O.volvulus worms contained eggs and microfilariae. Conclusion: Onchocerciasis is known to be endemic in 37 countries throughout West and Central Africa, Central and South America, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It is estimated that 17-18 million persons worldwide are infected with O. volvulus, the vast majority of whom live in Africa (about 90 %).

Method: Description of activities undertaken -collaboratively and internationally. Results: The Eurocytology website was originally developed with Leonardo funding in 2005-7. The Czech Society for Clinical Cytology became an official partner in the second phase 2013-2015 targeting on updated content with more languages including Czech and a new dynamic website/training platform. All current modules of the former website have been translated and incorporated into the curricula for cytotechnology and cytopathology education. Prague hosted in September 2014 the international working session. The Czech partners have reviewed the updated chapters of gynecology cytology by Amanda Herbert. The details of the platform are disseminated during national cytology and pathology congresses, workshops and seminars. The feedback from the website users proves increasing interest among the specialists. Due to lack of a language barrier the Czech language version may serve Slovak colleagues tutorials as well. Conclusion: The updated website www.eurocytology.eu increases the level of cytopathology education in the Czech Republic.

Kouraklis * General Hospital Athens, 3rd Surgical Dept., Paiania -Attiki, GreeceObjective: p53 is a tumour suppressor protein, negatively regulated by murine double minute 2 protein (MDM2). This study aimed to present their significance in ampullary adenocarcinomas and demonstrate possible connections with tumour grade, disease stage and histological type of differentiation. Method: Forty-seven consecutively resected ampullary adenocarcinomas, 18 intestinal and 29 pancreatobiliary type, were immunohistochemically stained against p53 and MDM2. Results: Differentiation was poor in six and well/moderate in 41. Stage (TNM) was 0 in two patients, I in two, II in 16 and III in 27. p53 was expressed in nine intestinal (50 %) and eight pancreatobiliary (27.6 %). Fifteen intestinal (83.3 %) and 20 pancreatobiliary (69 %) expressed MDM2. There were no statistically significant differences in the expression of p53 and MDM2 between intestinal and pancreatobiliary type. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of p53 in predicting intestinal type were 50, 72 and 53 % while these of MDM2 were 83, 31 and 43 %, respectively. Neither MDM2 nor p53 expression correlated with tumour grade and disease stage. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical expression of MDM2 and p53 in ampullary carcinomas is not predictive of the histological type and is not associated with the biological behavior of the tumour.PS-08-029 Clinicopathological features and prognostic factors of gastric cancer D.

The aim of this research was to examine the correlation between Klf4 expression and these phenotypes and clinicopathologic characteristics of GC. Method: A total of 78 cases of gastric cancer were analyzed for immunohistochemical expression of MUC5AC, MUC2, CD10 and Klf4. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS 15.0. Results: MUC5Ac expression was detected in 69.2 %, MUC2 in 30.8 % and CD10 in 15.4 % of analyzed tumours. Based on MUC5AC, MUC2 and CD10 expression, 42 tumours were classified as gastric type, 15 as mixed, 13 as intestinal and 8 as unclassified. Aberrant Klf4 expression was found in 84.6 % of the cases. Gastric phenotype was significantly associated with altered Klf4 expression (p = 0.023). Conclusion: Our results suggest an important role of Klf4 transcription factor in differentiation of gastric mucosa epithelial cells and indicate its potential significance in more accurate diagnostic and prognostic stratification of the patients with GC.

Staniceanu * Universitary Colentina Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: Mast cells (MCs) are considered as important players in neoplasia, current concern being to determine if their role is pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic. This study, correlating the presence of MCs with gastric neoplasia in Helicobacter pylori (HP) positive and negative patients, brings new data supporting the hypothesis that MCs have a protective role. Method: We performed a retrospective case-control study including 30 gastric surgical samples with gastric neoplasia and 30 surgical samples with non-tumoural gastric lesions. Half of the patients in each group had HP infection. Giemsa and tryptase stains were used for quantitative evaluation of MCs in one area for the control group and in three areas for case group: intratumoral, peritumoral and normal mucosa. Results: Presence of HP does not influence the number of MCs in tumoural and non-tumoural cases. MCs were significantly increased in tumoural microenvironment and significantly decreased in the normal distant mucosa comparative with control group (p = 0.0005). Conclusion: MCs are distributed as a collar around the tumour. Their significant decrease in the normal distant mucosa supports the fact that they are part of immune anti-tumoural host response, mobilized to limit tumoural evolution.

Fayzullina * Research Center for Obstetrics, Dept. of Pathology, Moscow, RussiaObjective: Papillary tubal hyperplasia (PTH) is accompanied with detached rounded clusters that are free floating in the lumen of the tube and psamomma bodies. In some studies PHT was associated with ovarian serous borderline tumour (SBT) although being poorly investigated with molecular methods. We investigate p53 and Ki-67 expression in fallopian tubes from patients with SBT and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). Method: 58 patients were recruited (34 with SBT, 33 with HGSC and 14 with normal fallopian tubes (control group (CG), p53 and Ki-67 expression were detected in their fallopian tubes. Results: PHT was diagnosed in 73 % of SBT patients, 20 % of HGSC patients and was not diagnosed in CG (p < 0.05). PHT showed weak nuclear and/or cytoplasmic p53 staining, Ki-67 expression was low (<5 %) in 90 %. Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) was diagnosed in 25 % of HGSC patients and was not revealed in SBT patients and in CG. STIC showed strong nuclear p53-staining and high Ki-67 expression (>10 %), (p < 0.05). Patients from CG showed weak p53-staining and low Ki-67 expression in 100 % of fallopian tubes. Conclusion: Coincidence of PHT and SBT can reflect simultaneous development of precancerous and neoplastic lesions in the fallopian tube and in the ovary. Thus, PHT shows genomic instability, involves wild type h53 stabilization and takes precedence of neoplastic transformation. In addition our results prove the hypothesis about different pathogeneses of low-grade serous carcinoma (through PHT) and HGSC (through STIC).PS-09-005Adenosarcoma of the cervix: A case report M.

Method: The present work was done at Dept of Pathology, J. N. Medical College, Belgaum, Karnataka, India, from Jan 2010 to June 2013 for evaluation of marker and data analysis. The study included 120 surface epithelial Ovarian tumours confirmed histopathologically. In all the cases, Osteopontin expression was studied with IHC on paraffin sections. Results: This study included 95 (79.2 %) benign tumours and 25 (20.8 %) malignant tumours. All Benign epithelial tumours were negative for Osteopontin expression. All high grade (III) malignant Ovarian epithelial tumours showed increased expression of Osteopontin of +++ and low grade (I & II) tumours expressed +/++ Osteopontin. High grade serous carcinoma was seen to be common malignant tumour. With Fisher Exact test, p value < 0.0001 was significant for expression of Osteopontin. Conclusion: Osteopontin expression was seen in all the malignant epithelial tumours of Ovary. Osteopontin expression was significantly higher in high grade epithelial carcinoma of ovary as compared to low grade tumour. Hence Osteopontin is a good prognostic indicator in grading of Malignant Ovarian epithelial tumours.

Bencsikova * St. Anne's University Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Brno, Czech RepublicObjective: Strumal carcinoid (SC) is a rare variant of ovarian teratoma, characterized by an intimate mixture of thyroid tissue and carcinoid structures in a variable proportion. Primary ovarian carcinoids form 5 % of ovarian teratomas and 0, 5-1, 7 % of all carcinoid tumours. Results: Case Description: We present a case of strumal carcinoid occurring in 45-year-old woman. The pacient with short history of constipation underwent an unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for cystic tumour of the left ovary detected by the ultrasonography. Histopathological analysis of the tumour mass revealed SC of typical morphology. The woman subsequently underwent abdominal hysteradnexectomy and omentectomy without residual tumour structures. No subsequent therapy was indicated. Currently, the patient has no signs of relaps. Conclusion: Primary ovarian carcinoid tumours represent a group of ovarian monodermal teratomas, occuring in middle-aged or older women. Most patients are asymptomatic or may have unspecific symptoms of abdominal distention, a minority has carcinoid syndrom or a constipation. These tumours are classified into five groups according to their histological patterns: insular, trabecular, mucinous, strumal and mixed. Only few cases have malignant course. SC, when confined to the ovary, is almost always benign.PS-09-031 Impaired endometrial receptivity in infertile patients with external genital endometriosis E. Kogan * , E. Kalinina, A.

This tumour affects mainly young women, with an incidence of less than 0,5 % of ovarian tumours. We present a case of unilateral ovarian tumour in a 34-year old patient. Method: The tissue sections were conventionally fixed, embedded, stained with HeEo and immunostained with Calretinin, Inhibin, CK7, CK20, Vimentin, CD99 and Synaptophysin. Results: Gross examination of the pathologic specimen showed an ovarian mass with a diameter of 14 cm, with smooth intact external surface. The cut section revealed solid tumour with cystic areas filled with clear fluid. The histopathologic examination showed cysts lined by cuboidal cells and mucinous and goblet cells of intestinal type. The solid part of the tumour consisted of Sertoli cells forming retiform and tubular structures and clusters od Leydig cells. The Sertoli cells were positive for CK7, Inhibin and Vimentin, focally for Calretinin and CD99, and negative for CK20 and Synaptophysin. The tumour was FIGO stage IA. Conclusion: Since the overall prognosis of SLCTs is good, recognizing this specific entity and it varieties is essential for further proper management of the patients.PS-09-034Adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube.

They are subdivided in to four types: insular, trabecular, strumal and mucinous but mixed types also occur. Primary trabecular carcinoid usually arises in association with teratomatous elements. Pure forms are very rare. Method: We report a case of 2,3 cm sized, solid, firm, oval with a smooth outline, yellow right ovary tumour in a 70 years old woman. The patient had vaginal bleeding and a mature cystic teratoma / epidermoid cyst of controlateral ovary. No history of hormonal disorders.Results: Microscopically the tumour composed of trabeculae and ribbons surrounded by large eosinophilic cells resembling luteinized or Leyding stromal cells. The trabeculae's and ribbon's cells had ovoid or elongated nuclei. No mitotic activity nor necrosis were found. Immunohistichemical analysis showed strong positivity of trabeculae's cells for neuroendocrine markers as well as cytokeratins (Cam5-2) and positivity of eosinophilic stromal cells for vimentin, a-inhibin, calretinin. MIB:<1 %. A diagnosis of primary ovarian trabecular carcinoid with luteinized stromal cells was done. Conclusion: Because of the rarity and heterogenity of POCTs (which occasionally may resemble a sex cord stromal tumour), combination of morphologic criteria, immunohistochemical findings and the clinical history can put a definitive diagnosis.

Method: We observed three patients, aging 23-41 years old, which have got through the excision of postoperational cicatrix, that formed after gynecological operations. Results: In all patients, during macroscopical research we found a soft tissue formation of mildly-elastic consistency from 2,0 up to 4,5 cm which was gray-pink colored on the section, with thin capsule and local hemorrhages under the capsule and also a deposition of a brown pigment sized up to 0,3-0,5 cm. Microscopicly we observed foci with highly developed glandular component with cystic transformation in some parts, focal flattering of a gland covering epithelium. Conclusion: In immunohistochemical research, with the usage of monoclonal antireceptor antibodies to estrogen(ER), progesterone (PR), cytokeratins 7 and 18 (\u0421\u041a7, \u0421\u041a18), in endometrioid foci we found the expression of PR, cytokeratins 7 and 18 and poor expression of ER. Morphological presentation and immunophenotype match the diagnosis of focal endometriosis.

Aim of the researchwas to determine the presence and level of p16INK4a expression in inflammatory, preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. Method: The study was performed on 109 samples of cervical biopsy. Cervical cancer was diagnosed in 36 patients, in 34 patients a preneoplastic change and in 39 a nonspecific inflammatory process. In all samples, immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies to p16INK4a was performed. Results: The expression of p16INK4a was verified in all cases of cervical cancer, in 67.65 % of cases in dysplastic cervical lesions and 38.5 % of inflammatory lesions. Statistically highly significant difference was found in the presence and level of expression among neoplasic, dysplastic and inflammatory lesions of the cervix ( = 76.02, p < 0.001). The expression was more frequent and had a higher level in neoplastic and high grade dysplastic lesions compared to expression in inflammatory lesions and low grade dysplasias. Conclusion: The analysis of the presence of p16INK4a can differentiate nonneoplastic, high grade preneoplastic and neoplastic changes of the cervix. The use of p16INK4a in interpreting of borderline lesions of the cervix can enable a rational therapeutic treatment of patients.",

The KRAS mutations on codons 12 and 13 were observed in 40 % of metastatic colorectal cancer. Method: Our sample includes 361 cases of which 41 are metastatic.The distribution by sex found a male predominance.The extreme age as for males are between 26-86 years old, 80 and 34 years for females. Detection of KRAS is done on fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. KRAS genetic research was performed on 35 cases of metastatic colorectal cancer. Results: Tissue specimens were the subject of a KRAS mutation research at codon 12 and 13 of exon 2. Ten cases had the following mutations: Six at codon 12: C.35G> T p.G12V; C.34G> T p.G12C; C.35G> T, p.G12V; C.35G> C, p.G12A; C.35G> T p.G12V; C.34G> T p.G12C.

Poteca * 'Victor Babes' University of Medicine, Dept. of Molecular Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health problem being the third leading cause of mortality by cancer. Mutational activation of KRAS and BRAF gene and methylation of CpG islands play an important role in colorectal cancer progression. Method: We studied tumour fragments from 30 patients with CRC and determined mutation status of KRAS and BRAF gene and methylation levels of DNA. Results: The analysis revealed increased levels of DNA methylation in the tumour tissue compared with normal colon mucosa for 21 genes studied, except CDH1 gene (p = 1.8 E-6); we obtained similar results in the case of tumour tissue versus peritumoral tissue (p = 0.0006). Regarding the mutational status of the KRAS and BRAF gene, significant differences were observed between the tumour tissue with the mutation and the wild type, identifying high levels of methylation for all genes in tumour tissue with the mutation, except RUNX3 gene.Conclusion: Identification of KRAS and BRAF gene mutations and DNA methylation levels is a sensitive and specific marker for both the establishment of a molecular classification and for diagnosis and prognosis in CRC.

Nonaka, K. Nagata, I. Murakami, M. Kato, Y. Kitamura, K. Hayashi * Tottori University, Faculty of Medicine, Yonago, Japan Objective: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a polyomavirus that is monoclonally integrated into about 80 % of MCCs.Recent studies have demonstrated carcinogenic contribution of activation-induced deaminase (AID), a DNA mutator, in some inflammation-related carcinomas. We analyzed whether AID is associated with virus-related carcinogenesis in MCCs. Method: Immunohistochemical expressions for AID, NF-\u03baB and Pax5 were analyzed using H-score in 20 MCPyV-positive, 10 MCPyVnegative and metastatic MCCs. Quantitative RT-PCR for AID mRNA will be also performed. Results: AID expression (H-score); MCPyV-positive MCCs <MCPyVnegative MCCs (p = 0.049), and pure MCCs > combined tumour components (p = 0.016). NF-\u03baB expression; MCPyV-positive MCCs >MCPyV-negative MCCs (p = 0.028), and pure MCCs < metastatic MCCs (P = 0.004). High H-score of Pax5 expression was observed in both MCC subgroups, but there was no significant difference. Conclusion: AID expression in MCPyV-positive MCCs may be upregulated by not only MCPyV-induced NF-\u03baB but Pax5 expression, whereas unexpected higher AID expression in MCPyV-negative MCCs will be explained with not only Pax5 but other unknown strong inducers. Silencing factor data on AID expression is also important. MCPyV may contribute to AID induction but there must be more potent AID inducers in MCCs.PS-11-011Incidence of melanoma in melanotic tumours L. Beddar * , F. Bouledjnib, N. Bougherra, Z. Hazmoune, M.

Bosic * , S. Cirovic, D. Brasanac * University of Belgrade, Inst. of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, SerbiaObjective: Protein arginine methyltransferases 1 and 6 (PRMT1 and PRMT6) are post-translational modifiers involved in regulation of gene transcription and cell proliferation. Method: Immunohistochemical staining for PRMT1 and PRMT6 proteins was performed on tissue microarray blocks constructed from 168 cases of cutaneous SCC (58 well-, 55 moderately-, and 55 poorly-differentiated SCC). Evaluation of PRMT1 and PRMT6 expression was assessed in three ways: a) semi-quantitative analysis of expression level (number of positive cells in tumour); b) distribution of positive cells in tumour islands; c) intensity of immunostaining. Expression of PRMT1 and PRMT6 was analyzed in relation to tumour level of differentiation, diameter and microscopically determined thickness, as prognostic factors of SCC. Results: Poorly differentiated tumours had low intensity of PRMT1 immunostaining (p = 0.001), low expression level (p = 0.04), and diffuse distribution of positive cells (p < 0.001). In poorly differentiated SCCs intensity of PRMT6 immunostaining and expression level were high (p < 0.001), and positive cells were arranged in diffuse distribution (p < 0.001). No association was found with tumour diameter. Tumour thinner than 6 mm had high expression level of PRMT6 (p = 0.042) and diffuse distribution of positive-cells (p = 0.034).Conclusion: Our immunohistochemical analysis suggests possible downregulation of PRMT1 and overexpression of PRMT6 during progression of SCC. PS-11-016 Digital image analysis of melanocytic proliferation can reduce falsenegative melanoma diagnoses A. Wandler * , P. Switten Nielsen, T. Steiniche * Aarhus University Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Aarhus C, Denmark Objective: To evaluate if digital melanocytic proliferation quantification can reduce false-negative melanoma diagnoses. Method: 10 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded melanocytic skin tumours were included. The lesions were initially diagnosed as benign, but the development of subsequent metastases resulted in revised, malignant diagnoses. The tumours were stained with the MART1/Ki-67 immunohistochemical double stain. Whole slide images were scanned and quantified automatically by digital image analysis. MART1/Ki-67 indices were evaluated in four regions of interest: (I) Global dermal area index (proportion between nuclear area of proliferating melanocytic cells and tumour area), (II) hotspot dermal area index (proportion between nuclear area of proliferating melanocytic cells and tumour area in hotspot), (III) global dermal proportion of melanocytic cells in proliferation, and (IV) dermal hotspot proportion of melanocytic cells in proliferation. Results: Using previously validated cut-off values to distinguish benign nevi from melanomas (I) classified 10/10 tumours as malignant, (II) classified 8/10 tumours as malignant, (III) classified 8/10 tumours as malignant and (IV) classified 9/10 tumours as malignant. Conclusion: The application of digital image analysis of dermal melanocytic proliferation in routine diagnostics may alert the examiner and thus, hopefully, reduce false-negative melanoma diagnoses.

The spectrum of its lesions is related with the immunological status of the individual. Method: We report a case of a 36-year-old pregnant woman from Paraguay who presented with pruritic papules, misdiagnosed of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy. The Dermatology service performed skin biopsies of upper back, flank, and leg. Results: The histopathological study of the upper back and flank biopsies shows small dermal collections of macrophages with perivascular, perineural and periappendageal distribution, with few lymphocytes. In the cytoplasm of many of these macrophages there are eosinophilic masses of organisms intensely positive with Job-fitte technique. The leg biopsy shows in dermis a dense population of spindle-shaped cells that resembles a fibrohistiocytic tumour, with small collections of foamy macrophages. With Job-fitte there are numerous intracytoplasmic bacilli. These spindle-shaped cells are Factor 13a positive and S-100 negative. The patient was diagnosed with borderline-lepromatous leprosy. Conclusion: Hyperactive lepromatous leprosy can occur during pregnancy as a reactional state of immunological instability in patients without previous leprosy diagnose. These histioid lesions are reported in literature as Factor 13a positive/S-100 negative, and histologically may be misdiagnosed as a fibrohistiocytic tumour.PS-11-032Low level laser therapy (810 nm) in oral lichen planus: Immunohistochemical study S.

Dema * University of Medicine Timisoara, Dept. of Pathology, RomaniaObjective: Tumour staging is the most important prognostic predictor for clinical outcome in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC). We aimed to assess the clinicopathologic factors in patients with early stage (pT1-T2) versus advanced CRC. Method: We performed a multivariate analysis in patients with CRC who underwent radical resections in Timisoara County Hospital from 2010 to 2013. Associations between tumour stage (pT1-T2 vs. pT3-T4) and tumour grade, nodal status (LNM), as well as the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were analyzed using the Fischer's exact test. Results: We identified 539 cases of CRC. The incidence of CRC increased with age, with a slight predominance in males (323 cases, 60 %). 15 % of the cases were stage pT1-T2, 85 % pT3-T4. Five percent of all the cases were well-differentiated (G1), 95 % moderately (G2) and poorly (G3) differentiated CRC. In multivariate analysis low differentiation (p = 0,0178, OR = 2,793), LVI (p < 0,0001, OR = 10,92) and LNM (p < 0,0001, OR = 5,631) were significantly related to depth of invasion. Conclusion: LVI, LNM and tumour grade are independent risk factors in pT1-T2 CRC. Due to the subjective nature of some of the elements assessed and the controversy in colorectal pathology reporting we need standardized examination protocol and reporting.PS-12-016Metastatic Mixed Mdenoneuroendocrine Carcinomas (MANECs) of the colorectum: Two cases P.

They are very uncommon in the colon. Method: A 49 years old woman was admitted to gastroenterology clinic for routin screening. A colonoscopy revealed one polyp in the colon measuring 5 mm in largest diameter. The polyp was removed with hot biopsy forceps. Results: Histopathologic evaluation of polyp displayed displaced colonic crypts with underlying proliferation of ganglion and spindled schwan cells within the lamina propria. The polyp reacted positively to neuron spesific enolase stain and S-100 stain.

Doganavsargil * Ege University, Dept. of Pathology, Izmir, TurkeyObjective: Desmoplastic reaction (DR) is characterized by stromal fibrosis and myofibroblastic proliferation. The complex signaling pathway between tumour and stromal cells is not illuminated yet. We investigated the relationship between prominent DR and other clinicopathological features in colorectal cancer. Method: One hundred consequent cases diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 years, with available survival data were enrolled in the study and were reevaluated for presence of dense fibroblastic and mixed \"fibroblastic-inflammatory\" DR. Results: The median age was 63 \u00b1 14.7 years-old (range: 22-91), the female/male ratio was 45/55. Forty-eight of the cases were located in right colon, 84 % had T3, 63 % had (N1-N2), 36 % had perineural invasion (PNI) positive tumours. DR was pure fibroblastic in 27 % and mixed in 25 % of the cases. Overall 33 (91.7 %) of the cases with DR had PNI (p = 0,000,\u03c72) and 38 (73 %) had lymph node metastases (p = 0.032, \u03c72). Among the PNI positive group, 21 (77.8 %) had fibroblastic DR (p = 0, 000,\u03c72) and 59 % (n = 16) of them has died during the follow up (p = 0.022, \u03c72). No correlation was found between age, gender, location and tumour stage. Conclusion: The significant correlation between fibroblastic DR and presence of PNI deserves further research for both understanding the crosstalk between tumour cells and tumoural microenviroment and for developing future targeted therapies.PS-12-033 SMAD4 expression as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer J.

Janevski, B. Dukova, L. Spasevska, V. Janevska * University Clinic of Oncology and Histopathology, Skopje, Republic of MacedoniaObjective: Some authors suggest common origin of all gastrointestinal stromal tumours from stem cells, which may show diverse differentiation. There are reports in which cells with a morphology of interstitial Cajallike cells are found in deep leiomyomas. The aim of this study was to demonstrate CD117 positive cells in superficial gastrointestinal (GI) leiomyomas and to find other cells that would suggest diverse differentiation in histologically typical leiomyoma. Method: We have analyzed 9 cases of superficial leiomyomas, received in our institutions as endoscopically or surgically obtained material. The tumour sections were immunohistochemicaly stained with CD117, CD34, NSE, S 100, \u03b1-S MA and desmin. Results: There were one esophageal and 8 colonic superficial leiomyomas, 2 of which rectal. Histological analysis showed presence of stellate cells morphologically similar to the interstitial cells of Cajal. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that in addition to diffuse positivity for -SMA and desmin, all leiomyomas showed presence of CD117, CD34 and NSE positive cells between smooth muscle cells, while six of them showed presence of S-100 positive cells. The cells were found in different quantity, usually were scarce and diffusely scattered through the tumours without predilection site. Conclusion: The presence of CD177, CD 34, S-100 and NSE positive cells in superficial leiomyomas may suggest a common origin of GI stromal tumours. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the gastrointestinal tract presenting as a mass-like lesion is an extremely rare condition. Less than 50 cases were reported in literature to date. Association of CMVand acidfast bacilli (AFB) is also very rare and usually occurs in immunosuppressed patients. Method: We report the case of a 63-year-old man with a 15-year history of abdominal complaints and 5-year history of ileo-caecal Crohn's disease. In 2012 he presented with haemoptysis. Further investigation revealed basal bronchiectasis and tuberculous sequelae, negative bronchoalveolar lavage and Quantiferon Gold test. Recently he presented with a flare of ileo-caecal inflammation. Colonoscopy revealed an infiltrative and ulcerated ileo-caecal mass, which was biopsied. Results: Microscopically, the biopsy showed ulcerative/erosive inflammation, with areas of necrotizing granulomas and viral cytopathic changes within stromal, endothelial and epithelial cells, characteristic of cytomegalovirus infection: enlarged cell size, enlarged and centrally located nuclei and nuclear inclusions. The infection was confirmed by positive nuclear CMV immunohistochemical stain. Ziehl Neelsen stain was also positive. The patient died 4 days after the histological report was issued. Conclusion: Marked immunosuppression was associated with AFB and CMV infection in this patient. It's not clear whether this was an association of Crohn's with tuberculosis or tuberculosis interpreted as Crohn's disease.PS-12-045Comparative assessment of CD34 and Endoglin (CD105) positive tumour blood vessels from rectal cancer: Correlation with biological and histopathological parametersA.-A.

Method: We describe a recent case from a 84-year-old female with a tumour submitted to abdominoperineal resection of the rectum and total mesorectal excision; no clinical evidence of distant metastases. Results: The tumour disclosed a large cell component (60 %) admixed with a squamous component (40 %), invaded the mesorectum, and focally the surgical mesorectal margin; no evidence of any anal neoplasm; 38/ 40 lymph nodes with metastases, several with both components.The large cell component expressed synaptophysin, CAM5.2, and high Ki-67 index (80 %), whereas squamous component expressed AE1/AE3 and p63. Final diagnosis: MNSC of the rectum, pT3 N2b M0 R1. Conclusion: The 2010 OMS classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms includes mixed neuroendocrine carcinomas that occur in different sites of the gastrointestinal tract. The non-neuroendocrine component may be an adenocarcinoma (MANEC) or, less frequently, a squamous carcinoma. MANEC occur more often in the stomach and colorectum; MNSC more often in the esophagus and anorectum. MNSC are aggressive neoplasms rarely reported in the rectum (a couple of published cases) that must be accurately diagnosed to allow the best management decision for patients harboring these tumours.

Data was analyzed using Graph Pad Prism 5. Results: Our study has proved a coherence between percentage of PC with plasmablastic differentiation and decreased GFR (r = \u22120.267, p = 0.0255). Statistically significant positive correlation by Spearman test was found between p53 protein expression in PC and creatinin (r = + 0.2628; p = 0.028) level and with decreased GFR, BM cellularity (r = \u22120.2625, p = 0.0282) and p53 expression (r = \u22120.2543; p = 0.0336). A significant positive correlation was between CD56 expression and increased GFR (r = +0.4674, p < 0.0001) and decreased creatinin level (r = \u22120.4387, p = 0.0001). Conclusion: Increased BM cellularity, high amount of PC, increased percentage of PC with plasmablastic differentiation, p53 immunoexpression and lack of CD56 antigen in PC statistically significantly correlated with increased creatinin level and decreased GFR These correlations are criteria for chronic renal failure progression and poorer prognosis of MM.PS-13-009 The main key in diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: Cell morphology Y.

Method: Disease began with sponatneous haemathoma of skin. Laboratory tests showed lymphocytosis, with maximum level of lymohocytes of 45-50. \"Watch and wait\" terapy were performed. After 2 years of disease troat pain started and enlargment of left tonsil diagnosed. Bilateral tonsillectomy preformed. Patients have long term history of hypertension and hearth problem. Family anamnesis with malignant disease were negative. Results: Patohistological exam found infiltration of tonsills with small lymphocyt with round nuclei, condens chromatin and scanty cytoplasm. Mild irregularity of nuceli observed. About 15 % of cell were larger, with opet chromatin and distinct nucleoli, coresponding to prolymphocyts. Rare immunoblasts with vesicular nuclei and obvious nucleoli were present. Remnant tonsils folliculs were visible, mostly at periphery of tissue. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD45, CD23, CD20 and CD5. Ki67 stains about 10-15 % of cells nuclei. CD68 stained histiocyt at follicular center of normal tonsilar tissue. Level of erythrocyt, platelets and other biochemical analisis were in referent values. No lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly where found. There was no B symptoms.

In the literature is described as an aggressive disease without a standard treatment. Method: Female 64 years with appearance of four erythematous lesions on the dorsum of the hands 6 months before the diagnosis. After no improvement of the lesions and the appearance of another lesion with similar clinical characteristics a punch was performed.",

Campo * Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Dept. of Pathology, SpainObjective: To analyze the morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular features of the spectrum of lesions comprising dendritic cell sarcoma (DCS), the variant type of inflammatory pseudotumor DCS (DCS-IPT) and IPT. Method: We reviewed 13 cases of DCS and abdominal located IPT collected during the period 2000-2015. Expression of dendritic cell markers (CD35, CD21, CD23 and CNA42), EBV RNA (EBER) expression, V600E BRAF and MAP2K gene mutations were investigated. Results: The series included 6 DCS, 1 splenic DCS-IPT and 6 IPT. A liver IPT was reclassified as DCS-IPT based on morphology and EBER positivity. All DCS and DCS-IPT were positive for at least one dendritic cell marker. One DCS and one DCS-IPT were positive for all dendritic cell markers. EBER was only positive in the two DCS-IPT. The only case with V600E BRAF mutation corresponded to a DCS-IPT. Conclusion: The presence of EBV in a spindle cell proliferation in hepatosplenic locations should lead to suspicion of DCS-IPT, especially when positivity for dendritic cells markers may be limited, focal and weak. The presence of the V600E mutation of the BRAF gene may help in the differential diagnosis with ITP and locates this neoplasm closer to DCS.PS-13-035 Lymphocyte-rich Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma (LRCHL) mimicking Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified (PTCL, NOS) M. Nifora * , P. Aroukatos, I. Kotsikogianni, E. Panopoulou, P. Zikos * General Hospital Patras, Dept. of Pathology, Greece Objective: LRCHL is characterized by RS cells and variants in a background dominated by small lymphocytes in a nodular or rarely diffuse growth pattern. Method: A 60 year-old, asymptomatic, male patient, presented with cervical, mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy. Cervical lymph node biopsy was performed. Results: Lymph node architecture was effaced by a diffuse and vaguely nodular infiltrate. Nodular areas corresponded to B-cell rich follicular structures where RS cells and variants were located and surrounded by (CD3+/CD57-) T-cell rosettes, with occasional regressed germinal centers. Diffuse areas consisted of large numbers of small/medium sized Tcells with irregular nuclear contours and moderate amount of pale cytoplasm expressing (CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, Bcl-6, CD8>CD4, Ki67 high) with RS cells and variants admixed among them. Clonality assessment for TCR rearrangements was negative. Conclusion: Follicular variant of PTCL, NOS can have overlapping morphologic features with LRCHL. Clonality studies in association with immunohistochemistry are indispensable in order to differentiate atypical appearing background T-cells in a LRCHL case, from PTCL, NOS with RS-like cells or rarely, a composite lymphoproliferative process.

Calli * Izmir Katip Celebi University, Ataturk Training and Research Hosp., Dept. of Pathology, TurkeyObjective: Multiple Myeloma (MM) has highly heterogeneous outcome, so prognostic factors become very important. Although several immunophenotypic molecules have been studied so far, prognostic importance of CD56 and Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) have not been well described. Our aim is to define if any correlation between those markers and prognostic parameters in MM. Method: We retrospectively analyzed MM patients diagnosed between January 2009 and October 2014 in our institution. Fourty patients were divided into 4 groups and each group had 10 patients. Group 1: EMA(+), CD56(+); Group 2: EMA(-), C56(-); Group 3: EMA (+), CD56(-); Group 4: EMA (-), CD56(+).

The aim was to determine the frequency of MDS/EVI1 gene fusion in cases of histologically diagnosed primary MDS in children on bone marrow biopsy samples. Method: In a 5 year period (2010-2014) 12 bone marrow biopsy samples of children were examined at the Institute of pathology in Skopje using standard hematoxylin/eosin and Giemsa stained sections.Six of them were diagnosed as having myelodysplastic syndrome. We isolated DNA from all 6 bone marrow biopsy in order to test for MDS/EVI1 presence. MDS/EVI1 fusion was detected with touch-down-direct PCR. Results: We found the presence of MDS/EVI1 gene fusion in 5 cases (overall 83 %). Conclusion: As was previously mentioned, the myelodysplastic syndrome is a complex disorder. It may arise as a primary disorder, in a setting of an underlying disease, or is therapy related (secondary myelodysplastic syndrome). Some cases show MDS/EVI1 gene fusion. In our 5 year retrospective study of 6 histologically diagnosed myelodysplastic syndromes in children at the Institute of pathology in Skopje, we found the MDS/EVI1 gene fusion in 5 of them.PS-13-059 Mantle cell lymphoma involving the colon (Multiple Lymphomatous Polyposis): A case report and review of treatment modalities K.

Method: A 21 year-old female presented with persistent galactorrhea. On serum examination she had increased levels of prolactin. On clinical examination a left side paresis of the oculomotor nerve was revealed. Radiologically a mass at the sellar region was observed that expanded to the sphenoid sinus and bone. A differential diagnosis of pituitary lesion was elaborated and a decision for surgical excision had been taken. It is remarkable that there was galactorrhea during the operation, which stopped immediately after the excision of the mass along with the dramatic drop of prolactin levels. Results: We received for histological examination multiple specimens of elastic composition. Microscopy revealed that the mass was a giant cell tumour of the bone. The proliferation marker Ki67/MIB1 was positive for 30 % of the spindle cells. Despite the multiple sections, no pituitary gland tissue was found. The post-operative follow-up showed improvement of the oculomotor paresis. Conclusion: The clinicopathological correlation indicated that the elevation of prolactin levels and consequently the galactorrhea were due to pressure phenomena of the mass against the pituitary gland.PS-14-020 Rosette forming glioneuronal tumour of fourth ventricle: A case report B. \u00d6g\u00fct * , L.

Other bone matrix proteins have proved useful markers of osteogenic differentiation in bone tumours. Method: We assessed immunohistochemically sclerostin expression in primary benign and malignant bone tumours. Sclerostin mRNA expression was also determined in specimens of osteosarcoma and osteosarcoma cell lines by real time PCR. Results: In lamellar and woven bone, sclerostin was expressed in the matrix around osteocyte lacunae and canaliculi. Osteoblasts and other cell types in bone were negative. Matrix staining of osteoid and bone was seen in bone-forming tumours including osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma and osteosarcoma. Sclerostin staining was also seen in fibrous dysplasia, chondroblastoma and in reactive bone formed in fracture callus, myositis ossificans and in the wall of solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts. Sclerostin was not expressed in the tumour component of other primary bone tumours including chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, giant cell tumour of bone, metastatic carcinoma. Sclerostin mRNA was expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines and tumour samples.Conclusion: Our findings indicate that sclerostin is an osteocyte marker expressed in mature and reactive bone and that it can be identified in osteosarcoma and other bone-forming tumours/tumour-like lesions.

Knolle * St\u00e4dtisches Klinikum Dessau, Abt. Pathologie, GermanyObjective: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a rare variant of fibrosarcoma. These tumours have usually a bad prognosis, and therefore should be differentiated from low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS). Method: We analyzed an own case of SEF and reviewed the literature. Results: A SEF of the forefoot of 71-year-old-woman was resected with positive resection margins. Despite refusing further treatment, the patient has shown no signs of tumour recurrence 20 months after surgery. The tumour showed the typical histology. Strong expression of Vimentin was detectable. Antibodies against Cytokeratins, EMA, INI-1 and S-100 were variable positive. There was no expression of MUC-4, CD34, SMA, Desmin, and HMB45. In genetic examinations the tumour showed no rearrangement of SYT-, FUS-or EWSR1-gene. Conclusion: Up to March 2015 some more than 100 cases of SEF were published, but only a fraction of these were analyzed genetically. A great part of the published tumours shows pattern of LGFMS. But there is a small group of tumours like our tumour with the typical histologic patterns but without the genomic aberrations, gene fusions and immunohistochemical findings characteristic for LGFMS. We think only these tumours should be classified under SEF and should be further investigated.PS-15-018 Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumour in the Halux: Case report and literature review R.

The medical files and histological slides were reviewed. The Rubbia-Brandt system was used. For the statistical analysis a simple probit model was employed. Results: The mean age was 63.5 years, being 69 females and 107 males. Tumours ranged between 0.2 and 18.5 cm. NC was performed in 137 patients (77.8 %). The most frequent drug regimens included oxaliplatin (52-38 %), irinotecan (46-34 %) or both (20-15 %). Forty had also cetuximab (29 %) whereas 22 bevacizumab (16 %). Ninety-three patients (68.4 %) had no response, 29 (21.2 %) a partial response and 14 (10.4 %) a major response (MR). Forty-three had steatosis (31 %), 11 stetohepatitis (8 %) and 39 (28 %) sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). SOS was only observed in the oxaliplatin group (positive impact and statistically significant) while steatohepatitis and steatosis were equally present in the three NC regimens.

Kov\u00e1cs Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden Objective: To identify and characterize incidence of Toker cells (TC) in nipple epidermis in 82 patients: invasive breast cancer (IBC) (n = 63), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n = 4), prophylactic mastectomy (PM) (n = 13), two patients with metastasis of malignant melanoma in the breast. Paget's disease was not included. Method: FFPE samples from the nipples of 82 patients were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using cytokeratin 7 and 19 antibodies. Results: TC in the nipple epidermis were identified in 36/82 cases (44 %): IBC (87 %), DCIS (0 %), PM (46 %), malignant melanoma (0 %). TC were observed in the lower 1/3 of the epidermis in about 90 % of the malignant cases and in PM. In IBCs containing TC in the nipple epidermis, the average distance to the tumour from the nipple was 27.3 mm in comparison with 38 mm in cases without TC. The average number of TC in IBC per IHC slide was 44 and only 18 in the PM group. Conclusion: TC may represent CK7+ intraepithelial extension of lactiferous duct cells or abortive mammary ductile cells. The number of TC is more prominent in cases of underlying carcinoma, and this number increases if the tumour is located in close proximity to the nipple.

In 2013 the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) updated their 2007 HER2 interpretation guidelines. We have explored how these changes impact on HER2 evaluation results. Method: All our 145 breast cancer cases with a 2+ or 3+ HER2 immunohistochemical score (years 2013 and 2014) were evaluated separately following both the 2007 and 2013 ASCO-CAP HER2 FISH interpretation criteria. Results: Of the 145 cases, 2007 and 2013 guidelines provided discordant HER2 amplification results in 14 instances. Specifically, 10 nonamplified cases according to 2007 criteria were placed in the equivocal category by 2013 criteria, 3 equivocal cases were upgraded to positive for amplification, and 1 negative case was moved to the amplified category. Conclusion: In our hands, the 2013 updating of HER2 interpretation guidelines results in an increased number of cases needing FISH evaluation. New criteria make evaluation more laborious, since more cases require signal counting while the percentage of cluster signal cases remains unchanged. Implementation of the new guidelines increases the number of equivocal cases and unveils few instances of HER2 amplification.

Identification of ERBB2 gene status was done by chromogenic or fluorescence in situ hybridization (CISH/FISH). Results: The mean age of patients studied was 58.69 \u00b1 10.21. The majority of patients (82 %) were diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinomas. ERBB2 gene status reveled no gene amplification in 68 % cases, low level amplification in 22 % cases and high level amplification in 7 % cases. Tumour heterogeneity was observed only in 3 % of cases. The estrogen receptor status presented positive expression in 70 % of cases and progesterone receptor positive expression was detected in 75 % of cases. According to Ki67 proliferation marker expression in 72 % Ki67 was positive in >10 % of tumoural nuclei and in 28 % Ki67 was positive in <10 % of tumoural nuclei. Only 6 % of cases were categorized as triple negative breast cancer. Conclusion: Daily management of patient with breast carcinomas remains critically dependent on careful pathological evaluation supplemented by ER, PR and ERBB2 test.Petrov Research Institute, Dept. of Pathology, St. Petersburg, Russia",

Method: 202 cases including EC, simple EH with and without atypia, complex EH with and without atypia and normal endometrium were assesed immunohistochemically with tissue microarray method. It has been shown that PTEN, ARID1A and MLH1 has a role in transition from simple EH to atypical complex EH, also MLH1 has a role in the transition from aytpical complex EH to EC. There were significant concordance in loss of expression PTEN with ARID1A and ARID1A with MLH1 in EC. This condition showed that these three tumorigenesis signaling pathways and protein could have a connection or interaction. Macroscopically the main tumour was in ovaries. There was tumour infiltration also in cervix and abdomen. Microscopically the tumour was composed of low grade seromucinous type of cuboidal cells with stroma having inflammatory cells. An endometriotic foci was accompanying the tumour area in cervix. The tumour was diffusely positive for CK7; focally positive for ER, PR, WT1, P53. CD20 was negative. Conclusion: We present this newly renamed entity to express the new nomenclature and remind its relation with endometriosis. The stroma was hyalinized and there was an infiltration of perineural spaces. We concluded to an ACC of Bartholin's gland with positive margins. So the patient underwent a vulvectomy with bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. After 6 months of the initial diagnosis, the patient continues to survive and she does not have metastasis. Conclusion: ACC of Bartholin's gland is a slow growing tumour locally very aggressive with a high capacity for local recurrence and lung metastasis. Surgery is the most common and useful treatment.

To overcome these difficulties, we present an approach to describe objects in histological slides (e.g. cells, bone trabeculae) by a scalar field. Method: The transformation of objects within images to a scalar field was performed by convolution of the object's centroids with differently formed radial basis functions (e.g. for direct or indirect spatial interaction). Results: After image registration i) the scalar field, which is quite resistant to matching errors and minor morphological alterations, could be propagated through registered images; ii) the overlap of fields, which represents the spatial distance of different objects (e.g. two cells), could be calculated by the histogram intersection; iii) several well-established co-localization measurements (e.g. the Manders overlap coefficient) could be calculated; iv) the summation field of object groups could be used to identify clusters. Conclusion: The description of objects (e.g. cells, cell clusters, bone trabeculae) as field facilitates the combination of information from serial sections, and allows automatic identification of object clusters and the analysis of different types of spatial interaction (e.g. direct vs. paracrine).",

Hijmering, F. van Objective: The Dutch National Tissuebank Portal (DNTP) project aims to achieve increased, easier and improved secondary use of residual human tissue samples (FFPE blocks) from all pathology laboratories in the Netherlands. Method: Currently, there are more than 60 million archived FFPE samples with standardized associated data which can be used for research purposes. With the DNTP researchers can request samples online through the portal from where the request will automatically be sent to the pathology laboratory where the samples are stored. After approval from a research-and privacy committee and the participating laboratory a DNTP employee will collect the samples and send them to the researcher. Pathology laboratories can request a sample to return, if this sample is needed for delayed patient care. Results: The result will be that in the Netherlands we have established a professional research infrastructure that will provide virtual and physical access to all residual FFPE pathology samples and their associated data for research purposes. Nowhere in the world does such a web based portal exist that supports pathology laboratories and researchers in their quest of searching, requesting, registering, retrieving and returning archived FFPE samples for research from all the national pathology archives. Conclusion: This project was financially supported by Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure The Netherlands (BBMRI-NL), a Research Infrastructure financed by the Dutch Government (NWO 184.021.007). BBMRI-NL co-ordinates the collaboration between Dutch biobanks. It is not a biobank itself, but facilitates collaboration by harmonization and enrichment of existing biobanks.",

B\u00fcttner * Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Inst. f\u00fcr Nephropathologie, Germany Objective: Complement deposition is frequently observed in kidney biopsies of patients with hypertensive renal disease, but an association of hypertension and complement deposition or involvement of complement in the pathogenesis of hypertensive nephropathy has not been investigated. Method: 230 archival human renal biopsies with hypertensive nephropathy and 80 control biopsies with non-hypertensive renal diseases were investigated using immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative scores. The results were correlated with renal function. To address whether complement was only passively deposited or actively expressed by renal cells, complement deposition, C1 and C3 mRNA expression was analyzed in the 5/6 nephrectomy model of hypertension (n = 12) and controls (n = 10). Results: Glomerular C1q and C3c complement deposition was significantly higher in hypertensive patients and rats than in non-hypertensive controls. Mean arterial blood pressure in 5/6-nephrectomy rats correlated well with the amount of C1q (r = 0.790; p < 0.0001), C3c deposition (r = 0,697; p < 0.0003) and also with left ventricular weight (C1q: r = 0.819; C3c: r = 0.621; p < 0.002). C3 was not only deposited but also produced by renal cells of hypertensive rats as assessed by quantitative mRNA analysis. Of note, in hypertensive patients renal function as measured by creatinine clearance correlated significantly negative with the intensity of C1q staining (r = \u22120.322; p = 0.001), but not with that of C3c. Conclusion: Hypertensive nephropathy, but not other non-hypertensive renal diseases, was significantly associated with in-situ expression and deposition of complement. This finding may open new therapeutic options. Since complement activation is known to have multiple disease promoting effects further investigations are needed to identify whether it is involved in the pathogenesis or progression of hypertensive nephropathy. Objective: Glomerular IgA-dominant deposition in the setting of proliferative glomerulonephritis usually indicates IgA nephropathy, and is rare in postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN). IgA-dominant PIGN is an immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis that occurs following staphylococcal infection. The typical histological pattern of IgAdominant PIGN includes endocapillary or mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. By electron microscopy subepithelial \"hump-shaped\" deposits are shown. Method: We report a case of IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis in 49 years old male presenting acute kidney injury, nephrotic range proteinuria and hematuria. The patient had not documented infections at the time of the presentation. He suffered from ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid insufficiency, septal aneurysm and hypertension. Renal biopsy was done and light microscopy revealed thickening of glomerular capillary wall and slight segmental and focal endocapillary and mesangial hypercellularity. Immunofluorescence showed strong coarse granular immunostaining of IgA, IgG and C3, lower immunostaining of kappa light chain and weak immunostaining of lambda light chain along glomerular capillary wall. On electron microscopy, subepithelial electron-dense deposits, small intramembranous deposits and some large hump-shaped deposits were present. Results: The presented case does not entirely meet criteria of PIGN, because of lack of clinically proven infection. Moreover in the light microscopy the thickening of capillary wall was dominant, whereas mesangial or endocapillary hypercellularity was focal and segmental. Conclusion: An unusual case of IgA-dominant PIGN should be taken into consideration, as the infection may be subclinical. In differential diagnosis the IgA nephropathy should be considered. Discriminating between postinfectious IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis and idiopathic Wednesday, 9 September 2015, 09.30 -10.30, Restaurant PS-19 Poster Session Nephropathology Objective: Comparative analysis of the nosological structure glomerulopaties for the period 2000-2014, subdivided into subperiods 2000-04, 2005-09 and 2010-2014. Method: The study has been performed by the analysis of pathomorphological conclusions on renal biopsies. In accordance with Naumovic R at all . 2009, the groups of primary glomerulopaties (PGP), secondary glomerulopaties (SGP), glomerulonephritis with hereditary and metabolic pathology (GNHM), vascular nephropathy (VN), tubulointerstitial nephropathy (TN), nephropathy under different pathologies were distingiushed. PGP were subdivided on membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy (MN), minimal change disease (MCD), crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN), acute diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (ADPGN), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MGN: Non IgA-and IgA-nephropathy). The systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), amyloidosis, and vasculitis wereselected in the secondary nephropathy. Results: During the period 2000-2014, it was revealed decreasing (from 79 to 72 %) of PGP values and increasing of SGP from 10 to 14 %. The ratio of deseases into PGP has changed due to increasing of IgA -nephropathy, FSGS, and MN. The number of patients with CGN and MCD remained unchanged over the period. Real decreasing in MPGN, DPGN was revealed. Secondary glomerulopaties, despite of increasing in the absolute number of all types, showed the changes in the ratio of nosological groups. So for 10 years the percentage of the deseases into the group was changed due to slight increasing the number of vasculitis and reducing the patients with amyloidosis and SLE. Conclusion: Our results suggest reliable dynamics of nosological types into the groups as PGP, and SGP within 15 years which generally corresponds to the dates of other authors in similar studies.Objective: To analyze histological characteristics of Pulmonary LC Histiocytosis. Method: The investigated material included open lung biopsy samples taken from 14 patients at the mean age of 23.2 years. The intensity of the histological lesions was semiquantitatively measured, differentiating three intensity grades: mild, moderate, intense. Results: In most cases the interalveolar septa were focally and intensively thickened. The inflammatory infiltrates in the septa were intense in 8 moderate in 4, and mild in 2 specimens. Lymphocytes prevailed, followed by macrophages, eosinophil granulocytes, and plasma cells. The lumen of the alveoli was occupied by a few macrophages and lymphocytes, sparse plasma cells and few eosinophil granulocytes. The alveolar cells were focally cuboid in six cases. Poor peribronchial infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells were found in eight cases. Histiocyte aggregates with a stellate border were detected in all specimens, most frequently localized peribronchiolarly (14/14) , perivascularly (6/14) , in the interlobular septa (4/14). The aggregates were predominantly composed of Langerhans' cells (abundant in 14/14 cases), followed by eosinophil granulocytes (sparse in 8/14), lymphocytes (moderate in 8/14 cases), and plasma cells (sparse in 6/14) . The histiocytes were CD1a and S 100 positive. Conclusion: Histiocyte aggregates were registered in all biopsy samples; the histiocytes were CD1a and S100 positive.",

The %predicted FVC change/year was used to define slow (<10 %) or rapid (>10 %) decline. Twenty-seven patients underwent lung transplantation and different histological alterations (inflammation, fibrosis, vasculitis, diffuse alveolar damage) were quantified by morphometric analysis. Results: 63 % patients were slow and 37 % rapid. 23 % (11 slow, 3 rapid) developed acute exacerbation (AE) during follow up. Pathology in 27 explanted lungs showed vasculitis, diffuse alveolar damage and innate and adaptive inflammation in rapid and AE (3 times higher than in slow). Inflammation was related to length of symptoms before diagnosis (r = \u22120.65 p < 0.01) and rate of FVC decline (r = 0.8 p < 0.0032). Conclusion: Slow and rapid decliners are clear phenotypes of IPF with different lung pathology and outcomes. Phenotype identification could be very important in order to recognize outcomes and individualize treatments.",

            "text": "Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) applied to pulmonary pathology K. Metze * , A. P. Racanelli, C. L. Cesar * University of Campinas, Dept. of Pathology, Brazil Objective: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measures the exponential decay rate of fluorescence and creates a virtual image of histologic or cytologic preparations without any staining by attributing virtual colors to different lifetimes of the cellular components. Fluorophores detectable by FLIM remain in sections of paraffin embedded tissues. Therefore, FLIM provides valuable complementary information in material from the archives. The aim of this study was to investigate its utility for pulmonary pathology. Method: Unstained and dewaxed sections of 60 cases of lung specimens were examined with a confocal microscope using a pulsed laser at 405 nm, and a time-correlated single-photon counting equipment for FLIM. Results: The lifetimes of a certain molecule or tissue varied between cases, but the lifetimes between different components (hemoglobin, elastin, smooth muscle and collagen) were highly correlated among all cases, thus permiting the creation of highly contrasted images without any staining. The storage time of the blocks and autolysis increased only slightly the lifetimes of hemoglobin, but not of other components. We obtained detailed histologic images in cases of alveolar proteinosis, corpora amylacea, pneumocystis pneumonia and hyaline membranes. Conclusion: FLIM applied to routinely processed lung specimens from the files has shown to provide reproducible images and valuable additional information in unstained sections. Objective: Generally thymomas type AB are regarded as mixture of type A and type B thymomas, but have not been studied in detail. Many architectural patterns and differences have been described in these types of tumours.Method: A 65-year old female patient admitted to our hospital with symptoms of chest pain and dysphagia. On radiographic evaluation an expansive mediastinal mass measuring >3,4 cm was found and excision of the mass was considered. A whitish, compact mass measuring 3 \u00d7 2, 5 \u00d7 1,5 cm was received for rapid biopsy and the result was consistent for thymoma. We also received multiple other tissue specimens measuring 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0,5 cm, which involved a small lymph node and fatty tissue. An immunohistochemical study was performed with bcl2, p53, ki67, CEA, EMA, AE1/AE3 and TTF1. Results: The lesion, in central location, was composed of spindle-like cells (A element) , while at the periphery a mixed epithelial and lymphocytic population (B2 element) was noted. The neoplasm was well delineated with a fibrous capsule. Focal microinvasions of the former were spotted, with definite invasion of capsule and with no extracapsular extension of the surrounding fatty tissue. Conclusion: The above mentioned morphological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with a thymoma type AB2. Objective: The monosystemic unifocal osseous form of the Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is known as eosinophilic granuloma (EG). The term eosinophilic granuloma was first introduced by Lichenstein and Jaffe in 1940. Eosinophilic granuloma is one of the rarest causes of all osseous neoplasms and accouts for less than 1 %. It most often affects the skull and jaws which is characterized by either single or multiple lytic-bone lesions. It primarly occurs in older children and young adults, with a male prepandarence with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Method: Here we present two cases with an isolated eosinophilic granuloma of the rib with long term follow-up which were treated with surgery alone. Results: Postoperative follow-up showed complete cure of the disease in both patients. Discussion focuses primarly on differantial diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate follow-up for these patients. Conclusion: The rib is rare site and most common in adults. The prognosis is exellent when disease is confined to the skeleton, expecially if it is a solitary lesion, with the majority of such lesions spontaneously resolving. However, where symptoms persist, other treatment options may be considered such as excision and currettage, steroid therapy, chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation. Objective: We report a case of intestinal T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and points out the importance of the immunohistochemestry in the differential diagnosis of lymphoma of the gastro-intestinal tract. Method: 19 year old man without medical history was urgently admitted in an array of acute intestinal obstruction. Imaging showed an ileo-ileal telescoping of ileal loop and its mesentery with asymmetric regular wall thickening. Resection of the small intestine carrying the tumour area was performed. Gross showed three whitish tumours. Histopathologically, the muscularis propria had abundant atypical lymphoid infiltrate in diffuse pattern. Atypical lymphoid cells expressed CD3, CD99 and TDT. CD56 was negatif. Results: In this case, the histological and immunohistological findings concluded to multiple metastasis of a T-LBL in the small intestine. The chest tomography showed later an expensive primary mass in the anterior mediastin. Conclusion: T-LBL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with an overall incidence of 0.1 per 100, and predominantly occur in male adolescents or young adults. A mediastinal mass was present in 80 % of the patients. An acute intestinal obstruction can be the first and unique sign of a T-LBL. Objective: Our purpose was the evaluation of mediastinal tumours and of diagnostic procedures in an oncological Institute. Method: We report preliminary data for the year 2012, based on a pathology database search. Surgical cases derived from mediastinotomy or VATS; cytological samples derived from transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and/or from endoscopic ultrasound-assisted fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA); seven second opinion cases of Thymic Epithelial Tumours were included. Results: All our patients were adults. In the period considered, 44 mediastinal neoplasias were found among 11375 histological cases, 38 malignant (most of them primary), 9 secondary and 6 benign. Among cytological cases (27) 12 were malignant (10 lung carcinoma metastases and 2 lymphoma cases). In 13 cases the material was not sufficient or necrotic; one case was not diagnostic and one was negative. In 5 cytologically malignant samples, the cells were sufficient for predictive molecular biological assays. Primary tumours of all embryological derivations were encountered, thymic epithelial tumours, both in topic and ectopic location, being the most numerous, followed by B-cell lymphomas. Objective: The purpose of the study was to characterize an unusual lymphoid proliferation occurring in the thymus of a 59-years old woman without clinical and laboratory findings of Myasthenia gravis or other autoimmune diseases. Method: The thymus, removed by mediastinotomy, contained a 2 \u00d7 1.5 cm nodule that was investigated by morphology and immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue. The Biomed protocol-2 was applied for the clonality analysis of B-cell receptor. Results: Histologically, the lesion consisted of medulla with marked thymic follicular hyperplasia (FH) and prominent Hassall's bodies; the cortex was atrophic. Uninvolved thymic remnants were present in the adipous tissue at the periphery. The hyperplastic follicles were surrounded by lymphoid cells with clear cytoplasm, reminiscent of an enlarged marginal zone and suggestive of an early mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma. The thymic epithelial network appeared well preserved by CK19 immunostaining. Clonality analysis was decisive in confirming the diagnostic suspect by showing monoclonal rearrangement of IGH gene. Conclusion: Thymic Malt lymphomas are very rare and frequently the proliferation destroys the epithelial network leaving only epithelial remnants and/or rare lymphoepithelial lesions. We suggest that this case of thymic florid FH represents an early phase of a thymic MALT lymphoma. Objective: Mast cells play some roles in tumour progression via increasing angiogenesis. Some proteases such as tryptase and chymase are stored in the mast cell granules. The roles of mast cells have been demonstrated in various biologic processes in the many tumours. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the relationship of tryptase and chymase in prostatic adenocarcinomas (PA). Method: This study was conducted on a total of 51 paraffin-embedded prostatic adenocarcinomas samples, which were histopathologically diagnosed at the Department of Pathology of medicine Hospital between 2012 and 2014. Paraffin-embedded PA samples 3 \u03bcm in thickness, were then cut. The slides were stained with tryptase and chymase. Results: MCC was observed that tumoural areas more acumulate than nontumoural areas (respectively; mean:18,63 \u00b1 16,268, mean: 15, 47 \u00b1 16,268). MCT was more acumulated than MCC in tumoural and nontumoural areas. MCT was observed that nontumoural areas more acumulate than tumoural areas (respectively; mean: 49,12 \u00b1 19,499, mean: 46,53 \u00b1 18,575) . Objective: Several investigators have suggested the possibility that expression of both EGFR and HER2 could be utilized for molecular targeted therapy in urinary bladder cancer. We tried to evaluate the expression of HER2 and EGFR in urinary bladder cancer. Method: We collected 41 paraffin-embedded urothelial caricinoma tissue blocks from 35 patients. HER2, EGFR, MIB1 and phospho-AKT1, 2, 3 at Thr308 expression was studied using tissue microarrays. The immunohistochemical results correlated with conventional clinicopathological parameters. Results: The majority of the infiltrative tumours were of high grade (p = 0.007) and >2 cm in gratest diameter (p < 0.001). This study revealed EGFR and HER2 overexpression in 26.8 and 56.1 % of the cases respectively. HER2 expression was observed mainly in high grade tumours (p = 0.023) with high MIB1 proliferative index (p = 0.009). EGFR expression was associated with tumour size and HER2 expression (p = 0.044). pAKT-Thr308 expressed in a large percentage of cells in all cases and was associated with tumour infiltration (p = 0.012). Conclusion: pAKT-Thr308 is commonly overexpressed in urothelial carcinomas independently the tumour grade or size. We have noticed positivity of EGFR and HER2 in a considerable amount of the cases. HER2 is overexpressed in high-grade tumours with high mitotic index but HER2/EGFR coexpression is not associated with adverse prognostic parameters.",

            "text": "The effect of histopathological parameters and prognostic factors to biochemical recurrence in radical prostatectomies Objective: Preoperative PSA levels became very important in addition to many histological parameters such as Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, involvement of vesiculoseminalis, status of lymph nodes and surgical margins in predicting prognosis of prostate cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between biochemical recurrence and preoperative PSA level, Gleason score, tumour volume, surgical margin status, extraprostatic extension and other histopathological features in prostate cancer. Method: A total of 117 cases diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma and treated by RP were included in this study. The relations between all of the histopathological parameters were studied in addition to the preoperative PSA levels, biochemical recurrence and follow up time up to recurrence. Results: Preoperative PSA, Gleason score, tumour volume, extraprostatic extension, perineural invasion, positive surgical margins, vascular invasion, necrosis, vesiculoseminalis involvement, ganglionic involvement and high grade tertiary pattern was found to be related to recurrence. Age, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraluminal mucus, collagenous micronodules and foamy cytoplasmic change was unrelated to prognosis. Conclusion: Our findings support that reporting histopathological features such as Gleason score, tumour volume, extraprostatic extension, tumour positive surgical margins, perineural and vascular invasion, necrosis, vesiculoseminalis involvement, ganglion involvement and tertiary pattern can be helpful in predicting prognosis in prostatic adenocarcinomas. Objective: Sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma is a rare neoplasm of the urinary bladder, defined as a biphasic tumour consisting of malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components, with an incidence ranging 0.2-4.3 %. Method: Twenty-seven cases of sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinomas (~0.5 % of all urothelial carcinomas) were retrieved from the authors' affiliated pathology archives. The cases were analyzed for the tumour stage, grade, microscopic and immunohistochemical characteristics. Results: The study included 18 male and 9 female patients, with the mean age of 67.2 years. All tumours were high grade. Invasion of the muscularis propria (pT2) or perivesical fatty tissue (pT3) was present in 23/24 (95.83 %) cases. The most common epithelial component was urothelial carcinoma with focal areas of glandular (8/27 = 29.6 %), squamous (7/27 = 26 %) and neuroendocrine (3/27 = 11.11 %) differentiation. Rhabdomyosarcoma (6/27 = 22.22 %) was the most frequent mesenchymal component followed by chondrosarcoma (3/27 = 11.11 %), osteosarcoma (2/27 = 7.04 %) and fibrosarcoma (1/27 = 3.70 %). Immunohistochemically epithelial elements expressed cytokeratins, whereas stromal elements reacted with vimentin or specific markers corresponding to the mesenchymal differentiation. Areas of neuroendocrine differentiation expressed synaptophysin and chromogranin A. Conclusion: Sarcomatoid variant of urothelial carcinoma is a rare, high grade variant of urothelial carcinoma that presents at advanced stage in the majority of the patients. Objective: Xanthogranulomatous change has been reported to occur at many different sites, including the colon, ovary, pancreas, salivary gland, appendix, gallbladder, endometrium, brain and kidney. However, it is rarely reported in the bladder. Xanthogranulomatous cystitis is a rare benign chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. Method: We report a case of xanthogranulomatous cystitis. Results: A 38-year-old woman was presented with 1 week history of lower abdominal pain. She had not experience any fever and did not have any lower urinary tract symptoms. A physical examination was unremarkable. Ultrasonography and cystoscopy revealed a nodular mass of 32 \u00d7 30 mm protruding from the anterior bladder wall. Partial cystectomy was performed. A histological examination of the specimen was consistent with xanthogranulomatous cystitis. The bladder muscularis propria was replaced by sheets of foamy histiocytes and chronic inflammatory cells ( Figure A) . Multinucleated giant cells and cholesterol clefts were also identified ( Figure B ). Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, which characterize malacoplakia, were not observed. There was no evidence of malignancy. Conclusion: Xanthogranulomatous cystitis can mimic a tumour by way of its clinical and radiologic presentation. Definitive diagnosis is by microscopic analysis and exclusion of similiar process, such as malacoplakia. This report should enhance our knowledge in diagnostic pathology. Objective: Basal cell hyperplasia of the prostate is a relatively common finding in specimens removed from patients with urinary obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. This condition was thought to be arising from basal/reserve cells and characterized by multi-layering cells within the glands. Basal cell proliferative lesion revealed a wide spectrum, ranging from benign condition to malignant tumours. Method: Basal cell proliferative lesion revealed a wide spectrum, ranging from benign condition to malignant tumours. Results: However, the criteria defining malignancy within this entity is ill-defined and the diagnosis of basal cell proliferative lesion is sometimes challenging. Conclusion: We present a case of tumour-like proliferation of atypical basaloid cells which was incidentally found in a prostatectomy specimen that otherwise contained a conventional acinar adenocarcinoma. Objective: SDF-1/CXCR4/CXCR7 axis is associated with progression of prostate adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression on the clinicopathologic characteristics of prostate adenocarcinoma. Method: Immunohistochemical stain of CXCR4 and CXCR7 was done in tissue microarray slides containing 365 Korean prostate adenocarcinoma samples. Results: Both CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression were higher in tumours with Gleason grade \u22647 than those with Gleason grade \u22658. And they were also higher in tumours without biochemical recurrence (BCR) than those with BCR. BCR was associated with age (OR, 0.87-0.97), Gleason grade (OR, 2.0-4.5), surgical margin involvement (OR, 1.2-3.0), and tumour volume (OR, 1.0-1.1). However it was not associated with pre-operative PSA level, extraprostatic extension, CXCR4, or CXCR7 expression. Tumours with high CXCR4 expression were associated with lower BCR rate than those with low CXCR4 expression. However, CXCR7 expression was not associated with BCR rate. The expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 was positively correlated (r = 0.61, p < 0.01). Conclusion: High expression of CXCR4 was associated with lower BCR rate in prostate adenocarcinoma. However, CXCR7 expression was not Method: Three male patients (68, 69 and 74 year-old) presented to our hospital with ematuria, disuria and lower abdominal pain. The first patient had a personal history of papillary urothelial carcinoma. The second patient had undergone BCG intravescical injections for an invasive urothelial carcinoma. The third patient had no previous history. All three patients underwent transurethral resection, in the last two patients followed by a radical cystoprostatectomy and a regional lymphadenectomy. In all cases imaging studies ruled out metastatic disease. Results: Microscopically neoplastic cells were organized in sheets and nests. They showed nuclear crowding and molding, scant cytoplasm inconspicuous nucleoli and finely stippled cromatin. Geographic necrosis, frequent mitoses and invasion of the bladder's muscle were present. The third patient had a coexistent urothelial carcinoma in situ. Immunoistochemistry showed positivity for CKAE1/AE3 (focally dotlike), Synaptophysin, Chromogranin A, CD56 and negativity for TTF-1, LCA, p63. Conclusion: Although morphology is crucial, immunoistochemistry confirms the diagnosis of SCC offering assistance to the differential diagnosis from lymphoma, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, plasmatocytoid carcinoma and poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma. Clinicopathological correlation is important to exclude metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Objective: Little is known with certainty about the role of p53 or MDM2 in predicting prognosis and survival of renal cancer. The present study aimed to determine the value of P53 and MDM2 overexpression to predict 5-year survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma in Iran. Method: Ninety one patients with kidney cancer referred to Hasheminejad Kidney Center between 2007 and 2009 and underwent radical nephrectomy were included. Immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour samples were performed. The 5-year survival was determined by the telephone following-up. Results: Totally, 4.4 % of all samples were revealed to be positive for P53. Also, 20.8 % of all samples were revealed to be positive for MDM2. The patients were all followed for 5 years. According to the Cox proportional hazard analysis, positive P53 marker was only predictor for patients' 5-year survival that the presence of positive p53 increased the risk for long-term mortality up to 2.8 times (HR = 2.798, 95 %CI: 1.176-6.660, P = 0.020). However, the presence of MDM2 could not predict long-term mortality. Conclusion: The simultaneous presence of both P53 and MDM2 markers in our population is a rare phenomenon and the presence of these markers may not predict long-term survival in patients who undergoing radical nephrectomy.",

Kuroda * * Kochi Red Cross Hospital, Dept. of Diagnostic Pathology, JapanObjective: I investigated the usefulness of TFE3 gene break apart FISH in the diagnosis of Xp11.2 renal cell carcinoma in the consultation service in my hospital.Method: I collected six cases of renal tumours suspected of Xp11.2 renal cell carcinoma between January and April, 2015. The age of patients ranged from 12 to 49 years with a mean age of 20 years. The sex ratio was equal. Six tumours were obtained from 2 biopsied and 4 surgical resected materials. The immunohistochemistry of TFE3 protein and the break apart FISH of TFE3 gene was performed for all tumours. The cutoff value for FISH was more than 10 %. Results: Regarding immunohistochemistry, five tumours showed positivity for TFE3 protein with more than 2+ intensity and the positive range of 2 to 90 %. One tumour was negative. With regard to FISH, three tumours were considered to be positive. One tumour was unsuccessful for FISH. Two tumours were negative. Conclusion: The break apart FISH of TFE3 gene is available in the final diagnosis of Xp11.2 renal cell carcinoma. Objective: To present a case of an infrequent lesion of the urinary bladder. Method: A 70-year-old man was surgically treated at the Clinic for Urology of the Clinical Center of Vojvodina due to an exophytic round lesion of the urinary bladder. Hematuria and irritative bladder symptoms were present. The clinical diagnosis was urothelial carcinoma in situ. After the adequate preparation of the patient, transurethral surgical excision of the lesion was done. Results: Having performed a thorough histological examination with routine Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, the diagnosis of villous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia was given. Microscopically, it showed papillary-villiform architecture covered with columnar epithelium with intracellular acid mucin. Conclusion: Villous adenoma is a rare benign neoplasm of the urinary bladder, typically with a papillary-villiform growth pattern, that is histologically indistinguishable from similar neoplasms of the colon and rectum. This kind of neoplasm is mostly seen in middle-aged and senile males with hematuria and irritative bladder symptoms. Prognosis of this neoplasia is good and the transurethral resection is the only necessary treatment. It should be considered as an important lesion because of malignancy potential. Excision and histological analysis of the entire change is recommended in order to exclude the existence of focus adenocarcinoma. Objective: Paget's disease (PD) of the penis is an uncommon condition which may be associated with underlying in situ or invasive malignancy. We are describing a case of PD of the glans penis related to the urothelial carcinoma of the penile urethra which presented 5 years after a completion urethrectomy. Method: We describe the clinical history, gross description and the histology of the penectomy specimen. We also describe the clinicopathologic features of urothelial carcinoma of the penile urethra associated with paget's disease of glans penis, including the immunohistochemical features. Results: Grossly; a cystic lesion was present within the glans. Histology showed this cystic space to be lined by urothelium displaying carcinoma in situ and possible invasive foci.

            "text": "Objective: Testicular germ cell tumours (GCTs) of adolescents and adults are the most common malignancies occurring in males between 20 and 40 years. GCTs account for 90 to 95 % of all primary testicular tumours and are divided into two major groups, seminomatous and nonseminomatous (NSGCT). BORIS (Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites, a paralogue of the transcription factor CTCF) is a member of the cancertestis antigen gene family, although aberrantly expressed in various malignancies and cancer cell lines. Our objective was to examine BORIS expression in various testicular GCTs. Objective: We present a very rare case of mucinous borderline tumour of the testis. According to our knowledge, mucinous testicular tumours are reported in less than 30 cases. It was postulated that ovarian -type epithelial tumours of testis derive from occult ovarian tissue, M\u00fcllerian remnants or monodermal teratoma. Method: Routine histological and histochemical examinations were performed. Results: Testicular tumour was diagnosed in 46-year-old man complaining dull arching scrotal pain and right testicular swelling of few years duration and umbilical hernia. Gross examination showed unilocular cystic tumour measuring 105 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 75 mm with smooth gray surface. Sections revealed honeycombing and calcifications within cystic wall but without obvious residual testicular tissue. Luminal surface showed smooth and focal papillary excrescences and the content was brownish mucin. The tumour compressed tunica albuginea with no infiltration of epididymis and spermatic cord. Microscopic examination revealed highly atypical papillary mucinous epithelium with no stromal infiltration but only mucinous pseudoinvasion in foci. There was a microfocus of chondroid change which can lead to consideration of teratomatous origin of the tumour. Cystic wall showed fibroxanthomatous inflammation with foci of sclerocalcification and cholesterol crystals. Conclusion: Distinguishing borderline mucinous testicular tumour from carcinoma is of great importance and could represent a significant diagnostic challenge. Objective: Advances in the understanding of the genetics have lead to the recognition of distinctive types of renal. Renal oncocytoma is a benign neoplasm that sometimes is difficult to distinguish from chromophobe cell renal carcinoma.

Gonzalez Peramato * Hospital Universitario La Paz, Dept. of Surgical Pathology, Madrid, SpainObjective: Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of the kidney (MTSCC) is a very uncommon neoplasm recently included in the WHO classification. It has a slight middle-age female preponderance. Method: 48-year-old smoker female with a history of HLA27+ ankylosis spondylitis under chronic NSAID, steroids and immunomodulators treatment who presented microscopic hematuria as an incidental finding and the renal ultrasound showed a well defined and hyperechoic right renal mass. Results: Gross examination showed a partially encapsulated, yellowish and bland mass that measured 8 cm with a nodular, elastic and brownish area. Microscopically the tumour was close to the medulla, had an expansive growth patter and a polymorphic appearience. It was composed of tubules lined by cuboidal cells and were mixed with low grade spindle cells separated by a variable amount of mucinous-mixoid stroma. Some other areas showed a tubulopapillary pattern. Conclusion: MTSCC's histogenesis has been suggested as the loop of Henle or collecting duct but it is still unclear. MSTSCC shares histological, cytogenetic and immunochemistry features with the papillary renal carcinoma and even though its low aggressiveness, low tumour metastatic potential and good prognosis are still controversial, its recognition and correct classification is necessary specially in exceptional morphologic cases such as this one presented. Objective: Metanephric adenoma (MA) of the kidney is an uncommon benign epithelial tumour. Less than 100 cases are reported in the literature. It occurs in female adults at any age. It's sometimes difficult to distinguish it from papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). The aim of our study is to discuss the radiological and pathological features of this rare tumour. Method: We report the case of a 22 year-old women who presented with left flank pain with fever. The scanner CT showed a superior polar cystic tumour of the left kidney. A local tumour resection was performed. Results: Macroscopically, it was a 3.5 cm, well-circumscribed and non encapsulated tumour. Histologically, the tumour proliferation was densely cellular with slit-like spaces, acinar and glomeroid structures. Numerous psammoma bodies were noted. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that tumour cells were negative for CK7, EMA and Racemase. The immunostaining for WT1 was also negative with a positive control. The diagnosis of MA was made.The patient remains disease free 7 months after surgery. Our case is unique by the absence of expression of WT1 inspite of characteristic morphologic features. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical staining is useful to differentiate between MA and PRCC. The treatment is based on total nephrectomy or partial resection. Objective: Adult granulosa cell tumours of the testis (AGCTT) are classified as sex cord-stromal tumours. Only 34 cases have been reported. We add this rare case. Method: A 40-year-old male presented with complaint of mild pain in both testicles. A testicular ultrasound revealed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm hypoechoic lesion within the left testicle. A radical orchiectomy was performed.Histologicaly the lesion were composed of granulose cells in a predominantly microfollicular pattern, although trabecular and insular patterns were present. The microfollicles were filled with eosinophilic secretions characteristic of Call-Exner bodies. The surrounding granulosa cell nuclei were generally oval in shape with occasional nuclear grooves. Scattered mitotic figures were present without appreciable atypia. The lesion had a thin fibrous capsule and was non-infiltrative. The tumour cells showed strong membrane and cytoplasmic staining for inhibin and vimentine. Results: Given the histopathologic findings, as well as the immunohistochemistry, the patient was diagnosed with AGCTT. Conclusion: AGCTT is a rare tumour and information regarding its presentation, gross and microscopic morphology, and immunohistochemical characteristics is lacking. This report provides an update of the immunohistochemical findings and adds to the available data concerning this tumour. Objective: Urothelial carcinomas are heterogeneous lesions which show different histological features. The recognition of the morphological variants is important because of the diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic implications thay have. Method: We analyzed 77 cases of high grade invasive urothelial cancers of urinary bladder out of 106 received in our institution as endoscopically or surgically obtained material in 2 years. Transurethrally resected (TUR) material was completely embedded and standard dissection of operative material was performed. Immunostains were used in 12 cases with atypical morphology. * Hopital FSI La Marsa, Dept. of Pathology, Tunisia",

            "text": "Objective: Eosinophilic cystitis (EC) is a rare inflammatory pathology of the bladder wall which physiopathology remains controversial. It occurs most often in women and children with allergic condition and hyper-eosinophilia. Less commonly, this pathology is found in cases of non-allergic patients particularly in elderly men with urological past history. Our aim is to study the clinico-pathological features of a pseudotumoral EC case. Method: We report the case of a 60-years old Tunisian man, presenting with dysuria since few months. Cystoscopy showed a bladder tumour measuring 1 cm in diameter. Histopathological examination showed a dense inflammatory infiltrate of the bladder wall made of eosinophils. No tumour proliferation was found. Results: The final diagnosis was pseudotumoral EC. Conclusion: EC is a rare disease having variable clinical and endoscopic manifestations. Pseudotumoral form is very rare and is misleading at endoscopic examination. Histology is mandatory to rectify the diagnosis. ",
