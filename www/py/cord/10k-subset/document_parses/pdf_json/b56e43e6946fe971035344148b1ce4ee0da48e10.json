This paper focused on two aims: (i) identification of school academic recovery trajectories; and (ii) examination of potential risk factors associated with these trajectories. We used latent class growth analysis to identify school academic recovery trajectories for a cohort of 462 Texas public schools that were in the path of Hurricane Ike in 2008. Using Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) data from 2005 to 2011, we found that attendance and percent of economically disadvantaged youth emerged as significant risk factors for two identified academic recovery trajectories (High-Stable and Low-Interrupted). Higher levels of economically disadvantaged youth were associated with lower likelihood of falling in the High-Stable trajectory, relative to the Low-Interrupted trajectory. Higher levels of attendance were associated with higher likelihood of membership in the High-Stable trajectory, relative to the Low-Interrupted trajectory. These findings are consistent with the notion that disasters do not affect all people or communities equally. Findings highlight the need for policy initiatives that focus on low performing schools, as these schools are at highest risk for adverse outcomes postdisaster.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "KEY WORDS: disaster recovery, schools, social vulnerability, disaster recovery, public health preparedness", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Trayectorias de recuperaci on escolar despu es de un desastre natural: factores de riesgo y protecci on Los desastres pueden tener un impacto significativo y duradero en los programas educativos y el rendimiento acad emico, sin embargo, la examinaci on de los diferentes patrones de recuperaci on escolar despu es de los desastres es poco estudiada.

Related indicators and data associated with student achievement are regularly collected by school districts, and thus may readily be examined in future studies of school academic recovery. To illustrate, students who miss class time at higher rates than their peers are more susceptible to falling behind academically, particularly low-income students (Chang & Romero, 2008; Morrissey, Hutchison, & Winsler, 2014; Romero & Lee, 2007) .

Yet in Galveston, Texas, where Hurricane Ike made landfall, student enrollment fell by 20 percent immediately after the hurricane, largely due to families evacuating the region.

However, Baggerly and Ferretti (2008) conducted a thorough literature review, which provides initial evidence for multiple patterns of school recovery. They reported that some schools (exact numbers not included) in areas with high hurricane impact reported higher scores post-hurricanes. Using a more in-depth presentation of information gleaned from newspapers, they noted that Peace River Elementary School reported that 56 percent of third grade students read at grade level before Hurricane Charley, while 80 percent were reading at grade level one year after. While unexpected, the authors suggested that this could have occurred because schools provided a \"refuge\" from the chaos, and students may have studied more in order to avoid thinking about hurricane damage.

In growth mixture modeling, expectation maximization procedures are used to identify recovery patterns in the data. Growth mixture modeling identifies groups of schools that are similar in their underlying (latent) recovery patterns and different from other groups of schools in their recovery patterns (i.e., growth mixture modeling allows for an examination of inter-school differences in intraschool change over time). This distinguishes growth mixture modeling from variable centered approaches, which focus on relationships between variables instead of groups. Models with differing numbers of patterns (e.g., models with one, two, three recovery patterns) are examined.

The Accountability Indicator refers to the TAKS measure used by the TEA in assessing school performance (TEA, 2005a) . This measure was calculated as the percentage of all TAKS tests administered at one school (across all subjects and all grades within the school) that received a scale score of 2100 or higher-or that \"Met Standard,\" or \"passed\" (TEA, 2005a). For example, in a school with grades K-5, the accountability indicator would be calculated as follows 1 : Number of students who passed Mathematics TAKS in grades 3; 4; and 5 \u00fe Number of students who passed Reading TAKS in grades 3; 4; and 5", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 142, "text": "(TEA, 2005a)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measures"}, {"text": "\u00fe Number of students who passed Writing TAKS in grade 4 \u00fe Number of students who passed Science TAKS in grade 5 Number of students who took Mathematics TAKS in grades 3; 4; and 5 \u00fe Number of students who took Reading TAKS in grades 3; 4; and 5", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measures"}, {"text": "\u00fe Number of students who took Writing TAKS in grade 4 \u00fe Number of students who took Science TAKS in grade 5", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Measures"}, {"text": "Risk Factors.

He suggested that \"there is no such thing as a natural disaster\" because pre-existing vulnerabilities interact with natural phenomena to produce the disaster effects. Others have also found support for this idea. For example, the \"growth recovery machine\" thesis suggests differential recovery of neighborhoods based on their pre-disaster socioeconomic status (SES) (Pais & Elliott, 2008) ; high SES neighborhoods are more resilient, given access to more resources available to recover, than low SES neighborhoods, leading to a relatively more robust recovery in higher SES neighborhoods. Less advantageous location and poor building quality are inextricably tied to lower SES neighborhoods, where recovery is slower (Bolin & Stanford, 1998; Peacock, Van Zandt, Zhang, & Highfield, 2014; Stough, 2010; Weber & Lichtenstein, 2015) , as evidenced by Hurricane Ike, which was reported to have created more damage in low-value than high-value homes in Galveston, Texas (Peacock et al., 2014; Van Zandt & Sloan, 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 345, "end": 357, "text": "Smith (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 795, "end": 817, "text": "(Pais & Elliott, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1170, "text": "(Bolin & Stanford, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1216, "text": "Peacock, Van Zandt, Zhang, & Highfield, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1230, "text": "Stough, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1258, "text": "Weber & Lichtenstein, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1416, "text": "(Peacock et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1441, "text": "Van Zandt & Sloan, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Several limitations to this work should be noted.

Future research that can examine academic performance by subject areas (e.g., Mathematics, Science, English) is needed. In addition, our study focused on schools as a critical institution post-disaster. Although important, future research should integrate student, school, and district level information to shed light on how different levels of the overall school environment interact. Further, this study sample included a broad and diverse range of schools, which is an important contribution to the literature. However, the sample was limited to schools in Texas. Findings need to be tested for replication across other locations and after other disasters. Finally, our examination of race and ethnicity was limited in this paper to an examination of percentage of minority students within schools.

Overall the evidence points to the need for additional policy focusing on low SES groups, which suffer hardships both in housing recovery and educational outcomes after disaster. Absenteeism, which has been found to be an important factor in student performance, can be exacerbated by slow economic recovery in low SES areas. Therefore, public policy should reflect these needs and assign additional resources to low SES areas after disaster.

Pre-disaster preparedness, response planning, and policy initiatives can in turn be customized to minimize effects of natural disasters on school academic functioning. Further, the methodology developed here may be generalized for use after other disasters in other states (as well as other disasters in Texas). Thus, this work has the potential to transform future studies of disaster impacts on school functioning and improve cross-study and cross-model examinations of disaster impacts that inform disaster policy and education policy practitioners.
