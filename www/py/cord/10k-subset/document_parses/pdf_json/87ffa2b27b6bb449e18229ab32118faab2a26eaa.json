In addition, they can cause amoebic keratitis in contact lens wearers. Acanthamoeba GAE is almost always fatal because of difficulty and delay in diagnosis and lack of optimal antimicrobial therapy. Here, we report the description of an unusual strain isolated from skin and brain of a GAE patient. The amoebae displayed large trophozoites and star-shaped cysts, characteristics for acanthamoebas belonging to morphology Group 1. However, its unique morphology and growth characteristics differentiated this new strain from other Group 1 species. DNA sequence analysis, secondary structure prediction, and phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene confirmed that this new strain belonged to Group 1, but that it was distinct from the other sequence types within that group. Thus, we hereby propose the establishment of a new species, Acanthamoeba byersi n. sp. as well as a new sequence type, T18, for this new strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Group 1 Acanthamoeba that is indisputably pathogenic in humans.",

Groups 2 and 3 acanthamoebas have smaller trophozoites compared to Group 1 and cysts smaller than 18 lm in size. Amoebae belonging to Group 2 cause the majority of reported human infections (both AK and Acanthamoeba GAE) and also constitute the majority of the strains isolated from the environment.

However, identification at the species level is problematic as species-specific morphologic features are ambiguous and may vary with culture conditions (Visvesvara 1991) . Group 1 is generally considered to include five species, Group 2 as many as 10 different species, and Group 3 up to five species, but several of them may be synonyms and some strains are likely to have been assigned to the wrong species due to ambiguous identification. As a complement to the morphologic classification, molecular analyses using nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene sequences have divided Acanthamoeba into 17 sequence types (designated T1-T17, also called ribotypes or genotypes) (Corsaro and Venditti 2010; Gast 2001; Gast et al. 1996; Hewett et al. 2003; Horn et al. 1999; Nuprasert et al. 2010; Stothard et al. 1998) . In some cases, the ribosomal sequence types correlate very well with the morphologically derived species designations (e.g. the association of sequence type T5 with Acanthamoeba lenticulata) while other species, especially the ones belonging to Group 2, are polyphyletic (Stothard et al. 1998) .",

In mid-December, he developed skin lesions on his chest wall and posterior right lower extremity. At the end of January 2010, he was admitted to the hospital because of suspected rejection. A punch biopsy of the right chest lesion showed large mononuclear cells with prominent, centrally located nucleoli, consistent with amoebae. One week into his hospitalization, the patient became increasingly altered and agitated. CT and MRI scans revealed brain lesions consistent with meningoencephalitis. Granulomatous amebic encephalitis caused either by Balamuthia mandrillaris or Acanthamoeba species was suspected and the patient was started on a broad range of antimicrobials. Despite intensive treatment, the patient deteriorated and was declared brain dead in early February, 2010. Samples of the punch biopsy of the skin, a CSF sample collected 1 wk before death, and skin and brain tissue samples obtained at autopsy were forwarded to CDC and processed for culture, immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) staining, and real-time PCR. Immunofluorescent antibody staining of the punch biopsy was positive for Acanthamoeba. DNA extracted from all types of specimens tested positive for Acanthamoeba in a triplex real-time PCR assay that detects Acanthamoeba spp., B. mandrillaris, and Naegleria fowleri.",

Amoebae grew on the agar plate, ingested bacteria, and multiplied. In about a week, when all the bacteria were gone, the amoebae differentiated into double-walled cysts. The amoebae grew well on the HLF cell culture and destroyed the monolayer within a week. It produced cytopathic effect (CPE) beginning on day 2 of inoculation. The CPE consisted of shrinkage of cell cytoplasm, nuclear pycnosis, and discontinuity of cell sheet resulting in the complete destruction of the cell sheet in about a week. The amoebae grew well at 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C in the PYGS medium. The amoebae could also grow at 40\u00b0C on agar plate coated with bacteria, indicating that they are thermotolerant and have the ability to survive high fever that may occur in patients with GAE. The amoebae when examined under a phase contrast microscope measured 50-125 lm and exhibited large blunt thorn-like processes, acanthopodia ( Fig. 1) , from the surface of the body, a feature that is characteristic of Acanthamoeba. The cysts measured 20-35 lm with a smooth, almost round outer wall, the ectocyst, and a thicker, inner cyst wall, the endocyst. The endocysts were mostly star-shaped with five to eight arms or rays, although polygonal endocysts were occasionally seen (Fig. 2) . The endocyst was widely separated from the ectocyst except at points where the rays contacted the ectocyst at different planes. The tips of the rays at the contact point appeared to be thick and crescent-shaped and seemed to plug a pore, the ostiole. The crescent-shaped plug, the operculum, was removed when the amoeba exited the cyst (Fig. 2) . On the basis of these features, the amoebae were identified as Acanthamoeba sp. Group 1 and designated as CDC:V621.",

Despite the sequence variability among the clones, similarity searches via the GenBank server produced the same results for all the clones: the highest similarity (approximately 95%) to Acanthamoeba strains E1 and E9, belonging to the newly described T17 sequence type, followed by A. tubiashi strain ATCC 30867 (89% similarity) and A. comandoni isolates (86-88% similarity).",

The Acanthamoeba infection in our patient was identified by immunofluorescence testing using rabbit antibodies to Acanthamoeba as well as real-time PCR performed on tissues (D'Auria et al. 2012) . Culture isolation of the amoeba from skin and brain tissues was successful and yielded an Acanthamoeba strain designated CDC:V621. This new strain exhibited large trophozoites and cysts characteristic for the Group 1 Acanthamoeba.

            "text": "Acanthamoeba-specific PCR primers were used to amplify the 18S rRNA gene from CDC:V621; although single bands of the expected size could be seen on agarose gels following amplification, direct DNA sequencing of obtained PCR products failed due to overlapping peaks in the sequence electropherogram. This is a typical result when there is a mixture of two or more distinct PCR products in the amplified reaction. As discussed in a previous publication, the most likely explanation for this is the sequence variability among the many copies of the ribosomal gene within individual amoebae (Stothard et al. 1998) . Acanthamoeba castellanii Neff strain appears to have 700 copies of the 18S rRNA gene in its genome (Byers et al. 1990 ) and it is reasonable that other Acanthamoeba contain numerous copies as well. The presence of micro-heterogeneity at the 18S rRNA gene level has been detected in strains from all three morphology groups, including Group 1 (Nuprasert et al. 2010; Stothard et al. 1998 ). An alternative explanation for the sequence difference between the clones, errors produced by the Taq polymerase, may have contributed to some of the point mutations seen in the clones but cannot account for the majority of sequence variation, especially in clones 1 and 6. Thus, we conclude that CDC:V621 has several distinct alleles of the 18S rRNA gene. The greatest sequence difference observed between the clones was 1.7%. Most of the differences were represented as deletions, insertions, or transitions; only three transversions occurred, of which two were in stem 49. Variations between alleles of ribosomal RNA genes in amoebae can be quite substantial. For example, in the amoeba Vannella epipetala the difference between 11 clones was as high as 3.8% (Amaral-Zettler et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "Previous studies using DNA sequencing analysis of the 18S rRNA gene have identified 17 sequence types and these are designated T1-T17. Based on phylogenetic analysis of 18 strains belonging to morphology Groups 2 and 3, Gast et al. (1996) divided the strains into four sequence types (T1-T4) and defined a sequence type as sequences with at least 6% difference from members of the other sequence types. A subsequent study including more sequences from all three morphology groups established the presence of eight additional sequence types (T5-T12) and adjusted the sequence difference threshold between the sequence types to 5% (Stothard et al. 1998 ). This arbi- trary number of 5% dissimilarity has since been used to create five additional sequence types (T13-T17) (Corsaro and Venditti 2010; Gast 2001; Hewett et al. 2003; Horn et al. 1999; Nuprasert et al. 2010) . The vast majority of Acanthamoeba isolates from the environment as well as isolates associated with human infections belong to sequence type T4 (Booton et al. 2005; Maciver et al. 2013) . In contrast, isolation of Acanthamoeba with Group 1 morphological features is rare. Three species of Group 1 Acanthamoeba, namely A. astronyxis, A. tubiashi, and A. comandoni, belong to sequence types T7, T8, and T9, respectively. The fourth species classified as Group 1, Acanthamoeba echinulata, has not yet been associated with a sequence type as no 18S rRNA gene sequence from that species is available in public databases. Recently, two environmental isolates were found to exhibit Group 1 morphology, but as their 18S rRNA genes differed more than 12% from all known Acanthamoeba sequences, a new sequence type, designated T17, was created for them and added to Group 1 (Nuprasert et al. 2010) . The DNA sequences obtained from the amoebae CDC:V621 were approximately 4.3% dissimilar from the T17 strains. Although this is slightly lower than 5% sequence divergence, the phylogenetic analysis clearly distinguishes CDC:V621 as a separate lineage with an evolutionary distance of 2.7% from the T17 strains. Therefore, we consider CDC:V621 as a new and unique sequence type and identified it as sequence type T18. The proposed secondary structure of the 18S rRNA molecule from CDC:V621 presents some unique features, especially the new stem identified between stems E23-13 and E23-14. An extra stem in this region has previously been identified in another amoeba, Corallomyxa tenera, and was given the designation E23-13-1 (Tekle et al. 2007 20-42 base pairs. In contrast, Acanthamoeba belonging to Groups 2 and 3 have either no or a considerably smaller E23-13-2 stem, containing less than 18 bases. In addition, the CDC:V621 amoeba had extra stems and bifurcated stems in other regions of the ribosomal RNA molecule similar to other Group 1 acanthamoebas and distinct from Groups 2 and 3 acanthamoebas. Thus, the secondary structure prediction of the 18S rRNA provides additional support for the placement of CDC:V621 in Group 1 Acanthamoeba. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a Group 1 Acanthamoeba that is indisputably pathogenic in humans. Acanthamoeba astronyxis has been suggested to have caused human infections in one case where it was cultured from the CSF of a patient with encephalitic syndrome, but the patient recovered without any anti-Acanthamoeba medication (Callicott 1968) . It is believed that the isolation was probably due to contamination (Martinez 1980 ). The Acanthamoeba isolate described here, however, caused a devastating cutaneous and CNS infection leading to the death of the patient.",

Therefore, we establish CDC:V621 as a new species, and propose its diagnosis as follows.",

The amoeboid stage is flattened with prominent subpseudopodia that are flexible and thorn like with blunt tips, acanthopodia. Trophozoite with or without a uroid, the cyst is large, bounded by a double wall with an outer smooth, almost round ectocyst and an inner mostly stellate endocyst with five to eight arms in different planes touching the ectocyst. Flagellate stage not seen even after suspending in distilled water for 24 h. Growth in vitro. Grows well on agar plate coated with a Gram-negative bacterium such as E. coli at 30\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Also grows well in axenic medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, known to support growth of other Acanthamoeba strains, at 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. Also grows well on mammalian tissue cultures (e.g., HLF cell monolayer) at 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. The optimal growth temperature is 30\u00b0C. The amoeba produces CPEs on monolayers of HLF cells. The normal habitat of the amoeba is not known although the amoeba was isolated from the brain and skin tissues of a patient with typical symptoms of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis.",

Dr Byers was an active member and a tireless worker for the International Society of Protozoologists (now International Society of Protistologists) and responsible for proposing a the new name of The Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology, for the previously named Journal of Protozoology, to attract new interest and provide additional support for the flagging Journal of Protozoology. Dr Byers was responsible for organizing the first Acanthamoeba conference in 1978 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio as at that time the first few cases of AK were described. Now the conference is known as the International Meeting on the Biology and Pathogenicity of Free-Living Amoebae and includes all pathogenic free-living amoebae. Dr Byers was instrumental for using both nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal genes as targets for taxonomic classification and phylogenetic relationships of the genus Acanthamoeba. Dr Byers was a gifted teacher and a tireless research worker, a generous collaborator and a helpful friend of one of the authors (G.S.V.). Type species. Acanthamoeba byersi, n. sp.
