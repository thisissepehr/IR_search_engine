We explored a novel mechanism of TLR3 up-regulation that is induced by LPS-TLR4 signaling in a dose-and time-dependent manner in AM\u03a6 from C57BL/6 mice, while the LPS-induced TLR3 expression was significantly reduced in TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 and Myd88 \u2212/\u2212 mice and following pretreatment with a NF-\u03baB inhibitor. The enhanced TLR3 up-regulation in AM\u03a6 augmented the expression of cytokines and chemokines in response to sequential challenges with LPS and Poly I:C, a TLR3 ligand, which was physiologically associated with amplified AM\u03a6-induced PMN migration into lung alveoli. Our study demonstrates that the synergistic effect between TLR4 and TLR3 in macrophages is an important determinant in acute lung injury and, more importantly, that TLR3 up-regulation is dependent on TLR4-MyD88-NF-\u03baB signaling. These results raise the possibility that bacterial infections can induce sensitivity to viral infections, which may have important implications for the therapeutic manipulation of the innate immune system.",

ALI is characterized by increased vascular permeability caused by dysfunction of the alveolar-capillary membrane, lung edema, neutrophil-derived inflammation, and surfactant dysfunction 2 . During the course of ALI/ARDS, resident lung cells such as alveolar macrophages (AM\u03a6 ) are stimulated to release chemoattractants, which recruit inflammatory cells to migrate from the intravascular space across the endothelium and epithelium into the airspaces 3 .",

TLRs are among the most well-studied PRRs because of their ability to detect a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipids, proteins, lipoproteins, and nucleic acids 5,6 . To date, 10 human and 12 murine TLRs have been identified, and each TLR has a specific set of ligands. Specifically, TLR4 recognizes the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of gram-negative bacteria 7,8 , while TLR3 recognizes viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is a common intermediate of viral replication and a potent indicator of infection. TLR3 also responds to the synthetic analog polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) to induce type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production 9,10 . TLR3 is expressed on immune cells, including myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, as well as non-immune cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and neurons 11 . Macrophages express TLR3 both on their cell surface and in the early endosome. Although TLR3 on the cell surface participates in dsRNA recognition, TLR3-mediated signaling is initiated from the endosomal compartment 12,13 . In addition, RNA released from damaged cells or mRNA can also be recognized by TLR3 14, 15 . Several studies in TLR3-deficient mice have demonstrated that TLR3 participates in the generation of protective",

However, in AM\u03a6 from TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice, LPS failed to induce TLR3 expression ( Fig. 2A) , indicating that TLR4 signaling mediates the LPS-induced up-regulation of TLR3. All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, utilize MyD88, and TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway is the primary signaling pathway used to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines 17 . However, TLR4 can signal through both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways, and the MyD88-independent signaling for TLR4 results in the production of type I IFNs 18 . To address the role of MyD88 in mediating the LPS-TLR4-induced up-regulation of TLR3, LPS (1 \u03bc g/ml) was administered to AM\u03a6 from MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and TLR3 expression was assessed. As shown in Fig. 2A , MyD88 deficiency prevented LPS-induced up-regulation of TLR3. The changes in the mRNA expression of TLR3 are shown in Fig. 2B , and these results corresponded to the observed changes in protein expression. As shown in Fig. 2C , the localization of TLR3 was further investigated in AM\u03a6 by immunofluorescence. In the absence of LPS, TLR3 was found within small vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. TLR3-containing vesicles increased in a time-dependent manner in AM\u03a6 from WT mice, but not in TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 or Myd88 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and similar results were observed using quantitative PCR (Fig. 2D) . can occur in the presence of MyD88. NF-\u03ba B p65 was detected using nuclear protein extracts from AM\u03a6 to determine whether LPS-TLR4 up-regulation of TLR3 was the result of activation of NF-\u03ba B. As shown in Fig. 3A , in response to LPS in WT mice, the expression of NF-\u03ba B p65 increased at 2.5 h and reached a significant level at 4.5 h.

In WT mice, LPS (5 \u03bc g/g) or saline (SAL) was injected intratracheally at time 0 h, and 4 hours later, Poly I:C (5 \u03bc g/g) or SAL was injected. In TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 and TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, LPS was injected intratracheally (5 \u03bc g/g) at time 0 h, and Poly I:C (5 \u03bc g/g) was injected intratracheally at 4 h.

Additionally, MIP-2 mRNA expression was detected using RT-PCR (B), and qRT-PCR was used to detect MIP-2 mRNA expression in AM\u03a6 (D). \u03b2 -actin mRNA was used to normalize the value of MIP-2 mRNA expression.

            "text": "ALI is caused by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response that results from direct (aspiration, pneumonia, ventilation-induced lung injury, etc.) or indirect injury (sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, etc.), leading to the activation of AM\u03a6 and the sequestration of neutrophils 3 . Excessive recruitment of leukocytes is critical to the pathogenesis of ALI. Neutrophils are the first leukocytes to be recruited to sites of inflammation in response to chemokines released by activated AM\u03a6 36 . Specifically, stimulation of AM\u03a6 leads to the release of chemokines, which induce neutrophils to migrate from the intravascular space across the endothelium and epithelium into the airspaces 27 . According to the relative position of the cysteine residues, chemokines have been classified into four subfamilies (CXC, CC, C, and CX3C). Among these, MIP-2, which is also known as CXCL2, is thought to play a major role in mediating neutrophil recruitment 37 . Belperio J.A. et al. 38 found that lung expression of MIP-2 was correlated with lung injury and neutrophil sequestration during the pathogenesis of ventilation-induced lung injury, and CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice show a marked reduction in neutrophil sequestration and lung injury. Additionally, MIP-2 was shown to be up-regulated in the lungs and BALF of animals, which was associated with neutrophil accumulation in the lungs after LPS administration [39] [40] [41] . Furthermore, Villar J. et al. showed that a CXCL2 polymorphism is associated with better outcomes in patients with severe sepsis 42 . In the present study, we observed that LPS/TLR4 signaling up-regulated TLR3 expression in AM\u03a6 . This cross talk between TLR4 and TLR3 in AM\u03a6 resulted in the amplification of cytokine (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 ) and chemokine (MIP-2, MCP-1) expression in response to LPS and Poly I:C, which activate TLR4 and TLR3, respectively, and subsequently led to enhanced PMN sequestration into the lung, which was found to be correlated with ALI based on the assessment of alveolar-capillary permeability and histological sections of lung tissue. Thus, the present study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which LPS can induce AM\u03a6 to up-regulate TLR3 expression, through a TLR4-Myd88-NF-\u03ba B-dependent pathway, thereby sensitizing AM\u03a6 to TLR3 ligands and promoting enhanced lung inflammation (Fig. 8) .",

            "text": "In clinical scenarios, a variety of pathogens are involved in lung infections. In particular, viral infections are a significant risk factor for acquiring bacterial infections 43, 44 . TLR3 is thought to be a major mediator of the cellular response to viral infection, because it responds to dsRNA, a common by-product of viral replication 45 . TLR3 has been implicated in infections by mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), reoviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and influenza A virus (IAV) 9 . TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice are more resistant to lethal West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne ssRNA flavivirus, which causes human disease of variable severity 46 , and show reduced inflammation and lethality upon IAV infection 47, 48 . Thus, up-regulation of TLR3 may contribute to an increased lung immune response to viral infection following a bacterial infection. Despite the relatively well-known role of viral infections in promoting bacterial infections, it is still not clear whether bacterial infections also promote viral infections. Therefore, our results are the first to offer new insight into this topic. There is also a growing body of evidence showing that most patients have a mixture of bacterial and viral infection 49, 50 , and the cross talk between TLR4 and TLR3 induces a synergistic inflammatory response in cases of mixed infection. Cameron R.J. et al. 49 found that bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional increases in inflammatory markers and an exacerbation of disease severity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). TLR3 has been shown to respond to dsRNA, a replication intermediary for many viruses, but the heterologous RNA released from necrotic cells or that is generated by in vitro transcription, such as mRNA, also stimulates TLR3 signaling and induces immune activation. Indeed, Cavassani KA 15 observed TLR3 activation during experimental polymicrobial sepsis and ischemia gut injury in the absence of an exogenous viral stimulus, and TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice were protected from the lethal effects of sustained inflammation. Moreover, treatment with a TLR3 antibody could attenuate the tissue injury associated with gut ischemia and significantly decrease sepsis-induced mortality. Therefore, TLR3 serves as a regulator of the amplification of the immune response as well as an endogenous sensor of necrosis, independent of viral activation. Our study showed that up-regulation of TLR3 significantly amplified IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 , MCP-1, and MIP-2 expression, which then enhanced PMN migration and finally led to ALI.",

            "text": "TLR cross talk has obvious advantages for the host in protecting against infectious agents, because it enhances the initial immune reaction to pathogen infection and better primes the host for mounting a more robust adaptive immune response. The concept that multiple TLR-ligand interactions are required for effective host resistance to pathogens has important implications for the design of vaccinations and immunotherapies against infectious diseases. Several studies have convincingly shown the improved efficacy of treatment with multiple TLR ligands compared with single TLR ligands in stimulating cellular immune responses in vivo. For example, co-administration of poly I:C and CpG ODNs increased serum cytokine production in a mouse tumor model when compared to the administration of either of the ligands alone 51 . Bone-marrow-derived DCs exposed to both poly I:C and a TLR7 ligand more effectively stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses compared to DCs exposed to either TLR ligand alone 52 . These studies provide an important conceptual foundation to examine the protective efficacy of multiple TLR-ligand combinations in vaccines against infectious diseases. However, synergistic amplification of the inflammation response may be detrimental, because it can result in immune over-activation, which hampers immune homeostasis. As a consequence of an overactive response, the function of various organ systems may be compromised, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. Cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) are important components of the immune system because they act as messengers between cells, but they are also involved in many pathological aspects of the cascade leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and ultimately MODS. According to the two-hit hypothesis 53 , patients who survive the initial inflammatory insult may die following a relatively minor second event that would not normally be life-threatening. In this study, viral (poly I:C) stimulation as a relatively minor secondary insult, led to an exaggerated secondary inflammatory response. Thus, understanding the mechanism of this two-hit phenomenon may help to devise novel therapeutic strategies to prevent overwhelming and life-threatening inflammatory conditions such as septic shock and trauma-induced SIRS.",

TLR4 knockout (TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice, MyD88 knockout (MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice and TLR3 knockout (TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 ) were obtained from Dr. Billiar's lab at the University of Pittsburgh. All mice used are on a C57BL/6 background. All experimental protocols involving animals were approved by Institution Animals Care and Use Committee of Tongji and Pittsburgh University. The experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were 8-12 weeks of age at the time of experiments and were maintained on standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. Animals were anesthetized with 100 mg/ kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine administered intraperitoneally. Animals were intratracheally administered LPS (5 \u03bc g/g body wt; Escherichia coli O111:B4; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 50 \u03bc l of saline (SAL) or SAL at first time, then after 4 h intratracheally administered Poly I:C (5 \u03bc g/g body wt; 31852-29-6; Invivogen) in 50 \u03bc l of saline (SAL) or SAL alone at the second time using a MicroSpray syringe. The animals were randomly in one of four groups: SAL/SAL, SAL/Poly I:C, LPS/SAL, and LPS/Poly I:C. At various time points, a 20G sterile catheter was inserted into the trachea to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as previously described 54 . Blood samples were immediately obtained by cardiac puncture and transferred to the laboratory for analysis of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 ), chemokines (MIP-2, MCP-1) in serum and BALF by ELISA. PMN counts in BALF were determined on Wright-Giemsa-stained slides. Briefly, total cell counts were determined on a grid hemocytometer. Then a total of 500 cells were counted in cross-section per sample, and the number of PMNs was calculated as the total cell count times the percentage in the BALF sample. The lungs were rapidly removed from all mice and washed in ice-cold saline. Half of the lung tissues were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C prior to biochemical analyses including MIP-2 expression in lung lysates was measured by Western blotting and RT-PCR, while the other half of the lung tissue was fixed in 4% formalin solution in preparation for histopathological analyses. For histological analysis, lung tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The samples were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 \u03bc m sections. After deparaffinization, the tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological analysis. Lung sections were scored for lung injury, including the following: (1) alveolar and capillary edema, (2) intravascular and peri-bronchial influx of inflammatory cells, (3) thickness of the alveolar wall, and (4) hemorrhage. The items were semiquantitatively scored as none, minimal, light, moderate, or severe (score 0, Scientific RepoRts | 7:34278 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34278 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively) by a pathologist blinded to the experimental group. The lung injury score was obtained by averaging the score from the animals within each group. AM\u03a6 isolation. BAL was performed as previously described 54 . Normally, the BAL fluid contains ~91% of AM\u03a6 and ~9% of other cells, including PMN and lymphocytes. The immunomagnetic separation system was used to isolate AM\u03a6 . Magnetic nanoparticle-conjugated antibody (CD11b MicroBeads, Miltenyi Biotec) was chosen to label and remove PMN and lymphocytes. The resulting cells consisted of > 98% macrophages, and cell viability was > 95%. AM\u03a6 from wild type, TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 , TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 and MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 \u03bc l/ml penicillin/streptomycin for 2 days, then they were washed three times with PBS and the medium was changed to low-serum medium (1% FBS). Cells were stimulated with LPS (NC, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 \u03bc g/ml) for 0-8 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml of medium.

After washing cells twice with PBS, pellet by centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g for 3 minutes and discarded the supernatant. Adding CER I (protease inhibitors and PMSF) to the cell pellet, vortex the tube vigorously for 15 s, then incubated the tube on ice for 10 minutes. Added CER II to the tube and vortex for 5 s on the highest setting, incubated the tube on ice for 1 minute. The tube was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 16,000 \u00d7 g, then transferred the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) to a clean pre-chilled tube. Nuclei pellet was suspended in NER and vortex for 15 s. Placed the sample on ice and continued vortexing for 15 s every 10 minutes, for a total of 40 minutes. After centrifuged at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes, supernatants containing nuclear proteins were frozen in liquid nitrogen in small aliquots and store at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. Protein quantification was performed using BCA protein assay.",

AM\u03a6 and lung tissues were lysated in radio-immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (RIPA), protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Protein concentrations were subsequently determined by standard BCA assay. After addition of 6 \u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer, equivalent amounts of protein were heated (100 \u00b0C; 5 min) and separated by gel electrophoresis using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. Resolved proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat milk (1 h; 24 \u00b0C). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibody against TLR3 (ab62566; Abcam, Hong Kong, China), NF-\u03ba B p65 (ab7970, Abcam, Hong Kong, China), Abcam, MIP-2 (ab25130, Hong Kong, China), PCNA (ab18197, Abcam, Hong Kong, China) and \u03b2 -actin (ab8226, Abcam, Hong Kong, China). The membranes were washed in TBST three times, incubated with secondary antibody (926-32221 IRDye 680 mouse-anti-rabbit secondary antibody; Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and then washed in TBST three additional times. The membranes were determined by using an Odyssey image analysis system (Licor Biosciences).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) in Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cycling conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. At the end of the last cycle, the temperature was increased from 65 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C (0.1 \u00b0C/s) to produce a melting curve. The specificity of amplification was assessed for each sample by melting curve analysis. Each PCR product showed a single peak. The size of the amplicon was checked by electrophoresis. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a single product of the expected size. The analysis of the expression of TLR3 relative to the \u03b2 -actin was performed with software in relative quantification mode following the manufacturer's instruction. The following criteria of sequences of all primers used in this study were applied in the course of designing the primers: product size from 100 to 500 bp, primer size from 17 to 23 bp, and a mean melting temperature of 60 \u00b0C.",
