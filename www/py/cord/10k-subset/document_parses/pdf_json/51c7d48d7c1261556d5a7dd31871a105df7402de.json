            "text": "Background: As patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) have long expected survival, the incidence of noncardiac surgery in this patient population is increasing. Here, we present the anesthetic management of a patient with a continuous-flow LVAD who underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Case presentation: A 37-year-old man with LVAD was scheduled to undergo VATS because of repeated spontaneous pneumothorax. Generally, patients with these devices have marginal right heart function; therefore, it is important to avoid factors that worsen pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). However, VATS requires one-lung ventilation (OLV) and it tends to cause increase in PVR, leading to right heart failure. In the present case, when the patient was set in a lateral decubitus position and progressive hypoxia was observed during OLV, transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle and a temporally flattened interventricular septum, and the central venous pressure increased to approximately 20 mmHg. Because we anticipated deterioration of right heart function, dobutamine and milrinone were administered and/or respirator settings were changed to decrease PVR for maintaining LVAD performance. Finally, resection of a bulla was completed, and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 37. Conclusions: The anesthetic management of a patient with LVAD during VATS is challenging because the possible hemodynamic changes induced by hypoxia associated with OLV affect LVAD performance and right heart function. In our experience, VATS that requires OLV will be well tolerated in a patient with LVAD with preserved right heart function, and a multidisciplinary approach to maintain right heart function will be needed.",

To facilitate endotracheal intubation using a left-sided double lumen tube Broncho-Cath\u2122 (Mallinckrodt Medical, Athlone, Ireland), 50 mg of rocuronium bromide was administered. We did not administer additional muscle relaxants except when a 10 mg maintenance dose of rocuronium bromide was used just after the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position, and 20 mg rocuronium bromide was administered just before the first incision. The train-of-four was measured for neuromuscular monitoring throughout the operation. A central line was inserted in the right jugular vein. The patient's ABP and central venous pressure (CVP) were continuously monitored using invasive means. Electrocardiography showed the sinus rhythm supported by the pacemaker, but the mode was changed from DDD to DOO at the heart rate of 80 bpm to avoid interference of electrocautery. Defibrillator pads were attached because implantable cardioverter defibrillator detection was inactivated. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was placed for monitoring the performance of the LVAD and to determine intraoperative cardiac function. Initial findings included severely dilated left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV), bowing of the intraventricular septum into the RV (Fig. 3) , reduced LV and RV wall motion [RV-fractional area change (FAC) 16 .8%], severe mitral regurgitation, continuous closed aortic valves, no aortic regurgitation, and trivial tricuspid regurgitation (TR) after TAP. The inflow cannula, anastomosed to the apex of the LV, and the outflow cannula, attached to the ascending aorta, of the LVAD were unobstructed with low flow velocities of 90.2 cm/s and 87.3 cm/s on pulse wave and color Doppler analyses, respectively. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was estimated at 21 mmHg by measuring the TR jet maximum velocity. First, arterial gas analysis showed the following results: pH 7.437, pCO 2 31.1 mmHg, pO 2 225 mmHg, BEecf 2.7, lactate 0.7 mmol/L, SaO 2 99% and Hb 9.2 g/dL at FiO 2 of 0.5.",

The external portion of driveline was not kinked. As the patient was coughing slightly, 10 mg rocuronium bromide was administered, and the dose of remifentanil was increased. TEE examination revealed an almost akinetic LV, free wall RV, and a flattened intraventricular septum. The inflow and outflow cannulas of the LVAD were noted to be in the proper position with a pulsatile flow of approximately 60 cm/s and 110 cm/s, respectively. We assessed that the patient needed inotropic support, and hence, the administration of dobutamine (3.3 \u03bcg/kg/min) and milrinone (0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min) was initiated. Gradually, the CVP returned to 12 mmHg, and TEE showed improved LV and RV motions, with rightward shift of the intraventricular septum. At the beginning of OLV, the pressure-controlled ventilation mode was adjusted; peak inspiratory pressure and positive endexpiratory pressure were changed from 17 cmH 2 O to 28 cmH 2 O and from 5 cmH 2 O to 7 cmH 2 O, respectively, to maintain saturation of percutaneous oxygen (SpO 2 ) above 90%. After insertion of the access ports, SpO 2 decreased to 91% at FiO 2 of 1.0, pump power consumption increased to 3.5 watts, and the CVP reached 20 mmHg, when the mean ABP was maintained at approximately 85 mmHg ( Fig. 4 (B) ). TEE showed severely reduced RV motion, and the intraventricular septum had again shifted slightly to the left side. The RVSP was calculated at 35 mmHg, whereas the RV-FAC was calculated at 17.7% and appeared to be near the pre-OLV level. For further support of right heart function, continuous intravenous infusion of milrinone was increased to 0.4 \u03bcg/kg/min. Arterial blood gas analysis at this time revealed the following results: pH 7.357, pCO2 42.9 mmHg, pO2 67.9 mmHg, BEecf \u2212 1.4, lactate 0.6 mmol/L, SaO2 96.7% and Hb 10.2 g/dL at FiO2 1.0. After a couple of min, TEE examination showed that the LV and RV motions had slightly improved, and the intraventricular septum had shifted toward the RV. Reflecting gradually improved RV wall motion, the RV-FAC was found to be 33.8%. With the increase in urine output, oxygenation improved and CVP decreased to 10 mmHg. The TEE findings did not change, and the mean ABP was maintained at 64-85 mmHg. The pulsatile waveforms were maintained on ABP and SpO 2 throughout the operation. Intraoperatively, the EVAHEART\u00ae monitor showed that the pump speed was set at 1700 rpm; the pump power consumption was 2-4 W. The VATS was completed successfully with stable hemodynamic conditions. Intraoperatively, the total administration of fentanyl was 450 \u03bcg. For postoperative pain control, a single intercostal nerve block (ICNB) was applied by the thoracic surgeons from the inside whilst closing the chest, and an intravenous patient control system (fentanyl 20 \u03bcg/h, lock-out time 10 min, 20 \u03bcg/one demanded dose) was used. The total OLV time was 3 h 6 min, with an operation time of 3 h 5 min, necessitating a fluid input of 1320 ml crystalloids. The total urine output and blood loss measured were 2550 ml and 23 ml, respectively. Before recovery from general anesthesia, the TEE findings and LVAD parameters showed unremarkable changes in the supine position. The neuromuscular blockade was reversed with sugammadex sodium. After extubation, the patient did not experience pain and could breathe deeply. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable condition. However, he needed temporary bilevel positive airway pressure support after several hours. Moreover, postoperative pneumonia was suspected on postoperative day 2, and a change in the antibiotic protocol was needed. Finally, he recovered in 1 week and was discharged from our hospital in stable condition on postoperative day 37. ",

When the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, CVP increased from 12 mmHg to 20 mmHg (A). After insertion of the access ports, SpO2 decreased to 91% at FiO2 of 1.0, and the CVP reached 20 mmHg, although the mean ABP was maintained at approximately 85 mmHg (B). ABP: arterial blood pressure, CVP: central venous pressure, SpO2: saturation of percutaneous oxygen, FiO2: fraction of inspiratory oxygen, OLV: one-lung ventilation.

In addition, TEE was anticipated to replace PAC because TEE can provide quantification of pulmonary artery systolic pressure by the trans-tricuspid pressure gradient, which is a reliable method compared to PAC [15] . Practically, in conjunction with CVP, TEE was useful to assess the deteriorative hemodynamic changes following OLV and change in patient position and to guide fluid therapy and inotropic drug administration.

Because the patient was diagnosed with Becker type muscular dystrophy, we chose total intravenous anesthesia to avoid the potential risk of malignant hyperthermia, although controversial results have been reported regarding whether malignant hyperthermia is caused by administration of succinylcholine rather than volatile anesthetic agents [31, 32] . We believe that it is not crucial to select the type of anesthesia in LVAD patients that require OLV.",
