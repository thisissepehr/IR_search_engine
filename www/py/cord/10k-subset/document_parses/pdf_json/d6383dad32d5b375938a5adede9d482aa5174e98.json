In addition, NMBAs are also reported to directly alleviate pulmonary and systemic inflammatory progression [13] . In the updated guideline for ARDS management, NMBAs are recommended for a subgroup of moderate-to-severe ARDS patients for early use in 48 to 72 h [14] .

However, in a recently published large-scale randomized trial in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, the early use of NMBAs in the first 48 h unexpectedly revealed no significant difference in mortality compared with usual care [21] , which made NMBA use in ARDS further undetermined. Thus, it requires us for a quantitative analysis of the pooled results of up-to-date trials of NMBA use to validate the current effects of NMBAs in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Furthermore, as the results between trials were inconsistent, we thought it might be necessary to investigate the reasons leading to the discrepancies in results for future study design and selection of patients that would potentially benefit from NMBA use in clinical practice.",

Reverse triggering was paradoxically seen in ARDS patients with deep sedation and could be resolved by NMBA use [34] . It was possible that in the trials included in the present meta-analysis, the patients in the control group with deep sedation would have reverse triggering and thus worse outcomes, and the use of NMBAs could resolve the deleterious effect of reverse triggering, while in studies in which light sedation was used in the control group, reverse triggering was mitigated, which might have masked the effects of NMBA use [35, 36] .",

However, we did not regard the definition for ARDS as a confounding factor and we would rather believe this could probably due to the evolvement of ARDS management, which seemed to make NMBA use less important. NMBA was not a \"magic bullet\" and should be a part of a lung-protective strategy.",

More trials are needed to further validate the effects of NMBAs in ARDS. We used a mathematical imputation method to calculate the variables with the after-before alterations of certain parameters, which would potentially bring bias to the results and the interpretations. Some of the subgroup analyses included only two studies, which could potentially bring bias to the results and should be interpreted cautiously.",

Sensitivity analysis.Additional file 7. Publication bias by funnel plot.Additional file 8. Univariate meta-regression analysis. Following factors were used for meta-regression, publishing year, sample size, language (English or Chinese), ARDS definition (AECC or Berlin criteria), estimated average PaO2 to FiO2 ratio of ARDS patients at enrollment, estimated average improvement of PaO2 to FiO2 ratio 24 hours after enrollment, quality of the study, percentage of patients with intra-pulmonary etiology, sedation strategy (light or deep).Additional file 9. Sub-group analysis. Patients were divided by ARDS definition (AECC or Berlin), initial PEEP setting (<= 10 mmHg vs > 10mmHg), PaO2 to FiO2 ratio at enrollment (<= 150mmHg vs > 150mmHg) and sedation strategy (light vs deep sedation). Authors' contributions WC carried out the analysis and interpretation of data and participated in drafting, editing, and submitting the manuscript. The articles were reviewed by two reviewers (WC and QS) independently in accordance with the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus and discussion including a third reviewer (FP). The quality of the articles was assessed by WC and JX independently, with disagreements resolved by consulting a third reviewer (QS).
