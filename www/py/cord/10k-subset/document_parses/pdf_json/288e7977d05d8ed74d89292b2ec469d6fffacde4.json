            "text": "Recently, we have demonstrated the feasibility of imaging myocardial uptake of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with SPECT. The aim of the present study was to determine whether FDG SPECT could predict reversibility of regional wall motion (RWM) abnormalities in patients undergoing revascularization. We studied 15 patients prior to revaseularization (9 CABG and 6 PTCA); all had RWM abnormalities as assessed with 2D echo. Each patient underwent resting thallium-201 SPECT (to evaluate regional perfusion), and a FDG SPECT during a hyperinsulinemie glucose clamp. After revascularization 2D echo was repeated to study change in RWMA (15 segment analysis). The segmental wall motion was analyzed using a 0-3 score index (0=normo, l=hypo, 2=akinesia and 3=dyskinesia). For comparison of SPECT imaging with 2D echo, the my'ocardium was divided in 5 corresponding segments (apex, anterior, lateral, inferior and septal). The SPECT images were analyzed using PET criteria for viable tissue (hypoperfusion with relatively enhanced FDG uptake) and necrotic tissue (both decreased perfusion and FDG uptake). We identified 13 viable and 18 necrotic segments. In 10 viable segments RVgM recovered, and in 16 necrotic segments no change in RWM abnormalities was seen. RWM score decreased in viable segments after revascularization from 2,8+1.7 to 1.2__+1.2 (p<0.005). In the necrotic segments the RWM score remained unchanged: 3.3_.+2.1 vs 3.3+1.8 (p=NS). The sensitivity of FDG SPECT imaging to detect improvement in RWM abnormalities was 83% and the specificity was 84%. These data suggest that FDG SPECT can identify viable myocardium. 200 patients (pts) underwent assessment of myocardial viability by combined nuclear imaging using resting SPECT with Tc-99m MIBI for evaluation of myocardial perfusion and metabolic imaging by PET and F-18 FDG. During a 17+7 month follow-up 1081200 pts (53%) underwent coronary revascularization either by PTCA (46 pts) or CABG (62 pts) while 90 pts were treated medically and 2 pts underwent cardiac transplantation. 72/108 pts had follow-up angiography 6-+1 months after revascularization (35 pts with 3-+1 CABG, 37 pts with single-vessel PTCA). Results of regional wall motion (RWM) comparison (RWMl=baseline, using the centerline method are expressed in SD of a normal population with negative values indicating hypokinesis. RWM comparison in regions with reduced peffusion (regional MIBI uptake below -2SD of a normal population) is given for three groups categorized by preoperative viability imaging: A: FDG >70% of normal perfused region (viable with \"mismatch\"), B: FDG 51-70% Cintermediate\"), and C: FDG <50% (\"scar\").",

Thus, functional outcome of RWM was similar following either PTCA or CABG for the tissue subgroups. However, recovery of RWM in \"mismatch\" regions and of global function was slightly better after CABG which might indicate more severe preoperative ischemia or the effect of complete revascularization in patients with multivessel disease. Maintained glucose metabolism assessed by FDG and PET indicates preserved viability of hypoperfused and dysfunctional myocardium. To evaluate the regional relationship between the severity of MIBI perfusion defects and FDG uptake, resting MIBI SPECT studies of 174 patients (85% male, 58_+9 years, 84% with previous myocardial infarction) were compared with data acquired by PET and FDG. MIBI and FDG uptake was evaluated by a computerized semiquantitative analysis for 13 left ventricular regions. The region of maximal MIBI uptake was set as 100% for both data sets and regional uptake of both tracers was normalized to this reference region. FDG uptake >70% was defined as lower threshold of preserved viability (v) and FDG uptake <50% was categorized as definite evidence for scar (s) tisssue.

Myocardial blood flow (MBF) estimates with PET and O-15 water or N-13 ammonia have been shown to distinguish viable from nonviable myocardium. To evaluate whether other model parameters, such as the recovery coefficient in the water model and K1/K2 from the ammonia model, may provide additional information, 14 coronary patients (pts) with anterior wall dysfunction underwent PET with O-15 water and N-13 ammonia before revaseularization. In addition to MBF, (x, the recovery coefficient from the 1-compartment water model, and K2, the backward transport rate constant from the 3-compartment ammonia model, were computed. Because overestimation of MBF has been noted in infarcted segments with 0-15 water and the standard 3-parameter model (WA 1) where recovery is a fitted parameter, MBF was also determined from a water model with a priori knowledge of finite resolution effects (WA 2).

            "text": "One of the main problems in patients with lymphomas after first line treatment is the diagnosis of residual viable tumor tissue for further treatment planning. We used PET in patients with recurrent Hogkin's (HL) and Non-Hodgkin's (NHL) disease to quantify the tumor perfusion and metabolism prior and after second line chemotherapy. The primary aim of the study was the detection and quantification of residual tumor metabolism during restaging in order to optimize the further chemotherapeutic treatment protocol. Furthermore, followup studies with PET were used to evaluate the effect of the treatment protocol. SPECT with Tc-99m-Sestamibi was used for the evaluation of multi drug resistance (MDR). The PET results were compared to morphologlc (CT) and clinical data. The preliminary evaluation includes 32 (HL, 15 patients) and 33 (NHL, 17 patients) lesions. FDG (130-350 MBq) is injected for tumor metabolism studies, while O-15 labeled water {2088-2811 MBq) is administered to assess the tumor perfusion. SPECT studies were performed 30 min after intravenous injection of 370-555 MBq Tc-99m-Sestamibi for the evaluation of MDR. The quantitative evaluation of the iteratively reconstructed PET data was performed using a ROI-technique. SUV were calculated from the ROI data. The perfusion values ranged from 1.63 to 3.31 SUV in all lesions, while significantly lower values were calculated for the normal soft tissue (0.64 SUV, mean value). The metabolism was increased in the malignant lesions and with a large range between 1.42-and 13.35 SUV. The FDG uptake in normal soft tissue and scar tissue was 0.6647).90 SUV. No significant correlation was noted for tumor perfusion and metabolism. Furthermore, no significant differences were found for HL and NHL We were able to compare the FDG uptake prior and after one chemotherapeutic cylce (dexamethasone, BCNU, etoposide, alexane, melphalan for HL; alexane, mitoxantrone for NHL). While the tumor metabolism was significantly lower after therapy in 5 of 9 lesions, no change was noted in 3 tumors. A decrease in tumor metabolism and no change in morphology (CT) was noted in three lesions responding to therapy. The accumulation of Tc-99m-Sestamibi and the FDG metabolism prior and after therapy was compared in 10 patients. Again. the change in FDG metabolism correlated with the restaging data. The uptake of TC-99m-Sestamibi was predictive for MDR. Progression of disease was observed in four patients without Sestamibi accumulation, while response to chemotherapy or stab]e disease was associated with Sestamibi uptake (n=4). Our results show, that PET studies with FDG are a promising tool for both diagnostic evaluation during restaging and therapy planning in HL and NHL patients. The SPECT studies with Tc-99m-Sestamibi may help to detect MDR, when the size and location of the lesion permit a qualitative evaluation. Energy metabolism Of hematopoetic bone marrow (BM) is mainly based on glucose utilization. Aim of the present study was to evaluate FDG-PET for characterization of BM metabolism of cancer patients (n=26). Static PET was performed 46+18 minutes after i.v. injection of 224__+68 MBq FDG. Differential uptake ratios (DUR) for bone marrow of the thoracic or lumbar spine were determined using the ROI technique (21 + 12 ROI/scan; coronal and sagittal slices). BM diagnosis (normal, normal after chemotherapy [0-90 d], malignant infiltration, stimulation before planned autologues BM transplantation, irradiated BM) was established by histology, CT/MRI and/or clinical followup. Compared to normal (DUR: 1.93+0.43; n=13), increased FDGuptake was observed in patients with malignant BM infiltration (DUR: 3.41 +0.43; n=4) and-after external BM-stimulation (DUR: 3.86; n = 1), however, not during physiological BM-regeneration (DUR: 1.94+0.55; n=6). Radiotherapy caused a marked decrease of FDG-uptake (DUR: 1.19; n=2). We conclude that FDG-PET is suitable for characterizing hematopoetic bone marrow metabolism. It might be useful to improve noninvasive treatment control in patients with neoplastic bone marrow involvement. The diagnostic performance of IBZM-SPECT for discriminating idiopathic from other parkinsonian Syndromes is acceptable (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 77%). Optimal thresholds varied in the different entities, Discrimination capacity Was evidently s u~o r for using S/FCratios compared to S/OC-ratiOs, thus supporting the FC as reference. De novo patients may be classified more accurately than those pretreated with doparninergic drugs prior to the SPECT study.",

Previous studies have s h o~ that NCQ-298, a salicylamide ((S)-3iodo-N-[( 1 -ethyl-2-pyrr olinidyl)met hyl]-5,6-dimethox3'salicylamide labelled with 1-125 and 1-123, possesses the prerequisite pharmacological properties to be used in vivo for the visualisation of dopamine D2 receptors (-Hall et al, 1991, Psychopharmacology, 103:6-18). In SPECT studies in baboons, 1 h aRer injection of 1-123 NCQ-298 the radioactive concentration in the striatum reached a plateau that remained constant for 4 h. The striatum to cerebellum radioactivity concentration ratio values: S/C (uncorrected for partial volume effects) were 10 and 21 at 1 h and 4 h, respectively. In humans, brain SPECT studies were performed with a double head DST Sophy y-camera equipped with ultra high resolution parallel hole collimators, after i.v. administration of 150 MBq of 1-123 NCQ-298. Sequential acquisitions of 64 images in 128* 128 (pixel=3.4 mm) were obtained over 360 \u00b0 with the smallest circular orbit. Tomographio images were reconstructed by filtered hack projection with resolution recovery Butterworth apodisation. The observation of the radioactivity distribution in the brain showed an accumulation of the radioactivity in the basal ganglia as soon as 0.5 h after injection with a maximum at 3-4 h; on the contrary the radioactivity in the others structures cleared continuouly from an early maximum (10 rain). 6 h post injection, the S/C ratio value reached 40. These results suggest that I-123 NCQ-298 has the potentiai of being used tbr clinical SPECT investigations of cerebral D-2 receptors in the human brain. Serotonin (5HT) uptake inhibitors are substances which are widely used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric syndromes such as obsessive compulsive disorders.It aiso has been hypothesized that changes of 5HT uptake sites (US) in the brain are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Up till now it has not been possible to measure 5HT-US in the brain in humans in vivo. The cocaine anaiog 2-l~-carbomethoxy-3-8-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane (13-CIT) is a ligand for both DA-and 5HT-US which in its [I-123] labeled form can be used for SPECT.SPECT-experiments in primates have shown that I~-CIT binds to 5HT-US in the brain stem and to DA-US in the striatum. The purpose of the present study was to compare [123I]-1~-CIT binding in the brain stem (pens, midbrain and hypothaiamus) of normal controls and patients under treatment with citalopram. After informed consent 12 depressive patients under 20mg (n=6) or 40mg (n=6) Citaiopram daily and 10 normal Controls were studied 2, 4. 16, 20 and 24 hours after i.v. injection of 111 to 148 MBq using a triple head gamma camera (Siemens Multispect). After reconstruction and attenuation correction ROIs were drawn in axial slices in the brain stem, stdatum and cerebellum using a brain atlas.Cpm's per pixel were caiculated, decay corrected to the time of injection, and corrected for body weight and injected dose. Specific binding was defined as target minus cerebellum. Results show a highly significant reduction of 13-CIT binding in the brain stem in patients under citalopram compared to controls (41 + 13 vs 83 _+ 48 cpm's, 4 hrs pSnj., p < 0.0001) which was dosedependent. No changes were found in the striatum. To our knowledge this is the first report directly demonstrating the effect of a selective 5HT uptake inhibitor in the brain in humans in vivo. SPECT measurements of 5HT uptake sites in patients with depression and other psychiatric disorders might provide better insights into the pathophysiology of these disorders and into mechanisms of drug action.",

Uptake in the thalamus, amygdala, substantia nigra, colliculus and neocortex was 2-5 times higher than in the cerebellum. In extrastriatal brain regions radioactivity reached a plateau at about 50 nfinutes after injection. Assuming that radioactivity in the cerebellum reflects the level of free and non-specific binding, the specific binding in extrastriatal regions was on a maximal level within 60 minutes. Human post-mortem whole hemisphere autoradiography using [I-125] epidepride demonstrated labelled receptors in nucleus candatus, putamen and pallidum and also in extrastriatal areas such as thalamus and the substantia nigra. Specific [C-11] FLB 457 binding should be appropriate for a quantitative equilibrium analysis of extrastriatal dopamine receptor densities with PET. With highresolution SPECT cameras it should be possible to visualize extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptors using [I-123]epidepride. We have d e v e l o p e d SSTR-binding peptides (>50) which can be l a b e l e d with Tc-99m to very high specific activity (300 Ci/mMol). The tumor uptake-kinetics of these Tcpeptides were compared with In-Oct in rats bearing Longnecker tumors (pancreatic tumor line CA20948).

Groups 1 and 3 were ventilated using Tc-99m Technegas, groups 2 and 4 were ventilated using Tc-99m DTPA aerosol. For each scan the age of the patient, the presence or absence of aerosol clumping, the number of ventilation defects (no defects, one or two defects or > 2 defects) and the final clinical report (obtained using the Biello criteria) was noted. No significant differences were found between groups 1 and 3 or groups 2 and 4 therefore these results were pooled to give two groups of 96 patients, one for Teehnegas and one for DTPA aerosol. All comparisons of the two ventilation agents were performed using the Pearson chi-squared test. The mean age of the patients was 56 years and there was no significant difference in the distribution of ages in the two groups (p>0.05). There was a significant difference (p<0.001) in the number of scans with aerosol clumping present, with 19% of the Technegas scans compared to 41% of the DTPA scans showing this feature.

Twenty-one patients with histologically proven SCLC were examined : 17 at tumor presentation, 4 had previous therapy.Patients were staged on the basis of chest X-ray, serum neuroenolase (NSE) determination, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bone scintigraphy, abdominal US, chest and brain CT scan. In few patients planar scintigraphy was performed, 1,5, and 24 hours after i v injection of 110 MBq of 11 lIn-Octreoscan.The 11 lIn-Octreotide tumor uptake registered at 5 hours from the injection was good and the imaging was comparable to that of late scan; for this reason the standard examination was manteined at 5 hours. Scanning was done with a Toshiba GCA 901/A gamma camera equipped with a medium energy collimator. SPECT of the thorax and of particular regions of interest was performed. In 20 out of 21 patients lung tumors were visualized at 5 hours scan. The negative case had undergone to a previous chemotherapy. The last scan, when performed, confirmed in all patients the positivity or the negativity of the imaging obtained with the early scan. Octreotide uptake was in generally more extensive than expected from RX and CT studies. The somatostatine analogue visualized all the lesions were demostrated by means of other instrumental examination with the exception of 2 liver metastatic sites, 2 lymph-nodal metastases, 1 adrenal metastases detected by US and/or CT scans; on the contrary l llIn-Octreotide scintigraphy revealed 5 unknown distant lesions (3 lymph-nodes, 1 bone, 1 brain) previously not identified with standard examinations.

After a i0 min transmission scan a dynamic sequence was performed and an average image (14-45 min) produced and recalculated to provide images of standardized uptake values (SUV). Regions of interest were drawn by a standardized procedure. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) was carried out in 17 patients on a Siemens Somatom Plus CT-scanner using 4 mm contiguous slices. In 18 patients ultra sonography (US) was performed (Acuson 128, 5 9~z). Results; Sugery revealed enlarged parathyroid tissue in 20 patients but not in 1 patient. PET was true positive in 76%, false positive in 19% and true negative in 5% of the patients. CT was true positive in 65% and US in 50%. The results suggest tht PET may provide novel possibilities for preoperative parathyroid imaging in HPT. In this study, an attempt was made to administer Xe-t33 by ventilation into the tympanic cavity in order to quantitate uptake and clearance of the tracer as a measure of Eustachian tube function. 50 MBq of Xenon-133 gas filled in a 50 rrd syringe were administered to 15 ENT patients testing 3 different approaches. In 2 patients the gas was injected directly into the tympanic cavity via an in-place Armstrong tube. In another 5 patients Xe-133 was insuffiated into the epipharynx using a nasopharyngeal catheter. Subsequently the patients ~vere asked to perform Valsalva manoeuvres three times to imitate physiological ventilation of the middle ear. In a third group of 8 patients Xe-133 was administered via a nose olive while having Vatsalva manoeuvres done simultaneously, Immediately after gas application sequential gamma camera imaging for 30 rain and semiquantitative evaluation by ROI-techniques were performed. As a main result of this study it is to state that all three approaches were successful in trapping Xe-t33 within the middle ear space without major problems. Initial accumulation of Xe-133 in the tympanic cavity during the first two minutes yielded a right to left ratio of 51.1 +_ 10,2 % to 48.9 _+ 10.2 % in 10 patients with normal Eustachian tube function. The clearance half life ranged from 11.5 rain to 217.9 rain with a median of 96.2 min. One-sided malfunction of the Eustachian tube proven by impedance mesurements or even the beneficial effects of one-sided application of decongestive drugs could nicely be quanfitated both by initial trapping as well as by clearance half life, respectively. In conclusion, tympanon Xe-133 ventilation scintigraphy is an easyto-perform and low-radiation-exposure test for evaluating the middle ear ventilation and, thus, Eustachian tube function. Normal ranges are provided by this study, yet the clinical impact needs to be documented by especially designed ENT trials. Recent papers have demonstrated the usefullness of Tc MIBI scintigraphy (MS) and its potential superiority over thallium-201 for the diagnosis of parathyroid (PT) enlargement. In order to determine where would be the place of this new imaging procedure in the decision tree before surgery, we performed MS in I00 patients (pts) with suspected hyp. erparathyroidism (HPT). All I00 pts had both echographic and scintigraphic examinations. MS was performed using a double phase method, i.e. imaging time post injection was 15 mn and then 75 ran. Up to now, only 58 of these I00 pts, had unde~one surgical exploration. Based on the histologic control of these cases, we have established three major indications of MS in identifying PT adenomas. MS is superior to all other techniques for the diagnosis and localization of ectopic glands (6 pts in our group). MS is determinant in all cases of recurrent or persistent HPT. When concordance is found between echography and MS on a single site, local instead of general anaesthesia c~tn be proposed. The recent increasing demand for HPT exploration, coupled with the cardiac use of MIBI, allowed a dramatic reduction of the cost per patient, falling below that of thallium. We conclude that MS is a powerful tool for the strategy of localizing PT adenomas, especially when ectopic situation is suspected, and should be therefore performed in all patients with clinical and biological hype rparathyro ~' dism.",

Eleven neonates were investigated; follow-up studies were performed in 4 cases [from 10 to 24 days of age, med: 20 days ]. They were all full-term, matnre babies, but they all had perinatal asphyxia and/or neurological symptoms such as convulsions, marked hypetonia or rigidity.

In first month the cortical rCBF was found to be lower than the rCBF in adults, mainly in the frontal and parietal regions. There was a strikingly higher cerebellar and brain stem uptake. In the first four months the activity of the cortical regions continued to increase, the only exception being the frontal area. After the sixth month the rate of this frontal hypoperfusion showed a futher decrease. By the end of first year, no climcal signs of neurological defects were detected and all these babies were normaly developed. During brain SPECT exmninati0ns of neonates, consideration must be paid to these changes in rCBF, which always depend on the state of maturation of the brain.",

To evaluate the role of nuclear medicine procedures in this special group of children regarding primary diagnosis and evaluation of therapy was the purpose of this investigation using routine thallium imaging combined with receptor avid substances like somatostatin analogue octreotide R. Patients and methods: 13 children (age 1-21, mean 8.9 (age 21: recurrency from childhood tumour)) were imaged with Thallium-201 and Somatostatin-receptor ligand 1n-111 Octreotide R (Mallinckroctt, FRG). After having obtained informed consent from the parents according to the rules of the ethical comittee, SPECT imaging was performed 30 minutes after injection (for TI-201) or 3h p.i. (Octreotide) followed by 24h SPECT in some cases. In case of two tracers applied, a dual isotope SPECT was done. Turnout/to non-tumour uptake was calculated from ROIs over the turnout and normal brain tissue in the same slice. TI was done in 11, octreotide in 9, repeat imaging for therapy follow-up in 3 (1-3 controls). Histology was mainly obtained by surgery and ranged from Pineocytoma, astrocytoma II, 11t to dysgerminoma and medulloblastoma. Differentiation according to WHO grading was 1: 3, I1: 2, II1: 3, IV: 5. Results: Uptake values in therapy controls demonstrated tumour response to chemotherapy, in one case of a pinealoblastoma encouraging further successful low dose therapy. Mean TI uptake values (according to grading): I: 1.99; I1: 3.34; Ilk 4.86; IV: 3.08, octreotide uptake: Ilk 4.08; IV: 6.75. Conclusions: The use of different tracers in primary childhood brain tumours is of importance to define the best tracer for further therapy control. TI and octreotide uptake values do not seem to be able to differentiate low and high malign tumors. The high uptake of somatostatin analogue in vivo in highly malignant tumours contradicts previous in vitro results. ",

Diagnosis was made by complex invasive bronchologic examinations. 24 children had bronchlectasia, 14 had deformed bronchial tree (9 with lobar and 5 with segmental deformation), 7 had other types of morphologic abnormallties. Multiple views ventilation scintigraphy was performed. 20-40 MBqs of Tc-99m-DTPA aerosol was inhaled within 2-3 minutes. Procedure was well tolerated by children even with acute respiratory symptoms. Good-quality images were taken in all of the 67 scintigraphic studies. Grade and localization of the reglonal ventilation abnormalit[ is essential for adequate therapy (bronchoscoplc or surgical intervention or conservative treatment) in this patient group. Ventilation scintigraphy using an effective aerosol producing equipment proved to be useful in the follow-up of patients, because improvement or deterioration of regional ventilation contributes to making therapeutic decision in patients with morphoanatomic abnormalities of the bronchial system and invasive techniques may be avoided.

            "text": "Multiple oesophageal malfunctions were seen in i5 patients. In conclusion scintigraphic PA is a relatively rare event, even in patients with repeated respiratory infections. It usually coexists with other foregut malfunctions, In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction resting technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) imaging may underestimate the presence o f viable myocardium. Rest-redistribution (RR) thallium scintigraphy is able to identify hypoperfused hibernated myocardium. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of MIBI imaging after nitrate administration in differentiating severely ischemic but viable myocardium from fibrotic tissue. Thirty patients (28 teen, ree~.,~ age 56_+10 yrs) with angiographically proven CAD and LV dysfunction (ejection fraction 45-+t4%) underwent resting and nitrate (nitroglycerine 0.005 mg/kg per os) MIBI (20 mCi iv) tomography in two separate days and RR thallitcm-201 (3 mCi iv) tomography within one ~eek. A total of 660 segments were quantitatively analyzed. On resting MIBI imaging, 292 segments were normal (uptake >75%), 180 segreents showed moderate reduction (51-74%) and 188 severe reduction ~50%) of tracer uptake. Of these 188 segments with severe reduction of resting MIBI uptake, 47 (25%) showed increased M1BI uptake (~.I0% vs resting study) after nitroglycerine administration (from 43+7% to 60i-8%, p<0.001). All these 47 segments were identified as viable on RR thallium (2 normals, 26 reversible defects, and 19 mild-moderate irreversible defects). Of the 141 (75%) segments with severe reduction of resting MIBI uptake and no change after nitroglycerine administration, the reajority (i00 segments) were identified as nonviable on RR thallium (severe irreversible defects); however, the remaining 41 segments showed evidence of viable myocardium on RR thallium (18 reversible defects and 23 mildmoderate irreversible defects). In conclusion, nitrate administration improves the differentiation between severely ischemic but still viable myocardiure from irreversibly fibrotic tissue using MIBI cardiac toreography in patients with chronic ischemic LV dysfunction. Beta-methyl iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) allows for myocardial metabolic studies with SPECT. BMIPP uptake reflects the activity of acyl-CoA synthetase, a common enzyme in triglyceride synthesis and beta-oxydation. More reduced BMIPP uptake than flow tracer uptake (mismatching) may be observed in postischemic dysfunctioning myocardium early after acute myocardial infarction (AM/).",

In 13 regions with persistent 201Tl-d~2f~cts hibemating/s99tg~mwed myocardium could be identified as well with I-PHIPA as with Tc-Sestamibi. In 4 lesions no loerfusion with 99mTc-Sestamibi was observed, but a significant uptake of I23i.li.PHiPA implicated residual viable myoeardium. This could be confirmed by follow-up studies after revascularization where the perfusion with 99mTc-Sestamibi was improved. During a heart transplantation a double nuclide study using 131I-PHIPA and 99mTc-Sestamibi was performed. Scintigraphies of the explanted heart were compared to the preoperative scans, the activity of tissue samples and the corresponding histology. 131I-PHIPA and 99mTe-Sestamibi were accumulated in hibernating or stunned myocardium in a ratio of 2 : 1 according to their percent I.D. In scares however, the accumulation ratio of PHIPA / Sestamibi reversed to 1 : 2. These results imply that residual viable myocardium can be more accurately differentiated from scares with PHIPA 3-10 than with Sestamibi. Furthermore the different biodistribution of PHIPA and Sestamibi in hibernating myocardium and scares indicates that not only the perfusion, but the metabolic state of the myocardium can be evaluated with PHIPA 3-10. As a metabolic marker of the heart PHIPA 3-10 has the potential to improve the assessment of myocardial viability with SPECT. To assess whether rest Tc-99m Sestamibi (Mibi) could identify viable myocardium, we studied 15 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease (three-vessel disease in 9 and two-vessel disease in 6) and left ventrlcular dysfunction (ejection fraction: 30-J:11%), referred to positron emission tomography (PET) for identification of viable myocardium. A combined study of perfusion ( potassium-38 or N-13 ammonia) and glucose utilization (18-FDG) was performed under hyperunsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp. For each study, potassium-38 or N-13 ammonia and 18-FDG activities were determined in 19 myocardial segments. The segment with the highest potassium-38 or N-13 ammonia uptake was set as 100% for both data sets and segment uptake was normalized to this reference segment, Based on results obtained in control subjects, the thresholds for segment viability were defined as perfusion tracer uptake <70% and FDG uptake >70% of the reference segment. For each patient, Mibi activity (expressed as percent of peak activity) was determined in the19 segments by circumferential profile analysis. Comparison between PET and Mibi data was realized in a total number of 212 segments. According to PET criteria, 43 segments (20%) were non viable and 61 segments (29%) were viable. Mibi uptake was 50+17% and 59~-_17% in non viable and viable segments, respectively (p=0.01).",

Spheroids of a human adenocarcinoma cell line (SW 707) were incubated in media containlng C-14-FDG or H-3-thymidine (37 kBq/ml) for lh at 1,4,8,24 and 48h after irradiation with 6 Gy. Tracer uptake was measured per spheroid. The number of viable cells was determined using the mitochondrial enzyme activity (MTT-test) and the proliferative capacity of dispersed spheroid cells by the clonogenic survival assay. The uptake changed in the following manner (uptake of control = 100%),%__ The proliferative capacity decreased to 4% of control az lh recoverlng to 21% at 48h. The results indicate, that tracer uptake is changing with time and is higher for the viable cells than for the whole spheroid. The difference is depending on the number of survivlng cells. The high uptake at 8h is an indication for the recovery of the proliferative capacity. Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). This disease can be modeled in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice inoculated with the HTLV-t-infected leukemic cell line 43T. The purpose of this study was to examine the early and late distributions of these cells in vivo using In-111-oxine labeled 43T cells and radiolabeled anti-Tac (IL-2 receptor c, chain) monoclonal antibody (MAb), respectively, Early phase distribution was examined 2 and 6 days after the i.p. injection of 108 In-111-oxine-43T cells into SCID and normal mice. By day 6 significant accumulations of radioactivity were found in the spleen and thymus of SCID mice (33.3_+9.4 and 10.0~-_3.6 %lDtg, respectively) in comparison with normal mice (19.1.+.2.5 and 3.7_+0.9 %lDtg). The accumulations in other organs of SCID mice were not significantly higher than in those of normal mice. Late phase distribution was monitored in 43T-inoculated-SCID mice starting 28 days after i.p. injection of the cells (not labeled with In-111-oxine) by localization with I-t25 and In-111 labeled anti-Tac MAb (IgG2a) and an isotypematched control MAb. The 6iodistributions were examined 1, 2 and 4 days after i.v. injection of MAb. Significant amouts of In-111-anti-Tac MAb were found in the spleen and thymus of SCID mice (22~5\u00b16.9 and 22.8_+6.9 %lDtg, respectively at day 2), whitzh were higher than those in the same organs of mice given In-Ill-control MAb (12.0\u00b15.1 and 7.5=b4.6 %lD/g). Similar results were obtained with 1-125 labeled anti-Tac and control MAbs. These results were coincident with the histologicallyconfirmed infiltration of 43T in SCID mice, suggesting that the radiometdc techniques in this study could be used to evaluate the proliferation sites of 43T cells.

From previous studies we know t h a t in vivo the cerebral uptake of flumazenil (FMZ), a benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) antagonist, is considerably increased in rats anaestetized with isoflurane. However neither the benzodiazepine receptor density (Bmax) nor the affinity (Kd) is affected by isoflurane in vitro. In an attempt to explain these observations we i n v e s t i g a t e d the interference of isoflurane on the BZR in living baboons. An in vivo modeling analysis for [llC]FMZ kinetics was used which provides an estimation of the apparent Bmax (B'max) and the equilibrium dissociation rate constant KdVR (VR = volume of reaction). Results show that the apparent Bmax and KdVR of FMZ are significantly increased by about 100 % in a n i m a l s anaesthetized with isoflurane/nitrous oxide (1%/70%) in oxygen compared to animals treated with nitrous oxide alone. We suggest t h a t B'max e n h a n c e m e n t is due to isoflurane nonspecific interaction with the lipid bilayer structm'e, altering the membrane fluidity which might result in a facilitated receptor accessiblity for FI~LZ. This increased volume of reaction may also explain the increase of KdVR in our study. These results suggest t h a t the a n a e s t h e t i c effect of inhalational anaesthetics and BZR agonists in combination results not only from an additive but from a synergistic interaction by increasing the available binding sites for benzodiazepine derivates. Acridones show biological effects on various turnouts, possibly mediated by turnout cell uptake. The aim of this study was to label selected acridone derivatives and to determine the cellular uptake in comparison to T1-201 as a known non-specific tumour tracer. Acridone (AC) and 10-methyl-acridone (MAC) were radioiodinated with 1-123 by the Iodogen method. The monoiodinated products were separated by HPLC.

The uptake was calculated as the percentage (mean + 1 cr) of the added activity and standardized to one million tmnour cells. uptake during different incubation times in breast cancer cells The uptake of 2-iodoacridone (I-123-AC) was similar to TI-201.

We conclude that patients with partial epilepsy referred for t~al-lomazenil SPECT in the detection of epileptic foci should temporarily withdraw from GVG medication. n-tAChR are possibly involved in epilepsy and may play a role in dementing processes. We address the issue of quantifying specific kinetic characteristics of these receptors in the living human brain. Dynamic and static single photon emission tomography (SPET) was quantitatively oefformed in 3 normal volunteers after intravenous injection of ~02 [-252 MBc 1 [123I]-4-iododexetimide (I-Dex), using a 4head SPET camera. The input function was determined and corrected for metaboIites using arterialized venous blood samples. Kinetic variables were extracted from the time activity curves of various braio structures using a 4-compartment model. The results (mear~+SD) are summarised in Table 1 These data support the view that after non-specific delivery to brain tissue (K1) I-Dex binds specifically (k3) to areas known to be rich in mAChR (cortex, caudate nucleus and to a lesser extent thalamus) but binds with a much lower affinity to structures with a low content of this receptor. The results validate the use of I-Dex for quantifying mAChR in the human brain in vivo. There are recent indications that GABAergic transmission may play an important role in MDD. However, little is known about the in-vivo activity of GABA receptors in depressed patients whereas many studies report about diminished cerebral blood flow and metabolism especially in the frontal lobe. Additionally, structural changes and reduced volume of the frontal lobe in patients with severe depression are described in CT or MRI studies. Thirteen patients ( 50-80 years) with a mean score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) of 26 and without evidence of relevant physical illness, history of drug abuse or other preexisting psychiatric disorders were investigated. The DSM-III-R criteria for MDD were fulfilled. Iomazenil-SPECT was performed 90 min. and HM-PAO SPECT 20 n~. al~er i.v. injection. Uptake to 8 anatomically defined ROts of the frontal lobe (4 for each side in consecutive slices, 0.Tcm thick) was normalized to the cerebellum.An uptake ratio ~ 0,9 was determined to be pathological. Neuroradiological examination was done on a 2,0-T MRI-system using T~-arid T2-weighting and disclosed slight frontal atrophy in 6 patients. They all showed a diminished blood flow in one or more ROrs. Seven patients had a normal MRI and ttM-PAO scan. G.a~A receptor activity was diminished in 12 of 13 patients in the frontal lobe. Patients with normal HMPAO and abnormal Iomazenil SPECT were characterised by a lower HRSD-score than those with abnormal pattern in both investigations (22 vs. 29, n.s.) . In course of depression, reduced GABA receptor activity precedes disturbance of regional blood flow and anatomical changes of brain structure (MRI). Exept of 2 cases of chronic and severe depression, the extend of lesions in the Iomazenil SPECT exceed those ofHM-PAO SPECT. This observation confirms the GABAergic hypothesis of depression and may be of relevance for therapeutic studies especially in the earlier stage of MDD. Muscarinic receptors may play a significant role in neurological (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy) as well as in cardiac disorders (myocardial infarction, cardiac failure). In the present study we evaluated the biodistribution of [123I]-Iododexetimide (IDEX) in three healthy volunteers as a possible radioligand for the imaging of muscarinic receptors in both the human brain and the human heart. IDEX (specific activity > 5000 Ci/mmol) was synthesized in house and showed high specificity in an animal model. Three male healthy volunteers with an average age of 32 years received approximately 185 MBq i.v.. Dynamic images of the thorax were made during the first hour after injection (lmirdframe, 64x64 matrix). Static images were acquired until 9 hours after injection (5 mirdframe, 64x64 matrix). Whole body studies were made at 5, 9 and 24 hours after injection. Liver activity increased throughout the study: 5h post injection approximately 5 % of the injected dose was measured in the liver. Lung rapidly increased after injection and diminished 1 how after ad~finistration. The myocardium proved already well defined by 15 minutes after injection. Iteart to lung ratios reached maximum values 1.5 h after injection. At 24 h post injection, 2-3% of the injected dose was still present in the liver and brain. Heart and lung activity had almost :ompletely disappeared at that time. Cardiac SPECT images with a 3headed camera (60 angles, 20sec/frame, 64x64 matrix) were obtained lh p.i. and were of high quality. Myocardial uptake of IDEX varied from 513 to 5.7 Bq/ml/MBq injected (BORSOM program v 1.0). Maximum activity in the human brain was reached at 9 h p.i., which is in accordance with literature data Brain SPECT images (Strichman SME 810, Multislice, lcm/slice, 5min/slice, 128x128 matrix), were made at 9 h p.i.. From these in vivo studies in humans, we conclude that IDEX is a promising radioligand for the imaging of muscarinic receptors in the human brain and heart. ",

One child received a second OALG because of primary non functioning first transplant. In these patients, 3 4 hepatobiliary scintigraphies (150 to 300MBq of 99mTc-Br-IDA) were performed including two phases : an angioscintigraphie phase of 60 2see-images and a functional phase of 40 lmin-images.

Quantitative evaluation of both phases permitted to assess separately the perfusion (arterio-portal index) and the function (uptake and excretion parameters) in each liver.

The mechanism of production relies on preeapilar dilation and pulmonary a/teriovenous shunts. The aim of this work is to evaluate and quantify those shunts using 99mTcAlbuminmacroaggregates scintigraphy. Twelve liver graft recipients have been studied before and 2 months post-transplantation. Each patients received 5 mei (185 MBq) of 99mTc-AMA and subsequently 5 min scans of the head, abdomen and thorax were obtained. The percentage of shunted activity (SA) was quantified as previously described: Systemic activity = (head + abdomen)/0.39. SA = Systemic Activity/(System+Lung). Normal values < 6.0% (1). Results: Before grafting, 9 patients showed a SA < 6 %, 3 of them remained within normal values at 2 months posttransplantation while 6 of them increased to abnormal values (range 7.9 -28 %), none of them showed hypoxia.In the 3 remaining patients BA was > 6 % before grafting and normalized at 2 months, only one of these 3 patients presented hypoxia. Conclusion: Those preliminary results suggest the method's high sensitivity in quantifying pulmonary shunt, even in the absence of clinical hypoxia. The changes observed posttransplantation m a y b e due to the haemodynamic changes that follow the transplant. Nevertheless further studies are in progress to clarify the reason of those changes. Addition of 3% oxygen to the argon atmosphere within the Technegas generator results in production of a modified form of Technegas, \"Pertechnegas\", which is characterised by rapid lung clearance. Use of Pertechnegas for lung clearance studies has advantages over other radioaerosols in terms of delivery efficiency, radiation safety and patient acceptability. The aim of this study was to measure and compare Pertechnegas clearance in normal volunteers and in patients with established lung disease, in particular pulmonary fibrosis.

            "text": "The fact, that inflammatory activation of granulocytes correlates with delayed transit through the pulmonary vascular bed, but not with extravascular migration argues in favour of endothelial factors in the regulation of granulocyte migration. On the other hand, an increase in PGP:TBGP is not in itself associated with alveolocapillary damage, which seems to require extravascular neutrophil migration. An increased lung clearance of Tc-99m-DTPA has been found in smokers and pts. wtih lung fibrosis and pneumocystis pneumonia. A decreased clearance has been documented for diabetic patients with vascular complications or proteinosis. Normally Tc-99m-DTPA is used for estimating an impaired epithelial integrity. Today a new imaging tracer Pertechnegas (Ptg) is available which is easy to produce and to deliver. After diffusion through the alveolar membrane it is rapidly washed out of lungs; the half time of the clearance (Tl/2) is =11 min in normal pts. After transplantation immunosuppression prevents a rejection of the organ. To evaluate the influence of long-term immunosuppressive therapy on lung permeability pts. with heart-transplants were examined. 20 non-smoking males (age: 51+10) and without any signs of rejection inhaled ==20 MBq Ptg. A dynamic study with 60 frames was acquired over a period of 15 mins and a monoexponential fitting procedure was done on the lung clearance curve. The clearance rate (Tl/2) was 13.6+_2.3 mins (range: 10.3 -19.1 ). There was a significant difference compared to a normal reference group. (n=12, T1/2=11.1+1.1 mins, range: 9 -13). The reason for that is unclear. Perhaps immunosuppression causes a thickening of the alveolar membrane. It may also be possible that the clearance is not solely dependant on diffusion but is linked to some active cellular functions which are reduced by immunosuppression, as well. The initial disease which had made transplantation necessary and the following rejection treatment must also be taken into consideration. The incidence of thyroid cancer in children from Belarus has increased after the Chernobyl reactor accident from 2-4 cases in 1986 to 66 cases in 1992. In April 1993, we started the joint Belarussian-German project \"Scientists Help Chernobyl Children\" on optimization of childhood thyroid cancer, which is sponsored by German electricity companies. From 1.4.93 to 28.2.94, 36 children with advanced thyroid cancer from Belarus have been treated with 1-131 in Essen. The 22 girls and 14 boys aged 7 -18 years (mean age 11.1 + 2.9 years); histology had shown 34 papillary and 2 follicular cancers. 31 cases had to be classified as pT4, 33 as pN1 and 25 as pM1 cancers respectively. Distant metastases were localized in the lung in 24 patients and in 1 patient in bone. Pulmonary metastases mainly were of disseminated, miliary type. Up to now 60 courses of high dose 1-131 treatment have been given to the children. Despite the fact that fractionated 1-131 treatment has not been finished, in all but one cases at least a partial response could be observed. However, in childhood thyroid cancer with disseminated lung metastases 1-131 induced pulmonary fibrosis may limit the maximum cumulative therapeutic activity of 1-131. With respect to the question of radiation carcinogenesis, biological dosimetry by micronucleus assays in peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed a higher frequency of abnormalities in cancer children as compared to a control group of children without cancer from uncontaminated areas of CIS countries.",

Prazosin related alfa 1 adrenoceptors have been known for a long time. Quinazoline derivative, doxazosin messylate (Cardura, trademark finn Pfiser) is also a competative postsynaptic alfaladrenoceptor antagonist, but with a longer half life time. Hypertensive patients were sent to our department for renography because their hypertension was supposed to be due to renal artery stenosis. Four of these patients were pretreated with antihypertensiv doxazosin. In all these cases pronounced changes in the renogrammes were found with doxazosin. In three cases the renogrammes showed reduced bilateral blood flow, prolonged peaktime and delayed excretion of the tracer (Tc99mDTPA) from the kidneys due to bilateral renal artery stenosis. In the fourth case similar results were observed in the fight kidney. The renogram of the left kidney was found to be normal. Renal angiography confnvned these results. 10 days after the removal of doxazosin new renogrammes were registered under the same conditions as with doxazosin, showing normal results.We believe that doxazosin also has some effect on the renin-angiotensin system and/or on the renalparenchyme. Renography should be avoided if the patients are taking doxazosin medication. On the other hand double renography without and with doxazosin as shown here may unmask renal artery stenosis. The incidence of deep-seated fungal infections has dramatically increased these last decades. As they are difficult to eradicate, acute and chronic renal toxicity are among the most common Side effects of a number\" of conventional antifungal treatments. Early evaluation of renal functional insufficiency in the above patients is of clinical significance. The ability of 99mTc-DTPA to detect antifungal therapy nephrotoxicity has been investigated in the present experimental work. Toxic doses (LD100, LD50 ) of amphotericin B (AMB) have been determined in mice (Swiss SWR/De). Groups of mice intravenously treated by various AMB doses inferior to LD50 are weighed daily and urine biochemistry shows normal except protein level which is increased to 30 mg/100 ml. 99mTc-DTPA biodistribution studies are performed in the above groups of mice 2 hr afte~ the injection of AMB. One hour after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical the mice are sacrificed by an ether overdose. Blood samples, and the various organs are weighed. The urine excreted and the above organs are counted in a well-type counter with reference to a standard dose. After statistical analyses the results show that in a short time interval after AMB injection the blood clearance and urinary excretion are significantly delayed as a consequence of the acute toxicity of AMB. Two hours after 3.30 mg AMB/kg b.wt, the 99mTc-DTPA concentration in blood 1 hr after inj. is equal to 18.12+4.63% of injected dose compared to 1.86_+0.23% in controls, whereas excretion in urine is equal to 33.20_+6.18% of injected dose comeared to 90.81\u00b13.54% in controls. The extent of disturbances in 99mTc-DTPA pharmacokinetics is related to AMB dose. In conclusion, the above results suggest that 99mTc-DTPA can be efficiently used in order to evaluate the degree of renal impairment induced by high doses of antifungal agents and to help in the follow-up of the above patients. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of positron emission tomography with 18-F-FDG (FDG-PET) in the detection of pelvic lymphnode metastases of urogenital malignomas compared to x -r a y computed tomography (CT). 30 patients were studied; 20 patients presented with prostate cancer, 7 patients with bladder cancer and 3 patients with penile cancer. FDG-PET was performed in fasting state after bolus injection of 370 MBq 18-F-FDG with a PC 4096 PET-Scanner, Patients were scanned dynamically in one scanner position until 80 min poet injection, Additional static frames were aquired to cover the entire pelvic region. All patients recieved a pelvic or inguinal lymphnode dissection. Postsurgical histological examination revealed lymphnode metastases in 12 / 30 patients; two of the 12 patients affected had micrometastases (<]mm) only, PET detected focal lesions of high FDG-uptake in 10 patients, whereas CT detected suspicious lymph nodes in only 5 patients, Both FDG-PET and CT failed to detect metastatic desease in the two patients with micrometastases, FDG-PET detected lymphnode metastases in sigqaiflcantly more patients (ca, 80%) with metastatic desease than CT (ca. 45%) did, The data suggests that FDG-PET detects pelvic lymphnode m e t a s t a s e s of urogenital malignomas with a higber sensitivity than x -r a y computed tomography. Previous preliminary report has shown a neurotoxic effect of doxorubicin on the myocardium assessed by I123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy.To further evaluate this doxorubicin-induced cardiac neurotoxicity we analyzed data from 36 patients (pts, 26 women, 13 men, mean age 53-+16 with various malignant diseases; 13 pts were receiving doxorubicin with a mean.cumulative dose 353~168 mg/m 2 while 23 pts were not on doxorubicin. Cardiac I123-MIBG uptake was assessed as heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M) obtained 4 hours after intravenous injection of 5mCi I123-MIBG. Ejection fraction (EF) by radionuclide ventriculography was 57%-+10% in pts on doxorubicin and 60%~6% in pts withOJt doxorubicin (ns). In control pts MIBG H/.M was 2,13\u00b10,2 while in doxo.rubicin pts 1,76-+0,2 (p<O,O01). Taking as a cutoff point (mean-2SD} the H/M 1,73, none of the pts without doxorubicin had H/M belo.w 1,73 while 4/13 pts on doxorubicin had H/M <1,73 (p<O,O1).In 10 pts MIBG scintigraphy was repeated after receiving 236_+46 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin. I n i t i a l H/M was 2,24-+0,2 and fell to 1,97-+0,29 (p<O,05); H/M became abnormal (<i~73) in 3/10 pts; EF changed from 60%-+7% to 55%-+8% (ns) and became abnormal (<50%) in 2/10 pts. An inverse correlation was observed between H/M and doxorubicin dose (r=-0,51, p<O,OOl~,~ile a weaker correlation was found between EF and H/M (r=0,38, p<O,01). A H/M less than 1,73 was observed in none of pts off doxorubicin, 3/13 pts at low-intermediate doses (100--300 mg/m2) and 5/10 pts at higher doses. A low (<50%) EF was observed in 2/13 pts at low intermediate doses and 2/10 pts at higher doses. In conclusion I123-MIBG uptake decreases in a doxorubicin dose-dependent way indicating a cardiac neurotoxic effect; this phenomenon appears ~rly in some pts before EF deterioration.",

However; those modalltles have certain limitations particularly in young women with dense breasts, fibroadenomas and focal fibrous disease of the breast. Because of lack mammographical specificity, many biopsies have been done for pathologically proven benign breast masses. In this respect, the alm of this study was to evaluate the feaslbili~ of 99m-Tc MIBI as a tumor locallslng agent in patients with palpable breast masses in cQmparison with mammography. 41 patients with palpable breast masses were studied by 99m-Tc MIBI breast imaging. All images were evaluated by two nuclear medicine specialistis, and loealised increased uptake of MIBI was accepted as positive. Final histopathological diagnosis was achieved through excisional biopsy, Mammog~aphy could reveal all o( the malignant breast masses but differential diagnosis of fibroadenomas could not be achieved. 25 of 27 breast carcinomas were detected using 99m-Tc MIBI scintlgraphy. 2 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma showed abcent MIBI accumulation. The smallest breast malignancy detected by MIBI study had a measured dimention of 1.5 x 2 cm. Eight of 14 axil[a~/metastases showed positive uptake (57%). On the other hand; 12 of 14 patients with pathologically proven benign breast lesions did not demonstrate any MIBi accumulation. Focal 99m-Tc Mtl]l uptake could be observed in two fibroadenomas. The sensitivity and the specificity of mammography in differential diagnosis of breast lesions were 100% and 78% and of MIBI analysis were 93% and 86%, respectively.",

Short-comings of this procedure is.the fact that a benign fibroadenoma was imaged thus lowering the specificity, and the high cost of the radiopharmaceutical which prohibits its everyday use. The introduction of a larger number of patients in this continuing study and the use of $PECT is expected to provide more objective conclusions, PET-FDG imaging has been shown to accurately identify large breast tumors, but little PET data exist in the initial diagnostic workup of small breast lesions detected by mammography. Twenty-one patients scheduled for exploratory breast surgery were studied with FDG-PET (Siemens ECAT 951R). Dynamic FDG-PET scans of the breast were obtained for 60 minutes followed by PET imaging of the axillas for 15 rain. Time activity curves were evaluated and standardized uptake values for FDG calculated based on attenuation corrected images acquired between 45 -60 rain after tracer injection. Twenty-two malignant lesions in 17 patients could be identified with FDG-PET (SUV 3.6_+1.8). An increased FDG uptake (SUV 3.4 and 3.8) was found in two patients with a carcinoma in situ. Benign lesions such as mammary dysplasia (n=5) and fibroadenomas (n=2) showed a significant lower FDG accumulation (SUV 1.3-+0.2) than malignant tumors (p<0,01). Tumor FDG uptake correlated with in-vitro human nuclear cell proliferationassociated antigenbinding (Ki-67) in tumor tissue of 11 patients. Axillary lymph node dissection in 15 patients showed in 7 cases axillary lymph node involvement. True positive FDG uptake was seen in 4 patients. 3 patients had false negative findings with lymph nodes size smaller than 1 cm in diameter.",

Fibroadenomas and areas with mammary dysplasia had significant lower glucose metabolism. The observed high specificity has to be confirmed in a larger patient population with benign tumors. Detection of lymph node involvement appears to be limited by partial volume effect. FDG-PET may be clinically useful in the early diagnostic workup of patients with abnormal marnmography. (WD) is a hereditary disorder of copper metabolism leading to striatal degeneration and liver cirrhosis. It may be treated either by decoppering drugs such as D-penicillamine (DPA) or by liver transplantation (IT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of these therapeutic modalities on striatal glucose consumption (rCMRGIc). Using FDG and the PET-camera PC-4096 the striatal glucose consumption was measured in 25 normal volunteers and 14 WD patients. In 3 of the patients LT had been performed 1 to 6 years before their inclusion in the study. I1 of the patients were treated by DPA. Whereas in 4 of these decoppering therapy had just been started before the PET study, the duration of DPA therapy was longer than 5 years in the remaining 7 patients. The normal limits of striatal rCMRGlc were calculated as 95% confidence limits of the normal data using Student's t-values. While striatal rCMRGlc was markedly reduced below normal in tbe 4 patients with short duration of DPA therapy, it was in the lower normal range in the patients with long-standing medication. In the latter group striatal glucose consumption correlated negatively with the duration of medication and the urinary excretion of copper (p<0.01). The patients in whom LT had been performed also had normal values of striatal rCMRGlc.",

Whether early use of FDG-PET in cases of unclear breast disease and for staging in breast cancer benefits patients, needs to be demonstrated. Posttraumatic Parkinson-syndrome (PPS) can occur after severe head injuries with inner inferior cerebral trauma. L-DOPA-therapy can be helpful in some cases, while others show no response. Considering the pathogenesis of this syndrome either a destruction of dopamine-receptors (DR) in the striatum or a disruption of neural transport systems could be responsible for PPS. To analyze mechanisms responsible ffor PPS we studied 5 pts. with PPS doing 99mTc-HMPAO-perCusion-SPECT and 123 I-IBZM-D2-recep~ tor-SPECT 1 week after the perfusion study and after apomorphine tests. SPECT-images were obtained with a single-head-rotating-camera 10 min. p.i. of 555 MBq 99mTc-HMPAO and 2 hrs. p.i. of 185 MBq 123 I-IBZM. 3 pts. were also studied after L-DOPA-therapy ffor 6 weeks and after L-DOPA had been withdrawn for 7 days. All pts. showed perfusion defects (4 bilateral) initially, in 4 cases also in the striatum (2 bilateral). IBZM-SPECT showed uptake defects in basal ganglia only in 4 pts. (i bilateral) of which i had the defect in the contralateral side of the perfusion defect. Control scans in 3 pts. showed normal IBZN-uptake in all pts., which had all improved under L-DOPA-therapy. Our findings suggest that HMPAO-and IBZM-SPECT together with apomorphine tests can predict the response to L-DOPA-therapy in pts. with grossly abnormal perfusion scans but with at least partially functioning DR.

The results are in the following We conclude that early SPECT BP imaging (within one week) following closed HI is more sensitive than delayed imaging (more than three weeks). This is due to recovery and repair of lesions detected in early imaging. We encourage EP imaging following minor to moderate head injury in the first week. This might help explain the psychological and behavioral complaints of these patients in the absence of CT or MRI abnormalities. An ideal project would be to follow up the same group of patients with early and delayed BP imaging and to correlate with neuropsychological testing.",

RCBF  IN  HEROIN  AND  POLYDRUG  ADDICTS  EVALUTED BY 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT: TEMPORAL LOBE  INVOLVEMENT In drug addicts, namely in cocaine abusers, PET studies have revealed metabolic abnormalities. However, the effects of heroin dependence on cerebral perfusion have not yet been investigated systematically. We evaluated 37 in-patients by means of 99mTC-HMPAO-SPECT (40 investigations). HIV testing was negative in all individuals. Five patients were dependent only on heroin. Twentythree additionally took cannabis, 22 benzodiazepines or barbiturates, 11 cocaine, and 9 amphetamine. In addition to visual evaluation, 31 ROIs were drawn for semiquantative analysis. Both temporal and frontal regions showed the most striking blood flow abnormalities with right-sided preponderance. Thirty patients (75 %) had a hypoperfusion. Among them, the right temporal lobe presented with reduced blood flow in 32%, the left temporal region in 18%. A decreased perfusion of the right frontal lobe was observed in 11%. The right parietal and the right oceipital areas were involved in 9%. -Furthermore, combined addiction of cocaine and heroin significantly correlated with hypoperfusion of the right frontal lobe (p < 0.01). Abuse of amphetamines along with heroin was related to left lateral temporal hypoperfusion (p < 0.005), that of barbiturates along with heroin with left mesial temporal hypoperfusion (p < 0.005). However, there were no major perfusion differences when comparing polydrug addicts and individuals dependent only on heroin. Thus, our most striking finding, the hypoperfusion of the right temporal lobe in heroin (heroin alone or combined with other drugs) addicts, seems to be related to the heroin abuse itself.-In conclusion, the results presented here indicate abnormal cerebral perfusion patterns in heroin addicts predominantly of the right hemisphere. The preponderant right temporal lobe involvement might be related to the marked opiate receptor density of that region. ",

Two grams of 5-ASA in 50 ml enema were mixed with 30-40 MBq of 99mTc colloids and administered. Dynamic images (1/min) of the abdomen in anterior view were obtained for 1 h, static (1 rain) images from 2nd to 6th hour. Semiquantitative analysis was performed obtaining an Ileal Percentual Activity (IPA) from ROls drawn over the ileum and rectum. Two patterns of rectal wall contraction were recognized in 1 st hour images: A) parietal rectal motility with RIS (2-1 l/h, mean 3.8); B) parietal rectal motility without RIS (9-21/h, mean 12.1).5-ASA plasma levels were measured with HPLC before, 30, 60 min and hourly for 6 h after administration. 5-ASA absorption was expressed by the integral Area Under time/plasma level Curve (AUC) in lag/ml/h. Mean IPA were 14.5+16 % and 8.7+6.1%, mean AUC values were 0.5+_0.2 and 4.3+3.8 in the 1st hour and 2nd-6th hours periods respectively. IPA and AUC values during the 1st hour were positively correlated (Spearman rank test, p=0.03) but not in 2nd-6th hours period. First hour AUC were lower in IRA than in a control group previously studied.Two IRA patients showed higher AUC than normal whereas three had lower AUC values.Patients with more than nine RIS/hour had the higher AUC values. The technique detects RIS presence and degree of a 5-ASA enema by quantitative parameters, revealing the rectal motility as a major cause of RIS related high 5-ASA absorption in topically rectal treated UC patients wih IRA.

Significant differences were found between high, intermediate, or low grade carcinomas (GI: 4.34-1.1; G2: 6.2.~0.7; G3:t0.34-2.1 [DUR]/p<.05) while the correlation between FDG-uptake and proliferation was poor (~--0.65). Tumor size did not influence the magnitude of FDG-aecumulation. Chrortie pancreatitis present in 8 patients was characterized by low FDGuptake (DUR: 3.0-a:I.2) except for one (DUR: 5.2). Surgical specimens of the latter revealed leukocyte-rich tryptical necroses as sign of active inflammation.

LS was performed during the first week of hospitalization (mean: 4.3 days). Mixed, autologous leukocytes, labeled with 99mTc-HM-PAO in vitro were used. The uptake in the view of the pancreas was classified as none, moderate or intense. Clinical features, laboratory parameters (the baseline amylase level and the amylase level 10 days following LS) and the outcome were registered during hospitalization. In group 1, 11 of the 22 LS proved positive. 4 of these cases had infected pancreatic necrosis, confirmed by surgery; other patients were successfully treated with antibiotics. The grade of leukocyte accumulation correlated with the duration of hospitalization (r:0.45, p<0.05) and with the late amylase level (r:0.57, p<0.01). Baseline laboratory findings showed no correlation with these parameters. In group 2, 4 patients had positive LS; 3 of them were operated on, and pancreatic abscess was detected in all cases. In 3 of the 7 cases with normal LS, surgery revealed a noninfected pancreatic pseudocyst. Conclusion: Leukocyte infiltration into the pancreas can be demonstrated by LS. Positive LS indicated a severe course of acute panereatitis, with a special need for antibiotic and/or surgical treatment. LS was also useful for differentiation between infected and noninfected psuedocysts in chronic pancreatitis.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the transmission source activity, e.i. of the number of transmission coincidences, on the quantitative accuracy of reconstructed PET images. The study was performed with the PET-Scanner PC4096-I5WB. A first phase was based on phantom measurements in form of brain simulation, the results of which have been already shown elsewhere. The second phase consisted of patient measurements: five brain studies and four heart measurements. Different transmission scans collected 0.5 to about 12 million coincidences. In case of brain studies, Regions of Interest (ROI) were drawn on whole cortex, thalamus, and white matter; for the heart studies one ROI was drawn on the myocurd. The results of the phantom measurements were confirmed by the patient studies. With transmission coincidences of -> 2.5 million per slice for the brain (left figure) and of -> 6 to 8 million for the heart measurement (right figure) constant values of activity concentration with a variance up to +/-6% were found. The corresponding standard deviations yielded values up to about 20% variance for brain studies, but of only 1% for heart measurements. For lower values than 2.5 and 7 million of coincidences, respectively, the results confirmed again the phantom measurements: the reconstructed images showed lower concentration values with higher standard deviations, but also image artifacts, due to an erroneous attenuation correction. This study, together with the first phase of phantom measurements, confirmes that the transmission source activity influences strongly the quantitative reliability of PET images, but also that the transmission scan length can be shortened to a minimum as result of an optimally planned measurement schedule. The ability of PE T to determine the spatial distribution of activity concentration in vivo is mostly due to the possibility to do an exact attenuation correction. The accuracy of this correction influences strongly the accuracy of quantitation, because typically the correction factors are in the range of 500-2000 %. As the correction is based on a transmission scan, in theory complex object geometries with nonhomogeneous attenuation coefficients can be treated. Practically, however, there are problems mainly due to the limited statistics of the transmission scan. This is especially true for modem scanners with high transverse and axial resolution and therefore fine spatial sampling. So a single correction factor typically is based only on 40 counts for brain-and 0.5-30 counts for abdominal imaging. Without any processing the associated noise completely destroys the emission image. By smoothing the transmission data this effect can be reduced, but the transmission spatial resolution is degraded from 6 mm tol2 mm. So at the borders between changing attenuation coefficients systematic errors are introduced. So contrast for a cold, airfilled sphere is reduced from 70 % to 65 % (40 mm in dia.) or from 30 % to 17 % (15 mm dia.), respectively. Using realistic phantom setups with different attenuation coefficients simulating tissue, lung, and bone the problems of attenuation correction, dependent on the degree of smoothing (2-or 3-dimensional, repeated application), are demonstrated. The data are compared to the results of an analytical correction assuming constant ~t, which introduces unacceptable errors (e.g. changes image activity concentration from cold to hot) for these complex geometries.",

            "text": "413 Results: 50 years after the beginning of a progressive iodine supplementation via kitchen salt in Switzerland, NIH is still the most frequent form of hyperthyroidism in Berne. Over the 18 year period evaluated, the IH proportion remained constant. Within a constant share of 60% of NIH, the TA/MFA ratio dropped from 2.4 (1976) over 0.9 (1982) to 0.4 (1991 ) . A decreasing proportion of TA and a rising MFA frequency could be markers of the progressively diminishing iodine deficiency. Indeed, the urinary excretion of iodine, from 30 pg/g creatinine in 1920, had risen (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) ) to a level above 100 pg/g creatinine (WHO standard), to drop again, in 1992, to a 87-+36 pg/g creatinine level. A rising proportion of TA seems to be a marker of an increasing or newly installed iodine deficiency, as has recently been observed in several parts of the European continent. Thus, the epidemiology of hyperthyroidism is in continuous change in a prealpine country. The previously available imaging procedures -CT and MRI -have been used routinely in cases of endocrine orbitopathy (EO) to characterise morphological aspects of the retrobulbar space. These methods, however, do not provide information related to functional aspects. The capability of the somatostatin analogon Octreotide to localize activated lymphocytes in inflamatory lesions provides investigators with a new tool for this task. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical findings with both MRI and Octreoscan in cases of EO. A series of 11 patients with Graves' disease were included in the study. The ophthalmological score was determined according to Mourits' scale. Both eye muscle thickening and eye muscle oedema were taken as parameters of the MRI investigation. For the Octreoscan studies 111MBq 111-In-Octreotide were injected i.v., planar and SPECT images were taken 2 hours p.i. A study was called positive if tracer accumulation was documented in at least two corresponding slices after SPECT reconstruction of the orbital region. A higher rate of positive findings was seen with the Octreoscan (88%). On the other hand, muscle thickening was apparent in 66% and oedema only in 55\u00b0/'0 of the cases. The opthalmological score correlated well with the Octreoscan results. In this preliminary evaluation, retroorbital changes seem to be more apparent in the Octreoscan as compared to MRI imaging. The underlying pathogenetical mechanism reason for this could be the presence of activated lymphocytes. Development of cholestasis after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in children may be related to various causes, i.e. graft rejection, hepatitis, or segmental biliary stenosis (BS). This latter complication may be suspected by ultrasound (US) when bile ducts are dilated. Since functional biliary alterations may precede morphological alterations, we have now evaluated the usefulness of hepatobiliary scintigraphy in the early detection orBS when US is still normal. We have reviewed 131 consecutive scans performed in 85 post-OLT children with cholestasis and normal US, including 14 patients (18 studies) with proven BS and 71 patients (113 studies) without stenosis (NBS). Bile ducts activity was visually graded G1 (no or faint bile ducts visualization during less than 60 min) or G2 (bile ducts visualization exceeding 60 min with or without tracer pooling). Hepatic and bile ducts time/activity curves were generated in order to obtain quantitative parameters of biliary activity and clearance. The diagnosis of BS was confirmed in 4 of the 108 G1 studies and in 14 of the 23 G2 studies, indicating for the visual method a sensitivity of 78%, a specificity of 96%, a negative predictive value of 96% and a positive predictive value of 6 I%. Although the mean quantitative parameters were different in patients with and without biliary stenosis and correlated with visual grading, all values observed in BS were in the range of those observed in NBS. Conclusion: 1.visual grading of the biliary activity is effective in the early detection ofbiliary stenosis in post-OLT children, 2. quantitative data analysis does not improve the accuracy of the method. Not only the skeletal muscle but also the myocardium is one of the target organs of thyroid hormones. In 15 hypothyroid (TSH > 30 gIE/mI) patients with thyroid carcinoma after thyreoidectomy and radio iodine therapie, additionally phosphorous-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-MRS) was performed before iodine-131 -whole-body-scintigraphy. It was assessed, whether alterations of the myocardial phosphate metabolism occur with hypothyroidism similar as in skeletal muscle. For comparison it was proved, whether left ventricular function of these patients is decreased at rest. In patients and 15 healthy volunteers P-MRS (volume selection method ISIS at the anterior, lateral, and septal left ventricular wall; EKG-triggering, repetition time = 3 s; average of 512 endsystolic measurements) and magnetic resonance imaging (dynamic mid-ventricular transverse and sagittal oblique gradientecho (GE) scans) were applied. The ratio of the peak-areas of phosphocreatine (PCr) and B-ATP has been designed as parameter for the status of the myocardial phosphate metabolism. Values were corrected for partial saturation and contamination with blood. Left ventricular function has been evaluated quantitatively measuring the ejection fraction (EF) by the area length method on the GE-scans. In comparison to the normal subjects with a PCr/g-ATP-ratio of 1.79 _+ 0.21, this ratio and, therefore, first of all the PCr of the patients with 1.23 + 0.32 was significantly decreased (p = 0.005). Besides the decrease of PCr, only 5 of the 15 patients showed a diminished left ventricle function at rest with EF values below 50 %. Left ventricnlar dilatation or myocardial thinning was not observed. This results emphasize that hypothyroidism affects the phosphate metabolism of the myocardium. The drop of PCr was unexpectedly marked. By this means, at least at rest no high grade reduction of left ventricuIar function was caused. Presently, the consistency of the existing results is proved by enlargment of the patient group and control examinations at euthyroidism. ",

Aim of the present study is to evaluate the hepatobiliary function by the aid of trimethyl-Br-IDA-99m-Tc (TMBIDA) scan, in 48 children with Cystic Fibrosis and clinical or US signs of known or suspected associated liver disease. Four groups of pts were evaluable: 20 with liver cirrhosis (LC), 13 with not cirrhotic-liver involvement, 15 with no liver involvement (8 with biliary sludge and 7 with meconium ileus). In 29 pts, the scan was repeated 11-36 months after therapy with Ursodeoxicholic acid (UDCA), with a total of 87 scintigraphy. Morphological abnormalities, hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) and time of visualization of intestine (TI) were evaluated after i.v. inj. of 111-185 MBq of TMBIDA. Parenchymal abnormalities and bile ducts dilatation were observed in 27/48 pts (56%) with a slight difference when comparing LC vs the other groups (70% vs 46%). HEF and TI were slightly prolonged in pts with LC (30.2 and 28.3 min, respectively) and in pts with elevation of liver function tests (28.8 and 28 rain), in comparison with all the other pts, irrespectively to the clinical group. Both morphological and functional parameters improved, according with the clinical status, after UDCA therapy in all but 2 LC pts. In conclusion our data demonstrated that scintigraphy well correlates with clinical status and it is a good parameter of treatment responsivity. Moreover it allows to identify liver abnormalities in 2/3 ofpts without signs of liver disease. The biliary reflux was seen in 14 children (44 Z), the results were vague in 6 (18 %), the test was negative in 12 (38 %). Reflux index was 3.4 +/-1.1%. Control scintigraphy was performed i n 8 children after the treatment with cisapride and revealed the withdrawal of the reflux in T, with persistence in i. This was in accordance with clinical symptoms.",

Because 1-131-MIBG allows delayed imaging, it is reported to have a higher sensitivity than 1-123-MIBG. To study the sensitivity of 1-123-MIBG we evaluated all MIBG scans performed between 1984 and 1992 in 91 children suspicious for neuroblastoma using I-123-MIBG exclusively. 50 males and 41 females were studied.

The results of MIBG scans were compared to those of other imaging techniques (ultrasound, X-ray, MRI, CT, bone scan), of catecholamine levels in urine and plasma, of Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) levels in plasma, and of bone marrow histology/cytology. Neuroblastoraa was confirmed histologically in 81/91 children and excluded in 10 children. The primary tumor was localized in the abdomen in 60, in the chest in 18, in the neck in 2, and in one case in the pelvis. 48 of the children were in stage IV, 19 stage III, 9 stage I or II, and 5 were in stage IVS. 55 out of 81 children had metastases: 12 bone marrow, 4 bone, 25 both bone marrow and bone involvement. 26 children had soft tissue metastases (8 liver, 4 intracerebral, 2 scrotal and 12 lymph node).",

They were either refractary to conventional therapy or showed disease relapse after initial successful treatment, in one patient the MIBG was given as a consolidation therapy. II children were on stage IV and 2 on stage Ill. Chosen criteria were: positive I~+I-MIBG in all tumoral lesions and no bone marrow involvement. Many of the patients had received previous intensive therapy, so depression of pre-treatment blood cell count has been in cases a limiting factor for treatment. A total of 59 MIBG courses were administered by infusion. In most children the dose was divided into two portions each infused over a period of 4 hours with a 24 hr, interval between them.

Besides being a relatively inexpensive PET radiopharmaceutical, imaging with Co-55 can be delayed 24 hours after the acute ischemic event, making it a convenient tool for aiding patient selection for a more aggressive anti-ischemic treatment, determining early prognosis and therapy evaluation. To estimate the disagreement between stress (ST)-redistribution (RD) mid reinjection (RI) imaging, 12 experienced Nucl. Med. Depts. enrolled 402 patients with at least one ST perfusion defect. To eliminate external sources of variability the same type of gamma camera, acquisition protocol and computer software was used for three views planar imaging of a conventional 3-4 hour ST/RD study. A new set of images was acquired 30 min after T1-201 RI performed ha the same day (Group A, n=230) or in a different day (Group B, n=i72) from to the ST/RD study. Four hour delayed imaging after RI was repeated in Group B only. The left ventricle was divided into 13 segments and blindly evaluated, in a core center, by 3 independent observers, according to a 5-pohat scale (0 =normal, 4=no uptake). Reversibility was defined as a shift towards normal of -> 1 grade on subsequent images. Of the 5195 evaluable segments, 2058 (40%) had ST perfusion defects, of which 566 (27%) were severe irreversible defects (SID: score 3-4). After RD, 1313 (64%) defects remained totally irreversible (TID) and 415 of them (32%) were SID. After RI the number of TID decreased to 1033 (50%), 341 (33%) of which were SID. When comparhag RI with RD imaging 403 (31%) out of the 1313 TID and 105 (25%) out of the 415 SID at RD improved after T1-201 RI. The change in segmental uptake was of only one degree on the scoring scale ha 91% of segments evaluated after RI. In Group B the agreement in die segmental scoring of TI-201 perfusion defects, at early and delayed imaging after RI, was excellent (Kw = 0.947). ha conclusion the improvment in TI-201 activity after RI of apparently irreversible defects after conventional ST/RD study is reproducible also when a strictly controlled methodology of image acquisition and analysis is adopted. In a large and unselected population of ischemic pts, the segmental prevalence of this phenomenon is less than previously repoll.ed. No significant differences were found when comparing early mad delayed imaging after RI. * SIRT: Italian Multicentre Study on Thallium Reinjecfion. The protective role of collateral blood flow on myocardium sustended by stenosed coronary arteries has long been recognized. Its role on the diagnostic performance of dipyridamole stress test has not been established. 26 patients with well-developed intercoronary collaterals and 12 control pts without collaterals were studied at rest and after dipyridamole infusion (0.84 mg/kg). The regional myocardial activity of SESTAMIBI was measured with SPECT using a 5-point scoring system and 13 segments.

Mab 88BV59 (IgG Kappa 3 subclass, 170 KD) is a panadenocarcinoma antibody which detects a cytokeratin-like antigen and has been shown to react with >90% of primary colorectal cancers as well as with recurrences and metastases. ISC (8 anterior/posterior planar images as well as SPECT of the abdomen and pelvis) was performed 18 to 20 hrs after injection of 1.1 GBq (30 mCi) Tc-99m-88BV59 (9.46 mg). The scintigraphic results were compared to CT scan and sonography; all patients subsequently underwent surgery thus allowing to evaluate the immunoscintigraphic findings histologically. There were no adverse effects and no human anti-human (HAHA) responses. Labelling efficacy reached from 97 to 99.9%. The detection rate was 2/2 for primary tumors, 6/7 for liver metastases, 2/2 for lymph node involvement, and 2/2 for recurrences.

Tetrofosmin is a new technetium labelled lipophilic cation evaluated for use as a myocardial perfusion tracer. Same day stress/rest planar and tomographic images obtained as part of the phase III clinical trial were compared to planar thallium and to angiography in 72 patients with definite or suspected coronary artery disease. Studies were processed on a common computer and read separately by four investigators unaware of patients identification. 42 patients had previous and 30 no previous myocardial infarction. 38 patients had multiple vessel disease (lesions _> 50%) and a total of 111 arteries had stenosis. Spect tetrofosmin was normal in 8 of the 9 patients without significant coronary lesion, thallium planar and tetrofosmin planar images were normal in 7 of these 9 patients. 12 of 13 patients with previous myocardial infarction and single (10) or no (3) residual vessel lesion had tetrofosmin Spect abnormalities versus 9 with planar thallium and 8 with planar tetrofosmin. 26 of 29 patients with multiple vessel disease and previous myocardial infarction had fixed defects (11 patients) or partially reversible defects (15 patients) as compared to 9 and 13 respectively with planar tetrofosmin and to 7 and 16 respectively with planar thallium. Finally Spect tetrofosmin demonstrated stress abnormalities in 17 of 21 patients without myocardial infarction as compared with 14 using planar tetrofosmin and 13 using planar thallium. Overall, Spect tetrofosmin recognized disease in 69 arterial territories versus 59 for planar tetrofosmin and 58 for thallium. We conclude that the use of Spect plays a major role in the improved sensitivity and specificity demonstrable using Tc-99m tetrofosmin. The aim of this study was to compare diagnostic accuracy and kinetics of two 99mTc-labeled monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies (MAbs) (complete versus fragmented) in colorectal cancer patients intraindividually. 22 patients were investigated with both MAbs within one week: 740-1295 MBq of the complete IgG1 MAb BW431/26 (1.5 mg of protein; Behringwerke FRG) and of the F(ab')2/Fab\" fragment mixture F023C5 (0.35 rag; Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia, Italy) were injected intravenously. Planar and whole body scans were performed 1, 4, 24 and in special cases 48 h p.i., SPECT after 4 and 24 hours. The following localizations could be visualized (F023C5-posJBW431-pos./all lesions): Primary tumors 2/1/2, locoregional recurrences 10/8/10, liver metastases 12/10/14, kidney met. 0/1/1, lung met. 0/1/1, lymph node met. 6/5/6, bone met. 2/2/2, brain met. 2/2/3, peritoneal carcinoses 4/3/4. SPECT was superior to planar scans in 35%, especially in locoregional recurrence, liver, kidney and lung met. With MAb fragments, tumor detection was possible in 17% after lh, in 94% after 4h, whereas with complete MAb, in 48% 24h or even 48h scans were necessary. The tumor/background ratio of liver metastases was significantly lower with fragments, compared to complete MAb (1.24+0.10 vs. 1.67-+0.32; p<0.01). In conclusion, with fragments (due to faster whole body clearance), tumor detection is possible with higher sensitivity earlier p.i. in comparison to whole IgG1. Therefore, for Tclabeling with its short physical half-life, fragments seem to be more suitable. The lower tumor / background ratio of liver metastases results probably from the lower antigen affinity known for fragments, despite their higher sensitivity.",

IS proved to be more specific in case of previous irradiation (no false positives) and is the method of choice in case of unknown tumor location (screening by use of whole body scanning). The biodistribution of mIn-pentetreotide (rain-P) was measured m vivo in 44 patients with suspicion of GEPnt. Patient preparation included administration of laxatives and withdrawal of octreotide therapy. Patients were imaged 4 and 24h after injection of-200MBq m In-P. Organ and tumor activity was determined using the geometric mean method and expressed as % injected dose (%ID) or by quantitative SPECT and expressed as %ID/100ml. The diagnosis of GEPnt was proven in 36 patients and mIn-P was positive in 31 cases and negative in 13. Total liver (L) and spleen (S) activity was similar at 4h (L:3.7+1.2, S:2.8+1.6%ID) and 24h (L:4.0_+1.7, S:3.0_+1.8%ID). Kidneys (K) activity decreased from 5.9+2.5%ID at 4h to 5.1+1.8 at 24h (p<.001) and a mean decrease of 62% was measured over background areas. At 24h, the activity expressed as %ID/I00ml was 4-fold lower in L (0.2+0.1) compared to S (0.8__+0.5) or K (0.8+0.4). No differences in L, S or K uptake were observed in patients with positive or negative scans. At 24h, the thyroid was visualized in 92% of patients (0.02+0.02%ID), the pituitary in 74%, gallbladder in 14% and breast in 18% of females. Bowel activity was se~n in 19% of patients at 4h and 91% at 24h. The tumor activity was similar at 4h (0.01 to 20%ID; median 0.28;n=50) and 24h (0.02 to 18%ID; median 0.31). At 24h, the median tumor uptake was 0.81%ID/100ml with a median tumor/liver ratio of 3.8 (range: 0.8-29.3, n=59) . Conclusions: I) with the exception of kidneys, the tumor and organ uptake of mIn-P remains stable between 4 and 24h, 2) in GEPnt patients, mIn-P provides a high target-to-nontarget ratio. In a prospective longitudinal study of 197 cases of dementia (mean age 73.2 range 39-95) and 114 controls (mean age 70 range 34-94) annual medial temporal lobe (MTL) oriented X-ray CT and Tc-99M HMPAO SPET scans are used to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of structural and functional neuroimaging in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Some subjects have bad seven annual evaluations. So far of 90 who have died, 87 have come to post mortem (PM)(97%). 52 had more than 1 annual scan (lx6, 5x4, 19x3, 27x2) . Histology is known for 77:52 had AD (27 >1 annual scan), 17 had other dementias (12 >1 annual scan) and 8 controls had no CNS pathology (7 > 1 annual scan). The combination of MTL atrophy and parietotemporal (PT) hypoperfusion on SPET is thought to predict AD. We assessd scans for significant MTL atrophy (<0.79 multiples of median for age), PT hypoperfusion, and the combination of both, at intervals before PM and up to 28/2/94 in the living controls (see table) . Both criteria have been positive at least 56 months before death in confirmed AD, are much less common in other dementias and virtually absent in controls. 48-60+ 2/3 2/3 2/3 0/1 0/1 0/1 2/18 0/19 0/19 The rate of MTL atrophy in AD (1.89mm/yr,95%CI 1.25-2.54) is an order of magnitude greater than controls (0.21mm/yr,95%CI 0.02-0.39) and correlates directly with cognitive decline. Such dramatic MTL atrophy suggests that AD is a disease rather than the inevitable consequence of ageing. These findings have important aetiologie, diagnostic and therapeutic implications. The validity of clinical testing is not possible in all patients with PA, due to frequent difficulties in applying neuropsychometric tests. Structural neuroimaging can be normal or show typically left perisylvian atrophy in some patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of HMPAO,SPECT as a diagnostic tool in PA, in comparison with MR/and clinical follow-up. HMPAO brain SPECT was performed on I 1 patients (10F, mean age 68_+8 yrs) with a mean of 4 yrs of language dysfunction (range 2-15 yrs). All patients underwent a MR/ study. Criteria of inclusion were: 1) a history of unexplained progressive language disturbance and 2) the absence of other cognitive impairment for at least 2 yrs after the onset of aphasia. During a 8-33 months follow-up, 5 patients were re-examined by SPECT (4 once and 1 twice). The presence of atrophy (MR/) and hypoperfusion (SPECT) were graded as absent (a), mild (ml), moderate (md) or severe (s).",

The mean frontal/cerebellar cortex ratio of subjects without activation was significantly higher than those of other group, either at baseline (i.011 vs 0.971) or after diazepam (1.013 vs 0.944).

In 13/21 patients bone marrow defects resulted from bone marrow biopsy (3 pts), proven spondylodiscitis (3 pts.), state after surgery (3 pts.), acute compression fracture of a single vertebral body ( 2 pts.), total hip prothesis (1 pt.), and known hemangioma of vertebral body (1 Pt). Among the residual 8 patients there were two patients with fever of unknown origin and spondylodiscitis was supposed but not yet proven. 6 patients showed solitary unexplained defects.These were solitary lesions in2 patients located in lumbal vertebral body V, in one patient in lumbal vertebral body III/IV, in 2 patients in the iliosacral joint and in one patient in pubic bone. In summary we found in only 6 of 109 patients (5.5%) unexplained photopenic defects in bone marrow. We conclude that immunoscintigraphy of hematopoietic bone marrow shows a homogenous bone marrow scan pattern in 95 % of a medium aged patient population.

Internal derangement is found among the most frequent disorders of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), characterized by a disruption of the internal aspects of the TMJ with abnormal relationship and structural alterations of the components. A classification is possible according to Mill findings. However, clinical observations not always coincide with MRI results.

SPECT was performed with a 3-headed camera equipped with an UHR collimator (Multispect 3, Siemens), matrix size 128x128. Visual and semiquantitative evaluation was carried out by two independent observers. Uptake values greater than those in the ipsilateral petrous bone were considered as pathological. MRI {mages were obtained in 69 TMJ/37 patients: Stage I (n=17) displacement of the disc with reduction, II (n=4) nonreducing disc, III (n=20) significant deformity of the disc, moderate osseous alterations and/or adhesions, IV (n=4) progressive osteoarthrosis.

Pathologic uptake was seen in 31/69 TMJ, all of them having positive MRI findings: n=l 1 belonged to stage I, n=2 to stage II, n=14 to stage III, n=4 to stage IV. The results of this study indicate a good correlation between SPECT and MRI findings in the later stages of internal derangement. False positive results have not been observed. The diagnostic benefit of SPECT seems to lie in the detection of minimal osseous changes in the early stages of the disease.

            "text": "As the potential of image investigation of in vivo human biochemistry has been well validated, nuclear medicine must now turn its attention to the development of original radiopharmaceuticals with unique biochemical properties. For receptor studies in SPECT, numerous radioligands htbelled with 1-123 have been described. They are mostly antagonists and possess high affinity for binding sites. One should be careful in the interpretation of \"receptor images\" since these ligands are initially distributed with flow and then may demonstrate an uptake which may not be necessarily correlated with receptor density. For example, PET data obtained with C-11 MQNB indicate that its cardiac uptake represents only flow at all times after injection. For C-11 Flumazenil, early cerebral cortex uptake images are mostly flow images while late uptake images are more correlated with receptor density. A precise understanding of receptor ligand uptake can be obtained with PET through dynamic acquisitions and compartmental modeling to quantify receptor binding parameters (density Bmax and affinity Kd). SPECT technology does not allow so far rapid dynamic imaging of receptor ligand distribution and compartmental modeling cannot be obtained. Consequently, in SPECT, the interpretation of the distribution of a receptor ligand is not straight forward and simplifications are needed. A transfer of knowledge from PET to SPECT may be an adequate mean for establishing simple and direct ewlluation of SPECT images. For exanlple, fi'om the modeling the striatal uplake with Br-76 Lisuride on D2 receptors, one can show that, all parameters being kept constant, Bmax is well correlated with the striamm to cerebellum ratio of radioactive concentrations S/C. Atthough this conclusion cannot be directly extrapolated in patients, the ratio S/C has been proved to be useful in clinical practice. In conclusion, the future impact of receptor Iigands in SPECT depends on the selection of those radiopharmaceuticals with adequate pharmacological characteristics allowing their radioactive distribution to parallel specific binding. A COMPUTER MODEL TO ASSESS RADIOACTIVE GAS DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE LUNG A computer model has been developed to simulate the transport of short-lived radioactive gases within the lung. The erect lung is divided into upper, middle and lower zones. Associated with each zone is an alveolar compartment and a regional deadspace compartment; the deadspace compartments are connected via a common deadspace volume. All compartment volumes are derived from Weibel's Lung Model A (1963).",

Including regions of impaired function within the model gives errors of 40%. In conclusion, the computer lung model is a useful tool to simulate the distribution of short-lived radioactive gases within the lung and has demonstrated that existing quantitative techniques are inaccurate when applied to patient data where pulmonary airways abnormality is present. [ 1-11C]-acetate has been recognized as a suitable tracer for assessing myocardial oxidative metabolism with dynamic PET. The close correlation between tissue clearance and oxygen consumption has been demonstrated using mono-and bi-exponential fitting as well as mean transit time approaches. A direct biochemical interpretation of the various parameters could not be given up to now. We have developed a detailed kinetic model which incorporates the known information of the metabolic fate of acetate in myocardinm in order to investigate which factors influence the actual behaviour of the tissue response. Our simulations show that the reproduction of measured impuls responses requires at least a 4-tissue-compartment model. Within our model the relation between the parameters of the usual mono-and bi-exponential fits and the rate constants of the model have been established. Model simplifications are discussed. Further, we address the problem of adequate corrections for spillover and recovery which are necessary in order to assess myocardial blood flow in addition to oxidative metabolism. We show that the formal treatment of spillover as effective fractional blood volume leads under realistic conditions implicitely to a rather good de facto recovery correction. Under these circumstances it is therefore erroneous to perform an additional recovery correction as has frequently been done in the literature. We conclude that the simultaneous quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow and metabolism with [1-11C]-acetate is feasible with effective one-and two-tissue compartment models. Exponential fitting should generally be avoided because of the bias introduced by the effects of finite input duration and recirculation.",

The somatostatln (SS) analog l ll-ln-Pentetreotide has recently allowed to disclose in vivo the presence of SS receptors on pituitary adenomas. We studied 47 patients with pituitary adenoma. Planar images of the brain were acquired after the injection of 110-200 MBq 111-In-pentetreotide. We scored the images by an \"uptake index\" ratio between the adenoma radioactivity and the mean intracranial activity). In 4 patients without pituitary disease the mean score was 2 (range 1.8-2.2).GH secreting adenomas (n=18): the mean U.I. was 3.8 +/-0.4 A direct co=elation (r=0.54; p>0.05) was found between UI scores and the percentages of G H decrease after acute SS injection (100 gamma so), calculated as mean of the first 6 hrs GH levels vs baseline. In 3 patients with NMR evidence of empty sella, the scan did not visualize any intrasellar accumulation of pentetreotide.Sllent GH secreting adenomas (n=3): U.I. was very high (4.8, 9.6, 38); SMS treatment markedly depressed the accumulation of the ligand in the patient with the highest score.Non functioning (NF) adenomas (n-22): mean UI was 4.1 +/-0.9. Scan was positive in 14 (63%) patients. This % ofpositivity is close to the frequency of SS receptors obsen, od in these minors in vitro. In 6 patients with positive scan, long term SMS treatment did not change the accumulation of llgand neither the size of adenoma.]PRL secreting adenomas (n=4): UI was low (moan score 2.5).Conclusions: Pentetreotide scintigraphy shows the presence of SS receptors in a large portion of pim/tary tumccs. In aetomegaly the observed correlation with GH changes after SMS indicates their ftmofionality. In NF adenomas, the poor results so far obtained with SMS treatment on tumor size even in patients with positive SS receptors, point out the lack of fanctional role of the receptors evidenced by scintigraphy in controlling cell proliferation. It is well known that the image resolution of reconstructed PET images influences the quantitation of the observed activity concentration. The lower the image resolution the more unterestimated is the activity uptake in small structures due to the partial volume effect. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of reconstructed image resolution on the kinetic analysis of dynamic PET data, i.e. on the rate constants resulting from a nonlinear regression fitting analysis of the time-activity curves. Dynamic sequences of brain images recorded for 60 min after intravenous injection of F-18-deoxyglucose (FDG) in 4 patients were reconstructed with a Harming filter and 4 different cutoff-frequencies leading to an image resolution of 5.5, 7, 9, and 11 nun (full width at half maximum, FWHM). Cortical regions of interests (ROI) were defined at an isocontour level of 50% at the maximum of the FDG-images summed from 30 to 60 rain after injection. The ROIs became larger with decreased image resolution. Using these ROIs cortical timeactivity curves were obtained. The plasma time-activity curve was derived from arterialized venous blood. Applying the well-established three-compartment model for FDG the rate constants were determined by a nonlinear regression fitting procedure, which was based on the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. For the best image resolution of 5.5 mm FWHM the resulting values of K1, k 2, k 3 and k 4 were 0.121+0.011, 0.223\u00b10.076, 0.116x'-0.026 and 0.005_+0.005, respectively. All rate constants became higher when the image resolution was decreased. With the lowest image resolution of 11 mm FWHM K1, k2, k 3 and k 4 increased to 105\u00b15%, 134\u00b133%, 113-+15% and 175\u00b186%, respectively, compared to the results for 5.5 mm FWHM. This investigation demonstrates that not only static PET data, but also dynamic ones are dependent on the image resolution. As known from animal research (Schmidt et al., JCBM, 1991) , the high increase of k 4 might be caused by effects of tissue heterogeniety which become higher for lower resolution. We used 7mCi of 99m-Tc-MIBi iv. and imaged the neck from anterior (first: 16 frames of I s, secondly: 16 frames of I min, thirdly: static images up to 3 hrs). Evaluation was based upon visual interpretation and computer analysis; the functional state of the thyroid was characterized by Iodine-123 uptake and clearance. The initial perfusion was greater in hyperfunctional thyroid adenoma and parathyroid carcinoma than in parathyroid adenomas; it was inconspicuous in normal-and hypofunctional thyroid nodules.",

All pts were scanned 10 min., 1, 2, and 4 h after intravenous injection of 350 MBq 99Tc~\"-MIBI and digital scintigrams were acquired. The tracer kinetics was analyzed for the site of suspected parathyroidat adenoma (showing up as hot spot or known after surgery), the thyroid, and soft tissue of the neck. The activity of suspected lesions was compared with thyroidal activity and the ratio was found to increase with time for parathyroidal adenomas. 14 of the 31 pts, for whom histology is available, were diagnosed true positive. 3 of them were ectopic, intrathoracic in 1 case, autografts in the foreman in 2 cases. 2 findings were true negative, the remainder were false negative resulting in a sensitivity of app. 50 %. The scintigraphic finding for the 19 pts, who were not operated and who mostly were under dialysis, was negative and the final diagnosis most likely excluded an adenoma. None of the pts with hot or cold thyroidal nodules showed any lesion, that could be misinterpreted as a parathyroidal adenoma. The sensitivity of the method was found to be moderate in our unsetected patient population. However, the specificity is very high (no false positives in our study), as proven by histological comparison and in the prospective study with selected thyroidal disease. 111In-LDL has been shown to have preferable binding characteristics both in-vitro and in-vivo as compared to 99mTc and 123I.

To examine the short-and long-term renal effects on normal kidneys and circulating endothelin levels, we investigated renal perfusion and glomerular function after oral CyA and one month later. Study was performed on 18 patients (mean age: 28.7+14.3, range: 7-58 years) with diagnosis of psoriasis or alopecia (duration: 10.2+7.9) whose renal functions were normal. Renal function of pts were assessed using 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy. Following i.v. administration of 370 MBq 99mTe-DTPA, 64 serial images/per sec and 80 serial images/per 15 sec. were recorded. GFR was calculated according to the Gates' technique. Perfusion index (PI) was determined using Hilson's method. All patients received 5 mg/kg/day of CyA. Renal scintigraphy was pertormed at baseline, at 2rid hr following Cy A administration and after one month. Simultaneously blood levels of CyA (2 and 4 hrs after CyA administration), circulating endothelin, plasma and urine beta-2 microglobulin(B-2) were determined using RIA. The mean GFR was 81.4+16 ml/min (baseline). Following CyA, total GFR was decreased in 12 pts acutely, whereas it was increased in 4 and remained unchanged in 2 pts. CyA levels were 400.3+330 ng/rnl, 399.9+222 ng/ml and 269.77+320 ng/dl, respectively at 2nd, 4th hrs and one too. later. The mean endothelin level (10.6+7.8 pg/ml) was increased acutely (26.9+22 pg/ml). B-2 levels were within normal limits. The mean percent change of GFR (0.11+22, range: -38, +57,7) and mean percent change of P1(-4.97+36, range: -87.9, 87.2) were not correlated acutely with CyA, endothelin or B-2 levels. However, % change of endothelin at 2nd hour was significantly correlated with CyA !evel (p=0.02 r=0.78). One too. later, the mean GFR was changed to 74.4+21.2 ml/min, insignificantly. The mean % change of GFR (-6.6+25.2) was not correlated with CyA and B-2 levels. Our results indicated that CyA might cause an insignificant reduction of GFR in patients with normal kidneys being independently of CyA levels immediately after oral administration of drug and at long-term. Acute increase of endothelin correlated with CyA levels might be responsible for acute functional changes. ~he MTT and T20 in OBS is significantly longer than in FG (p<0.001). The IU in ATN, AR and OBS is significantly decreased in reference to FG (p<0.001 in ATN and AR; p<0.0S in OBS) . The IU in NTX is similar to FG and significantly different from ATN and AR. A significant correlation was found between serum creatinine and IU values (r=-0.74, p<0.01).Patients' IU follow up corresponded in most cases to clinical evolution. In conclusion, MTT, T20 and IU are useful in evaluating kidney allograft function and may be of help in the differential diagnosis of post-transplant renal disfunction. The intrarenal reflux plays the key role in the etiology of reflux nephropathy and its detection is of utmost importance in evaluating possible damage in kidney with reflux.",

Coronal, sagittal and transaxial slices (CST-slc) from SPECT Tc-ggm-DMSA allow a good detection of renal scarring but are not easy to read also because they are oblique as regards the longitudinal axis (LA) of the kidneys. The aims of this study were: i) to obtain slices parallel (PA-slcl and perpendicular (PE-slc) to the LA of each kidney and a cylindrical multi-slice diagram (MSD) ut each kidney; 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of both MSD and PA+PE-slc for the detection of renal scarring, in comparison with planar images (PI) and CST-slc. 26 patients (age range 1-71 yrs) were imaged 2 hours after administration of 80-200 MBq of Tc-ggm-DMSA. Planar and SPECT studies were performed. SPECT data were processed both in the usual fashion (to obtain CST-slc) and with a new algorithm. During reconstruction, the SPECT transaxial slices of each kidney were rotated to annihilate the angle between the LA and the sagittal plane. So PA-slc and PE-slc of each kidney were obtained. From each PE-slc a count distribution angular profile was obtained and represented as a horizontal row of pixels of a matrix (cylindrical MSD). The PI, the CST-slc, the PA+PE-slc and the MSD of each of the 5 2 kidneys were analyzed separately. Upper, central or lower part of each kidney was considered as a positive zone if it contained scars. The positive zones were 52, 70, 81 and i01 with the four techniques, respectively. 33 positive zones were always observed. Some more positive zones (not always the same) were reported with each technique: 19 on PI; 37 on CST-slc; 48 on PA+PE-slc and 68 on MSD. In conclusion SPECT PA+PE-slc and especially MSD were easier to read and allowed to find more renal scars than PI or CST-slc. Despite angiographically successful interventions, residual ischemia in the perfusion territory of the treated coronary artery is not uncommonly observed in postinterventional perfusion scintigrams. Intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS) studies have demonstrated that the extent of residual intracoronary plaque and obstruction may be underestimated by angiography. Therefore, 24 patients with angiographically successful (residual diameter steneses < 50%) coronary interventions (techniques: 14x PTCA, 6x stenting, 2x directional atherectomy, 2x rotablatien; vessels: 15x LAD, 7x RCA, 2x RCX) were examined by IVUS immediately after the intervention. 24 and 48 h after the intervention all patients underwent myocardial scintigraphy with 99m-Tc-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile after dipyridamole stress and at rest using a triple head SPECT camera. The perfusion territory of each treated vessel was estimated from the coronary angiogram and assigned to a segmental left ventricular model. Areas of myocardial ischemia were assigned to the same segmental model. The residual area stenosis was determined from IVUS images as (area within lamina elastica intema -luminal area) / area within lamina elastica interna. 13/24 patients had myocardial ischemia during dipyridamole MIBI-SPECT. Median area stenosis was 71% in patients with ischemia and 53 % in patients ivus stenosis_> 60% no yes without ischemia (p=.008; Mann-Whitney \" --yes I test). The best concordance between ~_m 2 11 residual area stenosis and residual g ~ no 8 3 ischemia was found for IVUS area stenoses _> 60%. Patients with stress induced myocardial ischemia immediately after successful coronary interventions show high grade residual stenoses when examined by IVUS which could at least partially explain the discrepancy between angiographic and scintigraphic findings.

Since MAG3 and hippurate are taken up even in ATN, they are unlikely to be sensitive markers of tubular injury. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of dynamic DMSA imaging, with measurement of renal extraction efficiency (EE) of DMSA, for the assessment of tubular injury. Renal blood now 0tBF) and DMSA EE were measured using quantitative techniques previously developed for DTPA. These were respectively based on the first-pass integration technique and the Patlak plot applied up to 15 min after injection. Since DMSA behaves almost as a pure intravascular marker, RBF can be obtained in units of ml/min. 24 patients were studied; 14 with native kidneys and 10 with recent transplants. As expected in this heterogeneous group, RBF was highly variable, with maximal values approaching 1000 ml/min in some transplants.The Patlak plot was consistently bi-phasic, giving a higher EE from 40 sec to 3 rain than over 3-15 rain. EE in both phases was consistently higher in native than in transplanted kidneys. In the first phase, it ranged from 1.5 to 7.3 and in the second, from 0.65 to 5.8. Five transplant recipients with biopsy documented ATN had low values of EE, 1.05 (sd 0.5) for the first and 0.28 (0.06) for the second phase, whereas in 5 with vascular and/or pareecbymal rejection, it was significantly higher, 2.35 (1.3; p<0.05), and 1.45 (1.0; p<0.05), respectively. The range of the second phase EE for the ATN group (0.2147.38) did net overlap with that for the rejection group (0.4-2.8), We conclude that dynamic DMSA imaging yields useful functional data, including RBF, and may be able to distinguish between rejection and causes of tubular damage, such as ATN or cyclosporin toxicity\u00b0 The timing of the initial higher EE is consistent with DMSA filtration; if 80% was protein-bound in plasma and filtration fraction was 20%, then EE over this phase would be 4%. The subsequent EE reflects tubular uptake. Coronary angiography is regarded as the gold standard in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, myocardia) perfusion scintigraphy is frequently regarded as false positive. Since the endothelium plays a pivotal role for coronary blood flow regulation, we tested the hypothesis that impairment of endothelium-dependent dilation of the microvasculature even in the absence of obstructive CAD could contribute to the failure of coronary blood flow to increase. In 16 patients (p) with normal perfusion and 14 p with exercise induced ischemia evaluated by TI-201 SPECT, coronary blood flow (CBF) was measured after infusion of the endothelium-dependent dilator (EDD) acetylcholine (ACh, 10 .8 to 10 .6 M), and of the smooth muscle relaxant papaverine (Pap, 7mg) into the LAD via a Doppler catheter. Flow-limiting epicardial CAD was excluded in all p. After ACh, CBF increases were significantly greater in all normal p compared to p with exercise induced TI-201 defects (ACh lOSM: 4 3 . 3 + 5 5 . 4 % vs 1 4 . 4 + 1 2 . 6 % NS, 10-7M: 1 1 9 . 8 + 5 9 . 5 % vs52_+39.8% p=O.O01, 10-6M: 173.8_+79.9% vs 7 2 . 8 + 2 8 . 5 % p=0.002). No difference was found after Pap: 360.6_+141.4 vs 3 4 2 + 7 6 . 6 % NS. The ACh/Pap-ratio was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in p with myocardial perfusion defects. Thus, impaired endothelium-dependent dilation of the coronary resistance vasculature contributes to exercise induced myocardial ischemia detected by TI-201 SPECT in p with nonobstructive CAD. ",

In order to ensure the finding \"ischaemia\", quantitative wash-out evaluation seems to be advautage0us~ Though, the value of the redistribution analysis for detection of ischemia after Dipy-stress has been judged differently. In order to prove the significance of the redistribution analysis thallium-SPECTmyocardial scintigraphy (MySc) after Dipy-stress wash-out was calculated in 48 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) verified by coronary angiography (CA). In 42 patients MySc was performed only after Dipy-stress and in 6 patients with a 14 day interval after both, Dipy-and ergo-stress. 0.75 mg/kg body mass dipyridamol and 74 MBq thallium-201 chloride were administered. The time interval between stress and redistribution scintigram was 3 hours, polar tomograms resulting from stress and redistribution scintigrams have been divided into 17 Regions of Interest (ROI). For the total 144 ROIs after Dipy-stress and additionally for 18 ROIs after ergo-stress wash-oat rates were calculated. The wash-out rates belonging to the 3 vascular regions of coronary blood supply were referred to the average value of the 2 ROIs with the highest wash-out values. Thereby, a reduction of the washout by more than 15 % compared to the maximum has been considered as pathological. Coronary stenoses of 60 % or more deemed to be relevant. In 113/144 (79 %) ROIs corresponding findings between CA data and washout calculation occured. In 31 ROIs discrepancies were found. Most of the different findings occurred in multi vessel CAD (13 cases with either 2 or 3 stenosed coronary arteries). In 8 cases, ROIs with discrepancies between CA and washout data were affected by a myocardial infarct. Comparing Dipy-and ergo-stress, 12 of the 18 ROIs agreed. In 4 ROIs with discrepancies Dipy-stress and in the other 2 ROIs with discrepancies ergo-stress were positive for ischaemia. Herewith, the Dipy and ergo scintigraphy were conform with the CA data in 3 times, respectively. Wash-out calculation of the MySc after Dipy-stress shows similar results as the redistribution analysis of the MySc with ergo-stress. The results indicate that also for MySc after Dipy-stress wash-out calculation makes the results more reliable and should, therefore, be added to the routine MySc evaluation.",

The axial field of view was 30 cm Iterative reconstruction was performed in eight iterations and images were reconstructed in three views. To avoid artefacts due to 18-FDG contamined urine 20 nag furosemide was given i.v. and the urinary bladder was purged continuously with an irrigation catheter. Results were compared to histological findings of intraoperativly picked lymph nodes. PET-scans were classified correctly positive, when a focally increased FDG-uptake was found in all correCt anatomical sites of verified infiltrated lymph nodes. Pet scans were classified as Correctly negative when activity distribution in small pelvis and lower abdomen showed no focally increased uptake in major lymphatic pathways and histology of lymph nodes was negative. In patients with bladder carcinoma lymph node staging was correctly negative in 7 patients, correctly positive in 3 patients and false positive in one patient. In patients with carcinoma of the kidney, lymph node staging was correctly negative in 7 patients and correctly positive in three patients. Despite renal excretion even the primary tumor was detectable in 4 out of 10 patients with kidney carcinoma.These preliminary results suggest that 18-FDG-PET provides a highly promising tool for demonstrating or excluding metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes in bladder-and kidney carcinoma.

Complications are alterations of blood pressure, brain pressure and cardiac output, lethargy, loss of cognitive functions and memory, and brain infarction as well. Aim of the study was (1) to find feasability of imaging rCBF during nocturnal phases of sleep apnea and (2) to document therapeutic effects of transnasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) breathing on rCBF. 13 patients ( 12 male, 1 female, mean age 50 +/-9.8 y, mean body weight 107+/-13.6 kg) were suspected to have SAS as indicated by a device for ambulant SAS monitoring (MESAM box) and were enrolled to the study. Polysomnography (PS) was started in the late evening hours. Patients were injected during a PS-documented apnea phase with 700 MBq Tc99m-HMPAO by rapid inflush of saline solution into i.v. indwelling cannula. Injection took place between 2.00 and 4.00 hrs a.m., SPECT data acquisition at 7.30 a.m. Two nights later the investigation was repeated under therapeutic transnasal CPAP breathing. Two injections coincided with REM phase. Injection times were doumented to allow for precise analysis of PS. All SPECT studies were evaluated by means of a semiquantitative algorithm and regional perfusion indices were established. Under CPAP breathing a drastic improvement of the former pathologic sleeping behaviour could be documented, the arterial pO 2 saturation increased (p<0.02), the apnea index decreased (p<0.01) significantly. More patients attained deeper states of sleep (from I and II to III and IV). In 5 patients a suprafrontal hyperperfusion, in two pat. an additional increased basal ganglia perfusion could be found, five pat. revealed temporo-parietal decreased perfusion pattern. All findings improved under CPAP, in two patients normalizing completely. SPECTs of the REM phase showed increased occipital perfusion in spite of closed eyes, revealing hyperactivity of visual cortex. We conclude that HMPAO-SPECT is capable to image nocturnal regional cerebral blood flow. Frontal hyperperfusion is discussed to have two reasons: dilatation of brain vessels due to increased pCO 2 tension with superposition of frontal cognitive activation during pathologic light sleep behaviour. A Tc-99m labelled antibody has been used in 14 p a t i e n t s for imaging r e c u r r e n t p r o s t a t i c malignancy. 600 MBq of Tc-99m labelled CYT-3SI (Cytogen Corporation, USA) was administered, with planar imaging at i0 minutes, 6 hours and 24 hours and pelvic SPET at 6 and 24 hours.",

We report on the first 11 cases who underwent an ictal and iuterictal rCBF SPECT so far. All patients received an EEG and a MILl of the brain including transverse protonand T2-weighted sequences, as well as coronal Tl-weighted IR-and T2-weighted TSE-sequences using a temporal angulation. Prior to injection the radiochemical purity of the tracer was determined to be at least 90% in all cases using thin layer chromatography. Approximately 590 -770 MBq 99mTc-Bicisate were i.v.-injected 2 -20 seconds (mean 5 sec.) after the onset of a seizure. SPECT-studies were started 1 to 3 hours after injection, using an annular crystal SPECT-system (Ceraspect, DSI). lnterictal studies were performed 30 minutes to 1 hour after i.v,-injectiot~ of 740 MBq 99mTc-Bicisate using the same SPECT-system. MR/ was normal iu 7/11 patients. During interictal phase 10/i1 patients showed areas of hypoperfusion according to the EEG findings. Ictal SPECT-studies revealed significant changes in perfusion iuvolveiug especially these areas in all patients. Circumscript areas of total hyperperfusion were detected in 5 patients. These preliminary results indicate that Bicisate is valuable for the assessment of epileptogenic foci, if the tracer injection is carried out rapidly after the onset of a seizure, which underlines the value of a tracer with a high in-vitro stability over several hours. In addition ictal rCBF SPECT using high resolution SPECT systems is able to detect circumscript ictal hyperperfusion suggested to represent the focus itself in a considerable number of patients. This study was performed in order to correlate ictal CBF changes to seizure symptomatology and to estimate the value of combined video -EEG and HMPAO -SPECT findings for the presurgical lateralisatlon of epileptogenic foci. In 15 patients (18 -65 yrs) prolonged video EEG recording (mean 5 days) and HMPAO -SPECT (Siemens Multispect 3) were obtained during a seizure (HMPAO inj. 40-60 sec after seizure onset). MRI and a second SPECT study were performed in the seizure free intervall. Nine patients had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) while 6 patients suffered from extra -temporal seizures (ETE). For anatomical reference SPECT studies were realigned and superimposed to MRI images. rCBF changes between the two SPECT studies were estimated visually and localized on MRI images. Loss of consciousness, postictal amnesia and automatisms were associated predominantly with activation of the lower mesial and lateral portion of the temporal lobe. Additional activation of the lateral frontal lobe was also seen in 3 patients with automatisms. Two patients with paranoid symptoms revealed increased HMPAO uptake in the mesio-and laterofrontal regions as well as in the anterior basal ganglia. One patient with TLE showed an activation in one temporal lobe and in the contralateral frontal and parietal region, suggesting no direct contralateral temporal seizure propagation, as already postulated by electrophysiological investigations in man. Optical hallucinations were paralleled by CBF increase in the temporal lobe, basal ganglia, sup. and inf. occipital lobe. During seizure activity elevated CBF extended from the extratemporal focus to the ipsilateral occipital and temporal lobe or even in both mesio -temporal regions in the ETE -group. One case with negative motor seizures had a circumscribed rCBF increase in the prefrontal cortex. Lateralisation of the epileptogenic focus was achieved by SPECT in 90%, EEG 60%, and MRI (hippocampal atrophy) in 70% of the cases. In summary, high resolution SPECT combined with prolonged EEG recording considerably increases the accuracy of focus lateralisation and the knowledge on seizure propagation related to seizure symptomatology.",

In all cases the PET-findings, a hypometabolic temporal area, correlated well with EEG-localization. In 4/7 patients we revealed a temporal memory deficit with a clear side classification, which correlated significantly with the EEG-and PET-lateralization of the epileptogenic area. In 2/7 cases there were bitemporal neuropsychological deficits. One neuropsychological test was rejected because of both-handing. These results demonstrate, that (1) noninvasive information about epileptogenic brain areas can be gained from 18FDG and PET.

The trial was terminated and radionuclide bone scans were performed on consenting participants. Bone scans suggested metabolic bone disease in only 1 of 17 patients on Regimen 1 (bone biopsy awaited) compared with 22 of 27 patients on Regimen 2. 16 bone biopsy results are available in Regimen 2 patients to date: 12 show evidence of osteomalacia. The high incidence of osteomalacia makes Regimen 2 an unsuitable treatment regimen. Bone scintigraphy is not routinely performed in osteoporotic patients but it played a vital role in this study in the identification of a serious adverse event. Aim of the study: Diabetic polyneuropathy leads to an alteration in bone perfusion by the opening of arterio-veneous shunts. A relationship between sympatholytic increased bone perfusion and diabetic osteopathy is discussed. Aim of the investigation is to show a possible correlation of bone density, examined by double-photon-absorptiometry (DPA) and the state of diabetic polyneuropathy. Performance: The study includes 60 diabetics and 30 control persons. Diabetic polyneuropathy was found in 30 diabetics. Exclusion criteria were neurological diseases of non-diabetic origin, osteological diseases as well as medications with an effect on the nervous system or on the bone turnover.

Due to the ill-posed nature of tomographie reconstruction, iterative methods cease to converge at a high number of iterations. Therefore, a priori information on the solution must be introduced (so called regularization) to assure the convergence.Various a priori can be used. Gibbs distributions are popular in image processing because they can model many different distributions. We choose one of them which assumes that all neighbouring pixels differences should be smoothed below a defined threshold and preserves above. This provides a regularization which preserved the discontinuities in the image. When regularized and in order to derivate the total energy term, the EM becomes a MAP-EM OSL (Maximum a posteriori-Expectation maximization one step late). ARTUR is an adaptative deterministic relaxation algorithm which relax the Poisson statistic. It models the photon counts by a Gaussian likelihood. We compared MAP-EM OSL and ARTUR, both using such a regularization on numerical and physical phantoms. Our data were acquired for different count rates and the numerical simulations were corrupted with Poisson noise. For the same image quality in terms of Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), at a number of counts in current use in clinical diagnoses, 60 iterations of 10 see were necessary with ARTUR and 250 iterations of 20 sec for the MAP-EM OSL. At a lower count rate the same result need 120 iterations for ARTUR and 250 iterations for the MAP-EM OSL. These results show that if the performances of both algorithms are equal, even at low count rates, computation time make a consequent difference in favour of ARTUR.",

Mid-sagittal plane localisation was done by a registration procedure where the left hemisphere is compared with the right hemisphere and vice versa.

A 3D segmentation procedure was applied to determine the brain contour. Activity normalisation was achieved by computing the modus of the ratio obtained by dividing the reference image data with the patient image.

Most clinical demonstrations with factor analysis of image sequences reported until today can be charaeterised as feasibility studies rather than rigorous clinical trials. Considering the complexity of diagnostic problems attempted to be solved by factor analysis~ it is surprising that basic quantitative dependences of extracted factors on the temporal and spatial sampling of input data are still not known. The aim of this study is to partially fill the ~ gap. Six high-frequency MAGS renal studies (300-400 images 64x64x2 recorded in 3-second intervals during 15-20 minutes in total) have been collected and analyzed using a workstation and an automatic procedure of factor analysis. Oblique rotation of factors was performed in the spatial domain and a Bayesian procedure used to automatically control the rotation. Using this method, the data have been analysed repeatedly while varying input conditions systematically in wide limits. The h~'pothesis was that the extracted factors (dynamic structures, compartments) should be invariant since the input data reflect the structure and function of real compartments inside the body sufficiently accurately. The parameters investigated were the time interval and region of interest to be used in the analysis, the effect of smoothing, the reduction in temporal and/or spatial sampling, and the number of factors. The results confirmed the hypothesis over a wide range of input parameters. When comparing the factor curves with the corresponding curves obtained from standard ROIs the main difference roland was that the factor curves approached zero at the same time when the factor structures lost their contrast against background. The conclusion is that the reproducibility of factors confirm both their usefulness in clinical studies and their p}rysiological meaning. Addi~ tional facts produced by the experiment help to understand the interpretation of factors~ predict their ap~ pearance, and formulate more accurate advice for users.

OP was diagnosed in 193 women (56.6Z) and 105 men (33.7%) and the prevalence was parallel to the age of subjects in both sexes. Serum GLA was significantly higher in women than in men (3.7\u00b11.9 ng/ml vs 3.3\u00b11.6 ng/ml, p<0.005). Women with OP had slightly higher GLA than women without OP (3.8\u00b11.8 ng/ml vs 3.5\u00b12 ng/ml, n.s.) but in the subgroup of women in perimenopausal period (45-55 yrs) GLA was significantly higher in women with OP than without 'OP (p<005). The latter was similar in men: GLA was elevated in men with OP when compared without OP (3.7\u00b11.8 ng/ml vs 3.1\u00b11.5 ng/ml, p<0.005).",

Although calyeeal dilatation was the most common finding when only 1 positive crlterium was present, it was not the most frequent when the whole group was considered. We conclude that US, besides having an already known low sensitivity in detecting RS, does not even have a reliable pattern of findings that allows the establishment of levels of suspicion. Renal DMSA scan in only 1 projection (posterior) was still far better than US (77% of ItS detected). The introduction of new mefi~ods for biochemical parameters of bone related processes necessitates reevaluation of the diagnostic regimen in bone metastases. We present a study initiated by the question whether the new radioimmanological test for bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) yields additional or more adequate information than routine bone scintigraphy in patients with breast or prostatic cancer. For 130 post-operative patients (95 breast and 35 prostatic cancer) the results of two different methods for the determination of BAP were compared: photometric determination after wheat germ precipitation (Boehtinger Mannheim) and two site immunoradiometric assay COstase\", Hybritech). Bone scans were recorded simultaneously (99mTc-HlvlDP, whole body scanning, anterior and posterior ,dev,,s, Siemens-Bodyscan). Patients with bone lesions were X rayed and followed-up for one year. Results: 62 patients were free of any scintigraphic lesions, 29 had increased focal activity accumulation caused by degenerative processes and 39 patients had lesions caused by. solitary or multiple metastases. The information content of the biochemical tests was determined using ROC diagrams. With a 90 % specificity both tests had a sensitivity of 60 %. The results of both determinations showed a significant correlation (r = 0.85, p< 0,01). The optimal threshold for differentiating patients with and without metastatic disease was found to be 25 ng/ml for the immanoradiomemc assay. We conclude that both methods of BAP determination provide similar results and that neither method offers the potential to substitute bone scintigrapby in primary diagnosis of metastatic disease, due to limited accuracy. The role in therapy remains to be defined. ",

Infants less than 24 months old are a special interest group due to a higher probability of kidney damage during an urinary tract infection, and to a relatively high incidence of APN. This study tries to increase our knowledge about the evolution of the acute pyelonephritis in these young children. DMSA scans performed in 29 children during the APN and 12 months after have been analyzed (persistence, improvement or normalization of the hypoactive area(s), variation in differential function, grade of vesico-ureteric reflux). Experimental partial ureteral obstruction can lead to reduced GFR in the weeks following surgery, the intensity of this reduction being dependent on the severity of the stenosis. After this transitory period, the function remains stable, suggesting that patients with congenital hydronephrosis (HN) are not at high risk of further degradation of the function. Similarly, it is logical to think that a preserved function, in a patient with congenital HN, is not suggestive for marked obstruction and one might therefore expect a good renal emptying after furosemide.The aim of the present work was to evaluate if a normal GFR on the site of the affected kidney can predict a good response to furosemide.",

In patients with inferior AMI an additional perfusien defect in the noninfarcted anterior wall yields the highest predictive accuracy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT in the detection of jeopardized myocardium early after acute myocardial infarction, Coronary arteriography and myocardial scintigraphy were performed early after myocardial infarction in 41 consecutive patients with an unco~olieated myocardial infarction. Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT was performed both at rest and after IV adenosine infusion (140 ~g/kg/min during 6 min, in 40 ml saline). The SPECT-images were analyzed semiquantitatively using a 17 segment model. A reversible perfusion defect in the infarct region occured in 23 patients (56 %) and was almost solely observed in the presence of jeopardized myocardium [Myocardium was considered jeopardized if the successfully reperfused infarct region was supplied by a residual significant coronary artery stenosis (> 50 %). Jeopardized myocardium was present in 24 (58 %) patients]. Adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi sPECT had a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88% and a accuracy of 88% for the detection of jeopardized myocardium. Adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT correctly identified 100% (20/20) of patients with single vessel disease, and 75% (12/16) of patients with multivessel disease. These results suggest that adenosine Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT is a fairly accurate non-invasive method for detecting jeopardized myocardium and may be a valuable non-invasive test for the early selection of high risk patients surviving acute myocardial infarction.

All patients received thrombolytic therapy within 4 hrs after onset of symptoms. Coronary angiography was performed at 90 rain and at 5 days. Only pts with a TIMI-3 grade patency at 90 minutes were selected. Patients underwent a control flow (N-13 NH3) and metabolic (F-18 FDG) study 5 days and 3 months later. In 8 out of 11 pts, only a moderate decrease of BF was found initially (71+8 ml/min/100g) of whom 5 showed preservation of BF (73+9 ml/min/100g) and metabolism during follow-up, in 1 patient PTCA was performed because of a mismatch pattern at 5 days resulting in improvement of BF and metabolism. In 2 pts, a decrease of BF (35+9 ml/min/100g) and metabolism was found at 5 days of whom 1 showed reocclusion. On the contrary, in 3 out of 11 pts, a severe reduction of BF (31+7 ml/min/100g) was present in the acute stage although the infarct related coronary artery was patent. Control studies in 2 of those 3 pts showed persistently reduced BF (32+6 ml/min/100g) and metabolism compatible with necrosis. Having a mismatch pattern at 5 days, and a critical stenosis, the third patient underwent a PTCA resulting in a restoration of BF (69 ml/min/100g) and metabolism measured after 3 months. We conclude that persistent flow after thrombolytic therapy, as shown by acute coronary angiography, is not always associated with optimal tissue perfusion. In patients showing 'no reflow' at 24 hrs, flow/metabolic PET studies are helpful to identify viable tissue. Tomoscintigraphy of myocardial parenchyma is highly sensitive but poorly specific as to the detection of infarction.

After reconstruction with a Butterworth filter (8/0.34) an attenuation correction using the CHANG-algorithm was performed. Coronal scans were obtained after reconstruction and the slice containing the count maximum of the pituitary gland was selected. A \"pituitary uptake index\" was built from the ratio of the count maximum in the pituitary gland and neighbouring skull bone at 4 and 24 h p.i. The results show an increase of the uptake index from 4 to 24 h in the adenomas and also in the reference group. This increase was 2-3 times higher as an average for the adenomas and shows the stronger binding and density of receptors in adenomas. Of course a clear seperation from the reference group was only possible for adenomas greater than 15 mm in diameter. These results suggest that a estimation of the \"pituitary uptake index\" could be a useful parameter for receptor density and might be a possibility to predict clinical response on octreotide treatment.

The clinical role of SPET in the evaluation of brain perfusion (BP) is well established, while the significance of abnormal visualization of intracranial vessels with MRA has to be assessed. The aim of the study was to correlate the appearance of intracranial arteries at MRA with SPET images in 24 patients with BP abnormalities indicative of cerebrovascular disease (CVD). SPET studies were performed after i.v. injection of 740 MBq 99mTc-HMPAO using a high-resolution system (CERASPECT, DSI). The presence of either focal or diffuse cortical perfusion defects or of marked left-right asymmetry were considered abnormal findings at SPET. A conventional MR brain scan (1.5 Tesla, Magnetom, Siemens) was followed by the acquisition of 3D-tirne-of-flight MRA sequences for the study of intracranial arteries (TR=36-43 msec, TE=6-8 msec, Flip angle=15\u00b0). MRA studies were considered abnormal if major intraeranial arteries showed narrowing or reducedabsent signal, or if their peripheral branches had decreased visualization. SPET and MRA abnormalities were concordant in 12 cases. MRA was rated normal in 5 patients with focal BP defects and/or marked asymmetry, and in 5 patients with globally decreased cortical perfusion. In the remaining 2 patients with frontal and fronto-parietal BP defects, reduced visualization of peripheral cerebral vessels were observed in the contralateral hemisphere. MRA documented the \"anatomic\" correlation to the BP abnormalities in 50% of the cases; on the other hand, several factors may modify blood delivery to the parenchyma independently from the status of feeding arteries, and this could justify the findings in the other patients. MRA seems able to provide useful complementary anatomic information in the diagnostic work-up of patients with CVD, with little extra scan time after a conventional MR brain scan. In order to obtain a data base for activation studies, the normal values and the reproducibility of Tc-g9m HMPAO regional cerebral uptake measurements were assessed in 16 young healthy volunteers. I f studies were repeated in identical conditions within 72 hours. All studies were processed by two observers unaware of each others results. Five minutes after the injection of 20 mCi Tc-99m HMPAO, a SPECT acquisition, 64 steps of 30 sec over 360% was started on a 3head Multispect Siemens gamma camera (192 images). After backprojection using a Butterworth filter (cutoff 0.5), Chang's attenuation correction and, reorientation according to the orbito-meatal line, 5 transverse 14 mm thick slices were defined: the lowest slice containing the cerebellum and temporal lobes, the second through the basal ganglia and thalamus and, 3 consecutive cortical slices. A threshold of 50% was used in the lowest 2 slices for manual delineation of the regions, according to a cerebral atlas, (5 and 6 mirrored regions respectively); a threshold of 65% was used for the automatic sectorisation in the upper 3 slices (6 mirrored regions in each slice). Thus 58 (2x29) vascular ROIs were defined over transverse slices in each volunteer. All regions were normalized to the maximal cerebellar activity.",

No difference was seen between normal and total occluded arteries, suggesting adequate collateral blood supply. Lack of difference between normals and non significant stenoses can indicate the clinical non significance of these stenoses, Further studies should be performed to relate the CPR will risk reduction for CVA's in the follow up of these patients. The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the haemodynamic significance of asymptomatic cerebral embolism in patients undergoing carotid endartectomy (CEA). In a series of 22 patients (two patients had both sides operated sequentially), MRI revealed small single or multiple emboli after five CEAs. Cerebral perfusion reserve (CPR) was measured just before and one month after CEA by performing Tc-99m-HMPAO SPET both before and after intravenous injection acetazolamide (dose I g). CPR was calculated for the whole 10.5 mm thick transverse slice as well as for the symmetrical ipsi-and contralateral ROIs representing the affected embolic and contralateral areas. Before CEA, regional ipsi-and contralateral CPRs were symmetrical (5 vs ii %, ns). After CEA, ipsilateral CPR decreased to -3 %. The contralateral CPR remained unchanged (8 %), and it was significantly higher than on the ipsilateral side after CEA (p<0.05). The CPR for the whole slice showed a slight decrease (13 % vs 3 %, ns). These preliminary findings suggest that asymptomatic cerebral embolism during CEA decreases ipsilateral regional vascular reactivity. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) can be cured by surgical derivation but morbidity of such treatment is high indeed. Iterative lumbar puncture can induce clinical and cerebral blood flow improvement, Chronic treatment with acetazolamide (0,5 g per day) can also improve clinical status after a few weeks (1, 2). We undertook to measure brain perfusion by 99mTc HMPAO SPECT (740 MBq) before and after 4 to 6 week-treatment with acetazolamide in 5 patients (age 42 to 86 years). All patients demonstrated ventricular enlargment on CT, and were suffering from gait and walking disturbances and anterograde amnesia. Their clinical status was assessed by a Mini Mental Test (3MT) and a Hachinski Test. SPECT demonstrated a decreased regional blood flow in hippocampal areas, in frontal and white matter parietal cortex. Acetazolamide treatment was effective in 4/5 patients, with 3MT improvement, even normalization in 2/5. The nonresponding patient (42 years) had a non communicating congenital hydrocephalus. Accordingly, brain perfusion assessed quantitatively with a standard dose was dramatically improved (range 20 to 75%) in all patients with clinical improvement (4/5). The patient not clinically improved did not demonstrate any brain perfusion increase after acetazolamide. We concluded that 99mTc HMPAO brain SPECT may be a non invasive and objective imaging procedure to assess acetazolamide efficiency in patients suffering from NPH, matching well with clinical status, A on going expertise is done on a cohort of 9 patients with the same protocol to assess regional increase of flow in psychiatric improved patients after DIAMOX.",

To predict the tolerance of permanent ICA resection, a balloon test occlusion is recommended. The procedure is commonly combined with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT and recently also sensitized with acetazolamide. The aim of our study was to determine the quantitative criteria of pathological rCBF patterns in this test. In 17 patients with oropharyngeal tumours, a balloon test occlusion with acetazolamide (1 g) (stress study) combined with a high resolution SPECT (CERASPECT) and 99mTc-HMPAO were performed besides continuous clinical and transcranial Doppler sonographical (TCD) monitoring.. In 8 cases the rCBF SPECT was repeated under resting condition. The patients in groups with normal and pathological reaction were categorized according to the clinical signs and symptoms, the TCD findings and the postoperative outcome. The rCBF SPECT data with an automatic ROI method were analysed. The asymmetry of 99mTc-HMPAO uptake in percent and its changes compared to the rest study were determined at the global cortex, the medial cerebral artery (MCA) territory, and the watershed zones. The rCBF SPECT asymmetry values of the cortex, and of the watershed zone showed a statistically significant correlation with the TCD results (0.67, p<0.01 and 0.62, p<0.01 respectively, Spearman rank correlation), but not with the MCA territory. In the group of patients with normal reaction (n=11) during the test occlusion the side difference on SPECT was 5+2% in the cortex, 8+5% at the MCA region, and 9_+6% in the watershed zone. The corresponding data for the changes between rest and stress condition (n=5) were 2_+2, 2_+2, and 2_+3, respectively. In the differentiation between normal and pathological reactions, a threshold value of 15% in the watershed zone at the stress study gave a sensitivity of 5/6, and a specificity of 11/11. We concluded': 1. Quantitative analyses of rCBF SPECT data give objective criteria in the interpretation of ICA occlusion tests with acetazolamide. 2. The rCBF alterations in the watershed zones seem to be especially valuable. 3. In the suspicion of anamnestic rCBF disturbances rCBF SPECT under rest condition is also needed.

So intralesional RIT could be successfully applied after surgical and radiotherapy treatment of primary Clinical data of 37 1-131 MIBG treatments were reevaluated with the question whether the application of a therapeutic standard activity -which is easier to handle -is preferable or an individual activity based on a pretherapeutic dosimetry is mandatory. The goal of pretherapeutic dosimetry was to keep the whole body dose below 1 Gy per treatment. Treatments were devided into 2 groups: Group 1 (n=8) receiving tumor doses of more than 50 Gy per treatment (high tumor dose, HTD) and group 2 (n=29) with tumor doses below 50 Gy (low tumor dose, LTD). The aim was to clarify whether the tumor doses and side effects correlate with the whole body doses. Medians were calculated and U-tests were applied. A p-value < 0.05 was assumed to be significant.Whole body doses of the HTD group and LTD group were not significantly different (0.5 Gy resp. 0.55Gy). There was a not significantly Ngher 24 h uptake of MIBG under therapy by the HTD group (34 vs. 29%) although, according to the selection of groups, tumor doses of the HTD group were significantly higher than in the LTD group (62.5 Gy vs. 16 Gy). We observed only a trend towards a longer survival of the HTD group (9.5 vs. 7.5 months), however, the cured child and the child with the longest survival (> 8 yaers) belonged to the HTD group. Tumor marker responses (VMA, HVA) did not differ between the groups. The immediate toxic bone marrow response based on leucocyte and thrombocyte counts was comparable for both groups. Despite a low tumor uptake a long remission of more than 24 months was achieved in 1 child. 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is associated with a reduction in the circulating platelets,thrombocytopenia being the major factor limiting the therapeutic application of a 13tI-MIBG therapy.In order to assess the potencial radiation hazard, we therefore investigated the platelet uptake mechanism of 131I-MJBG in-vitro and in-vivo. The influence of plateletdensity, temperature and time of incubation and amount of radioactivity were analysed as well as the effect of iv administration of 131I-M~G for diagnosing on platelet count, viability and blood cell uptake invivo.Venous blood from healthy volunteers (n=182) and patients with (n =17) and without(n=9) g-blockers was studied.In-vitro studies included varying conditions: plateIet-density (1.107, 1.10 s, 1.109 platelets/ml), temperature of incubation (4\u00b0C, 22\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C), time of incubation (5, 10, 30, 60 rain) and amount of radioactivity (0.01, 0.1, 1 uCi). When bacreasing the number of platelets a progressively higher cellular uptake was found. This uptake was temperature -and time -dependent, while it was not influenced by inereasig amounts of radioactivity. No difference in platelet uptake between volunteers and patients without 13blockers was found, while platelets derived from patients under 13blockers did not show that selective uptake. After a diagnostic application of 500 uCi 131I-MIBG In-vivo a selective uptake by platelets occurred too, resulting in a platelet to plasma ratio of up to 1:32. Even at~er a diagnostic dose a nadir of platelet count down up to 36% (maximum at 7 days) was observed. Patients under B-blockers did not show a change in their platelet count, the platelet plasma ratio did not exceed l:4.4.These in-vitro and in-vivo findings suggest that 131I-MIBG is actively taken up by blood platelets by a mechanism being dependent on the concentration of platelets, the temperature and the time, which is inibited by B-blockers. This selective uptake may explain the major irradiation hazard of 13II-MIBG.",

Our study was performed in order to evaluate the sensitivity of NIIn-P in 17 pts with histology-proven lymphoma, including 4 pts with Hodgkin's (HL, 4 studies) and 13 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: 5 low-grade (1NHL, 7 studies), 2 intermediate-grade (iNHL, 3 studies) and 6 high-grade (hNHL, 8 studies). Planar (4h, 24h) and SPECT (24h) acquisitions were performed after injection of-200MBq tHIn-P. The scintigraphic findings were compared with conventional imaging modalities (CIM) and histology when available. mIn-P was +ve in 7 new cases, 3 recurrences and 5 residual diseases. One of 2 refractory pts was mIn-P +ve (iNHL) whereas the other was -ve (1NHL). mIn-P was -ve in 4 of the 5 complete remissions whereas in 1 pt a stable lymph node remained +ve aider radiotherapy. mIn-P detected 21 of the 28 lesions recognized by CIM: the sensitivity per lesion was 100%, 78%, 80% and 64%, in HL, hNHL, iNHL and 1NHL respectively. The -ve sites included 2 lymph nodes, 1 spleen infiltration, 1 liver, 1 bone and 1 meninges lesion, mIn-P detected 9 unsuspected lesions: 1 true +ve, 5 unconfirmed and 3 false +ve (2 infectious sites, 1 external contamination). Nine of the 11 biopsied lesions (9 pts) were ~In-P +ve (82%). In all but 2 pts (2 INHL), mIn-P and CIM resulted in an identical pt staging. Conclusions: t) our results indicate the potential usefulness of ~In-P for staging of lymphomas, particularly in HL patients, 2) data interpretation should be cautious in patients with potential infectious complications.

In conclusion:problem-oriented use of BMS using antigranulooyte antibody is indicated in patients with malignant lymphomas. Weightlessness induces changes on blood cells, body fluids and electrolytes which can be simulated by head-down-tilt studies (HDT). Sodium (Na) intake might be responsible for some changes. We investigated 12 healthy volunteers with 4 MBq 51Cr in-vitro labeled red blood cells (RBC). Governmental permission was obtained. Group I (GI, n=6) was evaluated with 10 days 6 \u00b0 HDT with strict diet control. Group II (GII, n=6) was investigated with increasing Na intake (three 8 days periods: 2.8 -> 5.6 -> 8.4 mmol Na/kg BW). Half-life of RBC (T1/2RBC) was calculated by using 5~Cr counts (CrC) of blood samples (BS). To calculate blood volume (BV) the CrCs were corrected by the T1/2RBC, the total volume of BS, T1/2 of 51Cr and an activity loss of the RBCs of 2%/day. Plasma (PV)-and RBC-volume (RBCV) was then calculated by using the hematocrit. In GI Na loss of 80 mmol was observed during the first days of HDT and Na retention during recovery. PV was reduced by 16% and returned to normal during recovery whereas RBCV remained constant. TI/2RBC was slightly reduced (p <0.4). In GII Na-and urodilatin (natriuretic peptide)-excretion increased with increasing levels of Na intake (p < 0.006) whereas urine flow remained unaffected. BV increased linearily with Na intake resulting in a raise of maximally 0.6 1 __ 0.13 1 (p < 0,05). This was accompanied by a decrease in vasopressin, and renin-aldosteron levels. The metabolic Na balance revealed a Na storage without changes in serum Na concentration and -osmolality. T1/2RBC decreased significantly by 7.5 days (p < 0.05). We conclude, that microgravity and Na intake significantly affects the composition of body fluids and cells which can be accurately measured by the S~Cr-method and urodilatin appears to contribute to the day-to-day Na balance.",

Nucl. Med. 1989, 30: 110-112; Langen et al., J. Nucl. Med. 1990 , 31: 281-286, and ibid. 1991 , 32: 1225 -1228 . However, the brain uptake of IMT is poor, and only allows the visualization of increased rather than decreased incorporation. We have therefore prepared and evaluated O-methylated radioiodinated tyrosines in order to increase their lipophilicities. Direct eleetrophilic n.e.a, radioiodination of the anisol-like aromatic moieties using the well known Chloramine-T (CAT) method resulted in unsatisfactory yields. Using tfifluoroacetic acid (TFA) containing 10 vol.% water as a reaction solvent radiochemical yields of 40% of 3-[123I]Iodo-O-methyl-L-tyrosine (IOMT) and 3-[I23I]Iodo-O-metbyl-L-~-methyltyrosine (IOMMT) could be obtained at 60\u00b0C in 5 rain reaction time. Use of Iodo-gen TM as an oxidant instead of CAT gave rise to RCY of 60% at 60\u00b0C in 45 rain reaction time. In contrast to the normally used two phase system Iodo-gen~/water our labelling reactions were performed in a homogeneous medium. IMT can be obtained in RCY's of 80% in 10 rain at RT using Iodogen TM in the normal aqeous two phase system at pH=8. Biodistribution studies with NMRI mice revealed a maximal brain uptake of the compounds that parallels their lipophilicities: IMT<IOMT<IOMMT. IOMMT exhibits a maximum brain uptake of 5% dose/g at 1O rain p.i.. This is by a factor of 5 higher than that of 1MT used so far. In vivo deiodination of the O-methyiated tyrosines is significantly inhibited and can be neglected. Thus, IOMMT seems to be a useful tracer for studying amino acid transport in brain with SPET. Recently 14-[F-lg]Fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid has been proven to be a metabolically trapped fatty acid (DeGrade et ah, JNM 32:1888 [1991 ) suitable for myocardial PET investigations. A phenylene-bridged LCFA (13-(p-[l-123] iedophcnyl)-3-(p-phenylene)-tridecanoic acid, ([I-123]-PHIPA 3-10) which is trapped in the myocardium has been reported (Eisenhut et al. ARI 39:639 [1988] ). In the current study we compared the influence of Etomoxir as a specific inhibitor of palmitoyl-carmtine-transferase I (CPT 1) on the biodistribution of [I-123]-PHIPA 3-10 in animals. In humans, basic biokinefic data were determined in volunteers.",

Within a series of halogenated derivatives of 4-amino-N-[1- [3-(4fluorophenoxy) propyl]-4-methyl-4-piperidinyl]-5-halo-2-methoxybenzamide, a new class of potential 5HT2 antagonists, it was shown that the 5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide analogue showed a high affinity (Ki for inhibition of [3H]ketanserin binding to rat frontal cortex membranes 0.22 nM) and high selectivity for 5HT~receptors (selectivity with regard to other neurotransmitter receptorsites of at least a factor 50). Therefore the pure N.C.A. radioiodinated analogue was synthetised and evaluated in vitro and in vivo in rats. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding to rat frontal cortex membranes of the 1-125 labelled compound revealed a linear plot yielding a Kd of 0.11 + 0.01 nM and a Bmax value of 37.79 +_ 0.75 fmol/mg tissue. The binding occured reversibly on one single type of receptor, i.e. 5HT2. From 1 hour up to 3 hours after i.v. injection into the tail vain of rats the frontal cortex to cerebellum ratio showed a steady state value of about 8-9 and the frontal cortex to blood ratio a value of 5 6. The striatum/cerebellum and striatum/blood amounted to about half that value. Inhibition and displacement by Ritanserin and Ketanserin showed that binding to 5HT 2 receptors was involved. Two hours after injection the %ID/g in frontal cortex was 0.24 and in striatum was 0.12 while in the total brain (frontal cortex and striatum included) this value amounts to 0.087 which means a ratio of at least 3 for frontal cortex and 2 for the striatum versus the rest of the brain. These results show that, if the behavior in human will be comparable, this new compound is really promising for visualisation of 5HT2 receptors with SPET.",

Age was 52\u00b113 years, 30 pts were men, 13 pts were in Class I / I I and 18 pts in Class I l l / I V . 15 pts had dilated cardiomyopathy, 12 ischemic cardiomyopathy and 4 pts valvular heart disease.

Mean H/M in CHF pts was 1,40\u00b10,24; there were not differences between ischemic, dilated and valvular disease and between Class 1/11 and I l l / I V pts. H/M showed a significant correlation with EF (r=0,53, p<O,01) but not with RA, PA and PCWP pressures. All pts were followed up for a mean period 9,1\u00b14,3 months (range 2-16 months),1 pt was transplanted (excluded from further analysis) and 6 pts died. From the remaining alive pts, 12 pts improved in NYHA Class,2 pts deteriorated and the remaining were stable during follow--up.

Recent investigations have shown that Tc-99m-SestaMIBI could be used to image several tumours. Aim of the study was to evaluate clinical usefulness of Tc-99m-SestaMIBI SPET in imaging brain tumours and differentiating between local relapse and necrosis. Based on clinical and radiological (CT or MR scan) suspicion of relapse of brain tumours after surgery, ehemo and radiotherapy, 30 patients (M/F = 20/10; age range = 18-70 years) were enrolled in this study. SPET was performed 1 hour after i.v. injection of 20 mCi of Tc-99m-SestaMIBI. The acquisitions were executed with a Toshiba GCA-901A on a 64*64 matrix, zoom = 1.5, 30 sec/proj, 60 steps over 360*. Results were compared with clinical status and radiological findings during the follow-up. SPET resulted positive in 24/30 pts: 7/8 glioblastomas, 8/10 astrocytomas, 1/2 oligodendrogliomas, i/i gliosarcoma, i/I meningioma, 1/2 medulloblastomas, 0/I pinealoblastoma, 0/i chordoma, i/i melanoma, 3/3 metastatic ca. In 6 cases SPET showed no pathological uptake. Choroidal plexuses were visualized in all patients. After a mean follow-up time of 6 months, these findings appear as follows: 18 TP; 3 TN; 1 FP; 4 FN. The remaining 4 pts are still under observation. We are also correlating tumour uptake with histological grading. In conclusion, Tc-99m-SestaMIBI seems to be a promising tracer for brain imaging, to distinguish between tumor relapse and radionecrosis. ",

Quantitation of the protein synthesis rate (PSR) is possible with the tracer L-l-[HC]-tyrosine (TYR). Here we report the first results with TYR in patients with brain tumours, including the response to therapy. Sixteen patients with a suspected primary or recurrent brain tumour were studied. Patients received 370 MBq TYR i.v. A dynamic protocol was used and arterial blood samples were taken for measurement of the input function and the assessment of metabolites. PSR was calculated using a modified Patlak-analysis. Two of the patients underwent a second TYR-PET shortly after the end of radiotherapy. Histology showed: astrocytoma (n=5), oligodendroglioma (n=2), glioblastoma (n=4), metastasis (n=l), meningioma (n=l), vasculitis (n=l). No histological confirmation was obtained in 2 patients: 1 with a positive signal on TYR-PET, 1 with a negative signal. All turnouts gave a positive signal. The PSR varied between 0.68 and 2.05 nmol/ml/min in the tumours and between 0.42 and 1.64 nmol/ml/min in the contralateral hemisphere. Tumor to background ratio was 1.64_+0.46. In 2 patients an -unexplained-low PSR was found (tumour: 0.15 and 0.17, hemisphere: 0.12 and 0.07). The vasculitis patient had a PSR of 0.82 in the lesion, while the meningioma did not show up on the scan. Both patients that were studied after radiotherapy too showed no respons in the PSR, indicating no effect on tumour metabolism. 1H-spectroscopy and clinical symptoms pointed towards similar findings. In conclusion: TYR is a useful diagnostic tool for the visualisation of brain tumours. The possibility of calculating a PSR allows the use of TYR-PET in the evaluation of radiotherapy. PET (amino acids, FDG) has been successful in differentiating between recurrence, radiation necrosis and oedema in brain tumours. This was confirmed in a comparative study with 123I_a.IMT.SPECT. It was the aim of this study evaluate the grade of malignancy and to assess the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of IMT-SPECT in the follow up of patients after surgery and intra operative radiotherapy (IORT). 52 patients with suspected brain tumours (13 controls, 3 metastases, 36 gliomas [histopathology grading: low grade II: 6; high grade II-III,Ilh 17, Ill-IV,IV: 13]) (age 2-59 y) were additionally characterized by morphologically oriented methods (MRI/CT) and functional imaging (99mTc-HMPAO; 123I-IMT; three headed-SPECT-system, SIEMENS Gammasonics; LEUHR). The scans were visually compared and evaluated by ROIs and T/NT-ratios. 14 patients were followed (up to 3 x) by SPECT imaging after IORT.",

This study focuses on the release of Tc-99m from Tc-99m-hlgG in infectious fool, comparing two different Tc-99m-hlgG preparations with In-111-hlgG. Tc-99m-labeled nicotinyl hydrazino hlgG (Johnson Matthey, JM) and Tc-99m-labeled 2-iminothiolane-modified hlgG (Mallinckrodt Diagnostica, MD) were both labeled with C-14 by methytation, using C-14formaldehyde, and pudfied by gel filtration. DTPA-conjugated hlgG was labeled with In-111 by citrate transchelation and used as such. HPLC was performed as quality control. Young Wistar rats with a S. Aureus infection of the left calf muscle were i.v. injected with either 6 MBq Tc-99m and 40 KBq C-14 labeled to 130 or 50 pg hlgG (JM resp. MD) or 2 MBq In-1tl labeled to 80 ~ hlgG. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 6, or 24 hr p.i. Averages \u00b1 SD in=5) of percentages of dose per gram (%lD/g) were determined for plasma, udne, abscess, and vadous other tissues. Plasma and udne samples were analyzed by HPLC. The radiochemical pudty was > 96%. Tc-99m-hlgG (JM) was better retained in abscesses and had a slower plasma clearance than both Tc-99m-hlgG (MD) and ln-111-hlgG (24 hr p.L %lD/g abscess: JM: 1.48; ME): .84; In: 1.10; p<0.01; plasma: 3.24 resp. 1.69 and 1.28; p<0.01; abscess/muscle: 9.0 resp. 6.5 and 6.3). In abscesses the Tc-99m1C-14 ratio increased over time. The renal uptake of Tc-99m-hlgG (JM) at 24 hr p.i. was lower than for both other agents (%ID/g kidney: JM: 1.45; MD: 5.07; In: 4.57; p<0.01). In plasma a small quantity of only one Tc-99m-labeled metabolite was found with a higher molecular weight than hlgG. In conclusion: Tc-99m-labeled nicotinyl hydrazino hlgG (JM) seems an attractive agent for localization of infections. As In-1tl, Tc-99m is retained in infectious foci, whereas IgG or its metabolites are released. Tuftsin, a tetrapeptide derived from the Fc portion of !gG, promotes phagocytosis and chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocyte/ macrophages by a receptor-mediated mechanism. Given the uniqueness of the receptor for these cells, we have attempted to use tuftsin antagonist(TKPPR) as a targeting moiety for inflammation imaging.",

Blood specimens (5 ml ) were drawn 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min, 4h and 24h postinjection for calculation of the recovery rate of the antibody in whole blood. After isolation of pure granutocytes on a PERCOLL/plasma gradient, the antibody distribution in the gradient was imaged with a gamma camera and calculated by ROI-technique. Whole body scans I h ,4h and 24h p.L in anterior and posterior projections were performed to calculate whole body distribution. The recovery rate of the fragment in whole blood was 38.8% (5min), 24,4%(lh), 12.2%(4h) and 3,2%(24h). The recovery rate for the cell associated Tc-99m-fragment was 4%-6%(5min-60min). In-vivo infectious lesions could already be detected 1 h post injection. These results prove the low antibody binding to circulating granulocytes and a high in-vivo availability of the unbound antibody. In summary, this high in-vivo availabiltiy of the unbound Fab'fragment seems to aIIow a binding of the fragment lh p.i. to granulocytes in the loci and imaging of an infection independent from leucocyte migration. The diagnostic accuracy for imaging infection of a Tc-99m-label led antigranulocyte Fab'-fragment(NCA-90;IMMU-MN3) was prospectively examined in a multicenter study. Scintigraphy was performed in 53 patients(27m; 26f;age: 26-86 years) between 1-6 h and 24h p.i. after injection of 0.1-1.00 mg of antibody fragment labeled with 166-1036 MBq of Tc-99m In total, 39 infectious lesions were detected with histology, cytology, other imaging procedures, or by follow-up.38 patients were additionally examined with Tc-99m-HMPAO or In-111oxin labelled granulocytes within of one week of the MN3 study. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of Tc-99m-MN3 was 92.3%,85.2% and 89.4%, of autologous leukocyte scintigraphy 86.7%,77.8% and 83.3%, respectively. The sensitivity was independent of the amount of the labelled antibody injected (0.1-0.5rag: 96.6%; >0.5-0.9mg:100%;> 0.9-1.00mg:71.4%). False positive lesions were detected in a periprosthetic calcification a frontal hyperostosis and two prosthetic hips which had loosened. H u m a n antimouse antibody (HAMA)could not be detected in any of the 13 patients 1 or 3 months postinjectioz In summary, Tc-99m-IMMU-MN3 is suitable for imaging infectious lesions and has diagnostic advantages over autologous leukocyte scintigraphy.

Active spondylodiscitis could not be diagnosed with TcNCAA but was clearly imaged as focally increased FDG-uptake in all 6 pts with PET. Sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET -100% and 96% respectivelywere significantly superior to TcNCAA (61% and 86%, p<0.01, N=25). These first results indicate a significant potential of FDG-PET for detecting and localizing acitive musculoskeletal inflammatory disease. The specificity and potency of Pamidronate as an inhibitor of osteoc[astic bone resorption provides the rationale for its therapeutic use in osteolytic bone metastases. The mode of its action comprises: a) adsorption onto the surface of hydroxyapatite crystals in mineralized bone matrix, thereby reducing the solubility of the mineralized matrix and rendering it more resistant to osteoclastic resoption and b) impairment of the attachment of ostcoclast precursors to the mineralized matrix, thereby blocking their subsequent transformation into mature, functioning osteoclasts. On the other hand, Rc-186-HEDP exclusively aceumulatcs by chemisorption onto the surface of hydroxyapatite crystals of the ostcosclerotic osseous lesion.",

            "text": "Combined Pamidronate and Re-186-HEDP therapy appears to bc very promissing for the palliation of painful mixed bone metastases. Bone metastases (BM) occur in 80% of patients (pts) with prostate carcinoma, the 2nd most common cancer in males and in 50% of patients with breast carcinoma, the most common cancer in females. Many other primary turnouts frequently metastasize to the skeleton and pain relief often requires long term narcotic analgesia when surgical, hormanal and chemoterapy treatment have failed. External beam radiotherapy may be effective for isolated BM but is difficult Io apply in multifanal disease. Strantium-89 localizes in osteoblastio BM. Its beta particles have sufficient energy to be therapeutically useful However, several reports show very different results in pain palliation, ranging from not different of a planebo response to 82% true response. This report details the results of a retrospective evaluation of 20 therapeutic administrations of 89Sr (about 4mCi iv) to 19 elderly, severely ill pts (1 retreatmont) with painful BM, not aleviated by any of the asual therapeutic means. 16 male and 3 female pie were entered, aged belween 54 and 82 years aid, with a moan age of 68,4\u00b16,3 years. The primary tumor was prostate carcinoma in 16 pts, breast carcinoma in 2 and bladder carcinoma in 1. One female and 1 male pts were lost to follow-up; 4 aditional pie died in a short period (<3 months after 89Sr). The criteria for admission were (1) biopsy-proven tumor, (2) ggmTc-MOP bone scanning with evidence of extensive BM the week preceding therapy, (3) failure of prior canvantional therapy and (4) total WBC count >40(X)/mm3, total platelet count (TPC) >100000/ram3 and serum creatinine concentration <l,6reg/dl. Blood profiles were repeated at intervals of 2 weeks for 3 months. All pts required regular narcotics for relief of pain from BM. Pts were encouraged to keep their analgesic as needed, increasing or decreasing according to pain; 89Sr was utilized as adjunctive therapy. Metastatic spreading was graded according to: I) sites in pelvis and lumbar spine; 2) additional sites in trunk skeleton; 3) generalization. Pts were asked to indicate analgesic intake and level of pain (none, less, same, worse) after 89Sr administration. Response to therapy was assessed at 2 week intervals to 12 weeks. The pain index was regarded as the primary end point for statistical analysis. Imaging was repeated at 3 months (if possible). In one pt who experienced complete pain relief we performed a second therapy. Only 6 (32%) of the 19 pla experienced substancial (4=21%) or complete (2=11%) relief of pain. Pain relief occurred within 20 days of 89Sr administration, and time to maximum response was 2 months, during up to 3 months. 4 pie died early during treatment, with no pain changes. The cause of death was related with the primary tumor, not 89Sr. in 1 pt who experienced complete relief there was recurrence of pain at 3 months, so a retreatmant was pedolmed, with no effect; this pt died soon after. No pt experienced any clinically evident acute side effects or reactions following the injection. 4 (21%) had transient increase in pain (flare response) within 10 days of injantion, subsiding the following days. At weeks 2 through 4, individual declines in the TPC from the baseline level were statistically significant. By 8 weeks after administration, TPC returned to baseline levels in all but 1 pt. Fallow-up bone scans revealed maintenance or progression of disease, without the disappearance of any previously described abnormalities, in 7 treatments. As the extension of metastases into bone determines the ralative nuclide dose and appears as an important parameter of survival, we believe the amount of 89Sr should be adjusted to the BM volume.

We have started examining highly vascularized tumours of the skull base, the meninges and the spinal canal which are already routinely embolised mecanically with microparticles of different sizes in order to reduce the perioperative risk of hemorrhage.

Simultaneous dual-isotope SPECT imaging provides a clear advantage in situations where two concurrent metabolic, anatomic or background measurements are desired. It obviates the need for two separate imaging sessions, reduces patient motion problems, and provides exact image registration between two :studies. However, a potential limitation of dual isotope SPECT imaging is energy spectral cross-talk in both energy windows. Therefore a new convolution method of energy spectral cross-talk correction was developed. The sophisticated, nonuniform RH-2 thoraxheart phantom was used to test the correction technique. Three separate acquisitions were performed, each with two 20% wide energy windows, centered at 140KeV and 70KeV. The data were collected with phantom fdled with 1) Tc-99m solution only, 2) T1-201 solution only, and 3) mixture of Tc-99m + T1-201. The main step in our correction technique was development of the filters which, when convolved with primary energy window images gives scattered images as viewed at other energy windows. In this way it was possible to subtract mutual cross-talk from dualisotope images. The resuks of our method have improved the quality of simultaneous dual-isotope SPECT imaging. We used data from 5 patients with congestive heart failure (60 angles, 64 matrix, 60\"/frame) 4 hours after injection of 185 MBq MIBG. Reproducibility Of L A O methods was good (intra-observer (IA) coefficient of variation (CV) 0.025 typically, inter-observer (IR) CV of 0.012), but the loss of dynamic range down to 1.25 is intolerable. IA-CV of single short-axis slice method w a s 0.2 typically. This was due to poor VC counts statistics. After optimisation of the VC size; the multiple short-axis slice method with a standardised VC had a good reproducebility (IA-CV 0.05, IR-CV 0.06, mean ratio 7.3). MYO/CV ranged from 4 to 25. Bloodpool activity was varying between 400 to 1000 Bq/ml at the time of acquisition. Conclusion: Semi-automated multiple slice quantification with standardised VC regions combined with a single bloodsample is a promising technique in myocardial MIBG-uptake measurement. ",

Projections are collected over 180 or 360 degrees. Before the reconstruction, the projections are corrected for camera efficiency and decay of Tc99m. The 3D-reconstruction algorithm used to reconstruct the normalized data is based on a modified backprojection algorithm. Two methods have been investigated : a 1D Metz filter followed by a 3Dconverging back projection or a 2D prefiltering followed by a 1D ramp filter and the same converging backprojection. The reconstruction program gives the exact size of the organ and provides a correct determination of the volume. A series of 20 slices is reconstructed in about 25 sec. One of the most interesting applications is the tomography of the thyroid. The acquisition is performed with the camera tilted at an angle of 15 degrees in order to be close as possible to the thyroid. In routine practice, the pinhole is located at 10 cm of the center of rotation. With a pinhole of 2 mm, we get a resolution of 5 mm and a sensitivity of 0.25 10 \"4. The 4 mm pinhole gives a sensitivity of 1.0 10 \"4, but with a resolution of 7 mm The resolution obtained with a parallel collimator is always above 12 mm since the distance between collimator and center of rotation cannot be decreased below 20 to 25 cm, because of the shoulders. Several tests of our program have been made on a thyroid phantom at different distances, with different filters, with and without tilt of the camera. Studies on patients are carried out in 15 minutes, after an injection of 185 to 260 MBq (5 to 7 mCi) of Tc99m-pertechnetate. Coronal slices and 3-D volumetric images are used for diagnostic purposes.

Following the i.v.injection of [11C]LTE4NAc in normal rats and monkey, uptake by the liver and subsequent excretion into bile were responsible for its rapid elimination from blood. In the monkey, excretion of the LT into urine played an additional role. Kinetic modeling using a gamma variate function indicated a mean transit time through the liver of 17 min and 34 min in rat and monkey, respectively; the corresponding hepatic excretion halftimes amounted to 8.5 min and 16 min. In a mutant rat strain deficient in the hepatobiliary excretion of cysteinyl LTs, the mean liver transit time was extended to 54 min and the hepatic excretion half-time was 29 min indicating prolonged processes of organ storage and metabolism. Following transport from the liver back into the circulating blood of 0~-oxidized and 13oxidized metabolites of [11C]LTE4NAc, renal excretion compensated for impairment of hepatobiliary elimination. A similar shift from hepatobiliary to renal cysteinyl LT elimination was monitored in rats with cholestasis due to bile duct obstruction.

The ratio lesion to background for the spheres was calculated from circular ROl's (0.5 x sphere diameter) and the ratio lesion to myocardium from rectangular ROl's (16x10 and 15x10 mm2 16% 15% 30% 28% The improvement of lesion contrast for 180 \u00b0 vs. 360 \u00b0 SPECT acquisitions was more pronounced for Tc-99m than for 1-123 or TI-201.",

Labelling of HSA with (2) gave rise to stable products and could be carried out using low protein concentrations (80~tg HSA/100~tl; 42+6% RCY). However, regioselective [ 18F]fluoroacylation of peptides with (2) was not possible. (3) can be used for the 2-[18F]fluoropropionylation of small peptides which are soluble in organic solvents.

In contrast to the syntheses of (1), (2) and (3) (3 steps; KCY 50-60%; 75-90min), preparation of (4) can be done in a single step within 30min (KCY 72_+5%). Conjugation with the in situ generated corresponding nitrene of (4) is achieved by UV irradiation within 5min in the presence of the protein. However, when compared with (2), the time advantage is compensated by a lower conjugation yield and a higher protein concentration (15% RCY at 5001xg/1001al).

Consequently, the PET quantification data can give information about cell proliferation and makes it possible to evaluate therapeutic techniques. Recently we described the selective synthesis and preliminary validation of [C-11]norepinephrine (NE) as a tracer for adrenergic neurons. Metaraminol is a NE congener which has a high affinity for the uptake-1 mechanism and, unlike NE, is not metabolised by MAO and COMT. [F-18] 6-Fluorometaraminol has previously been prepared from [F-18] acetyl hypofluorite (Mislankar et al., 1988) . However, this approach gave a product with too low specific radioactivity corresponding to a dose which is too high for PET studies in humans. In the present work, no-carrier-added preparation of [C-11]metaraminol was achieved by a selective condensation of [C-11] nitroethane with m-hydroxybenzaldehyde followed by reduction with Raney nickel. Chromatographic purification with reversed phase HPLC enabled the separation of the racemic erythroand three-forms of the product. [C-11] Metaraminol was prepared in 13-20% decay corrected radiochemical yield within 45-55 minutes with a specific radioactivity of 300-800 Ci/mmol (11-30 GBq/mmol). PET examination of racemic [C-11]erythro-metaraminol (META) in a Cynomolgus monkey showed a high uptake of radioactivity in the heart. The radioactivity in the myocardium was more than 10 times higher than in adjascent lung tissue and more than 5 times higher than in plasma, In a pretreatment experiment using the NE reuptake inhibitor desiprarnine, radioactivity uptake in the myocardium was decreased by 80%. This observation demonstrates the specificity of META for the NE reuptake in the heart. The metabolism of META, determined in plasma by HPLC, was rapid. The fraction of total radioactivity representing META in plasma was 14% at 6 rain and 8% at 34 rain. High specific radioactivity META should be useful as a radioligand for imaging of cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission in the human heart. Pargyline is a MAO-B inhibitor which has been labelled with 1-123 in order to perform SPECT studies (J Nucl Med, 1993 34; 5, 335p) . For assessment of MAO distribution in brain by PET, Br-76bromopargyline (N-2-bromobenzyl-N-methylpropargylamine) was prepared from the iodinated analogue using heteroisotopic exchange. The Cu+ assisted substitution reaction between nca radioactive bromine and the cold iodine of iodopargyline takes place at 165\u00b0C using gentisic, ascorbic and citric acids as reducing agents. A RP-HPLC \" purification gave Br-76-bromopargyline in a 75% radiochemical yield with a specific activity of 20 MBq/nmol. The inhibitory activity of 2-bromopargyline was assessed in vitro by measuring its potency to inhibit the MAO activity in rat brain homogenates. The IC50 values toward MAO-A (26 nM) and MAO-B (3.3 riM) demonstrated that 2-bromopargyline possess a good selectivity for MAO-B and a higher affinity than pargyline itself (ICso MAO-B= 20 riM). In rats, biodistribution kinetic studies showed a high uptake (0.5% ID/g) of Br-76-bromopargyline in brain. Using ex vivo autoradiographic studies, a preferential localisation of the radiotracer was observed in the pineal gland and the thalamus, brain structures which are known to possess high concentrations of MAO-B. These preliminary results suggest that Br-76-bromopargyline could be a useful radiotracer to study, by PET, the variation of MAO-B activity in neurodegenerative pathologies where monoaminergic neurotransmissions play an important role. For PET studies of the monoamine uptake sites, 13-CIT and its fiuoro analog ([3-CFT) have been labeled with C-1 t. To study the role of the halogen in the selectivity of the tracers for the dopamine reuptake sites, we have labelled the bromo analog I3-CBT [213-carboxy-3l]-(4bromophenyl)-tropane] with Br-76 (T 1/2 =16h). Br-76 I3-CBT was prepared either by electrophilic substitution from the tributyl-stannyl derivative with Br-76 using peracetic acid as oxidant or by nucleophilic substitution using 13-CIT and a Cu + assisted bromodeiodination exchange. Polar by-products were eliminated by SPE using a C18 cartridge and Br-76 13-CBT was purified by RP-ItPLC Using the two techniques, the radiotracer was obtained in 80% and 60% radiochernical yields, respectively, with specific radioactivities -20 GBq/gmol. PET imaging of Br-76 13-CBT biodistribution in baboons demonstrated a rapid and high uptake in the brain (5% ID) and lh after injection, the radioactive concentration in the striatum reached a plateau (0.13% ID/g) that remained constant for 4 h. No specific uptake in the cortex was observed. Due to the constant wash-out in the cerebellum, 4 hours after injection, the striatum to cerebellum ratio was 10. In a baboon with unilateral MPTP induced substantia nigra lesion, the uptake in the diafferented striatum was reduced by 50%, a value similar to that obtained using C11-13-CFT. These results suggest that Br-76 13-CBT has the potential of being developed as a useful PET radiotracer for imaging monoamine uptake sites in pathological conditions. ",

We report our preliminary experience in combined PET and MR imagingperformed in 8 patients with primary cardiac tumors and in 3 patients with mediastinal tumors for evaluation of operative strategy. MR Investigations were performed on a Picker 1.5 T HPQ system using T1weighted spin-echo, segmented k-space, field-echo and bright blood fieldecho sequences. The investigation Was repeated after Gd-DTPA infusion. In 2 patients with large cardiac tumors proton-MR-spectroscopy was attempted, Al/patients underwent leFDG PET before and after glucose loading. Tracer uptake, distribution, and glucose metabolic rates of the tumor and of the surrounding myocardial tissue were evaluated. PET and MR images were also matched by using the software developed in our center. The results were then compared with those from transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), CT and with intraoperative and histologic findings. MR Imaging demonstrated excellent delineation of tumors of the heart andsurrounding structures superior to TTE, TEE and CT due to better soft tissue constrast. In all patients but one the preoperative prediction of the resectability of the tumor was achieved correctly. Compared to TEE, MRI failed in most cases to detect tumorous lesions smaller than 0.5 cm, particularly those which involved the papillary muscle and those involving the right ventricle. Slight improvement in the detection of such small lesions was achieved after Gd-infusion. Tumor infiltration and expansion detected in MRI correlates well with enhanced tumor glucose metabolism. These can help in the evaluation of tumor dignity. In 1 Patient with an enlarged hemangioma in the right ventricle with significant obstruction of the outflow tract, the combined PET and MR images were falsely interpreted as well vascularized malign sarcoma of the heart. However, as confirmed by intraoperative findings, the non-resectability of the lesion was correctly diagnosed.

We evaluated the value of IIIIn-HIG for diagnosing AL in 35 patients (mean age 59\u00b14.7) with ultrasonographically suspected AL in the carotid arteries. A comparative study between lllIn-HIG and 125I-LDL uptake in AIL was also performed in cholester01-fed rabbits. Four hours after iv injection of 500uCi IIIIn-HIG ap images (500000 counts/frame) of the neck were obtained with a gamma camera. The HIGuptake was also continuously monitored with detectors placed over the carotid arteries and a background region and time-activity curves were analysed. After injection of 10uCi IIIIn-HIG and 1251-LDL, the HIG-entry into aortic segments was evaluated in animals. In order to compare the long term prognostic value of left v e n t r i c u l a r ejection fraction (LVEF) routinely determined by single plane Xray angiography and by equilibrium radionuclide angiography (RNA), a 5-year follow-up period was obtained in 103 consecutive pts (99 men, 54\u00b18 years) with Q wave MI, who had X-ray and radionuclide LV-angiography, and who were initially treated medically. X-ray LVEF, determined by cardiac catheterization (area-length method on a 30 \u00b0 RAO) was higher than that determined by RNA (manual method on a LAO) in the overall population (p<.05). BUt the difference was marked for pts with anterior MI (n=51) (46\u00b113% vs 39\u00b114%, p<.001) and absent in the others (47\u00b113% vs 49\u00b110%, NS). When we compared pts with cardiac death (n=13) to those without death, cardiac surgery or angioplasty (n=79) during the 5-year of follow-up, MI location was more frequently anterior (85% vs 47%, p<.02) and both X-ray and RNA LVEF were lower. However, the difference between the 2 groups was slight for X-ray LVEF (41\u00b112% vs 48\u00b112%, p<.05) and much more marked for RNA LVEF (32\u00b112% vs 46\u00b112%, p<.001). Compared with single plane X-ray angiographic determination, LVEF calculated by RNA appears to be a better long term predictor of cardiac death after Q wave MI. This might be related to improved assessment of LV function in anterior MI. Can the immunogenicity of radiolabeled routine antibodies be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment at nontoxic doses?",

Their replacement with human or humanized antibodies provides a partial solution to this problem. However, in the organ transplant field, where anti-T-lymphocyte murine monoclonal antibodies have been used for more than 10 years, an alternative approach to reduce sensitization frequency consists in associating conventional immunosuppressants with monoclonal antibody treatment protocols. Thus, we tested low-dose, short-term immunosuppressive treatment in 14 patients injected with 1 mg of F(ab')2 fragments of 0C125 antibody for scintigraphic detection of recurrences of ovarian carcinoma. We administered 15 mg/day of prednisolone and 3 mg/kg/day (but not more than 150 mg/day) of azathioprine, for six consecutive days (beginning 2 days before immunoconjugate injection). The appearance of anti-OC125 human antibodies was monitored by a solidphase immunoenzymatic technique (ELISA). Three of these 14 patients (21%) developed human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), whereas in a control group receiving the same preparation of F(ab')2 fragments (without immunosuppressive treatment) 7/22 subjects (32%) developed HAMA (nonsignificant difference). Thus, this type of immunosuppressive regimen did not significantly reduce immunization against the xenogenic protein. The possibility of using other types of short-term (<10 days) immunosuppressive treatments in association to immunoscintigraphic and radioimmunotherapeutic protocols will be discussed.

Since radiolabelled granulocytes(RLG) are taken up by the bone marrow (BM), interfering with the interpretation of the granalocyte scans, a colloid scan is usually necessary to define RM, the distribution of which is significantly altered after surgery. R i G uptake in BM as early as 1 hr after injection is more evident when granulocytes are labelled with Tc-99m HMPAO, and suggests granulocyte margination, which could be used to define BM. If this assumption is true, then, labelling of granalocytes with both Tc-99m and In-111 and using the early Tc-99m signal to define BM and late InLG signal to show the migration to CBI would avoid the need for a colloid scan.The aims of this study were,therefore, 1) to establish the nature of early RLG uptake in BM, 2) to describe a new technique of labelling granalocytes with both In-111 and Tc-99m t-IMPAO in order to exploit this uptake, 3) to verify the functional integrity of these granulocytes, and 4) to predict the feasibility of this technique for the diagnosis of CBI in humans. Fifty seven patients were studied in 2 parts. In the first part, we retrospectively quantified InG uptake in BM, spleen (Sp), liver (iv) and 3 different types of inflammatory lesions (Le) by comparing the early and late Le/BM ratio with Le/Sp and Le/Lv ratios. In the prospective second part, we labelled granulocytes with both In-Ill and Tc-99m HMPAO, studied their kinetics in Sp, Lv and BM in 14 patients with painful prosthetic hip, and compared this technique with colloid BM scan in 9 patients. We showed that 57% of the BM signal from InG at 3 br was due to marginated cells. The corresponding values for Sp and Lv were 71% and 47%, respectively. In the second part, cell labelling efficiency was 38.6%+12 and 62.6% + 14 for Tc-99m-HMPAO and In-Ill, respectively. Granulocyte activation, determined as the percentage of cells showing shape change, and recovery of double labelled granulocytas were similar to those previously published for single labelling.",

Protocols No. 3 and No. 4 were identical, except for the omission of blood perfusion. Protocol 5 (No. 5) equaled No. 4, but storage time was extended to 24 h. MRS was performed using a 4.7 T/40 cm diameter system with 60 \u00b0 pulses at 81 MHz and subsequent Fourier analysis under identical conditions for all five protocols after reperfusion with warm homologous blood. During perfusion, index of [3-ATP and inorganic phosphate (13-ATP/Pi) was compared at 20 and 80 rain, respectively. Medians (n=6, each protocol) of y-ATP/Pi are given in the .082 Additional perfusion with warm blood decreases recovery of ~-ATP. Increase of storage time from 1-2 h to 4-6 h increases recovery of [3-ATP, while storage time of 24 h worsens I~-ATP recovery. In conclusion, in explanted liver best preservation is received by cold storage for 1-2 h in collins solution only, possibly due to reduced thrombosis. ",

A MonteCarlo code (EGS4 -PRESTA) has bean employed to simulate the emission and to transport the beta and gamma emission in human tissue. We have calculated the kernel scaled beta dose in water in order to evaluate the dose distribution around a source point.

She was asked to prevent a pregnancy. Nevertheless, in the course of radioiodine therapy an attended gynaecologist found the woman pregnant in the 24 m week of gravidity. Consequently radioiodine has been administered during the 2 \u00b0a and the 22 nd week of pregnancy, each time 3700 MBq. The ovarial dose resulting from the radioiodine administrations before pregnancy was estimated to 2200 mGy (220 rd), the foetal doses resulting from the two administrations during pregnancy to 250 mGy (25 rd) in each case, and the foetal thyroid dose to between 90 Gy (9000 rd) and 900 Gy (90000 rd) for the 2 nd therapy during pregnancy. Because of the risk of malformations this pregnancy was interrupted taking the recommendations of the so-called Danish model as a basis for the decision. The foetus was studied with regard to possible consequences of radiation exposure by pathologico-anatomical cytogenetic and radiobiological methods. In the foetus the most important changes were found within the thyroid gland (atrophy, sclerosis, subcapsular interstitial fibrosis, necrobiosis of follicular epithelial cells). On the other hand, analysing the karyotype using dermal fibroblastic cell cultures, no radiation induced chromosomal aberrations were seen. The results of these studies present in detail give useful information on effects to be expected as a result of radioiodine application during certain periods of pregnancy.

However, in-vivo use is limited by the complex dosimetry. We report on our experience with an 170Eroxide enriched enteric coated pancreatic enzyme preparation used in dual isotope gastric emptying studies. Other labelling techniques were considered inappropriate because of possible interference with the pH-dependent release of the pancreatic enzymes, which was measured simultaneously. Neutron activation of biological materials results in many radioactive isotopes besides 171Er. This affects scintillation camera operation and adds to the radiation dose. The activation yields, half IEes, and radio-toxicity vary strongly. Therefore, all these radiocontaminants (RC) must be taken into accmmt Within the limits for adequate imaging, the ratio of committed dose equivalent due to 171Er and the total committed dose equivalent should be maximised. This ratio varies with the interval between neutron activation and ingestion (IAI). This ratio and the dose are most easily calculated when the ALI (ICRP 61) is used as a common denominator. After optimisation, 171Er accounted for 83% of the committed dose equivalent of 0.5 rosy per MBq of 171Er. The isotopic content was verified through instrumental neutron activation analysis. Some pitfalls are : -23Na is omnipresent in biomatefials; 24Na emits high energy photons that penetrate conventional high-energy collimators and interfere with image quality; -isotopic enrichment (in our case 97.9 % 170Er) does not preclude significant amounts of other lanthanides (i.e. in this case 5400 ppm of other lanthanides); -many RC may result, each with its own unique physical and biological properties (i.e. beta-emitters such as 32P and 35S); -RC may be present in a chemical form for which dosimettic data is not available; -for trace contaminants very. large batch-to-batch variations must be anticipated (i.e. Lu varying from < 10 to 700 ppm); -the neutron beam energy, spectrum may include epithermal and fast neutrons, resulting in increased activation yields for some elements; If these pitfalls are taken into consideration, neutron activation of isotopically enriched pharnmcentieals is a suitable labelling technique that does not interfere with specific galenic properties.

While physical and mathematical phantoms satisfy the needs of checking the quality of equipment, they may not be fully relevant to check the quality of a clinical software Recently, the software phantoms (clinically validated patient data available in a standard format) have been introduced for the purpose. They meet most of clinical quality control requirements except the need of precise quantification: values of derived diagnostic parameters are estimated in uncertain confidence limits. In order to overcome this drawback we suggest to complete the spectrum of testing tools by a hybrid phantom which combines some features of simulated and software phantoms. The hybrid phantom is made with the help of factor analysis: (I) the standard software phantom is decomposed to oblique factors and noise residuals, (2) factor curves are either modified or substituted by those generated by a physiological model, (3) hybrid dynamic data are reconstructed using original factor images and new factor curves, {4) hybrid phantom is completed by an addition of original noise. The hybrid phantom thus represent the sequence of images with real structures and S/N ratio close to original, manifesting the known dynamics generated by physiological model. For the purpose of semiquant\u00b1tative (comparative) evaluation and/or the separation of spatial and temporal information, factor curves of another patient may also be substituted after adjustment to original factor contributions. In order to test the effect of noise, a series of identical phantoms with different contributions of original noise can be generated The hybrid phantom is considered to be a useful supplement rather than a substitution of the simulated and software phantoms Phantoms generated using time-activity curves of different origin are demonstrated together with the source data. Applications in the quality control of various clinical software are demonstrated and discussed.",

To fulfil these goals, an European Nuclear Cardiology Data base (ENCD) is being built with the collaboration of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine, the European Society of Cardiology and the European Communities COST B2 program \"Quality Assurance of N,clear Medicine Software\". The ENCD includes normal subjects and patients with typical patterns of myocardial ischemia, recent myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy, selected according to predefined criteria which exclude radionuclide data. Acquisition protocols have been designed for planar gated blood pool studies, planar and SPECT myocardial studies using TI-201 and Tc-99m Cardiotite (Eur J Nucl Med 1993, 20:59-65). Acquisition portfolios have been created and widely distributed for the collection of the necessary clinical and test data, respecting medical privacy. The portfolio keys have been defined in agreement of 41 European nuclear medicine physicians and cardiologists. To participate, one must provide radionuclide acquisition data, converted into Interfile format, with completed portfolios. These will be included in the ENCD after a group of experts have checked that the data meet the required quality. In order to prepare further steps, the acquisition portfolio includes the parameters to be obtained by processing. A processing portfolio, now being created, will be distributed with the ENCD. The numerical values will be processed with variance analysis, to help define ranges. It is planned that the ENCD will be made available on CD-ROM to the nuclear medicine community in 1995. The ENCD can then be applied by any user for all of the above goals.",

In particular, the incorporation of a suitable ligand into the structure of these complexes may lead to the preparation of a tracer for monitoring metabolic pathways. Glucose is a fundamental substrate for heart and brain metabolism and the stable incorporation of a glucose derivative into the chemical structure of a Tc-99m complex should be a fundamental step in the effort to obtain a Tc-99m-analogue of FDG.

The compounds were stable in vitro for a period of 4 hours.They have been characterized by TLC chromatography and by comparision with the corresponding Tc-99 analogues. Both complexes have a square-pyramidal structure with an apical TcN group.

In complex 2, the comdination of two monoanionic dithiocarbamate ligands through the four sulphur atoms led to the formation of a neutral compound.

Optimum formulation contained ECD.HCI I mg, 0.5 mg EDTA, stannous chloride and mannitol as stabilizer. Formulation was performed under controlled temperature and nitrogematm, at pH 6.0.

The aim of this study was to test different purification methods and to study the biodistribution of 99Tc-IL2 in mice. Human recombinant 1L2 was labelled using a bifunctional N3S chelating agent as previously described. Labelled IL2 was purified by gel filtration (G50M, PD10 column, Pharmacia), and reversed phase (RP), chromatography using a C18 Classic Sep-Pak column (Waters) (0.1% H3PO4, 5% ethanol, pH=2 solvent A; 0.5% H3PO4 in ethanol, pH=3, solvent B), or a C8 HPLC column (Beckman) (0.1% trifluoro acetic acid (TFA), 5% acetonitrile, pH=1.7 solvent A; 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile, pH=2.2, solvent B). The receptor binding capacity of 99mTc-lL2 was tested by an indirect assay. Biodistribution of 99mTc-IL2 (< l,ug), purified by either method was studied in Balb/c mice (n=8). Sep-Pak purified 99mTe-IL2 (M5,ug), was also tested in normal volunteers in man (n=2). IL2 LE was -20% (SA: ~3GBq/mg). 99mTc-IL2 purified by gel filtration, when injected into mice was taken-up mainly by liver, suggesting aggregation of IL2 during labelling. 99mTc-IL2 eluted at --60%B in the RP HPLC, 100%B was used for elution of 99mTc-IL2 in a small volume with Sep-Pak. Studies of receptor binding indicated that 99mTc-lL2 retained unaffected its receptor binding capacity. Biodistribution of RP purified 99mTc-lL2 showed a kinetics similar to that of iodine labelled IL2. 99mTc-lL2 metabolization, determined by TCA precipitation of sera, showed a higher in vivo stability compared to iodine labelled IL2, probably due to the fast in vivo dehalogenation of tyrosine residues of iodine labelled IL2. Studies in normal volunteers showed that 99mTc-lL2 has a kinetis similar to that of 123I-IL2. Our results suggest the use 99mTc-lL2 in man for the in vivo detection of lymphocytic infiltration. ",

The biological behaviour and especially the retention in the blood of this new preparation was evaluated in mice and a rabbit. Blood retention was clearly higher than that of unmodified 99mTc-HSA and was comparable to that of the reference compound a2SI-HSA. Finally, a preliminary study in a human volunteer was performed with the 16/1 preparation. At 2 hours p.i., 83% of the initial activity was retained in the vascular compartment and only 1.2% was excreted into the urine vs, respectively 59% and 17% for unmodified 99~Tc-HSA. These results indicate that the preparation of a stable 99mTc-HSA derivative is possible using the bifunctional chelate approach, resulting in a preparation with a clearly higher vascular retention. T1201/Tc99m subtraction (T1-Tc) scintigraphy is a well established method in the detection of parathyroid adenomas. Recently Tc99m-Sestamibi (MIB1) has been proven to be rapidly cleared from the thyroid tissue and longer retained in the parathyroid adenomas c l e a r l y delineated in a late image. 9 patients (8F, 1M; aged 57-79 yrs) with c l i n i c a l and biochemical pattern of primary hyperparathyroidism (Ca:10-23 mg%; P:2.7-3.8 mg%; Intact PTH: 127-1450 pg/ml) were studied with both methods. All of them had surgical confirmation of parathyroid adenoma. All patients were injected with 20 mCi of MIBI and imaged at 30 min and again at 2--3 hrs; one week l a t e r the T1-Tc scintigraphy was performed. MIBI scintigraphy correctly revealed s o l i t a r y adenoma in the neck in 8 patients and a mediastinal adenoma in one, c l e a r l y localized by SPET. T1-Tc scintigraphy revealed the adenoma in 7 patients, including the mediastinal adenoma. MIBI scintigraphies were of better quality than those obtained with T1-Tc due to the physical properties of Tc99m and not requiring any subtraction techniques. Unfortunately we found the parathyroid pattern of MIBI in 3 patients with Hurtle c e l l carcinoma of the thyroid, so l i m i t i n g the s p e c i f i c i t y of the method. However the dual-phase technique with M1BI promises to be superior to the dual-isotopes technique in the scintigraphic evaluation of parathyroid adenomas. ",

Thus, iodine supply via iodinated kitchen salt only is not as stable as had been hoped for. The reasons are multiple: a reduced intake of table salt, increased consumption of imported food, which have not been prepared with iodinated salt, diversified eating habits, increased number of meals taken outside the family table due to a rising female professional occupation, longer transport times to the working place and increasing numbers of single's households.

Results: The ratio of 131 I/cold iodine was 3 times higher in group E than in group D patients. Euthyroid patients under T4 (0.15+0.04 mg T4/day or 98_+3 pg iodine/day) (E) had plasma iodine values by 40% higher than hypothyroid patients (D). An increasing TSH level was associated with a decreasing plasma iodine level: by 40% after thyroidectomy (C), by 51% after an additional radioiodine \"elimination\" of thyroid remnants (D). On the opposite, decreasing TSH was associated with increasing plasma iodine. This -only initally -linear correlation (\"n=0.64\") is but an illusion. The effective stimulation of an increased 1311 uptake is due to the depletion of competing cold iodine after withdrawal of the substitutive T4: this manoeuvre increases the specific activity of radioiodine. The parallel increase of TSH in itself is not the reason for a better radioiodine uptake in the tumor. Treatment of hyperthyroidism with 1-131 is well accepted and usually results in a substantial decrease in thyroid volume. However, few data are available on the effect of 1-131 treatment on thyroid volume reduction in non-toxic goiter and the results are seldom evaluated by objective methods. CT is an accurate and reproducible method to determine volume reduction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 1-131 on goiter volume measured by CT. Twenty-seven patients (mean age: 58.1 -+ 10.5 yr) with complaints of goiter entered the study. All patients had a normal plasma TSH, or a suppressed plasma TSH with a normal plasma T4 (or T3).

Two dimensional echocardiography (2DE) evaluates myocardial dysfunctions, and during infusion of Low Dose Dobutamlne (LDD) recognises hypoakinetic Myocardial Segments (MS) with contractile reserve. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) with intracoronary injection of a sonicated contrast medium gives information about myocardial microvascular integrity. From intracellular uptake of 99mTc-MIBI it is possible to obtain the regional perfusion patterns. To evaluate if there is a 99mTc MIBI uptake in postinfarction dysfunctioning MS with contractile reserve and microvascular integrity, we studied 5 pts with AMI (3 anterior, 1 lateral and 1 posterior) . All pts underwent 2DE monitoring (at day 1,3,5,7,15), LDD (5 mcg/kg/min for 5 rain. and i0 mcg/kg/min for a further i0 rain.) at day 5, MCE at the time of coronary angiography, with selective intracoronary injection of sonicated Ioxaglate, and 99n~c-MIBI SPET. 13-(p-[~231]iodophenyl)-3-(p-phenylene) tridecanoic acid (PHIPA) is a radiolabelled synthetic long chain fatty acid with prolonged myocardial retention (biological half life up to 70 hours) due to a trapping mechanism caused by the p-phenylene group in the alkyl chain. The present study examined the ability of myocardial scintigraphy with PHIPA in comparison to thallium-201 for the detection and estimation of coronary artery disease.",

A possible reason could be a degeneration of the myocyte s ~/fter MI. An other possibility is a chron!c cellular ischemia produced by a distuibed microperfusion after MI. This theory is supported by an improvement of the energy metabolism in hypokinetic regions by GTN. To differ whether a reduction of the PCr/ATP-ratio is really a sign of cellular ischemia in coronary heart disease further investigations are needed. The results of dobutamine (DOB) stress scintigraphy and 2D echocardiography were compared in 21 patients (mean age 58 years) with old MI. 9 patients had an inferior, 8 an anteroseptal, 2 an apical and 2 an anteroseptal and inferior resting WMA documented by echocardiography. :DOB stress was performed by using a stepwise increasing dosage (5-10-20-30-40-40 micrograms/kg/min, each step over 3 min). During the test, continuous echocardiographic monitoring was performed. If the age-dependent submaximal heart rate was not attained after the second 40 micrograms/kg/min dose, 0.25 mg/min of atropine was given over 4 rain. 200 MBq of SESTAMIBI was injected immediately after termination of the DOB or atropine infusion. Myocardial perfusion SPECT studies were performed according to a one-day protocol (750 MBq SESTAMIBI for the resting study). Echocardiography was evaluated from the standard views. SPECT studies were evaluated by a combined consideration of the short-axis, horizontal and vertical long-axis slices and quantitative polar maps. Improved wall motion (WM) at low dose DOB (viability) was signalized in 6 myocardial regions in 5 patients. In these territories scintigraphy documented stress-induced ischemia in 3 cases, an enhanced defect size at rest in 1 patient, and a persistent perfusion defect in 2 cases. Stress-induced WMA was documented in 8 patients. These ischemic segments were concordantly identified with scintigraphy in 6 patients; myocardial perfusion was normal in 2 patients. On the other hand, scintigraphy documented stress-induced myocardial ischemia in 10 regions of 8 patients, without changes in regional WM during stress. 5 of these regions had resting WMA, but 5 did not. It is concluded that the results of DOB stress myocardial SPECT and 2D echocardiography are different in nearly half of the patients with old MI, and these diagnostic modalities can not replace each other.

We studied 17 patients ( 15 m, 2F, mean age 53+/-gyrs ) with multivessel coronary artery disease ( CAD ), previous infarction and reduoed ejection ( EF ) at resting echocardiography ( < 30% ). We used a sixt~n scgmants ventdoular model for DSE and TI SPECT. DSE was analysed using a score index ranging from 1 (nonnokinesis) to 4 (dyskinesis). Each short axis reconstraoted from SPECT raw images was divided into six segments and the mean count was caloulated for each one. Sogment~fl 29 uptake was determina~ed as a percentage of the maximum among all short axis sections. A segment was considered viable when resting dyssynergy ( score > 2 ) showed an improvement of one grade or more during Dobutamine infusion and when 11 uptake was >50%. The findings of DSE and rest TI imaging were compared in a total of 272 segments, 232 of which wcrc dyssynorgyc segments: 150 were akinetio and 82 hypokinetie segments. Rest TI imaging showed viable myocardinm in 93/150 (62%) akinetie segments. Of them 76 (82%) showed no improvement at DSE. Of 82 hypokinetic segments 75 (91%) were seen as viable by TI imaging. Of them 43 (57%) showed no improvement at DSE. Thus, concordance between TI SPECT and DSE in idenfifing viable myocardium was dew: DSE showed wall motion improvement in 49/168 (29%) viable segments. Concordance was higher for non viable scgmems: 58/64 (91%). In conclusion, in patients with CAD and reduced EF, DSE if compared with TI SPECT as reference test, showed low sensitivity (29%), high specificity (91%) and moderate accuracy (46%) in detecting viable myocardium. Introduction: The accurate assessment of myocardial viability is of major importance in patients(pts) following myocardial infarction. Purpose: The aim of our study was to determine whether immediate thallium-2Gl(TI) reinjection(Ri) imaging provides adequate information regarding myocardial viability. In 23 pts with documented anterior wall infarction results of the immediate Ei procedure were compared with 1)TI rest(Re) redistribution(Rd) images, and 2)left ventricular wall motion(Win) obtained with radionuclide angiography(RNA). Methods: For the Ri procedure TI (75 MBq) was injected at maximal Ex and reinjected (37 MBq) immediately post Ex imaging followed by imaging 60 rain later. Re imaging was performed on a separate day 60 minutes after injection of TI (75 MBq). In 13/23 pts additional Rd images were acquired 3 h after Re imaging On each set of TI images, 8 segments(sugm) were visually and quantitatively analyzed. Ex data were compared with Ri images, Re images and Rd images. Myocardial segments were classified as viablelV\u00f7 (normal, ischemic, non ischemic viable)}, and non-viable(V-). Left ventricu]ar Wm of the infarct region was studied by RNA performed at rest and during Ex Regional Wm was classified as normal, hypokinetic or a/dyskinetic. All but persistent a/dyskJnetJc regions were considered viable. Results: Ex-RB (n=184 segrn) \u00a3x-Rd (n=104 see'n) Wm(n=23 pts) V+ V-V+ V-V+ ",

We investigated 21 patients (pts) before and two months after ACB. 58 grafts revascularized (rev) 41 of 49 (84%) territories perfused by a stenosed artery. In the LAD territory revascularization was achieved in 62% by the internal mammary artery (IMA), in 38% by vein grafts (SVG) and 34% of the pts had both, IMA-and SVG-grafts. 200 MBq of IPPA were injected at the end of a submaximal exercise. After exercise SPECT-scintigraphy (ECT-I) was performed which was repeated after 15 min with pts in the same position (ECT-II). Oblique slices were obtained and divided into 5 segments (sgs) which served for quantification. Comparison of sgs of ECT-I before and after therapy served for evaluation of uptake (flow, up) and sgs of ECT-II for turnover (metabolism, met In conclusion, restitution of flow early after reperfusion therapy can be clearly demonstrated by IPPA studies. Many myocardial regions show persitantly abnormal fatty acid metabolism after therapy with no major difference between IMA and SVG grafts. The outcome of the patients in terms of fatty acid uptake and metabolism was best in the case of a combined IMA and SVG therapy. The clinical impact of the rein.iection (REI) in different groups of patients (pts.) undergoing TI 201 stress study remains still uncertain. Aim of the study was to assess whether the REI, performed in pts with first myocardial infarction (MI) treated by thrombolysis ( < 6 h), gives significant additional information compared with the conventional stress-redistribution (ST-RD) T1 ECT scan.",

Purpose: The aim of our study was to establish the clinical value of immediate TI reinjection imaging for the detection of the distinct aspects of lschemic heart disease. A total of 138 pts with undiagnosecl chest pain and documented coronary anatomy were studied. Fifty-six (41%) of the 138 pts had previous myocardial infarction(MI). Of the remaining 82 pts(59%), 24 pts(17%) had low likelihood coronary artery disease(GAD). Methods: TI (75 MBq} was injected at maximal Ex and reinjected (37 MBq) immediately after completing 3 view planar Ex imaging. Resting images were acquired 60 minutes after reinjection. Each set of T1 images was visually and quantitatively analyzed and compared with artedographic findings and left ventdeular wall motion. Scintigraphic detection of stress induced ischemia was based on T1 Ex data in all 138 pts., detection of re~,'ersible ischemia on reversibility of TI defects in 50 pts with proven GAD and previous MI, and detection of viability on sevedty of T1 defects in 168 vascular regions of 56 MI pts.

In order to compare stress echocardiegraphy (Echo) with perfasion 99mTc-Sestamibi (MIBI), we have used stress dobutamine to study 110 patients (pts). However, 23 pts were excluded due to inconclusive stress test. The remaining 87 pts, 74 males and 13 females, <age>=57.4+lO years, 56 pts with previous myocardial infarction and 31 with anger. 37 pts (43%) had \u00a2oronariography with significant lesions. Left ventricle ejection fraction by equilibrium angiocardiogrephy was in the anterior infarction = 32.7+12.7\u00b0/,, in the inferior = 51.2+8.3% and in pts without infarction = 53.4+9.5%. Pts were infused with dobutamine until maximal dose of 40mg/kg/min or a new regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) was detected by Echo or if standard clinical criteria appeared for stopping infusion. No major side effects were referred. However, in 12/23 pts out of the study, the infusion was stopped due to increased BP in 8 and SVE in the others. During the infusion Echo study was performed and 15 mCi of MIBI was administered at test end, with infusion continuing one more minute. SPECT was performed 1 hour later and rest SPECT at 48 hours. MIBI and Echo were analyzed qualitatively, considering 12 segments of left ventricle. We have considered normal segments and two lesions types, namely necrosis ffi irreversible MIBI lesions = stress and rest Echo RWMA and ischaemic = reversible MIBI lesions = stress Echo RWMA. Of a total of 1044 (12 x 87) segments analyzed, 813 (77.9%) had the same classification with MIBI and Echo. The most discordant wall was the anterior (72.5+16.8%) and the most concordant studies were in the patients without previous infarction (86+14%). If we consider myocardial ischaemia, we found only 28% of concordance in a total of 47 pts with ischaemia in at least one of the two methods. Dobutamine stress echocardiegraphy seems to offer an alternative to 99mTc-Sestamibi, in the identification of CAD with a 78% concordance. Our results show, however, a poor match in the detection of ischaemic myocardium, which is the main purpose of the method (28% of concordance). No statistical differences were found related with the infarction localization. However, in pts without previous myocardial infarction we have obtained better results, perhaps because it is easier the valorization of RWMA, when no rest alteration exists, which may account for the principal indication for stress Echo. The aim of the study was to establish if the high dose dip SPECT brings more diagnostic informations than low dose dip SPECT. 32 patients (pts) with coronary artery disease without infarct were examined. Low-dose dip (0,56 mg/kg) was administered i.v. to 18 pts (group I); high-dose dip (0,7 mg/kg) was administered i.v. to 14 pts (group I1.) Administration of dip was connected with minimal exercise, The both groups of pts were matched in age, resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure. All pts underwent two 99m-Tc-MIB[ SPECT studies performed 15 days apart, one after dip administration and another one after submaximal bicycle stress (85% age-predicted heart rate). Agreement in defects size, their type and localization between dip SPECT and stress SPECT was observed in 17 of 18 pts (group l) and in 13 of 14 pts (group II). The following side -effects were observed: ST segment depression in group I -2 pts, in group II -3 pts; chest pain in group I -2 pts, in group II -4 pts.

Combined use of MAA uptake and Xe washout gives an objective criterion to evaluate healing potential of diabetic foot ulcers. Aim of this study was to examine if myocardial activity of Tc-99m-sestamibi is stable after injection. Sestamibi myocardial scintigraphy was performed in 15 consecutive patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (2-day-protocol; 2 x 300 MBq). After submaximal bicycle exercise, SPECT was performed 5 min (early) and 2 hours (late) after injection. The rest study consisted of one scintigraphic acquisition about 100 min p.i. The left ventricular myocardium was divided into six segments and sestamibi uptake was scored semiquantitatively by 2 experienced observers using a 5-point grading system. In all studies a sufficient image quality was achieved for interpretation of slices. However, image quality was affected by hepatic activity in early SPECT in some patients. A total of 114 segments was analysed. In 69/114 segments initial defects were detectable. In 72/114 segments no difference in score could be registered between early and late SPECT. In 35/114 segments the score improved within the first 120 min p.i. (fill-in of initial defects). The early fill-in could be correlated with a significant narrowing of the corresponding coronary artery in most cases. In 7/114 segments a deterioration in score from early to late SPECT was documented (tracer wash-out); in 6 of these 7 segments the score returned to its initial value (n=2) or improved (n=4) in the rest scan. In 1 segment sestamibi was washed-out between early and late SPECT and tracer uptake remained low in the rest study. A clear correlation between tracer wash-out and coronary anatomy could not be detected. Myocardial Tc-99m-sestamibi activity is not stable after injection: Early tracer washout can be documented as well as a fill-in of initial defects. SPECT should be performed immediately after exercise; later acquisitions may be performed if image quality is poor. The Silent Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (SAC) includes an inhomogeneous spectrum of life-threatening arrhythmogenic cardiac diseases without valuable functional impairment. In order to establish the efficacy of 123I-MIBG scan as diagnostic marker in SAC 18 patients (18 males -0 females, aged 18 -45 yrs), with high physical performances, \"clinically normal\" heart, and hypercinetic ventricular arrhythmias (9/18 with sustained ventricular tachycardia a/o ventricular fibrillation,2 of them resuscitated) were studied and compared with a control group of 5 subjects.In all of them we performed: a) a complete cardiological study comprehensive of echocardiography M and 2D mode; b) tomographic scan 4 hours after injection of 370 MBq of 123I-MIBG and 1 hour after injection of 740 MBq of 99mTc-MIBI with tomographic camera Orbiter Siemens, HR collimator,64 matrix, 64 views, 180 \u00b0 rotation. Both data were reconstructed by filtered backprojection (SLH, cut off: 0.5 MIBG, 0.8 MIBI).The Cardiac Magnetic Resonance was also performed in 9/18 and the Coronarography in 7/18. All the investigations were normal in the control group; in the other patients the cardiological study detected a cardiomyopathy in 12/18 (6 Right Ventricular Arrhytbmogenic Disease, 4 Biventricular Cardiomyopathy, 1 Left Ventricular Dilated Cardiomyopathy, 1 Coronary Artery Disease [CAD]).I 1/18 patients showed focal defects with MIBG: 6 in the apex, 2 in the anterior wall, 3 in the lateral, 4 in the septal and 7 in the inferior. With MIBI we observed defects in 4 patients: 2 defects in the anterior wall, 3 in the lateral and 2 in the inferior.In all cases, except one (CAD), there is a mismatch between MIBG and MIBI defects.Versus SAC the MIBG scan has demostred: Sensitivity 83.3 %, Specificity 83.3 %, Predictive Positive Value 90.9 %, Predictive Negative Value 71.4 %, Accuracy 83.3 %. These preliminary findings suggest that the MIBG may be a good marker to evaluate defects of the cardiac adrenergic innervation in SAC and that it may play an important role in the difficult detection of these cardiac diseases. The aim of the study was to compare adrenergic innervation and myocardial perfusion in diabetic and non-diabetic patients who had serious coronary artery stenosis. 1-123 MIBG, a guanethidine analague was used for scintigraphic assesment of myocardial symphatetic innervation. A total of 19 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who had documented multivessel disease in coronary angiography, 8 diabetics (D) and 11 non-diabetics (ND) were included, prior to by-pass surgery. After a 30 rain. resting period, all patients received 110 Mbq of 1-123 MIBG. SPECT data and planar views were obtained starting at 15 minutes and 4 hours after the injection. In all patients, rest -T1-201 SPECT study was also performed within two days to asses myocardial perfusion and viability. Heart to mediastinum (H/M) 1-123 MIBG activity ratios in early and delayed views were quantified.. T1-201 and 1-123 MIBG SPECT data were compared in respect of defect size, in tomographic planes and polar maps. In D patients globally poor cardiac uptake of 1-123 MIBG was observed. In all patients segmentally larger denervative areas in disease sites were identified when compared to T1-201 perfusion defects. A statistically significant difference in H/M ratios of 1-123 MIBG uptake was detected between D and ND patients in early and delayed views; D: 1.72 + .11, ND: 2.13 + .22, D: 1.51 + .24, ND: 2.30 _+ .15, P< .005. However , it has not reached a statistically difference, a slight increase in 1-123 MIBG uptake in ND patients and a decrease in D patients was noted in delayed views. We conclude that, D CAD patients had significantly poor sympathetic myocardial innervation when compared to ND's without any relation with the severity of CAD. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical importance of viable but denervated myocardium in D patients in respect of prognosis after coronary by-pass surgery.",

Sets of scintigraphic planar anterior images were performed at 4 and 24 hours. Data was collected over 15ran in a 128x128 pixel matrix. Uptakes in the heart (H), lung (Lu) and liver ( Statistical analysis using paired t Test didn't find any differences between Lu/Lu and H/H (4 and 24h), but there was a significant difference between Lu4/Lu24 and Li4/Li24 compared with H4/H24 (p<0.00l). Statistical differences were found between LulH and Li/H at 4 and 24h (p<0.05). No inter-patients differences in heart, lung and liver washout was tbund, suggesting a true neuronal uptake. No correlation was found between plasma cathecolamines concentration and MIBG uptake, suggesting autonomic function. In 88% of pt, the MIBG uptake normal results suggest normal pre-sinaptic function. In only 2 pt (12%) the results did suggest adrenergic nervous system disfunction.",

Nevertheless, the effects of these drugs on myocardial presynaptic sympathetic uptake-storage function are not well known. Therefore, the effects of the fSl-antagonist metoprolol on the presynaptic neuronal uptake of MBBG, a norepinephrine analog, were studied in normal rabbits. This species was chosen because previous study has shown that the rabbit heart, like the human heart, has little capacity for non-neuronal uptake of MIBG, and consequently appears to be amore suitable model than rat to study neuronal uptake. Sixteen rabbits (mean weight: 2.5kg) were studied: 8 control and 8 pre-treated with metoprolol (0. lmmol/kg ip twice a day for one week). Initial myocardial uptake of MBBG (6MBq) was measured 30 rain after injection of the tracer. Rabbits were killed with an overdose of pentobarbitaI, their heart quickly removed, dissected and the radioactivity counted. Results (mean value + sd in %kg dose/g; left (LV) and right (RV) ventricles): LV RV Control (C) 5.60+0.74 4.42+0.75 Meloprolol (M) 3.94+1.27 3.09+1.00 p (Nest) 0.006 0.01 Plasma Norepinephrine (NE, pg/ml) remained unchanged and epinephrine (E) remained unchanged: NE-C= 245+55, NE-M= 231_+45 pdml and E-C= 18_+4, E-M= 19_+6 pg/ml, respectively. The significant decrease (30%) in myocardial MBBG uptake cannot be explained an increased release of norepinephrine, the release being reduced by/,Lblockade. The reduced MBBG uptake cannot be related to a decrease in coronary blood flow which has been show to be invariant after/3-blockade in awake animals. These results suggest an interaction between metoprolol and the norepinephrine uptake one carrier. The purpose of the study was to i d e n t i f y the relation of positive antimyosin scan to onset of symptoms of congestive heart f a i l u r e (CHF), myocardial f i b r o s i s (MF) and response to medical treatment including digoxin, ACE inh i b i t o r s and furosemide. Seventeen patients (pts, 13M/4F) 43\u00b112 yrs suffering from idiopathic cardiomyopathy diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy, underwent antimyosin scan, c l i n i c a l and hemodynamic evaluation and q u a n t i t a t ive estimation of the MF. In 9 pts (group A) the antimyosin uptake r a t i o in the cardiac and right lung regions (H/L) were >1.6 (2.01\u00b10.35) and in 8 pts (group B) <1.6, (1.43\u00b10.05,-p<0.005). The duration of heart f a i l u r e symptoms in group A was 30\u00b134 months (range, 1.5-108) and in group B, 18\u00b119 months (range, 4-62, p=NS). There was no c l i n i c a l or hemodynamic difference between the 2groups. The proportion of MF was 7.6\u00b15.3% in group A and 3.6\u00b12% in group B (p=NS). NYHA functional class was reduced by medical treatment by 1.5\u00b11.2 in group A vs 0.4\u00b10.5 in group B (p<O.05). There were 2 deaths in group B and none in group A. In conclusion, these data suggest that even long standing dilated cardiomyopathy might give a positive antimyosin imaging independent of the level of MF.

Several studies have shown a typical antibody uptake pattern, localized to a segment in case of myocardial infarction and diffuse accumulation in acute myocarditis. We detected the site of myocardial in ury secondary to a cardioversion with 100-300 j-s in 9 patients with atrial or ventrioular arrhythmic disorders suspected to suffer from myocarditis. Series of 1111n-AMAB images 24 hours before and 72 hours after DC cardioversion were obtained. In 6/9 patients AMAB images prior to DC cardioversion were positive. In 5/6 patients diffuse accumulation of AMAB in the myocardium was obtained, and the ongoing myocarditis was confirmed. The remaining 1/6 patient had regional accumulation of AMAB. In this patient and in one of the remaining 3/9 patient without significant AMAB accumulation ischemic coronary disease was diagnosed. In the latter patient AMAB accumulation in the apical segment of the myocardium 72 hours after DC cardioversion was registered. In a patient with myocarditis the extension of AMAB accumulation was larger after DC cardioversion. The remaining 2/9 patients showed negative AMAB accumulation prior and after DC cardioversion. In these patients myocarditis and ischemic coronary disease was excluded. The arrhythmia was suggested to be due to valvular disease. We conclude that mln-antimyosin scintigraphy is a valuable tool for diagnosis myocarditis, and can be use to detect additional myocardial injury secondary to DC eardioversbn. No significant additional myocardial injury after direct current cardioversion with energy less than 300 J+ could be observed. Small additional myocardial injury after 300 J+ DC cardioversion could be expected in patients with ongoing myocardial in ury due to primarily myocardial disease. The distribution of AMAB-acoumulation with typical site and Iocalisation can be used to differentiate whether the necrosis is induced by ischemio coronary disease or it is secondary to a myocardial disease.",

With a continuous sampling technique, arterial (A) and coronary sinus (CS) blood was collected for the determination of HDA and 123I and to measure myocardial extraction of glucose (6.1 \u00b1 15.4 ~mol/min), lactate (10.6 \u00b112.4 Mmol/min), FA (22.7 \u00b1 63 Mmol/min), and oxygen (589 \u00b1 196 ~mol/min).

We consider that Fc-RVEF calculated by this method is less influenced by TR and could be useful in c l i n i c a l practice. The use of doxorubicin (DXR) is limited by their important cardiotoxicity. In a previous study, we observed simultaneous alterations of systolic and diastolic parameters one month after the end of the chemotherapy. The purpose of the study was to determine the evolution of these alterations. In a prospective study, twenty-three patients with a mean age of 51 + 13 years, without cardiac disease were studied before chemotherapy, one and three months after the end of the chemotherapy (mean dose 233 + 101 mg/m2). By gated radionuclide angiography we determined : the RR interval (RR), the ejection fraction (EF), the peak ejection rate (PER), the peak filling rate (PFR) (expressed in end diastolic volume per second : EDV/see), and the ratio PFR/PEK. Ambulatory left ventricular (LV) function monitor (Vest) has expanded the diagnostic potential of exercise le~sting in the evaluation of patients with cardiac diseases. To evaluate LV response during exercise, 20 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DC) (5 patients with idiopathic DC, group A, and 15 patients with post-necrotic DC, group B) underwent cardiopulmonary bicycle exercise testing with continuous monitoring of LV function. In both groups LV function was continuously monitored by Vest under resting conditions (RC), at anaerobic threshold (point on nonlinear increase in ventilation relative to oxygen uptake) (AT), and at peak oxygen uptake (VO2). VO2 was measured under RC and during exercise using an Aerobic Processor (MGC 2001) . End diastolic volume (EDV) was expressed as percent of the value at the beginning of the study and end systolic volume (ESV) was expressed relative to EDV. In both groups heart rate (HR) and EDV significantly (all p<0.01) increased at AT and at peak VO2 compared to RC. In group A, ESV did not change from RC (65+12%) to AT (70-+14%), while it significantly (p<0.01) increased from RC to peak VO2 (74+13%). In group B, ESV significantly (0.01) increased from RC (62+13%) to AT (69-!-_14%) and peak VO2 (74+14%). In group A, ejection fraction (EF) did not change from RC (33_+10%) to both AT (32:t9%) and peak VO2 (32_-+9%). In group B, EF did not change from RC (35+12%) to AT (35+10%), while it significantly (p<0.01) decreased at peak VO2 (32_+10%). In conclusion, exercise-induced LV function deterioration is more evident in patients with post-necrotic DC compared to patients with idiopathic DC. Vest allows a better understanding of functional responses during cardiopulmonary exercise and may be useful to evaluate the different behavior of LV function in patients with idiopathic and post-necrotic DC.

This study examines the relation between the C/M ratio and the LV ejection fraction (EF); furthermore the influence of T1-201 activity in blood, myocardial T1-201 uptake and LV size on the C/M ratio was determined. Twelve patients (9 with previous infarction) underwent T1-201 SPECT at rest and angiography. To calculate C/M ratios, 2x2 pixel ROIs were placed in the center of the LV cavity and on the myocardium with the highest T1-201 activity. Venous blood samples were drawn at the start of SPECT imaging to measure \"1\"1-201 activity; LV diameter (as a measure of LV size), extent and mean severity of perfusion defects were determined from SPECT images. Multiple regression was used to delineate which of these factors contributed significantly to the C/M ratio. EF varied from 13 to 80%.

It has been described that image quality of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is poor in patients with diabetes mellitus. In the present study we investigated the image quality of FDG SPECT studies during hyperinsulinemie euglyeemic clamping in 10 patients (pts) with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) and in 10 pts with CAD and diabetes mellitus type II (DM H). Levels of lactate (LA in retool/l), free fatty acids (FFA in mmol/1), glucose (GL in mmol/1) and insulin (INS in mU/l) were measured at the start and after 1 hour of clamping. The image quality was expressed by the myocardium-to-blood-pool (M/B) activity ratio (determined from short-axis slices Baseline levels of GL and FFA were significantly higher in the DM H group. One hour clamping increased INS levels significantly in both groups, and decreased FFA levels significantly in both groups but FFA levels remained higher in DM II pts, possible due to a relative insulin resistance. Also GL remained higher in DM H pts. Despite higher FFA levels image quality was not significantly lower in DM H pts. Thus, hyperinsulinemic glucose clamping may be advocated in DM II pts because it results in an image quality comparable to that of non-DM II pts. The use of 1231-16-Iodo-3 methyl hexadecanoic acid (IMHA) has been developped in order to evaluate the residual myocardial viability after a myocardial infarction. The best time for imaging is a matter of discussion. The aim of this study is to compare the relative myocardial distribution on IMHA S.P.E.C.T. 15 minutes and 45 minutes post intravenous injection. Eleven patients were studied after a myocardial infarction. In each patient, S.P.E.C.T.was obtained 15 and 45 minutes after injection of 148 MBq of IMHA at rest. Thallium S.P.E.C.T. was also obtained on a separate day at stress, redistribution and reinjection. Nine segments were quantitatively analysed by two observers on each tomogram set. The myocardial uptake was expressed as a percentage of the segment with the higher uptake. The uptake of IMHA was calculated in three groups of regions according to their uptake of thallium at reinjection (<60%, 60% -80%, >80% ). IMI-I uptake in the three groups was as follow :",

Parameters of 99mTc-HIDA transport rate were evaluated on timeactivity curves in a liver region of interest. The study was based on the presumption that changes in extraction of radioactive pharmaceutical /RP/~ by the liver and thus the shape of liver curve at DHbSc in the PPH patients with intact liver parenehyma correlate with changes of blood flow in the liver. This presumption was verified experimentally in dogs before and after artificial induction of PPH, and in the group of 23 PPH patients with either spontaneously developed collaterals or established portosystemic /PS/ shunt. In animal experiment% the curves of PPH-induced dogs showed a delayed RP transport. Similar liver curve pattern was observed in PPH patients with spontaneously developed collaterals. In patients with PS shunt the pattern of liver curves was close to normal values. The results obtained allow to conclude that patients with PS shunt have a better liver perfusion than patients with spontaneously developed collaterals. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy seems to be a suitable indirect marker of the state of liver perfusion in patienst with PPH. It allows the follow-up of the disease and selection of adequate therapy. ",

A high correlation was found between all biochemical liver tests (p<O.OOOf). The correlation between HLU and ICG was comparable high (rho=0.68, p< 0.0001).

Noninvasive 13C-acetate breath test for measuring gastric emptying: validation by simultaneous 99mTc-functional scintigraphy and 13CO 2breath test in dual isotope technique Aim: 13C-acetate is a substrate with a low molecular weight which is rapidly absorbed and metabolized to 13CO 2 at once being emptied from the stomach. The 13C-acetate breath test should be validated by comparison to an established scintigraphic method (99mTc-radiolabeled test meal as the gold standard) for determing gastric emptying time of liquids. Method: 22 patients (14 men and 6 women) underwent gastric emptying studies for medical indications and received a standard test meal ( 60 grams of rolled oats in 75 ml milk) containing 150 mg of the non radioactive 13Cacetate and 45 MBq of Technetium-99m labeled human albumin colloids [Soloo Nanocoll, Biomedica, DOsseldorf] . Breath samples were collected before (baseline) and after receiving the test meal at 10 minutes intervals for four hours.The samples were analysed by isotope ratio mass sDectrometry. The results were expressed as delta over baseline. The 13C02 elimination was determined as percentage of the total 13C dose administered. The gastric emptying time (half time=t 1/2) of the radiolabeled human albumin colloids was obtained by gamma camera imaging with online computer system.",

In conslusion: 1) H2-antagonist which are K + -H + pomp inhibitors may increase gastric uptake of TI-201. 2) Significantly increased gastric uptake of TI-201 may be due to increased blood flow to the gastric mucosa, and/or related to intracelluler homeostatic mechanisms which try to balance the intracellular K + content. 3) H 2antagonist use may be suspected, if significantly increased gastric uptake of TI-201 is seen during myocardial SPECT. The Se75-HCAT test is a well established procedure to study ileal absorption of fatty acids. The aim of this work was to evaluate the usefulness of the method in selecting treatment of patients with diarrhoeic syndrome. We retrospectively reviewed 17 test done in patients with diarrhoeic syndrome including 6 patients who have undergone ileal resection by crohn's disease. Procedure: A capsule containing 10 ~ci of Se75-HCAT was administered and the percentage of abdominal retained activity (ARA) was measured at 4 and 7 days using a collimated gammacamera. Normal values of ARA were > 25 % and > 15 % at 4th and 7th days respectively. Results: 1) ileal resection: All patients showed a very diminished abdominal retention at 4 and 7 days ( values ranging from 0 to 3 %). Two of them were treated with cholesteramine and reduced the number of depositions to 1-2/day. 3 out of the 4 remaining untreated patients did not show any change in their voiding frequency. 2) diarrhoeic syndrome: 6 out of the 11 patients showed a marked decrease of Se 75 abdominal retention at 7 days p.a. (range: 0-8 %). Four of them were treated with cholestiramine and reduced the voiding frequency to 1-3 times/day. The other two patients improved with diet. In the remaining 5 patients with normal ARA, reduction of voiding frequency was obtained eithe~ by diet and methylcellulose treatment or was selflimited. In summary: Though the short number of patients studied it seems that patients with diarrhoea and abnormal Se75-HCAT test should be treated with cholesteramine, while if the test is normal other treatment should be looked for. The aim of the work was to study the clinical usefulness of lllIn-IgG in diagnosis and in evaluating the extension of IBD. 15 patients (8 males), mean age 46.8 years have been studied. IED was suspected in all cases and diagnosis was obtained by endoscopy and/or surgery. About 1 mCi of 111In-Human plyclonal-IgG and 5 mCi of 99mTc-HMPAO labeled autologous leucocytes was simultaneous administered to all patients, subsequently abdominal and caudo-craneal scans were obtained at 30 min, 3-4 h and 18-24 h p.i. Images were evaluated by 2 independent observers knowing only the clinical suspicion of IBD. In 10 patients IBD was diagnosed. All showed a positive leucocyte scan and only 7 were positive in the IgG scan. In the remaining 5 patients, in whom IBD was discarded, both IgG and leucocyte scans were normal. Sensitivity and specificity were 100 % for leucocytes and 70 and 100 % respectively for IgG. Concerning extension of the disease, the leucocyte scan localized 21 involved segments while only 9 were identified by the IgG (all were also seen in the leucocyte scan). The activity in the involved segments was always lower in the IgG scan. In conclusion: lUIn-IgG seems to be a valuable, but less 99~ HMPAO sensitive method for the diagnosis of IBD than Tcleucocytes. The method may be use full when leucocyte labeling is not avaliable or to avoid blood handling in AIDS, ... Nevertheless it does not seem accurate accurate to evaluate the extension of the disease.

Therefore 3PBS may p r e d i c t the p r o g n o s i s as well as provide the useful information r e g a r d i n g the p a t h o p h y s i ological and clinical evaluation of RSD. From the literature the standard 3-phase scintigraphy of aseptic hip neerosis is known for rather high sensitivity, yet very low specificity and therefore also low reliability. Since we have been performing the modified examination 3T calculation and SPECT for some years~ we tried to find out in a retrospective study the amount of contribution of such modifies study to the reliability of examination. Material and methods:Our study involved 135pts with scintigraphye diagnosis of aseptic hip necrosis and 97pts without symptoms of aseptic necrosis. All pts underwent a 3-phase sointigraphy of hips with 3T calculation from the curve of first dynamic phase as well as SPECT of hips. In the patients with aseptic hip necrosis the process was verified. The calculated sensitivity amounts to 99.3%, specificity 98% and reliability 98.9%.By applying SPECT, we could exactly localize aseptic hip necrosis. Conclusion:The obtained results of quantitative analysis of relative perfusion in the artery phase (3T) evidence somewhat increased sensitivity, high specificity of examination which allows highly reliable diagnosis of aseptic hip necrosis. SPECT examination of hips performed in addition, however, allows exact localization of the process.",

BS realized in the initial evaluation of the disease (reference document) and in the pts with known bone metastases were not included. In 74 asymptomatic pts, 28 BS were normal, 42 corresponded to a benign bone disease (BBD) and & were doubtful (M?). BS were motivated by bone pain and/or signs of disease progression (local recidive, increase of CA 15-3 or visceral metastases) in 44 pts. Seven BS were normal, 20 corresponded to BBD, 9 to metastases and 8 to M? (i with doubtful NMR and 7 with no further examination). These results show that no systematic BS led to the discovery of proven bone metastases. Further evaluation of the four doubtful cases is necessary before concluding if systematic BS in breast cancer follow-up is clinically useful (and able to allow early detection of bone metastases).",

This antibody cressreacts with myosin in skeletal muscle and has been used for detection of lesions in patients with rhabdomyolysis and polymyositis. We used this method on 7 patients with Becker type muscular dystrophy with a diagnosis based on DNA deletion and/or dystrophin staining. In 6 patients weak to moderate uptake of antimyosin antibody was detected in the calves and in some patients also in the thighs and upper extremities. In 6 patients with non-X-chromosomal dystrophy uptake was recorded in the calves and in 4 patients also in the upper extremities. In dystrophy patients MRI findings were usually more prominent in the thighs, whereas in the calves the antimyesin findings were relatively stronger. This discrepancy is probably due to the better preserved muscle bulk in the calves, showing pseudohypertrophy, whereas in the thighs muscle tissue has been replaced by fat and connective tissue. In Becker dystrophy the basic defect is an abnormal structure of dystrophin, a cytoskeletal protein providing membrane integrity, whereas in non-X-chromosomal dystrophies the basic defect is unknown.

In this study we describe our preliminary results comparing conventional bone scan (BS) and bone marrow scintigraphy (BMS) in detection of skeletal metastases in the follow up of breast cancer patients (pts). We have investigated eleven pts with histologically confirmed breast cancer. Whole-body scans and single planar scans were obtained 3-6 hours post injection of a single dose of 0,25 -0,50 mg murine MAb BW 250/183 (Behringwerke AG) labeled with 370-555 MBq of Tc-99m. Conventional BS using Tc-99m MDP and BMS were performed within an interval of 4 weeks. Some of BS and BMS lesions were confirmed by standard x-my procedures. BS showed bone metastases in 7 pts. BMS detected BM involvement in 8 pts, two of them with negative BS. In 6 pts with positive BS x-ray procedures confirmed osteotysis. One of these pts had negative BMS because the lesion was situated in the proximal part of the left ulna, which normally does not contain BM. Ten lesions shown on BMS were not present on BS. In l pt with multiple bone metastases a diffuse reduction of bone uptake on BMS associated with an intense liver and normal spleen uptake was observed. We conclude that BMS with antigranulocye MAb plays an important role in the detection of BM involvement in pts with breast cancer. BMS seems to have a comparable sensitivity to the BS and these two procedures could be complementary. ",

In order to further elucidate the role of the bifunctional chelating agent DTPA, we studied the behavior of In-111-C-14-DTPA-IgG-1-123 in rats with a focal infection. C-14-DTPA-conjugated IgG was labeled with In-111 via citrate transchelation. In-l11-C-14-DTPA-IgG was labeled with 1-123 according to the BoRon-Hunter procedure. Labeled IgG was purified by gel filtration. HPLC was performed as quality control. Young Wistar rats with a Staph. Aur. infection of the left calf muscle were i.v. injected with 0.2 ml of a solution containing 0.45 MBq In-111, 50 KBq C-14, and 1.8 MBq 1-123 labeled to 2.5 mg IgG. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 6, 24, arid 48 hr. p.i.. Activity uptake was determined for plasma, urine, abscess, and various other tissues. Averages + SD were calculated for groups of five rats. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed by HPLC. The radiochemical purity of the IgG-preparation was > 95%. The DTPA:IgG ratio was 3:1. In all tissues tested, except for the lung, the uptake of both In-111 and C-14-DTPA was much higher than the 1-123-1gG uptake (48 hr p.i., liver: In-ll 1: 1.1+0.1; DTPA: 1.0+0.1; IgG: 0.35+0.03; abscess: In-111: 1.1+0.1; DTPA: 1.7+0.2; IgG: 0.7+0.1 (%ID/g+SD)). The abscess uptake of C-14-DTPA was significantly higher than that of In-111 (p<0.01). The 1-123 data were similar to the C-14-1gG data from a previous experiment in the same model. In plasma release of In-111 from IgG was observed over time, whereas DTPA remained conjugated to IgG. A small amount of In-111 in plasma was found to be transchelated to a substance with a molecular weight slightly smaller than that of IgG. Both In-111 and DTPA appear to dissociate from IgG. In abscesses the DTPA uptake is significantly higher than the In-111 uptake. ",

In 24 patients SPECT was additionally performed after 24 hours. The final diagnosis was established by histology, blood cultures, routine laboratory methods, and radiology including MRI. Fifty percent of the patients had infectious, 14 % autoimmune, I0 % malignant, and 15 % other diseases. In Ii % the etiology of the fever remained unknown. A total of 16 true positive infectious foci was found (only hot spots were considered), 5 skeletal, 5 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 2 cranial, and 2 in other locations. Three false positive findings originated from necrotising colitis, uremic colitis, and a mediastinal mixed tumour. There were 9 false negative foci in patients with endocarditis, pneumonia, abdominal abscess, and osteomyelitis of the central skeleton. Sensitivity and specificity of the AgAb scintigraphy regarding infectious disease (prevalence 44 %) amounted to 64 % and 89 %, respectively, positive and negative predictive values were 84 % and 70 %, respectively. In conclusion, AgAb scintigraphy is an important diagnostic tool in proving or excluding an infectious etiology of FUO. Radiolaballed polyclonal human immunoglobulin G (HIG) has been recognized as a reliable modality for localization of infection and inflammation.

The results were correlated to anti-granulocytesantibody-uptake, sonography, CT and MRT. The scintigraphy with nanocolloids is a proven method in detecting chronic septic processes. In acute cases with wound trauma enlarged nanocolloid uptake was seen in the surrounding bone tissue due to the unspecific inflammation, so that infection cannot be exactly localized and differentiated to early postoperative alterations. In these cases the anti-granulocyte-soan showed in the planar and SPECT images a high concentration of antigranulocyte-AB so that localization and identification of the infection even in the SPECT-slices was better than in the nanocolloid scans.

CT scans were obtained through the use of intravenous contrast material in the usual way. Signs in the LS of control patients were as follows: activity irregularity, biffed sternum and diffuse, increased lung uptake of leukocytes. CT scans of the control group showed focal edema, focal hematoma and moderate sternal abnormalities. In one control patient the CT proved positive. In 11 cases with clinically verified infection 9 proved positive on LS and 8 on CT. LS was positive in cases with either a superficial or a deep process.

But it is believed that further investigntions are indicated in order to evaluate the definite role and prognostic value of Tc-99m HIG in infections sad inflanmations. Since the ~gnosis of pulmonary embolism is based cn the ccmparison of scintigraphic images of ventilation and perfusion we studied the usefulness of a software which autnmatically generates the images of the differences between ventilation and perfusion scan images. 88 patients (45 males, 43 females) mean age 60 years were examined. All of them had a lung scan ventilation and a lung scan perfusion with 4 views (anterior, posterior, left and right oblique posterior). The lung ventilation scan is realised with Technegas then the lung perfusion with 240 MBq 99m Tc labelled microspheres. According to the PIC~D classification, 26 patients were considered ~Drmal, 36 patients had a low probability of pulmonary embolism, 26 patients had a high probability. Images oontained I00 000 counts for the ventilation and 400 000 for the perfusion. We ~ regicns of interest on the 4 ventilation images. After an automatic geometric and gray level registration, images of si~ificant differences were obtained between ventilation and perfusion images. These images did not modifie the diagnosis obtained with original images. However, this technique could be useful in the objective cc~parison of repeated perfusion scan. This study prospectively evaluated the effect of the consistent use of a previously described anatomical lung segment chart on the interpretation of lung scans. Simultaneous perfusion-ventilation lung scintigraphy was performed in 221 consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism using 99m-Tc macro-aggregates of albumin and 81m-Krypton gas. Lung scans were immediately reported as normal, high probability or non-diagnostic, with the use of an anatomical lung segment chart. After at least six months, blinded lung scans were randomly read by a panel of nuclear medicine physicians. Initial lung scan reports were classified as normal, high probability, and non-diagnostic in 64, 63, and 94 patients, respectively. Overall observer disagreement was 5.9% (95% CI 3.2%-9.8%), while this was 7.8%, 3.2% and 7.9% for lung scans that were initially reported as normal, non-diagnostic and high probability, respectively. Reclassification consisted of normal to non-diagnostic (5), non-diagnostic to normal (1), non-diagnostic to high probability (2), and high probability to non-diagnostic scan results (5). From literature, overall disagreement of 20% was expected if no chart had been used (Thromb Haemostas 1992;68:245-249). In conclusion, this study confirms that the consistent use of a lung segment chart reduces observer disagreement in the reporting of lung scans. Routine reporting by a panel should be considered to further improve patient management. G.Rubini, D.Rubini, L.Colonna*, F.Lauriero, F.Bovenzi*, C.D'Agostino*, A.D'Addabbo.",

It has been suggested that peptide activation in irradiated areas may be involved in the pathogenesis of lung injury. Therefore, we have explored the feasibility of nlln-pentetreotide scintigraphy in detecting radiation pneumonitis. Seven patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum for lymphoma or to the internal mammary nodes for breast carcinoma were investigated. Planar and SPECT images were performed 24 hours after administration of 110 MBq mln-pentetreotide. The degree of lung uptake was visually evaluated. The scintigraphic findings were correlated with the radiation field (RT-field) and compared with ventilation and perfusion lung scans (V-Q) obtained in the same week. mIn-pentetreotide was strongly positive in 4 of 6 symptomatic patients examined 2-5 months after irradiation; one of the three was receiving steroid therapy but without clinical response. In 2 other patients with good clinical response, mln-pentetreotide, performed a few weeks after starting steroid therapy, was weakly positive and negative respectively. In one asymptomatic patient, investigated t month after radiotherapy, mln-pentetreotide was negative. V-Q scans showed abnormalities in all symptomatic patients. However, the nlIn-pentetreotide images we obtained so far suggest a better delineation of lung injury than standard V-Q scans. This was helpful in one case of internal mammary chain irradiation in which the V-Q lung scan was not conclusive for diagnosis, mln-pentetreotide uptake was observed only in lung areas included in the RT-field. It is concluded that mln-pentetreotide appears to be sensitive in detecting radiation pneumonitis. Uptake, which may reflect radiation-induced activation of somatostatin receptors in injuried lung areas, may be influenced by steroid therapy, nqn-pentetreotide may have a role in the differential diagnosis in patients with complaints after RT and in the assessment of response to steroid therapy.",

Also, lung clearances studies have been obtained with Perteclmegas (PER), a technical modification of Technegas produced by combustion in a 97% argon mad 3% oxygen atmosphere. We report the results of AERO and PER studies for evaluating the alterations of lung epithelial permeability in HIV (+) patients with Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP). This retrospective study included 8 HIV (+) drug addicts patients with PCP confirmed by induced sputum or broncoalveolar lavage. For ventilation studies, patients were placed supine over a gammacamera with a high sensitivity collimator. The PER study was acquired after 3-5 inspirations and the pulmonary activity was recorded in 64 x 64 matrix during 25 minutes (1 frame/30 seconds). The AERO was performed the same day at the same conditions as PER study but the inhalation period was 2-3 minutes. Time/activity curves were obtained for each whole lung; they were corrected for a background activity area drawn over the interrenal region. T50 of lung clearance was calculated as follows: a fit of the final 7 minutes was performed to estimate the slower exponential; this curve was subtracted from the original curve and then a single exponential fit of the rapid component was performed. Final T50 was the mean of two lung regions. All clearance studies showed biphasie curves. T50 ranged from 2.3 to 5.3 minutes (mean 3.36 + 0.87 minutes) for PER; in the AERO study, the T50 range was 2.80 to 5.80 minutes (mean 4.26 _+ 1.2 minutes). Ventilation studies with PER and AERO showed similar results to evaluate lung epithelial permeability in PCP. The PER study is easier to perform because the inhalation period is shorter. In an attempt to provide an index for management of AIDS patients with clinical suspicion of PCP, larger patients population are needed to compare both ventilation procedures. 76 DTPA clearances were performed on 10 patients with bipulmonary lung transplantation and 2 patients with monopulmonary lung transplantation, The pulmonary Tc99m-DTPA clearance rate was calculated from negative slope of the regression line and expressed in term of percentage of the radioactivity par minute (%/rain). Using transbronchial biopsy samples, three groups were studied: Normal lung histology (42 values), lung rejection pattern: grade I (20 values), grade II or III (14 values). The optimal value of DTPA clearance in terms of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of lung rejection was determined by a receiver operating curve analysis (R.O.C.). A threshold of DTPA clearance of 2,2%/rain was both sensitive (76%) and specific (6t%) for the diagnosis of lung rejection (grade I to Ill). A threshold of DTPA clearance of 2,5%/minwas both sensitive (72%) and specific (60%) for the diagnosis of lung rejection (grade II or III). An increase of 20% of DPTA clearance between two determinations was both sensitive (83%) and specific (83%) for the diagnosis of aggravation ( Normal to grade I,II or Ill; or grade I to grade II or III). These results suggest that DTPA clearance monitoring appear to be a good non invasive approach for the detection of lung rejection. ",

Anti-inflammatory treatment of asthma using steroid may decrease the airway permeability, This study evaluated the effect of inhalation of steroid on lung permeability in asthmatics by measuring the clearance of Tc-99m DTPA aerosol from the alveolar to vascular space, Twenty patients (15 males, 5 females; age range 18-75 years) were studied in the supine position with their back against a gamma camera after breathing Tc-ggm DTPA for 3 mins and lung images were obtained every one min for 30 mins, A computer routine was used to calculate clearance half time (T I/2) in min. Only data on the right lung was used to analyze clearance because of interference from stomach activity on the l e f t side. The base line lung permeability study was performed before treatment with inhalation of 50 mcg beclomesasone dipropionate four times daily for one week, then the study was repeated. Our results revealed that 13 of 21 (65%) patients had improved lung permeability after treatment with steroid although no improvement was noted in the rest 8 cases.",

Consequently, aortic surgery may result in lung injury, pulmonary edema and the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it is unknown if patients undergoing aortic surgery have an increase of pulmonary microvascular permeability. We assessed lung microvasculsr permeability prior to and after aortic surgery in 11 patients. The kinetics of intravenously injected nlIndium chloride ( 3.7 MBq), assumed to bind to circulating transferrin, and labeled red blood cells (~Tc, 11 MBq) were recorded in blood and over the left lung. A leak index was calculated from the ratio of IHIn/~Tc count rates in the lung and in blood, representing the transvascular transport rate of UlIn. Patients were studied before surgery and in the acute phase after surgery at the intensive care. Furthermore, we measured circulating inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor u (TNFa) and elsstaseul-antitrypsin complex (elastase-~l-AT) levels in 8 patients. The mean (\u00b1 SD} leak index increased from 0.66\u00b10.76 10 -3 . min \"I before to 6.5\u00b18.6 i03.min 4 after surgery (p<0.05).

We conclude that aortic surgery results in increased microvascular permeability of the lung. Increased permeability is not associated with significant TNFu release but is associated with increased levels of the neutrophil enzyme elastase-ul-AT.",

The alveolar integrity (AI) in 28 male patients (ages: 65-76 years, stopping smoking for I year at least) with pulmonary emphysema (PE) diagnosed by chest X-raywas measured by Tc-99m DTPA and HMPAO raaloaeroso~ innaJazion lung scinziBrapny (DTPA and HMPAO) using a commercial lung aerosol delwery umt (AERO/VENT, MEDI-NUCLEAR). The degree of AI damage in PE was presented as the slope (%/min) of the time-activity curve from the dynamic right lung imagings (I frame/1 min for 30 min over the posterior view of the chest). The AI of PE patients were compared with the AI of 24 normal controls (ages: 63-78 years z without smoking history, with normal chest X-ray and pulmonary functlon test * There was no significantly statistical difference between the normal controls and PE patients. However, AI in PE patients with abnormal DLCO was more severely damaged as was presented by a slope which was higher than those with normal DLCO in both DTPA and HMPAOand higher than those in normal controls in HMPAO (P < 0,05, Mann-Whitney U test). We found that (I) lipophilic HMPAO (transferrlng cell mambranoes) was slower than hydrophilic OTPA (transferring intracellular pores) in clearing aerosols in all of the cases in lungs, which suggests that at least two different mechanisms in lungs were at work, (2) The slopes, especially that in HMPAO, in PE patients with abnormal DLCO were higher than those in other patients. This meant that the AI damage in PE developed majorly in the lipophilic part of the alveoli. With the bolus inhalation technique small volumes of radioactively labeled aerosols are inhaled and the particles were deposited in the airways of the tracheobronchial tree. The boluses were produced with a fast operating magneto-pneumatic valve system and can be injected at any preselected time during a clean air inhalation. Injecting the boluses near the end of a 1000 cm 3inhalation the particles cannot penetrate into the peripheral regions of the lungs. They will be deposited in the airways during a period of breathholding (between 1.7s and 20s). Five healthy human subjects volunteered in 20 investigations. Tc-99m and In-Ill labeled iron oxide aerosol particles with aerodynamic diameters of 2.8 -3.5 #m were produced with a spinning disc generator. The particles were monodisperse, nonhygroscopic and insoluble. The distribution of the deposited particles in the lungs was detected with a digital gamma camera in two of the 5 subjects. The pictures showed a very central deposition after bolus inhalations in volumetric lung depths (VL) between 50 and 75 cm 3. Retention of the deposited radioactive particles was measured with a high sensitive collimated scintillation counter during the next 120 hours after inhalation. It was found that 55(+7)% of the particles which were deposited in shallow lung regions (VL between 30 and 85 cm 3) were not cleared within the next 24 hours. This is in contrast to the assumption, that all particles from the tracheobronchial region are cleared within a day by the mucociliary system. The fast cleared particles were transported out of the lungs with a halftime of 2.4 (+ 1.6) hours. Mucociliary clearance depends in part on tracheobronchial mucus transport (TMT). A reduced TMT may result in clinical problems in postoperative patients. The purpose of this study is to define TMT in patients still during anesthesia under various dosages of theophylline.",

The determination of plasma renal clearance using one or two blood samples has now gained wide acceptance in nuclear medicine departments. Results provided by such methods are greatly dependent on the good quality of technical parameters (activity totally injected,exact dilution).We present here a simple method based on scintigraphic data acquired before blood sampling in renal transplanted patients, that could be used to validate the quality of clearance measurements. On renal .scintigraphy, an index of renal function (I.R.F.) is calculated as the ratio of renal uptake (between 1 and 2 rain after injection) divided by the mean value of background counts near the renal area. No depth correction is made. We performed MAG-3 renal scintigraphy in 67 transplanted patients (44 men 23 women aged 18-66 years). The IR.F. was calculated and MAG-3 clearance obtained by MULLER method with a single plasma sample at 60 rain.The range of the clearances was 31-225 ml/min. A good linear regression was found between MAG-3 plasm,a clearance and the I.P,~F with a correlation coefficient of 0.76(p<10 -> ;SF~ = 29.8 ml/min). The usefulness of the IR.F. was observed in 2 transplanted patients with unexpected very high plasma clearance determinations ( 268 and 301 ml/min) suggesting technical problems as extravasation of injected activity or wrong dilutions. Corresponding I.R.F. values gave a very good agreement between predicted and experimental clearance values, eliminating the possibility of such mistakes. This method using only scintigraphie data does not depend on plasma counting and is especially useful when an accurate clearance measurement cannot be obtained due to a technical failure.",

The data indicate that even with a state-ofthe-art SPECT technique sensitivity in diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease is higher using measurements of glucose metabolism when compared to perfusion. rCBF CHANGES IN EPILEPSY USING 99mTc-ECD: A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies play an important role in the presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. In the localization of epileptic foci the highest efficacy has been described for the combination of ictal and interictal studies. The application of the new rCBF tracer 99mTc-ECD in this indication is still under evaluation. The aim of present study was the quantitative evaluation of 99mTc-ECD uptake changes in ictal and interictal phases of focal epilepsy. In 8 patients ictal and interictal rCBF SPECT studies using 99mTc-ECD with a high resolution SPECT system (CERASPECT) were performed. In 5 patients the ictal SPECT study was done twice (41_+8 rain delay) to measure the tracer washout from hyperperfused areas. The SPECT data were analysed by a standard automatic quantification method, in 10 cantomeatal (4 under, 6 over the thalamus; 24 ROIs/ 1 ring /slice) and in 4 (under the thalamus, 2 x 24 ROIs/2 rings/slice) horizontal orinted transversal slices. Corresponding to the visual evaluation the quantitative analysis showed a significantly increased tracer uptake at the epileptic focus in the ictal study compared to the interictal study (asymmetry index: 1.23_+0.08 and 0,88-+0.03 respectively). In patients with repeated SPECT studies the washout from the hyperperfused areas was lower than from the total brain (8.9-+2.3% and 13.5-+1.6% respectively p<0.01). Compared to cortical areas the difference was statistically not significant. We concluded: 1. 99mTc-ECD SPECT is able to detect rCBF changes between ictal and interictal stages in epilepsy. 2. There is no loss of contrast (focus / other brain region) to be expected with time elapsed in the ictal study. ",

If the vision of the amblyoplc eye is supressed and the sound eye is used to generate image in amblyopic patients, stimulation of contrlateral cortex of the sound eye should be observed when both eyes are open. Brain SPECT with single dedector rotating gamma camera (GE XR/T) was performed twice with the administration of 555 MBq Tc 99m HMPAO, one in basal conditions and the other following visual activation by staring at a blue spot on a pink background for 6 minutes. 2 pixel slices parallel to the orbltomeatal line were reconstructed using Butterworth filter. Activation of the brain regions were evaluated visually. In all patients, primary visual cortex (PVC) showed increased uptake after stimulation. 6 of the patients showed temporal and 5 of the patients showed frontal activation contrlateral to the sound eye. This study suggested that amblyopic model is not the same with the one eye closed model.When two eyes are open, more complex mechanisms may be involved. And there may be the contribution of the amblyopic eye in temporal and frontal cortical stimulation, though its' Image is not fused with the image of the sound eye in PVC. In patients with Systemic Lupus Erithematosus (SLE) cerebrovascular involvement can be present up to 75% of cases. To evaluate the relation between perfusion defects and the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and lupic anticoagulant factor we have studied 14 SLE patients (13F, 1M mean age 32.4 years) with a disease duration ranging among 3.5-6.4 years. A brain perfusion SPET scan was performed after i.v. administration in resting conditions of 740 MBq of 99mTc-HMPAO using a dedicated device (CERASPECT, DSI, USA). SPET studies were acquired for 30 minutes and the images reconstructed using a Butterworth 2D filter and corrected for attenuation using Chang's method. The semiquantitative analysis (ratio between cerebral region/cerebellum) was performed on 10 transaxial slices 9.6 mm thick and the results were compared with those obtained from normal subjects sex and age matched. Cerebral perfusion abnormalities were observed in 9 patients (64%), mainly in the frontotemporal region, in one or both hemispheres. The lupic anticoagulant factor was positive in 3 patients (21%), alt with an history of multiple trombophlebitis and peripheral arteropathy: the corresponding SPET images were normal in 2 cases while in the third a perfusiori defect was evident in the right temporal region. Of the 5 patients (35%) positive for anticardiolipin IgM antibodies, only 2 had perfusion defects, both in the fronto-temporal regions. Eight patients (57%) had positive IgG: their SPET scans were normal in 3 cases, while perfusion defects were present in the other 5. In 4 patients (28%) both the antibodies were present and in one the lupic anticoagulant factor was also positive. The corresponding SPET studies were positive only in two cases. Our data confirm the involvement of the cerebral circulation in the SLE patients and the capability of brain perfuion SPET scans to detect them, while reduced cerebral perfusion does not seem to be correlated to the presence of antibodies, well-known risk factors for thrombosis.

There is a high incidence of Alzheimer's disease(AD) type dementia beyond age 35. Tc-99m HMPAO SPET brain perfusion imaging of 12 DS patients(age range 3 to 24 years) were performed and these images were compared to a greup cf i0 age matched controls inorder to define brain perfusion patterns in different ages and its reIation to AD type hypoperfusion pattern. SPET scans were acquired 15 minutes after i.v.injecticn of 185-555 MBq of Tc-HMPAO using a single head rotating gamma camera.Scans were interpreted both visually and quantitatively by drawing multiple mirrored regions on the cerebral hemispheres. A side to side asymmetry exceeding 10% between the mirrored regions were accepted to be abnormal.5 DS cases demonstrated normal brain perfusion, 3 cases showed frontal hypoperfusion, other 4 cases revealed right or left parietotemporooccipital (PTO) hypoperfusion with or without frontal hypofrontality, Briefly 7 out of 12 young DS cases without dementia symptoms revealed mostly frontal and/or PTO hypoperfusion. These findings suggest that DS subjects without dementia symptoms may show abnormal brain perfusion. Brain perfusion imaging in younger DS cases wi]l be useful in identifying baseline perfnsion state and may help to predict dementia earlier and in the assessment of the prognosis of the patients. The present study is part of a comparison between non-diabetic and IDDM subjects with respect to the brain energy metabolism. The regional uptake of ketone bodies in the human brain was investigated in four healthy, fasting volunteers. The regional time course of the tracer in the brain was measured by positron emission tomography (Scanditronix PC 2048-15B) during i0 min following a bolus injection of 400 MBq [l-llC]-~-hydroxybutyrate. The time course of the tracer in the arterial plasma was also measured. The plasma concentration of ~-hydroxybutyrate was 20 -90 pmol/ml. A three compartment model with three rate constants and blood volume as parameters was applied. No correction for possible losses of tracer was made. The average influx rate constant for ketone bodies into the brain was = 0.03 ml/g/min, i.e. about one third of the corresponding value for glucose. This estimate is comparatively insensitive to possible tracer losses (IIC-CO2) from the tissue. The uptake was largest in grey matter. The average distribution volume of ketone bodies was = 0.005 ml/g, indicating a very low concentration of ketone bodies in the brain, and about 1/20 of the corresponding value for glucose. Any correction for tracer losses tends to lower this estimate. The results show the feasibility of determining transport kinetics of ketone bodies with PET.",

NSE de-terminations were assayed with a solid phase IRMA (BYK-Sangtec-Diagnostica Germany) while eNCAM was measured with a solid phase RIA (Behringwerke AG). c r scanswere performed for correlation with the lesion size. Based on our results, we can conclude: a) CFS and BS concentrations of eNCAM and NSE reflect (i) the severity of the disease (IS) and (ii) the extent of brain damage, b) BS and CSF levels corrclate while c) repeated measurements can be used as prognostic tool of the ischcmic brain damage course; d) eNCAM appears to be more sensitive compared to NSE. Absolute values of ~erebellar uptake of Tc-99m HMPAO were obtained in 33 healthy volunteers and 13 patients, suffering from probable dementia of Alsheimer's type (DAT), by means of calibrated point sources used as external standard.

Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPET) brain scans, performed with 99mTcHMPAO, may be evaluated with visual and/or semiquantitative methods of regional analysis, which improve the image interpretation, but whose reproducibility must be carefully assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intra-and inter-observer reproducibility of 3 semiquantitative methods in two groups of patients. In the first group -8 patients: 2 normal (N), 4 with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and 2 with dementia (D) -the studies were acquired with a single head rotating gamma camera (Apex SP4HR Elscint, Israel). In the second group -10 patients: 2 N, 4 CVD, 4 D-a high resolution, brain-dedicated annular system (CERASPECT, DSI, USA) was used. On four selected brain slices, placed at standard levels above the cantomeatat (CM) reference plane (+ 2, 3, 5, 6 cm, respectively), one senior clinician and one first-year resident applied at both groups of patients three different sets of regions of interest (ROI), linearized to the cerebellum and consiting of: A) fixed -number and -size polygonal ROIs, B) multiple hand-drawn ROIs, and C) semiautomatic segmentation of a treshold-based, cortical ROI, plus manual definiton of deep grey matter (DGM) structures. One week later, the analysis was repeated. In both groups no significant intraobserver variation was found with any of the 3 methods. The cortical ROIs of both groups showed no difference when analyzed by the two observers with any method, while, in the first group of patients, DGM ROIs resulted significantly different (p< 0.005) between the 2 observers using method B and C. In the patients evaluated with the brain-dedicated camera no difference was evident for the DGM ROIs with all methods. The data suggest that, using a high resolution system, inter-indivual variability does not affect the measurement, while, at lower spatial resolution, the choice of the semiquantitative method becomes critical for the definiton of DGM ROIs.

According to this evalutations the BPI was determinated for 57 pts. suffering from various disturbances of cerebral perfusion. The radionuclide passage in the first minute after bolus injection of 750 MBq 9~Tc-HMPAO was monitored with a dual head large field camera positioned over both, brain and thoracal region using a rapid sequence of 2 frames/see. A graphical analysis of curve data obtained over aortic arch and whole brain as well as both hemispheres give the influx-constant (k,). To receive the BPI the ku -values were correct for individual ROI-values. Mathematically we can show that the graphically estimated ku is a product of a influx constant (which is nearly the same in different patients) and the part of cerebral blood flow from cardiac output. Results showed a closed correlation of calculated BPI with perfusion and the degree and number of perfusion disturbances supposed by an combination of results of physical examinations, SPECT, rentgenologic angiography, XCT and/or MRI. In patients without or with minimal disturbances of cerebral blood flow a negative correlation from BPI with age was seen. BPI-values obtained from a curve fit done between the 5.-15 s compared with those between 10.-20 s show a small reduction of BPI for later time points. This finding may be attributed to fast back diffusion. If a standardisation for individual conditions of acquisition is done, this technique can complete as a helpful adjunct routine SPECT studies in a quantitative manner and alows the quantification of brain perfusion enhancement aider injection of acetazolamide.

Coronal Slices were generated as input for a circumferential profile programme. Nine segments of four circumferential profiles on four equidistant transaxial slices were appropriately normalised in order to compare HMPAO and IMP distributions. Regions of interest were placed on the total brain in corresponding slices and the counts/pixel used in a comparison of the ratios of uptake from the two tracers, (IMP:HMPAO) for the norsal and later the stressed baboons. These uptake ratios, as well as the quality of the SPECT images, suggest better cerebral uptake of the IMP, and a lack of adequate agreement in the regional distributions of the two tracers for beth the normal and the acetazolamide ccmpromised animals. This finding would exclude a dual-isotope brain-stress test as proposed. This study was undertaken to determine the normal Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT pattern in adults.",

Imaging diagnostics in brain tumors normally means CT/MRI imaging. The aim of this study was to find out if there is an improvement by adding functional imaging such as PET and SPECT.Out of a group of 65 patients with brain tumors 49 were selected (17 high grade gliomas, 12 low grade gliomas, 14 meningeomas,6 metastases). SPECT: 130 MBq 201-Thallium and 600-750 MBq 99mTc-HMPAO respectively were injected. Data acqusition: 5min.p.i. a 360 \u00b0 study, 128x128 matrix, 64 frames (30sec.each) was aquired. The quantification was done in ROI technique. For thallium study a ratio tumor/normal tissue was used. PET:after overnight fasting 200 to 350MBq 18-FDG were injected. 30min.p.i. three emission scans ( 10 min.each) were acquired. For quantification ROI technique was used. All patients were provided with CT or MRI scans respectively and were given biopsy or surgery of the tumor. In high grade gliomas the thallium ratio was 1.5-2.9, in low grade gliomas 1.2-1.5 and in meningeomas 3.1-8.5 respectively. The perfusion study showed an increased uptake for vital tumor tissue in high grade gliomas (14/17). Low grade gliomas (9/12) showed a circle-enhancement with low central uptake (necrosis, cyste). In meningeomas the perfusion uptake declined dramatically. For glucose metabolism high grade gliomas (17/17) showed an increased uptake, whereas low grade gliomas had partly increased and partly severely decreased uptake values. Meningeomas showed a low uptake and metastasis differed from high to low uptake values. The different tumor types showed different patterns in perfusion, thalium uptake and glucose metabolism. The combina-tion of morphological and functional imaging can apparently increase the specificity of diagnosis. Especially glucose metabolism gives datas about the activity of important centers in the brain, usefull for the planning of surgery.

The quantification of the relative uptake of the radiopharmaceutical by the tumors yielded the following T/NT ratios: In conclusion. 1) -the use 1111n-Octreotide may be helpful in the preoperative differentiation of meningiomas from other brain tumors in respect to the high T/NT ratio obtained. 21 -In the remaining tumor types wNch were positively imaged the T/NT ratio did not show any significant differences between the different histologic types. An extract from wall of the bacterium Nocardia opaca prepared as disclosed in the German patent P 3510795 supplied by one of the authors (U.Ehrenfeld) was proved in former animal experiments as an immunomodulating substance. After administration of this preparation radiolabelled by In-111 or Tc-99m and in tracer amotlnts an elevated radioactivity uptake was observed at various sites of increases enzymatic activity as well as in Walker cacinsarcomas. Therefore, the reliability in diagnosing of different types of malignant tumors was studied by us. Planar imaging using a large field camera equipped with a MEHR collimator took place 3 hrs. pi. of the Tc-99m-labelled immunomodulatot completed by SPECT for doubtful cases. Images were evaluated by visual interpretation as well as in a semiquantitative manner. 105 male and female pts. were studied suffering fromfollowing types of primary maiignomas or metastases: breast cancer, sarcomas, malignant tumors of urogenital and gastrointestinal system, melanomas and neuroendocrine tumors. 23 lesions were proven histologically, whereas the remaining number of scintigraphic findings were confirmed by CT and MR/. Overall sensitivity of tumor detection was 0,97 % if cut off point was set at a uptake ratio of 1.30. The mean values of ratios differ from tumor species to species with the highest mean values for ratios of sarcomas. Advantageously, the diagnostic application of the Tc-99mlabelled IMM is not limited to a single tumor type but seems to be successfully in a broad range of different types of malignomas. Therefore, from clinical point of view the IMM seems to be suited to used for recognition of malignomas additionally to other well known tumor seeking agents. Further studies will be directed to consider the question of specificity. The aim of this study was to compare the biokinetic properties and imaging capabilities of an anti-CD7 antibody, using the 131I labeled complete lgG and F(ab')2-fragment and the 99mTc labeled Fab'-fragment in a nude mouse model. The CD7 molecule is a 40kD membrane protein, which is expressed by mature and immature T-lymphocytes. It is not expressed on a variety of non hematolymphatic humaal tissues. 29 nude mice with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CEM cell line; 0.75-3cm 3 turnour volume) were included. Scintigraphy was performed with a pinhole collimator (Siemens Basicam gamma camera, 15min/image) and data stored in a 256x256 matrix (Max Delta computer system). Whole body kinetics were calculated by ROI technique. The ratio turnout activity / whole body\" activity increased: for the complete antibody from 16% at 24h pi up to 93% I0 days pi, for the F(ab)2-fragment from 21% at 24 h pi up to 88% 10 days pi, for the Fab'fragment from 30% lh pi up to 40% 2h pi, which declined to 20% 72h pi.

Both effects can be explained by the more rapid whole body excretion of Fab'-fragments and their faster rate of extravasation. Presumably, there is an internalization of complete IgG and its F(ab')2fragment leading to stable tumour binding, whereas Fab'-fragments have lower affinity and no internalization takes place, leading to subsequent washout.

However, the findings are adequate to suggest that quantitative metabolic brain tumor imaging is feasible using high resolution SPECT with an I-123 labeled amino acid analog in order to visualized viable tumor. The aim of this study was to compare the visualization of brain tumors with Iodine-123-Methyl Tyrosine (I-123-MT) and Indium-lll-Octreotide (In-111-Oc). We used 1-123-MT (FZ-Seibersdorf), administering 222 MBq and planar images were performed 10min and lhr after application. In 5 pts SPECT images were performed too. Not earlier than 48hrs 244 MBq In-111-Oc (OctreoScan\u00ae, Mallincrodt) were injected and planar images 4 and 24 hrs after application performed, in 9 pts SPECT images were performed (4hrs p.appl.). A digital Anger camera was used for data acquisition and processing (APEX 409A, Elscint). A total of 12 pts (8male, 4 female; age ranging from 45-71 yrs) were investigated. Using a region of interest technique tumor-to-brain tissue ratios (T/BT) were calculated. Diagnosis of tumor was established by neurosurgical procedures. 6 pts with glioblastoma showed a high uptake with In-111-Oc (T/BT: 1.7+0.5) and also with 1-123-MT (T/BT: 1.5+0.4 (10') and 1.45+0.45 (lh)). In 2 meningiomas the images with In-111-Oc were very good (T/BT: 3.1, 3.6 (4hr pl)) and were negative with 1-123-MT. In 4 metastases we found a low uptake in 2 pts with 1-123-MT (T/BT (10'): 1.3 and 1.25; T/BT (lh): 1.25 and 1.2 and In-111-Oc (T/BT (4h pl): 1.6 and 1.4). These were pts with brain metastases of adeno carcinoma. In two pts with brain metastases of small cell lung cancer we found good images with both substances (I-123-MT T/BT: 1.6 and 1.7 (1 h) and In-111-Oc T/BT: 2.5 and 2.6 (4h pl). In summary, glioblastoma showed concordant images with both substances and also metastases, meningiomas showed discordant images. SPECT acquisition is possible with both substances and sometimes advisable. Twenty-three patients underwent PET examinations (Siemens ECAT 951R) prior to laparotomy. Dynamic FDG-PET scans of the pelvis were obtained for 60 minutes followed by PET imaging of the whole abdomen. Standardized uptake values for FDG were calculated based on attenuation corrected images and related to histological findings. Fourteen patients with primary and two patients with recurrent ovarian cancer had an increased, but heterogenous FDG uptake (SUV 5.4-+2.3). Necrotic/cystic areas could be clearly seperated from metabolicly active tumor sites. Five intraabdorninal abscess Iocalisations (n=3) also showed an intensive FDG accumulation (SUV 9.8+3.4). One patient with ovarial cystoma (SUV 1.1) and one case with ovarian borderline carcinoma (SUV 1.3) had low FDG uptake. In patients with benign cystic lesions (n=2) no significant FDG-uptake was seen. In areas with questionable CT-findings, FDG uptake aided in the accurate definition of metastatic tumor spread. In conclusion, differentiation between abscess and malignancy may be limited in patients with large pelvic masses. Correlation of FDG uptake with CT and sonography however adds diagnostic information. FDG-PET imaging is extremely useful in the Iocalisation of viable tumor tissue in new or recurrent ovarian cancer and may therefore guide surgical interventions. Several authors had reported on the value of IMLSc as a prognostic variable (PV) in BC. However, their conclusions might be criticized because they only take into account -as other potentiaJ PV -the axillary (ax) nodes status, Therefor, the follow-up (FUp) data of 860 patients ( mean FUp = 5 y. ) operated for histologically proven BC from t 2 / 1 9 7 8 to 12/~989 have been reviewed and analyzed ( Free Disease Interval curve, Delay Before Generalisation curve, Survival curve, Kaplan-Meier actuarial method, Logrank Test ) with regard to the various progonstic variables :clinical staging (CSt), ciinicat size (CSz), anstomopathological status of the ax nodes (AxAP), results of the IMLSc (IMLSc), hormonat ( estrogen ) receptivity (ER), hormonal treatment (HTt), menopausal status, age, differenciation of the tumor,.., in our population and whatever was the considered end-point ( FDI, DBG, S ), the main PV ( univadated analysis ) were the CSt or the CSz, the AxAP, the IMLSc ( 2p < 0.0001 when c~ass~fied as pathologic ), the HTt and the \u00a3R. When IMLSc was introduced in a Cox Modet ( Multivariated analysis ) with the other potential explicative PV, the scintigraphic result remains as one undependent explicative variable for the prognosis of BC. It is concluded that IMLSc represents one undependent PV in BC and that its result has to be taken into account in the management and treatment of BC. Breast cancer frequently occurs in women and patients (pts) prognosis has been shown to improve with early detection and aggressive treatment. Clinical examination, mammography (mmg) and fine needle biopsy are frequently inconclusive in order to characterise breast nodules. Aim of the present study has been the evaluation of the accuracy of Tc99m MIBI imaging to define malignant lesions and its possible role in the diagnostic strategy. Our study group consisted of 17 women affected by breast lesions detected by mmg who should be considered a random sample from the clinic.. All the pts were treated surgically and had a histological evaluation. 370-500 MBq of MIBI were injected in the antecubital vein opposite to the involved breast and the scan was performed immediately and after 2 hours. Pts were imaged by planar scintlgraphies obtained in anterior and anterior oblique views. Two independent experienced observers blinded to clinical and histological data interpreted the MIBI studies. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus. In 15 pts solitary nodules were found (tumor size = 2.4 +/-.9 cm); 2 pts suffered from diffuse pathology (carcinomathosis mastitis). In 13 pts a malignant disease (54% with positive mmg, 46% inconclusive) and in 4 benignant lesions (75% negative, 25% doubtful at mmg) were found. MIBI imaging showed 86% sensitivity and 75% specificity with an overall accuracy of 82%. Particularly MIBI imaging gave correct interpretation in 72% of pts with inconclusive mmg. Thus MIBI scan could be considered a useful tool, complementary to mmg, in the screening of breast nodules.

The MAb (M-CEATEC Fab, Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia, Italy) was labeled with 1480-1850 MBq (1 ml) of a fresh technetium generator eluate. After removing 12-20% remaining free pertechnetate by ion exchange chromatography, 740-1295 MBq (0.25-0.5 rag) were injected iv. Totally 50 patients were investigated. Planar scans were performed 1, 4 and 24 h pi, SPECT after 4 and 24 h. All scintigraphic results were correlated to morphologic imaging procedures (CT, MRI) and finally to histology after surgery or biopsy. The following lesions could be detected (scintigraphically pos. / all lesions): 4/4 colonic primaries, 15/15 locoregional recurrences, 24/31 liver metastases (scintigraphically hot or with warm rim), 11/11 lymph node metastases, 1/4 lung metastases, 2/3 brain metastases, 2/3 bone metastases and 4/5 peritoneal carcinoses. Positive tumor detection was possible in 16% as early as 1 h pi, in 82% 4 h pi. SPECT was superior to planar scans in 43%, especially with respect to locoregional recurrence and liver metastases. Previously unsuspected lesions were found in 42% of patients. Summarizing, the use of 99roTe-labeled F(ab')2 fragments could yield additional information to conventional imaging procedures (CT, MRI) in the staging of colorectal cancer patients. The sensitivity for ]ocoreg. recurrence and lymph node metastasis detection was especially high, despite the renal elimination of MAb fragments (SPECT indispensable). ",

The patients were imaged quantitively with garmaa camera, at least three times prior to surgery. scintlgraphic data were compared with tissue samples from surgery 48 h after injection.

T~ for radioactivity was 1.5-3.1 h in serum and 1.4-3.7 h in urine. About 50% of the activity was excreted in urine within 3 h. In all patients > 95% of the activity was excreted in 22 h.

The average response rate is lower than 20%. Since tumor response to FU chemotherapy necessitates the accumulation of the cytostatic agent in the metastases, PET with F-18 labeled FU can be used to assess the tracer concentration in the target area. We used a PET system to evaluate the FU uptake and trapping in patients with liver metastases prior to the FU chemotherapy. The target area corresponded to the largest tumor diameter and was determined by CT shortly before the PET study. F-18 labeled FU was administered together with S00 mg nonlabeled FU in order to obtain therapeutic concentrations. Sequential PET images were acquired for two hours beginning with the FU infusion. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated from the PET cross sections two hours after tracer application. All patients received several cycles of FU chemotherapy after the PET study. In 2 pts with pulmonary metastases, 1 pt with kidney involvement and pt with recurrence of CC RIS findings were negative. Whole-body scan imaged 63% of described lesions, and 20-24 hours SPECT showed more lesions than 4-6 hours one (ratio 1,2:1,0). No correlation was found between CEA serum levels and RIS results. In conclusion our results suggest that RIS is a useful procedure in the follow up of pts with CC, especially in situation when the results of other diagnostic modalities are equivocal. SPECT imaging at 20-24 hours seems to be mandatory. ",

In sharp c~ntrast, 23 dut of 26 patients with pathologic diagnosis of benign bone lesion had a negative MIBI-99Tc scan (p<0.O01). The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of MIBI scan for malignant bone tumor were 76%, 88% and 86%, respectively. Conclusions: MIBI-99Tc bone scan is a useful noninvasive test for the detection of the malignant nature of a tumor-like bone lesion. An imaging modality able to detect lymph node (micro)metastases of head and neck cancer could be important for staging purposes. In this study we investigated the applicability of L-l-[tlC]-tyrosine (TYR) for the detection of lymph node involvement in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Seven patients with histologically verified No-N2c squamous cell carcinoma were studied. Patients received 370 MBq TYR. A total length of 21.6 cm was studied via 2 static emission scans (Siemens ECAT 951/31). Of 6 patients preoperative T 1-and T2-weighted MRIimages were available. Shortly after PET neck dissection followed. Comparisons were made between PET, MRI, and histopathology. In the 7 resection specimens of the PET-studied patients a total of 130 lymph nodes were present. In 11 of these nodes metastatic disease was found. All histologically proven metastatic lymph nodes were visualized with PET. In addition, 10 other lymph nodes were visualized, being either normal or reactive on histopathology. The smallest lymph node detected was 0.5 om in diameter, In all patients the submandibular and parotid glands showed high uptake of TYR. Preliminary sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy can be calculated at 100%, 93%, and 94%, respectively. In comparison, in the resection specimens of the 6 MRI-studied patients 108 lymph nodes were present. Six nodes showed metastatic disease. On MRI, 4 nodes gave a true-positive and 4 nodes gave a false-positive signal. Consequently, the figures for MRI are 67%, 96%, and 94%, respectively. In conclusion: in the evaluation of lymph node involvement of squamous cell head and neck cancer TYR-PET can be a valid diagnostic tool. Our figures are favourable to those reported for FDG-PET. ",

However, it is an invasive procedure which can be performed only at few skeletal sites, with the risk of false negative findings. Radioimmunoscintigraphy (R/S) with Tc-99m labeled antigranulocyte MAb BW250/183 seems to be efficacy in detecting BM or bone localization in malignant lymphomas, but its specificity is still to be determined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of RIS with MAb BW250/183 labeled with Tc-99m (555-740 MBq), in malignant lymphomas, comparing the results with BM biopsy. RIS was judged positive in case of presence of cold areas. The results in 12 patients are summarised in Table l. In patients with documented BM invasion RIS was positive in 8/8 patients. In 3/4 cases with no documented BM invasion RIS was negative. In a patient heavily pretreated R.IS showed several cold areas although BM negativity. In untreated patients, RIS showed a very good correlation with clinical status. In pre-treated patients the usefulness orRIS is limited because it can be positive in case of both BM infiltration and post therapy fibrosis. Rat prostate adenocarcinoma cells were incubated for 10 or 60 minutes in media with different glucose content. Furthermore, the cells were treated for 4 hours with different doses of gemcitabine and the FDG uptake was measured immediately and 4 hours after the end of treatment. The FDG transport was determined with a zero-trans assay and the mRNA content of the glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) and the hexokinase (Hk). After 60 minutes incubation a decrease in FDG uptake was found with increasing cell number in all media. A shorter incubation time of 10 minutes yielded more stable uptake data. The glucose content decreased with increasing cell number and incubation time, indicating that the glucose-to-FDG ratio is not constant in assays using glucosecontaining media. According to these data, we suggest an uptake procedure in glucose-free medium with an end concentration of 0.1 mM FDG or a zero-trans assay to determine the maximum velocity (Vmax) and the affinity (Kin) of the transport system. Treatment with gemeitabine caused a rime and dose dependent increase in FDG uptake. Incubation experiments with 3H-inulin revealed that the changes were not caused by unspecific membrane alterations. The K m of the transport system remained unchanged, whereas Vmax in\" creased. However, the mRNA content for GLUT1 and Hk was unchanged. These data indicate that the number of glucose carriers at the plasma membrane increased after treatment with gemcitabine, probably due to redistribution phenomena from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. These effects may be part of cellular stress reactions after exposure to chemotherapy with gemeitabine. Drug resistance is a well-known disadvantage in chemotherapeutical cancer treatment. This has not been verified for the anthracycline derivate 4\"-deoxy-4\"-iododoxorubicin (IDOX). Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the uptake of radiolabelled IDOX in carcinoma cells with clearly defined drug response, i.e. anthracyline resistant (ARC) and sensitive (ASC). IDOX was radiolabe]led with I-123 in conventional manner by the Iodogen method yielding radiochemical purity of > 98 %. 10 kBq 1-123labelled IDOX and 20 kBq T1-201 were added to each culture medium (n=100), respectively. Cellular uptake was stopped by removing the medium at different incubation times and cooling. After washing, measuring cellular uptake in a well counter, and correcting for physical decay, uptake of I-123-IDOX was calculated in anthracycline resistant (D 257/85 DR) and sensitive (D 257/85 P) human gastric carcinoma cells. Results are given as percental uptake of the activity applied and as well as ratios to the uptake of T1 In conclusion, uptake of IDOX could be shown to be higher in sensitive than in resistant gastric carcinoma cells. The kinetics in ARC suggest a diminished uptake rather than an active transport out of the cells. Thus, IDOX behaves similarly to anthracylines known. Due to the increase of immunoscintigraphy (IS) in infections, turnours and their metastases, the problem of HAMA (human antimouse antibodies) has become more relevant, because HAMA may influence the diagnostic outcome of IS. So the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of HAMA in IS using different MAbs. In about 245 patients (mean age: 57 yrs; range: 20 -89) 265 HAMA serum courses were intensively documented up to eight weeks after injection of various and differently labeled monoclonal antibodies: In 197 patients (215 HAMA courses) IS of infections was performed, partially after repeated or simultaneous injections of antigranulocytes MAb [I-123-Mab47 (0.15 rag), Tc-99m-Mab47 (0,4 mg); Tc-99m-BW250/183 (0.4 rag)]. 21 patients (23 courses) with coloreetal cancer received anti-CEA MAb [Tc-99m-BW431/26 (1 mg)], and in 27 patients monoclonal anti-melanoma F(ab') 2 fragments [Tc-99m-TECNEMAB-K-1 (0.35 rag)] were administered. HAMA serum titers were determined by an ELISA-test system. Pathologieaily elevated HAMA serum levels were seen in 40/265 (15 %) courses of all patients examined [antigranuloeytes MAb: 17/165 (11%) after first, and 16/50 (32 %) after repeated injection; finti-CEA MAb: 4/21 (19 %) after first, 2/2 after repeated injection; after anti-melanoma F(ab')2: no pathological response] mostly two and four weeks after application and a normalization eight weeks thereafter in most of the cases. Seven patients of all (about 3 %) with strongly high HAMA tlters after repeated MAb injections showed an altered biodistribution of Mabs and reduced imaging quality, but no adverse reactions. The results show that in IS the potential human immunoreaction (about 11% after first injection) depends on the total MAb protein amount applied, especially after repeated injections. The maximum of the HAMA response, especially in IS of infections, appears two weeks ager injection with a mostly complete regression after 8 weeks. So in routine diagnostic work after first injection of/dAb, the problem of HAMA is negligible regarding potential disorders of the biodistribution of MAb or of the imaging quality of IS as well as adverse reactions.

However, due to the well-known cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines, there are only few data concerning the impact of verapamil on myocardial accumulation of radiolabelled DOX and IDOX to estimate the potential risk of increasing cardiotoxicity. DOX and IDOX were radioiodinated with 1-123 by the Iodogen method yielding radiochemical purity > 98%. 40 MBq of labelled DOX and IDOX were administered intravenously to four rabbits, respectively.

Both methods can only be employed to a certain extent and therefore are limited as a tool for rapid decision making concerning changes in therapy concepts and/or early evaluation of therapy success or failure. The aim of this study was to estimate the use of the proliferation marker tissue polypeptide antigen specific (TPS) to predict the actual status of known bone metastases as compared to the results of standard Tc-99m-MDP bone scintigraphy. In the learning phase of this study, serum levels of TPS we correlated with the results of bone scans of patients transfered to our department for routine bone scintigraphy. At the first analysis the results of patients with no documented primary tumor (N=10) were correlated with those suffering from cancer (N=70). In a second analysis, patients with a known malignancy were subgrouped depending on the results of the bone scan as follows: 1) no bone metastases detected (N=44); 2) known bone metastases (N=26) a) in remission (N=3), b) stable disease (N=14) and c) progressive disease (N=9) as compared to previous scans. Our preliminary data indicate significant lower TPS serum levels in patients without a known primary tumor as compared to patients suffering from a malignancy. No significant difference was found comparing TPS serum levels of the various subgroups due to high variance. Nevertheless, patients with proven bone metastases (n=9) showed a dependency of TPS levels and extent of disease. On the other hand, scintigraphically documented metastases were never associated with normal TPS levels. We conclude from these preliminary data that TPS is probably not able to replace bone scintigraphy per se, but might allow to follow and supplement bone scans in the individual course of cancer. Physico-chemical properties, e.g. lipophilicity may effect cellular uptake This could be shown successfully for 1-123 versus Tc-99m as radiolabel. Therefore, the aim of this studie is to compare the uptake of two analogous anthracylines being different in an additional iodine only, i.e. doxombicin (DOX) and iodo-doxombicin (IDOX). Both anthracyclines were radiolabelled with I-t23 in a conventional manner by the Iodogen method yielding radiochemical purity of more than 98 %. t0 kBq 1-123-DOX or 1-123-IDOX were added to each culture medium in addition to 20 kBq T1-201 (n=100), respectively. Cellular uptake was stopped by removing the medium at different incubation times and cooling.

In conclusion, both kinetics and amount of uptake of the more lipophilic I-123-IDOX and I-123-DOX are very similar. Thus, lipohilicity is not a determining factor for cellular uptake. Uptake measurements of radiolabelled anthracyclines may be affected by its different physico-chemical properties due to different radiolabels.

Twelve of these pts had also been submitted to CT and/or NM1L The immunoscintigraphy was performed with fragments of the MoAb 225.28S labeled with 99mTc, using 0.35 mg and 750+186 MBq/pt. All-body imaging (10 min./m), planar images of the head, in anterior view, and in 20 pts SPET study (40 seconds/view x 32 views, -90 \u00b0 to 90 \u00b0) were performed at 4.75_+0.75 hours. At 24 hours post injection, planar images of the head were also done. The first planar head images permitted a 10:17 (58.8%) true positive (TP) results and 5:6 (83%) of true negative (TN) studies. The same results were, respectively, 15:17 (88.2%) and 6:6(100%) for the 24-hour image, and 15:15 (100%) and 5:5 (100%) for the SPET study. Evaluated as a whole group, the~ immunoscintigraphy permitted 16:17 (94%) TP studies and 5:6 (83%) TN ones. The intensity of activity was qualitatively classified as small, moderate and intense, and we tried to correlate it with the biggest diameter of the lesion. It seemed that a biggest diameter permitted a higher focal activity, although the small number of studies in each group did not permit the use of statistical tests. Five lesions were not detected by CT and 3 by NMR, and all of these were visualized with the scintigraphic study. Two pts had liver metastasis, not seen with the 99mTc-MoAb. These results suggest that this method may still be used to study intra-ocular lesions suspected of being melanomic, especially if SPET acquisition is used. On the contrary, it is of no use to detect metastasis, since the main place of secondary lesions is the liver, an organ with a very high unspecific binding of the MoAb. The actual value ofI-123-MIBG SPET in neuroendocrine tumors, and in particular in neurohlastoma (/fiB), is controversial. Therefore a comparison between planar and SPET imaging in NB was undertaken. We report here the resahts obtained in 18 patients (9 M and 9 F, aged 4 m o . -l l yr; one at stage I~ six at stage ]]I, ten at stage IV, one at stage IVS). Imaging (a total of 28 studies) was performed at diagnosis (2), at~er surgery (5), during or after chemotherapy (13), at follow up (5) and at relapse (3). Both planar, at 24 and occasionally 40 Jars (multiple anterior and posterior images; 500,000-1,000,000 counts per scan) and SPET imaging at 24 hrs (64 projections obtained over 360 at 30 sec/projection) were carried out aider i.v. injection of 148-296 MBq of I-123-MIBG. Planar studies gave a sensitivity of 89.5 % and a specificity of 88.9 %. In the same patients SPET gave a sensitivity of 94.7 % and an equal (88.9 %) specificity. When compared with planar scanning, SPET imaging showed a total of six additional pathological areas of uptake in three patients. In another patient an equivocal abnormality on planar imaging was confirmed as pathological by SPET. Furthermore, SPET improved the anatomical assessment of the lesions in 12/18 studies. In conclusion: the association of SPET can improve the diagnostic efficacy of MIBG scintigraphy in the evaluation of NB. In our experience SPET was conclusive in detecting lesions in one case, essential in another three cases and helpful, by giving additional information~ in 12/18 true positive studies.",

SPET of chest or abdomen was performed at 5-8 horns after injection in all patients. No adverse reactions were observed in any patient after MAb infusion and no appreciable change were seen in the blood counts, renal and liver function tests. A total of 17 from 18 (94.4%) lymphoma lesions were detected by RAID All the tumor locaiizations were confirmed with clinical examination and with other imaging techniques, such as CT scan or MR] or gallium scan In this series of patients no false positive results were noted and only I false negative result in a patient who had a mediastinal bulky disease. As regard the biodistribution of the immunoreagent we can do the following considerations :-) no appreciable marrow activity was seen in all patients -) spleenic targeting was demonstrated in all patients -) tumor to non tumor ratio ranged from 12 to 2.8 -) no difference of uptake was noted in different tumor grade The images performed 24 hours after injection did not detect new lesions, but areas of doubful uptake were seen as positive focal areas in the delayed scan In these preliminary results the LL2-Fab MAb seems to be useful for detection staging and follow up oFNHL patients. The application of Tc-99m-MIBI instead of TI-201 seems to be desirable because of a lower radiation exposure, a more favourable distribution and better image quality. Therefore we examined 17/117 patients with OTC suspecting recurrent disease after thyroidectomy. Planar imaging of the whole bochr was performed 15-20 min. after admainistration of 74 MBq TI-201 and 555 MBq Tc-9Sm-MIBI. In addition all patients had a SPECT study of the neck and chest after planar imaging. 10/13 local recurreneies (LR) were detected planar with b e t h radiopharmaeeuticals (R). In one ease the tremor was Te-99m-MIBl-pesitive and TI-201negativ. 2 LR could not be demonstrated neither b y TI-201 nor by Tc-99m-MIBI scintigraphy. In case of distant metastases planar scintigraphy with both R led to the tumor site (n = 9). Moreover 6 recurrent free patients as well as two patients with abnormal Tg-ser~-levels had a normal scintigraphy. That means: Tc-99m-MIBI true positive (TP) 20, false negative (FN) 4, true negative (TN) 6 and false positive (FP) 0; Ti-201 TP 19, FN 5, TN 6 and FP O. SPECT was proved to be important for localisation of recurrent disease. Tumors in addition were not deteetable. Quantification of the tumor uptake of TI-201 and Tc-99m-MIBI using the l{OI-methed led to a higher tumorhaekground-ratio for Tc-99m-MIBI. The difference was proved %0 be highly significant (p _< 0.0005). TC-99m-MIBI planar imaging as well as SPECT showed a higher imaging quality compared to TI-201, especially in deeply situated tremor lesions. In conclusion, Tc-99m-MIBI seems to be a promising alternative imaging agent in the follow-up of oxyphilio thyroid carcinomas. DOSE  RATE  MEASUREMENT  AND  TARGETED  RADIOTHERAPY WITH 186RHEN1UM_HEDP FOR THE  TREATMENT OF PAINFUL BONE METASTASES. We have treated 21 patients with disseminated painful bone metastases with 186Re-HEDP. Patients received 40 mCi of 186Re-HEDP with iterative readministration 3 to 4 months later in cases of a favourable antalgic response and after hematopoietic toxicity has subsided. Rhenium-186 emits both beta and gamma rays. The beta emission provides the local irradiation of metastatic lesions while the gamma emission enables visualization of the tracer's biodistribution and dosimetric calculation. In all cases, conjugated view sequential whole body scintigraphy allows to calculate a cumulated activity curve. Knowledge of the physical characteristics of Rhenium-186 and of the accurate volume of a painful metastasic site (by tomodensitometry) associated with the activity curve allow dosimetric calculations to establish the dose rate and the total dose to the reference metastasis. To appreciate the efficacy and toxicity of targeted radiotherapy, we also measure pain score, analgesic index and various biological parameters. Analysis of these parameters suggest a correlation between the calculated dose rate and clinical and biological responses. We observe no favourable clinical response with dose rate under 0.2 Gy/hour whereas dose rate over 0.5 Gy/hour are often associated with complete antalgic responses. This efficient dose rate, if not reached by the first administration, could be approached by the iterative administration of the radiopharmaceutical. An effective treatment increases the osteoblastic activity in the metastatic lesions which could increase the later uptake of the radiopharmaceutical, the dose rate and therefore progressively ameliorate the antalgic efficacy of the treatment. In a prospective study, we evaluated the efficacy of Re-186 HEDP for the reduction of pain and consequently, the need for analgesics in patients with skeletal metastases. 20 single injections of 1295 MBq were given to 18 patients (prostate cancer n = 10, breast cancer n =5, lung cancer n=l, bladder cancer n=l, colorectal cancer=l) who received analgesics for the treatment of pain caused by multiple bone metastases (solitary metast, n=2). Tc-99m MDP bone scans (obtained before therapy) and Re-186 HEDP scans were used for quantitative analysis.",

During the three year observation period, 649 patients were treated with a total dose of 1147 GBq (31 Ci) 1-131. A value of > 0.5 Bq/cm 2 was classified as \"contamination\". Overall, 108 contaminations were detected, 94 (87%) of them in the patients' rooms and t4 (13%) in the remaining rooms, all of the latter sharing values below 5 Bq/cm 2.

We are trying to overcome this disadvantage of In-ll4m radiopharmaceutical. Lung cancer volume shrinked in patients of both groups. The patients are followed up with bone and Ga-67 total-body sointigraphy. We have also observed complete remission of advanced lung cancer with cationic Pt(II) complex in patients kept on special diet; Radionuclide cancer therapy has so far been limited to bone metastasis pain palliation with Sm-153-EDTMP, Re-186-HEDP, Sr-89-C12, NaOrthophosphate-32 or Y-90 citrate solutions. Present paper reports the cure of 19 patients with tumour-affine Y-90 solution. The biochemical properties of prostate cancer and its metastases investigated with pure radionuclide (To-99m, Ca-67, Sm-153, and Y-90) distribution in prostate cancer patients showed that prostate cancer is cation-affine while its bone metastases have high affinity for radionuclide anionic species. Studies of the complexes formed by Y-90 with citrate, EDTA, or DTPA as ligands showed citrate medium to be most suitable to obtain both cationic and anionic complexes of Y-90 for advanced prostate cancer therapy. Ninteen patients with widely diffused bone metastasis, with PSA value above 250 ng/ml and in whom surgery, radiotherapy and hormone therapy had failed to arrest the growth of the disease were admitted to this Y-90 therapy. Depending on the seriousness of the disease, first dose given i.v. to the patient has been iii MBq. Subsequent doses were 74 MBq each week until the bone pain disappeared, PSA value returned to normal, and bone scintigrame shewed no metastases. PSA value, bone seintigraphy, and blood analyses of the patients were examined first at 3 months interval and then half-yearly. No adverse effect of the therapy was so far observed. Patients resumed their normal activity. Follow-up time so far has been 2 years. In the course of radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroidism, 1-131, a beta emitter with a mean range in soft tissue of 0.5 mm, possibly may damage C-cells by irradiation which originates from neighboring follicular cells. Up to now, only few retrospective studies have focused on this question. We therefore started a prospective study in 15 patients with Graves\" disease and 15 patients with functional autonomy. Plasma samples for the determination of calcitonin were drawn immediately before and 6 weeks after 1-131 treatment. Since plasma calcitonin is undetectable in more than 50% of healthy persons, a solid phase silica gel extraction method was used to enrich monomeric calcitonin (mCT) in plasma. Afterwards mCT was measured by an immunoradiometric assay (CT-IRMA Medgenix).",

However, in patients with functional autonomy, initial mCT levels were lower (3.8 pg/ml) as compared to Graves\" patients; no significant decrease could be observed after 1-131 treatment (3.4 pg/ml). The decrease of plasma taCT in Graves\" patients after 1-131 may be interpreted as radiation induced impairment of thyroidal C-cells. On the other hand, since this effect is not seen in patients with functional autonomy, initially higher levels of plasma mCT in Graves\" disease may be disease specific in the meaning of a more relevant impairment of bone metabolism.

From the time of detection, we calculated survival curves dividing patients by age, sex, histology and 131I uptake~ then we compared obtained results at 5, 10, 15 yrs intervals. Survival curve by age, under or over 45, shows a statistically significant longer extention of life for pts under 45 (Student two tailed t-test:p<O.~l at 5 and 10 yrs; I><O.01 at 15 yrs). We did not obtained same results by sex and histology. In the survival curve according to 1311 uptake, we observed a good significance at 15 yrs (p<O.O1), that mostly reduces at following intervals for disappearence of pts with non uptaking lesions.The survival condictio ning factors in pts with DTC LM are primarely the age at time of methastases detection and the ability to concentrate 131I. As confirmation we observed age under 45 in all the 29 pts (32.2% of all samples) in complete absence of disease at present time (5 yrs minumum from last 131I therapeutic administrationmean dose 405.2\u00b1218.5~Ci). In conclusion is confirmed the importance of more frequent controls in older pts, also using all other methods, for a precocious diagnosis of methastases and better results of radioiodine therapy. ",

Digital acquisition demands large image matrixes up to 1024 x 384 pixels, therefore high resolution imagers are recommended, which are very expensive. Furthermore the integration of a documentation system as a network component is essential concerning the development of PACS, which offers image interpretation on digital workstations and the availability of patient and image databases. After evaluation of the documentation systems commercially available, a colour laser copier was chosen and adapted to the required profile. The system offers: grey scale and colour image documentation suitable for different medical imaging modalities with one system only, -image resolution comparable to analogues acquired scintigrams, grey scale linearity up to 256 shades with an optical density range (0.1 -2.0 OD) and an automatic adaptation on different colour scales, screen display appropriate to the printed image (WYSIWYG) via exact colour conversion by a 3D-colour space (CIE-XYZ) and Postscript-Standard, network integration by Standard-Ethemet and software tools independent on hardware configurations, reduction of operating costs and working time of staff for image generation, use of environmentally friendly materials, abandonment of Developer/ Fixer solutions, X-ray films, colour foils and coated papers, post processing of analogues acquired scintigrams and printing of unlimited copies. The presented system has proven its usefulness in clinical routine. True colour printing combined with a high image resolution and the possibility of high sophisticated grey scale printing can be achieved very costeffectively. Displaying up to 256 grayshades for planar and tomograpbic images offers excellent conditions for image interpretation and might represent an adequate substitute or at least a complementary copy for the conventional X-ray film (NM, MRT, CT, US).

In PET this calibration might be erroneous and in SPECT it might be doubtful due to fundamental problems of the tracer quantitation in tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the dependency of rate constants resulting from a non-linear regression analysis on calibration errors. Using a true arterial plasma curve of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) an FDG-tissue curve was simulated assuming standard rate constants K l, k 2, k 3, and k 4 and a vascular tracer Signal based on a cerebral blood volume of 4%. Calibration errors were simulated by multiplying the resulting tissue curve with an error factor (EF) ranging from 0.5 over 1 (i.e. accurate calibration) to 1.5. In addition, these curves were distorted with different levels of gaussian noise. For each EF and noise level the curves were generated 10 times. All resulting curves were analysed with a standard non-linear regression fitting procedure based on the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. When a noiseless curve was examined, K 1 and CBV were regained correctly only for EF=I and were furthermore positively correlated with EF (r2=l). For k:~, k 3, and k 4, however, the accurate values were obtained independent of EF. When noisy curves were fitted all parameters were different from their true values, K 1 and CBV were still correlated to EF (r2=0.99 and 0.98, respectively), but k 2, k3, and k\u00a2 were not. The relative errors of the latter parameters were 10_+10%, 13_+24%, and 180_+95% over the range of EF from 0.5 to 1.5 when the noise level was raised to 6% of noiseless data. Our results demonstrate that the determination of K 1 in a threecompartment model depends on the accuracy of the calibration between tissue and plasma activity. The accuracy of determining kz, k 3, and k 4 is in principle independent from calibration errors, but depends significantly on image noise characteristics.",

            "text": "AUTOMATIC SCALING OF BONE IMAGES FOR DIGITAL DISPLAYS Modem gamma camera systems with digital displays usually scale an image to the maximum pixel value. On bone scans, this can lead to inappropriate scaling if hot areas (e,g. bladder) are present and staff must manually adjust the display maximum. We have examined the distribution of pixel count values in 30 normal bone studies with no hot areas. Histograms of the number of pixels against pixel count were created. Pixel count values of zero were omitted. The pixel count value at which 75% of the pixels had that value or below was determined (effectively, the \"median\" of the distribution but with 75% instead of 50%). This was used since the median count was thought too low for accuracy. For each view type the 75% count value was remarkably consistent (e.g. for anterior abdomen 23/30 had the value of 12, 5/30 had the value 11 and 2/30 had the value 13). Also,sampling only 1 in 4 pixels of a 2562 image gave the same 75% value, and significantly speeded up the calculation. The ratios of the maximum count to the 75% count for the 30 normals were: ant. abdomen 4.3; post. abdomen 3.9; post. pelvis 4.7; ant. shoulder 4.4; and post. skull 4.0. The scale maximum of an image is set by determining the 75% count value and multiplying by the appropriate ratio. This procedure takes only a few seconds to run and allows a fully automatic protocol for the output of a standard bone study.

In order to optimize these procedures, for example to determine the minimum amount of activity to be injected and the optimal counting time or to evaluate the precision of the end result, analysis of the propagation of errors is needed. We evaluated two methods of error analysis: 1. the classical one in which propagation of errors was calculated according to standard formula's, which has disadvantages of being complex in case of complex calculations and when curve analysis has to be done. Furthermore this method requires that the interim results which are used in the calculation of the end result are independent of each other which is often not the case. 2. Error analysis based on the simulation of spreading of the measurements according to a normal distribution (which is also an assumption with the classical method), which can be accomplished with aid of a simple spreadheat program, even in complex investigations. We used both methods for optimizing renal clearance studies with Hippuran and thalamate to measure effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Method 2 turned out to be very reliable, was much less subject to errors, was easier and more flexible than method 1. For the ERPF and GFR determinations, the error analysis resulted in an improvement of the precision of the ERPF from 4 to 2,4% and a reduction in the thalamate amount which had to be administered of 50% without significant loss of precision. We conclude that analysis of propagation of errors can be very usefull and is relatively easy with help of the error simulation method. Interaction of gamma radiation in tissue due to scatter may be shown by a comptonpeak image. The quality of this scatter image may be disturbed by septal penetration when using high energy photons. The purpose of this study is to minimize these artefacts by subtracting an appropriate fraction of the photonpeak image from the comptonpeak image.",

Rather often, the prediction is based on estimates of effective half-life T<r, i.e. the time during which activity within the region of interest falls to 1/2 of its original value. As a rule, estimates are based on least squares fit of the strMghtline in semi-logarithmic coordinates. Such a solution is susceptible to measurement errors, provides little information on the estimate rellabilit~\u00a2 and neglects accessible prior information. These drawbacks are even enhanced when the point estimate is used for prediction of the future activity values. Bayesian solution presented in the contribution removes the mentioned drawbacks by respecting the well defined probabilistic problem structure and by exploiting all informational sources available. Specifically, Poisson distribution of the recorded counts and well defined range of possible half-lives 0 < T~ 1 < T~ = physical half-life of the radionuclide are built-in the procedure. The proposed algorithm produces not only a half-life point estimate but complete description of its uncertainty even for a small number of measurements which are at disposal. The same outcomes can be gained for the predicted activities as they are simple deterministic functions of T,]. The claimed favourabIe properties of the procedure are demonstrated on a wide range of real-life data related to diagnostics/therapy of thyroid diseases by ~slI and compared to the standard least squares fit.",

Usually, arterial data are obtained from the brachial artery using an automated blood sampling device. However, an arterial puncture bears the disadvantage of being invasive and thereby potentially dangerous to the subject. Therefore, we attempted to estimate the arterial input curve from the intracranial carotid artery that is regularly present in the lower two slices of our rCBF PET images. In six rCBF studies on healthy volunteers, the arterial time activity curves recorded with a sampling rate of 1 s were corrected for decay, delay, and dispersion. Their maximums were reached after approximately 12 s. The supraclinoidal part of the carotid arteries was identified on count rate images integrated over 40 s. Mean values of 5 pixels bilaterally drawn in the centers of the carotid artery were analyzed dynamically with a sampling rate of 2 s. The mean time activity curve calculated for the carotid arteries were corrected for decay. These curves were, however, heavily attenuated by the partial volume effect of the reconstructed PET images (full width half maximum, FWHM = 9 ram). Using the diameter of the supraclinoidal carotid artery as given by Talairach and Toumoux (1988, Co-planar stereotaxic atlas of the human brain, Thieme) the recovery coefficient was calculated according to Mazziotta et al. (J Comput Assist Tomogr 5: 734-743, 1981) . Our results show that the decay and partial volume effect corrected blood curves of the intracranial carotid arteries closely overlapped with the decay, delay, and dispersion corrected blood curves of the punctured brachial artery. In conclusion, we were able to calculate a reliable arterial input curve for quantitative rCBF images from PET image data. This approach is completely non-invasive, since it has the potential of allowing the calculation of functional rCBF images without need of arterial puncture.",

            "text": "The two-dimensional (2D) prefiltering of scintigraphic projection images yielded a considerable improvement of the signal/noise ratio (S/N) of reconstructed SPECT images (M. King et al., 1984) . Our work investigated whether a similar approach can be apj~lied to PETring systems, where the projection data are not primanl-y two~dimensional, but recorded as one-dimensional projection profiles. The one-dimensional projection profiles acquired from neighbouring angles inside the PET detector-ring are highly correlated in respect to their signals, but less to noise. If the neighbouring profiles are assembled in a 2D matrix, i.e. as a 2D sinogram, a 2D filter can be applied. For the 2D prefiltering a 3 by 3 kernel with symmetric weights of 1, 2 and x was chosen, where the central weight x was varied from 4 to 16 and applied to the data of neighbouring projection angles, i.e. to the 2D sinogram data, The following 1D filter step of the filtered back projection used only a minimum low pass filtering (i.e. with cut-off frequency = Nyquist frequency). For comparison, the conventional 1D low pass filtering without any 2D prefiltering was done with different lower cut-off frequencies. The approach was tested with simulated noise-containing projection data of a line source whose amplitude after filtering (before reconstruction) was examined. Furthermore, a phantom was scanned, in which both a line source and a homogeneous distribution of F-18 was installed. The maximum pixel value of the line source in the reconstructed image was regarded as a measure for S and the variation inside the homogeneous image area as a measure for N. The amplitude of the line source in the simulated projection data was 29% higher for 2D prefiltering with a central weight of 12 than for the 1D approach, although noise was decreased. The phantom study showedalso an advantage of the 2D prefiltering. For x equal 4 the 2D prefiltering yielded an S 10% higher than that with the conventional filtered backprojection -without any enhancement of N. In conclusion, also for PET ring-cameras the simple method of a 2D prefiltering of the projection data leads to an improvement of S/N of reconstructed images. The 2D filter kernel must be designed in respect to the statistical characteristics of the projection data. ",

            "text": "OF NEUROACTIVATION BRAIN SPECT STUDIES SPECT neuroactivation studies imply the acquisition of two sets of images, basal and activation studies, which have to be registered before quantitative comparison. In this work we analyze the full 3D-realignment including translational as well as transverse, coronal and sagittal rotational corrections. Two methods of alignment were studied. The first one is based on Principal Axes Transformation (PAT). The second one uses the results of the first method as initial values to start a leastsquares iterative process (LS) based on a downhill simplex algorithm to search for the maximum value of the correlation function in brain. The unwanted activity corresponding to salivary glands, mouth and activity below the cerebellum, was eliminated by using a mask built as an intersection of three masks drawn in the x, y, z, directions. Both methods were tested with simulated and real studies. The results of the PAT method showed a maximum translation error of 0.3\u00b10.1 pixels and a rotational error of 1.2\u00b10.7 degrees in a total of 100 runs. For LS method these errors were 0.2\u00b10.1 and 0.6\u00b10.3. The realignment for ii real studies was assessed by three expert observers. The alignment was found satisfactory in all cases for LS method, and in 6 cases for PAT method. We conclude that the combination of the PAT and LS methods is a valid solution for the realignment of SPECT neuroactivation studies. Advances in High Density Avalanche Chamber (HIDAC) technology, incorporating a new design of photon converter, have resulted in reliable detectors with improved sensitivity and high spatial resolution. The intrinsic spatial resolution of the detectors has been measured as 1.5mm corresponding to a resolution of 2.7mm in the reconstructed image in both transverse and axial planes. A prototype clinical PET scanner incorporating such detectors has been used successfully for high resolution volume imaging of head and neck lymphomas in patients using 18-FDG and 64-Cu-PTSM, and for turnours xenografted onto mice using 18-FDG. A total of 24 mice tttmours were regionally damaged to varying extents with photodynamic therapy (PDT). The distribution of FDG uptake in PET images at 24 hours following PDT was identical to the distribution of viable tumour cells identified by histology, even where only a layer of 10-20 viable cells remained. It is concluded that the high resolution capability of this type of PET system has potential for clinical and research applications where high contrast uptake in small volumes is expected, such as in oncology. Algebraic reconstruction techniques (ART) have been intensively studied in image reconstruction. Despite ART enjoys a rapid convergence, the reconstructed images often exhibit a characteristic salt-and-pepper noise when applied to emission tomography. In this work we study the influence of a relaxation parameter(s) that yields smoother images while maintaining a good convergence. Each pixel value was updated accordin@ to the expression: ~k=~k-l+~ [ (~_~xik-lwki) /~w~w~. The study included simulated and real SPECT data by using a Jaszczak phantom. In simulated studies scattering,attenuation,noise and PSF of a general purpose collimator were included. Relaxation factors ranging between 0.02 and 0.4 were considered. Total counts in projections were 4x105. The goodness of the reconstructions was assessed by using the correlation coefficient between the pattern and the actual reconstruction (CC),the background coefficient of variation (CV) and the contrast (CON=(S-B)/(S+B)) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=(S-B)/aB) of each circle. The results over i0 runs for each relaxation factor showed the existence of a value near to 0.i which yields images with good values of the parameters (CC:0.96, CV:I7%, and CON:0.86 SNR:4.9 for the circle of 5 cm of diameter). The results from the real phantom, (CC:0.93,CV:20%,CON:0.87, SNR:3.9) in agreement with those of the simulated studies,reinforce the applicability of an optimum relaxation factor in SPECT reconstruction. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of reconstruction methodology in 1231-IBZM SPET on: (i) the statistical quality of the tomograms (total counts), (ii) the relative size of the striatal uptake (pixels in 80% isocontour ROD and (iii) the semiquantifieation of uptake (striatum to frontal cortex (ST/FC) ratios). Results of iterative reconstruction (ISA) with different numbers of iteration steps and exponents and filtered back projection using low-pass or Metz prefilters with different order numbers (i.e. different suppression of higher spatial frequencies) were compared in ten ~23I-IBZM SPET studies. In iterative reconstruction with the exponents one and two within the first 8 iteration steps, a variation of the reconstructed counts in tomograms on the level of the striatum between 130 000 and 1 900 000 (mean values of ten studies) was observed. Eight iterations with the exponent 4 resulted in a loss of image information (0 counts in \"reconstructed\" tomogram) in 8 of the i0 studies. Filtered back projection led to a smaller variation of reconstructed counts (710 000 to 840 000 with the Metz and 630 000 to 780 000 with the low-pass filter). Regarding the relative size of the striatum a reduction of size occurred with more iteration steps and higher exponents. Analogously a smaller representation of the striatal uptake was observed with higher filter order numbers (i.e. lesser suppression of higher spatial frequencies). Using iterative reconstruetinn with an exponent one, the mean ST/FC ratios were increased significantly (p<0.0005) from 1.17 to 1.64 within the first 8 iteration steps. With the exponent two a ratio of 1.64 was reached already after 3 iteration steps. With an exponent of four after 3 iterations a mean ST/FC ratio of 1.70 was obtained and in individual cases mtins higher than 2.00 were observed. Applying filtered back projection led to lower mean ratios (highest mean 1.66 with the Metz and 1.53 with the low-pass filter, in no case reties of 2.00 or higher were observed). It is concluded that reconstruction methodology has a fundamental influence on image statistics, representation of the size of the striatum and semiquantificatiun in 'z~I-IBZM SPET. Although iterative reconstruction with inadequate parameters may produces unreliable results, possibly a higher recovery can be achieved with iterative methods in comparison to filtered back projection. Moreover, objects smaller than 20 mm in diameter were not detectable in 131I studies and were visualized in 99mTc acquisitions only with the higher concentration ratio. As regards filters, Hamming and Butterworth with a medium cut-off frequency (0.25 cycles/pixel) and high order values allowed to obtain high contrast images with a minimal noise increase in all studies.",

Due to wall motion, ungated myocardial SPECT imaging may underestimate extent of myocardial infarctions. Aim of this study was to compare end-diastolic gated and ungated myocardial SPECT images concemig infarct detection, extension and severity. In 61 patients with coronary heart disease, gated SPECT (8 frames per cardiac cycle) was performed after injection of 740 MBq 99m-Tc methoxy-isobutyl-isonitdle (MIBI) using a triple head SPECT camera (Picker Prism 3000). Ungated SPECT images were generated by adding the 8 acquired frames. Using low-pass prefiltering and reconstruction by filtered back-projection, gated and ungated cardiac short and long axis tomograms were produced. A standardised 14-segment scheme was used for grading of segmental myocardial MIBI-uptake (normal, mild reduction, severe reduction, absent uptake). 739/854 segments were graded identical from gated and ungated tomograms (615 normal, 25 mild reduction, 34 severe reduction, 65 absent uptake). Of the 115 segments graded discordantly, MIBIuptake was inferior in the gated tomograms in 102 segments, in the ungated images in 13 segments. Differences between gated and ungated images reached statistical significance (McNemar-test, p<0.05) in apical, midventdcular and basal segments of the inferior wall, apical and midventricular segments of the anterior wall and the midventricular segment of the infereseptal wall. Out of the 102 segments graded infedor in the gated study, 31 corresponded to new infarct locations, 38 to extension of an infarct in a neighbouring segment and 33 to more marked infarctions in the gated study.",

Basic studies of 169yb uptake in normal (V 79/4) and KTCTL-2 cells(Heidelberg) were started with the aim of understanding and increasing accumulation of radiometals in tumours.Cellular uptake of 169yb given as citrate or NTA complex is linearly dependent on tracer concentration and incubation time, but is independent of the cell density per petri dish. 169yb uptake is dependent on the metabolic activity of the cell line (checked by [18F]FDG) as well as on the ligand species: the stronger-metabolizing V79 cells take up more 169yb from the citrate complex than the weaker-metabolizing tumour cells, whereas from the NTA,EDTA, and DTPA complexes the uptake is higher by the tumour cells, which does not correlate with the metabolic activities. By both cell lines by one order more 169yb is taken up from the citrate complex than from the aminocarbonic acid complexes. The results suggest the existence of different transport or uptake mechanisms i.)by the fibroblasts (V79/4) and the tumour cells, and ii.) from the citrate complex on the one hand and the NTA,EDTA,and DTPA complexes on the other.

For a clinical study, we performed dual isotope gastric emptying studies, using a post-production neutron activated 170Er enriched erbium-oxide enteric coated pancreatic enzyme preparation. The erbium was available as Er203. Four hours and eight hours after the ingestion of 4 MBq 171Er we obtained whole body scans using a dual headed camera at a scanspeed of 10 era/rain and a high energy collimator. Because of the pH-sensitive enteric coat of the pancreatic enzyme preparation that regulates the release of the pancreatic enzymes and 170Er enriched erbium-oxide, uptake of 171 Er from the gastrointestinal tract was only possible after the gastrointestinal pH exceeded 5.5 which is likely to happen in the small intestine. The preparation also contained significant amounts of 24Na, up to 400 kBq, resulting in increased background levels due to collimator septum penetration and down-scatter effects. Preliminary data from whole body scans in five volunteers indicate that the fractional uptake from the gastrointestinal tract did not exceed 0.0003, which matches the assumptions made in ICRP-30. Except from the gastrointestinal tract no specific uptake was seen in any organ system, especially not in the skeleton, liver or kidneys, as was previously reported by other investigators in animals. However, this may partially be due to the high level of 24Na downscatter. Our preliminary results confirm the assumptions used in the ICRP-30 tables.

Our modified method solves these problems by following way: The basic five minutes dynamic portal scintigraphy after 800 MBq 99m T c pertechnetate per rectum continues up to ten minutes when 80 MBq of 99~Tc sulphur colloid is administered i. v. on the start of 6th minute. The radioactive bolus in the heart and radiocolloid accumulated in the liver enable to delineate both the heart and liver ROIs by sufficient accuracy. The final static liver/kidney scintigraphy offers to obtain additional valuable informations. The border of rectal (bowel) activity is marked as the first ROI followed by ROIs of heart and liver. The case of interference the bowel and liver ROIs is solved using our own computer programme. The method has been tested on more than 100patients. The normal PSI was up to 7. The span of PSI in patients with liver diseases was from 9 up to 91. Hospitals usually need to document the excreted activity from patients to the sewerage system. Within the United Kingdom, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution have issued guidelines which are deliberately pessimistic eg. for all long-lived radionuclides the excreted activity is assumed to be 100% of the administered activity, except 131I outpatient therapy and 32P therapy, where the figure is 30%. All 99mTc radionuclides are assumed to be 30% However, in order to assess the mdiological impact of patient excretions, it is important that a more appropriate model of the situation should be used. Most excretions can be expressed as a sum of exponential components. We have derived a model for excretion for a single exponential component. In ICRP53, the whole body loss is generally expressed as a sum of exponential components with appropriate coefficients. These values have been used in conjunction with our model to derive the total excreted activity for a range of radiopharmaceuticals. For long half-life radionuclides, we have shown that the excretion for an exponential component with activity A at time t = 0 is A.T\u00bdB/T\u00bd E where T\u00bd B is the biological loss half-life, T\u00bd E is the effective loss half-life. For 99mTc, the aspect of discontinuous bladder excretion can be taken into account and ICRP 53 assume a 3\u00bd hour voiding time. Since only 6% of 99mTe remains after 24 hours of physical decay, excretions were derived for 7 urinary voids. These models will be derived and explained.",

In a follow-up experiment, the monkey was given 2 doses of 2 mg./kg p.o. of the selective irreversible MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline 19.5 hours and 7 hours before injection of [11C]-brofaromine. No decrease in radioactivity uptake in the monkey brain was observed. These results indicate either a high degree of non-specific binding or a slow pharmacokinetic of MAO-A inhibition by nC-brofaromine as known from the literature. The available time frame of PET measurements with tiC is probably too short to clarify this question. In conclusion, we therefore propose the use of [76Br] (half-life=16h) as a suitable PET radionuclide. Organic compounds labelled with 14C are used in different \"breath tests\". The expired metabolic end-product Z4C02 is usually measured by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). Due to the long T~ (5730 years) very few of the 14Catoms present distintegrate during measurement.",

The reactivity of [C-11]methyl triflate is very high. [C-11]~-CIT, EC-11]I3-CFT and EC-11]a-CIT were all prepared in 60-90% decay corrected yield from [C-11] methyl triflate by reaction with 0.15 mg norcompound for 1 min at 60\u00b0C, while the yields using [C-11]methyl iodide and similar amounts of precursor with heating at 80\u00b0C for 3-5 min were 3-4 times lower. The products were all purified using straight-phase HPLC. The total radiochemical yields of the final sterile and pyrogen-free products were 40-60% (from [C-11]CO2, decay corrected) within 30-35 min from EOB. The low amount of precursors needed when preparing these dopamine reuptake ligands from [C-11] methyl triflate is important when considering the commercial availability and cost of the precursors mad also for the final HPLC-purification.

In conclusion two metabolites were observed with an HPLC method after injection of [I-123] 13-CIT in humans. In recent years, other complexing agents such as tropolonate has been used for In-lll. Among the PET isotopes, Ga-68 has been used to label platelets. The short half-life ofGa-68 (68.1min) poses a severe limitation in situations where a longer waiting period is required for the tracer to accumulate in the organs of interest before imaging. We have already established procedures for a regular production of a number of medium half-life positron emitting radionuclides in our laboratory. Among these Co-55 (T\u00bd = 18hrs), Cu-64 (T\u00bd = 12hrs) and Ga-66 (T\u00bd = 9.4hrs) have chemical properties similar to those of In and therefore their complexes with oxine would make good potential candidates for labelling ceils with these PET isotopes. With these objectives in mind, we have investigated the conjugation of Co, Cu and Ga to oxine at microscale and tracer level using atomic absorption flame spectrometry and radioactive tracers. Complexes of Ga with oxine precipitate quantitatively at a pH 2, complexes of Co-oxine at a pH of 4.5 and Cu-oxine at a pH of 2.7. In preliminary experiments, Ga-67-oxine labelled red blood cells with a 84% labelling efficiency.

We report first results of PETrace MicroLab and quality of FDG. The MicroLab module produces automaticay 2-[18F] Fluoro -2-Desoxy glucose using 18-F Fluorid and Tetraacetyl-2-0-Tdfly-D-Manose. According to the regulations of Mulholland ~ phase transfer catalytic method was used.The catalyst is bound covalent on a polymer which serves for trapping 18-F Fluodd. 18-F-Fluodd is given automatically or by hand to a single use cartridge where the different steps for synthesis are running. Nearly the whole amount of 18-F/18-O endched H20 is saved on a reservoir and can be used again for FDG production. Quality control was done by ionexchangechromatography on a strong alkalinecolumne (CarboPacl, Dionex) with NaOH with gradienttechnic (start 15mM, end 55mM NaOH, runtime 50min, tret(FDG)=35min ). A amperometric technic was used for the detection of FDG. Within 6 month over 50 FDG production runs with MicroLab were performed.l.5 to 12 GBq 18-F-Fluorid were used starting the production whereas production time lasted 52 min. An overall average amount (not decay corrected) of over 32% FDG was reached. The TLC tested radiochemical purity was > 95% in 49/51 production runs. In one production no injectable FDG could be produced, because the F-18 contained volatile Fluodd compounds (presumably Freones). Meanwhile more than 130 patients could be examined with FDG produced by MicroLab without any side effects. Using the GEMS MicroLab the availibility of FDG will improve with good quality of the tracer.

We now report the biodistribution data of 1-131 labeled Zn(II)-PC-DPPC in mice bearing fibrosarcomas in the thigh (N=20). The uptake of this compound in tumor (T) , thyroid (TR) , liver (L) , kidne Z (K) and muscle The rapid uptake in tumor, which remained constant upto 90h, is similar to previously published data for the unlabeled compound in the same animal model. The elevated T/M ratios as well as the satisfactory tumor to normal (liver and kidney) and target (thyroid) organ ratios suggest the potential use of PC as carriers of long lived radionuclides for tumor therapy. The development of 99mTc complexes with receptor binding characteristics is one of the present challenges in synthetic radiopharmaeeutical chemistry.

Because of its anti-tumour properties, we have examined the binding of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFec) to turnout cells in vivo and in vitro. In our laboratory a new magnetic separation radioimmunoassay has been developed for measurement of TNF~. Thereafter the radiolabelled TNF~ was used in radiobioassay. The parameters of the RIA a r e as follows: specific activity of tracer 7-8000 kBq//ug, sensitivity: 10 pg/ml, NSB: 1-2 %, B/B o 40-50 % (at dilution of antibody: 6000), recovery: 90-95 %, measuring range of assay: 0-104 pg/ml, time of assay: 24 hours.

For radiobioassay, labelled TNF=\u00a2, specific activity: 2-3000 kBq//ug TNF,\u00a2 ,was injected intravenously into tumourbearing m=ce, and the distribution of tracer was followed 1, 2 and 3 hours after i.v. injection. The highest level of radioactivity (9-12% of injected activity) in tumour tissue was detected by 2 hours of i.v. injection. In vitro studies of 125-I-TNF~ binding to tumour cells were performed on Calu-1 cell culture (a line established from human lung carcinoma). 125-I-TNF=\u00a2 (37 kBq/2000 U/ml) was added to the proliferating cells at various time-points of culturing. By measurement of bound radioactivity, information was obtained on the ability of cultured tumour cells to bind TN~ in the control experiments and also after the effect of ionizing radiation (0.25-4 Gy). Radiation-induced cell membrane perturbation was followed by dose-dependent changes in TN~: binding, too. The applied RIA method seems to be suitable for determination of the concentration of TNF~. in sera. 125-I-TNF,\u00a2showed high localization in tumour tissue and slow blood disappearance. The purpose of the study: In past few years in 16 patients (pts.) under the radiation therapy the acute radiation pneumonitis (ARP) was discovered. In 9 patients with the small cell lung cancer (SCLC), in 5 with breast cancer and in two wdth Hodgkin's disease the prescribed doses were 46 and 60 Gy (in 11 pts. the therapy was finished). Nearly few years we tried to test the secretion of APUD endocrine cells in patients under the radiation therapy, to see if the levels of neurotransmitters may indicate the radiation damages.

Both assays showed an excellent overall correlation (r=l.0) for the range from 0.1-3500 ng PSA/ml. This was also found for the range from 0.1-4.0 ng/ml (n=224), the slope beeing almost 1.0 with a minimal offset : ACS = 0.94 x Hybritech + 0.11 (r=o.94). Looking for the range from 4.0 -20.0 ng/ml (n=81) the r-value decreased to r = 0.88 and the slope went up: ACS = 1.43 x Hybritech + 0175. Selecting the values between 20 and 3500 ng/ml (n=123) the slope was lower and the offset greater: ACS = 1.27 x Hybritech + 7.2.

On the other hand after a long period of high inter-assay compatibility for PSA values the new technique of ACS to estimate also uncomplexed PSA makes it necessary to label the results of each PSA estimation with the name of the applied kit. The. development of fully automated analyzers that performs immunological tests using the ELISA principle, is an atmcfive option to change the methodology of those tests from IRMA to ELISA. In the follow-up of the patients it is imperative that the values deternfined for the tnmour markers levels by the different methods should b e comparable, In order to solve this problem we have analysed the values of CEA and CA 19-9 determined in l 11 and 129 sel\"um sanlples respectively by both methods and distributed along all the extension of the curves and including also diluted samples of those serums which values were superior to the last point of the curves, CEA:We considered two levels of CEA vahies, superior and inferior to 7 ng/nfl in IRMA.The differences of the IRMA and ELISA values were \"nlarginally\" different fl'om zero (paired t lest, s.l. =0.05) for the low level (<7 ng/ml), and not significantly different from zero for the high level values (> 7 ng/ml), and for the lo|ality of the values, CA 19-9: For this parameter we considered tin'ee levels 0-37, 37-240 and >240 ng/nfl.The differences of |he values obtained by IRMA and ELISA were re17 significantly different fl'om zero for the low level vahles of the pm'anleter, \"not significantly\" for the medium level and \" marginally\" different for the high values ( paired t tes, s.l,=0.05 ).For lhe totality of the values the difference is also \"mm'ginally\" different fl'om zero. The results showing differences between the paired values that were superior to the acceptable errors of either method indicates the necessity of study correlations between both values and to establish correlation expressions, chic correlations were all statistically significant ( | test of correlation coefficient, r ). The linear and logariflmlic correlation expressions obtained for the different levels of hmmur markers are presented and discussed.",

However, 1-131 Sc may fail to show metastases in subjects despite concurrent high thyroglobuline plasma levels. To assess the use of [F-18]FDG scintigraphy (PET)for ThC metastasis detection, we compared 1-131 and [F-18]FDG scintigraphy in 12 patients with known ThC suspicious for metastatic disease prior to consecutive 1-131 therapy Patients underwent both whole-body 1-131Sc with 740MBq 1-131, and [F-18]FDG scintigraphy with 3700MBq [F-18]FDG. PET scans were performed to obtain bidimensional images of either the superior or inferior part of the body and tomographic images of the region where the presence of metastases was suggested by standard methods, including MDP scans or X-ray. The number of lesions observed by the 1-13l Sc and PET in the same field of view was reported by three different observers.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS. /~2-microglobulin (B2M) is a low molecular weight protein present on the surface of many somatic ceils, including T and B lymphocytes. Stimulation of lymphoid cells can increase serum levels of B2M. Serum B2M concentrations therefore seem to reflect the degree of immune-system activation. Several studies have suggested that that quantification of B2M might be useful in the prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, showing that high concentrations of it are predictors of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS",

In this population radiological investigations may not demonstrate if bone lesions are expression of an acute infection. Ninenteen diabetic patients (15M; 4F; mean age 62+/-7 yrs) were studied with 99m-Tc-HMPAO leukocytes because of the suspicion of foot infection. Scans were obtained at 4 and 24 hr after the injection of labeled leukocytes (185-370 MBq 99mTcoHMPAO). Seventeen patients had positive scintigrams and two had negative scans for infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgical control, histologic findings or by clinical follow-up. In one case leukocyte scan showed infection in spite of a negative bacterial culture by wad. In one case a clinically unknown site was detected. In five patients the study was repeated after clinical and/or surgical therapy : 4 showed an improvement and 1 had a post therapy abscess. In all patients studied antibiotic or surgical therapy was decided also following leukoeytes scan indications. In conclusion, 99m-Tc-HMPAO leukooytes sointigraphy had high accuracy in detecting localization and extention of infected loci, in particular it showed if the infective process interests only soft tissue or even bone tissue. The main clinical consequence of this accuracy is the possibility of performing, when surgery is necessary, a conservative approach. 306 C. Aktolun, W. Yu.Ussov, A. Arka, D. Glas s, R.

LILLE, MONTPELLIER, CAEN, BORDEAUX -GRIO (Groupe de Recherche et d'lnformation sur les Ost4oporoses) QUALITY ASSURANCE AND BONE ABSORPTIOMETRY When medical imaging aims towards in vivo measurement, assurance of quality gains a particular interest : actually, the concepts of accuracy, of precision or of reproducibility of measurement are far from the concepts of contrast, of field homogeneity or of sharpness of the image. We describe here how we set up a national quality assurance in this field. Assurance quality has been built up from three projects ' -absoJ'ptiometry workshops : they use both theoretical and practical approaches, in order to make physicians aware of the difficulties of the measurements they perform or of the limits of their clinical interpretation. Through 10 such workshops, more than 180 physicians have been concerned at this time. -elementary fantoms have been designed in order to appraise each feature of absorptiometers and to characterize their l i m i t s . Short and long term reproducibility, accuracy, linearity, homogeneity, soft tissue effects are so studied. Such phantoms arc currently circulating through absorptiometric centers (more than 20 centers reached at this time). Hydroxyapatite samples of various quite definite densities are then used in b l i n d studies to check the quality of the measurements. -relying upon the confidence of measurements in the involved centers, multicentric clinical studies arc running.324 J.

DM derivatives eluted as two, probably diastereomeric species (A,B).The TM derivatives occurred as a single radiochemical compound. In mice al derivatives cleared rapidly from the blood. The increased lipophilicity of the new derivatives resulted in a marked rise of the amount cleared by the hepatobiliary system. 30 min p.i. about 35% of the i.d. of the 99mTc-TMEC complexes and 16% to 32 % for three of the DM derivatives (L,L-A; D,D-A; D,D-B) was found in liver and intestines. 99mTc-L,L-DMEC-B, on the other hand, showed a surprisingly low hepatobiliairy handling (4.6% of i.d. 30 rain p.i.), only slightly higher than that of 99mTc-L,L-EC (2.1% of i.d. 30 min p.i.). The activity in the urine 30 min p.i. for 99mTc-L,L-DMEC-B was similar to that of 99mTc-L,L-EC (90% of i.d. 30 min p.i.) and much higher than that of the other DM derivatives (61% to 72% of i.d. 30 min p.i.) and TM derivatives (45% to 47% of i.d. 30 min p.i.).

Aims: assessment of heart perfusion disturbances in LED by means of heart perfusion scinfigraphy with Tc99 -MIBI. The test was performed in 25 women with e s t a b l ished diagnosis of LED (4 -9 c r i t e r i o n s of ARA), 12 with p o s i t i v e and 13 with negative exercise t e s t . Both subgroups were comparable in aspects of age (mean 40.1 +/-4.7 years) and duration of disease (4.9 years). Heart p~rfusion scintigraphy was performed with the use of TcgT\"-MIBI with the use of gamma-camera DC4 (Picker) The investigations were performed in the LAD45, ANT, LLAT projections in a standard protocol of exercise and rest.Segmental perfusion defects were seen in 80 % of patients, mostly l o c a l i s e d in a n t e r i o r and posterol a t e r a l heart wall. These changes were mostly r e v e r s i -ble at r e s t . Perfusion defects were seen in 9/13 (69 %) and in 11/12 (92 %) patients with p o s i t i v e exercise t e s t . Conclusions: Subclinical perfusion defects are frequent in LEO, also in patients without open c l i n i c a l manifest a t i o n s of ischemic heart disease. EKG exercise t e s t may not be s e n s i t i v e enough in cardiolegical diagnostics and negative r e s u l t does not exclude cardiac perfusion defects. Cardiac perfusion scintigraphy may prove superior to other tests in diagnosing patients with LED, because of possibly d i f f e r e n t psthogenetic mechanisms involved, similar to those of silent myocardial ischemia in diabetes. suggest a direct effect of m o d i f i e d LDL on P G -b i n d i n g onto monocytes.

A high mean value of early and delayed uptake with low retention index in patients with high grade astrocytoma in both postoperative residual and recurrent groups, versus lower mean value of early and delayed uptake with high retention index in the low grade tumours. All postoperative cases with high grade and high 201TI uptake >1.5, whereas 66.6% of cases with low grade had low 201TI uptake <1.5. A correlation between retention index of 201TI and tumour grade (r=0.47). Also, recurrent cases showed remarkable difference in early and delayed 201T1 uptake (P<0.05) and retention index (P<0.001) as compared to post radiation gliosis. Also, higher sensitivity in detection oftumour viability in second group (100%) versus 80% in CT scamling in differentiation between recurrent tumour and post radiation gliosis Conelusion:TI-201 can be used in differentiation of low and high grade astrocytoma and in differentiation between recurrent tumour and postradiation gliosis 514 N.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF LUNG/HEART RATIO OF In-111 HIG IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS: RESULTS OF A MULTICENTRE TRIALPatients with AIDS (the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) have a high mortality and morbidity from lung infections. Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. In-111 labeled pooled human IgG (In-111 HIG) has bean proposed as an effective method for early diagnosis of lung infection in these patients. The aim of this study was to use a quntitative approach to verify that AIDS patients with lung infection have increased lung uptake of In-111HIG. This lung/heart (L/H) ratio was calculated from anterior and posterior images of the chest performed, in 106 individuals, 12 hours after the administration of 37MBq of In-111 HIG. The mean age of the patients studied was 32 (range 17-64),, 24 were healthy volunteers without AIDS, 32 had Pneumocystsis carinii pneumonia, 18 had lung infection from ther pathogens and 32 had no evidence of active lung infection.The resulting mean L/H ratio (+/-s.d.) for each group was as follows <0.001 ................................................... *unpaired t test In Conclusion this study providas objective evidence that there is more lung activity of In-111 HIG in AIDS patients with lung infection than in those without. In-111 HIG imaging at 24 hours can be recommended in these patients. Chr.Reiners, J.Biko, W.Bauer, K.Wuttke, C.Streffer, G.Voigt, H.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON 931 CONSECUTIVE EVALUATIONS OF 785 PATIENTS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of TG measurement and WBS in the management of patients with DTC. 785 patients (181 male and 604 female) with histological diagnosis of DTC [623 papillary and 162 follicular carcinoma) were consecutively submitted to WBS and simoultaneous assay of TG, antiTG and TSH, in the period going from ist November 1992 to 31st December 1993. 255 evaluations were done after surgical intervention and before 131-I ablation of thyroid remnants (Group A). In the other 676 cases the exams were performed after 131-I ablation of thyroid remnants (Group B).The results of the examinations in the two ~roups are reported in Tables 1 and 2. WBS and TG were discordant in 29.6% of the cases. The cases with WBS positive and TG negative in Group B were due to extracervical uptakes in six cases. Had WBS not been performed in these last patients, the 131-I treatment might have been inappropriately delayed. The significance for prognosis and survival of an high TG with negative WBS in DTC is still uncertain. The analysis of this large series of patients suggests the need for caution in leaving aside WBS in DTC patients.

Antibiotic prophylaxis was sistematicaUy performed from VUR diagnosis. Urino cultures were negative in all patients. Renal damage was quantified by relative uptake (RU) at 2 min. from i.v. injection of 20 MBq ofTc-99m-MAG3. Kidneys with uptake of at least 43% were considered normal, those with uptake between 43 and 25% slightly damaged, and those with uptake of less than 25% severely damaged.

H6r University Medical Center, Frankfurt/Main, Germany Biomira Research Inc., Edmonton, Canada IMMUNOTHERAPY BY HAMA INDUCTION IMPROVES SURVIVAL OF OVARIAN CANCERIn patients (pts) with advanced stages of ovarian carcinoma (OVCA) receiving radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against CA 125 for diagnostic purposes, a better survival rate than expected was observed by our group and others. A more detailed analysis of the effects caused by the injection of the MAb revealed that the better prognosis was linked to the rise of human anti-mouse antibodies in these pts. The present study was undertaken to evaluate these effects in a larger patient population. The intact Tc-99m labeled anti-CA 125 MAb B43.13 (Biomira, Edmonton, Canada) was injected repeatedly (161 injections) into 63 pts suffering from recurrent OVCA. Serum HAMA titers (anti-isotypic and anti-idiotypic antibodies) were measured at monthly intervals. 53% of pts developed HAMA after the first injection and all (except one) became HAMA positive after 3 injections. The HAMA response was very variable in the individual patient (titers from 1,000 to >500,000 ng/ml, normal cut-off 220 ng/ml). The repeated injections (ling dose) were well tolerated (only two allergic reactions which needed medical intervention). No toxic long term effects were observed. Compared to control (n=6170 patients), the 1-yr survival rate (SR) for ovarian cancer FIGO III stages was 95% vs. 77% (control), 2-yr SR was 90% vs. 50%, 3-yr SR was 73% vs. 38% and 4-yr survival 57% vs 30% (Kaplan-Meier analysis; p<0.002 ). Most of the pts showed a stable course of the disease under immunotherapy, in few cases also tumor regressions were observed. These effects might be caused by induction of anti-idiotypic antibodies which trigger a host therapeutic effects directed against the tumor. HAMA also induce T cell activation directed against the tumor cells. A prospective, randomized multicentric study in patients at high risk for recurrence of ovarian carcinoma, including patients with minimal residual disease or NED after second Iook surgery, is going to start soon.

Additional studies were done with a REF -catheter which is a special designed variation of Swan-C-anz catheter for assessment of RVEF by thermodilution. The aim of this study was to compare CSC and REF simultaneously assessed RVEF for evaluation of their clinical reliability. In 10 septic patients of the intensive care unit (age 42 -65y) on artificial respiration right heart catheterisation with a REF -Catheter and CSC continuous monitoring of RVEF was performed. 56 REF-RVEF(44+/-10 %) values were correlated to CSC-RVEF (45+/-9 %). As expected correlation was highly significant (p < 0.001) the correlation coefficient (r = 0.64 ),however, was relatively low due to the wide scatter of the REF.-RVEF in contrast to the stable CSC -RVEF values over wide periods. In conclusion: CSC provides continuously stable accurate assessment of RVEF even under conditions of artificial respiration. REF-RVEF values however were characterised by a wide scatter within short haemodynamically stable periods. Thus CSC-RVEF appears as a more reliable tool for evaluation of right ventricular function even if right heart catheterisatlon seems necessary for pressure monitoring.",

In the present study our first experiences with rnurine MAb BW 431/2 (Behringwerke AG) have been described. We investigated postsurgically thirteen patients (pts) with high clinical suspicion of recurrent or metastatic CC. Each patient received a single intravenous infusion of 0,65-I,0 nag anti-CEA BW 431/26 MAb labeled with 814-1110 MBq of Tc-99m. Whole-body and SPECT scans were acquired at 4-6 hours and 20-24 hours post infusion. Radioimmunoscintigraphic (RIS) findings were verified surgically, and/or clinically. On a per patient basis, RIS demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 85%.",

All patients fulfilled DSM-III criteria and were on prescribed medication. SPECT images were acquired after iv. injection of 20 mCi 99m-Tc-HMPAO using a dual head rotating gamma camera. Following reconstruction and attenuation correction, coronal, sagittal and reoriented transversal slices (parallel to the orbitomeatal line) were obtained. Thirty-two ROI's were drawn in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum for semiquantitative analysis, normalized to the mean cerebral uptake. Only regional asymmetries >15% were considered abnormal.17 patients showed regional hypoperfusion abnormalities in frontal, parietal and temporal lobes (10 with negative SCH and 7 with unipolar depression), and 8 patients had no changes in rCBF (5 with negative SCH and 3 with unipolar depression). There were 23 regional hypoperfusion abnormalities in patients with negative SCH and 22 regional hypoperfusion abnormalities in patients with unipolar depression, almost all (except 3 hypopeffusions in 2 depressed patients) localized in left dominant hemisphere. Statistical analysis (2-tail Student's test, p>0.05) showed no significant differences between SCH and depressed patients..In conclusion, we found that 99m'Tc-HMPAO-SPECT could be usefull and sensible tool to diagnose rCBF abnormalities, but not for differentiation between patients with negative schizophrenia and unipolar depression. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of this findings. ",

In this study, we looked for a correlation between some common symptoms and cerebral perfusion abnormalities in atypical psychiatric patients. 20 patients (mean age: 43; 13 M, 7 F) were included in the study. Brain SPECTs were performed after intravenous injection of 15-20 mCi of Tc-99m HMPAO, using a single detector, rotating gamma camera, with eyes and ears closed, in a quiet room. Tomographic slices were evaluated visually. 32 decreased perfusion areas in 20 brains were detected. Distribution of the lesions was as follows: 50% left frontal (LF) codex, 30% in left temporal (LT) codex. 13% right temporal (RF) cortex, 7% right frontal (RF) codex. Lesions were grouped as inthe Patients with psycotic symptoms 1 (12.5%) 2 (40%) 2 (67%) 4 (100%)Major symptoms were 1) depressive mood (DM), 2) social isolation (SI), 3) decreased performance (DP), 4) psychomotor retardation (PR), 5) hallucinations (H), 6) delusions (D). In patients who have LF cortex hypoperfusion the most common symptoms were DP (13.4%), DM (11%) and SI (11%). We observed a tendency for H and D to be related to temporal codex lesions.In conclusion, it seems that solitary LF hypoperfusions tended to be with DM, SI, DP and with less probability of psycotic symptoms, while additional and temporal lesions alone were likely to be related to psycotic symptoms. Three patients with temporal lesions had a final clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia which might suggest that brain perfusion scanning can predict the possible outcome in dealing with atypical patients. Biersaek. In patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, the mostly recent PET studies suggest an involvement of the frontal lobes and the basal ganglia. To evaluate rCBF by means of SPECT and to relate the findings to clinical variables (psychopathology, duration of disease, medication) we investigated 15 patients using high resolution SPECT (ASPECT, FWHM 5-6 mm) and ~mTe-HMPAO as a tracer. In addition to visual evaluation, ROIs were drawn on the mesial and lateral, the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. The mean age was 37 + 11.3 years, the mean duration of disease ranged about 14.6 + ]-0.7 years. The Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y--BOCS) was used to quantify psychopathological symptoms. Only one patient demonstrated a normal SPECT. In 13 subjects a reduced regional perfusion was observed, while 6 patients showed an increased regional perfusion. The diminished perfusion clearly lateralized to the right side (16 right, 8 left). The predominantly affected region was the temporal lobe (6 right, 3 left). In contrast, the hyperperfusion did not show major side differences (3 right prefrontal region, 4 left prefrontal region) . It was mainly confined to the prefrontal area. Thus, our preliminary findings further suggest an involvement of frontal lobe structures in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. Moreover, our results demonstrate hypoperfusion of the temporal lobe as it has been observed in other psychiatric diseases. Due to the number of patients evaluated up to now, valuable statistics correlating the SPECT findings to clinical variables could not be established yet.

MAb B72.3, a murine IgGl reactive with human carcinoma antigen TAG-72, was labeled with Re-188 by a direct conjugation using tin as a reduction agent. The MAb was also labeled with 1-125 by Chloramine-T method. In melanoma patients without apparent lymph node metastases, the S.N. procedure allows us to identify those who have micrometastases and need regional lymph node dissection (R.N.L.D.). We investigated the gamma detection probe and patent blue (P.B.) for this purpose. In 9 patients with clinically localized melanoma with a mean Breslow thickness of 2.3 mm (range 1.1 mm-4.7 ram) the SN identification and biopsy procedure was carried out. Approximately 60 MBq of 99m Tcnanocolloid was injected intradermally in the margins of the turnout or at the previous tumor site and shortly thereafter the first lymphoscintigram was made. The first visualized lymph node (S.N.) was then marked on the skin. The next day P.B. was injected shortly before operation at the same location as the 99mTc-nanocolloid. The number of identified S.N. with the gamma camera was 15. During operation we identified 11 out of 14 S.N. visually by its blue discoloration and 14 out of 14 with a gamma detection probe (Neoprobe 1000). The mean S.N. to background (BKG) ratio intra-operatively was 73.2 (range 3.5-359) and the mean S.N./BKG ratio ex vivo was 1125 (range 70-3957). The mean percentage of injected dose per gram tissue was 1.36 (range 0.02-5.37). Frozen section microscopy performed during surgery revealed in 2 patients micrometastases. Both patients underwent RLND. Conclusion: Accuracy and reliability of this method appear to be very high. When carried out in a larger number of patients this procedure might be useful in the selection of patients for RLND or whether a waitand-see policy can be followed. ",

Coles and Dickett were able to demonstrate in the rat its irmocuousness in doses up to 1000 times the quantities applied in normal medical use (personal communication). The aim of this study was to test this observation in humans, both as to stability and harmlessness.Thirty-four patients gave their consent to participate in the study. Ceretec \u00b0 was obtained from 3.7 GBq fresh Tc-pertectmetate from the 2nd generator elution (2 types of generators were used). Cobalt chloride (200 ug/2 ml) were added 2 rain alter reconstruction. Thirty patients were injected with 0.9 to 1.3 GBq of Tc-HM-PAO reconstituted for less than 2 hours. The cerebral tomography was started 20 rain. after. Moreover, in 4 extra patients, leucocytes were labelled with more than one hour old tracer, the yield of the labelling being measured. Clinical parameters were followed up to 24 hours after injection. The images obtained were compared both visually and quantitatively (in the brain studies: distribution within the brain and the brain/soft, tissue proportion) to those obtained in a control group, matched for age and sex, and using non-stabilised Tc-HM-PAO, injected within 30 min.No toxicity or other side effects were noticed. There was no significant difference between the images of both groups. The yield of leucocyte labelling was statistically unaltered.The use of cobalt chloride as a stabilising agent for Tc-HM-PAO, proved, within the scope of this study, to be elficacious in routine application and harmless for the patient. rnsulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are peptides that express anabolic and mitogenic activity on fetal, postnatal and transformed cells. In serum, IGF's circulate bound to IGF-binding proteins ( IGFBPs... mostly IGFBP-3 ) which modulate their proliferative action. Several adenocarcinoma secrete IGFBP's and express binding sites for them.Purified glycosylated human recombinant IGFBP-3 (42kDa) was labelled with 1-125 and injected into non-anaesthetized rats.Concentration-time profiles were studied in blood and various organs.Autoradiography was done on major organs of localization.Urine and blood samples were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography.Over 80% of the blood pool activity cleared by 30 min. Gel permeation chromatography revealed radioactivity retained in the blood pool was bound in the 150 kDa ternary complex normally found in plasma. Blood pool activity decreased to 4% by 6 hours and 0.7% at 24 hours. Liver and kidney activity peaked at l0 minutes with 24% and 5.8% respectively.In humans, the liver acts as the major site of IGF production.The majority of the 12.8% in the stomach at 2 hours was present in the contents.Less than 1% id was in the GIT and contents by 24 hours.Autoradiography of liver samples indicated localization in Kupffer cells.In humans the mRNA for IGFBP-3 has been shown to exist in Kupffer cells. Autoradiography revealed the major kidney localization was in the glomerulus and distal tubules. Gel permeation chromatography of i0 minute urine samples indicated the protein renally excreted had been metabolized to lower molecular weight forms (<18kDa). In the stomach most of the radioactivity was localized in the epithelial mucosa. Some localization was also evident in the smooth muscle of stomach and small intestine.Somatostatin was previously found to have an improved biodistribution (|renal, |hepatobiliary clearance) when labelled via bifunctional chelates rather than radioiodine. Further studies are planned on tumour bearing animals and with IGFBP's radiolabelled with bifunctional chelates. The cerbB2 oncogene was proposed as a prognostic indicator in human breast cancer. In this study we evaluated 4 methods to measure the cerbB2 protein expression in order: a) to compare two IRMA kits (ELISA, Oncogene Science (ONC) and EIA, Triton Diagnostic (TRIT)), with the immunohistochemical assay (IHC) and Western blotting (WB); b) to compare the relationships between cerbB2 protein levels obtained with the different methods used and some other parameters. Tissue samples from 250 patients with primary breast cancer were partly formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for IHC (mAb clone 3B5 -ONC) and partly pulverized and homogenized in phosphate buffer. The homogenates were in part lysated and assayed for WB and ONC assays and in part ultracentrifuged. The pellets were lysated and used for TR1T assay. Positivity rates with IHC was 28.5%. We categorized samples analyzed with WB, ONC and TRIT as overexpressing (OEx) and no-OEx (-) using a cut-off obtained from non-malignant specimens. Using the second cut-off the positivity was 28%,26% and 28% respectively. The differences between the 4 methods were not significative (Cochran Q test: p= 0.677) The concordance rates range between 76% (WB vs TRIT) and 90% (ONC vs IHC). 78% of the low-OEx samples identified by WB and TRIT and 93% identified by ONC were negative with IHC. The relationships between erbB2 and both ER and PR showed an inverse association, independent of the method used. However, ONC and TRIT showed direct correlation between CerbB2 and both ER and PR in erbB2(-) samples, and an indirect one in cerbB2(+)/(++) samples. All the methods showed a trend toward higher positivity rates of erbB2 in samples with more than 3 positive lymphnodes. Moreover, in the cerbB2 (+)/(++) group assayed by ONC and WB higher cerbB2 levels in N+ then N-samples were found, while an inverse trend was found in erbB2(-) samples. In conclusion, the four methods results seem to disclose confident correlation indexes. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether SPECT studies using 5-[~=~I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (~IUdR) produce the same results.",

            "text": "In this method, mouse brain microsomes, from cerebral cortex, were coated onto a zone of a TLC strip, the unreacted sites blocked with gelatin, and the test radiopharmaceuticals (100 -500 K cpm) chromatographed over the brain materials. Brain reactive materials bound to the microsomes and were separated from the unreacted materials by the mobile phase (PBS containing 60% serum and 4% ethanol). Strips coated with gelatin (no microsomes) were used to assess non-specific binding.Using this format, Tc-99m-HMPO was found to interact with the microsomes (63%) whereas the kidney imaging agent Tc-99m-MAG3 did not (3%). Tc-99m-ethy1 cysteinate interacted poorly (9.9%), a result consistent with its known inability to be metabolized by nonprimate brain tissue. In-I 11-DTPA-octreotide was also bound (up to 25 %). Other experimental peptide radiopharmaceuticals (Tc-99moctreotide and a Tc-99m-Iaminin-derived peptide) were also found to bind to the microsomes. Binding tO the negative control strip was consistantly low and frequently below 5%.In this assay, there are neither wash steps nor centrifugation steps, and assays can be completed within 15 minutes. The assay may be useful in monitoring of the interaction of established and experimental brain imaging agents with brain tissue. Multiple neuroreceptor changes are present in Alzheimer disease (AD); in particular, a consistent loss of nicotinic receptors in cortical tissue was reported. For future clinical studies with SPET we aimed at labeling a ligand with 123I and with sufficient specific activity. 1-3 mg 5-bromonlcotine were autoclaved for 60 ~ with 123I-NaI in the presence of 1 mg copper chloride and glacial acetic acid (pH 4.7). The labeling efficiency was 69 %, the radiochemical purity exceeded 95 % (I-~LC and thin layer chromatography). A specific activity of 180 GBq/mmote was obtained by H~LC separation of the excess of 5bromo-nicotine in the reaction mixture (RP 18 Eurospher 80 C18; methanol:10 mM phosphate buffer = 45:55). This product (H) and another one with lower specific activity of 0.2 GBq/mmole (L) were used for autoradiographlc studies in a series of rat brain slices, in order to determine the binding patterns as compared with that of 3H-nicotine. For physical reasons, for this comparison 125I-Nat was used. H showed autoradiographlc pattern similar to tlmt of 3H-nicotine with accumulation in cortex, hippocampus and thalanaic nuclei. With L, these structures were not identified. Conclusion: The described procedure for 1-123-1abeling of nicotine yields high specific activity. This high activity proved to be not only sufficient, but also essential to allow the compound to bind specifically to nicotinergic receptors. Monographs of radiopharmaceuticals (RP's) included in the European Pharmacopoeia (Eur.Ph.) indicate the ener~l~ for the most characteristic gamma photon in order to perfor~ the radionuclidic purity test. This test can be carried out by any suitable instrument,being the NaI(TI) detector the most used at hospital level. In the radionuclidic purity test of RP's labelled with 75Se and lllIn a sain peak over 400 keV, not defined as characteristic for these radionuclides, is obtained by using a 3\" NaI(T1) through-hole type detector; this unexpected peak has a fractional count rate higher than 50% of the total count rate of the spectrum of both radionuclides. However testing the same samples by using a 2\" NaI(TI) detector coupled to a 256 multichannel analyzer system the contribution from the abnormal peak tot he total count rate registered in the whole spectrum is lower (11.5% for 75Se and 3.4% for lllIn) and decreasing to negligible values when the source to detector distance is increased. These unexpected peaks are explained as an artifact due to the coincidence summing peak effect. This effect occurs with radionuclides emitting two or more cascade photons within the resolving time of the detector. The most important consecuence of this artifact is the possibility of concluding a poor radionuclidic purity for some RP's. Therefore the possibility of the sum peak effect should be advised in the Euro Ph. in the specific monographs for RP's for wich this effect is known.",

            "text": "Separation in fractions of high cost kits is a common practice in Radiopharmacies. We have observed that good radiochemical purity (RCP) of Cardiolite cannot be obtained simply by separation in fractions and stored at -20 \u00b0C. Since, we found that after 24 hrs of dividing the RCP of the frozen aliquots was low. Moreover, the results depended on the perteclmetate activity, RCP: 86+9% with 1073_+333 MBq (n=6), 74_+8% with 2516_+444 MBq (n=3), 55_+4% with 5661_+111 MBq (n=3). These results were different from those obtained without dividing the Cardiolite and following the kit instructions, RCP:97.3 _-t-1.5 % (n = 15). Smaller quantities of the reducing agent in the aliquots, or damage when handling, could be the reason of the low RCP. Accordingly, we have studied the effect of adding Sn \u00f72. The time expensive labelling process of radioactive labelled thrombocytes is a disadvantage in clinical usage. Also omitting certain steps the time i for the whole process needs more than 45 minutes. The reasons, why this process is time consuming, are the repeated centrifugation steps to separate the blood cells and the recommended low acceleration value (max. 1000 g) to avoid the damage of thrombocytes. The aim of our work was to reduce the labelling time through optimisation the steps of centrifugiation with Higher A_cceleration _Short Time (HAST)centrifugation. With short-time exeeding the recommended 1000 g and a reduced tube filling (shorter sedimentation path) we determined the possible time reducing factor and the possible damage of platelets. The blood cells from 25 ml ACD-blood was selected by a first HASTcentrifugation (3 min, 3000 U/rain, max.1500 g, 25 ml Monovette, 25 mm Diameter). The PRP was then transferred in a 50 ml tube followed by a second HAST-centrifugation (3 min, 3000 U/rain, max. 1500 g). The sedimented thrombocytes were redisperged and incubated ( 5 min, 37 \u00b0(3) with 111-1n-Oxinat. After adding of 10 ml buffer solution the labelled thrombocytes were be selected by a third HAST-centrifugation (3 rain, 3000 U/rain, max. 1500 g). The following parameters were determined: Tc-99m human serum albumin (HSA)has been used in nuclear medicine for almost 30 years. However, Tc-99m HSA is not an optimal radiopharmaceutical due to its in-vivo instability. The purpose of our study was to develop and evaluate a new method for labelling HSA, A hexadentate nitrogen-donor che]ating ligand N, N, N', N'-tetrakis (2-benzymidazolylmethyl)', 2-ethanediamine (EDTB) was synthesized by condensation of t.2-benzenediamine and ethylene-diaminete-traacetic acid (EDTA) in glycol for 20 hours followed by precipitation of the crude product with water and purification by reorystallization from hot absolute ethanol, The EDTB-HSA was prepared by mixing HSA and EDTB solutions and incubating the soluation at room temperature for 2 hours. The conjugated EDTB-HSA was separated and purified by PD-IO gel chromatography, and was a d d e d into S n ( I I ) solution, which was dispensed into vials. The labelling efficiency and in-vivo stability test of Tc-ggm EDTB-HSA were performed with ITLC. The labelling efficiency was 92.88%, The in-vivo stability was 91.19% (1 hr), 90.63% (2 hrs), 88.93% (3 hrs), 88,42~ (4 hrs) and 85.37% (B hrs), respectively.Our preliminary study revealed the quality of EDTB-HSA was superior to the currently used commercial HSA kit, and EDTB was a potential method for labelling various protein, The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate Ga-67-DTPA for the scintigraphic visualization of experimental abscesses in comparison to Ga-67 citrate. The biodistributions of both radiopharmaceuticals (RP's) were determined in mice with abscesses induced by turpentine 6 days previously in right thigh muscle. After i.v. injection of 3.7 MBq, the mice were sacrificed at 1,3, 6, and 24 h and scintigraphic images were obtained All the organs, the abscess, some muscle, blood and urine when available were obtained, weighed and counted. % uptake/g tissues and abscess/muscle (NM), blood (A/B), intestine (A/I), liver (A/L) and kidney (A/K) ratios were calculated. Normal distribution of each RP was determined after i.v. administration of 37 MBq in 3 rabbits by scintigraphic imaging up to 24 h. The abscesses were visualized with both RP's starting at 3 h. The max. A/M, A/B, A/I, A/L, and A/K ratios were 6.66+0.63 (3 h), 8.63+0.77 (3 h), 2.60+0.10 (3 h), 1.57+0.12 (6 h) and 1.20+0.36 (3 h) for Ga-67-DTPA, and 4.97+2.00 (6 h), 5.24+0.37 (24 h), 2.01+0.37 (24 h), 1.09+0.76 (6 h) and 0.914_-+0.616 (6 h) for Ga-67-citrate, respectively. On normal scintigrams of rabbits the kidneys and the urinary bladder were visualized with some blood background with Ga-67-DTPA.In conclusion, Ga-67-DTPA is preferred to Ga-67-citrate, because of higher concentration ratios attained earlier and predominant excretion via kidneys. Experimental models of myocardial perfusion study are of paramount importance to select new radiopharmaceuticals for scintigraphic imaging evaluation of coronary artery disease. Aims of this study are addressed to evaluate: a) the biodistribution comparison results of some new tracers; b) their relative myocardium retention mechanism. a) The use of myocardial perfusion agents for the detection of areas of reduced blood flow, is dependent, at least in part, upon the single pass extraction of the respective probe compound. In Tab. 1 the behaviour of some compounds at this respect is reported in a comparative way.[ b) The mechanism of cellular uptake and retention is the fundamental pattern for understanding the clinical meaning of scintigraphic images. In Tab The study of the mechanism of cellular retention of these agents, have shown that neither ]ipophilic properties nor the cathionic charge alone are sufficient to characterize the biologic properties of these complexes. Calichemicins belong to a new class of potent antitumor antibiotics which contain a polysubstituted aromatic carboxylic acid fragment. Analogs of the fragment containing iodine have been synthesized. A methylester, Methyl 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-2,3-dimethexy-6-methylbenzoate, was synthesized by van Laak and Scharf (Tetrahedron 45: 5511, 1989) , and was kindly supplied by Prof. H-D Scharf of the Institute fur Organische Chemie der RWTH Aachen, Germany. The acid fragment is released following hydrolysis of the ester. We investigated biological behavior of the two compounds using radionuclide tracer techniques. In the present study, iodine-131 was used to label the monoiodo methylester by exchange reactions (the yield was over 90%). The radioiodinated ester was then hydrolyzed to obtain the acid form retaining 1-131. Biodistribution studies in mice were carried out with these two labeled compounds. Animals were sacrificed at different times (3 and i0 min, and i, 4 and 24 hr) following intravenous injections into tail veins. Organs were obtained, and assayed for radioactivity. Tissue distributions of these two labeled compounds were entirely different. Initial uptake in the liver, kidneys and the Gl-tract was high for the ester. On the contrary, initial uptake of the labeled acid was high in the kidneys, and over 90% of radioactivity was cleared from the body in 4 hours via urinary excretion.Its biodistribution was similar to that of Tc-99m labeled DTPA, as confirmed by carrying out tracer studies in mice under similar conditions. This might be useful as a radioiodinated glomerular agent for clinical applications when interfering radionuclides are present.",
