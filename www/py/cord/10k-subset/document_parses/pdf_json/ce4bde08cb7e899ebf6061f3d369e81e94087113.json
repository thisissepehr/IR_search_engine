Some of these agents exert protective effects in different inflammatory disorders such as septic organ failure, rheumatoid arthritis or asthma, whereas others fail to do so.

The inflammatory reaction is characterised by the stimulation of humoural and cellular medi-ator systems and the release of a great variety of inflammatory mediators which result in alterations in microvascular tone and permeability. The products of the classical cascade systems and various other mediators are capable of activating the lipid mediator syntheses which are essentially involved in the regulation of the complex inflammatory reaction. [1] Prostaglandins such as prostaglandin (PG) E 2 and PGI 2 (prostacyclin) induce oedema formation (tumour) and vasodilation (rubor), and contribute to the development of hyperalgesia at the site of inflammation (dolor). Fatty acid peroxides and leukotrienes additionally increase local permeability and are potent chemoattractants for neutrophil granulocytes, resulting in a further accumulation of phagocytes in the microcirculation. The inflammatory activity is further maintained by platelet activating factor (PAF), which is another important lipid mediator stimulating neutrophils and partially influencing the vascular tone and permeability. Moreover, PAF is a chemotactic agent, which con-tributes to leucocyte-mediated injury in inflammatory processes. The aim of this article is to give a brief update of the pathophysiological impact of lipid mediators in inflammatory disorders and to summarise the recent development of therapeutic approaches.",

In individuals without relevant dietary intake of \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-3-PUFAs, contained in fish oils), AA is predominantly released from the phospholipid pool of cellular membranes, which is metabolised by 2 major pathways to pro-inflammatory mediators [2] (fig. 1 ). The vaso-and bronchoconstrictive metabolites thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ) and PGF 2\u03b1 are produced via the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. The TXA 2 -induced vaso-and bronchospasm predominates over the relaxing effects of simultaneously generated PGI 2 and PGE 2 on smooth muscle cells of vessels and bronchioli. The pattern of eicosanoids formed depends on the enzyme content of the particular cells [3] (fig. 2) .",

In the case of increased membrane lipid content of \u03c9-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) competes with AA for metabolism via the COX and lipoxygenase pathways. [5] The EPA-derived metabolites have lower biological activity [6] than the analogous AA derivatives. In comparison with the AA-derived TXA 2 , the EPA-derived COX-product of the 3-series TXA 3 has considerably reduced proaggregatory and vasoconstrictive properties, while PGI 3 possesses similar antiaggregatory and vasodilative effects to those of PGI 2 . Enzymatic conversion of EPA generates the 5series leukotrienes (LTB 5 , C 5 , D 5 , E 5 ) which have partially antagonistic biological effects compared with AA derivatives. [7] The vasoconstrictive and chemotactic potency of LTB 5 is 2 orders of magnitude lower than the activity of LTB 4 . [8] In addition, the generation of proinflammatory PAF is reduced by EPA via interference with the PAF precursor pool.

Inhibition of this enzyme could result in the suppression of 3 important classes of inflammatory lipids (PGs, LTs and PAF), which offers an attractive therapeutic approach to the design of novel agents for the treatment of inflammation and tissue injury. The PLA 2 family is a series of enzymes involved in phospholipid catabolism. More than 150 PLA 2 amino acid sequences are currently available in protein sequence databases. PLA 2 exists in both extracellular and intracellular forms. Secretory PLA 2 (sPLA 2 ) are Ca ++dependent enzymes (molecular weight 14 kD, regulated by millimolar amounts of Ca ++ ) which are classified in 2 groups on the basis of their primary structures. [10] Secretory nonpancreatic PLA 2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of articular inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, whereas pancreatic PLA 2 contributes to the tissue damage associated with acute pancreatitis. The cytosolic PLA 2 (cPLA 2 ) is an 85.2 kD enzyme with substrate specificity for AA. It is found in most cells and tissues and is regulated by Ca ++ in the micromolar range. [11] cPLA 2 plays an important role in both the rapid and the prolonged cellular responses occurring during inflammatory processes.",

Anti-inflammatory effects of PAF antagonists on experimental models of arthritis have been published [19] indicating the modulation of different proinflammatory cytokines. Data obtained in a model of immune complex arthritis demonstrated controversial regulatory effects of the PAF antagonist bepafant (WEB-2170) on eicosanoid release.

It has been suggested that NSAID toxicity is due to inhibition of COX-1, whereas therapeutic properties derive from COX-2 inhibition at the site of inflammation. [28, 29] Therefore, selective COX-2 inhibitors such as SC-58125 may exert anti-inflammatory effects without gastrointestinal toxicity [30] (table III) . Recent clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in the therapy of arthritis, pointing towards sufficient symptom relief with an improved gastrointestinal tolerability. [31] Moreover, evidence has accumulated that COX-2 inhibition could suppress the growth of colorectal cancer. [32] Studies investigating the effect of COX inhibitors in septic conditions demonstrated that ibuprofen was able to attenuate most of the adverse consequences of endotoxin administration and to prolong survival in an animal model. [33] Bernhard et al. [34] recently reported reduced levels of PGI 2 and thromboxane in septic patients after administration of ibuprofen. Fever, tachycardia, oxygen consumption and lactic acidosis were blunted, whereas the development of shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality rate were unaltered. [34] While ibuprofen not only inhibits inflammatory COX products such as thromboxane but also the vasodilator PGI 2 , another interesting approach is the inhalational application of PGI 2 in the therapy of acute respiratory distress to improve the ventilation-perfusion ratio (V/Q) in the lung. [35] Aerosolised PGI 2 selectively induces pulmonary vasodilation and redistribution of blood flow from shunt areas to well ventilated regions, thereby increasing oxygenation in severe ARDS. [35] It appears that PGI 2 is a valuable tool in the therapy of V/Q mismatch. The beneficial and adverse effects of COX inhibition suggest the combination of systemic COX-2 inhibition and additional supplementation with aerosolised PGI 2 supplementation in acute lung failure, to control inflammation.",

[46] The beneficial effects of \u03c9-3-PUFAs seem to be related to the uptake of EPA into cellular membranes after dietary or parenteral application, and its subsequent metabolism. In states of inflammation, EPA is released to compete with AA for metabolism at the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase levels ( fig. 1 ). The metabolites of EPA (pentaene-LTs, triene-PGs and TXA 3 ) have less proinflammatory and chemotactic potency than the substances derived from AA (tetraene-LTs, diene-PGs and TXA 2 ). Considering the massive synthesis of lipid mediators during inflammatory reactions, supplementation of parenteral or enteral feeding with \u03c9-3 fatty acids seems to be a promising therapeutic approach in inflammatory disorders, acting by modulating the lipid mediator spectrum.",

            "text": "Lipid mediators are 'local mediators' which act in the intercellular microenvironments, where they reach considerable levels. They are released from various tissues and cells and usually develop their effects at the site of production because of their short half-life and rapid enzymatic inactivation. Numerous mediators stimulate the lipid mediator cascade generating pro-inflammatory eicosanoids which increase their own synthesis via positive feedback loops. As a consequence, cascade systems which are essential for host defence may become self-perpetuating and independent of the original stimuli, and finally cause tissue damage. Research efforts of the past few decades have resulted in the development of therapeutic interventions at different sites of the inflammatory reaction. To date, a broad spectrum of different enzyme inhibitors and receptor antagonists has been investigated, showing a variety of effects on the course of diseases. Animal studies and in vitro investigations have revealed important beneficial anti-inflamma-tory and immune modulating properties of lipid mediator antagonism.",
