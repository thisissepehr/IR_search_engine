In a study by Zhi et al; they emphasised the need to educate the staff of faith-based organisations especially in exercises and drills. 7 Eventually, Clawson et al examined the community health centres' preparedness in the case of bioterrorism. They demonstrated that less than half of the centres possessed bioterrorism preparedness in their plan and only one-third among them included bioterrorism preparedness in their written policies. 8 Frequent religious mass gatherings and food serving in customs gathering exposure Iran in the various potentiality of outbreaks and bioterrorism. [9] [10] [11] Besides, limited access to resources in epidemic seasons in developing countries like Iran would worsen the situation. 12 Although Iran has an extensive community-based primary healthcare (PHC) network that raise community awareness of local risk profiles and aid community, a population-based study revealed that overall community awareness and preparedness for even routine disasters is low. [13] [14] [15] Iran's PHC network has taken some advocacy and training programmes focusing on community partnership. 13 14 CBOs can equip public health officials with information about vulnerable groups and how to meet their particular needs. 16 However, Iran still lacks an assessment tool evaluating the preparedness of CBOs in biohazards.",

In quantitative content validity, based on the CVR and CVI indicators, 21 items in the planning field, 10 items in the field of training and 24 items in the infrastructure field were Open access deleted. Finally, 54 items remained for entry into the construct validity stage. eFA and CFA About 105 CBHOs volunteered to participate in the study. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test for sampling adequacy was 0.773. Next, to determine if the correlation matrix had a significant difference with zero and factor analysis was justifiable or not, the Bartlett test of sphericity was performed, which turned out to be 4293 \u03c7 2 and p<0.001. These values indicated that the factor analysis is justifiable based on the correlation matrix, and the items can be used for factor analysis. In this study, limiting the extracting factors by referring to the 'community preparedness' principle of the CDC guideline in the field of public health emergencies 27 and applying varimax rotation, EFA with three factors were performed.",

Austin et al 26 showed that CBOs' preparedness in earthquake needs seven clusters of assessment including internal training, external response, response capabilities, information collection and distribution to staff, preparation, building protection and supplies. Moreover, Baezconde et al assessed preparedness of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) considering social and structural needs. Socially, NGOs have high 'social will' but little 'community readiness' to participate in emergencies. Structurally, NGOs' linkage to voluntary organisations and public health departments lack enough coordination. 41 An assessment tool with biohazard approach for CBO' preparedness is rare in literature, and we have tried to fill this gap.",

Moreover, biological hazard is a threatening disaster in Iran owing to the various cultural and religious mass gathering posing a high risk of occurrence, namely, the epidemic of influenza, hepatitis B and D, various types of haemorrhagic fevers and brucellosis. In response to these epidemics, Iran has used many strategies to cope with them. These include recruiting a surveillance system with mandatory reports of particular disease according to the guidelines of the ministry of health, training health personnel to prevent transmission of the disease in the community especially the high-risk group, using mass media to persuade community involvement in preventing transmission, controlling the vectors by using pesticides, educating people with high-risk job due to exposure to the disease source, preventing high-risk people in participating in Hajj (pilgrimage), mandatory vaccination if participating in certain religious occasions and educating hygiene habits like washing hands and using a mask in very crowded places. CBHOs participate in these actives to serve their covered population.
