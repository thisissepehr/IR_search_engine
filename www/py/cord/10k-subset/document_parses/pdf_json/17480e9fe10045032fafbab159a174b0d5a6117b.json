Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy.
