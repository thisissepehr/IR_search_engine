            "text": "It is a vast understatement to say that the problem of access to medicines in developing countries is complex. Access is limited by a range of factors including inability to pay, a lack of infrastructure, and corruption in some countries. Surrounding and exacerbating these structural and technological problems is the layer of legal rights created by patents and their licensing that complicate and render more expensive the preparation and delivery of needed medicines, particularly those that need to be adapted to the social, health and cultural environment of developing countries. This article provides a survey of innovative strategies that aim at maximizing the potential of patents to facilitate the development and delivery of medicines against diseases, the burden of which falls principally on developing country populations. To understand the context in which these strategies are being proposed and implemented, the article reviews the battles over access to medicines beginning in the late 1980s. It then surveys some of the principal suggestions put forward to better direct innovation systems in addressing the critical health needs of the world's majority including advance market commitments, patent buy-outs, prize funds, public-private partnerships and patent pools.",

What is worse, for every two people for whom treatment is provided, five are infected (UNAIDS, 2010b) . The difficulties in providing greater access to treatment are multiple and intertwined.

Instead of concentrating on strategies that are best designed specifically to ease problems over delivery and compliance -for example, single pills incorporating combinations of drugs that ease compliance, heat-insensitive formulations that can be transported at lower cost, or pediatric formulations that address the very specific needs of children -discussions too often end in finger pointing over solutions that do not, in the end, address in form and quantity the full extent of the problem. One example of this is the continued and long discussions over the implementation of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) rules that allow for the issue of a compulsory license to export drugs (Morin and Gold, 2010) . While these rules are admittedly largely unworkable, at least as implemented in developed countries, fixing them will likely have limited benefit as there are few natural trade relations with respect to generic medicines between developing and developed nations .",

The US then pressured developing countries to increase their patent protection by relying on the threat of trade sanctions and the promise of privileged trade access.

Combined with the HIV \u2044 AIDS crisis, this lawsuit was a catalyst for the emergence of what became the access to medicines campaign. NGOs portrayed the South African case as a battle between greedy and powerful transnational corporations defending excessive profit margins and a weak state defending human life. Even when pharmaceutical companies dropped the case and the US relaxed its diplomatic pressure, developing countries were able to take advantage of the momentum created by NGOs. At the 2001 WTO conference, they successfully obtained the Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health which called for international negotiations to address the need of certain countries to import generic medicines. In 2003, a WTO decision defined the conditions under which a country could export generic pharmaceutical products to another and, in 2005, the decision was translated into a permanent amendment to the TRIPs agreement.",

These proposals recognize that those suffering from HIV \u2044 AIDS and other tropical and neglected diseases in developing countries do not have sufficient wealth to pay high prices for medicines. This means that their market pull, as opposed to that of those with high incomes, is limited.

The idea of AMCs is simple: providing the private sector with financial incentives to develop a new medicine or vaccine for low-and medium-income countries equal to that of an ordinary high-income world medicine or, better yet, a blockbuster medicine. The key here is to mimic the expected economic returns for the blockbuster as viewed at the time the investment decision is made, not at the time of sale. Rather than relying on an estimate of the price per dose that the market would provide, an AMC works by fixing an artificial price per dose based on a promise to pay by a country, a foundation, an intergovernmental fund or a combination of these. Those making the promise would establish criteria that the medication or vaccine would need to meet, a guaranteed per dose price and a pool consisting of a fixed amount of money that would be used to pay that price. Based on this promise, a producer would create and manufacture a medicine or vaccine meeting the criteria and sell it in one of the designated developing countries. That country would pay a small amount per dose (a 'co-payment') while the AMC sponsors would top up that amount to the guaranteed per dose price until the pool funds are exhausted. After that point, the producer would agree, in advance, to sell the medicine at a fixed price (that is less than the guaranteed price) or allow generic competition.",

Participating companies agree to sell vaccines for no more than $3.50 a dose during a ten-year period. These firms will receive an additional $3.50 per dose for up to 20 per cent of those doses.

Instead, it fits within the existing market logic, making it very palatable to industry. It is this very logic, however, that raises the most significant concern with AMCs. At a time when the pharmaceutical industry is questioning its own business model (Gold et al., 2008; Munos, 2009 Munos, , 2010 , the AMC can be viewed as an incentive to maintain the status quo.

Perhaps of even greater concern is that, knowing that their patents may be bought out, firms may begin patenting knowledge that they otherwise would have left in the public domain or may secure a larger number of patents than necessary in order to inflate prices. As patents are well known to give rise to strategic behavior (Harhoff et al., 2008) , this could very well limit the use of patent buy-outs to situations in which a patent already exists (as opposed to offering buy-outs prospectively) where there are clear controls against collusion, overpatenting and other market distortions. While this would increase the availability of existing medicines over the next decade, it would not provide a long-term solution.",

Other pools have most recently been created to serve public, rather than commercial, interests. This social-entrepreneurial approach is evident in the attempt to create a SARS patent pool which brought together public research agencies, a government department and industry to facilitate the development of a SARS virus vaccine (Gold, 2003) . As Levy et al. (2010) demonstrate, the idea of the SARS pool came about in 2003 because the four public institutions involved wished to clear fragmentation in addressing what was then perceived as a critical health need. With support from the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health, the parties began the long process of creating the SARS pool. While, today, the pool remains at the letter of intent stage -in large part because SARS has not reappeared and because the patents took so long to issue -it provides a clear starting point for efforts to promote innovation through collaboration (Levy et al., 2010) .",

While the SARS patent pool was moving in this direction, the Medicines Patent Pool will likely be the first to attempt to convince pharmaceutical companies to participate in it. Indeed, to have a realistic chance of success, this, as well as other pools, will need to rely largely on voluntary licenses from patent holders. If a pool is unable to gather all the required licenses using a voluntary approach, pool administrators will need to consider whether to seek compulsory licenses over remaining patents. But a pool based solely or even predominantly on compulsory licenses would be unworkable, as it would have no leverage to coordinate license terms, supervise production or reduce the costs of negotiation (Gold et al., 2007) .",

However, the Medicines Patent Pool has so far failed to obtain most of the needed industrial licenses although it has gained licenses from the US National Institutes of Health. Unlike the latter licenses, the agreement between the Medicines Patent Pool and Gilead Sciences, announced in July 2011, does not establish a pool but a brokerage arrangement. Under this agreement, Gilead imposes its own licensing terms, including the requirement that generic manufacturers wait for Gilead to obtain US Food and Drug Administration approval, the direct payment of license fees to Gilead and the non-reciprocal obligation of generic manufacturers to share improvements with Gilead. While likely to increase access, the arrangement with Gilead, if followed by other pharmaceutical companies, does not lead to the efficiencies and benefits promised by a patent pool.",

There is fundamental disagreement between these actors on the importance and value of patents and the role of generic companies and public sector institutions involved in research and development.
