Thus a variety of BDV variants have been used, including strains that cause paralysis and death (similar to the disease in horses and sheep), obesity with fertility disturbances, behavioral changes, or inapparent infections. In all cases, ic inoculation of BDV into adult rats resulted in productive viral replication in the nervous system, where viral antigen was confined to astrocytes, Schwann cells, and central and ganglionic neurons and their axonal-dendritic processes [10, 41, 42] . Infectivity was first detected in brain homogenates 7 days after inoculation with 105-106 ID50/mL by day 15 [26] . This infectivity titer in the brain was maintained throughout an observation period of 7 months (figure 3, top). Similar data were obtained for Black Hooded rats, which were found to be resistant to the disease [35] . Lower levels of infectivity (10 2-104 ID50/mL) were usually found in spinal cord, adrenal glands, and ganglia of the autonomic nervous system. Infectivity in the eyes was transient, lasting -4 weeks after virus appeared in the brain. Loss of infectivity coincided later with degeneration and loss of retinal neurons. In immunocompetent adult rats no infectivity was found in extraneural tissue at any stage [26, 43] . Neither infectious virus nor viral antigens were detectable in lung, spleen, kidney, muscle, peritoneal macrophages, or blood.

The inoculated rabbits developed no signs of Borna disease; neither lesions in the CNS nor BDV-specific antigens were demonstrable in brain sections by immunohistologic techniques. Nevertheless, these animals developed BDV-specific antibodies in their sera. That the brain homogenate from one rabbit was infectious for fetal rabbit brain cells was demonstrated by positive cell foci in immunofluorescence assays [20] . However, again, the antigen disappeared during attempts to propagate the agent by subcultivation of the cells.
