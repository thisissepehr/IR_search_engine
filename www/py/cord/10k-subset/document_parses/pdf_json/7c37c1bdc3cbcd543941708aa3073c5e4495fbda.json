Approximately 2% of human genes encode proteases or their homologs, and proteases are involved in various biological processes, such as development, immunity, blood clotting, and wound healing [1, 2] . Therefore, aberrant protease activity is associated with various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, inflammatory disease, and virus-related diseases [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . To treat diseases resulting from hyperactivity of proteases, small molecule inhibitors have been developed. Inhibitors against matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and cathepsin, which play an important role in cancer metastasis, have been actively investigated [4, 8, 9] . Protease inhibitors against the HIV protease are one of the most successful approaches to controlling the disease [7] . On the other hand, in diseases that are characterized by low or no protease activity, recombinant proteases are introduced into humans; for example, Factor IX for hemophilia B and tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) for breakdown of blood clots [10] . Because of this relevance of proteases to disease states, the activity of specific proteases is an important indicator in the diagnosis of many diseases. For example, serine protease kallikrein 3, also known as prostate specific antigen, is a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer [11] . Cathepsin, urokinase, and MMPs are also known as markers of cancers [4, 8, 12, 13] .

Two types of systems have been developed. In the first system (Fig. 1A) , the donor is a fluorophore, and the acceptor is a quencher. The emission spectrum of the donor overlaps with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor, and the quencher reduces the intensity of fluorescence from the fluorophore. Upon hydrolysis of the peptide substrate by protease, the donor and the acceptor move apart, and the emission of light from the fluorophore is restored. In the second configuration, a second fluorophore instead of the quencher can be linked to the donor fluorophore, (Fig. 1B) , and the acceptor absorbs light from the donor and emits light of a different wavelength.

In order to overcome these drawbacks, the luciferase enzyme has been investigated as a source for photon emission, in a process referred to as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) [17] .

Even though FRETbased protease assay methods have significantly improved with advancements in technologies for synthesizing fluorescent molecules and for light-detection instruments, there is still a need to develop new assay methods with higher sensitivity, while maintaining at least the same level of noise. One strategy for improving the assay sensitivity is to take advantage of a signal amplification processes via enzyme cascades ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ). In these methods, a protease of interest activates another enzyme by removing the restrictions on the enzyme via a cleavage event, and the activated enzyme then generates detectable signals. These methods include signal amplification steps by reporter enzymes, and the degree of amplification is dependent on the catalytic activity of the activated enzymes. In the remaining part of this review, we will summarize recent research focused on developing methods of measuring protease activity utilizing the enzyme cascades.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 710, "end": 716, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 721, "end": 728, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Amplification of Protease Activity Signal through Enzyme Cascades"}, {"text": "3.1. Pro-protease protease sensors A recent report described an assay method for enteropeptidase, which employs a naturally occurring enzyme- Fig. 2 . Signal amplification strategy using enzyme cascades. A protease activates a zymogen into an active one, which then generates a detectable signal. The activated enzyme can convert more than one substrate; thus, the protease activity signal is amplified, and the readout signal is theoretically higher than that generated directly by the protease activity, such as the signal generated in Fig. 1 . Autoinhibited split luciferase Luciferin Luminescence TEV Caspases [40, 41] Autoinhibited split lactamase Fluorocillin Fluorescence TEV [40] Phospholipase A 2 NBD C 6 -HPC Fluorescence SUMO protease [34] cascade reaction. Enteropeptidase is a serine protease and converts trypsinogen into active trypsin by cleaving the Nterminal peptide (DDDDK) of the zymogen [27] . In this assay, trypsinogen serves as the substrate for enteropeptidase, and the activated trypsin generated by the action of enteropeptidase cleaves a FRET peptide substrate. The signal generated by enteropeptidase is amplified by the catalytic activity of trypsin. To develop the assay method, the authors first optimized FRET peptide substrates of trypsin based on the FRET efficiency and its cleavage efficiency/specificity, and further tested a range of enteropeptidase concentrations, using the optimized substrates and trypsinogen. The limit of detection (LOD) was around 200 fM enteropeptidase in a complex biological mixture of Escherichia coli lysate, as well as in a buffered solution. This is probably the lowest LOD reported for any enteropeptidase assay, and the improved sensitivity is probably attributable to the signal amplification by the enzymatic cascade. An enteropeptidase assay is, perhaps, of limited clinical significance. However, the authors mentioned that the system can be adapted for the detection of any other protease. To apply this strategy for other proteases, the Nterminal sequence of trypsinogen should be engineered in such that the protease of interest cleaves the modified sites; while the engineered trypsinogen remains inactive. One, and seemingly the only, approach is to insert a peptide sequence that the protease of interest recognizes and cleaves between the N-terminal peptide and trypsin. However, small changes in protein sequences can alter the function/structure of proteins, and additional studies, especially using proteases that are disease markers, are necessary to generalize the strategy employed in this study. Verheijen et al. took a similar approach to develop an assay method for MMPs, which are known to be involved in cancer metastasis [28] . Pro-urokinase (pro-uPA) is activated to urokinase (uPA) through proteolytic cleavage by plasmin, and the activity of uPA can be detected by using a chromogenic substrate (pyro-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide). To engineer a form of pro-uPA that can be activated by MMPs instead of by plasmin, the authors replaced the sequence of amino acids in pro-uPA that is recognized by plasmin (PRFL \u2193 IIGG, where the arrow indicates the cleavage site) with one that can be hydrolyzed by many MMPs (RPLG \u2193 IIGG). Using this system, the authors observed an increased MMP activity in synovial tissue extracts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, compared to the activity of extracts from patients with osteorarthritis. The samples tested in this study might not have detectable uPA activity, enabling detection of increased activity. However, blood and urine, which are most widely used for disease diagnosis, have significant activity of the reporter enzyme, uPA, which definitely imposes a limitation on the clinical application of this assay method.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 614, "end": 618, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 619, "end": 622, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 683, "end": 687, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 746, "end": 750, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 908, "end": 912, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2715, "end": 2719, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 148, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 538, "end": 544, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Amplification of Protease Activity Signal through Enzyme Cascades"}, {"text": "Firefly luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of firefly luciferin in the presence of Mg\u00b7ATP and oxygen into oxyluciferin, which emits a yellow-green light upon relaxation.

In an attempt to exploit the beneficial properties of luciferase, Fan et al. engineered luciferase asprotease sensors [29] . Firefly luciferase has 2 domains, a large N-terminal domain and a small Cterminal domain; both domains are connected through a hinge-like linker. The C-terminal domain rotates and translocates to the N-terminal domain upon substrate binding (Fig. 3A) . Based on these structural features, the authors engineered a circularly permuted construct: the N-and C-termini were connected through a linker that included sequence cleavable by a protease, and new C-and N-termini were created at the 233 and 234 positions, respectively (Fig. 3B) . The linker restricts the conformational change induced by substrate binding, and the circularly permuted luciferase exhibits very little luminescence, several 1,000-fold lower than the wild-type enzyme.

The fusion of the ER domain silences the activity of the reporter, and cleavage of the linkers by caspase-3 restores the luciferase activity.

A protein is split into two fragments, and each fragment is fused to proteins of interest. When the two proteins interact with each other directly, or via another molecule, the split fragments are assembled into an active protein. Autoinhibition is a naturally occurring mechanism for regulating protein activity: the protein has a polypeptide pseudosubstrate that blocks access to its active site, and the inhibitory region can be displaced through a conformational change or removed by a cleavage [38, 39] . Shekhawat et al. employed these two mechanisms for regulation of protein activity, split protein complementation, and autoinhibition, to engineer protein reporters that can be activated by the action of protease (Fig. 3D ) [40] . They used previously developed split protein complement systems: firefly luciferase and \u03b2-lactamase. One half of the reporter is linked to an antiparallel heterodimeric coiled coil (A-B), in which the A-B) is autoinhibited, and complementation of the two split fragments is thus prevented [40] . two coils are linked through a protease-cleavable linker, and the other half is linked to a coil (B'), which can dimerize with A. The heterodimeric coiled coil (A-B), which is autoinhibited, has a very low binding affinity to B', and the complementation of the 2 fragments is, therefore, unlikely. However, when a protease cleaves the linker connecting A and B, the interaction between A and B' can occur, and the split halves then assemble into an active reporter, such as luciferase or \u03b2-lactamase. Using these systems, the authors developed and optimized protease sensors for the TEV protease and caspase-3.

Kim and Chung exploited the advantages of CPT to amplify the signal of a protease activity assay. This strategy differed from the ones that use the enzyme cascades that have been described so far, but the signal amplification method is worth introducing in this review [43] . The system used in this study included two kinds of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), GNPa, in which the GNP is conjugated to a peptide-DNA complex, and GNPb, in which the GNP is conjugated to a RNA-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) complex. GNPb particles were also pegylated to minimize heteroduplex formation between the GNPa DNA and GNPb RNA. Thus, RNase H was prevented from cleaving the single-stranded RNA of GNPb, and the fluorescence of FITC was quenched by GNPs. When a protease of interest cleaves the peptide sequence linking the DNA and GNPa, the DNA oligomers are released from the nanoparticles and diffuse, eventually forming DNA/RNA duplexes with the RNA in GNPb. Duplex formation allows RNase H to hydrolyze the RNA linked to GNPb, and the quenched fluorescence of FITC is thus recovered. DNA oligomers, which are a product of the protease activity, are not consumed by the RNase H reaction, the cycle of duplex formation and RNA hydrolysis can be continued, serving as the signal amplification step. The authors applied this system to the MMP2 protease, and the sensitivity of the protease was improved, to the detection of MMP2 at levels as low as 10 pM.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 209, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 481, "end": 485, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Signal amplification via cycling probe technology"}, {"text": "Proteases play important roles in diverse biological processes and are important markers of a number of diseases. Various methods have been developed to analyze their activities, and the protease assay methods based on RET are, currently, the most common approaches. However, new tools with relatively higher sensitivity and at least the same level of noise, if not a further reduction in noise, are still needed. One solution to resolve this problem are the approaches that rely on amplifying the signal of protease activity by using enzyme cascades, and several specific strategies have been attempted so far. Improved sensitivity has been demonstrated for these methods, but the optimization of these methods or development of new ones is required for application to diverse purposes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Protease proteomics: Revealing protease in vivo functions using systems biology approaches", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Doucet", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Overall", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Mol.
