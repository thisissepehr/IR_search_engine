Seeds were exposed to three storage treatments: relatively constant laboratory conditions, an oven with fluctuating temperatures similar to those found on the soil surface (25/60\u00b0C), or exposed on the soil surface at Townsville. There were wide ranges of initial levels of dormancy (9-100%), rates of change of dormancy and response to the different storage conditions showing that species with several types of dormancy characteristics are able to coexist in these communities. The general trend in dormancy levels was a decline with time with the rate of decline greatest for seeds exposed on the soil surface and least for those stored in the laboratory. The species were divided into groups based on dormancy levels in seeds on the soil surface during the late dry and mid wet seasons. The dormancy characteristics of the groups were related to the ecology of the species in the groups. There was an approximately linear increase in germination rate (i.e. a decrease in the number of days to 50% of final germination) over time for all storage treatments; rates for seeds on the soil surface increased more rapidly than those of seeds in laboratory and oven samples.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The optimum time for seed germination in strongly seasonal climates is as early in the growing season as possible to gain resources for growth and reproduction but not so early that survival is unlikely (Rathcke & Lacey 1985) .

In these environments, species need to avoid germination on small falls of rain during the dry season as mortality can be complete during subsequent dry periods (McKeon 1985; McKeon et al. 1985) . Seeds then need to germinate early in the wet season as later-establishing seedlings are less likely to survive competition from established perennial plants and older seedlings (Ross & Harper 1972; Cook & Ratcliff 1984 , 1985 . Surface soil temperatures frequently exceed 50\u00b0C during the dry season in tropical areas (Mott 1978; Mott et al. 1981; McKeon et al. 1985) and exposure to such high temperatures is an important dormancy-breaking mechanism in some tropical grasses and Stylosanthes species (Mott 1978; Mott et al. 1981; Hacker 1984; Hacker et al. 1984; Hacker & Ratcliff 1989) . Herbaceous communities can contain many more species than those assessed already, so this study was undertaken to compare the changes in dormancy and germination of seed of a wide range of native and exotic species (based on Henderson 1997) collected at two sites typical of the seasonally dry tropics. The seed was stored under relatively constant laboratory conditions (control), exposed on the soil surface to simulate field conditions, or kept in an oven with fluctuating temperatures similar to those found on the soil surface (25/60\u00b0C). The oven treatment approximates the temperature environment experienced by seed in the field (Mott 1978; McKeon et al. 1985) but excludes other effects such as wetting/drying and fungal infections. Seed size has been related to seed germination and persistence and has been used to predict seed longevity (e.g. Grime 1989 ; Thompson et al. 1993; Bekker et al. 1998) . Germination rate may control germination in tropical areas so relationships between seed weight and germination rate were also examined to assess the utility of seed size as a predictor.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 78, "end": 102, "text": "(Torssell & McKeon 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 103, "end": 112, "text": "Mott 1978", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 113, "end": 124, "text": "Mott , 1980", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 125, "end": 139, "text": "Marks 1983a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 140, "end": 163, "text": "McIvor & Gardener 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 327, "end": 340, "text": "(McKeon 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 341, "end": 360, "text": "McKeon et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 541, "end": 561, "text": "(Ross & Harper 1972;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 562, "end": 582, "text": "Cook & Ratcliff 1984", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 583, "end": 589, "text": ", 1985", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 681, "end": 692, "text": "(Mott 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 693, "end": 710, "text": "Mott et al. 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 711, "end": 730, "text": "McKeon et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 864, "end": 875, "text": "(Mott 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 876, "end": 893, "text": "Mott et al. 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 894, "end": 906, "text": "Hacker 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 907, "end": 926, "text": "Hacker et al. 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 927, "end": 950, "text": "Hacker & Ratcliff 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1600, "text": "(Mott 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1620, "text": "McKeon et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1817, "text": "Grime 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1841, "text": "Thompson et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1861, "text": "Bekker et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Austral Ecology (2000) 25, [213] [214] [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] [222] Dormancy and germination characteristics of herbaceous species in the seasonally dry tropics of northern Australia", "cite_spans": [{"start": 8, "end": 22, "text": "Ecology (2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 27, "end": 32, "text": "[213]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 33, "end": 38, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 39, "end": 44, "text": "[215]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 45, "end": 50, "text": "[216]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 51, "end": 56, "text": "[217]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 57, "end": 62, "text": "[218]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 63, "end": 68, "text": "[219]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 69, "end": 74, "text": "[220]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 75, "end": 80, "text": "[221]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 81, "end": 86, "text": "[222]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Fully mature dispersal units (hereafter referred to as seeds) of 21 species were collected in April-May 1983 from pastures in either the Townsville-Woodstock (indicated by W after the species name) area of north Queensland or from Katherine (K) in the Northern Territory (Table 1) .

From this study, the most useful treatments will be those where the storage conditions are as similar as possible to the conditions actually experienced by seeds in the field, for example the soil storage treatment in this experiment. Second, there are a range of dormancy responses in species from these communities. This is true even within a plant type, for example all four dormancy groups were represented in the annual grasses. The major native perennial grasses had very low to low levels of dormancy after exposure on the soil surface during the dry and wet seasons but a number of weedy annual grasses and dicots (except Hyptis suaveolens) had medium to high dormancy levels at the end of the dry season which were maintained to different degrees during the following wet season.
