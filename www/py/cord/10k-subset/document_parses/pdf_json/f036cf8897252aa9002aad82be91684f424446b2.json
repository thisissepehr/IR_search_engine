Industry's research and development pipeline has produced drugs that have saved AIDS victims previously facing certain death, but still no cure nor vaccine is yet available. Experience with the process of research and development indicates that it requires more than a decade of development to produce a new drug with costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Intellectual property protection is critically important in assuring that drug development continues. Partnerships between industry and the public sector have increased access to new therapies in developing countries and promise to enhance access to both patented and generic medicines in the future.",

In some African countries, AIDS prevalence reaches 40 percent of the adult population, 10 and it is associated with an important decrease in life expectancy, estimated at seven years between 1980 and 2002. 11 Other emerging diseases include SARS, hepatitis C, or influenza A virus -all identified in the 1990s for the first time. 12 Among the re-emerging infectious diseases, tuberculosis is the greatest contributor to human mortality. Almost eradicated from much of the world in the 1940s, and now returning at alarming rates in new, more virulent forms, tuberculosis causes 1.5 million deaths annually and it is estimated that nearly a third of the world's population has been latently infected with the mycobacterium. 13 Other such re-emerging diseases include cholera, dengue fever, malaria or meningococcal meningitis -all reappearing as important public health problems.",

Thanks to more than 20 antiretroviral medicines discovered and developed entirely by research and development within pharmaceutical companies, 21 death rates from AIDS have plunged by 80 per cent in the US and Europe. 22 The case of HIV/AIDS is illustrative of the process of pharmaceutical innovation. Despite significant progress already achieved in terms of treating AIDS patients, further intensive R&D efforts are needed to develop effective preventive (vaccines) and curative tools, which are considered as the only viable solution to stop the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The pharmaceutical industry continues its effort, and there are currently more than 80 drugs and vaccines in development for HIV/AIDS and its various opportunistic infections. 23 The pharmaceutical industry, often working in partnership with public health research institutions, academia and small biotech companies, has been the principal source of new medicines currently in use. Only 4 of the 47 'global' medicines with annual sales in excess of $500 million have been developed with any funding support from public research institutions, and such support has been provided at a very early stage. 24 The pharmaceutical companies invested almost $50 billion in R&D in 2002, outscoring the US National Health Institutes-the world's biggest public health research institution-by 50 percent. 25, 26 R&D efforts of the pharmaceutical industry spread over a broad range of diseases and thus attempt to address all major public health needs. Figure 1 illustrates these endeavours, showing the number of drug and vaccine candidates currently in the industry's development pipeline. Altogether, there are more than 1,200 new drug and vaccine candidates in clinical development, and the total number of medicines in research and development, i.e. including drug/vaccine candidates in early discovery and preclinical development, was the highest ever, reaching more than 7,300 drug and vaccine candidates. 27 The social and economic value of medicines innovation generated by the pharmaceutical industry is difficult to overstate. Health-related technology improvements led by the introduction of new medicines are estimated to have reduced human mortality by upwards of 50 percent between 1960 and 1990. 28 Various studies provide evidence of a clear link between innovative medicines and disease prevalence, 29 mortality rates, 30 and overall economic growth. 31 Also, innovative medicines may be a source of important budgetary savings for health systems, reducing hospital stays, surgical interventions and other non-drug costs. 32, 33 A very good illustration of the value of medicines innovation is provided by vaccines, which have long been considered as one of the most cost-effective interventions in health. For example, the increased global immunisation coverage, reaching 80-90 percent of infants in the late 1990s, 34 had a significant impact on the infant mortality rate, which dropped by 50 percent in least developed countries over last 25 years. 35 The pharmaceutical industry has developed the bulk of existing vaccines 36 and among more than 70 vaccines currently in development pipeline, there may be future vaccines for HIV/AIDS, infant diarrhoea, malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia, dengue fever, influenza and many other communicable diseases of high risk.

            "text": "Patents for products last nominally for twenty years from the time of grant by national patent offices of all WTO members who have implemented the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). However, meeting the exacting technical regulatory requirements of the product licensing authorities now takes, on average, ten years from the point at which a patent is granted for an invention, which is the effective starting point for the product development process. It should be noted that, in practice, the period of market exclusivity due to patent protection is much shorter, as a result of therapeutic competition, i.e. the introduction of competing products in the same therapeutic class shortly after the launch of the breakthrough product. By way of example, major products launched in the late 1980s enjoyed market exclusivity of 4 to 6 years, while products launched a decade later could only benefit from 0.5 to 2 years of exclusivity. 44 Data exclusivity is another form of intellectual property protection independent of patent protection. Developing a patented discovery into an approved saleable product requires amassing large amounts of data over many years on pharmacology, toxicology, clinical trials, manufacturing processes and product quality etc. These data are submitted in confidence as a single dossier to the relevant technical regulatory approval body in national (or EU) jurisdictions to gain a license to sell the product by the innovator. Article 39(3) of the TRIPS Agreement obliges WTO Member States to ensure that this data package shall be maintained confidential or exclusive to the originator for a fixed period from the date at which it was submitted to the government authorities. 45, 46 Perhaps the most telling example of the importance of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals is the fact that between 2002 and 2007 the value of US patents that will expire on 35 drugs (based on current global sales) is more than $73 billion. 47",

Specificity of these countries, in terms of their health status and underlying socio-economic conditions, has largely influenced the global agenda 48 and has had an important impact on the pharmaceutical industry itself. 49, 50 Arguably, the most important aspect of this problem concerns the issue of access to needed medicines in developing countries, and the alleged barriers that might be created by pharmaceutical patents. In order to see things in the right perspective, it should be noted that patents are in force on only about 30-40 percent of the global prescription volume. 51 Also, it is important to retain the fact that the great majority of diseases affecting developing countries can be effectively treated with the off-patent medicines from the WHO's Essential Drug List. 52 Actually, out of more than 300 medicines on this list, only a handful of products are still protected by any patents. 53 At the same time, in most poor countries, only 30-50 percent of the population has access to these essential medicines.",

A new form of collaborative action-public private partnerships-has now become a distinctive feature of the global health landscape, 55 and the pharmaceutical industry has been a critical stakeholder in these endeavours. 56 The involvement of the pharmaceutical companies in health partnerships spreads over diverse activities, from providing free-of-charge or highly discounted medicines, through training and capacity building, to conducting R&D to diseases exclusively affecting developing countries.
