The development and commercialization of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines illustrate how licensing practices of public research organizations can contribute to high prices of the resulting product and affect accessibility to vulnerable populations. Efforts by the international community to improve access to medicines have recognised this issue and promote the public health-sensitive management of research conducted by public research organizations. This paper explores: how medical knowledge is exchanged between public and private actors; what role inventor scientists play in this process; and how they view the implementation of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies.",

We explored the strategies by which knowledge is exchanged across institutional boundaries, how these strategies are negotiated, and the views of scientists regarding public health-sensitive knowledge exchange. Results: We included 13 studies in the systematic review and conducted seven semi-structured interviews with high-ranking scientists. The main avenues of public-private medical knowledge exchange were publications, formal transfer of patented knowledge, problem-specific exchanges such as service agreements, informal exchanges and collaborative research. Scientists played a crucial role in these processes but appeared to be sceptical of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies, as these were believed to deter corporate interest in the development of new medicines and thus risk the translation of the scientists' research.",

Their scepticism towards implementing public health-sensitive knowledge management strategies appears to be based on a biased understanding of the costs and risks involved in drug development and a perceived lack of alternatives to private engagement. Scientists could be encouraged to exchange knowledge in a public health-sensitive manner through not-for-profit drug development mechanisms, education on industry engagement, and stronger institutional and legal backing.",

Of all scientifically novel medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1998 and 2007, one in five were developed by PROs [1] . Medicines submitted by PROs were also more likely to receive priority review, awarded by the FDA for medicines deemed to represent major advances of the medical practice. Almost half of all drug approvals submitted by PROs have received priority review, compared to one in five submissions from the private sectorindicating that research carried out at PROs has a higher public health impact [2] .",

The first vaccine candidates were based on further research conducted by groups at the University of Queensland, Rochester University, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Georgetown University with contributions from other PROs such as the DKFZ [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . These research groups then licensed their Intellectual Property (IP) to MedImmune, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Merck, Sharpe & Dohme (MSD) for further development and clinical testing for efficacy and safety. Except for the licenses acquired from the NCI, these were all exclusive licenses, allowing the licensee to exclude others from making, marketing or selling the patented material MedImmune and GSK later formed a vaccines alliance and shared their IP with each other. In 1997, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office initiated patent interference proceedings between research groups in Queensland, Rochester, the NCI and Georgetown. As part of the dispute settlement the non-exclusive licenses provided by the NIH were turned into co-exclusive licenses in 2007. Both MSD and GSK had already cross-licensed their IP to each other, guaranteeing themselves unhindered access to the HPV vaccine technology and securing their market positions [16] [17] [18] . In 2006 and 2007, the European Medicines Agency approved two prophylactic HPV vaccines: Gardasil\u00ae (MSD) and Cervarix\u00ae (GSK).",

However, in 2014, only 1.2% of females 10-20 years of age in Africa and 1,1% of the same population in Asia had been fully immunized, despite accounting for 70% of all HPV-related cancer cases [24] [25] [26] . As of June 2018, only seven African and two South-East Asian countries have implemented national immunization programs for HPV [27] , indicating that immunization coverage fails to meet global needs even 12 years after the first vaccines became available. The reluctance of country governments to include HPV in national immunization programs has been associated with the high price of the vaccines, especially for states in transition that do not qualify for support mechanisms such as GAVI [26, [28] [29] [30] . However, the production costs for HPV vaccines are estimated to be as low as 3 USD for affluent and 0.60 USD per dose for less affluent markets respectively [31] , and by 2014, HPV vaccine sales had already amounted to a total of USD 14.1 billion, recouping the investment made by the pharmaceutical companies fivefold [32] .",

While such formal transfer of intellectual property constitutes a relevant and easily targeted knowledge exchange mechanism, it is far from the only one [41, 42] . Bradley, Hayter and Link formulate a broader concept of technology transfer, which includes the traditional licensing pathway through the PRO's Technology Transfer Office (TTO) as well as informal transfer mechanisms such as collaborations and informal exchange of knowledge [43] . Exploring these less codified forms of communication and emphasizing the role of the originator scientist, Perkman et al. have proposed the concept of academic engagement, any \"knowledge related collaboration\" by scientists at PROs with private entities [44] . Both technology transfer and academic engagement are set within the broader framework of knowledge generation and diffusion, comprehensively and famously conceptualized in the Triple Helix. In this model, knowledge is exchanged across institutional boundaries through an overlay of formal and informal, explicit and implicit communications between the private, academic and government spheres [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . To encompass all avenues of communication, the term 'knowledge exchange' will be adopted for this paper.",

Often in contrast to these \"academic channels\" [66] , studies discussed the protection of IP through patents and the subsequent licensing of the protected technologies [65, 67, 74] . Two papers, in particular, explored the conflict between publishing and patenting knowledge [66, 67] . They concluded that peer-reviewed publications function as a signal to the academic community that research is scientifically valuable. Individual scientists, their institutions, as well as early-stage spin-off companies, tend to signal their academic legitimacy through publications. Patents, on the other hand, signal commercial value and are thus preferred by pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as spin-offs that are already commercially exploiting their technology. A more recent study, however, found that patents and commercial success also translate into academic prestige, indicating a shift towards a more positive view of industrial engagement among the academic community [68] . It was also reported that some PROs provide financial incentives to scientists engaging in patenting and commercialization [68] . The only study from the African continent described that in Tanzania, public sector scientists avoided filing patents because the patent enforcement mechanisms were perceived to be too weak to adequately protect the IP disclosed in the patent application [76] .",

Two studies independently identified four phases of network development [70, 71] , with other studies providing additional detail (see Table 1 ). These studies show that the knowledge exchange strategies used by networks vary with the network development stage. They often begin with informal, personal contacts initiated by scientists working at PROs, for example at conferences. Once a rapport is established, a formal framework is negotiated between the partners and with the involvement of the PRO's TTO. The further the network progresses, the more trust is established and contractual routines are relaxed. Informal transfer of implicit knowledge between the partners then becomes possible. During the more advanced stages of network development, patentable IP may be produced and transferred formally. Especially in the initiation of research networks, scientists were found to play a key role.",

One American participant stated that establishing a spin-off has become very common. Generally, scientists reported that a spinoff would be created to continue the development as long as possible until a favorable license or sale could be negotiated with a larger company.

Within the Triple Helix Model, such individuals are called \"entrepreneurial scientists\" [42] , researchers who generate scientific knowledge and simultaneously examine it for commercial opportunities. In the qualitative study, we found attitudes and strategies that most closely resembled the \"New School\" professor described by Owen-Smith and Powell (2001), engaging with industry to promote the practical application of innovation and ultimately public health [67] . Limitations of industry engagement included a focus on applied research as well as conflict of interest. Reflecting these issues, a 2010 study in France found that 33.3% of academics in pharmaceutical research confirmed that patenting opportunities influence their research agenda [80] .",

The not-forprofit drug development initiative DNDi has instead suggested that research and development costs range from USD 100-150 million per approved drug, accounting for attrition and risk of failure [84] . These costs cover the entire process from exploratory early discovery -the riskiest of all research stages-to the market. However, at the point where universities begin engaging with industry partners regarding the development of a medical product, they have often progressed beyond the risky, early research stages. In the HPV vaccine case, for example, vaccine candidates had already been developed, their efficacy in animal models had been tested, and production methods had been explored. In cases like these a substantial part of the costs of development have thus already been shouldered by the PROs and ultimately, the public.",

A not-for-profit drug development program with a scope beyond neglected tropical diseases, such as a global funding mechanism for global health research and development as proposed by the WHO, would offer scientists a chance to turn their research into products without the caveats of industry entanglement and promote access to the resulting medicines. Such measures may enable scientists to support the realization of universal health coverage and access to affordable medicines, key components of the Sustainable Development Goal on Health [22] . It would also help abate some of the side effects of the current drug development system, such as biases in clinical trials, lack of research into new antimicrobials and other unprofitable health issues, as well as increasing financial pressure on social health insurances [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] .

In other medical fields, universities are increasingly exploring the implementation of public health-sensitive licensing practices [99, 100] and a set of global health sample clauses extracted from successful agreements can be found on the website of the Association of University Technology Managers [101] . Our results indicate a number of ways in which the implementation of public healthsensitive knowledge exchange strategies could be promoted. First, the scepticism regarding the implementation of public health-sensitive transfer practices among PRO scientists appeared to be based on an incomplete, industry-friendly understanding of the commercialization process. This suggests that education and training on drug development and transfer strategies may enable scientists to be more self-determined and informed when engaging with biomedical and pharmaceutical enterprises. Medical curricula, in particular, should include unbiased education on drug development. Second, institutional policies, or national legislation, should mandate public health-sensitive knowledge exchange in publicly funded research. This study also suggests additional avenues for promoting access to medicines that may be worth exploring. For example, informal exchanges, mature spin-offs looking to sell to a larger firm, or paid positions on advisory boards may be leveraged to promote access to medicines. This could possibly be achieved through institutional or regional standards of conduct for spin-offs or informal communications. Moreover, legal capacity building at the level of PRO TTOs could further strengthen the position and self-determination of PROs and individual scientists when engaging with private partners, whose legal presence appears to be perceived as overwhelming. Lastly, projects such as the University Report Card that monitor universities' global health practices and evaluate stewardship of IP, could promote transparency and commitment to these issues [102] .",

There is also a risk of social desirability bias, which we aimed to minimize in the conduct of the interviews. The interviews were conducted in German and English, data thus had to be analysed across different languages and quotes had to be translated, possibly affecting the research results. In addition, most interview participants were male; the female perspective on the issues under study, therefore, remains underrepresented. We also chose to focus on the role of the inventor scientist and used a case study of successful commercialization. Building on our research, future studies should include TTO professionals and private actors; and include scientists with less experience in private engagement to triangulate different perspectives. Limitations of the systematic review include that the screening process could not be conducted in duplicate due to resource constraints. However, the screening strategy was piloted on a large portion of the studies in duplicate and all uncertainties regarding the decisions on the remaining studies were discussed within the research team to ensure the quality and rigor of this review.",
