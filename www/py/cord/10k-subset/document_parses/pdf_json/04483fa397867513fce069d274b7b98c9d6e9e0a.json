The authors retrospectively analysed data within the registry of the European Society of Intensive Care, and compared a mixture of patients with suspected, probable or confirmed H1N1 influenza A infection who received corticosteroids early, later or not at all. They conclude that the early use of steroids did not result in reduced morbidity or mortality and was associated with an increased risk of infection. We would like to comment on these conclusions.",

However, the authors did not describe any modelling for the other potential confounding variables of age, asthma, COPD and previous chronic use of steroids. These are all risk factors for carriage and overgrowth of abnormal flora, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and predispose to lower airway infection [2] . Had appropriate adjustment for these variables been made it is feasible that the results of the study might have not demonstrated a difference. In a recent French study on the same topic, patients with asthma, COPD and chronic use of steroids were correctly excluded [3] .",
