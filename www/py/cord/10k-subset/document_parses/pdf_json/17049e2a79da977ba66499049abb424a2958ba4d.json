When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1,239 replacements (544 transitions, 695 transversions), the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval 50 to 56) compared with the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared with that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, the available data have the power to verify the \"conservative transitions\" hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Of the 12 types of changes from one nucleotide to another, 8 are \"transversions\" between a purine (A or G) and a pyrimidine (C or T), and the other 4 are \"transitions.\" Early protein comparisons showed that related proteins often differ by transitions more than expected by chance (Fitch 1967; sources cited in Vogel 1972) .

As the use of rate models became routine in comparative sequence analysis, the phenomenon of transition bias was redefined as a bias in instantaneous rates, relative to a null model of equal rates. Because every nucleotide site (e.g., a G site) may experience 1 type of transition (G!A) at rate a, and 2 types of transversion (G!C, G!T) at rate b, the aggregate rate ratio of transitions to transversions has a null expectation of R = a=(2b) = 0.5. In some contexts, the ratio is expressed differently as = a=b = 1. When considering amino acid changes, it is more relevant to compare the 116 possible transitions and 276 possible transversions that change a codon so as to encode a different amino acid (assuming the canonical genetic code), leading to a null expectation of R = 116a/(276b) = 0.42a=b. Thus, the observation of roughly equal numbers of inferred transitions and transversions in classic works (Vogel and Kopun 1977) , or in the extensive analysis of mammalian genes in Li (1997, table 7 .2), indicates a bias of over 2-fold. Kumar (1996) estimates 2-fold to 5-fold rate biases in vertebrate mitochondrial genes (excluding 3rd positions). Other estimates may be found in the work cited by Rosenberg et al.

As the threshold increases, AUC decreases (rather than increases), although the differences are insignificant. conservative replacements relative to radical ones is 2.7. That is, conservative replacements as defined by U B are 2.7-fold more likely to be accepted in evolution than radical ones. This pair of values, AUC = 0.64 and evolutionary bias = 2.7, represents one point in the relationship between evolutionary acceptability and classification power for mutant fitness effects. There is another point where AUC = 0.5 (no power) and evolutionary bias = 1 (no effect). We can fill in the relationship further by randomizing U B , as shown in figure 3 . The results show that, when about 75 % of the values are randomized, U B has an AUC of 0.53, equal to that of the transition:transversion distinction. This corresponds to an evolutionary bias of 1.3. The CI of AUC from 0.50 to 0.56 for the transition:transversion distinction corresponds to the interval of 1.0 to 1.6 in evolutionary bias. That is, the expected evolutionary effect of the transition:transversion bias is a 1.3-fold bias, with a CI of 1.0 (no effect) to 1.6.

The idea of mutation and selection as opposing forces suggests that mutation bias will be influential only when selection is absent, thus hypotheses that invoke mutation bias are often interpreted as neutral models (as noted by Yampolsky and Stoltzfus 2001) . Presumably, this is why researchers have pursued selective explanations for transition:transversion bias among amino acid changes, even while accepting a mutational explanation for noncoding changes in the same genes: the proteins are assumed to be \"under selection\" and thus not susceptible to mutation bias. However, this way of depicting mutation and selection as opposing forces is only justified under the special conditions of the gene pool regime.
