There were 167 episodes of gastrointestinal illness in the 104 infants, with diarrhea occurring with or without other symptoms in 153 of these episodes (table 1). In the 62 siblings there were 70 episodes of gastroenteritis, including 52 diarrheal episodes, a rate of about 0.8 per child per year. In the newborn cohort, agespecific attack rates were calculated for each sixmonth interval through 23 months of age (table 2) ; both gastroenteritis and rotavirus infection were relatively uncommon in the first six months of life compared with later six-month intervals. The gastroenteritis rate for infants younger than six months of age was 0.047 per infant per month, but in later six-month intervals the rate was almost three times higher. The rotavirus infection rate for the first six months of life was 0.003 per month but increased >lO-fold, ranging from 0.037 to 0.054, for the later age intervals. In the winter months (defined as October through April in Manitoba [5] ), the rate was as high as 0.079 per child per month. Although in the first six months of life gastroenteritis was common during summer months, it was less common in summer months in older infants. The increase in gastroenteritis during winter in older infants appeared to be due mainly to rotavirus because the gastroenteritis rates in summer and winter months would have been similar if gastroenteritis associated with rotavirus was excluded. Etiology. The most common gastrointestinal pathogen was rotavirus, although most episodes of gastroenteritis were not associated with any recognized pathogen (table 1) . Rotavirus was associated with 39 (23070) of 167 episodes of gastroenteritis in the neonates and 20 (28%) of 70 episodes in their siblings, but 102 (61%) of episodes of gastroenteritis in the neonates and 44 (63%) in their siblings could not be associated with a recognized pathogen. However, if we consider only episodes of gastroenteritis in which both diarrhea and vomiting occurred, 36 (72%) of 50 episodes in infants and seven (33%) of 21 in their siblings were associated with rotavirus. Other etiologic agents accounted for a relatively small number of episodes of gastroenteritis. Enteropathogenic E. coli, the second most common pathogen, was present in 10 episodes of gastroenteritis in the newborn cohort (although three of these episodes were dual infections with rotavirus and one was a dual infection with adenovirus); this pathogen was found in two episodes in the siblings. Adenovirus was associated with six episodes of gastroenteritis in the newborn cohort and one in their siblings. Other pathogens associated with gastroenteritis included coronavirus in three episodes, toxigenic A. hydrophila in five, coxsackievirus B2 in two, parainfluenza virus in two, Salmonella infantis in one, enterotoxigenic E. coli in one, poliovirus in three, and Norwalk virus in one.

Factors predisposing to rotavirus infection, other than season or age, were difficult to identify. Seventy-seven (94070) of the rotavirus infections occurred during the seven months from October to April, a period that may be considered \"winter\" in Manitoba. In the neonatal cohort, only two cases of rotavirus occurred before six months of age, but by two years of age, by a life-table type of analysis, only 38070 had not experienced a rotavirus infection. Although infection was uncommon before six months of age, neither breast-feeding nor the presence of maternal (cord blood) antibody to rotavirus correlated with protection from infection. Rotavirus infection occurred in 16 (55070) of 29 infants not breastfed, compared with 29 (39070) of 75 infants who were breast-fed (X 2 = 2.32; P < 0.20). In addition, the presence of a titer of antibody to rotavirus of 1:10 in cord blood did not seem protective. Thirty-seven (42070) of 88 newborn infants with a titer of antibody of~1:10 developed rotavirus infection, a rate similar to the 50070 rate (eight of 16) in those born with less than this level of antibody.

The rate of rotavirus infection in siblings with this level of antibody throughout the study or immediately before rotavirus infection was 16 The male:female ratio among children with rotavirus infection (41 :31) was slightly greater than the ratio among those children not developing rotavirus infection (49:45). It was difficult to determine the sequence of infection in families in which there was more than one rotavirus infection. The neonates appeared to be affected first in many cases, but this observation may have been biased by the greater severity of vomiting and diarrhea in the infants than in their older siblings. The older siblings did not appear to play an essential role in transmission of rotavirus infection in our study. In fact, the infection rate among infants without siblings (51070 of 53) was higher than the infection rate among infants with siblings (45070 of 51). In families with only one child, there may have been other sources of exposure to rotavirus, such as attendance at a day-care center, having parents who brought other children into the home for babysitting, or having one or both parents whose jobs required contact with children.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1075, "end": 1078, "text": "16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1365, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "12.29)."}, {"text": "Although we attempted to identify the cause of all episodes of gastroenteritis, in the majority of episodes of diarrhea no etiologic agent was identified.

Rotavirus infection was as common in infants who were breast-fed as in those who were not and as common in those infants with maternally acquired antibody as in those without. Because<20070 of the infants were not breast-fed, a larger study might have shown a protective effect of breast-feeding against rotavirus infection. However, the results of our parallel studies of diarrhea in an isolated native Indian settlement and in an Inuit (Eskimo) settlement do not support a protective role for breast-feeding. In the Inuit settlement, where breast-feeding was nearly universal, the rate of rotavirus infection was higher than in Winnipeg and higher than in the native Indian settlement, where <5070 of the infants were breast-fed at any time (authors' unpublished observations). It is possible that other forms of gastrointestinal immunity in infants younger than six months of age account for the lower incidence of rotavirus infection in this age group and that most of the infants are no longer being breast-fed after six months of age, when they are at greater risk from rotavirus infection. However, several nosocomial rotavirus epidemics involving neonatal nurseries have been described [10, 11] . In one of these outbreaks, it was shown that neither maternally acquired serum antibodies to rotavirus nor antibody to rotavirus in breast milk correlated with protection against rotavirus infection [10] . Although it has been postulated that rotavirus infection occurs in young infants because the virus is brought into the home by older siblings, we were unable to find a difference in rate of rotavirus infection among infants with or without siblings. It is likely that rotavirus infection is so prevalent that only brief exposure to other children is required or .hat there is enough asymptomatic infection of rarents to account for transmission to infants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1459, "end": 1463, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1467, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1673, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Reinfection or second infection with rotavirus occurred 10 times.

The presence of antibody to rotavirus, in cord blood or immediately before infection, did not seem to correlate with protection either against infection or against clinical disease in those acquiring infection. One possible explanation is that preexisting antibody was specific for a serotype other than the one causing the infection. Another possibility is that even if serum antibody does contain neutralizing antibody to the infecting serotype, local gastrointestinal antibody may be required. Because in our present study and in other studies [1, [10] [11] [12] the antibody responses detected were not necessarily those of neutralizing antibody, we cannot evaluate these two possibilities on the basis of 223 available data. It is interesting that children who were symptomatic with their initial rotavirus infection were also symptomatic during a second rotavirus infection.

Vomiting, especially 1-24 hr before the onset of diarrhea, was uncommon in diarrheal episodes with other etiologies, including those without a diagnosis. Vomiting almost always occurred in the infants, although it was seen less frequently in older siblings and parents. Some young children and infants either complained of abdominal pain or gas or gave the appearance of suffering from abdominal pain by pulling up their legs. This nonspecific abdominal pain was also noted in parents symptomatic with rotavirus infection [5] . Thus, diarrheal illness associated with vomiting and/or abdominal pain and occurring during the winter months was likely to be caused by rotavirus. Although Norwalk virus and related viruses have been described as \"winter vomiting disease,\" these viruses are not particularly associated with the winter season [17] , are uncommon in young children [18] , and were uncommon in our study. In the parents of these children respiratory symptoms occurred commonly; in 18 children the only symptoms associated with rotavirus infection were in the upper respiratory tract. The significance of the increased respiratory symptomatology in children with rotavirus infection is unclear. Although the winter predominance of rotavirus and the increased occurrence of respiratory symptoms [3, 16] in rotavirus infection suggest a possible respiratory mode of spread for this virus, to our knowledge respiratory spread has not yet been documented. When looked for specifically, rotavirus was not shown to be present in the upper airway or its secretions [3, 19] . However, the coincidence of increased frequency of rotavirus infection and increased frequency of some respiratory viral infections, due to agents such as influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus, during winter months seems inadequate to explain the statistical association of respiratory symptoms with rota-virus infection in our study.
