Here, we explore the consequences of the protonation state of another histidine (H59), only conserved within FoxM/O/P subfamilies, on folding and dimerization of the forkhead domain of human FoxP1. Dimer dissociation kinetics and equilibrium unfolding experiments demonstrate that protonation of H59 leads to destabilization of the domain-swapped dimer due to an increase in free energy difference between the monomeric and transition states. This pH-dependence is abolished when H59 is mutated to alanine. Furthermore, anisotropy measurements and molecular dynamics evidence that H59 has a direct impact in the local stability of helix H3.
