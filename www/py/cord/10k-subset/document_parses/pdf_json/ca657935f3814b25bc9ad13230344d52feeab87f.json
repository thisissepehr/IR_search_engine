The viral load of the seasonal influenza usually shed for 5 days in adults [27, 28] . The 2009 H1N1 shed for a median of 5 days (3 to 6) [14] . The current results showed that H7N9 could be shed for a longer period of time than 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza. A study showed that a longer viral shedding interval to be related to severe illness in H7N9 patients [21] . Similar findings were observed in influenza A(H1N1) patients [1] . In influenza H1N1, the early treatment within 2 days of onset of symptoms could reduce the duration viral RNA shedding [14] . Studies have reported that delayed treatment with oseltamivir may be related to delayed viral clearance [26] . Prolonged positive viral RNA had been shown to correlate with morbidity in hospital [26] . In the current study, the delayed administration of NAIs might contribute to the high morbidity. Therefore, the early initiation of NAIs is recommended. There are several limitations to the current study. First, it was a retrospective study and the sample size was too small for robust investigation in subgroups of patients. Despite the use of a standardized case-report form, not all information was available for all 82 patients. Secondly, the H7N9 viral RNA of these 82 cases was not sequenced for analysis of antiviral resistance. It was not possible to determine whether there were any mutations associated with resistance to NAIs in either group, especially the NA-R292K. Third, the dosage of oseltamivir and peramivir varied widely. The heterogeneity may influence the antiviral effect of two groups. Fourthly, most people in our study received NAIs more than 5 days, not the optimal time. It may influence the effect of the NAIs. Further prospective clinical studies should be performed to compare the effect between NAI monotherapy and combination therapy with two NAIs with standardization NAI administration.
