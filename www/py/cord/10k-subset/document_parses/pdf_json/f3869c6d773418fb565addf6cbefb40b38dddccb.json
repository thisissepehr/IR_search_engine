            "text": "I n late March 2009, the outbreak of a respiratory illness in Mexico was later proved to be caused by a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus of swine origin (S-OIV). [1] At the start of winter in southern hemisphere, the virus was spread to China and resulted in approximately 80% infl uenza cases. [2] Most patients infected by influenza A virus of S-OIV typically presented with fever, cough, sore throat, chills, headache, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, vomiting, or diarrhea; however, some patients demonstrated severe course of infection that might result in respiratory failure and death. [3, 4] The spread of the virus to China also affected a large number of pediatric patients, many of whom were admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU). A proportion of these patients presented, or developed, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, it is essential for clinicians to recognize the possible cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza in highrisk groups, thereby allowing the selection of the appropriate diagnostic tests, specific antiviral therapy, and intensive supportive measures as necessary. The role of radiographic images in epidemic detection and response is evolving with the use of imaging as a tool to identify, predict or diagnose severe cases. [5, 6] Descriptions of the radiological manifestations of S-OIV have been limited to a few case reports. [3, 7, 8] In this article, we review the chest radiographic and CT findings in pediatric patients with confirmed S-OIV H1N1 infection who were treated at a PICU in China.",

Ninety-seven children who underwent chest radiographic imaging and/or CT constituted the study population. The study population consisted of 59 boys and 38 girls with a mean age of 3.9 years (range: 8 months to 13 years). The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised 42 patients who developed a rapid, severe respiratory failure that was unresponsive to helmet-CPAP and required intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV). Group 2 comprised the remaining 55 patients who manifested dyspnea and required hospitalization but no invasive MV. Given the different clinical course between the two groups, the radiographic findings in each group were described separately.",

Some of the chest radiographic images were taken in a local hospital or in a clinic at our hospital, and were unable to be reviewed by PACS, then we performed additional imaging. When the illness was too severe for patients to be moved out of PICU, portable radiographic examinations were performed with digital radiography equipments using a standardized technique. Ninetyseven patients had follow-up chest radiography (42 in group 1 and 55 in group 2) within one week of the initial chest radiographic imaging. In patients whose illness progressed quickly but the condition remained well or the death risk was low, CT scan was performed. If the condition of the patient was instable, CT scans should not be performed. Chest CT examinations were performed in 63 patients (18 in group 1 and 45 in group 2; children in group 1 were too serious to be taken out for CT scans, so CT scans in group 1 were less than in group 2). Radiographs and CT scans were assessed by trained radiologists of radiology department who were not involved in the analysis for the presence of groundglass opacities, consolidation, a tree-in-bud pattern, reticular opacities and honeycomb lung. The presence of associated hilar, mediastinal, or pleural abnormalities was also assessed. Ground-glass opacities were defined as hazy areas of increased opacity or attenuation without obscuring of the underlying vessels. Consolidation was defined as a homogeneous opacity of the parenchyma with obscuring of the underlying vessels. Reticular opacities were defined as linear opacities that formed a mesh-like pattern. Honeycomb lung was defined as the radiological and gross appearance of the lungs resulting from diffuse fibrosis and cystic dilation of bronchioles. The involvement was categorized as unilateral or bilateral. If the involvement was deemed bilateral, the process was categorized as symmetric or asymmetric in nature. Each lung was divided into upper, middle, and lower lung zones (each comprising a third of the craniocaudal extent of the lungs on a frontal radiograph), and the zonal involvement was assessed. The extent of abnormality was subjectively graded as the percentage of each lung involved, and an average was calculated for each radiographic study. The distribution was categorized as 1/4 quadrants per lung in total, 2/4 quadrants and 3/4 or more involved zones of one lung. A predominant distribution was also assessed with respect to location in the upper, middle, or lower lung zone. Both groups demonstrated a high ratio of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Based on the site, we classified the radiographic findings into mediastinal emphysema, cutaneous emphysema and pneumatothorax.",

            "text": "We examined the chest images of the children who underwent serial imaging consecutively after hospitalization in the PICU. The initial chest radiographic images available for review were obtained at an average of 5.1 days (range: 2-9 days) after the onset of clinical symptoms, at clinic visit or on hospital admission. The mean time from initial symptoms to the first obtained imaging study in group 1 was 5.0 days, whereas it was 5.3 days in group 2 (P>0.05). The mean time from admission to the onset of MV was 18 hours (0-70 hours), and to the chest radiographic examination was 2 days (1-5 days) for mechanically ventilated group 1. The imaging findings are summarized in the Table. Among the 42 patients who received MV, the median length of hospital stay was 19 days (range: 1-56) as compared with 14 days (range: 6-20) in group 2 (P=0.073).When the patients were admitted to the PICU, chest radiographic examination was performed. The calculated mean times for obtaining the chest radiograph after admission was 6.71 in group 1 and 3.36 in group 2 (P<0.001). The lung abnormalities were bilateral in 33 (78.6%) patients in group 1, and in 50 (90.1%) patients in group 2. Initial chest radiography revealed no significant differences between the two groups. However, 9 patients in group 1 showed a bilateral abnormality on the radiographic images within a week (Fig. 2) . The pattern of radiographic abnormality was evaluated when the patients were in the most serious conditions, i.e., the degree of hypoxemia was worst or vent settings were most high. Based on abnormalities in chest radiography, the ratio of local patchy shadowing ( Fig. 2A, 3A, 3B) to ground-glass opacities (Fig. 2D, 3D ) was found to be 47:50. The percentage of ground-glass opacities was 71.4% in group 1 and 36.4% in group 2 (P<0.001). Lung abnormalities were most commonly detected in the lower and central lung zones (41/97 and 43/97 respectively), but there was no difference in the two groups. There were diffuse abnormalities on chest radiographies of the 9 patients in group 1 and 6 patients in group 2. CT therefore could distinguish the lung zone that was predominantly affected (Figs. 2-4) . The extent of the disease was greater in the group 1 patients that required MV, demonstrating the involvement of three or more lung zones in 24/42 (57.1%) patients as compared with 5/55 (9.1%) of the patients in group 2. In addition, the overall extent of lung involvement was 2/4 in 12 patients in group 1 in contrast to 15 patients in group 2. The extent of lung involvement was 1/4 quadrants in 6 patients of group 1 versus 35 patients of group 2 (P<0.001). Pneumatothorax and pneumohypoderma were the most common complications (Fig. 4) . Mediastinal emphysema was usually followed by pneumohypoderma. Irrespective of whether the patients had undergone MV, they should present pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax, therefore, there was no relationship between MV and pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. This condition was observed in 24 and 18 patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P=0.019). Pulmonary interstitial emphysema occurred almost exclusively in association with MV. Extensive cystic and linear densities were noted and were thought to represent pulmonary interstitial emphysema and fibrosis respectively. After prolonged treatment, the patients survived, but multiple cysts formed in their lungs. Neither chest radiograph nor chest CT showed pleural effusions.",

            "text": "The medical literature contains few presentations of radiographic findings in seasonal influenza, possibly because of the non-specificity of this condition and the frequent confounding features due to co-infection Radiographic and CT fi ndings in a 10-year-old girl. A: Four days after onset of symptoms (the first admission day), the first radiograph showed patchy air-space consolidation in the left middle lung zone associated with ill-defined nodules. Mild consolidation is evident in the right lower lobe. B: Three days after admission, the lesion of the lungs spread rapidly. The radiograph showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infi ltrates, indistinct margins, tendency to coalesce, and the presence of air bronchogram or silhouette sign (effacement of an anatomical softtissue border due to adjacent consolidation). Spontaneous mediastinal emphesema was seen on the chest radiograph. C: Ten days after admission, after 7 days of MV, secondary infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lung was found. The chest radiograph showed diffuse alveolar infi ltrates. D: CT scan showed air bronchogram, ground-glass opacity, bilateral air-space consolidation and multi cysts after 20 days of hospital stay. E: Two months after discharging from hospital, CT scan showed that multi cysts were present with diffuse lung grand-glass opacities, compared with D. and multifactorial lung injury; most cases are not sufficiently severe to warrant imaging. Historically, seasonal influenza has been associated with heightened mortality due to superinfection with community acquired pneumonia, in which the radiographic pattern may be lobar and nonsegmental. [13] [14] [15] [16] This fi nding is in contrast to the multifocal patchy peripheral distribution and groundglass opacities observed herein, corroborating previous preliminary reports in adults. [3, 8, 17, 18] Although some patients presented with a clinically poor situation, their chest radiographic images were only slightly abnormal, and the images changed very quickly as the disease developed. The abnormalities changed from unilateral to bilateral, single focal areas of consolidation to multifocal, local patchy shadowing and then to diffuse pathological changes. There were more bilaterally abnormalities than unilaterally abnormalities, which might be due in part to the severity of the illness, the decreased immunocompetence of the patients or unconventional treatments before admission. Additionally, comorbidities have complicated the imaging findings. [19] [20] [21] Fourteen children in group 1 and 6 children in group 2 demonstrated one or two episodes of hospital-acquired bacterial infections (5 cases of baumani, 5 cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 cases of Escherichia coli, 3 cases of Pseudomonas maltophilia, 2 cases of Staphylococcus aureus and 2 cases of Klebsiella pneumoniae). All of the infections were diagnosed via bronchoalveolar lavage, and the patients were subjected to prolonged treatment, which modified the features of chest radiographic images. In a recently published series of 18 cases of fatal S-OIV infection in Mexico, [3] the investigators reported that patchy bilateral opacities were observed on the radiographs of all patients and that one CT image revealed a ground-glass airspace density. Although that report provided a limited description of the radiographic features of these cases, the fi ndings were consistent with the present results and provided details concerning the characterization of lung injury resulting from S-OIV H1N1. The pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax morbidity in our cases was higher than that reported in previous adult cases. [3, 3, 8, 17, 18] Among the patients, 43.1% had pneumatothorax or pneumohypoderma, which was spontaneous in 23 children. Another 19 children presented with an accompanying pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax after MV, but we could not confirm the outcome of MV. The viral infection might have led to necrosis of the terminal bronchiole, thus inducing a spontaneous pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. CT revealed the development of ground-glass opacity cyst in 17 patients after long-term treatment; however, the causes of such result were unclear. A greater number of patients in group 1 developed honeycombing, which may be associated with the severity of the disease and MV. These cases of severe S-OIV infection suggested a noncardiogenic lung injury or ARDS. In ARDS, respiratory epithelial injury with an abnormally increased permeability of the capillary endothelium initially produces patchy consolidations on CTs and radiographs and then evolves into a confl uent bilateral air-space opacity. In our patients, ARDS was associated with a pattern of severe lung injury involving alveolitis, interstitial substance damage and peribronchial inflammation. If a child was subjected to chest radiography that showed bilateral lung involvement or a large area of opacity, the probability of MV for the child would be very high. The patients in group 1 were given MV 18 hours after admission, with fi ndings consistent with those of Perez-Padilla, showing that the time from hospitalization to MV might be as short as 24 hours or less. [3] Two patients were complicated with lung hemorrhage in the early phase of the disease and finally died. The incidence of hemorrhage might be related to injury of the alveola caused by virus or macrophages and neutrophils infiltration. [22] Another reason might be the increasing lung artery permeability which was induced by systemic infl ammatory response syndrome. Also it might be related with lung artery injury that was caused by virus infection. Besides, high positive end-expiratory pressure in MV could stop the bleeding, which might have something to do with the former reason.",

Children with bilateral involvement or a greater opacity on the chest radiographs were more likely to worsen and require ventilation. MV increased the incidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Based on the radiographic data, we were able to immediately discover the extent of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. The groundglass opacities and areas of consolidation exhibited a predominantly peribronchovascular and subpleural distribution on the CT that resembled the appearance of developing pneumonia. Laterally, the chest CT displayed some insidious processes such as groundglass opacity cyst (honeycombing), which signifi ed that some patients would develop bronchiolitis obliterans, and these features were not easily identifi ed on the chest radiograph.",

Due to the central airway involvement there were peripheral air trapping and hyperinfl ation. Patchy pulmonary densities can be seen and are usually due to subsegmental atelectasis. C: Eight days after onset of symptoms, ground-glass opacities were observed in the left lung and multiple patchy shadowing in the right lung. D: Fourteen days after onset of symptoms, the child developed pneumomediastinum and secondary infection with baumanii. Both lungs showed ground-glass opacities. E: The child was on a ventilator for 44 days, follow-up radiography at 50 days after onset of symptoms showed patchy bilateral linear opacities and development of multiple thin-walled cystic lucencies. F: CT taken at 59 days after onset of symptoms showed a diffuse pattern of well-circumscribed cysts. The cysts had a diffuse homogeneous appearance throughout the lungs. The lung area between the cysts had a ground-glass opacity on CT. The lung was characterized by irregular linear opacities and honeycombing that involved mainly the subpleural regions.

A: The fi rst fi lm taken at 4 days after onset of symptoms showed acute interstitial lung infi ltrates with interstitial pulmonary edema and lung marking coarse. B&C: Eight days after onset of symptoms, his dyspnea was more severe. CT showed multiple pulmonary nodules of different sizes and with variations in sharpness of nodular margins. Normal lung was limited. D: Fourteen days after onset of symptoms, the image showed diffuse ground-glass opacity on both lungs. E: Sixteen days after onset of symptoms, after mechanical ventilation for 7 days, bilateral airspace densities and small right pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum were seen. F: Forty-four days after onset of symptoms, with deterioration in the child status, pneumothorax on both sides was seen along with three drainage tubes (two in the right lobe and one in the left). Pneumomediastinum and pneumohypoderma were severe. The heart was greatly oppressed by the distended lungs. The patient had a bronchopleural fi stula.
