There has been a worldwide situation regarding avian influenza infections in poultry since 1997. Recently, H5N1 caused severe disease with high mortality in humans in Vietnam and Thailand. 1 Most infected patients usually developed progressive pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and consequently died. It is postulated that, in fatal human infections with this avian subtype, the initial virus replication in the respiratory tract triggers hypercytokinemia complicated by other organ involvement. 2 Renal involvement of bird flu infection has been reported. To et al. 2 recently reported the autopsy findings of acute renal failure (ARF) in fatal human bird flu infection. However, the pathogenesis underling the renal involvement in still not clarified. Wiwanitkit 3 recently noted that hypercreatinemia could be an important manifestation of human bird flu infection.",

The author also reviewed the published works in all 256 local Thai journals, which are not included in the international citation index, for reports of human bird flu infection in Thailand.

Of these 9, renal insufficiency was detected on presentation in 4 patients (44.4%). In all 4 of these patients with renal insufficiency, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was detected, and all died. Concerning the other 5 patients without renal insufficiency, ARDS was detected in 4, and there were 2 fatalities. Although the fatality rate in the patients with renal insufficiency was higher than that in those without, there was no significant correlation between the presence of renal insufficiency and the development of ARDS (P > 0.05) or fatality (P > 0.05).",
