Although the first isolates were from Nigeria and other Congo basin countries, all reports over the past 20 years have been from southern Africa. Previous phylogenetic studies analyzed few isolates or used partial gene sequence for analysis since limited sequence information is available for MOKV and the isolates were distributed among various laboratories. The complete nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix and glycoprotein genes of 18 MOKV isolates in various laboratories were sequenced either using partial or full genome sequencing using pyrosequencing and a phylogenetic analysis was undertaken. The results indicated that MOKV isolates from the Republic of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Central African Republic and Nigeria clustered according to geographic origin irrespective of the genes used for phylogenetic analysis, similar to that observed with Lagos bat virus. A Bayesian Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo-(MCMC) analysis revealed the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of MOKV to be between 279 and 2034 years depending on the genes used.

LBV, MOKV, DUVV and SHIBV occur exclusively in Africa. SHIBV was recently isolated from Hipposideros vittatus (formerly known as H. commersoni) [3] .

The only isolations from humans were in 1968 and 1971 from two girls from Nigeria [6, 8, 9] . However, there were no classical signs of rabies in either of these cases. Whilst the 1968 isolation was made from the cerebrospinal fluid of a girl who presented with fever and convulsions but fully recovered with no neurological damage, the 1971 isolate was from the brain of a girl who died of a poliomyelitis-like encephalitic disease. A further isolation was made in 1974 from a shrew (Crocidura spp.) in Yaounde, Cameroon [10] . The only isolation from a rodent (Lophuromys sikapusi) was in 1981, from Bangui, Central African Republic [11] . MOKV was also isolated from other animal species including companion animals. A survey on lyssaviruses undertaken in Zimbabwe between 1981 and 1984 revealed six isolations of MOKV from domestic animals, namely a dog and cats that had been previously vaccinated against rabies and unvaccinated cats [12, 13] . In 1989 MOKV was isolated from a cat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia [14] . No further isolation of MOKV was made in Zimbabwe until 1993, when the virus was again isolated from a domestic cat [15] . In the Republic of South Africa, the first isolation was made in 1970 from a domestic cat in Umhlanga Rocks, Kwa-Zulu Natal Province (KZN) [16] . At the time the isolate was assumed to be RABV and the isolate was only identified retrospectively using antigenic typing with monoclonal antibodies during the discovery of MOKV in Zimbabwe in the 1980s [17] . Twenty five years later, in 1995, MOKV was isolated from a domestic cat in South Africa, this time from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape Province (EC) [17] . Two more isolations followed in 1996, one each in KZN and EC and both from domestic cats of which one was vaccinated against rabies [18, 19] . In 1997 and 1998 three more isolations were made from rabiesvaccinated cats in KZN [18, 19] . Following several years in which MOKV was not encountered, two isolations were from rabiesvaccinated domestic cats in 2006 and 2008 from the EC province and these are the most recent known isolations of this virus [20, 21] . From South Africa all isolations of MOKV were from a domestic cat. Viral RNA was detected by PCR from a domestic dog (in 2005) from Mpumalanga Province of South Africa, virus isolation was unsuccessful in this case [20] . A summary of all MOKV isolates and the approximate geographic location of their origin are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . Generally, MOKV infected domestic animals were not observed to be particularly aggressive, but displayed other rabies-like signs that included dehydration, unusual behavior, hypersensitivity, neurological disturbance and salivation [19] .

However, no rabies vaccine provided complete protection against MOKV [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] . More evidence that RABV derived vaccines do not protect against MOKV infection is shown by circumstantial evidence of the fatal infections of numerous domestic animals that had been vaccinated against RABV [13, 18, 19, 20, 21] . Given this scenario and the apparent obscurity of MOKV, we argue that much more information is needed to improve our scant understanding of the epidemiology, disease dynamics and the ecology of this virus. Some phylogenetic studies have been undertaken on MOKV [18, 20, 21, 33, 34] , but these studies were invariably performed on a smaller number of isolates and limited to partial gene sequences. Despite these limitations, these studies provided some evidence of the existence of different virus clusters, delineated according to geographical incidence. Generally, the genetic variance was shown to be inversely related to the spatial distribution of isolates. For example, South African MOKV isolates were shown to be closely related, but distinguishable based on province and as a cluster more distant from those made in a neighboring country, Zimbabwe [21, 33, 34] . Such patterns of genetic diversity may indicate extended periods of isolated evolution, as have been reported for terrestrial rabies virus variants [35] .

The MOKV isolates also displayed less sequence divergence than that seen among LBV isolates (20.9% nucleotide sequence difference and 6.7% amino acid sequence difference between LBV isolates).

Also, purifying selection can mask the ancient age of viruses that appear to have recent origins as shown for other RNA-viruses [52, 53] , thus making it difficult to objectively model the evolutionary history of MOKV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 204, "end": 208, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 548, "end": 551, "text": "53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Use of NGS technologies to obtain four of the MOKV genomes directly from RNA preparations without amplification using specific primers was highly successful. Unlike the approach taken for the other isolates where often primers had to be designed for each specific isolate due to the high divergence seen in the sequences between the MOKV viruses, for the NGS approach 294 and 1006 reads per position the inclusion of sequencing errors are highly unlikely. Twenty three MOKV isolations and one PCR-based identification have been made to date from six African countries in a period of more than 40 years. Since these African countries are from regions in Africa that are far apart, it is likely that MOKV is present in many others African countries and spread over vast portions of the continent. Moreover, over the past almost 20 years MOKV has only been isolated from South Africa (Fig. 1) . Since it is known that MOKV is not only limited to South Africa, the lack of isolation from elsewhere is reflective of the non-existence of appropriate surveillance, including for rabies virus, across Africa. Limited diagnostic capabilities (e.g. typing or sequencing of rabies cases/specimens/isolates) across the continent, remains a key factor. Such enhanced surveillance would likely result in the discovery of more isolates and therefore, a higher diversity of MOKV and would thus improve our understanding of MOKV incidence and circulation. Since rabies vaccines do not offer protection against MOKV, a case can be made for the relative importance of a better understanding of the ecology of MOKV [32] . One of the limiting factors in studying MOKV is the fact that the reservoir species for this virus is not known. Although shrews have been implicated, it remains speculative. Lyssaviruses have a strong association with bats and it seems peculiar that MOKV may be the only exception in this regard -among all the other members of the genus. Indeed, virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA), neutralizing both LBV and MOKV have been detected in sera from frugivorous bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus and Eidolon helvum) [54, 55, 56] . However, belonging to the same phylogroup II, LBV and MOKV have been reported to cross react in serological assays [7, 24, 45, 57] . Since there have been repeated reports of LBV isolations from fruit bats [58, 59] , the neutralizing activity of bat sera to MOKV apparently does not confirm the circulation of MOKV in those bat species. However, it cannot be excluded that other yet unidentified African bats may act as reservoir for MOKV. On the other hand, consistent encounters of MOKV in domestic cats and small mammalian species invite speculation along the lines of a prey-to-predator transmission pathway. For MOKV, the estimated MRCA from our study coincides and provides support for the timeframe suggested for the emergence of terrestrial rabies [47] . It is possible that MOKV remained stable in an extant African host environment, while RABV evolution was vastly accelerated given a plethora of host opportunities and global distribution.
