We have used a recombinant retroviral expression vector encoding anglerfish prepro-SRIF-l to infect rat pituitary GH 3 cells. The aim of these studies was to investigate the intracellular storage and secretion of the total pool of endogenous GH compared to that of SRIF. Several clonal lines of GH 3 cells expressing high or low levels of SRIF were treated with TRH, forskolin, or depolarizing concentrations of potassium, and the levels of intracellular and secreted GH or SRIF were determined using highly sensitive RIAs. Approximately 65% of the total GH was secreted basally, whereas less than 20% of the SRIF-immunoreactive material was basally secreted. Forskolin treatment or potassium depolarization stimulated GH release, but only about 50% above basal levels. In contrast, SRIF secretion was stimulated approximately 5-fold in response to these secretagogues. Based on its lower basal rate of secretion compared to GH and its enhanced release in response to a variety of secretagogues, we conclude that the heterologously expressed SRIF is preferentially targeted to the regulated pathway in GH 3 cells.

Approximately 75% of the intracellular precursor was cleaved to mature SRIF, and at least half of this material was targeted to the regulated pathway (16, 17) . In contrast, 95% of newly synthesized endogenous GH was delivered to the constitutive pathway; consequently, it was concluded that GH 3 cells discriminate between and store a foreign protein significantly more efficiently than the endogenous hormone. Since these studies used a pulse-chase experimental protocol, it was possible that we were measuring only a relatively small fraction of the endogenous GH or heterologous SRIF pools in these cells, i.e. the rapidly turning over newly synthesized molecules. It could be argued that the total steady state pools of these two hormones, comprising both old (long term storage) and nascent molecules, might not be differentially packaged or secreted. Thus, the preferential sorting of pro-SRIF to the regulated pathway may be a function of its biosynthetic rate compared to GH or to differences in relative pool sizes of these two hormones rather than to differences in packaging efficiency per se. To address these possibilities, we employed direct measurement of the total stored and secreted levels of both SRIF and GH using RIA.

The cells were treated with depolarizing concentrations of potassium (46 mM), TRH, or forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, and the release of GH and SRIF into the medium was determined ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). Under basal conditions, GH release was linear for 2 h, and TRH minimally enhanced its secretion.

Furthermore, the content measured under basal conditions was equal to the total hormone level in the presence of cycloheximide (Table 3) . Hence, net production of GH (synthesis minus degradation) was reflected by the amount secreted. Over a 2-h incubation the secretion i.e. production, of GH was 3-4 times that of SRIF in clone 9 cells ( Table 3 ). The cellular content of SRIF from cells incubated in the absence or presence of cycloheximide was similar (1.9 pmol/10 6 cells compared to 1.5 pmol/10 6 cells, respectively; Table 3 ). In contrast, the GH content was reduced from 0.93 to 0.24 pmol/10 6 cells in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that GH synthesis was approximately 3-fold greater than that of SRIF. To examine whether the increased rate of GH synthesis played a role in the distribution of GH and SRIF, basal and forskolin-stimulated release were examined in the presence and absence of cycloheximide (Table 3) . Even though total GH was decreased 3-fold in the presence of cycloheximide, the percentages of total GH secreted basally and in response to forskolin were not significantly different. SRIF secretion in cycloheximide-treated cells was low in the absence of secretagogue, and consistent with the data in Fig. 1 , its secretion responded to forskolin stimulation much more dramatically than did GH (Table 3 ). These data demonstrate that maintenance of the intracellular pool of GH was dependent on ongoing protein synthesis; in contrast, the intracellular SRIF pool was relatively independent of synthesis, i.e. it was stored.

The basal level of GH secretion was high (50-65% of the total) and was stimulated approximately 20% by forskolin (Fig. 2) . However, as observed for clone 9 cells, the basal release of SRIF was low (ranging from 4% in clone 8 to -1 0 % of the total for clone 18) and was stimulated about 6-fold by forskolin. Thus, although these clones expressed lower levels of SRIF than GH3SI8.9 cells, the response to secretagogues was identical, further demonstrating that the differential sorting of SRIF and GH was not a function of the level of hormone synthesis. SRIF has a multitude of biological effects, one of which is to inhibit GH secretion from the pituitary. Earlier work had demonstrated that treatment of GH 3 cells with high concentrations of SRIF resulted in decreased GH secretion (20) . Therefore, we might have expected that SRIF production by GH 3 S18 cells would alter the release of GH from these cells; however, this did not seem to be the case (Fig. 2) .

Our results indicate that the heterologously expressed hormone SRIF is preferentially targeted to the regulated secretory pathway in GH 3 cells compared to endogenous GH. This conclusion is based on the lower basal rate of SRIF secretion compared to GH, the greater dependence of SRIF release on extracellular calcium, and its enhanced stimulation upon treatment of GH 3 cells with a variety of secretagogues known to affect the regulated secretory pathway. In agreement with studies from other laboratories (37), we found no correlation between the biosynthetic rate of SRIF and its level of intracellular storage. However, this study and earlier data (16) revealed significant differences in both pro-SRIF processing and storage efficiency between GH 3 and the closely related GH4C1 cells (37) . In contrast to GH 4 cells, which processed pro-SRIF rather inefficiently and stored less than 10% of SRIF-immunoreactive material (37), GH 3 cells cleaved 70-75% of pro-SRIF and stored nearly 80% of the total SRIF material. The reasons for the differences in prohormone processing and sorting between these clonal cell lines are unclear at present.

Thus, if, for example, the GH pool was significantly larger than SRIF or it was turning over rapidly (relative to SRIF), then it might be argued that the previous pulse-chase data were related to the differential kinetics of the pools rather than to preferential storage of mature SRIF. Furthermore, in the earlier studies (16) the levels of pulse-labeled GH and SRIF were measured using different techniques, which, although permitting comparison of their processing and secretion kinetics, precluded determination of the synthetic rates or intracellular content. To address these issues the current studies employed RIAs to measure the level of total SRIF-related and GH-immunoreactive molecules. Most significantly, the RIA data and those obtained from pulse-labeling experiments gave quite similar results and demonstrated that substantially more GH than SRIF was secreted constitutively (65% vs. 20%). The pulse-labeling experiments showed that of the newly synthesized hormones, approximately 90% of GH and 45% SRIF were secreted constitutively. The slight differences between these two sets of data may be related to inherent discrepancies in the techniques for measuring these hormones (i.e. incomplete recovery of material, differential susceptibility of the hormones to proteolysis, and differences in the antibodies). Alternatively, they might be related to different kinetic pools of the hormones, i.e. it is possible that there is both a rapidly secreted pool and a long term storage pool, as suggested for other secretory proteins, such as in proinsulin and insulin (39) . Similar to results on the release of newly synthesized insulin from pancreatic B cells (39) , the majority of both the newly synthesized pulse-labeled SRIF and total SRIFimmunoreactive material was secreted via the regulated pathway. However, even if the constitutive secretion of pulse-labeled GH was explicable on the basis of a rapidly turning over pool, the data presented here demonstrate that the total endogenous GH (including a putative long term pool) is not stored as efficiently as the heterologously expressed SRIF. These data revealed that there was about a 4-fold variation in the level of SRIF expression in 15 clonal lines investigated. Most significantly, the intracellular storage of SRIFimmunoreactive material relative to that of GH was not correlated with the level of hormone expression. Thus, even in cells expressing one fourth the level of SRIF compared to GH, SRIF secretion was significantly enhanced by forskolin treatment, whereas the stimulation of GH was minimal. It will be important to determine the mechanism by which there is preferential targeting of SRIF to the regulated secretory pathway. Such a determination may provide new insight into the mechanism involved in prohormone processing and secretion.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 69, "end": 73, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2255, "end": 2259, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2353, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Rabbit anti-SRIF, suitable for use in RIAs, was a gift of Dr. Michael Berelowitz, State University of New York (Stony Brook, NY).
