In this study, an acetylation modification was identified at the K108 residue of the NS1 protein of H1N1 influenza virus. To further explore the function of the K108 acetylation modification of the NS1 protein, a deacetylation-mimic mutation (K108R) and a constant acetylation-mimic mutation (K108Q) were introduced into the NS1 protein in the background of A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (WSN), resulting in two mutant viruses (WSN-NS1-108R and WSN-NS1-108Q). In vitro and mouse studies showed that the deacetylation-mimic mutation K108R in the NS1 protein attenuated the replication and virulence of WSN-NS1-108R, while the constant acetylation-mimic mutant virus WSN-NS1-108Q showed similar replication and pathogenicity as the wild-type WSN virus (WSN-wt). The results indicated that acetylation at K108 of the NS1 protein has an important role in the replication and virulence of influenza virus. To further explore the potential mechanism, the type I interferon (IFN-I) antagonistic activity of the three NS1 proteins (NS1-108Q, NS1-108R, and NS1-wt) was compared in cells, which showed that the K108R mutation significantly attenuated the IFN-\u03b2 antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein compared with NS1-wt and NS1-108Q. Both NS1-wt and NS1-108Q inhibited the IFN-\u03b2 response activated by RIG-I CARD domain, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 more efficiently than the NS1-108R protein in cells. Taken together, the results indicated that acetylation at NS1 K108 is important for the IFN antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein and virulence of the influenza virus.",

The major role of the NS1 protein is inhibition of both interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated proteins by different mechanisms. NS1 inhibits the transcription of type I IFN by binding the 5\u2032 triphosphate viral double-stranded RNAs generated during viral replication to prevent the recognition of viral genomic material by host Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including RIG-I, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), and 2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L [2] [3] [4] . NS1 can also interact directly with RIG-I in the absence of RNA binding to inhibit the conformational change of RIG-I required for MAVS activation [5] . Moreover, NS1 is able to interrupt mRNA maturation by inhibiting the nuclear export of host mRNAs by binding to host poly(A)-binding protein II (PABPII) and cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 30 (CPSF30), which are required for host mRNA processing, resulting in the accumulation of IFN pre-mRNAs in the nucleus of infected cells [6] . In addition, NS1 also antagonizes the Open Access *Correspondence: lijinxiang@caas.cn; sunjhe@sjtu.edu.cn 1 Shanghai Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Key Laboratory of Urban Agriculture (South), Ministry of Agriculture, School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China 2 Chengdu National Agricultural Science and Technology Center, Sichuan, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article IFN signalling response by regulating other host factors, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, Crklike protein (CRKL), and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "The NS1 protein, typically 202-237 aa in length depending on the strain, contains four functional regions: an RNA binding domain (RBD, 1-73 aa), linker region (LR, 74-88 aa), effector domain (ED, 89-202 aa), and C-terminal \"tail\" (CTT, 207-237 aa) [12] . Multiple basic amino acids (e.g., 35R, 38R, 41K, and 46R) in the RBD are important for RNA binding activity and suppressing the activation of PKR [12, 13] . The ED plays an important role by targeting multiple host factors, such as PKR, CPSF30, and p85\u03b2 (PI3K), to inhibit antiviral responses and enhance viral replication [1] . The residue 187W in the ED domain is important for the dimerization of the NS1 protein, and the W187R substitution impaired NS1 dimerization and attenuated the virus in vivo [14] . In addition, residues 186E, 189D, and 194V play important roles in the binding of NS1 to cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30), and mutations in those residues weaken the binding of NS1 to CPSF30 and impair the ability of the NS1 protein to shut off host gene expression [15, 16] .",

            "text": "Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and acetylation, are important for protein function. Phosphorylation at 49T, 80T, and 215T of the NS1 protein are important for interferon antagonistic activity and replication of human influenza virus [17, 18] . SUMOylation at positions 219 and 221 of NS1 are crucial for host protein expression shutoff and replication of H5N1 influenza virus [19] . Acetylation is an important post-translational modification that occurs in two forms [20] . One is the co/post-translational acetylation at the N \u03b1 -termini of the nascent polypeptide chains [21] . The other form is acetylation of the \u03b5-amino group of lysine, which was first recognized in histones regulating gene translation [22] and later was found in non-histone proteins [23] . The acetylation status is reversible and well balanced by lysine (K) acetyltransferases (KATs) and lysine deacetylases (KDACs), which are tightly regulated to perform many cellular functions [24] . Dysfunction of the acetylation machinery can inhibit protein functions and consequently lead to severe diseases [25, 26] . Acetylation has been found in multiple proteins of influenza viruses. Acetylation was identified in the NP protein of influenza virus, and deacetylation of the NP protein prevented the virus from assembling functional virus particles [27] . A histone-like sequence (histone mimic) was identified in the NS1 protein of influenza A H3N2, which contributes to suppression of the antiviral response [28] . The N-terminal acetylation of PA-X is required for the host shutoff activity of PA-X and for viral polymerase activity [29, 30] . Acetylation of PA has been reported to be crucial for polymerase activity, and deacetylated PA protein restricts IAV RNA transcription and replication. The influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) has three conserved cysteine residues (551, 559, and 562) at its C terminus serving as acylation sites that are essential for the formation of fusion pores and infectivity [31] .",

To further explore whether K108 is subtype-specific, we compared the NS1 amino acid sequences of 1000 randomly selected influenza virus strains of each endemic subtype in birds and humans from GenBank. Most avian H9N2 (100%), H5N1 (99.9%), H7N9 (100%), human H3N2 (99.4%), and human H1N1 (99.9%, isolated before 2009) viruses contained K108 in the NS1 genes, whereas 99.9% of 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses contained 108R in the NS1 protein. These data demonstrated that the K108 residue is relatively conserved in influenza viruses except the 2009 pandemic H1N1. Since the NS1 protein is an important virulence marker and antagonist of host innate immunity, we chose to further explore the influence of acetylated K108 on virus replication and virulence in this study. To mimic deacetylated lysine, a K108R substitution was introduced into the NS1 protein, since an R substitution prevents acetylation but preserves the positive charge, and a mutant virus containing the NS1-K108R substitution was generated in the background of WSN virus (WSN-NS1-108R). Moreover, to mimic constantly acetylated lysine at K108 of the NS1 protein, a K108Q substitution that is a known acetylation mimic was introduced into NS1, resulting in a mutant virus containing NS1-K108Q (WSN-NS1-108Q).",

At the late stage of infection (36 hpi), the NS1 protein was mainly located in the nucleus and perinuclear area of infected cells (Figure 5C ). The NS1-108Q protein was located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm at 12 hpi and 24 hpi, while it was mainly located in the perinuclear area of infected cells at 36 hpi. In contrast, the NS1-108R protein accumulated mostly in the cytoplasm during the whole infection course.

Recent studies have shown that posttranslational modifications of viral proteins modulate the virus life cycle, e.g., phosphorylation of influenza viral proteins (NS1, M1, and NP) plays important roles in virus replication [35] [36] [37] [38] . The ubiquitination of NP and M2 proteins is crucial for viral RNA replication and the production of infectious virus particles [37] . Acetylation is an important post-translational modification in eukaryotes, but the occurrence and function of acetylation in influenza viral proteins remain largely unclear. Giese et al. reported that acetylation of 77 K, 113 K, and 229 K of NP proteins is important for virus polymerase activity and replication [27] . In the present study, we identified and characterized the acetylation of K108 in the NS1 protein, and the deacetylation of K108Q affected viral replication in cells at 36 and 48 hpi. The expression levels of NS1-K108Q and NS1-K108R in transfected 293T cells were similar ( Figure 4E ), while the NS1 levels in infected MDCK and A549 cells were different ( Figures 2C and D) . This result could be attributed to the deacetylation affecting virus replication, which resulted in low expression of NS1 in infected cells. Moreover, the acetylation of 108Q contributes to the IFN antagonistic ability of the NS1 protein.",

The NS1 protein of influenza virus is a virulence factor that inhibits the antiviral immunity of the infected host, and C-terminal truncation has been widely used as a strategy to generate attenuated virus vaccine candidates [39] . One mechanism used by NS1 to inhibit the IFN response is through direct binding and sequestration of RNA as well as direct interaction with TRIM25 and complex formation with the RNA sensor RIG-I, resulting in inhibition of the activation of the RIG-I CARD and hence inhibition of IRF3 activation [12] . The RNA binding, RIG-I and TRIM25 interacting domains are located in the N-terminus (1-73 aa) of the NS1 protein. However, the acetylated K108 is located in the ED domain, and acetylation of K108 may not affect the RNA binding capability of the NS1 protein. The NS1-K108R substitution impaired the suppression of IFN promoter activation by poly(I:C), RIG-1 CARD, TBK-1, and IRF3, which suggested that the NS1-K108R substitution affected the IFN antagonism of NS1 either through targeting downstream of IRF3 or a general mechanism that NS1 uses to inhibit IFN, such as interaction with CPSF30, resulting in inhibition of the processing of mRNA, including IFN mRNA [6] . Notably, the CPSF30 protein is mainly located in the nucleus and is required for the 3\u2032 end processing of all host pre-mRNAs. Interestingly, the deacetylation-mimic K108R substitution retained NS1 protein in the cytoplasm of infected cells, resulting in a possible impaired interaction between CPSF30 and the NS1 protein, subsequently leading to attenuated IFN antagonism. Benjamin Hale and colleagues found that the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) virus has 108R in NS1, and NS1 was unable to suppress general host gene expression. Nevertheless, the RK108 substitution in the NS1/2009 protein restored its ability to block general gene expression and bind CPSF30 [40] . This could explain why attenuation of the IFN antagonistic ability of NS1-K108R is independent of RIG-I CARD, TBK-1, and IRF3 activation. In addition, Anastasina et al. [41] reported that the NS1 protein binds to cellular DNA to block the cellular transcription of IFNs and ISGs; thus, NS1 proteins retained in the cytoplasm lose their cellular DNA binding function, resulting in impaired IFN-\u03b2 antagonistic ability.",
