As a follow-up to that we have karyotyped a selected series of children whose clinical features strongly suggested Prader-Willi syndrome using both good quality Giemsa banding and high-resolution banding techniques. Meanwhile, Ledbetter et a/. (1981) made a preliminary report of four children with typical Prader-Willi syndrome and a small interstitial deletion of chromosome 15, with break points at 15qll and 15q13, so that the 15q12 band is deleted. More recently they have reported a larger series with the syndrome, in which this deletion was found in 19 of the 40 patients examined (Ledbetter et a/. 1982).",

There was no clinical distinction between cases with and without the chromosome anomaly. Examination of three parents and a group of controls showed that the proximal end of the long arm of chromosome 15 may have a considerable degree of normal variation, which can make interpretation difficult.",
