Here, we determined the roles of NFjB activation in aldosterone-induced kidney injury. Methods We used unilaterally nephrectomized rats with or without continuous aldosterone infusion and 0.9% saline as drinking water for 3 weeks. IMD-1041, an IKKb inhibitor, and spironolactone were orally administered to inhibit NFjB and mineralocorticoid receptor, respectively. Results The aldosterone-infused rats exhibited severe kidney injury, hypertension, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic proteins, osteopontin, fibrinogen, collagen type I, and PAI-1. Western blotting confirmed NFjB activation by aldosterone by the increased amount of p65 in the nuclear fraction of the kidney, and oral IMD-1041 prevented the kidney injury and lessened the increase in pro-inflammatory and fibrotic proteins without significant changes in blood pressures. In addition, changes in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been found to act as a protective factor in various kidney injury models, were examined. Immunofluorescence studies revealed the presence of ACE2 in the brush-border membrane of the proximal convoluted tubules and markedly blunted ACE2 staining in aldosteroneinfused rats. The decrease in amount of ACE2 protein was confirmed by Western blotting, and IMD-1041 also prevented the decrease in ACE2. The administration of spironolactone also abolished the effects of aldosterone. Conclusion Our results suggest that aldosterone induces kidney injury via activation of NFjB and mineralocorticoid receptor, and that decreased ACE2 expression may play an important role in aldosterone-induced kidney injury.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Aldosterone is known to exert both classical and nonclassical actions. The classical actions on the kidney are mainly observed in collecting duct cells, where it induces potassium secretion and sodium reabsorption. Aldosterone's non-classical actions cause tissue injury in various organs, including the heart, arteries, and kidney [1] . Both the classical and the non-classical actions of aldosterone are mediated by a specific mineralocorticoid receptor and are inhibited by its antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone. In collecting duct cells, it has been reported that nuclear factor jB (NFjB), which plays pivotal roles in inflammation mediated by various cytokines, is activated by aldosterone and that its activation plays a key role in the regulation of electrolyte transporters in collecting duct cells [2, 3] . It has also been reported that NFjB is activated in cardiomyocytes [4] and cultured mesangial cells [5] and mediates the pro-inflammatory and fibrotic actions of aldosterone. It has been suggested that aldosterone activates AP-1 as well as NFjB in cultured renal fibroblasts [6] and induces osteopontin expression, which in turn increases expression of collagen types 1, 3, and 5. In contrast to the findings in these studies, aldosterone has been found to prevent NFjB-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a production in neutrophils [7] , suggesting that the relationship between aldosterone and NFjB activation may vary with the tissue and cell type. In the present study we investigated whether the pro-inflammatory actions and fibrotic actions of aldosterone are mediated by NFjB activation in in-vivo experiments, and changes in expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is known to act as protective factor in various kidney injuries, were also determined in the aldosterone-infused rats.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 332, "end": 335, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 816, "end": 819, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 820, "end": 822, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 892, "end": 895, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 925, "end": 928, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1103, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1362, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Male Wistar rats (6-7 weeks of age) were used in this study, and all experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committees of Keio University School of Medicine.

Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SE Following aldosterone infusion and high salt intake, the amount of p65 protein which moves from the cytosolic fraction to the nucleus by NFjB activation was clearly increased in the nuclear fraction of the kidney.

The results also clearly showed that systemic NFjB inhibition prevented kidney injury by aldosterone, and that ACE2 expression is down-regulated by the NFjB pathway in this kidney injury model. NFjB is known to play a pivotal role as a signal transduction system of various cytokines [13] . In diabetic and various renal injuries, it has been reported that NFjB activation was observed not only in experimental animals [14, 15] but also in patients with kidney diseases [16] . In addition, our previous study [10] clearly showed that albumin-overload-induced tissue injury is mediated by NFjB activation.

In cultured renal fibroblasts [6] and freshly isolated cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells [2, 3] , aldosterone was shown to activate the NFjB pathway, whereas it was found to directly antagonize the action of interleukin (IL)-8 and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF)induced NFjB activation in neutrophils [7] , and also induced NFjB activation in cultured mesangial cells [5] . Consistent with the results of these in-vitro experiments, the results of the present study showed that aldosterone activates NFjB and that systemic inhibition of NFjB by a specific inhibitor, IMD-1041, mitigated the kidney injury and the increase in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines under in-vivo conditions, although the effects of IMD-1041 were partial in these changes of mRNA expression, probably due to at least two mechanisms. The effects of aldosterone are known to be mediated by the AP-1 pathway as well as by NFjB activation [6] , and presumably the AP-1 pathway was still active and capable of inducing tissue injury in our experiment. The other possibility for the limited effects of IMD-1041 is that hypertension remained unchanged. The blood pressure levels of the aldosterone-infused rats were not significantly changed by IMD-1041, and high blood pressure could induce kidney injury and changes in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines. Despite this limitation, the NFjB inhibitor IMD-1041 may be a good candidate drug for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and various kidney diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1189, "end": 1193, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1328, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1332, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1379, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1418, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2793, "end": 2796, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2858, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2859, "end": 2861, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3080, "end": 3083, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3147, "end": 3150, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3715, "end": 3718, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 107, "end": 113, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1606, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1879, "end": 1885, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2224, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results of the present study confirmed that proinflammatory and fibrotic cytokines and proteins, osteopontin, fibronectin, PAI-1, and collagen type I, are up-regulated by aldosterone in rats, the same as reported previously in aldosterone-infused mice [17] , and the data in our study showed that these effects of aldosterone were exerted via NFjB activation.

ACE2 has recently been cloned, and its physiological and pathophysiological roles have been characterized in the lung, kidney, and cardiovascular system [23] . In addition to its role as receptor protein for the SARS virus, ACE2 acts as a protective factor against tissue injury by angiotensin II. Indeed, changes in ACE2 expression and activity have been reported in various kidney injury models. ACE2 expression in the tubules of rats with streptozotocininduced diabetes has been found to be decreased [21] , and kidney biopsy specimens from diabetic patients have shown decreased expression of tubular and glomerular ACE2 [24] . Spontaneously hypertensive rats also show decreased tubular ACE2 expression when they develop hypertension, whereas glomerular expression of ACE2 increased after birth and after the development of hypertension [19] . Our previous study revealed that protein overload induced a decrease in ACE2 expression via NFjB activation [11] . ACE2 expression in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was significantly decreased by aldosterone, and the specific mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitor eplerenone completely abolished this effect of aldosterone [25] , consistent with the results of the present study in the kidney. Furthermore, the results of the present study clearly showed that the decrease in ACE2 protein expression by aldosterone was mitigated by NFjB inhibition. Combining our previous results [11] and the present data, it was suggested that ACE2 expression was down-regulated by NFjB activation. It is possible, however, that the down-regulation of ACE2 by NFjB in this study was induced by the indirect effect of systemic inhibition of NFjB, since IMD-1041 was orally administered. In addition, it was not determined which cells in the kidney were involved in the effects of IMD-1041, for the same reason. Previous reports on tissue injury by aldosterone have clearly shown that inflammation plays important roles in the remodeling of the heart, vasculature, and kidney [26, 27] . Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that aldosterone receptors are present in various types of cells, including endothelial cells, macrophages, vascular smooth cells, cardiac cells, and renal tubular and glomerular cells, and that activation of the aldosterone receptor on these cells could induce inflammation in the organs [26, 27] . Therefore, it is possible that NFkB was activated by aldosterone and induced inflammation not only in tubular and mesangial cells but also in various intrarenal and extrarenal cells, such as macrophages and endothelial cells, and that the beneficial effects of IMD-1041 treatment, amelioration of kidney injury and the increase in ACE2, were exerted by inhibition of NFkB activity in all of these cell types. On the other hand, in this present study, we did not examine the entire intrarenal renin-angiotensin system, which includes local renin production, ACE activity, and angiotensin metabolism. The determination of the changes in the intrarenal reninangiotensin system should shed light on the exact role of ACE2 in aldosterone-induced kidney injury and should be performed in future studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 462, "end": 466, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 813, "end": 817, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 934, "end": 938, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1155, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1270, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1490, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1743, "end": 1747, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2326, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2327, "end": 2330, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2662, "end": 2666, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2667, "end": 2670, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the results of this study showed that aldosterone activates NFjB in the kidney and that ACE2 is down-regulated by aldosterone.
