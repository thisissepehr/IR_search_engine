Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant literature in which clinical outcomes of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were described. Published studies (between 01/01/2009 and 05/07/2012) describing cases of fatal or hospitalised A(H1N1)pdm09 and including data on bacterial testing or co-infection. Results: Seventy five studies met the inclusion criteria. Fatal cases with autopsy specimen testing were reported in 11 studies, in which any co-infection was identified in 23% of cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae 29%). Eleven studies reported bacterial co-infection among hospitalised cases of A(H1N1)2009pdm with confirmed pneumonia, with a mean of 19% positive for bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae 54%). Of 16 studies of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, bacterial co-infection identified in a mean of 19% of cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae 26%). The mean prevalence of bacterial co-infection was 12% in studies of hospitalised patients not requiring ICU (Streptococcus pneumoniae 33%) and 16% in studies of paediatric patients hospitalised in general or pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) wards (Streptococcus pneumoniae 16%). Conclusion: We found that few studies of the 2009 influenza pandemic reported on bacterial complications and testing. Of studies which did report on this, secondary bacterial infection was identified in almost one in four patients, with Streptococcus pneumoniae the most common bacteria identified. Bacterial complications were associated with serious outcomes such as death and admission to intensive care. Prevention and treatment of bacterial secondary infection should be an integral part of pandemic planning, and improved uptake of routine pneumococcal vaccination in adults with an indication may reduce the impact of a pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Influenza pandemics cause morbidity and mortality from both direct viral effects, which tend to present early (within the first few days), and secondary bacterial complications, which tend to present later (after the first week). Evidence of influenza predisposing to bacterial co-infection is seen in seasonal influenza epidemics, past pandemics, pathology studies and animal models [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Infection with influenza disrupts the respiratory tract by direct pathogenic effects, which then predisposes to bacterial secondary infection. Conversely, bacterial pathogens in the respiratory tract may also predispose to influenza and other viral infection [9] . During the 1918 pandemic, bacterial pneumonia was a major cause of morbidity and mortality, as shown by studies at the time as well as retrospective study of pathology specimens [10, 11] . At that time, antibiotics were not widely available as they are now, and it is thought that the high observed mortality rate was partially due to the inability to treat secondary bacterial sepsis. The most important bacterial co-infections during an influenza pandemic S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and group A Streptococcus (1, 4) . However, two early reviews of severe cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) showed no evidence of bacterial pneumonia among 30 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed cases in California (5) and 10 intensive-care patients in Michigan (6) .
