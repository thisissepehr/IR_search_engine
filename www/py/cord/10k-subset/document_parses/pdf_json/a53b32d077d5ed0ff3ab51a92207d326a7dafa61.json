In late 2009, a 16-year-old woman, and 2 weeks later, a 12-year-old boy were admitted to our hospital for pulmonary syndrome associated with high fever. The clinical presentation was similar for both patients: asthaenia, high fever, cough, rhinorrhea and dyspnoea, but no thoracic pain. The two patients needed oxygen therapy. Chest X-rays of both patients showed bilateral interstitial syndrome and right basal condensation. Computed tomography (CT) scans confirmed the bilateral alveolar condensation syndrome with an air bronchogram, ground glass opacities and numerous fuzzy nodules (Fig. 1) . The two CT scans revealed multiple mediastinal adenopathies and a large thymus. The H1N1 flu virus was suspected because of the epidemic in the winter of 2009. The diagnosis was confirmed by real-time PCR using the H1SWL test (M-CNR Pasteur gene) with the LightCycler 2.0 (Roche) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the girl and nasal liquid from the boy. Due to the high fever and neutropaenia, the patients were immediately treated with antibiotics and cefotaxime (ciprofloxacine and cefotaxime for the girl; cefotaxime, josamycin and amikacin for the boy), but with little success. After the diagnosis of H1N1 flu infection, we used oseltamivir at the recommended dose of 75 mg per day (from day 3 for the first patient and day 1 for the boy). The symptoms disappeared a few days after beginning the oral treatment, and oxygen was no longer needed. Oseltamivir treatment was stopped after 5 days.",

The first sign of T-ALL was the presence of an H1N1 flu virus pulmonary infection, which was observed during the winter, pandemic of this virus. The association between lymphopaenia and the H1N1 flu virus has been previously shown, with a higher mortality in the patients with low count. No secondary infections were observed, and neither patient experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), perhaps due to the neutropaenia, despite the fact that previously reported deaths were mostly due to ARDS [2, 3] . The only recommended treatment for the H1N1 virus is oseltamivir, and this treatment is highly effective [4] [5] [6] [7] . We confirmed the efficacy in immunocompromised patients. In these two cases, the occurrence of the H1N1 flu virus did not result in modification of the treatment, nor the results of the chemotherapy as the two patients were alive 7 months after the diagnosis and in complete haematological remission. These cases suggest that H1N1 virus infections could be masking other conditions in immunocompromised patients, and they confirm that oseltamivir is effective in these patients. ",
