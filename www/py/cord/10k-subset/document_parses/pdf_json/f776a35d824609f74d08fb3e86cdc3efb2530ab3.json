For three viral infections in which autophagy constituents are proviral (poliovirus, dengue, and Zika), we developed a panel of knockouts (KOs) of autophagyrelated genes to test which components of the canonical pathway are utilized. We discovered that each virus uses a distinct set of initiation components; however, all three viruses utilize autophagy-related gene 9 (ATG9), a lipid scavenging protein, and LC3 (light-chain 3), which is involved in membrane curvature. These results show that viruses use noncanonical routes for membrane sculpting and LC3 recruitment. By measuring viral RNA abundance, we also found that poliovirus utilizes these autophagy components for intracellular growth, while dengue and Zika virus only use autophagy components for post-RNA replication processes. Comparing how RNA viruses manipulate the autophagy pathway reveals new noncanonical autophagy routes, explains the exacerbation of disease by starvation, and uncovers common targets for antiviral drugs.",

Many of these cellular pathways provide good targets for antiviral drugs, as they are less likely to develop resistance since they are encoded in the host and not the fast-evolving viral genome. The autophagy pathway is an important stress response pathway that allows cells to recycle cellular components for energy conservation by sequestering cytoplasmic molecules and organelles in double-membraned vesicles (DMVs) and by degrading the contents into reusable elements. Many RNA viruses induce this pathway to provide membrane surfaces for replication and as a source of vesicles for maturation and exit from cells. We developed a panel of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) knockout (KO) human cells lacking individual components of the autophagy pathway to assess what aspects of the pathway diverse RNA viruses utilized.",

The autophagy pathway is a highly conserved cellular response that is induced upon nutrient deprivation, other stresses, and developmental cues. Canonical autophagy (\"self-eating\") proceeds through a series of distinct steps that nucleate and expand membranous structures, termed autophagosomes, that enclose cytoplasmic contents [1] (Fig 1A) . The resulting double-membraned vesicles (DMVs) then fuse with lysosomes, in which hydrolases promote degradation of the cytoplasmic contents for reuse by the cell. The autophagy pathway utilizes large amount of lipids to accomplish the formation of autophagosomes. The origins of these membranes are debated but are likely to derive both from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipids scavenged from a variety of membranes throughout the cell [2-6].",

            "text": "There are over 30 autophagy-related genes (ATGs) that were first identified in yeast, most of which have mammalian homologs [1] . Autophagy gene products take part in several distinct complexes (Fig 1A) . In human cells, the specific kinase activity of the complex that contains Unc-like autophagy-activating kinase (ULK1), PTK2/FAK family interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200), ATG13, and ATG101 complex is normally repressed by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) under basal conditions. Upon mTOR activation, ULK1/FIP200/ATG101 is activated, thus activating the downstream autophagy pathway [7] . mTOR repression of the ULK1 complex activity can be bypassed by another kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Thus, ULK1 activation can be achieved by two different routes of autophagy induction [8] . This complex is essential for the downstream formation of autophagosomes via the kinase activity of ULK1 [9] . The VPS34/ beclin-1(BECN1)/ATG14L complex, also essential for the initiation and maturation of autophagosomes, relies on ULK1 kinase activity, with BECN1 serving as a direct substrate [10] . The kinase activity of VPS34 is in turn required for the production of phosphatidylinositol lipids needed to recruit downstream autophagy proteins [11, 12] . The activation of ATG9, the only known intrinsically membrane-bound protein in the pathway, also requires ULK1. ATG9 is important for scavenging lipids from various sites throughout the cell and trafficking them back to growing autophagosomes [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . These events lead to ATG5-mediated covalent attachment of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to light-chain 3 (LC3) [18], the most characteristic component of immature and mature autophagosomes. Membrane-associated LC3 is needed for recruitment of cargo, stabilization of negative curvature, closure of the autophagosome, and fusion with lysosomes [19] [20] [21] [22] . While each of these proteins is considered essential for the canonical autophagy pathway, several instances of mammalian autophagy that lack one or more of these components have been reported, including ULK1-independent, BECN1-independent, and ATG5-independent formation of DMVs and degradation of cytoplasmic contents [23] [24] [25] . Such processes are termed \"noncanonical\" autophagy. This also includes secretory autophagy, in which cytoplasmic components are released undegraded into the extracellular milieu [26] .

Antiviral activities of autophagy include xenophagy, in which intracellular viruses are targeted for degradation as well as the triggering and facilitation of immune responses [27] . As a testament to the power of autophagy as an arm of innate immunity, many successful viruses such as herpesviruses [28] , Sindbis virus [29] , and vesicular stomatitis virus [30] have evolved strategies to block the induction of the autophagy pathway. On the other hand, utilization of components of the autophagy pathway by many viruses serves proviral functions. The unique ability of the autophagy pathway to generate membranous structures de novo and to allow or disallow their acidification may be desirable features for any virus that survives by manipulating intracellular membranes. All positive-strand RNA viruses associate with cytoplasmic membranes to replicate their genomes. Virally associated membranes come from a variety of cellular compartments, including ER, Golgi, mitochondria, and lysosomes [31] [32] [33] [34] . Many viral proteins are membrane-bound, and RNA amplification occurs on the topologically cytoplasmic surfaces of vesicles. Viruses such as dengue, for instance, induce ER-membrane invaginations to form isolated pockets in which viral proteins congregate for RNA replication outside the reach of cellular antiviral factors.",

This does not take into account the potential utilization of noncanonical autophagy pathways or gain-of-function effects of drugs [50] . We found that PV, DENV, and ZIKV all utilize multiple components of the autophagy pathway while bypassing others and that each virus uses a unique set of initiation components. A common feature is that all of the tested viruses require the LC3 protein but bypass its canonical cellular lipidation process, using other means to recruit LC3 to virally induced membranes.

To test whether canonical autophagy was inactivated in these KO cell lines, the accumulation of p62/SQSTM (p62), which is degraded in wild-type (WT) cells via constitutive autophagy, was monitored ( Fig 1B) . Accumulated p62 was present at low abundance in the parental HeLa cells (WT) and increased in cells treated with chloroquine (CQ) to prevent the formation of autolysosomes and thus the degradation of autophagosomal contents. All KO cell lines showed enhanced constitutive p62 accumulation, whether or not they were treated with CQ, indicating that the canonical basal autophagy pathway was successfully inhibited (Fig 1B) . Additionally, to confirm that the canonical, starvation-induced autophagy pathway was obstructed in all of the KO cell lines, we quantified the presence of endogenous LC3 puncta upon starvation.

PV is a nonenveloped virus that matures intracellularly. The intracellular amplification of PV in WT and KO cell lines was monitored in a single infectious cycle, which comprises cell entry, translation, RNA replication, and packaging but not cell-to-cell spread. As shown in Fig 1C, cells ablated for ULK1, FIP200, ATG9, and LC3B had significant viral growth defects at this time point. However, viral titers in cells ablated for BECN1, VPS34, and ATG5 were indistinguishable from WT. More detailed time courses of a single PV infectious cycle confirmed the reduction in virus yield in \u0394ULK1, \u0394FIP200, \u0394ATG9, and \u0394LC3 cells (Fig 1C) . The fact that ATG5 is not required is particularly curious, given that viral growth was drastically reduced in the \u0394LC3B line ( Fig 1C) . These observations argue that the virus still utilizes the LC3 protein, though perhaps not its lipidated form. We confirmed that adding back autophagy components to our KO cell lines restored viral titers to WT levels for ULK1 and FIP200 (S2A Fig). Additionally, adding back a kinase dead ULK1 mutant (K46I) reduced viral yield in WT cells, consistent with its previously reported dominant negative effects on the autophagy pathway [51] . ULK1-K46I also failed to rescue the viral defect in ULK1 KO cells (S2A Fig) .",

We monitored a single cycle of DENV growth by quantifying the release of infectious virus into the extracellular medium. All CRISPR-Cas9 KO cells were infected with DENV for a single 24-hour replication cycle at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Fig 1D) . We found that DENV does not require the same initiation complex as PV, as viral titers were unaffected in \u0394ULK1 cells. We additionally tested whether a double knock down of ULK1 and ULK2 affected DENV growth, given that ULK1 and ULK2 can be redundant in some cell types [9, 52] . We saw no defect in DENV titers when small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against ULK2 were used in the \u0394ULK1 cell line or when ULK1 and ULK2 siRNAs were used in the \u0394FIP200 cell line (S2B Fig), suggesting that DENV does not require this complex. Similar to PV, DENV titers were reduced in \u0394ATG9 cells, perhaps highlighting a common need for lipid scavenging in HeLa cells. DENV utilized VPS34 but not BECN1, both part of the same complex, arguing that DENV might specifically require VPS34 but not the rest of the complex. Additionally, adding back VPS34 to the \u0394VPS34 cell line restored DENV titers to WT levels (S2C Fig) . Downstream in the autophagy pathway, DENV utilized LC3 but not ATG5, similarly to PV.",

Recently, we showed that induction of the autophagy pathway by starvation led to an enhancement of PV amplification that was dependent on the canonical pathway, as \u0394ATG5 and \u0394BECN1 cell lines failed to show enhanced viral infection upon starvation [53] . To test whether in vivo PV infection is also enhanced by starvation as well as whether this exacerbation depends on the canonical autophagy pathway, we bred C57BL/6 mice that were homozygous for a transgene expressing the poliovirus receptor (PVR) [54] as well as the Atg5 gene flanked by Lox sites, the targets of Cre recombinase. These mice were bred either to express or not express Cre recombinase under the control of a tamoxifen-inducible promoter [55] . The conditional deletion of floxed Atg5 upon tamoxifen treatment was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of a DNA junction expected to be generated during the Cre-mediated excision (S2D Fig). The decrease of Atg5 function in the Cre-expressing mice was confirmed at the protein level by the large increase in abundance of LC3-I, which normally would be converted to LC3-II by Atg5 (S2E Fig) . Although a small amount of residual LC3-II remained in the Creexpressing mice, this is typical of the nonabsolute nature of \"floxed\" gene removal by Cre recombinase [55] . Mice were fasted for 48 hours before intramuscular infection with PV. Fasted mice showed increased PV titers in mice with an intact Atg5 gene ( Fig 1E) . However, in the absence of Atg5, the enhanced viral titer seen with fasting was not observed (Fig 1E) . Additionally, we treated mice with loperamide to induce the autophagy pathway by a different mechanism [56, 57] and found a similar response of enhanced viral titers in WT mice treated with the drug but no difference between untreated and drug-treated mice lacking Atg5 ( Fig  1F) . These data argue that the exacerbation of viral infection by starvation or loperamideinduced autophagy requires ATG5 and most likely the canonical pathway, even though poliovirus growth per se uses only portions of this pathway. We speculate that preinduction of the canonical autophagy pathway increases the concentrations of proteins or lipids that facilitate subsequent viral infection.",

On the other hand, DENV-infected cells lacking an intact autophagy pathway synthesize viral RNA, but virion maturation is defective [46] . To distinguish between amplification in the first round of infection and subsequent spread, intracellular RNA accumulation was monitored by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at early and late time points (Fig 2A) . Even in the first cycle of PV infection in the KO cell lines, the decline in RNA accumulation was significant in \u0394ULK1, \u0394FIP200, \u0394ATG9, and \u0394LC3 cells, and this effect continued upon subsequent rounds (Fig 2B) . To test whether viral entry was affected in the KO cell lines, we performed an entry assay. Virus was allowed to infect cells for 30 minutes, after which virions that had not entered were stripped from the cell surface with an acid wash. RT-qPCR analysis of PV RNA that successfully entered the cell showed no difference between WT and KO cell lines To determine whether autophagy components influence DENV translation and RNA synthesis, viral packaging and spread, or both, viral RNA synthesis was monitored after single (24 hpi [hours post infection]) and multiple (48 hpi) rounds of infection. In the absence of ATG9, VPS34, or LC3, no reduction in DENV RNA was observed in the first cycle (Fig 2B) , even though the production of infectious virus was significantly reduced at this time point (Fig 1D) . This is consistent with previous observations that in the presence of autophagy inhibitor spautin-1, packaged virions were defective but RNA accumulation was not [46] . Upon additional rounds of infection, the accumulation of DENV viral RNA was greatly reduced (Fig 2B) , consistent with the poor infectivity of virions from the first round. In accordance with these data, we observed similar amounts of viral protein accumulation at early time points in WT and \u0394ATG9 cells but reduced accumulation at later time points (S3E Fig). We conclude that in the absence of a noncanonical autophagy pathway, initial DENV translation and RNA synthesis are not affected, but infection of subsequent rounds is greatly reduced as a result of defective assembly, maturation, or egress.",

However, after additional infectious cycles, both RNA ( Fig 2B) and virus production ( Fig 2C) were greatly reduced. These data argue that for ZIKV, like DENV, autophagy components are only necessary for a postreplication process such as packaging or particle maturation. However, unlike either PV or DENV, the accumulation of infectious ZIKV was reduced in the entire CRISPR-Cas9 KO panel except the \u0394ATG5 line ( Fig 2C) . This argues that ZIKV utilizes both upstream initiation complexes ULK1/FIP200 and BECN1/VPS34, perhaps feeding into many aspects of the canonical autophagy pathway.

The low background for these probes from uninfected cells was validated in WT HeLa cells by confocal microscopy (Fig 2D) . These probes were then used to determine the percentage of cells positive for viral RNA by flow cytometry, using a low MOI (0.1 plaque forming units [PFU]/cell) and multiple cycles of infection.

Other viruses have been shown previously to activate the autophagy pathway via AMPK activation [62] . The differential utilization of upstream autophagy components by PV, DENV, and ZIKV could result from the activation of different upstream signaling cascades. To test this possibility, we looked at the phosphorylation status of S6K, which is phosphorylated when mTOR is active and autophagy is repressed [63] . We saw that while rapamycin treatment led to the loss of S6K phosphorylation, PV, DENV, and ZIKV infection did not alter its phosphorylation status ( Fig 3A) . This suggests that the activation of autophagy during viral infection is independent of mTOR inactivation and thus, by definition, noncanonical. We next looked at AMPK phosphorylation status and discovered that PV and ZIKV led to AMPK phosphorylation and thus activation but not DENV ( Fig 3B) . Since AMPK is known to directly activate ULK1, these data support the idea that PV and ZIKV utilize the ULK1 complex in activating the autophagy pathway, while DENV bypasses both mTOR and AMPK, perhaps avoiding ULK1 activation entirely.",

WT, \u0394ULK1, and \u0394ATG9 cells were infected with PV at a high MOI (10 PFU/cell) for 6 hours, followed by high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution to preserve membrane structures. Images were visualized by electron microscopy (EM) (Fig 4A) . PV-infected WT cells showed the characteristic DMVs shown previously to be induced either by infection or coexpression of PV proteins 2BC and 3A [34, 35] . These DMV structures were not present when cells were treated with guanidine, a potent inhibitor of viral replication (Fig 4A and 4B ). In \u0394ULK1 and \u0394ATG9 cells, qualitatively different membrane rearrangements were observed. Infection of \u0394ULK1 cells led to an increase in single-membraned vesicles, while infection of \u0394ATG9 cells led to an increased number of electron dense single-membraned vesicles, both of which diminished when cells were treated with guanidine ( Fig 4A and 4B ). Single-membraned vesicles can be the precursors of DMVs in canonical autophagy; this may also be the case in PV-infected cells [66] . Therefore, the single-membraned vesicles observed in \u0394ULK1 and \u0394ATG9 cells could represent precursors or off-pathway structures that accumulate during arrest of the functions of the ULK1 complex. The presence of such precursors could also be increased by the lower viral protein abundance in these KO cell lines (S3B Fig). No alterations in membrane structures were seen in any cells in the presence of guanidine, arguing that translation from input RNA is not sufficient to induce these changes.",

The fact that very few GFP-LC3-G120A puncta were observed in WT cells might indicate that the virus preferentially induces puncta formation with lipidated LC3, which is still present as untagged endogenous LC3. However, GFP-LC3-G120A puncta formation was observed in \u0394ATG5 cells upon infection with PV, DENV, or ZIKV (Fig 5B and 5C ). These results suggest that all three viruses can either recruit unlipidated LC3 to membranes or can lead to lipidation of LC3 independently of ATG5.",

Cells were treated with rapamycin, CQ, or infected with PV. As expected, no LC3-II was observed in \u0394ATG5 cells, and treatment with CQ increased LC3-II abundance in WT but not \u0394ATG5 cells when whole-cell lysates were tested ( Fig 5D) . Proteins most tightly associated with membranes can be enriched by treatment of extracts with saponin [70] . LC3-I was retained in the membrane fraction in PV-infected cells in both WT and \u0394ATG5 cells (Fig 5D) . Thus, PV is capable of recruiting LC3-I to membranes in the absence of lipidation and the canonical lipidation machinery. In agreement with the above data, we observed by EM that PV infection still leads to the formation of DMVs in \u0394ATG5 cells (Fig 5E and 5F ) and that these structures are dependent on active viral replication since they are absent in cells treated with guanidine. However, no DMVs were seen upon PV infection of \u0394LC3B cells, but an increase in singlemembraned vesicles was observed. Therefore, PV is capable of forming DMVs without lipidated LC3 but still appears to require the LC3 protein itself. Interestingly, PV infection of \u0394ATG5 cells resulted in the formation of many large vesicles that resemble multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Fig 5E and 5F ). These might represent an altered curvature capacity of unlipidated LC3 alone [22] , as compared to the increased curvature in PV-infected WT cells, which contain both LC3-I and LC3-II ( Fig 5D) .",

            "text": "To determine how PV leads to recruitment of unlipidated LC3 to membranes, we used an anti-GFP antibody to capture GFP-LC3 and tightly associated, detergent-resistant proteins during infection. Mass spectrometry (MS) was then used to identify the co-immunoprecipitated (IP) proteins. To confirm that our GFP-LC3 IP was specific, we compared several cellular proteins known to interact with both LC3-I and LC3-II or only with LC3-II (Fig 6A) . The LC3 lipidation process starts with a C-terminal cleavage by the proteinase ATG4B and covalent attachment first to ATG7 and then to ATG3 [71] [72] [73] . The ATG5/12/16L complex then acts as an E3 ligase, transferring the covalent attachment of LC3 from ATG3 to PE [74] . LC3 binds to p62 whether it is lipidated or not [75, 76] , and, indeed, we observe equal binding to p62 in WT and \u0394ATG5 cells and with GFP-LC3 or GFP-LC3-G120. However, autophagy-associated protein FYCO1 only binds to LC3-II [77] , as there were fewer peptide reads in \u0394ATG5 cells or when GFP-LC3-G120A was used. We saw little to no binding of ATG4B, which binds the terminal glycine of LC3 [72, 73] , when GFP-LC3-G120A was used. Interesting, ATG4B-LC3 binding was significantly reduced in \u0394ATG5 cells, perhaps because LC3-II is also one of its substrates [20, 78] . ATG7 and ATG3, which participate in the covalent conjugation of LC3 upstream of the function of ATG5, bound to GFP-LC3 in the presence or absence of ATG5. However, the G120A substitution cannot initiate the cascade of covalent attachments and is not recognized by either ATG7 or ATG3 [79] . Thus, the recovery of peptides from all five of these LC3-interacting proteins exhibits differential dependence on the lipidation status of LC3 in accordance with their biological roles.",

The viral peptides identified by IP-MS were mapped across the viral genome to visualize the viral proteins pulled down with LC3 ( Fig  6B) . In the absence of detergent, peptides from almost every viral protein were recovered (S4A Fig). However, in the presence of detergent, most peptides pulled down from WT cells were derived from capsid proteins and 2C (Fig 6B) . When we analyzed PV peptide reads as percentage of total reads, capsid proteins formed a large percentage of the total peptide reads in all conditions, suggesting that these viral proteins bind LC3 or LC3-associated membranes ( Fig  6C) . The ratio of reads in the presence of detergent to those in its absence showed that only peptides in 2C in WT cells remained associated with LC3 in the presence of detergent ( Fig  6D) .

Each virus, even closely related viruses like DENV and ZIKV, uses slightly different components, although they might ultimately use the subsequent membranes and degradative processes for similar purposes. Each virus requires a different subset of initiation components for efficient viral growth, although all three viruses utilize lipid scavenger ATG9 and recruit LC3 directly to membranes, bypassing the need for ATG5-mediated lipidation (Fig 7) . We believe that this comparative study addresses some of the inconsistencies seen with viral induction of the autophagy pathway.",

There is also evidence for a noncanonical autophagy pathway that is VPS34-dependent and BECN1-independent upon induction by arsenic trioxide [88] , providing precedent for the DENV-induced noncanonical pathway.

It has been shown previously that unlipidated LC3-I is found on viral-associated vesicles during infection with murine hepatitis virus, equine arteritis virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus [90] [91] [92] . These data, in addition to LC3-dependent and ATG7-independent viral amplification, led these authors to conclude that the virally induced membranes were not derived from the autophagy pathway. Instead, colocalization of ER degradation enhanced by alpha-mannosidase (EDEM1) and LC3 suggested that the virally induced vesicles were ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) associated [90] . We argue that direct recruitment of LC3 to membranes by viruses can perform autophagosome-like functions. Colocalization with EDEM1 could be a result of the known degradation of EDEM1-containing vesicles by an autophagy-like process [93] . We specifically found unlipidated LC3 associated with membranes during viral infection as well as direct binding of LC3 to PV proteins by IP-MS. A few cases of cellular LC3 lipidation-independent autophagy have been described [25, 94] . In these cases, when either ATG5 or ATG7 is ablated, the autophagy pathway can still proceed, leading to the formation of autophagosomes in response to unusual stimuli, such as the drug etoposide [25] . LC3 is not lipidated under these conditions. It remains unknown how these autophagosomes fuse without lipidated LC3. LC3-I has been found associated with membranes during cellular secretory processes, although how LC3-I is recruited to membranes was not tested [93] . It is possible that in these lipidation-independent cases protein-mediated recruitment of LC3-I occurs, as we observed during viral infection.",

This LIR motif was shown to be important for viral-mediated relocalization of LC3 to the plasma membrane, presumably to facilitate viral budding [95] . This represents a striking example of autophagosome relocalization by a virus. We have identified potentially functional viral LIR motifs in the capsid protein VP2 and 2BC protein of PV, as well as in the polyproteins of DENV and ZIKV. One hypothesis is that PV proteins bind LC3 as a means to localize PV-replication complexes and capsids specifically to autophagosome-like membranes for assembly purposes. 2BC is localized to replication complexes and is a membrane-associated protein [96] , so an interaction with LC3 at the outer surface of the double membrane is possible. The binding of capsid proteins to LC3 was unanticipated but of potential functional interest. Immature capsid precursors are known to be specifically associated with membranes [97] and intact virions can be released nonlytically by a process similar to secretory autophagy [39, 40, 98] . We propose that LC3 association of 2BC and immature capsids facilitate RNA replication, RNA packaging, and intercellular spread.",

The data presented here show that PV benefits from the induction of the canonical autophagy pathway but do not require all of the components when virally inducing the pathway. We hypothesize that pre-existing membrane structures from starvation-induced autophagy can be utilized by viruses for growth and maturation, leading to quicker exit from cells and overall more virus production. Malnutrition has been linked to increased death from infectious diseases in children [105] , and, although exacerbation of disease by malnutrition is often attributed to confounding effects, another outcome of malnutrition is induction of cellular autophagy. The implications of these data are broad: if viral infection is exacerbated by induction of the autophagy pathway, then starvation and many over-the-counter drugs that induce autophagy could lead to greater disease severity. It also implies that simple supplementation of nutrients to block induction of the autophagy pathway may help abrogate increased viral amplification.",

Similarly, transfection of a PV replicon that expressed firefly luciferase showed reduced protein accumulation in the KO cell lines (S3C Fig). To distinguish between defects in viral translation and RNA replication, we monitored translation at a 2-hour time point in the absence and presence of guanidine, a specific inhibitor of RNA replication. Only WT cells differed in their accumulation of luciferase in the absence or presence of guanidine (S3D Fig). Therefore, it is RNA replication that is specifically inhibited in the KO lines.",
