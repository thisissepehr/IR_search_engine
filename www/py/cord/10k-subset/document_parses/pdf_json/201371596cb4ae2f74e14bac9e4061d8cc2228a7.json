A number of international academic groups have developed and parameterized mathematical models of disease spread to forecast the trajectory of the outbreak. These modeling efforts often relied on limited epidemiological data to derive key transmission and severity parameters, which are needed to calibrate mechanistic models. Here, we provide a perspective on some of the challenges and lessons drawn from these efforts, focusing on (1) data availability and accuracy of early forecasts; (2) the ability of different models to capture the profile of early growth dynamics in local outbreaks and the importance of reactive behavior changes and case clustering; (3) challenges in forecasting the long-term epidemic impact very early in the outbreak; and (4) ways to move forward. We conclude that rapid availability of aggregated population-level data and detailed information on a subset of transmission chains is crucial to characterize transmission patterns, while ensemble-forecasting approaches could limit the uncertainty of any individual model. We believe that coordinated forecasting efforts, combined with rapid dissemination of disease predictions and underlying epidemiological data in shared online platforms, will be critical in optimizing the response to current and future infectious disease emergencies.",

The unprecedented spread of the virus was facilitated by delays in the initial identification of the outbreak, compounded by a systemic lack of health infrastructure in the region, as well as economic, social and cultural factors that hampered effective implementation of control efforts [1, 2] . The official end of the epidemic, with a final tally of 28,610 reported probable infections and 11,308 deaths [3] , offers a good opportunity to reflect on the lessons learned from the interdisciplinary efforts that guided the international response, particularly with regard to mathematical modeling.",

This was particularly salient during the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic, as a number of international academic groups developed mathematical models of disease spread to forecast the trajectory of the outbreak and guide the international response under different transmission and control scenarios [4] . These modeling efforts often relied on limited epidemiological data on key transmission and severity parameters for Ebola, which are needed to robustly calibrate mechanistic models. While a previous review article surveyed the characteristics, parameter estimates, and performance (accuracy) of 66 mathematical modeling studies published during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa [4] , we provide here a perspective on some of the challenges, experiences, and lessons drawn from the forecasting efforts. In particular, most models overestimated the peak and final size of the outbreak, in part because of failure to account for reactive population behavior and the clustered nature of transmission [4] . We believe that a more complete understanding of the factors that led to cessation of Ebola transmission and the regional (rather than global) spread of this particular outbreak could help improve predictive modeling of current and future infectious disease emergencies.",

The data included probable and confirmed cases, as reported by local clinics and health districts. Lack of trained staff in epidemiology and disease-surveillance issues, varied levels of community participation, and limited telephone and internet services challenged Ebola reporting in the most affected countries [6] . Nationally aggregated data available within 1-2 weeks of occurrence was the primary publicly available source documenting the epidemic's evolution. Many modelers around the world relied on this data source to estimate key transmission parameters and generate forecasts of morbidity and mortality impact ( Fig. 1 ) [4] . To remedy the coarseness of publicly available data, parallel efforts from academic groups and private individuals were rapidly put in place to compile information from a variety of online sources and adjust publicly available data for reporting biases [7, 8] .",

Even the Guinean district of Gueckedou, where the epidemic most likely originated, experienced a sub-exponential growth pattern by April 2014 (Fig. 3 ). Since this local outbreak took place before any large-scale attention or intervention measure ; the beginning of the line is when the prediction was made, whereas the end of the line marks the date the prediction is for (thus, shorter horizontal lines illustrate near-term predictions, while longer lines illustrate further time horizons). Data taken from JP Chretien's Elife review [4] was put in place, its growth patterns likely reflects the combined effects of reactive behavior changes and clustering of the contact network [5, 18, 19] . This departure from standard compartmental model theory affects estimates of transmission potential, projections of total epidemic sizes and the impact of interventions [20] . In particular, the effective reproduction number asymptomatically declines towards unity for sub-exponential growth outbreaks [21] . In contrast, for standard compartment models assuming exponential growth, the effective reproduction number remains invariant during the early phase of an epidemic, before susceptible depletion and interventions set in. Sub-exponential growth patterns seen during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa are reminiscent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US [22] [23] [24] , another infectious disease transmitted by contact via infectious body fluids. In contrast, for an infection like influenza, which transmits readily through aerosols and droplets, epidemic growth is close to exponential, especially in pandemic situations [17] . The mechanisms that give rise to different epidemic growth profiles include features of the host and pathogen, including transmission route, individual behaviors, background immunity, and control interventions [25] . The relative importance of these mechanisms is difficult to quantify, and thus to model, in the absence of detailed information on fine-scale contact patterns early in the epidemic. In the case of Ebola, it is now thought that a combination of mechanisms were involved, including the social contact network, the heterogeneous susceptibility and infectivity of the population, and the reactive preventive behavior changes or mitigating measures as the population becomes gradually aware of the epidemic [5] . In particular, Ebola transmission chains tend to be spatially clustered within households, treatment facilities, and unsafe burials, as would be expected for a disease transmitted by close contact. Furthermore, Ebola-infected individuals are typically confined at home or in healthcare settings, particularly at the peak of infectiousness [5] .",

This agent-based model provided a realistic description of the epidemic and reproduced key features of the observational data, namely early sub-exponential growth and saturation after a few generations of disease transmission [30, 31] (Fig. 5) .

Phenomenological models that characterize the early epidemic growth phase with limited case data, together with information about the distribution of the generation interval of the disease, have proved useful to generate robust estimates of the effective reproduction number. This approach does not require explicitly modeling the mechanisms of disease transmission and control [21, 35, 36] ; these methods are more suitable for outbreaks disseminating in large populations rather than confined to particular settings like hospitals, ships, or prisons [37] [38] [39] [40] . Furthermore, with detailed information on transmission chainsdescribing who infects whom and typically derived from contract-tracing effortsit becomes possible to generate more precise estimates of the reproduction number. In particular, one can assess changes in transmission by disease generation and pinpoint individuals who may contribute Fig. 4 Cumulative curves of four past Ebola outbreaks in Congo (1976, 1995, 2014) [47] [48] [49] and Uganda (2000) [50] . These curves display rapid saturation in case growth within the first 3-4 generations of disease transmission, consistent with early sub-exponential growth dynamics disproportionately to transmission (e.g., SARS [37] , MERS [37] , Ebola [31, 32, 41, 42] ).",

This requires predictions of outbreak trajectory a few weeks to months ahead, which are considered short-to longterm forecasts (more akin to climate rather than weather forecasts). An important caveat of such disease forecasts is that the magnitude of interventions and reactive behavior changes cannot be fully predicted, especially when there is little prior information from past outbreaks to rely on. This goes beyond the uncertainty associated with the underlying model structure and can really only be addressed through sensitivity analyses considering different epidemiological scenarios. Thus, early forecasting efforts that have more than a few weeks' time horizon should really be considered as scenario evaluations rather than projections per se.",

Indeed, based on epidemic data during the early epidemic growth phase, it is possible that (1) the data do not convey sufficient information to reliably ascertain the profile of epidemic growth and assess transmission potential and final size, even in the absence of interventions, and that (2) key aspects of transmission dynamics are not captured by the model (e.g., the model assumes a fixed type of epidemic growth). Transmission models that predict exponential growth can greatly overestimate epidemic size [4] without accounting for the mitigating effects of interventions or behavior changes (Fig. 6 ). More flexible models should be better equipped to fit the early growth dynamics of an epidemic process and provide more realistic uncertainty bounds for shortand long-term epidemic forecasts [17, 34] . Simple models incorporating generalized growth features have proved useful to characterize the early epidemic growth dynamics [17] and provide a starting point for characterizing epidemic growth and forecasting epidemic impact (e.g., epidemic size) [34] . The phenomenological models do not require a large amount of data; indeed, accurate assessment of the growth profile can be achieved within the first five disease generations (with 5-10 weeks' worth of weekly district-level incidences) across a range of pathogens. As the epidemic unfolds and more data become available about transmission chains, detailed mechanistic models can be developed to make specific inferences about the contribution of different transmission sources (e.g., hospital, funeral, community) and quantify the effectiveness of behavioral changes and control interventions [30, 31, 44] .",

Looking back, early in the West African outbreak, there was a good amount of information on natural history parameters and transmission routes from past outbreaks, but the importance of mobility and contact networks was unclear, since all prior outbreaks were highly restricted geographically and did not involve large treatment facilities. These uncertainties could have been resolved more rapidly than they were if detailed transmission chains had been available earlier [45] (in fact, the earliest transmission chains were published in October 2014 and January 2015 for outbreaks in Nigeria [42] and Guinea [32] , respectively).",

Clustering of contact networks, saturation effects, local burnouts, and behavioral changes are common to many diseases. Deviation from simple exponential behavior can also be expected in diseases with a seasonal component, mediated by the vector life cycle, such as the Chikungunya and Zika virus epidemics. While, in many cases, the lack of data might not serve more elaborate models, the need for a portfolio of models that allow for deviations from the standard theory is extremely important. Such models should span the gamut of complexity, from highly abstracted phenomenological models (best when little data) to compartmental models allowing for behavior changes or clustered transmission, to more complex and highly detailed agent-based models. Looking to weather forecasts for guidance, a field with a well-established history of predictive approaches relying on real-time modeling analyses of multiple layers of data streams, policymakers will want to rely on ensemble model predictions rather than on any individual approach. Ensemble model predictions provide a broader and more accurate picture of the possible evolution of an emerging outbreak and, in turn, offer more solid guidance for control interventions. None of these modeling approaches are feasible without timely sharing of high-resolution epidemiological data and collaboration to interpret early data on transmissibility and severity [46] . This point was made in 2003 during the SARS crisis, but data sharing still has a long way to go as was evident in the 2014 Ebola crisis, and more recently in the Zika outbreak. As we look to the future, we must envision coordinated modeling and forecasting efforts facilitated though interactive website platforms and involving multiple research groups. Only in this way can individual groups, in real-time, readily share their approaches and results relying on consistent data Forecasting early epidemic growth phase data featuring sub-exponential growth dynamics using a classic exponential growth model (left) and the generalized growth model (right). The shaded region corresponds to the model calibration period and the non-shaded area corresponds to the forecasting period. Circles correspond to the case-series data. The blue curves correspond to the ensemble of epidemic forecasts. The red solid and dashed lines correspond to the median and interquartile range computed from the ensemble of forecasts, respectively. This figure illustrates how extrapolations of epidemic impact from the early growth trend in case incidence of an epidemic are subject to both model and data uncertainty. Transmission models calibrated using a few data points of the early phase of an infectious disease outbreak assuming exponential growth epidemic dynamics, such as the widely used SIR-type compartmental models, are unable to predict anything other than an exponentially growing epidemic in the absence of susceptible depletion, interventions or behavior changes, leading to great overestimation of cumulative case burden. More flexible transmission models, such as the generalized growth model, capture a wider range of epidemic growth profiles, ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth dynamics. Please note the figures are on a different scale sources and adequately documented methods, receive peer feedback, and disseminate collective results in joint publications.",

Interestingly, the popularity of this search term quickly plummeted after the epidemic peaked on week 40. For visualization purposes, the curve of the weekly number of new cases is square root transformed while the Google search trends indicate how often the terms \"Ebola\" and \"Exponential Ebola\" are searched for relative to the total number of searches (scale ranges from 0 to 100). The weekly series start with the first week in January 2014 Representative time series of the cumulative number of weekly Ebola cases at the district level in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.

The shaded region corresponds to the model calibration period and the non-shaded area corresponds to the forecasting period. Circles correspond to the case-series data. The blue curves correspond to the ensemble of epidemic forecasts. The red solid and dashed lines correspond to the median and interquartile range computed from the ensemble of forecasts, respectively. This figure illustrates how extrapolations of epidemic impact from the early growth trend in case incidence of an epidemic are subject to both model and data uncertainty. Transmission models calibrated using a few data points of the early phase of an infectious disease outbreak assuming exponential growth epidemic dynamics, such as the widely used SIR-type compartmental models, are unable to predict anything other than an exponentially growing epidemic in the absence of susceptible depletion, interventions or behavior changes, leading to great overestimation of cumulative case burden. More flexible transmission models, such as the generalized growth model, capture a wider range of epidemic growth profiles, ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth dynamics.
