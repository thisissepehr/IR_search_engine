There are no approved treatments for RSV infection in HCT recipients, although several candidates are in development for treatment of RSV infections in various populations [3] [4] [5] [6] , including HCT recipients [7, 8] . Historically, mortality rates in HCT recipients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) due to RSV have been as high as 55% [9] [10] [11] . However, more-recent studies of subjects with either upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or LRTI have demonstrated substantially lower mortality rates (5%-10%), which may in part be due to improvements in transplantation practices, including the use of nonmyeloablative conditioning and changes in supportive care practices [12, 13] . Additional factors may reduce the reported mortality rates, such as the lack of clear delineation of disease site (upper versus lower respiratory tract) and the variation in LRTI definition. The strictest definition of LRTI requires detection of RSV in the lower respiratory tract [9, 10] ; however, several studies use more-lenient definitions that rely on detection of RSV in the upper respiratory tract alone with LRTI symptoms and/or abnormal radiographic findings, without documentation of RSV in the lower respiratory tract [11, 12, 14] . These variations in the LRTI definition can affect disease prevalence and outcome estimates, variables that influence clinical trial design.

Death due to any cause only occurred in patients with proven/probable LRTI. We also demonstrated significant reductions in the number of supplemental oxygen-free days for patients with proven/ probable LRTI as compared to those with possible LRTI. These data support the use of supplemental oxygen-free days as a potential clinical endpoint that could be associated with significant reductions in sample size. RSV infection in HCT recipients has historically been associated with significant mortality, with death rates of up to 55% in patients with LRTI [9] [10] [11] . However, mortality rates have been declining, presumably because of changes in transplantation practices, such as declining use of myeloablative regimens and improved supportive care practices. Additionally, previous studies of RSV in HCT recipients have used different definitions of LRTI which may account for wide variations in endpoints, including progression to LRTI, supplemental oxygen use, and mortality [1, 10, 11, 15, 18] . Current guidelines also include possible LRTI in recommendations for management of RSV Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; LRTI, lower respiratory tract infection; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

We found substantial differences in supplemental oxygen use, the number of supplemental oxygen-free days, and mortality between subjects with and those without RSV detected in the lower respiratory tract. Our data demonstrate that subjects with possible LRTI required very little supplemental oxygen and had no deaths and that they are more similar to subjects with URTI only, regardless of initial presentation. Conversely, patients with proven/probable LRTI are the only subjects who died and had significantly higher use of supplemental oxygen. These data are consistent with a previous study evaluating parainfluenza virus LRTI in HCT recipients, in which outcomes in possible LRTI cases were significantly better than in proven/probable LRTI cases [16] . Taken together, these data suggest that a less conservative approach to defining LRTI without determining whether RSV is truly in the lower respiratory tract (in cases where imaging findings are abnormal) may be clinically misleading and contributes to the finding that mortality rates appear to have decreased among patients with a diagnosis of RSV LRTI. The number of supplemental oxygen-free days as an endpoint was also evaluated in the current study. Supplemental oxygen use correlates with acute lung injury, which, in turn, is associated with mortality in HCT recipients [15, 20, 21] . Additionally, supplemental oxygen use typically requires hospitalization; thus, the number of supplemental oxygen-free days represent a composite endpoint that takes into account disease severity, need for hospitalization, and mortality. Our data showed significant decreases in supplemental oxygen-free days in subjects with any LRTI as compared to those with URTI, and further decreases were seen in subjects with proven/probable LRTI as compared to those with possible LRTI. Ventilator-free days were first defined in the 1990s and then introduced to the ARDSNet in 2002 by Schoenfeld et al [22, 23] , and they have been used as an end point extensively in the intensive care unit literature. Several studies, including randomized controlled trials [24] [25] [26] [27] and limited studies of viral infections such as enteroviruses [28] , influenza virus [29, 30] , and herpes viruses [31] in critically ill patients, have since used this end point. Our definition of supplemental oxygen-free days is consistent with Schoenfeld's original definition for ventilator-free days in acute respiratory distress syndrome [23] , with 2 notable exceptions. First, given the low rates of mechanical ventilation in this cohort (7% overall), our study was not sufficiently powered to evaluate ventilator-free days and thus evaluated supplemental oxygen-free days. Generally, patients receiving >2 L of supplementary oxygen per minute require hospital admission, and thus an increasing number of supplemental oxygen-free days still represents significant healthcare cost savings. Second, the effect of death was evaluated both with the traditional definition (wherein death at any point during the 28-day period gives a score of 0 supplemental oxygen-free days for that subject) and with a definition that allows any days prior to death during which no supplemental oxygen was used to be counted as supplemental oxygen-free days. This second definition was used, given the high levels of competing risk of death in transplant recipients. Ultimately, only 3 subjects had any supplemental oxygen-free days prior to death, and thus mean and median supplemental oxygen-free days did not vary greatly with use of either definition. Numbers of supplemental oxygen-free days were significantly different among subjects, based on their initial presentation (groups 1, 2, and 3), as well as by the classification of LRTI (possible vs proven/probable; Figure 3 ). The lowest median number of supplemental oxygen-free days occurred in patients presenting with proven/probable LRTI (13 days), followed by subjects with proven/probable LRTI regardless of presentation (17 days). In contrast, subjects with possible LRTI in either group 2 or 3 had a median of 29 supplemental oxygen-free days, the same as subjects with URTI only. These data, along with mortality outcomes outlined above, suggest that the prognosis of HCT recipients with RSV detected in the upper respiratory tract and radiographic abnormalities requires sampling of the lower respiratory tract (eg, BAL) to determine whether proven LRTI is present. Confirmation of RSV LRTI with BAL can provide useful prognostic information and may help stratify patients by risk and help prioritize expensive and intensive therapeutic options. Currently, ribavirin is the only antiviral available for specific treatment of RSV disease [10, 11, 15, 32] ; however, cost remains a prohibitive barrier to its use, with an estimated cost of greater than $250 000 for a 10-day course [33] . Risk stratification based on confirmation of probable/proven LRTI may assist in treatment considerations for HCT recipients with RSV. In addition, several antivirals are in phase 2 trials for treatment of RSV infections in various populations [5, [34] [35] [36] [37] , including HCT recipients [7, 8] , and risk stratification may help develop rational prevention and treatment strategies for immunocompromised patients with these agents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1063, "end": 1067, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1648, "end": 1652, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1653, "end": 1656, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1660, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2261, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2262, "end": 2265, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2415, "end": 2419, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2424, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2425, "end": 2429, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2430, "end": 2434, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2501, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2520, "end": 2524, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2525, "end": 2528, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2554, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2779, "end": 2783, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 5027, "end": 5031, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 5032, "end": 5035, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 5036, "end": 5039, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 5040, "end": 5043, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 5170, "end": 5174, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 5420, "end": 5423, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 5424, "end": 5428, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 5429, "end": 5433, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 5434, "end": 5438, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 5439, "end": 5443, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 5471, "end": 5474, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 5475, "end": 5477, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4094, "end": 4102, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Based on outcome data from the current study, we calculated estimated sample size requirements to compare the 28-day mortality rate and number of supplemental oxygen-free days by day 28 as endpoints in subjects with proven/probable LRTI (Table 4) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 246, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplemental oxygen-free days have the potential to significantly reduce the per arm sample size, compared with a traditional mortality endpoint, and could potentially aid in designing clinical trials with feasible sample sizes while maintaining a clinically relevant endpoint.

Because this is the first-time that supplemental oxygen-free days has been evaluated for RSV infection in HCT recipients and because this is a single center study, further studies that implement strict criteria for evaluating the need for supplemental oxygen and apply consistent definitions are needed.

First, this is a retrospective review, and the use of BAL to evaluate LRTI is largely based on protocols at our center, which recommend BAL when RSV is detected in the upper respiratory tract and radiographic abnormalities are present. However, the decision to pursue bronchoscopy is ultimately left to the attending physician, and thus some potential probable or proven cases may have been missed. Despite this inherent limitation in capturing the proven/probable LRTI cases, we demonstrated differences in clinical outcomes between groups. Additionally, the definition of a supplemental oxygenfree day as one during which supplementation with \u22642 L of oxygen per minute was required relies on subjective clinical decisions that may not have a physiological correlate. However, the requirement of a sustained 48-hour period without use of >2 L of supplemental oxygen per minute to be deemed an supplemental oxygen-free day should account for this inherent variability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our data demonstrate that patients with RSV detected in the lower respiratory tract (ie, those with proven/probable LRTI) had worse outcomes than patients with RSV detected in the upper respiratory tract only despite the presence of radiographic abnormalities (ie, those with possible LRTI). The separation of LRTI into these groups could be useful in future outcomes research; however, validation of these results with other sites and protocols will be important. One potential application would be in cross-validating the immunodeficiency scoring index suggested for use in HCT recipients with RSV infection, to help develop consensus definitions [14] . Furthermore, by using a more conservative approach to defining LRTI and implementing supplemental oxygen-free days as a surrogate clinical endpoint, we believe clinical trials may be able to use smaller sample sizes, thereby facilitating more-rapid development of novel agents to treat RSV infections in HCT recipients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 664, "end": 668, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online.
