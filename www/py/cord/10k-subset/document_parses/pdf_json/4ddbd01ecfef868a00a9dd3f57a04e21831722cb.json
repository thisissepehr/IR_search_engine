Results: The sensitivities of Xpert MTB/RIF (27.4%), LAMP (26.5%) and SAT-TB assay (32.3%) were significantly higher than that of pleural effusion smear (14.3%, X 2 = 20.65, P < 0.001), whereas they were much lower than expected for the analysis of pleural effusion samples. Both SAT-TB assay and Xpert MTB/RIF demonstrated high specificities (100%) and PPVs (100%), but the NPVs of all of the tests were < 22%. The area under ROC curve of pleural effusion smear, LAMP, Xpert MTB/RIF and SAT-TB assays was 0.524 (95% CI 0.431-0.617), 0.632 (95% CI 0.553-0.71), 0.637 (95% CI 0.56-0.714) and 0.673 (95% CI 0.6-0.745).

Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) represented 14% of the 6.4 million incident cases notified in 2017, globally [1] . The most common form of EPTB is tuberculous pleurisy (TBP) [2] . However, the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in pleural effusion (PE) smear is unacceptably low and non-tuberculos Mycobacterium (NTM) is also positive [3] . The definite diagnosis of TBP is made by detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) from PE or pleural tissue [4] , but culturing M. tuberculosis will take 2-8 weeks to obtain the results, which can delay effective medical interventions [5] . Delayed antituberculosis treatment may result in pleural thickening or tuberculous empyema that requires surgical resolution [6, 7] . Therefore, diagnosis of TBP is sometimes referred to pleural biopsy. However, pleural biopsy is invasive and adds considerable cost to the workup. In addition, biopsy of pleural tissue for histological examination may still have false negative rate of about 20% [8] . Technological advances in nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have led to breakthroughs in TB diagnosis with turnaround time under 2 h [9] . Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), endorsed by the Scientific and Technical Advisory Board of the WHO, integrates hemi-nested real-time Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific DNA amplification and simultaneous detection of mutations in the rifampicin resistanceassociated rpoB mutations [10] . However, the requirement of expensive specialized equipment and the high cost of the assay make it unaffordable for large-scale use in developing countries. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a DNA amplification at a constant temperature by one type of enzyme with rapid and simple features which make it a promising diagnostic method for point-of-care testing and for resources limited countries [11] . Simultaneous amplification and testing for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) (SAT-TB assay) is a relatively new method based on real-time fluorescence simultaneous isothermal RNA amplification. Since RNA is much more unstable than DNA, so SAT-TB assay (SAT-TB) has the advantage of lower false-positive rates and good reproducibility [12] . Previous studies of NAATs have demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB with sputum specimens [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, there is still limited data on the performance of NAATs on the diagnosis of TBP with pleural fluid specimens.

[27] . In a meta-analysis of 40 studies of NAATs for TBP, PAI et al. reported that these tests had low sensitivities (43-77%), but high specificities (95%) [28] . The reasons for the low sensitivity of NAATs in PE specimens but high sensitivity in sputum samples are not clear. The presence of inhibitory substances in PE is not a satisfactory explanation, as studies have shown that some substances of potential inhibitors of nucleic acid detection, such as RNases, were similar in sputum and non-sputum specimens [29] . The paucity of MTB in PE may play some role, but the low sensitivity is more likely to be relevant to techniques of nucleic acid extraction. Therefore, the consistent high specificities of NAATs indicated their potential role in confirming TBP as 'rule-in' tests and were not useful in excluding the disease. Caution should be exercised when interpreting negative NAATs results in PE. In addition, it's worth mentioning that ADA remains the most widely used diagnostic PE marker as a screening tool for TBP in resource-limited settings where tuberculosis is endemic, since it has the advantage of costeffectiveness, efficiency, noninvasiveness, and ease of operation [30, 31] . In our current study, 201out of 223 TBP patients (90.13%) had an ADA level over 25 U/l, while 10 out of 42 (23.8%) non-TBP also had an ADA level over 25 U/l.
