If it is, we surmise that physicians may have been more likely to treat severe cases than milder ones or to treat putative at-risk groups such as pregnant women with NAIs. Therefore, the treated group would have a higher underlying likelihood of being admitted to the hospital; this in turn would produce a bias in the analysis, tending toward underestimation of any treatment effect. Likewise, we recognize that some NAI treatment may have been given immediately prior to hospital admission when there was no practical window in which an antiviral drug could have had time to work or perhaps even when the physician had already decided that the patient needed to be admitted.

However, the disparity in effect size might be explained by the fact that the 4 studies [17] metaanalyzed by Hsu et al included patients with generally milder influenza than in the present study. In addition, 3 of these 4 studies were based on diagnoses of influenza-like illness (ILI) without laboratory confirmation and therefore were highly vulnerable to misclassification bias. An earlier pooled analysis of clinical trial data from patients with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza also showed a 59% reduction in hospitalization [18] . This was confirmed in recent IPD analysis of seasonal influenza patients that reported a risk reduction of 63% in treated patients (intention-to-treat infected population) [19] , which is somewhat similar to our own data. Another study not included in Hsu's metaanalysis also suggested a 29% reduction in hospitalization associated with oseltamivir but was again based on diagnoses of ILI without laboratory confirmation [20] . A recent study from British Columbia, based on clinically diagnosed cases of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, also noted 16% effectiveness of NAIs in reducing hospitalization [21] ; however, the hospitalization rate in this cohort was 0.6%, suggesting cases were comparatively very mild.
