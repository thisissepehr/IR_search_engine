            "text": "A new artificial liver support system (ALSS) consisting ofplasma exchange (PE) in combination with hemodiafiltration (HDF) using high-performance membranes of polymethyl metacrylate (PMMA) and cellulose triacetate (CTA) was developed to efficiently remove middle molecules from plasma and treat fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) complicated by the onset of hepatic coma. Twenty-seven patients with FHF due to viral hepatitis, two with type A (HA), nine with type B (HB), and 16 with type non-A, non-B (NANB) underwent therapy with this new ALSS over the last five years. Three patients with an exacerbation of chronic HB and 15/16 with type NANB hepatitis were treated with interferon (IFN) also. Of these, 25 patients (92. 6%) regained consciousness and 15 (55. 6%) [1/2 (50%) with type A, 6/9 (66. 7%) with type B and 8/16 (50%) with type NANB hepatitis] survived. Ineluding four patients who survived with intensive care and plasma exchange alone, 19/31 (61.3%) patients survived. Because of its biocompatibility, both survivors and nonsurvivors couM be sustained with the ALSS without complications for long periods (19.3 days for the survivors and 32. 4 days for nonsurvivors). With this ALSS the ability to sustain life for such prolonged periods allows hepatic regeneration to occur and result in patient survival. It is anticipated that this new ALSS will not only be of value in cases of fulminant hepatic failure but that it may also play a role in sustaining life for those awaiting liver transplantation.

From a clinical viewpoint, however, two functions are particularly important. These are: (1) The production of plasma proteins, especially coagulation factors; and (2) the metabolism of various molecules having a potential for central nervous system (CNS) toxicity. Loss of these two functions is responsible for the two major clinical problems associated with FHF: bleeding and coma. Thus restoration of these two hepatic functions is a prerequisite for an effective ALSS. The poor effect of all existing ALSS can be attributed to a failure to either completely or at least partially restore these two functions.",

Subsequent experimental studies using dogs with experimental F H F disclosed that the charcoal PP enhanced coagulation and fibrinolysis resulting in severe DIC (22) . Activation of factor XII on the surface of uncoated activated charcoal may be responsible for this untoward phenomenon.

Nonetheless, this high rate of transient as well as complete recovery from hepatic coma is in marked contrast with the 50% value reported for charcoal HP (3), 17/41 (43.6%) (5), and 9/24 (37.5%) (8) for the PAN HDF. Moreover, it is considerably better than the 14/26 (53.8%) recovery reported by us using charcoal PP (4). The four patients who failed to respond to the ALSS and the six patients who relapsed into coma all had either markedly atrophied livers on admission or experienced progressive hepatic atrophy despite ALSS. This point is documented by the average liver weight of seven autopsied cases, which was 460 + 170 g. The lowest mean serum DBil/TBil ratio that reflects hepatic bilirubin conjugation capacity was 0.19 ---0.14 for the seven patients who died. Their mean lowest BUN level, which reflects overall urea cycle capacity of the liver, was markedly reduced at 2.7 +__ 3.9 mg/dl. Moreover the extremely high plasma Gin level, the end product of an alternative ammonia detoxifying pathway, further documents the severity of the urea cycle dysfunction in these seven cases. It is noteworthy that even the most severe case, in which liver weight was only 210 g at autopsy and in which occurred the lowest DBil/TBil ratio and BUN levels at 0.05 and 0.6 mg/dl, respectively, could be maintained conscious while ingesting a 60-g protein 1600-cal diet while on the ALSS and requiring 4.8 liters of FFP and 30 liters of substitution fluid.",
