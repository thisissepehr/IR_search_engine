Under the imposed vaccination policy and antiviral treatment in society, complex factors (costs and expected effects of the vaccines and treatments, and fear of being infected) trigger an emulous situation in which individuals avoid infection by the pre-emptive or ex post provision. Aside from the established voluntary vaccination game, we propose a treatment game model associated with the resistance evolution of antiviral/antibiotic overuse. Moreover, the imperfectness of vaccinations has inevitably led to anti-vaccine behaviour, necessitating a proactive treatment policy. However, under the excessively heavy implementation of treatments such as antiviral medicine, resistant strains emerge. The model explicitly exhibits a dual social dilemma situation, in which the treatment behaviour changes on a local time scale, and the vaccination uptake later evolves on a global time scale. The impact of resistance evolution and the coexistence of dual dilemmas are investigated by the control reproduction number and the social efficiency deficit, respectively.

According to prior studies, a game approach to epidemiological vaccination can fairly predict the infection risk in both vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals [49] [50] [51] [52] . Such voluntary vaccination game approaches have been studied theoretically and in multi-agent simulations (MAS). To elucidate the mechanism of infectiousdisease control, these approaches incorporate a two-layer time scale: a local time scale (epidemic season) of epidemic diffusion and a global time scale on which the strategy updates at the end of the season (at local equilibrium), followed by repeated seasons. Kuga & Tanimoto [53] developed a theoretical model of imperfect vaccination on local and global time scales and validated it by MAS. However, Kabir & Tanimoto [54] claimed that an individual's decision to take a vaccination after social learning (dynamical behaviour) also occurs on local time scales, so this strategy should be updated instantly. Accordingly, it seems that the voluntary vaccination game approach can be implemented into the local time scale while maintaining the framework on the global time scale (strategy update at the end of each season).

This approach admits different strategy update rules and different time scales of the two provisions. In most of the previous studies [5, 6, [39] [40] [41] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] , the proactive vaccination permits an individual to accept or decline a vaccination at the end of every epidemic season. This repeated choice is made on global time scales. On the other hand, the retroactive treatment prescribes the behaviour and the antiviral resistance of a certain individual only when s/he is actually infected at a certain time in an epidemic season, which occurs on local time scales. An excessive antiviral treatment may also trigger another viral resistant strain; this behaviour is an expected social problem concerning seasonal influenza in Japan [55] . In this case, the so-called vaccination dilemma modelled by the vaccination game is joined by another dilemma, whereby an individual seeking to use public goods (i.e. accepting the antiviral) induces another viral strain with devastating consequences for others. Using our novel idea backed by the theoretical game approach, we quantify the impact of the pre-emptive vaccination game (before the disease spreading) and the treatment game (after the infection), which includes the prescribing behaviour as an ex post provision. Both games are influenced by vaccine effectiveness, treatment efficacy, treatment cost and vaccination cost. Such a double social dilemma situation, perhaps quite ubiquitous in the real world, has not been considered in related previous studies. The vaccination game in the double-dilemma scenario occurs on a larger time scale (over repeated seasons) than the treatment game, which occurs on a day-by-day basis. Therefore, a coevolutionary process can be plausibly modelled in the present study. We employ a pre-emptive control measure that prevents the breakout of infection at an early stage based on an individual's decision. Meanwhile, the ex post treatment can be regarded as a fail-safe provision implemented after infection. Owing to the imperfections of vaccines and the unwillingness to take vaccines as a pre-emptive provision, people probably consider a retroactive treatment as the 'ultimate weapon' against disease dispersion. However, overuse of antiviral treatment and prescribing behaviour can trigger the emergence of resistant strains, encouraging more ex post provision activity by individuals. To handle these two provisions working on different time scales, our model implants the second social dilemma incurred by the antiviral treatment rather than the so-called vaccination dilemma acquired by the proactive provision. To our knowledge, no previous theoretical analysis has considered two provisions in the same context of the evolutionary game process. We also develop another new concept called the social efficiency deficit (SED). Such a framework can explicitly elucidate the social dual-dilemma on both global (vaccination) and local (treatment) time scales.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 320, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 321, "end": 323, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 324, "end": 328, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 329, "end": 333, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 334, "end": 338, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 339, "end": 343, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 344, "end": 348, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 354, "end": 358, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 359, "end": 363, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 939, "end": 943, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In our model, the retroactive antiviral treatment targets the individuals harbouring a sensitive or resistant strain that is controlled by the treatment (antiviral/antibiotic) potency (efficacy).

Here, we emphasize the social learning behaviour for prescription of antiviral treatment under the evolutionary dynamics of resistance that can uphold the optimal use of the treatment. To explore this evolutionary process of vaccination and treatment, we impose three strategy update rules: individual-based risk assessment (IB-RA), society-based risk assessment (SB-RA) and direct commitment (DC).

In stage 1, the individuals make their vaccination decisions (yes or no) that will control their infection risk during the pandemic season. In stage 2, the infected people with either the sensitive strain or resistant strain decide their treatment provision (treated or untreated) on the local time scale. The antiviral (antibiotic) treatment case incorporates a feedback loop between the prescription behaviour and resistance evolution. To model the disease diffusion in a single season, the initially susceptible people are compartmentalized into vaccinated and nonvaccinated groups. The individuals in the susceptible state can be infected with either sensitive or resistant strains, then seek treatment at an overall treatment rate (treatment probability) denoted as \u03c9P , where P is the prescribing rate and \u03c9 determines the probability at which infected people accept treatment from the prescribing individuals. Consequently, the individuals can recover in two ways: natural recovery with no antibiotic/antiviral treatment or recovery after treatment. The epidemiological dynamics are described by the following system of ordinary differential equations\u1e60 Here, the fractions of vaccinated plus non-vaccinated individuals infected with the sensitive and resistant strains are denoted by I u sen and I u res , respectively. T denotes the fraction of infected individuals receiving treatment and R represents the fraction of individuals who have recovered from infection by a sensitive or resistant strain.

Finally, \u03bc s and \u03bc r are the mutation rates of the sensitive and resistant strains, respectively. Without mutation, the coexistence of sensitive and resistant strains is forbidden by the competitive exclusion principle. The portion of vaccinated individuals is separated into perfectly immune and nonimmune individuals, distinguished by the vaccine's effectiveness e(0 \u2264 e \u2264 1). The treatment efficacy \u03b5 controls the treatment efficiency of the sensitive and resistant strains. When \u03b5 = 0, the treatment is far less beneficial against the resistant strain than against the sensitive strain.

Unlike simple 2 by 2 games in which the so-called dilemma strength (DS) can be explicitly defined [1] , a real social dilemma typically observed in the vaccination game [2, [5] [6] [7] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , traffic flow [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] and others may have a time-variable game structure. In the vaccination and traffic games, this structure is mainly influenced by the disease-spreading and traffic flow dynamics, respectively. The timevariable game structure is too complex to represent by the payoff matrix in a 2 \u00d7 2 game or the time-constant payoff structure function in the 2-strategy and n-player game. Thus, the DS is difficult to determine in advance even when the mathematical model is well defined. Our new SED concept (defined above and mathematically formulated blow) was inspired by the seminal idea of traffic flow analysis (e.g. [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] ). The DS indicates the existence or absence of a social dilemma (behaving as a prognostic index), whereas the SED provides an 'ex post' or diagnostic index. Here, let us define SED as the gap between the result of the evolutionary trail (which can be evaluated by the Nash equilibrium (NE)) and the optimum solution (ideal result from a social-welfare standpoint [63] ). The payoff at the NE can always be observed by taking an evolutionary game approach, whereas the optimal social payoff is observable in a model of any complexity. Therefore, one can evaluate the SED in any context, and hence predict the occurrence of a social dilemma (if the SED is positive, the gap exists; if it is zero, the evolutionary trail matches the optimum). Thus, the SED indicates that the payoff can be improved from that at the NE. Mathematically, the SED is given by SED = (social optimal payoff) \u2212 (payoff at Nash equilibrium) ( Again, let us reiterate that SED = 0 implies no social dilemma, while any social dilemma causes a positive SED. According to the abovementioned conceptual definition, SED in the current model (which deals with both vaccination and treatment games) is given by", "cite_spans": [{"start": 731, "end": 734, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 802, "end": 805, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 806, "end": 809, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 810, "end": 813, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 814, "end": 817, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 818, "end": 822, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 823, "end": 827, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 828, "end": 832, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 833, "end": 837, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 838, "end": 842, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 843, "end": 847, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 848, "end": 852, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 853, "end": 857, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 858, "end": 862, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 878, "end": 882, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 883, "end": 887, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 888, "end": 892, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 893, "end": 897, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 898, "end": 902, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 903, "end": 907, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 908, "end": 912, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1525, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1530, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1535, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1540, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1545, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1550, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1555, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1920, "end": 1924, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 2471, "end": 2472, "text": "(", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 200, "text": "figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF18"}], "section": "(a) Dual-dilemma structure"}, {"text": "Meanwhile, the ASP is the quantity of payoff.

For this fixed (e i , \u03b5 j ), evaluate ASP To address whether a dual dilemma exists in the vaccination and treatment games, we plot the SED diagrams in the vaccination effectiveness (e) versus treatment efficacy (\u03b5) planes at different costs. Panels A and B of figure 8 are plotted under the strategy update rules IB-RA and SB-RA, respectively, and plots (a-*) and (b-*) present the SEDs in the vaccination game SED v and the treatment game SED T , respectively. Moreover, the combined vaccination and treatment costs (C r , C T ) were varied as (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.9), (0.9, 0.1) (0.1, 0.1), and (0.9, 0.9) in plots (*-i), (*-ii), (*-iii) and (*-iv), respectively. As demonstrated in the above SED formulation, the dilemma situation (non-white areas in the plots) appeared in all cases, but interestingly depended on e and \u03b5. Nodilemma regions, in which either the vaccination or treatment game became trivial, were also observed. Now, comparing panels (a-i) and (a-ii) for C r = 0.1 with panels (a-iii) and (a-iv) for C r = 0.9, one finds that the non-dilemma region (whiteout region) expanded with increasing vaccination cost. At the smaller vaccination cost (C r = 0.1), the region of larger SED appeared at a relatively low vaccination effectiveness (around e = 0.4; dotted red box in panel (a-i)). The huge gap between NE and the social optimal results from the lower NE due to a lower efficiency which makes fewer people commit vaccination when compared with a situation allowing a relatively higher efficiency which makes much more people commit. By contrast, a relatively high vaccination efficiency entices people to vaccinate, thus increasing the NE. Meanwhile, increasing the vaccination cost (C r = 0.9) shifted the region of reasonably high SED to the maximally high vaccination effectiveness (dotted blue box in panel (a-iv)). This occurred because despite the high vaccination effectiveness, low vaccination efficiency hampers the commitment to vaccination. Reliable vaccination provides a high commitment incentive, but high cost encourages free-riding on the herd immunity of the devoted others. In summary, we have numerically demonstrated that the SED precisely and easily detects the social dilemma in our dual-dilemma coevolutionary model.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 268, "end": 276, "text": "figure 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF21"}], "section": "(a) Dual-dilemma structure"}, {"text": "This paper developed an SITR/V epidemic model that combines the effects of proactive vaccination and retroactive treatment on the control and prevention of infectious viral diseases. The model building and its investigation were presented in this work. The most important contribution is that our new model gives a brand-new framework in which both pre-emptive vaccination and treatment as an ex post provision having different evolutionary time scales, which dovetails the ideological dynamics with the dynamics of the human decision-making process. This concept has been never studied. Also, our model gives a clear procedure to quantify the social dilemmas, respectively, entailed by 'vaccination game' and 'treatment game'. The most novel aspect of our model is the simultaneous implementation of two social dilemma games: the antiviral treatment game and the vaccination game, which none of the previous work has tried to implement. The vaccination game implements on the global time scale under two strategy adaptation rules: IB-RA and SB-RA, assuming an infinite and well-mixed population. Meanwhile, the treatment game describes the behaviour of antiviral administration with resistant-strain emergence. The treatment game is updated on the local time scale by presuming the DC rule, and precisely integrating a feedback loop between the sensitive and resistant strains. The outcome of antiviral and vaccination use depends on the effectiveness of the vaccine, the efficiency of treatment and their corresponding costs. Increasing the effectiveness of the vaccine and lowering its administration cost reduced the final epidemic size (increased vaccination coverage). Lowering the treatment cost and enhancing the treatment efficacy exerted a similar effect. Thus, by applying retroactive antiviral use with pre-emptive vaccination, we can deeply understand and investigate individual decisions regarding vaccination and implement proper strategies that lessen the diffusion of infection or recommend appropriate and careful administration of both antivirals and vaccination. We also introduced the social optimum point P c that distinguishes the conditions under which treatment resistance emerges under antibiotic overuse and its associated factors. Besides evolving the voluntary vaccination game, our model introduces a new game aspect with two provisions: vaccination as a proactive measure and treatment as a retroactive measure. Presuming seasonal influenza-like diseases, the (pre-emptive) vaccination works over repeated seasons on global time scales, whereas the ex post treatment works seasonally on local time scales and depends on the antiviral cost, prescription behaviour and resistant-strain emergence. In the present model, we successfully established a 'double-layer' game structure of pre-emptive vaccination and ex post treatment. Unlike the vaccination game model, which only considers whether the vaccine is accepted or declined, and whether an ex post provision is taken in a single season, the treatment game includes an aspect that depends on the antiviral resistance evolution and prescribing behaviour. To explicitly prove the dual-dilemma situation in the 'double-layer' game, we proposed the SED indicator, which quantifies whether the dynamics develop a social dilemma structure. This indicator is measured by the gap between the NE and the social optimal state. The dilemma strength [64] [65] [66] , which explains the dilemma structure in simple two-player and two-strategy (2 \u00d7 2) games, is too simplistic for realistic dilemma games with substantially complex and time-dependent structures, such as vaccination games and traffic flow analysis. However, SED can quantify whether a game intrinsically has a social dilemma or not. We applied the SED to the present social dual-dilemma game, in which both vaccination and treatment dilemmas are inevitable.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3421, "end": 3425, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3426, "end": 3430, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3431, "end": 3435, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Data accessibility.
