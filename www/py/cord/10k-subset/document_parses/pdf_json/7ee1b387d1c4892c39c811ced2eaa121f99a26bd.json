To explore the relationship between national and global processes for governing global health, this paper asks: in what forms of interaction between NPGH arenas and global health governance are learning and networking processes present? In a multiple case study of Norwegian and Swiss NPGH arenas, we collected data on intersectoral policy processes from semi-structured interviews with 33 informants in 2014-2015. Adapting Real-Dato's framework, we analyzed each case separately, producing monographs for comparing NPGH arenas. Analyzing both NPGH arenas for relational structures linking external resources to internal policy arena processes, we found five zones of interactions -including institutions, transgovernmental clubs, and connective forms. These interactions circulate ideas and soften arenas' boundaries. We argue that NPGH is characteristic of transnational governance of global health.",

Global health governance {GHG} is a set of formal and informal processes, operating beyond state boundaries, through which actors participate in steering, coordinating, and financing collective action on health and disease in populations around the world (Dodgson et al. 2002; Lee and Kamradt-Scott 2014; Ng and Ruger 2011) . As a concept, GHG is used both analytically and normatively, referring to processes for health governance in a globalized world, global institutions' impact on health and its determinants, and arrangements for collectively establishing and meeting global health goals . As a system, GHG comprises actors broadly categorized as public/private, state/non-state, or with old/new status, such as: UN agencies, public-private partnerships, philanthropic foundations, NGOs, development banks, think tanks, academic institutions, and governments (Youde 2012; Harman 2012; Clinton and Sridhar 2017a) . However, within this evolving GHG scenery wherein non-state and private actors have gained prominence (Hoffman et al. 2015; Ng and Ruger 2011; Szlezak et al. 2010) , Ricci (2009) notes that the role of the state has been underemphasized in the contemporary literature.",

Even within the mosaic of funding from new, non-traditional donors (Sch\u00e4ferhoff et al. 2014; Harman and Williams 2014) , 73% of official development assistance for health is from states (Moon and Omole 2017) . But the state has a critical role to play as a global health governor, beyond that as a global health financier. Schrecker (2012) warns that confining our focus on complex institution building at the global level deters much needed attention from the policy processes and agency of state actors and national governments. The role of the state should not be understood as one that is diminishing relative to that of other actors in the GHG system, but rather it should be understood with regard to its interactions with other actors in the system (Dodgson et al. 2002; Ricci 2009; Davies 2010; Sandberg et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "National policies on global health {NPGH} are public policies on global health matters involving collaboration between health and foreign affairs ministries. Switzerland's Swiss Health Foreign Policy (2019 , 2006 has been identified as the first example of an inter-ministerial agreement adopted on objectives for a national global health strategy (Kickbusch et al. 2007) . Other examples include the U.K.'s Health is global: UK Government Strategy (2008) , the Norwegian White Paper on Global health in foreign and development policy (2012), Germany's Shaping global health -taking joint action -embracing responsibility (2013), Japan's Global Health Policy (Okada 2010) , and France's Strategy for Global Health (2017) . Descriptions of these global health strategy documents underscore the disposition of diplomacy and policy formulation to integrate heath and foreign policy in multisectoral arrangements for global health at the national level (Kanth et al. 2013; Hein and Kickbusch 2012; Kickbusch et al. 2007 ), but little is known about how these interact with processes in the GHG system at large outside of global health diplomacy instruments and practices (Ruckert et al. 2016; Kickbusch 2013 ). Yet, there is nascent knowledge about policy processes to develop such documents (Gagnon and Labonte 2013; Aluttis et al. 2015) . A comparison of the NPGH documents adopted in Norway and Switzerland showed that these policies target actors in the GHG system (Jones et al. 2017b) . NPGH arenas are multisectoral governing arrangements wherein actors from health, development, and foreign affairs sectors interact in policy action situations to make decisions about the government's work in global health and its governance (Jones et al. 2017a ). Various rules-in-use by actors for micro-processes (e.g. coordination, information sharing, and negotiation) within NPGH arenas establish ranks and relationships of power between different policy sectors interacting on behalf of the state in global health. For example, the rules in the Norwegian NPGH action arena designated a leading role to the foreign affairs sector and a supporting one to the health sector, except in matters concerning WHO affairs (see Appendix A in supplementary material). Alternatively, the Swiss NPGH arena depended on a core group of four sectors that share power in decision-making, with public health as a linking sector between them (see Appendix B in supplementary material).",

The problem is that these relationships may be invisible to global health policy practitioners, in particular when these relationships are built through the involvement of actors from policy sectors other than their own. This relational problem is central to polycentric governance of global health (or other policy regimes of global scope like climate change) because policy development and action at one level may not be independent of a combination of influences (cooperation or competition) from others (Tosun 2017; Gautier et al. 2018 ). Knowledge about potential interdependencies between global/foreign and national/ domestic public policy processes pertaining to GHG may benefit policy scholars and practitioners to learn how national policy-makers from different sectors engage in GHG and where are the interfaces between GHG and national-level decision-making on state action in global health. Based on two in-depth case studies of Norwegian and Swiss NPGH arenas, this paper aims to explore the relationship between processes at national and global decision-making levels on matters of global health.",

Thus, our conceptual framework for this study, based on Real-Dato's synthetic framework (Real-Dato 2009), positioned external mechanisms of policy change as a directional force from the global arena on to the national one (Jones et al. 2017a ). We used literature on how ideas affect policy change to inform our selection and understanding of potential mechanisms by which the global arena influences NPGH policy arenas (Campbell 2002; B\u00e9land 2009 ). Mechanisms are defined as relational concepts to understand how levels of NPGH and global arenas relate (Falleti and Lynch 2009) . We selected policy learning and networking as mechanisms because both suggest that the circulation of ideas and instruments between actors may explain processes for policy change and outcomes of policy change.",

Learning objectives reflect different kinds of change for doing policy: procedural (adjustments for organizational change), instrumental (lessons for programmatic change), or systemic (frameworks for paradigmatic change) (Bennett and Howlett 1992; May 1992 May , 1999 Howlett and Ramesh 2002; Hall 1993) . This literature also distinguishes intentional from reactive learning (Bennett and Howlett 1992) . For Hall (Hall 1993) learning is deliberate, by questioning previous policy successes or failures and learning from their consequences to adjust policy objectives and tools; whereas for Heclo [cited in (Howlett et al. 2009)] learning is stimulated by the social context and policy environment, which incites a process to adapt and respond to external shifts.",

Based on similar studies (Gagnon and Labonte 2013; Aluttis et al. 2015) , we intended to recruit approximately 15 informants per case, including actors from the foreign affairs, health and development policy sectors. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 informants from Norway and 14 from Switzerland between November 2014 and October 2015 (see Table 1 ). We asked informants about intersectoral policy situations and decisionmaking processes for NPGH during the period 2006-2012 before the formal adoption of policy documents. In addition to questions about how actors worked together in policy situations, we asked about influences on processes to develop NPGH, and specifically, whether anything from outside of the respective countries exerted influence (i.e. If so, what? Where from? Who or which process contributed it? How was it used?). A diagramming technique for graphic elicitation was used in the face-to-face interviews. With one exception, interviews were recorded (36+ hours of audio) and transcribed verbatim (543 pages of transcripts). Each case was analyzed separately to produce two monographs (see summaries in supplementary material). 1",

Mechanisms of policy change are non-deterministic relational concepts because they are mobile and work differently in different contexts (Falleti and Lynch 2009) . Because the study defines policy context as a composite of physical environment and ideational elements, context includes the social, scientific/technical, and political fabric within which actors work. As such, contexts are elements of NPGH arenas, but they also span across boundaries of sovereign jurisdictions and geographical national borders. This has two implications for analysis: we did not analyze outcomes of mechanisms operating in the cases, and we looked for mechanisms of learning and networking in contexts that were relevant from informants' perspectives for understanding their government's work in global health, whether inside or outside the national arena.",

We use an interpretive schema of interaction to explore the zones that connected national and global level actors where learning or networking mechanisms operate. We examined the resources (e.g. knowledge, programs, networks, frameworks) from outside the NPGH arenas reflecting on their provenance, their proponents, and their prioritization. We also recognized learning when resources were linked to experiences and lessons for modifying policy practices. We highlighted data pointing to significant international meetings, institutions, initiatives, and partnerships in which informants signaled participation of actors from their NPGH arena.",

Mandated with international authority on health, WHO is the most representative mura et al. 2013; van der Rijt and Pang 2015; Eckl 2017) , but little about the EB. Similar to previous studies (Gagnon and Labonte 2013; Aluttis et al. 2015) , our findings suggest that learning processes related to EB terms [F1] are common in cases of global health strategies in the literature. In spite of sub-optimal governing practices in public-private partnerships for health (Buse and Harmer 2007) , public-private institutional forms of interaction [F2] have been shown to offer members commensurate access to information from the secretariat and to have accountability policies for monitoring (Clinton and Sridhar 2017b; Sridhar and Woods 2013) , which have been shown to be lacking in WHO (Eccleston-Turner and McArdle 2017; Clinton and Sridhar 2017a) . Non-institutional forms of interaction [F3, F4, F5] include both formal and informal types. We found that among interactions involving state actors [F1, F3] , those taking place in smaller transgovernmental clubs were significant because they are established on trust between participants, and thus clubs [F3] should not be neglected among state actors as an interactive form with implications for GHG. Research has previously highlighted formal diplomatic clubs (e.g. G7/8, BRICS bloc) as forms of interaction between national and international spheres with opportunities to exchange learning for GHG between members (Kirton et al. 2007; Harmer et al. 2013; Harmer and Buse 2014) . In contrast to formal arrangements between governments, literature on informal ones [F3] is scarce. Sandberg and colleagues (2016) found the FPGH quasi-formal club practiced diplomacy as \"complex relationship management outside of institutions\" that \"revitalizes the role of states\" in GHG. In the UK and German cases, similar arrangements were mentioned for developing their strategies, such as the UK's special relationship with the USA (Gagnon and Labonte 2013) , and German actors' interactions with OECD countries during the WHA and with UN agencies in Geneva (Aluttis et al. 2015) .",

Connective forms [F4, F5] are ontologically different from other structures in our findings, and they are rarely discussed in these terms in GHG literature. Both cities [F4] and transnational knowledge elites [F5] were forms of interactions important for consolidating learning and networking from institutional forms [F1, F2] . Boundary spanning, a term from organizational science and administration, generally refers to practices for reaching across diverse structural divisions to benefit inter-organizational collaboration and improve complex problem management. Researchers and practitioners have argued that global health practice needs boundary-spanning approaches to work more inclusively across contexts and structures (e.g. professional, sectoral, geographical) (Sheikh et al. 2016) . In our findings, we refer to boundary spanning [F5] as a form of interaction via the work of senior transnational knowledge elites whose global health careers produced extensive personal and professional networks world-wide. They are skilled networkers and strategists (not necessarily working in government), dedicated \"reticulists\" and \"entrepreneurs of power\" (Williams 2002) with vast international experience and thick address books, who broker learning and relationships between policy-makers, funders, institutions, and epistemic communities. State actors in NPGH arenas use boundary spanning transnational knowledge elites to help them analyze and navigate the complexity of the GHG system [F5] . Through meta-networking, these elites link salient learning and relationship-building from diverse interactions in translational spaces back to politicians and policy practitioners in national institutions.",

(2014) who empirically define GHG as a \"process of change and adaptation and as an arena where actors, institutions, and ideas interact\". Interactions between state and non-state actors from different levels of policy and governance are characteristic of the transnationalization of public policy (Stone 2004) . Transnationalization pertains to relationships between actors and sectors functioning outside the traditional frameworks of international relations, and it refers to frames of reference (e.g. policy regimes, networks) relating social and geographic spaces across multiple localities, diverging from ideas of national and global spaces as concentric spheres (Pries 2009 ). While our results focus on forms of interaction, exploring the transnational nature of NPGH arenas calls for a discussion of agents in interactions. Stone identifies three types of \"transnational policy community\" individuals who circulate ideas, procedures, and instruments (Stone 2008) . The \"internationalized public sector official\" operates in institutions and networks [F1, F2, F3, F4] based on authority from their official positions within their state. The \"international civil servant\" works in the secretariat of international organizations and global public-private partnerships [F1, F2, F4]. The \"transnational policy professionals\" are policy and practice pundits (i.e. consultant, foundation officer, scientific expert, NGO executive) [F2, F4, F5] . Transnational policy professionals impact the circulation of policy learning through networks and modify the geographies of governance (Prince 2012; Marx et al. 2012) . The boundary spanning transnational knowledge elites identified in our two cases [F5] are a hybrid combination of all three types of individuals in the transnational policy community for global health due to their careers. We would add to Stone's categories that of the \"transnational capital class\" of corporate elites (Carroll and Carson 2003) that interact with NPGH and the GHG system in global public-private partnerships and product development partnerships (i.e. pharmaceutical industry) [F2, F4] (see (Rushton and Williams 2011; Kenworthy et al. 2016 ) for examples).",

Transnational interactions contribute to reaffirming state actors as intrinsic to the system. States with NPGH arenas receive recognition as integral actors in the GHG system, beyond institutional membership or donor status. The intersectoral collaboration developed within NPGH arenas aims to improve state influence in the transnational arena for GHG. Indeed, networks across state institutions and the reconfiguration of responsibilities of state agencies to include governance of issues at the international level are examples of how global governance transforms internal governance arrangements (e.g. NPGH) to perform GHG as part of the domestic arena (Hameiri and Jones 2015) . Based on cases of NPGH in select high-income countries, the domestic resources for such transformations to construct NPGH arenas are not likely afforded by lower-middle or low-income countries. Furthermore, actors from these countries may be excluded from informal elite networking processes in transgovernmental and connective forms of interaction unless those forms actively build capacity for equitable representation and inclusive participation supported by skills for global health diplomacy and health in foreign policy (Adisasmito et al. 2019) .",

            "text": "The exclusion of other mechanisms of policy change, such as conflict expansion and venue shopping, are limits to the study's findings regarding forms of interaction. These types of mechanisms affect change in public policy (often in agenda-setting processes) through framing strategies to modify a policy image in order to render the policy issue more appealing or meaningful to different audiences or to propose different instruments for addressing it. We excluded these mechanisms because they are generally associated with the global governance of particular health or disease issues (i.e. HIV/AIDS, pandemics, antimicrobial resistance). Related to this point, global issues networks were absent from our data and results. Such networks have been shown to be influential in advocating issues for global health policy and practice, including helping raise political priorities McDougall 2016; Smith and Shiffman 2016) . Our observations about boundary spanning networking practices that operate at the intersections of GHG hubs and the personal networks of transnational elites from national arenas might explain why such formal global health networks are absent. These networks may represent other forms of interaction between national and global processes governing global health. However, given the focus of our study on cases of the intersectoral NPGH arena, such interactions with issue networks may be either via national civil society organizations who are observers in NPGH, through sectoral arrangements specific to health institutes or subordinate agencies, or in intersectoral arrangements at the programmatic/operational level (rather than policy governance/collective choice level). The interaction and power rules-in-use for the policy action situations in each case determined the status of civil society organizations, non-governmental organizations and academics in the NPGH arenas in Norway and Switzerland (see Appendices A and B in supplementary material). We interviewed key informants mainly from government sectors in the policy arena, as they were represented and involved in multiple action situations. This focus on actors from government policy sectors may have limited critical perspectives collected from informants on the policy process.",

The formal and informal interactions between NPGH arenas and GHG construct an interdependent relationship between the policy processes within NPGH arenas and GHG system. These ties are formed through the circulation of ideas in policy learning and networking processes between state and non-state actors in institutions and networks. Thus, NPGH arenas appear to have fuzzy boundaries as a policy process, with their borders drawn by extent and type of their interactions with the GHG system. Based on these findings, the characterization of NPGH arenas as transnational governance of global health introduces a nuanced perspective to understand intersectoral governance arrangements of states as actors of GHG.",

At the same time Jens Stoltenberg's appointment to GAVI's board (2001-2005) was facilitated. So when Stoltenberg became the Prime Minister (again in 2005), he had been a GAVI board member, bringing that sphere with him and all the low-hanging fruits of success from putting money into vaccines for saving children. Norwegian informant (FA) The involvement of Norwegian politicians in the governance of global health initiatives like GAVI connected policy learning directly to the political context of the Norwegian arena. Using elite networking to help place Norwegian politicians (i.e. Jens Stoltenberg and Dagfinn H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten) into such roles also supported policy learning useful for them in Norway. H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten, elected as a Board member of GAVI in 2006 (replacing Stoltenberg who became Prime Minister in 2005), was Chair of the GAVI Board from 2011-2015 during which time he was also a member of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Standing Committee from 2006-2013 and its spokesperson for the public hearing and committee's opinion on the White Paper in the Norwegian arena.",
