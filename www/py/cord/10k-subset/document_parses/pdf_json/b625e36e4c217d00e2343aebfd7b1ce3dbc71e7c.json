Our experience with the two cases reported here has led us to propose guidelines for the treatment of initial PTE in a pediatric hematology unit. Two children with leukemia developed PTE, the first during the relapse for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the second at the onset of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In both cases, the diagnosis of PTE was based on clinical assessment of sudden acute respiratory failure with positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy in spite of a negative chest X-ray. The subintensive supervision consisted of instrumental monitoring with the assistance of an intensive care anesthetist. The clinical monitoring was based on the serial registration of respiratory rate, cardiac rate, SaO 2 and body temperature. The thrombolytic therapy, together with heparin prophylaxis, was successfully administered in the hematology ward without the need for intensive care support (i.e. mechanical ventilation). The success of the treatment was documented by the criterion of a return to the normal cardiorespiratory parameters a few hours after the start of the thrombolytic treatment. Furthermore, a chest CT scan in case 1 and an arteriography in case 2 confirmed the PTE-related hypoperfusion. On the basis of this experience, the authors point out that in the course of acute respiratory failure in leukemic children, the combination of a negative chest Xray and a positive pulmonary perfusional scintigraphy (compared whenever possible with ventilatory scintigraphy) in the presence of a negative CT scan could be a reliable diagnostic tool for PTE. This pathology should be treated promptly and with specific therapy to avoid progression to a severe, massive PTE.",

Particular attention must be paid to CVC-related thrombosis such as deep venous thrombosis or PTE. In fact, this occurs when the CVC is not functioning very well, as in our case 1; an endothelial cell injury can also occur as a result of the nature of the chemotherapy administered. Our previous experience indicated that the prognosis in PTE becomes more favorable the earlier the diagnosis is made and therapy with fibrinolytics started. In fact, as shown by other authors, late diagnosis when there is severe lung embolism invariably leads to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often to the death of the patient [16, 20, 26, 27] .",

Lack of opacity in the chest CT, which is more detailed than the standard chest X-ray, confirms the thromboembolic origin of the perfusional scintigraphy images.",

Prospective studies will be necessary to determine whether helical CT can be offered as an alternative to comparative ventilatory and perfusion scintigraphy as the primary screening modality for acute thromboembolic disease. Despite all its advantages, helical CT may not replace angiography entirely, but it may modify the use of angiography in many patients.",
