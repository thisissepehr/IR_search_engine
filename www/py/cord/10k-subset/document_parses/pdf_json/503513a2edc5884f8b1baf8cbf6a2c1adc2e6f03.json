These values were not significantly different from each other (by ANO-VA). Inhaled NO produced a significant decrease in Rrs of greater than 4 times the coefficient of variation of the baseline measurement in 3 of 12 patients. Seven of 12 patients had no significant change while two patients had a significant increase in Rrs. Inhaled salbutamol produced a significant decrease in Rrs in 5 of 11 patients, while 6 showed no change in Rrs. Conclusion: Inhaled NO has no apparent bronchodilator effect in the majority of acutely ill infants with RSV bronchiolitis and does not appear to provide any additional benefit over the use of salbutamol. The clinical benefit of inhaled NO as a bronchodilator is questionable under these conditions. Various modalities of therapy have been used to treat the airway obstruction in RSV bronchiolitis, although only a few formal studies have been carried out in intubated infants during the very acute stage of the disease [6, 7] . The usefulness of inhaled b 2 -adrenergic drugs, such as salbutamol, remains controversial, because many infants do not respond with a clinically significant improvement and, in those responding, the measurable effect on bronchodilatation is modest at best. There is evidence that combined b -and a-agonists (e. g. adrenaline) are more effective, because of their additional vasoconstrictor effects, which decrease bronchial mucosal edema and hence airflow obstruction [8, 9] . However, all these drugs increase total body oxygen consumption, minute ventilation and energy requirement by their direct or indirect effects on other organs through b -receptor stimulation [10] . Thus, bronchodilators that do not increase the resting energy expenditure should be preferred in critically ill infants with respiratory compromise, especially if the expected improvement in respiratory function is small.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1030, "end": 1033, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1036, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1511, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1514, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1708, "end": 1712, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Nitric oxide (NO), recently identified as endothelium-derived relaxing factor [11] , causes relaxation in a variety of vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle cells.

Hogman and colleagues found only a weak bronchodilatation in response to inhaled NO at 80 ppm in a group of ten adults with asthma, and questioned whether inhaled NO would find clinical application in the treatment of asthma [15] .

The former would be unlikely to respond to bronchodilators. Moreover, it seems that NO exerts its bronchodilator effect primarily on the central airways and less on the small airways [18, 27] , which are the major region of airway obstruction in bronchiolitis. In addition, it could be argued that any benefit NO had in decreasing Rrs was opposed by the small amounts of NO 2 which occur as a metabolite of NO. NO 2 is a known airway irritant, but without direct effects on pulmonary mechanics in healthy humans at levels below 1.0 ppm [28] . Strong bronchodilator effects of inhaled NO were described in several animal models despite the presence of NO 2 at levels between 0.4 ppm 85 [16, 18] . If this data holds true for humans, it implies that the presence of NO 2 does not account for the weak bronchodilator effect of NO in our study, since NO 2 never exceeded a level of 0.5 ppm. Current medical therapies aimed at reducing airway resistance in infants with acute RSV bronchiolitis are of questionable benefit. Although inhaled b 2 -adrenergic drugs, such as salbutamol, are widely used in this condition, there have been few formal efforts to measure objectively the bronchodilator response in infants with RSV-induced respiratory failure. In a previous study, we found that inhaled salbutamol was of limited value as a bronchodilator under these circumstances [6] , and we cautioned against the uncritical application of b 2 -adrenergic drugs, because of the side effects upon oxygen consumption and the subsequent increase in energy requirements in compromised infants [10] . Although salbutamol seemed to be superior to inhaled NO in this study, it did not result in a significant improvement in Rrs in most study patients. Again, the airway obstruction in acute RSV bronchiolitis is mainly the result of mucus plugs and cellular debris from bronchiolar inflammation and epithelial necrosis. The contribution of airway smooth muscle constriction and virus-induced hyperresponsiveness to the airway obstruction is probably minor in the acute stage of the disease. This explains why bronchodilators are much less effective in acute bronchiolitis than in asthma. Adrenaline with its vasoconstrictor effect may have an advantage over salbutamol, but this has never been studied in critically ill and ventilated infants [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 479, "end": 483, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 484, "end": 487, "text": "27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 832, "end": 836, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 981, "end": 985, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 986, "end": 989, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1668, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1879, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2622, "end": 2625, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "One limitation of our study is the small number of infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis who could be in-cluded in our study.
