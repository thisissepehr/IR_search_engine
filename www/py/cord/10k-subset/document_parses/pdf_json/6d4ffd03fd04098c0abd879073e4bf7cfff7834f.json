            "text": "The question of whether influenza is transmitted to a significant degree by aerosols remains controversial, in part, because little is known about the quantity and size of potentially infectious airborne particles produced by people with influenza. In this study, the size and amount of aerosol particles produced by nine subjects during coughing were measured while they had influenza and after they had recovered, using a laser aerosol particle spectrometer with a size range of 0.35 to 10 \u00b5m. Individuals with influenza produce a significantly greater volume of aerosol when ill compared with afterward (p = 0.0143). When the patients had influenza, their average cough aerosol volume was 38.3 picoliters (pL) of particles per cough (SD 43.7) ; after patients recovered, the average volume was 26.4 pL per cough (SD 45.6) . The number of particles produced per cough was also higher when subjects had influenza (average 75,400 particles/cough, SD 97,300) compared with afterward (average 52,200, SD 98,600), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1042). The average number of particles expelled per cough varied widely from patient to patient, ranging from 900 to 302,200 particles/cough while subjects had influenza and 1100 to 308,600 particles/cough after recovery. When the subjects had influenza, an average of 63% of each subject's cough aerosol particle volume in the detection range was in the respirable size fraction (SD 22%), indicating that these particles could reach the alveolar region of the lungs if inhaled by another person. This enhancement in aerosol generation during illness may play an important role in influenza transmission and suggests that a better understanding of this phenomenon is needed to predict the production and dissemination of influenza-laden aerosols by people infected with this virus.",

            "text": "I nfluenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease that is of great concern to the public health community because of the annual burden from the illness and the possibility of a severe pandemic with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Influenza is thought to be spread by direct person-toperson transfer of infectious secretions, by indirect transfer of secretions via fomites, by large ballistic spray droplets that are produced during coughing or sneezing and splash onto mucous membranes, and by the inhalation and deposition of airborne virus-laden particles. (1) However, the relative importance of these routes of transmission is unclear and appears to depend on multiple factors, including temperature and humidity, the virus concentration in respiratory secretions, the distance from the source to the recipient, and the genotype of the virus. (2, 3) The possibility of airborne transmission in particular is hotly debated, with some studies suggesting that this pathway plays a critical role in the spread of influenza (1, 4) while others concluding that it does not. (5) This controversy had a direct impact on public health policy during the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza pandemic; some health care institutes such as the U.S. Institute of Medicine recommended that health care workers in close contact with influenza patients wear respirators to prevent possible airborne transmission, (6) while other organizations such as the World Health Organization did not. (7) Disagreement over the potential for the airborne transmission of influenza occurs in part because the quantity and size of potentially infectious aerosols produced by people with influenza have not been well characterized. Several studies have examined aerosol particle generation by people during coughing, speaking, sneezing, and breathing (reviewed by Gralton (8) and Nicas (9) ). Most of these studies used healthy subjects, but a few have looked at aerosol production by individuals with respiratory viral infections, including influenza (10) (11) (12) and rhinovirus. (10, 13) All of these studies have consistently found a tremendous variation in the numbers of aerosol particles expelled by individuals. Edwards et al. (14) tested 11 healthy subjects and reported that the concentration of particles in their exhaled breath varied from 1 particle/liter to over 10,000 particles/liter. Fabian et al. (11) tested 10 patients with influenza and found that the concentration of particles exhaled by these subjects ranged from 67 to 8500 particles/liter of air; similar results were later reported for patients with rhinovirus infections. (13) Almstrand et al. (15) also found that the exhaled particle concentrations varied considerably from subject to subject and with the depth of breathing, but that the exhaled concentrations for each subject were fairly consistent during repeated testing for each respiratory maneuver studied.",

            "text": "Although these papers and others have added considerably to the body of knowledge about respiratory aerosol production, one important question that remains unanswered is how respiratory infections affect aerosol particle production by patients. Because respiratory infections generally increase airway mucus production, it is typically assumed that aerosol production also increases, but the actual amount of any change is unknown, and it is also unclear whether the particle size or distribution of the aerosol is shifted. The studies cited above that looked at particle production in individuals with respiratory infections also included healthy individuals in some cases, but because of the large interpersonal variability in aerosol production, it is impossible to know if any differences observed are due to illness or other factors. This study measured aerosol particle production during coughing by patients while they had an active influenza infection, and then measured cough aerosol production by these same patients after they had recovered. By performing the first direct comparison of respiratory aerosol production during and after illness, these results show more clearly how influenza affects aerosol generation. A better understanding of the effects of influenza on aerosol production will help with efforts to study the potential for the airborne transmission of this illness and to devise interventions to reduce its spread.",

The cough aerosol collection chamber was fitted with an inlet port for the spirometer and two outlets. A Wide-Range Particle Spectrometer (WPS) (Model M1000XP; MSP Corporation, Shoreview, Minn.) was connected to the chamber to analyze the cough aerosols. The WPS includes a laser particle spectrometer (LPS) to measure larger aerosol particles and a differential mobility analyzer-condensation particle counter (DMA-CPC) to measure smaller particles. According to the manufacturer, the LPS detection range is 0 to 500,000 particles/liter, while the DMA-CPC detection range is 20,000 to 10 10 particles/liter. Most of the cough particle concentrations were below the detection limit of the DMA-CPC, and thus, only the LPS data are reported here. A 32-L/min air pump (Model 1532; Gast Manufacturing, Benton Harbor, Mich.) was also connected to the chamber to remove particles from it between tests. ",

The number of particles generated ranged from a low of 400 particles/cough to a high of 516,800 particles/cough while subjects had an influenza infection, and 300 to 362,700 particles/cough after recovery. These results are consistent with those reported by others; virtually all studies of human aerosol particle generation that have compared subjects have found tremendous person-to-person variation. (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) This phenomenon may lead to a \"superspreader\" effect; that is, if some people produce much greater quantities of infectious aerosols, they may be much more likely to spread influenza to others. (9, 18) The cough aerosol particle volume also varied greatly from patient to patient; the average aerosol volumes ranged from 2.4 to 144 pL/cough when ill and 0.5 to 145 pL/cough after recovery. Interestingly, the ratio of cough aerosol volume when sick to the volume after recovery was more consistent; this ratio was always between 0.99 and 5.23 and had an average of 2.77 (SD 1.55). Thus, even though the absolute volume of aerosol coughed out by the patients varied greatly, the change in cough aerosol volume due to influenza for a given patient was more predictable. This was also true for the aerosol volume per liter of cough; in this case, the ratio ranged from 1.08 to 6.95, with an average of 2.79 (SD 1.87).",

Cough aerosols have a much broader size range (8, 9) than was covered by our instrument (0.35 to 10 \u00b5m), and thus our data do not mean that 63% of the entire cough aerosol was in the respirable fraction.",

It is also interesting to compare this result with other reports of the sizes of influenza-laden airborne particles; a study of cough aerosols collected from influenza patients found that 65% of the influenza virus RNA was contained in particles in the respirable size fraction, (12) and two previous studies of airborne particles in a hospital emergency department (20) and an urgent care clinic (21) found that 53% and 42% of the influenza virus RNA was in particles in the respirable size fraction. Taken together, these studies all suggest that a substantial portion of the airborne particles containing influenza that are expelled by patients are in the respirable size range and support the hypothesis that influenza could in fact be transmitted by the airborne route.",

(22) (23) (24) The primary reason for this is likely because these authors included much larger particles in their measurements (up to 2 mm for one study). (23) Since a 2-mm particle has a volume that is 10 9 greater than a 2-\u00b5m particle, a small number of large particles can have a tremendous impact on the measurement of the total volume expelled. These larger drops fall very quickly (in fact, they were usually collected onto nearby settling plates during the experiments), while smaller droplets are capable of remaining airborne for an extended period. Thus, these results also illustrate the critical role of particle size in airborne disease transmission. At close range, larger drops can be important because of their greater volume and subsequent pathogen content, but as one moves farther away from an infected person, smaller particles may gradually become more important because they are able to stay airborne longer, reach more people, and are more easily inhaled.",

The participants were young, ambulatory, otherwise healthy adults, and thus their results may not be representative of a broader and more diverse population. The number of subjects was small, which may be important given the large personto-person variation seen in aerosol production. Our subjects were all symptomatic at the time of initial testing, but they were likely at different stages of their illness and some were more ill than others; both of these factors may influence aerosol production. Aerosol particles toward the upper limit of the WPS (10 \u00b5m) were more likely than small ones to deposit by impaction or settling before detection and thus may have been undercounted in our cough aerosol measurement system. Finally, it is not known how much influenza virus was contained in the airborne particles, how the influenza virus content varies with particle size, or how the amount of virus in each particle changes over the course of the illness.",

However, many questions remain about the likelihood of the transmission of influenza from person to person by the airborne route. Our study shows for the first time that individuals with influenza cough out a greater volume of aerosol particles than they do when they are healthy. Further, many of these particles are in the respirable size fraction and thus can be easily inhaled and drawn down into the deepest parts of the lungs where they may be more likely to cause an infection. This enhancement in aerosol generation may play an important role in influenza transmission and suggests that a better understanding of this phenomenon is needed to predict the production and dissemination of influenza-laden aerosols by people infected with this virus.",
