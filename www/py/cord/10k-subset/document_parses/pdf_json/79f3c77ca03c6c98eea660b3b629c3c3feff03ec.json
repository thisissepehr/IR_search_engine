Broadly, tissue regeneration is achieved by proliferation of common differentiated cells and/or by deployment of specialized stem/progenitor cells, which has been applied in some studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . After lung damage, adult lung tissue has a remarkable capacity for regeneration, owing to a few facultative stem/progenitor cell populations that become activated in response to tissue damage [11, 12] . The distal airway stem/progenitor cells (DASCs) expressing basal cell-restricted transcription factor p63 and keratin-5 (KRT5) have been shown to have potent regenerative capacity after lung injury [13] [14] [15] [16] . Influenzainduced lung injury activated DASCs to proliferate and migrate widely to occupy heavily injured areas, whereupon they differentiate toward mature epithelium and the regeneration of injured tissue depending on the extent of injury [14] . The feasibility for large-scale in vitro expansion and remarkable lung engraftment after transplantation make DASC an ideal candidate for cell therapy [15, 17] .",

The lung was inflated with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma, USA) using a 30-G needle through the trachea. Then the lung was dissected and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde at 4\u00b0C overnight before paraffin section or cryosection. For cryosection, the fixed lung was settled by 30% sucrose before embedding into the Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound (Sakura, Japan), solidified on dry ice, and cut using a cryotome (Leica Microsystems, Germany) of 5-10-\u03bcm thickness. For the paraffin section, the lung was dehydrated by gradient ethanol in an automatic tissue processer (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and then embedded into paraffin blocks. The blocks were cut into 5~7-\u03bcm thickness by using a microtome (Leica Microsystems, Germany) at distinct planes. The sections were placed on poly-lysine-coated glass slides and stored at room temperature until further use. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome staining was performed following the standard protocol. The severity of fibrosis in H&E-stained lungs was quantified by the Ashcroft scoring system [18] , and the blue-stained area (an indication of quantity of collagen deposition) was separately quantified by ImageJ version 1.52a (National Institutes of Health, USA).",

Fibrosis is fully developed with extensive and diffuse involvement of the lung at 21 days. In contrast, pulmonary fibrosis tended to decrease and the lesions were significantly attenuated when administrated with mDASCs (Fig. 4b) . Masson's trichrome staining of lung tissue (Fig. 4c) showed that more prominent blue staining, which represents mature collagen, was distributed in the alveolar septa or interstitial and peribronchial connective tissue in the bleomycin-injured lung without mDASC transplantation than that in the lung with mDASC transplantation (Fig. 4d) . These findings support that engraftment of mDASCs 7 days after bleomycin instillation protected pulmonary fibrosis on days 14 and 21.",

Endogenous adult lung stem cells are important for epithelial cell homeostasis and injury repair which have attracted significant interest. Numerous studies of human and animal lung have identified subsets of lung epithelial cells that could respond to lung injury with self-renewal and differentiation capacity, including basal cells, club cells, and AECII cells of the alveoli [12, 22, 23] . Moreover, advanced lineage tracing techniques have suggested that most types of lung epithelial cells can proliferate and expand after injury to promote lung repair [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .

As expected, we observed the proliferating endogenous mDASCs p63/Krt5 in the damage lung in bleomycin-induced lung injury mice, which were hard to find in the healthy lung. Different animal models have been developed to investigate key mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and identify potential therapeutic targets. The most common pulmonary fibrosis model involves exposure to bleomycin, and several studies reported that administration of bleomycin to the lung causes pulmonary injury and inflammation, and then a chronic fibrotic process develops [30] [31] [32] , which is characterized by replacement of extracellular matrix by fibrillary collagen and collagen-producing myofibroblasts [33] . Our findings showed that bleomycin induced a significant acute lung injury in 7 days and then caused obvious fibrosis in day 21. Therefore, these findings were consistent with the previous studies. The mDASCs were applied in the acute injury stage. In our experiments, we observed large-scale incorporation of transplanted mDASCs into mouse lung. The engrafted mDASCs differentiated into alveolar-like structure in 21 days, and a fraction of them expressed type I pneumocyte markers but not the type II pneumocyte marker. However, Zuo et al. reported that mDASCs expressed type I and type II pneumocyte markers 40 days after virus infection [15] , and Vaughan et al. also found that~1/3 of the Krt5+ cells resolved into type II pneumocytes 50 days after bleomycin injury [14] . The difference of differentiation time of transplanted mDASCs in animals between our experiment and theirs maybe the main cause. Together, these findings demonstrated that the mDASCs could incorporate, proliferate, and differentiate into type I pneumocyte cells which indicated the participation of regeneration and reparation following lung injury.",
