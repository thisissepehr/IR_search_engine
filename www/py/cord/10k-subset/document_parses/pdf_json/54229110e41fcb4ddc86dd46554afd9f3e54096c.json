The Think Tank was a historic gathering of public health experts and health system stakeholders who were brought together to discuss the necessary steps to improve Canada's public health system. The meeting was prompted by the increasing concern for the state of Canada's public health system infrastructure. The system's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies, as well as the ongoing public health challenges facing Canadians have been questioned. 1,2 A federal/provincial/territorial assessment of public health system capacity reported in 2001 that the system had experienced a loss of resources resulting in widespread concern for the resiliency of the system infrastructure to respond consistently and proactively to the demands placed upon it. 3 The recent experience with SARS has further intensified such concerns.",

As a whole, Canadians are healthier than ever before, but there continue to be major inequalities/disparities in health status between population groups. Inequalities have their roots in the social, economic, cultural, and environmental determinants of health. For example, mortality rates vary considerably among provinces and territories, across socio-economic groups, and substantial differences are observed between Aboriginal populations and the rest of Canadians. The public health challenges facing Canada include new and emerging communicable disease threats such as SARS and West Nile Virus, while at the same time, old foes have not disappeared (e.g., HIV, tuberculosis, community water-borne disease outbreaks). Communicable diseases are currently receiving substantial attention, but chronic diseases and injuries are the leading causes of death and disability for all age groups and today's public health challenges include epidemic numbers of obese adults and children, continued high smoking rates -especially in particular regions and among certain segments of the population -and increasing rates of asthma in children.",

Smaller provinces were more likely than larger ones to have discontinued or reduced health surveillance, health promotion, disease and injury prevention, and health protection programs. The vast majority (36 of 37) of key informants from outside the public health system* stated that Canada did not have a very integrated and effective public health system. Resources in many areas had been curtailed, diverted or not replenished in line with ongoing and emerging requirements. There was widespread concern expressed about the resiliency of the public health infrastructure and the ability of the system to respond consistently and proactively to the demands placed upon it. There were significant disparities between \"have\" and \"have not\" provinces and regions in their capacity to address public health problems. In addition, the resources to deliver comprehensive, high quality public health programs and services do not appear to be evenly distributed across Canada. The capacity report's findings were consistent with previous assessments of the public health system by the Krever Commission 7 and the Auditor General of Canada. 8",

Others present suggested that Canada already has a surfeit of such very ambitious multi-sectoral policy documents, and that the background paper should indeed focus on \"strengthening essential public health services\" in order to have any chance of success.",
