Many factors may affect drug metabolism in infants, including higher total body water content and extracellular water content, higher unbound active fraction of drugs because of lower affinity of drugs to serum proteins, lower p450 enzyme activity, which could reduce or increase the cytotoxic effects, and lower renal clearance, which could increase systemic exposure of drugs because of reduced tubular and glomerular function until about 6 months of age. In addition, the ratio of body weight to body surface area is lower in infants than in older children. Therefore, if the doses are calculated based on the body surface area, the infants would be exposed to greater amounts of each drug.

Although the incidence of RSV infection is low among patients with AML, it is associated with high mortality in children with AML [21] , and it is well known that infants, both immunocompetent and immunocompromised, are particularly vulnerable to RSV. Although RSV infection may be prevented with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the RSV epitope, it was not approved for use in malignant disease in Japan until August 2013, so its use was at the physician's discretion. An aerosol formulation of the anti-viral agent ribavirin is also effective against RSV infection, but only oral agents have been approved in Japan.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 503, "end": 507, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "With these aforementioned amendments, most of the grade C3 non-hematological adverse events decreased, especially, clinically documented infections and pulmonary complications ( Table 4 ).

Although this reduction in early and non-relapse death led to achievement of [70 % pOS for the post-amendment cohort, improvements in pEFS and pOS were not statistically significant.
