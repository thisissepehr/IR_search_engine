At these relatively small geographic scales, short-distance interactions and tightly knit sub-networks dominate the dynamics of pathogen transmission; yet, the effective boundaries of these micro-scale groups are generally not known and often ignored. Using clinical test results from hospital admitted patients we analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) in the city of Jerusalem over a period of three winter seasons. We demonstrate that this urban area is not a single, perfectly mixed ecology, but is in fact comprised of a set of more basic, relatively independent pathogen transmission units, which we term here Local Transmission Zones, LTZs. By identifying these LTZs, and using the dynamic pathogencontent information contained within them, we are able to differentiate between disease-causes at the individual patient level often with near-perfect predictive accuracy.",

While the Influenza virus may cause ILI, there are many other respiratory diseases such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), ParaInfluenza, Adenovirus, and other pathogens that may be equally responsible 6-10 . Disease manifestations of ILI range across the spectrum from mild presentation to acute respiratory failure 11 . The spatio-temporal dynamics of the different pathogens that can lead to ILI, and their interactions, is an area of research for which little is known. Recent work has emphasized that transmission is tightly linked to the underlying structure of the host community: a complex, dynamic network of short-and long-distance social interactions. The long-distance interactions facilitate disease transmission over great geographic distances 12,13 , for example via international airplane routes, and can play an important role in controlling the global distribution and spread of ILI and pandemics 14, 15 .",

The effective boundaries of these micro-scale groups are generally not known, and it is difficult to determine which groups within a large community form a pathogen's basic 'epidemiological unit.' Moreover little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of ILI at these smaller spatial scales. Here we develop new methods that focus on the unexplored patterns and dynamics of ILI epidemics on these smaller scales by developing a new theory of 'Local Transmission Zones' (LTZs). We demonstrate how a single urban area can be subdivided into a set of smaller geographic zones, that are relatively independent of one another and each individually may be considered as a pathogen's basic epidemiological unit. The disease dynamics within the urban area cannot be fully understood without subdividing it into its subcomponent LTZs. Our study outlines a new approach for identifying LTZs and explores their properties with regard to pathogen transmission.",

However, an invading pathogen may have difficulty in spreading beyond the confines of the relatively isolated LTZ. Extreme examples of LTZs have been documented in the literature and include confined military bases or cruise ships [21] [22] [23] [24] or other small isolated communities (e.g. religious or ethnic) through which diseases rapidly propagate, reaching most members of the population.",

Using a 'k-means clustering' algorithm, putative LTZ groups are identified solely based on the physical distance between home locations of the patients. The methodology is akin to the procedure of 'community detection' applied in the study of complex networks and designed to locate highly connected clusters of nodes 25, 26 . Our analysis finds that while Influenza and RSV incidences tend to overlap and show more or less equal number of cases over the whole region, individual LTZs show a far more homogeneous disease content at most given times, with some being dominated by RSV while others by Influenza. We use these findings to arrive at a prediction algorithm that, applied to patients presenting at the hospital with ILI, is capable of differentiating between cases of Influenza and RSV, often with near-perfect accuracy.",

Note that when examined over the entire period , the spatial distributions of Influenza and RSV are very similar and we have found that the LTZs obtained using only the Influenza or RSV data for clustering purposes are very similar to those obtained when using the entire data (not shown). The clustering method used was effective at identifying geographically distinct areas as clusters, e.g. neighborhoods outside the Jerusalem municipal boundary (Fig. 1 , highlighted area). Here we chose k = 36 LTZ groups as a representative example because it guaranteed that the smallest LTZ consisted of at least 100 individuals. Interestingly, the clustering algorithm was also able to make meaningful distinctions within the municipal boundaries, e.g. between the 'Bet-Safafa' and 'Gilo' neighbourhoods (indicated on map as circles).",

In the 2009-10 season, we note the occurrence of first an Influenza epidemic followed by an RSV epidemic, with very small overlap between the two epidemics. As such there is a notable time-delay between the peaks of the epidemic curves of Influenza and that of RSV.

The underlying concept is that any pathogen arriving at a susceptible LTZ is able to spread rapidly through the entire local population. This domination within an LTZ is to be expected since disease transmission within an LTZ is stronger than transmission between them. Such a situation would be particularly favoured if only a limited number of infected individuals invade a susceptible but heterogeneous region. The pathogen dominating an LTZ is likely to be the first successfully invading pathogen. In this extreme case, there would be zero overlap of the diseases in any LTZ, because each LTZ has only a single pathogen. Here, our working assumption is that transmission between LTZs has relatively minor impact at these time-scales. Hence, even if at the whole region scale (i.e. k = 1) disease signal overlap is high, as say in 2010-11, in the individual LTZs within the region the disease signal overlap should be expected to be far smaller, ideally close to zero. This motivates us to develop a quantitative index for measuring disease Signal Overlap (SO). To do so, we let the number of Influenza and RSV cases at time t be represented by I(t) and R(t) respectively. Let \u03c1 I,R (\u03c4) be the lagged cross-correlation between I(t) and R(t \u2212 \u03c4), that is, the cross-correlation between the Influenza and RSV time series when there is a time-delay \u03c4 between the signals.

The social and spatial structures differ among cities, and Jerusalem may not be representative of any 'generic' city; e.g. it might be that in some areas the population connectivity pattern is far more homogenous, and hence the ability to leverage LTZ-based identification of a pathogen might be limited, or provide better results at other values of k. The \"optimal value\" of k will be the true number of LTZs in a given area, and for a given choice of pathogens, and as such is expected to vary. Unfortunately, there is no simple way of determining this optimal k in advance of the analysis, which is a key problem with many clustering algorithms and \"community detection\" network algorithms in particular 26 .",

Our aims however are quite different, since here our goal is to determine if a city-area (i.e. Jerusalem) is essentially a single, well-mixed ecology in terms of pathogen transmission, or if there are additional spatial partitions within this limited geographic scope.

This is also called the ratio of the cross correlation coefficients of the unnormalized vectors DS v1 (A, T) and DS v2 (A, T):, which is a quantity depending on the area in question (see Eq. 2, main text). The maximization over the time-shift \u0394 t is done in absolute value, i.e. we are maximizing the absolute value of the time-shifted cross correlation. In the context of the current paper v1 and v2 represent Influenza and RSV respectively. The resulting degree of signal overlap per a given period varies between \u2212 1 and 1, where 1 indicates DS v1 and DS v2 completely overlap (same frequency) and zero time shift, and a \u2212 1 score indicates anticorrelation and zero time shift. The overlap is calculated per period, in the results presented here, per 'winter season' , defined here as August year X to May year X + 1, that is three seasons in total: 2009-10, 2010-11, and 2011-12. Notice that our definition of the ratio in Eq. [5] is different from the usual cross correlation: a score of 1 implies two possibilities: 1. that the data is perfectly correlated at zero time shift or 2. that the data is perfectly correlated and periodic with some period \u0394 t.By dividing the whole region into k = \u2026k, we can compute the signal in Eq. [5] for each LTZ. This provides a more local way to analyze the correlations between diseases. The total signal is then the weighted sum of the signal of the individual LTZs with weight factors W i equal to the percentage population size N i of the i' th LTZ:We define the resulting overall signal overlap as a weighted sum over all LTZs that comprise the area analyzed. Given some (number n of) LTZs \u2026 \u2208 \u2026 i i k The signal overlap in each LTZ, and consequently the overall ratio in the whole region are bound between negative one -anticorrelation) and one (complete overlap).Disease signal ratios. We define the relative disease ratio DR of the incidence of two viruses using the following formula:The relative signal ratios are bound between a value of one (all cases are Influenza) and negative one (all cases are RSV) and are specific per time-period, here calculated per one week time periods; when the incidence of Influenza is equal to that of RSV the ratio is equal to zero.The per-season absolute |DR| values (presented in Fig. 3c) were calculated as the average of the absolute values of the per-week |DR| values; when the per-week incidences of Influenza and RSV are identical, the average value is minimal, i.e. zero, and when Influenza and RSV do not coincide on any week the average |DR| is 1. When calculating the per week relative disease ratio over multiple LTZs, the overall ratio is the weighted average of the ratios in the LTZs. ",
