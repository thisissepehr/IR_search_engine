With the addition of CD34+ stem cells to the allograft, the delayed engraftment observed with simple elutriated marrow was avoided. Our patients showed a median time to neutrophil (ANC4500) and platelet (420 000 without transfusion for 7 days) recovery of 16 days and 25 days, respectively. These results are similar to those reported by O'Donnell et al 15 in adult patients undergoing matched sibling transplants with similarly prepared allografts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GVHD"}, {"text": "The incidence of clinically significant GVHD (19%) observed in this study was low. In patients undergoing HLA-matched unrelated BMTs, the rates of clinically significant GVHD exceed 75% with unmanipulated grafts and CSA/methotrexate prophylaxis. 31 Although some degree of GVHD is desirable because of its associated graft vs leukemia effect, precise titration of GVHD is difficult. GVHD therefore remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in unrelated transplants. At this institution, the use of simple TCD decreased the incidence of clinically significant GVHD to below 25%. 9 However, simple TCD was associated with a higher incidence (10%) of graft failure and thus did not lead to an overall improvement in survival. 32 The concomitant use of CD34+ augmentation with elutriation has allowed us to achieve fast and durable engraftment while maintaining low rates of severe GVHD. In a simultaneous study of adults undergoing matched sibling transplants, O'Donnell et al reported a rate of clinically significant GVHD of only 11%. 15 These results are consistent with the rate of 19% observed here in pediatric patients undergoing related and unrelated transplant.

However, in patients with nonmalignant diseases, the subset of patients in whom prevention of GVHD is most desirable because it carries no associated graft vs leukemia benefit, this technique of graft manipulation was associated with a significant risk of graft failure. Possible explanations for this finding include more intact immunity compared to heavily pretreated leukemia patients and alloimmunization from multiple red blood cell transfusions. For children with nonmalignant diseases, it will be necessary to reduce the risk of graft rejection by increasing immune ablation by the preparative regimen and/or by improving posttransplant immune suppression.
