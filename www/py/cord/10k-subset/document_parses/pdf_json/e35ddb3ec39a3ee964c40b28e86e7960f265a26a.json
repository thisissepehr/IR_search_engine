However, doubts about the validity of these Y-linkage studies 2 led to an era dominated by the idea that the Y chromosome possessed little genetic content, and that its sole purpose was to trigger testis development in males. 10 Such was the redundancy assigned to the Y chromosome that some commentators described it as a 'genetic wasteland' during this period. 3 Subsequent work on the Y chromosome during the 1990s reinforced its role in the reproductive system with the localisation of the specific testis-determining factor to sex-determining region Y (SRY) 11 and the definition of three distinct loci involved in spermatogenesis (azoospermia factor a, b and c), deletions of which are associated with varying degrees of spermatogenic failure in men. 12 Recent advances in genetic technologies enabling mapping and sequencing of the Y chromosome have again altered scientific perspectives on the Y. Although the Human Genome Project confirmed that there is relatively sparse protein-coding material within the Y and a high degree of repetition, the finding that more than half of the active genes are expressed in non-gonadal tissue throughout the body 3 has brought the Y to the forefront of research on men's susceptibility to disease. The male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) makes up 95% of its length. 3 Unlike autosomal chromosomes, the MSY does not undergo reciprocal recombination with a partner chromosome during meiosis. 3 Only short regions at either tip of the chromosome undergo recombination with the X, and these are called the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs). 3 Because of the lack of crossing over, the MSY is transmitted unaltered from father to son along the paternal line. 3 Using a combination of genetic markers (usually single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) it is possible to classify each individual Y chromosome into one of numerous haplogroups. 13 In 2002, the Y Chromosome Consortium collated all phylogenetically informative SNPs discovered to date, constructing a robust maximum-parsimony tree, and assigning universal nomenclature to each recognised haplogroup; 14 subsequently, this was updated through sporadic SNP discovery, 15 and more recently thanks to large-scale resequencing projects that have yielded tens of thousands of SNPs. [16] [17] [18] To simplify the task of selecting suitable SNPs for genotyping in medical and other studies, a stable minimal phylogeny containing 417 SNPs has also been described. 19 The phylogenetic framework has been incorporated into studies of association between the Y chromosome and susceptibility to complex diseases. This important development has filled (at least to some extent) a void in genetic association discovery for the Y chromosome left by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in which, due to its haploid nature, the Y chromosome was routinely ignored. 20 Compared with all other nuclear chromosomes, the Y harbours the smallest number of genes at 568 and is considerably shorter than the X chromosome in length (~57 Mbp compared with~156 Mbp). 21 Based on Ensembl data (v86), only 71 of the Y-chromosome genes have protein-coding potential; however, several of the encoded proteins belong to the same protein families, leaving only 27 genes coding for distinct MSY proteins. 21 These 27 protein-coding genes are displayed in Figure 1 .

A linkage of Y to blood pressure has also been demonstrated in rat strains other than the Wistar Kyoto. 27 Search for a potential locus mediating this effect in rats has focused on the SRY gene, already well established as the testis-determining factor. Whereas humans possess a single copy of SRY on the Y, normotensive experimental rats carry multiple highly similar copies. 28 Sequencing techniques show the presence of an additional SRY3 copy in the SHR, 29,30 containing a proline-to-threonine amino acid substitution at position 76. 30 Importantly, SRY is a transcription factor that, in synergy with androgen receptor and in a testosteronedependent manner, 30 regulates promoter regions for genes encoding angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 29known for their key roles in blood pressure regulation. The threonine point mutation in SRY3 has been shown to reduce SRY3 promoter regulation, 30 leading to an increase in transcription of angiotensinogen, renin and ACE, thus promoting formation of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II); in contrast, SRY3 has an inhibitory effect on ACE2 transcription, the enzyme important for formation of vasodilatory and blood pressure-lowering Ang-(1-7). 29 Experimental delivery of SRY3 to normotensive rat kidneys raises blood pressure, 30,31 a rise that can be prevented by concomitant administration of olmesartan, a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor. 30 The in silico analysis and transfection studies of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells show that the SRY X paralogue (SOX3) is also capable of influencing RAAS gene expression, although in vivo SOX3 is primarily transcribed in non-kidney tissues. 32 This suggests that the SRY paralogue is unique in its pro-hypertensive effects in male rats.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 721, "end": 729, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "HYPERTENSION"}, {"text": "The translatability of SRY as a key blood pressure regulator to humans is uncertain.

Indeed, although protein sequence analysis would suggest the high degree of JmjC sequence similarity between UTY and the functional KDMs (Figure 3) , there is some conflict in the literature regarding whether UTY inherently possesses histone demethylase activity. UTX knockout experiments in mice embryos suggest that UTY exhibits redundancy for UTX activity. 59 Follow-up in vivo analysis, however, found that both mouse and human UTY lacked inherent histone demethylase activity, suggesting that biological functions of UTY (and UTX) may be at least partly independent of the demethylase region. 59 In contrast, a different group conducted in vitro analysis revealing conserved UTY histone demethylase activity, although reduced compared with UTX. 60 Based on studies conducted to date, UTY appears capable of regulating gene expression, possibly (at least in part) via histone demethylation. It is tempting to speculate that altered UTY expression in carriers of haplogroup I may contribute to the observed changes in their macrophage expression of inflammatory and immune pathways.

The uncertainty regarding precise identification of the causal haplogroup is exacerbated by two haplogroups accounting for nearly 90% of the cohort. Analyses of populations of different ethnicities (such as East Asians) with greater haplogroup diversity and an absence of haplogroup I 13 would enable greater understanding of the specific cause for the altered CAD risk.

One of the strongest pieces of evidence is the association between haplogroup I and increased CAD risk, in the context of inflammation and immunity. Future endeavours will need to concentrate on identifying specific MSY genes that directly influence inflammatory and adaptive immunity processes within atherosclerosis. The identification of 12 X-Y dosage-sensitive gene pairs has refined our focus for future studies. Three of these pairs warrant further attention given their prior associations with haplogroup I and/or immune processes: UTY/UTX, PRKY/PRKX and KDM5D/KDM5C, with UTY being the most promising functional candidate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Ipertricosi auricolare famigliare", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Tommasi", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1907, "venue": "Arch Psichaitr Neuropat Antropol Crim Med Leg", "volume": "28", "issn": "", "pages": "60--67", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "The problem of complete Y-linkage in man", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Stern", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1957, "venue": "Am J Hum Genet", "volume": "9", "issn": "", "pages": "147--166", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "The male-specific region of the human Y chromosome is a mosaic of discrete sequence classes", "authors": [{"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Skaletsky", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Kuroda-Kawaguchi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Minx", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "423", "issn": "", "pages": "825--837", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Enriques P: Hologynic heredity", "authors": [], "year": 1922, "venue": "Genetics", "volume": "7", "issn": "", "pages": "583--589", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Y-chromosome inheritance of hairy ears", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Gates", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1960, "venue": "Science", "volume": "132", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Final pedigrees of Y chromosome inheritance", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Gates", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Chakravartti", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Mukherjee", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1962, "venue": "Am J Hum Genet", "volume": "14", "issn": "", "pages": "363--375", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Molecular evidence for absence of Y-linkage of the Hairy Ears trait", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Kamalam", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Adams", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Jobling", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Eur J Hum Genet", "volume": "12", "issn": "", "pages": "1077--1079", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Human aggression and the extra Y chromosome.
