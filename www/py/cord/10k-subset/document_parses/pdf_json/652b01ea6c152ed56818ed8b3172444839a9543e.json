Subsequently, the unemployment rate jumped nearly 6 percentage points over the next year and the US economy re-entered a major recession. In the midst of the current global recovery from the Great Recession, European and American policymakers again seem intent on pursuing the path of budget austerity. In light of slowing economic growth rates, shrinking consumer and business confi dence, and stubbornly high unemployment fi gures, could it be that Western economies are ignoring lessons from the past?",

While the financial crisis certainly hastened the pace of the downturn, the recession began almost a year before the fi nancial crisis. It was caused by the downturn in house prices that had already led to a collapse in residential construction and was starting to weaken consumption. House prices nationwide were falling at an average rate of more than two per cent a month (more than three per cent a month in some cities) before the fi nancial crisis hit in the autumn of 2008. The defl ation of the housing bubble would have led to a severe slump whether or not it was accompanied by a fi nancial crisis. This is shown by the example of Spain, where a better regulated banking system largely shielded the country from the worst effects of the fi nancial crisis. Nonetheless, Spain's economy is among the hardest hit The rise in the trade defi cit was a result of the run-up in the dollar following the East Asian fi nancial crisis. In the wake of that crisis, countries throughout the developing world began to accumulate massive amounts of reserves to ensure that they would not be subjected to the same pressures by the IMF as the countries of East Asia were. This meant maintaining low-valued currencies and running large trade defi cits. In the next decade, the developing world became a massive exporter of capital to the United States, which implied the large defi cit seen in the GDP data.",

Consumption was also extraordinarily high as a share of GDP, 5.4 percentage points above its average in the earlier period. This is the predictable result of the housing wealth effect. At its peak, the bubble added more than $8 trillion to homeowners' wealth compared to a scenario in which prices had just kept pace with their long-term trend.

There is considerable uncertainty for both, but the most reasonable assumption is probably that net exports will be a small positive. The dollar is down sharply from its crisis peaks and the economies of the United States' trading partners in the developing world are growing far more rapidly than the US economy. Therefore it is more likely that the change in net exports in the next couple of years will be adding to, rather than subtracting from, growth.",

The government could therefore play a proactive role in creating incentives to attract more private sector fi nancing. The Obama administration, for example, has backed the creation of a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank, which could issue infrastructure bonds, provide subsidies to qualifi ed infrastructure projects and provide loan guarantees to state or local governments. In 2008, President Obama suggested that the Bank would borrow US$60 billion of federal funding to invest in infrastructure, while leveraging \"up to US$500 billion\" of private investment. Europe is considering the implementation of a new European 2020 Project Bond Initiative, which would use public guarantees to leverage private sector fi nancing from nontraditional investors, such as pension funds to invest \u20ac1.5 trillion to \u20ac2 trillion (approximately US$2 trillion to US$2.7 trillion) in Europe's infrastructure over the period 2011-2020. 17",

While risks had already been high, the threat of a lost decade has escalated as a result of the recent market turmoil. But since debt levels are high, the scope for fi scal stimulus is constrained. Governments should therefore invest in bottleneck releasing projects that create jobs in the short term and raise growth in the medium term. If projects are well chosen and increase future growth and government revenue, the government's debt burden will not increase. Especially if projects generate user fees, they might be self-fi nancing. But if excess capacity continues to persist, fi rms could start scrapping equipment. And if unemployment spells continue to increase, the unemployed will fi nd it even more diffi cult to return to work. This would further depress growth. A lack of growth is perhaps the largest threat as regards higher future debt burdens.",

For developing countries, infrastructure investments can be a powerful vehicle for transforming their economies, enabling their businesses to work unimpeded without electricity shortages, to communicate freely, expand their markets and, ultimately, climb up the technological ladder. But its benefi ts do not stop there. Scaling up infrastructure investment in developing countries would generate much needed manufacturing jobs in advanced countries, raise their exports, reduce excess capacity and support jobs and growth. A global infrastructure initiative, where advanced and reserve-rich economies invest in bottleneck-releasing infrastructure projects which close the infrastructure fi nancing gap of the developing world, could create a virtuous cycle in which more global savings fl ow to support investment and growth in developing countries, which in turn would generate more import demand from advanced economies, thereby reinforcing global growth and putting the recovery on more solid ground. The \"new normal\", a return to pre-crisis growth levels in advanced economies and strong growth in developing countries, could become a new reality.",

Government guarantees can insure against project-related risks, such as a shortfall in demand. But they are unlikely to mitigate investors' perception of governmental risk, such as policy reversal, regulatory failure and concerns with regard to the creditworthiness of the government. Multilateral institutions and donors are likely to be better positioned to assume these risks. The World Bank has increasingly made use of guarantees to catalyse private fi nance by mitigating the risk of default by governments. As of March 2010, it had approved 36 guarantees, with a cumulative Bank guarantee amount of $3.8 billion in 28 countries. 22 The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), the arm of the World Bank that provides political risk insurance for foreign investments, recently adapted its products and expanded the potential applications of its guarantees in order to facilitate the underwriting of infrastructure projects.",

The main drivers behind these price hikes are commodities and especially food prices, which were fl at for decades. Grain prices dropped by 75% between 1950 and the end of the 1980s 4 and then remained low into the fi rst years of the new century. Since 2008 the Food Price Index of the FAO shows two strong price hikes. After a gradual increase between 2002 and 2007 the index rose sharply in 2008. The fi nancial crisis halted this rise, but in 2010 prices reached the next all-time high. High food prices squeeze the emerging economies. Consumer prices in China for example were up 6.1% in September from a year earlier, with food prices up by a tremendous 13.4%. Even if prices fall when economic growth slows, there are structural problems behind the food price hikes. Food exerts a latent pressure on prices.",
