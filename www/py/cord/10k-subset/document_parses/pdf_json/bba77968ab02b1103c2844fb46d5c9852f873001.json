Though ECDC is set to have a staff of around 300 and an annual budget of over \u20ac50 million by the end of the decade, this is small in comparison with the CDC in Atlanta which numbers its staff in thousands and its budget in billions. Indeed, ECDC is small in comparison with the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin or the UK and French public health agencies. This is because public health remains primarily a Member State competence in the EU. ECDC supports the work of Europe's national disease control agencies, but does not centralise power or resources. The Centre does not have executive or regulatory powers, and key assets such as laboratories continue to be located in national institutes. The core functions of this Centre can be summarised as follows: reinforce and develop EU level disease surveillance, reinforce the EU's rapid alert systems against disease outbreaks, support the EU and its Member States in strengthening preparedness and response against epidemics, provide authoritative scientific advice on infectious diseases and the risks they pose, and work closely with Member States and other partners to prevent and control such diseases.",

While the idea of creating a European CDC had been around for quite some time amongst public health experts, the outbreak of SARS in 2003 and its rapid spread across countries confirmed the urgency of the creation of an institution dedicated to EU-level cooperation on public health issues. The ECDC was set up in record time for an EU agency: the European Commission presented draft legislation in July 2003 [1], by the spring of 2004 ECDC's Founding Regulation had been passed [2] and by the spring of 2005 the Centre opened its doors. As it started its activities, another threat -H5N1 avian influenza arriving in the EU's neighbourhood and the fear that it could adapt or mutate into a pandemic strain of human influenza -confirmed the relevance of its mission.",
