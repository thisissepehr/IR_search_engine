The role of TNF in this model was investigated using etanercept; a recombinant human soluble TNF receptor fusion protein reported to have efficacy in patients with persistent asthma and known to neutralise mouse TNF.

On day 14, mice were exposed to saline or Der p (100 lg or 25 lg) via intranasal instillation. 48 hours post-challenge, non-invasive whole body plethysmography was used to assess AHR stimulated by doubling concentrations of aerosolised methacholine (MCh, 3.125-50 mg/ml).

The present study tested the effects of culture on the intrinsic tone of rat pulmonary arteries (PAs) and examined the function and expression of K + channels involved in regulating the resting membrane potential (E m ) and tone of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were sacrificed according to Schedule I of the UK Scientific Procedures (Animals) Act 1986. Intrapulmonary arteries were isolated and cultured as previously described (Gurney et al., 2005) . Contractile responses of fresh and cultured PA to various drugs were measured using vessel myography. The E m of PASMC was recorded using the perforated patch technique and K + channel expression quantified using real time RT-PCR. The contractile response to 1 lM phenylephrine did not change during culture, but subsequent relaxation to 1lM carbachol was significantly reduced. Over 4 days in culture, contractile responses to 15 mM KCl, 1 mM 4-aminopyridine and 10 mM tetraethylammonium increased, while the vessels developed an uncharacteristic relaxation response to 1 lM nifedipine, 10 lM levcromakalim and Ca 2+ -free solution. These changes were associated with depolarisation of the PASMC E m and down regulation of Kv1.5, Kv2.1 and TASK-1 mRNA expression. Bubbling the culture medium with 95% O 2 partially reversed the changes observed. The changes in PA function that developed during culture are consistent with a progressive depolarisation of PASMC, probably resulting from reduced expression of background K + channels, especially TASK-1.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) develops in approximately 4% of the patients (or~20 000 cases) with acute pulmonary embolism each year because of unresolved thromboemboli. CTEPH is a relatively common, progressive and potentially fatal disease process. One currently proposed theory for such poor resolution advocates that modification of fibrin in CTEPH patients causes resistance of emboli to fibrinolysis, which could lead to pulmonary vascular remodeling. Control of intracellular calcium is central to the regulation of cell migration, proliferation and contraction and contributes to the pathophysiological process of vascular remodeling. The current study investigates the regulation of intracellular calcium by chronic exposure of pulmonary artery smooth muscle (PASMC) and endothelial (PAEC) cells to thrombin and fibrin. PASMC or PAEC were plated on control, fibrinogen (FNG), thrombin or fibrin coated cover slips for 72 h. Cells were loaded with a fluorescent calcium sensitive dye, Fura-2-AM, and changes in intracellular calcium in response to thrombin (5 nM) were recorded. Chronic exposure of PAEC to thrombin, an agonist of proteinase-activated receptors, significantly reduced the agonist-induced peak calcium transient (F/F 0 ratio) from 1.3 \u00b1 0.07 (n = 27) to 0.97 \u00b1 0.06 (n = 43), P < 0.001. However, in PASMC a substantial increase was observed. The peak calcium was significantly increased in PASMC chronically exposed to 4 lg/ml fibrin and the recovery rate of the agonist-induced calcium transients decelerated (P < 0.05). In PAEC, only higher FNG and fibrin concentrations (40 lg/ml) significantly affected the calcium transients; decreasing the peak calcium transient and the calcium transient peak width at 50% of the peak height (P < 0.05) when compared to control in PAEC. In conclusion, chronic exposure of cells to fibrinogen, fibrin and thrombin caused changes in intracellular calcium which could stimulate accelerated smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration and contraction. Prolonged exposure to thrombin had a potent effect reducing agonist-induced calcium transient in PAEC, suggesting a desensitization of receptors and intracellular calcium regulation in these cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "C029"}, {"text": "Activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR 8 lead to endothelin-1 release from pulmonary vascular smooth muscle: relevance to pulmonary hypertension R Badiger, A Liu, J Mitchell, P De Sousa, S Wort, M Paul-Clark Imperial College, London, UK Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is an important mediator in pulmonary hypertension. Usually released by the endothelium; it can be released by pulmonary vascular cells, and act in an autocrine manner (Wort et al., 2001) to cause vasoconstriction and smooth muscle hypertrophy. Pathogens, via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), can mediate profound vascular responses, e.g. the shock induced by lipopolysaccaride. These responses are mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), (Mitchell et al., 2007) . Our aim was to determine if bacterial and viral PAMPS can lead to endothelin-1 release from pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, and thus whether pathogens can be triggers to pulmonary hypertension. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle (HPASM) cells were grown in 96 well plates and were stimulated with a range of PAMPS. Supernatants were collected at 24 h. In addition, primary human endothelial (HE) cells were also stimulated with PAMPs. ET-1 was measured by ELISA. Our results showed that synthetic ligands for viral PAMPS, Poly I:C, (activates TLR 3), and LyoVec (ligand for TLR 8), cause ET-1 release from HPASM cells. Importantly, bacterial PAMPs did not cause ET-1 release in these cells. By contrast, activation of TLR8 or TLR3 did not elevate ET-1 in HE cells. These observations are the first to indicate a role for viral pathogen sensing in pulmonary hypertension.

This dimerization concept raises the problem of how two different receptors can influence the coupling of each other and determine the ultimate function of the complex. We previously reported an interaction between the ET A and ET B receptors (ET-R) in rat pulmonary arteries, which may modify endothelin-1-(ET-1) induced vasoconstriction (Sauvageau et al. 2007 ). To test this hypothesis we developed a novel non-pharmacological vessel culture technique combined with gene therapy. Small isolated pulmonary arteries (100-150 lM) from male wistar rats (200-250 g) were harvested and pooled for standard protein extraction. Heterodimerization of receptors was evaluated by immunoprecipitation of the ET B -R, followed by Western blotting for the expression of the ET A receptor in both denaturating and non-denaturating conditions. For gene therapy experiments, pulmonary arteries were incubated and exposed for 24 (ET A -R) or 72 h (ET B -R) to selective antisense (AS) oligonucleotides. A total of two different AS oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ON) phosphorothioate (PTO) sequences were used targeting either the rat ET A receptor (ET A -AS) or the rat ET B receptor (ET B -AS) mRNA sequences. The corresponding 2 scrambled (Sc) ON sequences were used as negative controls (Sc-ET A -AS; Sc-ET B -AS). Following the incubation period pulmonary arteries were mounted on a microvessel myograph to assess ET-1-induced constriction. Heterodimerization of both receptors was observed. Western blotting confirmed that each AS reduced protein expression of its targeted receptor. The use of ET B -AS significantly reduced the sensitivity to ET-1 ()7.90 \u00b1 0.09; logEC 25 \u00b1 SEM, P < 0.05) compared to control vessel ()8.59 \u00b1 0.17) without affecting the maximal vasoconstriction. In contrast, ET A -AS significantly increased the vascular sensitivity ()8.36 \u00b1 0.04, P < 0.05) and the maximal vasoconstriction induced by ET-1 (100 \u00b1 3, Emax \u00b1 SEM, P < 0.05) compared to controls ()7.83 \u00b1 0.05, 89 \u00b1 3%). In conclusion, suppression of ET B receptors reduced vascular sensitivity to ET-1 while suppression of ET A receptors increased the vascular sensitivity to this peptide. Hence, there is an interaction between the ET A and ET B receptors to induce the ET-1 response in rat pulmonary arteries. Furthermore, these results confirm the functional importance of ET B receptors in ET-1-induced vasoconstriction of small pulmonary arteries.

Cimaterol binding (a non-catechol agonist) however was minimally affected. The S228A and S229A mutations reduced both the affinity of CGP 12177 for the catecholamine site (25.5 and 7.1-fold) and also its agonist potency (15.5 and 6.8-fold) at the 'CGP 12177 site'.

This construct allowed us to locally (and instantaneously) label the receptors in a small region of the membranes in living cells. We used a confocal microscope (Leica) equipped with appropriate lasers, thermostatic baths and software for data collection. Solutions of two-dimensional diffusion equation (analytical or numerical) for appropriate boundary and initial conditions were used for quantitative evaluation of the data. We found that 1) functional integrity of the dendra-tagged receptor remains intact (as assessed by agonist stimulated cyclase activation or radioligand binding experiments), 2) inward or outward flux of the receptor to, or from a small membrane patch (~4 micron-sq) can be symmetrically explained by the same simple diffusion process with a diffusion coefficient of~0.1 micron-sq/s (with an average mobile fraction of 85%), 3) this process is found to be independent of the activity state of the receptor, as assessed by using constitutively active mutants of the receptor, 4) only a part of the large scale movement of the receptor in the membrane can be explained by the same local diffusion process, implying the presence of large-scales diffusion barriers in the membrane, 5) cell-wide re-distribution of the receptor protein in the membrane is governed by the same local diffusion process (i.e. the entire cell membrane is apparently available to the receptor molecules, and 6) all the visible compartments (within the spatial resolution of the microscope) in the cell are interconnected within the time frame of hours.

Recent research from our laboratory (Mundell et al., 2006) and others (Puthenveedu and von Zastrow 2006) has suggested that there may be multiple populations of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) available to selectively sort GPCR cargo. In this present study we examined the structural determinants present in the COOH tail of the P2Y 12 receptor that regulate their internalization into CCPs. These studies were undertaken either in CHO cells stably transfected with receptor constructs or in HEK293 cells. N-terminal tagged (either HA or FLAG) receptor constructs were co-transfected into cells using Lipofectamine. Surface receptor surface loss was measured by ELISA and cellular distribution of HA-tagged or FLAG-tagged receptor examined by immunofluorescence microscopy as previously described (Mundell et al., 2006) . Our initial studies confirmed that deletion of the last four amino acids (E 339 stop), a PDZ motif (ETPM), of the P2Y 12 receptor attenuated receptor internalization. Interestingly mutation of P341 to alanine in this motif also attenuated receptor internalization. Subsequent immunofluorescent studies revealed that both P341A and E 339 stop trafficked to clathrin-coated pits but did not colocalize with full length P2Y 12 receptor at these sites. In addition colocalization with arrestin, which regulates P2Y 12 receptor entry into CCPs was not evident for E 339 stop. Subsequent experiments revealed that following internalization both E 339 stop and P341A did not traffic normally back to the cell surface but were retained in an as yet uncharacterised endosomal compartment. This intracellular retention attenuated receptor resensitization.

For hydroxyl groups and others which have only small apparent molal volumes it is likely to involve interactions with water.

From the geometry of the drugs it is possible to construct crude models showing areas (or pockets) in the receptor with which the drugs may interact but these need to be checked against models derived from aminoacid sequences. The validity of these models likewise needs to be checked by comparing values of log.K which they may provide against the experimental ones. Comparisons can be made between receptor types: the effect of replacing hydrogen by an aromatic ring in antagonists acting at nicotinic receptors in the frog rectus abdominis is smaller than for muscarinic receptors in ileum. This paper shows what you can do with a library of values of log.K (pA 2 ). It would be particularly interesting to compare group effects for muscarinic receptors with those for histamine H1 receptors in ileum.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "C038"}, {"text": "Effects of rosiglitazone and sumatriptan in human isolated small and large coronary arteries K Bagot, B Sheldrick Asterand UK Ltd, Royston, UK Recently, the FDA expressed concerns over a potential increased risk for heart attacks in relation to rosiglitazone (www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/ NEW01636.html) (PPARc agonist used in diabetes management).

L-carnitine (LC) is an endogenous mitochondrial membrane compound and some studies have reported that LC could effectively protect various functions of mitochondria and cells against oxidative injury both in vitro and in vivo. However, the exact molecular mechanism of LC on oxidative stress in neurodegeneration is unclear. In the present study we used the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line as an in vitro model and assessed the effect of L-carnitine on hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-mediated oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Cells in culture were treated for 24 h with 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 lM H 2 O 2 alone or pretreated with 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 300 and 1000 lM L-carnitine. H 2 O 2 produced a dose-related decrease in cell viability as measured by Trypan blue exclusion assays, a reduction in the mitochondrial metabolism of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and an increase in DNA fragmentation analysis. Pretreatment with LC 2 h inhibited H 2 O 2 -induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. And analysis of DNA fragmentation showed that LC could prevent H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that LC could inhibit the release of of cytochrome c from mitochondria and upregulated the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP27, HSP 70 and HSP 90) levels compared with untreated control cells. Meanwhile, the expression of two endogenous anti-oxidant defense components, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible (GADD) mRNA, GADD45 and GADD153, were observed at the early phase during cell death in 400 lM H 2 O 2 -treated control groups and LC could elevate the expression of GADD genes to protected DNA from oxidative damage. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LC exerts protective effects against oxidative stress in part by protect mitochondria and up-regulating the levels of endogenous anti-oxidant defense components and stress proteins, GADD genes and HSPs. This evidences support the pharmacological potential of LC in the management of oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases. Previous work has demonstrated that the treatment of diabetes with PPARc agonists is associated with a reduced risk of some cardiovascular complications. We have, therefore, examined the effects of PPARc agonists on platelet function. Washed platelets were stimulated with PPARc ligands and collagen-induced aggregation was measured using optical aggregometry. Calcium levels were measured by spectrofluorimetry in Fura-2AM loaded platelets. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of early signalling components of the GPVI signalling pathway were measured using imunoblot analysis. The role of PPARc agonists in thrombus formation was assessed using an in vitro flow system, where fluorescently labelled whole blood was perfused through a collagen coated capillary at a shear rate of 1000/s in the presence or absence of PPARc agonists. Thrombus volume was quantified by confocal microscope using Leica Sp2 software. In this study, we report that PPARc ligand rosiglitazone inhibits collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation. This was accompanied by a reduction in collagen-stimulated intracellular calcium mobilization and reduction of thrombus formation on immobilised collagen under arterial flow conditions in a concentration-dependent manner. This was accompanied by inhibition of collagen-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cc2. We propose that the PPARc ligands may have beneficial clinical actions through inhibition of platelet activation. Furthermore our results demonstrate a novel non-genomic mode for nuclear receptor action, and functional cross-talk between the collagen receptor GPVI and nuclear receptor signalling families in platelets.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "C039"}, {"text": "Identification of the anti-apoptosis activity of nerve growth factor on cardiac myocytes A Caporali, G Sala-Newby, C Emanueli Bristol Heart Institute, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK Neurotrophins (NTs) control the survival and regeneration of neurons. Recent research showed that NTs posses cardiovascular actions. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the NT nerve growth factor (NGF) prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We demonstrated that cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (RNCMs) produce NGF and express its trkA receptor. RNCMs given a neutralizing antibody for NGF or the trkA inhibitor K252a underwent apoptosis, thus suggesting that NGF is an endogenous pro-survival factor for cardiomyocytes. Recombinant NGF induced trkA phosphorylation, followed by Ser473-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Akt in RNCMs. In response to Akt activation, Forkhead transcription factors Foxo-3a and Foxo-1 were phosphorylated and excluded from the nucleus. Adenovirus (Ad)-mediated NGF over-expression RNCMs protected RNCMs apoptosis induced by either hypoxia/reoxygenation or angiotensin II. Inhibitory approaches using K252a, LY294002 (a pan-phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase -PI3K-inhibitor), and adenoviruses carrying a dominant negative mutant form of Akt (Ad.DN.Akt) or an Akt-resistant Foxo-3a (Ad.AAA-Foxo-3a) demonstrated that the pathway encompassing trkA, PI3K-Akt, and Foxo is essential for the pro-survival effect of NGF. The anti-apoptosis action of NGF was confirmed in adult myocytes extracted from the mouse heart, which were submitted to the angiotensin II apoptosis test in the presence of recombinant NGF.

During the last few years, an effort has been made in medical, to use contemporary communicative methods of teaching, like problem based teaching. Nevertheless, it is obvious that lack of theoretical knowledge on the procedure of learning and on methodology of teaching restricts the application of communicative methods of teaching. The aim of this work is to present the theories of constructivism in learning, and to develop a new structuralistic model of the construction of knowledge in integrated methods of teaching, which may serve as the theoretical basis for problem based learning (PBL) and problem based teaching (PBT). The psychological constructivism of Piaget, the social constructivism of Durkheim and the radical constructivism of von Glaserfeld have given the basis for the development of communicative methods of teaching. Neo-Piazetian theories have developed models of learning process and have suggested new strategies for solving problems in teaching and learning. Understanding memory and its organization can make teaching and learning easier. Factors influencing memory and learning are: motivated attention, grade of familiarity with new information, the way of classifying and relating new information with old data, chunking of perceived information, repetition, and knowledge of rules of memory processing and data storing. Problem based teaching is a communicative, student oriented method of teaching, which offers strong motivation for learning and memorizing. In this work, as well as presenting the theoretical background, models of the construction of knowledge are presented briefly, as well as the new structuralistic model of the construction of knowledge in PBL, which has been developed by the author. All the data are presented in a simple, interactive and friendly to the audience manner, with a lot of images and in a way that provides strong motivation for participation of the audience.

Contrarily, alpha adrenoceptor-induced contractions of mesenteric arteries from LPS-treated mice were reported to be enhanced via the activation of Rho-kinase pathway which involves also the endothelin peptides (Buyukafsar et al., 2004) .Thus, we investigated the effect of LPS on the contractile responsiveness of rat prostatic vas deferens with special emphasis on the role of endothelin peptides. Wistar albino rats (250-350 g) pretreated with LPS (4 mg/kg, ip) was then given bosentan (30 mg/kg, ip twice at 2nd and 12th hour after LPS). Parallel controls received saline (0.9% NaCl, ip).

This study was undertaken to evaluate the relevance of H 2 S in carrageenan (CGN)-induced experimental acute arthritis. Male Wistar rats (180-220 g) were subjected, under halothane anaesthesia, to intra articular injection (i.art. injection) of 3% CGN or saline (50 ll; control group). Sixty min before CGN injection, either an inhibitor of H 2 S formation, DL-propargylglycine (PAG; 53 mmol/knee joint), or an H 2 S donor, Lawson's reagent (3.6 lmol/knee joint), was injected i.art. in the ipsilateral (IPSI) knee joint. Following 4 h CGN injection, functional assays revealed that the IPSI knee of vehicle-treated rats exhibited a potent oedema associated with pain scored behaviour and high contents of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity in the synovial fluid. Treatment with Lawson's reagent significantly attenuated the CGN-induced oedema (3.32 \u00b1 0.1 and 2.47 \u00b1 0.2 mm** for control and treated, respectively; n = 7-8), pain score (1.7 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.87 \u00b1 0.2* for control and treated) and MPO activity (281 \u00b1 41.6 and 74 \u00b1 9.6** U/cavity for control and treated), but failed to reduce increased iNOS activity (0.44 \u00b1 0.2 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 pmol/min/mg protein for control and treated). In contrast, the treatment of rats with PAG had no effect on CGN-induced arthritic signs and further potentiated synovial iNOS activity (4.45 \u00b1 0.24*** pmol/min/mg protein; n = 4). We show for the first time that exogenous supply of H 2 S in the knee joint allowed a significant reduction of CGN-induced acute arthritis signs and symptoms, although did not prevent the up-regulation of iNOS, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of arthritis.

Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were used in this study. Acute reaction to local subcutaneous histamine administration (100 ll, 5 mM) was followed by measuring paw oedema formation, with the use of a plethysmometer. H1R and TNF-a gene expression at various time-points following histamine administration was determined semi-quantitatively by conventional, end-point, RT-PCR on RNA isolated from subcutaneous tissue excised from rat paws. Histamine induced a significant increase in steady state mRNA levels of both H1R and TNF-a in the rat paw. The time course of this up-regulation was specific for the two transcripts. H1R expression was relatively low during the first 3 h, peaked at hours four to five, and then fell again at hour six, post-histamine. TNF-a gene expression responded in biphasic manner, with a steady increase during the first 3 h, followed by a reduction at hour four and a new increase, but at a lower rate, over hours five and six following the injection of histamine into the paw.

Pathogens, via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), can mediate profound vascular responses, for example, the shock induced by lipopolysaccaride. These responses are mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs)(Mitchell et al., 2007).
