In Europe, 29.9% of the isolates are oxacillin-resistant. The changing epidemiology of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial infections and the decreasing susceptibility to first-line antibiotics leave clinicians with few therapeutic options. The objective of our study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, the associated molecular mechanisms of resistance and the epidemiological relatedness of MRSA strains isolated from the endotracheal tubes (ETT) of intubated critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Methods: The antimicrobial susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid, gentamicin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, rifampicin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and tetracycline were measured. Resistance mechanisms were then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing. Results: S. aureus isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and fusidic acid. The most frequent mutations in quinolone-resistant S. aureus strains were S84L in the gyrA gene, V511A in the gyrB gene, S144P in the grlA gene, and K401R/E in the grlB gene. Strains resistant to erythromycin carried the ermC, ermA, and msrA genes; the same ermC and ermA genes were detected in strains resistant to clindamycin. The aac(6\u2032)-aph(2\u2033) gene was related to gentamicin resistance, while resistance to tetracycline was related to tetK (efflux pump). The fusB gene was detected in the strain resistant to fusidic acid. The most frequent sequence types were ST22, ST8, and ST217, which were distributed in four clonal complexes (CC5, CC22, CC45, and CC59).",

Among all such cases of nosocomial pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus is the second most prevalent pathogen (17.8%), with 29.9% of the isolates in Europe being oxacillin-resistant [2] . The changing epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial infections, the decreasing susceptibility to first-line antibiotics, such as vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), linezolid resistant MRSA [3] , and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) leave clinicians with few therapeutic options. In this context, an accurate description of the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in MRSA nosocomial pneumonia in ICU could help in the design of novel therapies. Knowledge of resistance-related phenotypic and genotypic changes is critical for the development of new drugs. When designing a new antibiotic, the previously described resistance mechanisms must be taken into account. The new antimicrobial should be able to overcome the resistance mechanisms, or should be aimed at new targets where the probability that the microorganism has developed resistance is lower [4] .",

At the participating ICUs, S. aureus was not found to be resistant to first-line antibiotics such as linezolid and vancomycin. Although the prevalence of MRSA in the participating centres was low, the mechanisms of resistance described may also be representative for sites with high MRSA prevalence because the MRSA collected during this study corresponded to highly disseminated clonal complexes (CC22 and CC5). In addition, these strains harbored a wide range of antimicrobial mechanisms to second-line antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and fusidic acid.",

            "text": "Although our strains did not show resistance to linezolid, the detection of subpopulations resistant to this antimicrobial is a finding that merits comment. Hetero-resistance (HR) is an unstable phenomenon with a high incidence in several bacterial strains, according to recent reports. It is considered unstable because subpopulations defined as hetero-resistant in one susceptibility test may no longer appear as such if the test is repeated. The recent finding of plasmid-associated HR mechanisms emphasizes the problem, since these HR mechanisms may spread horizontally between pathogens. The lack of routine determination by many laboratories and the decrease in antimicrobial activity Another important feature is that the decrease in antimicrobial activity caused by this phenomenon is not reflected in the MIC value. Previous research also suggests that HR can indeed be responsible for treatment failure in S. aureus infections. However, this phenomenon is not detected by established procedures and new methods are needed for rapid identification of HR in pathogenic bacteria [13] . Few reports on MRSA resistance mechanisms contain an exhaustive evaluation of antibiotics. In our study we often identified a combination of several resistance mechanisms for MRSA strains, such as spontaneous mutations that decrease bacterial replication, transferable and chromosomal efflux pumps, and antimicrobial or target-modifying enzymes. In terms of antimicrobial susceptibility, similar results have been reported in other studies. For instance, in a series of MRSA strains isolated from different samples, Kitti et al. [14] found high levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin (72.1%), erythromycin (86.9%), gentamicin (72.1%), and clindamycin (86.9%).",

Several reports have indicated that topoisomerase IV is the primary target for quinolone resistance in Grampositive microorganisms, including S. aureus with DNAgyrase acting as secondary target, with specific point mutations at GrlA (subunit A of the topoisomerase IV) and GyrA (subunit A of the DNA-gyrase) as the most relevant [16] . However, our results differ because the mutation S144P in grlA gene may be a polymorphism, given that it is found in both susceptible and resistant strains. This means that the primary target in our strains is the DNAgyrase. Studies in Japan have not shown mutations in the gyrB and grlB genes [17] , which in any case tend to be infrequent in MRSA strains. Nevertheless, some of our strains showed more than three mutation points in each gene. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm whether these mutations determine resistance or genetic polymorphisms. In addition, in gyrA and grlA, some rare mutations were described (Table 2) . Because antibiotic combinations are used during nosocomial pneumonia treatment, these strains are exposed to strong antibiotic selection pressure which may contribute to the high number of mutations found here compared with prior studies. For instance, it has been demonstrated that hospitalacquired MRSA harbors higher levels of antimicrobial resistance than community-acquired MRSA [18] .",

However, the authors of the Algerian study included S. aureus from food, nosocomial, and community-acquired infections and identified only the ermC gene [6, 19] ; the fact that we only isolated strains from nosocomial pneumonia, whereas the other studies used different sources, could explain the differences observed.

Some S. aureus strains have shown inducible resistance to clindamycin after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin [22] . In our study, the D-test [10] revealed two MRSA isolates with inducible resistance to clindamycin.

Thus, mutations in two more genes (fusC and fusD) can lead to staphylococcal resistance to fusidic acid [24] . Several studies have also reported an increase in resistance to fusidic acid. We suggest a chromosomal location of the fusB gene because the primers we used were developed in previous studies by O'Neil et al. in which the fusB gene was detected in total DNA preparations but not in plasmid DNA preparations, indicating a chromosomal location for this resistance determinant (different fusB genes have been discovered on plasmid pUB101 and plasmid pUB102). Some previous data suggest that chromosomal fusB was associated with epidemic strains of S. aureus [25] . Interestingly, in another study fusB-type resistance (fusB and fusC) was found in 87% of MRSA isolates [24] , with an association between fusB and clonal complexes CC45 and CC97. By contrast, we found only one strain with fusB, and this was the singleton ST1535. Fusidic acid is a topical drug that is used for the treatment of staphylococcal skin infections, but its increased use appears to have led to the emergence and dissemination of resistant staphylococci [26] .",

            "text": "The molecular epidemiology of MRSA in bloodstream infections has been described previously, but less frequently in respiratory infections contracted in the ICU [27, 28] . CC22 is one of the largest circulating clonal complexes associated with hospital-acquired MRSA in Europe (UK) and Asia (Kuala Lumpur, China) [11, 29] , while studies of nosocomial pneumonia indicate that CC5 is associated with MRSA strains originating mostly from the US, Europe (Portugal), Asia (China), Africa (Algeria) and Latin America (Argentina and Chile) [18, 19, 30, 31] . Despite the marked heterogeneity of the sequence types in this study, CC22 and CC5 were the main clonal complexes detected. Specific resistance mechanisms can be associated with clonality, since a higher number of these mechanisms were found in the widely expanded CC5 and CC22 clones than in the CC45 and CC59 clones [32] . Consistent with our results, previous studies (in the US, Portugal and Japan) have found CC5 and CC59 to be associated with extensive multi-drug resistance, but not CC45 [32] . Another important point to stress is that these CCs had previously been associated with virulent S. aureus strains.",

Second, although we did not assess the virulence of our MRSA strains, some of the clonal complexes identified, such as the CC59 and CC45, have been shown to be closely related to virulent strains.

We also observed the presence of linezolid hetero-resistance and high resistance to second-line antibiotics in MRSA strains isolated from endotracheal tubes in humans mechanically ventilated for long periods in the ICU. These findings show that MRSA infection is still relevant in southern Europe, with a high capacity of resistance to different antimicrobials, an extensive battery of resistance mechanisms, and a wide clonal variability.",
