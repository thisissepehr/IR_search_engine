Chest computed tomography (CT) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis is not only expensive but also exposes patients to radiation and might cause patients to be at risk of infection during transportation; in addition, chest radiography cannot be used to monitor the lung repeatedly in real time. Therefore, the routine use of bedside lung ultrasonography for critically ill patients with ARDS is especially valuable. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of ultrasound for lung examination in patients with ARDS. Methods: Eleven patients infected with H7N9 avian influenza who developed ARDS were diagnosed by lung ultrasonography. Results: Six patients who had severe ARDS showed a diffuse comet tail sign or a consolidation score \u2265 7 and a lung ultrasound score \u2265 20 points. A diffuse comet tail sign or a consolidation score \u2264 6 and a lung ultrasound score < 25 were observed in four patients. One patient showed a diffuse comet tail sign or consolidation area in four lung areas, with an ultrasound score of 14. Among all 11 patients studied, 6 patients had thoracic puncture and drainage of pleural effusion and 2 patients had pneumothorax puncture drainage. Conclusions: Lung ultrasound could be useful for monitoring ARDS caused by the influenza virus A H7N9 strain in clinical applications.",

            "text": "H7N9 is a novel avian influenza virus A strain whose infection of poultry occurs worldwide, but infection of this subtype in humans in Asia has not been observed previously [1] . Surprisingly, this strain was found to be highly pathogenic to humans and infected three urban residents in Shanghai or Anhui, China, in March 2013. The virus spread mainly though the respiratory pathway via direct or intimate contact with excretions or secretions from infected birds [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Since then, the new H7N9 strain infections in humans have spread rapidly from eastern China to other provinces of China, leading to approximately 130 cases of infections that are highly pathogenic, rapidly progress to the lower respiratory tract, and have a high mortality rate [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Infection by the H7N9 strain causes highly distributed lesions in the infected lung. Due to immune deficiency during the early-to-mid course of the disease, the alveoli of the infected lung excrete exudate accompanied by lung consolidation and/or pleural effusion [7] . Finally, most of the patients develop and some die of severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [8, 9] . Thus, it is extraordinarily important to evaluate accurately the pathological lung entities and pulmonary aeration in these patients.",

We found that bedside ultrasonography could be used to evaluate H7N9 avian influenza infection in patients with ARDS and could be useful in other clinical applications. Correlations between the lung ultrasound score, the oxygenation index, and the bedside ultrasound value in the influenza A (H7N9) ARDS patients were evaluated. The ultrasonography results showed that the treatment of patients with ARDS due to bird flu H7N9 infection was remarkably effective. There was no significant difference in the lung ultrasonogram score between patients with ARDS caused by H7N9 avian influenza infection and those with pneumonia caused by other viruses or bacteria. Based on our previous experience, we monitored the morphology of the lung and the intrathoracic airways as well as assessed the status of the lung ventilation and the interstitial thickening in the peripheral lung (in the absence of pneumothorax), and the results were consistent with previous investigations [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

The characteristics of ARDS in the patients infected with H7N9 were similar to previous investigations [19] [20] [21] ; however, how to dynamically monitor the lung morphology and intrathoracic airways in patients in real-time and adjust the treatment plan for a definitive diagnosis has not been explored previously. We applied bedside lung ultrasonography to evaluate the lung injury by examining the pulmonary exudation and consolidation regions. We found that the lung ultrasonogram score was positively correlated with the severity of lung injury after H7N9 infection and that patients with severe ARDS had a greater score than other patients with multiple comet-tail signs, including the area from the posterior back to the anterior chest. Thus, the effective ventilation area reduced sharply, resulting in acute severe hypoxemia or even death. Therefore, we demonstrated that bedside lung ultrasonography can be used to observe the pulmonary morphological changes in patients infected with the H7N9 virus. In addition, the lung sonogram score and oxygenation index were negatively correlated, indicating that the sonogram score and oxygenation index similarly evaluated the patient's condition during early ARDS. Although the statistical analyses had certain limitations due to the low number of cases and the short period of treatment, it was clearly shown that the mortality rate increased if the lung sonogram score continuously exceeded 30 in 1 week, which was closely related to exudation during early ARDS.",

The correlation between the lung sonogram score and the oxygenation index was analyzed by Microsoft Excel (2007), and a negative correlation with a correlation coefficient of \u22120.782 is shown in a short period. To maintain satisfactory oxygenation, a high PEEP value during ventilation was generally used, which possibly led to tension pneumothorax, especially when lung consolidation and pulmonary fibrosis developed. Once plural effusion or pneumothorax happened, the effective ventilation area decreased dramatically so that the hypoxemia was aggravated with a fatality [24, 25] .
