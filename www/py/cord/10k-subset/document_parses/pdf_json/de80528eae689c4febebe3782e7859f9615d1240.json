This assay can directly detect 6 bacteria, 7 viruses, and 1 yeast in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in about 1 hour, enabling the rapid provision of appropriate therapy and patient management. Since implementation of the ME panel at our institution, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) has been the most frequent positive target to date. However, establishing HHV-6 as the cause of encephalitis in a given patient can be challenging, because PCR positivity alone does not necessarily imply causality. Viral nucleic acids can also be detected in other host-virus states, such as latency, asymptomatic viral reactivation, and chromosomal integration, the latter phenomenon occurring in about 1% of the population [1, 2] . In addition, HHV-6 encephalitis has been well described among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients [3, 4] but is rare outside this setting. We therefore reviewed all HHV-6-positive cases since implementation of the ME panel to evaluate the clinical significance of this finding.",

To determine the clinical significance of the cases, each reviewer performed an independent probability assessment, assigning cases to 1 of 3 categories: likely (>90% probability), possible (10%-90% probability), or unlikely (<10% probability). The reviewers then discussed their clinical interpretations together to arrive at a consensus probability assessment for each case. Data files from the positive FilmArray panels were analyzed by Biofire and categorized as low positive for crossing point values \u226526 or moderate or high positive for crossing point values <26. These data was not available at the time of patient care or the consensus probability assessment. The study was approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board RESULTS From 6 August 2016 to 15 July 2017, a total of 793 unique patients underwent testing with the ME panel, of whom 60 (7.6%) tested positive for \u22651 target. Of the 60 patients with positive results, 15 tested positive for HHV-6; HHV-6 was therefore detected in 25% of positive cases and 1.9% of all patients tested.",

Seizures and altered mental status were the most common presenting symptoms (7 patients each), followed by fever (3 patients) and headache (2 patients). The CSF samples demonstrated lymphocytic pleocytosis in 3 patients. HHV-6 plasma viral load testing was performed in 11 patients, and HHV-6 DNA was detected in 7 of the 11. Chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ciHHV-6) was tested for in 3 patients and confirmed in all 3. Cranial imaging was performed in 13 patients, showing medial temporal lobe hyperintensity on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence in 2. A formal infectious diseases consultation was obtained for 8 patients, and 6 patients received antiviral therapy (foscarnet and ganciclovir in 3 each).

The single case of likely HHV-6 encephalitis was distinguished by 3 main factors. First, the patient was an HSCT recipient and had received her transplant 3 weeks before symptom onset; HHV-6 encephalitis is well described in this patient population 2-6 weeks after transplant [3, 4] . Second, magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensities within the limbic system were consistent with the well-characterized description of HHV-6 causing limbic encephalitis [5, 6] . Third, the patient demonstrated substantial clinical and laboratory improvement shortly after the initiation of antiviral therapy. In contrast, the 12 patients in the \"unlikely\" category all had credible evidence of alternative explanations for their clinical presentations (Table 1) . HHV-6 positivity among these 12 patients is most likely explained by either chromosomal integration or subclinical reactivation of latent virus. Chromosomal integration explains the positive ME panel results for 3 patients who tested positive for ciHHV-6, but most patients did not undergo ciHHV-6 testing, so the total number with chromosomal integration could not be ascertained. With regard to subclinical reactivation, 3 of these 12 patients were immunosuppressed, and the majority of the remaining patients presented with severe acute illness, which could also cause viral reactivation. In 1 study, HHV-6 reactivation was demonstrated in 54 of 101 critically ill patients (53%) admitted to the intensive care unit, compared with 0 of 50 healthy volunteers (0%) [7] . Supplemental Table 1 shows additional data for Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus reactivation in some of these patients.",

Memory loss, confusion, and depressed consciousness are common initial symptoms [9, 10] , with overt seizures occurring in about 40%-70% of patients [8] . Recipients of solid organ transplants and other immunosuppressed patients should also be considered at higher risk, although HHV-6 encephalitis is not as well studied in these populations. Mild CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis may be seen in some patients but is not a reliable measure in patients unable to mount a robust immune response; for example, 1 series of 9 HSCT recipients with HHV-6 encephalitis showed a median CSF white blood cell count of just 5/\u03bcL (range, 1-41/\u03bcL) [5] .",

Thus, the entire clinical picture, including patients' degree of immunosuppression, symptoms, laboratory findings, and cranial imaging should all be considered when interpreting ME panel results. As laboratories adapt to newer panel-based CSF testing, significant consideration should be given to the reporting for targets like HHV-6, including interpretative comments to help guide clinical decision making. Although additional laboratory testing for viral load and chromosomal integration can provide additional supporting information, clinical judgment is ultimately paramount in determining the clinical significance of HHV-6 positivity in the CSF.",
