            "text": "We have recently found that certain rheumatoid factors (RFs) cross react with DNA-protein (DNP) . This type of cross reacting R F is frequently present in seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 21 of 58 patients, and also in order R F positive patients: rheumatoid overlap syndrome 4/10, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) 5/7, other diseases 1/10, Thus far RFs reactive with DNP have not been found in systemic lupus erythernatosus (SLE) 0/8 or essential mixed cryoglobulinemia 0/7. RFs which react with DNP can give positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) and LE tests which can be blocked by aggregated IgG or DNP. In contrast, positive ANA and LE tests in SLE are not blocked by aggregated IgG. Hence RF induced ANA and LE tests may be considered \"false\" positives when these tests are used in the diagnosis of SLE. In some sera these RFs could be detected only following isolation with insoluble IgG or DNP, suggesting the presence of RFs complexed with antigen. By use of a monoclonal R F which cross reacts with DNF in a sensitive competitive inhibition radioimmunoassay designed for detection of immune complexes (JCI 59:990, 1977) , complexes larger than 19s by ultracentrifugation studies could be detected in several RA sera and synovial fluid and MCTD sera. In some studies DNAse treatment of these complexes resulted in a decrease in size. These studies suggest that complexes consisting of DNP antigen and R F may be present in the circulation in RA and MCTD. The relationship, if any, of these complexes to the immunopathology in these diseases is currently under study. These studies also suggest that not all RFs may be induced by immune aggregated IgG and that a re-exploration of RFs in various diseases for cross reactions with non-IgC antigens is indicated, Such antigen may provide clues to etiologic factors in these diseases.",

Sera from patients with rheumatic diseases were specially selected and demonstrated to contain only antibodies to Sm antigen (5 patients), nuclear RNP (7), SS-B antigen (3), or nuclear histones (7). Column chromatography isolated-IgG from these sera were reacted with sections of mouse liver to form nuclear Ag-Ab complexes of the different specificities described above. Binding of complement components to the nuclear Ag-Ab complexes was determined after washing away excess serum and incubating with 3 different sources of complement: 1) normal human serum (NHS); 2) NHS-EGTA Mg, conditions which are known to block activation of the classic pathway; 3) immunologically Clq-depleted sera in which other complement proteins were demonstrated to be 90% hemolytically active. Fixation of complement was determined by using fluorescein-conjugated antiserum to Clq, C4, properdin, factor B, C3, C6, and C9. All sera with antibodies to Sm antigen, nuclear RNP, and SS-B nuclear antigens showed fixation of all complement proteins when NHS was used as the source of complement. When the source of complement was EGTA-Mg or Clq-depleted serum, Clq and C4 were negative by IFCF. However, complement proteins properdin, factor B, C3, C6, and C9 were positive, showing that these nuclear antigen-antibody complexes were able to fix complement proteins of the alternative pathway, without concomitant fixation of the classic pathway. The 7 sera with antibodies to nuclear histones did not fix any complement component of either the classic or alternative pathways.",

            "text": "The isolation of a bound antigenic bacterial polysaccharide primarily from rheumatoid effusions associated with diminished antibody suggests a pathogenetic role for PPS in rheumatoid arthritis possibly as an immune complex type. An in vitro system for examining the cellular requirements necessary for initiating and regulating antinucleic acid antibody responses has been developed to facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for triggering antibody responses to this group of antigens in murine and human SLE. It has been found that spontaneously appearing anti-ssDNA hemolytic plaque forming cells (PFC) can be detected when spleen cells from normal mice of different Hz types (CBA, DBA, BDF1, CFW, C57/B16) or young (4 weeks) autoimmune (NZB X NZW F1 (B/W), NZB, NZW) strains of mice are cultured under standard Mishell Dutton conditions in the absence of added antigen. Such PFC(200-2600/culture) which peak on day 5 and cannot be detected prior to culture consist entirely of specific IgM anti-ssDNA antibody. The response, which appears to be dependent on active antibody synthesis, can be selectively abolished by specific removal of ssDNA antigen binding cells, by rosette depletion. While low responses can be augmented by pokeweed mitogen, there is no obligatory requirement of serum, thymic (T) cells, or macrophages in the culture system. This in vitro response can blocked by: 1) adding small quantities of ssDNA (lO-5Opg) but not similar concentrations of DNA or RNA directly to culture on day 1; 2) pre-incubation of Spleen cells with ssDNA (1 hour) and washing prior to culture. Unblocking can be demonstrated by subsequently treating these cells with trypsin-DNAse, suggesting that this inhibition may be due to a membrane receptor blockade mechanism; 3) the addition to young B/W spleen cells of T cells from young (4 weeks) or old (> 6 months) syngeneic mice similarly abrogates this in vitro anti-ssDNA response without effecting cell viability or the anti-SRBC antibody response. On the other hand syngeneic bone marrow cells which markedly suppress the anti-SRBC antibody response have no effect on the anti-ssDNA response of these spleen cells. These in vitro studies suggest mechanisms that may be relevant to the normal regulation of anti-nucleic acid antibody and other autoantibody responses in vivo. The ability of old B/W T cells to exhibit inhibitory effects similar to those of young preautoimmune B/W mice on the in vitro antinucleic acid antibody response suggests that the suppressor potential of these old B/W T cells may be blocked in vivo. The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (ED-S) is an uncommon, genetically determined disorder of connective tissue. Of the seven clinically distinct types, a basic molecular defect has been reported in Types IV, VI, and VII, all of which are inherited by a recessive mode, and appear to be related to deficiencies in the activity of specific enzymes involved in postribosomal changes. Types I to I11 are inherited by a dominant mode and might be expected to have defects at the transcriptional level. Type V is sex-linked and has been reported to result from a cross-link deficiency. We have studied 8 patients with ED-S Type I, 3 patients with Type 11, and 3 with the X-linked Type V. The results show that the reducible crosslinks are present and undergo the same maturation process to nonreducible cross-links as in normal skin. We were unable to confirm the absence of reducible cross-links in the X-linked type ED-S. The ability of the ED-S skin to produce apparently normal cross-linked collagen was supported by cell and tissue culture studies. Transmission electron micr~scopy and optical birefringence revealed a normal ultrastructure of the collagen fibrils. At a higher morphological level of organization scanning electron microscopy demonstrated a gradual increase in fiber bundle disorder from the X-linked to the myasthenia gravis, where the fibers making up the large fiber bundles demonstrated a considerable inability to aggregate. This disorder could account for the prolonged lag phase in the stressstrain curves, while the presence of cross-links ensures that once stress is on the individual fibers the elasting modulus is normal and the skin can return to normal after hyperextension. The absence of cross-links would lead to an irreversible elongation of the fiber. The low breaking point of the fiber is therefore due to the lack of integrity of the fiber bundles and suggests that the defect lies at a higher order of organization.",

Lymphocyte-reactive antibodies in SLE sera also recognized antigens on neuronal cells. To determine whether the membrane fragments in the cryos have the antigenic determinants shared with neurons, antisera generated against 12 SLE cryos were tested in an antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay by use of 61Cr-labeled human neuronal cells, SK-N-SH, as targets and normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) as effectors. The anti-cryos produced 9.7 f 3.8 mean % \"Cr-release. Two of the antisera were strongly positive at 35 and 38% cytotoxicity, and 3 others were modestly cytotoxic in the range of 8.3 to 12.4%. The remaining antisera were not significantly different from the controls; 1.3 f 0.3% '0-release from 12 normal rabbit sera (NRS), and 1.7 f 0.5% cytotoxicity from a control group consisting of 4 non-SLE anti-cryos. The antibody activity was not linked to SK-N-S H cells. The same sera reacted with human neuronal line, LA-N-1, and 2 human glial lines, A-I72 and U-l18MG. Unexpectedly there was no correlation between reactivity against the neuronal cells and antibody activity against normal human PBL. Antibody t o PBL was not detected in 4/5 anti-cryos with neuronal antibody, and 2 of the antisera unreactive with SK-N-SH had anti-PBL activity. Absorption of the anti-cryo reactive against both SK-N-SH and PBL with the human lymphoblast line WLL2 removed all anti-PBL activity but not the neuronal reactivity. Absorption with SK-N-SH eliminated the neuronal reactivity and also diminished the antibody to PBL. The antineuronal activity was not removed by absorptions with human platelets and human RBC. Passage of the anticryos over immunoglobulin containing immunoabsorbents removed the detectable anti-immunoglobulin activity without diminishing the neuronal reactivity. Thus, SLE cryoproteins contain antigenic determinants shared by neuronal and glial cells but not by the major cellular elements in blood. It is not yet clear whether those antigens are present on fragments of neuronal membranes or on antigenic structures eliciting cross reactive antibodies.",

By electron microscopy, mesangial, subendothelial, intramembranous and/or subepithelial electron dense deposits were found. A single biospy in which only C3 was found to be deposited, consistent with activation via the alternative pathway, was also studied, as was one patient with Goodpasture's syndrome, whose biopsy contained linear deposits of proteins along the glomerular basement membrane. Six specimens from patients with such nonimmune renal diseases as arteriolar nephrosclerosis and acute tubular necrosis were also examined. By use of direct immunofluorescence with anti-BlH specifically shown to be free of any contaminating anti-C3, deposits of B1H were found in every instance (14 of 14 exams) in which C3 deposits were observed. This was true regardless of the underlying disease which resulted in the C3 deposits. The spatial distribution of P l H within the glomerulus was often congruent with the distribution of C3 in the same tissue, suggesting that these two proteins were intimately associated.

The altered ratio of sIg isotypes was not a consequence of increased proteolytic activity present in NZB cell suspensions since the addition of NZB cells to iodinated BALB/c cells did not alter the BALB/c ratio of sIgM/sIgD. It was not due to the presence of cytophilic antibody or autoanti-body since the sIgM was found to have a sedimentation coefficient of 8s and was thus not of serum origin. When examined by fluorescence microscopy or by cytofluorometry, NZB spleen cells were found to have normal numbers of sIgM+ and sIgDf cells, indicating that the altered sIgM/sIgD ratio observed in the radioiodination experiments was due to abnormal densities of these isotypes on B cells rather than to the absence of an IgD-bearing B cell subset. The increased sIgM/sIgD ratio may be a consequence of in vivo polyclonal B cell activation, since in vitro polyclonal activation of m o p e spleen cells has been shown to alter this ratio in a similar manner. Since the increased ratio was noted as early as 6 weeks, these data provide support for the concept that polyclonal B cell activation precedes the onset of autoimmune disease in NZB mice.",

Neither preparation contained ss DNA assessed by HAP elution. Poly dAT was entirely duplex as assessed by EBr fluorescence but our n-DNA contained 15% ss regions within the predominantly duplex molecules. Under optimal conditions each serum showed consistently less binding to poly dAT than to n-DNA. A significant correlation was seen between the binding to poly dAT and n-DNA (r = 0.91, P < 0.01).

MCF stimulation of collagenase production by ASC is enhanced by addition of low concentrations of indomethacin (indo), 1 nM; such concentrations of indo block PGE, synthesis > 5Wo even in the presence of MCF. At higher indo concentrations (1-10 fiM) which inhibit PGE, synthesis -1008, collagenase stimulation is usually inhibited by -60%. In some ASC stimulated with MCF, this inhibition by indo (10 pM) is reversed by addition of small amounts of PGE, (10 ng/ml). Addition of these small amounts of PGE, results in augmentation of collagenase stimulation to levels greater than those seen when cells are stimulated with MCF alone. Addition of larger amounts of PGE, (1 pg/ml) under these conditions tends to inhibit collagenase. ASC respond to exogenous PGE, with increased levels of CAMP. MCF also modulates this cAMP response: preincubation of ASC with either indo or MCF plus indo augments cAMP response to exogenous P G b .

By use of a two-stage microcytotoxicity assay with a panel of 30 alloantisera, the frequencies of various B-cell alloantigens in patients with RA were compared to those of control populations, including patients with multiple sclerosis. Three B-cell alloantisera were identified that gave particularly high frequencies of reactivity with RA patients. Delineation of the specificity of these 3 alloantisera on a panel of 36 B-cell lines derived from individuals homozygous for MLC alleles revealed that reactions were obtained only with those lines from individuals that were positive for HLA-Dw4, Dw7, or DwlO. Absorption of the alloantisera with B-cell lines from Dw4, Dw7, or DwlO positive individuals eliminated the seroreactivity with all B-cell lines having any of these three de-terminants, thus demonstrating that the alloantisera react with a B-cell antigen common to cells with either of the three MLC specificities. MLC testing of the RA patients with a panel of normal homozygous cells defined in the Seventh International Histocompatibility Workshop revealed an increase in the frequencies of HLA-Dw4 and DwlO as compared to controls (26% versus 14.6% and 13% versus 6.9%, respectively), while the frequency of HLA-Dw7 was not significantly different (23% versus 18.6%). The individuals who were negative for the HLA-D alleles Dw4, Dw7, and DwlO by conventional MLC testing yet positive for the shared B-cell alloantigenic specificity were of particular interest. The results indicate that a shared antigenic specificity exists among alleles of B-cell alloantigens that is, in turn, partially related to particular MLC alleles. Thus susceptibility to RA may be a function of the inheritance of the molecules bearing this antigenic specificity.",

When MSU crystals are coated with IgG (as occurs in plasma), stimulation is markedly enhanced. These studies, using MSU induced human platelet serotonin secretion as a model, examined the nature of cellular recognition mechanisms for the IgG-coated MSU crystal and the uncoated crystal. F(ab')2 fragments of specific anti Fc antibody blocked and the lipopolysaccharide of S minnesota R595 enhanced human platelet secretion induced by IgG-coated urate crystals. These agents had little effect on stimulation by uncoated crystals. This indicated that urate crystals stimulate platelets independently of fluid phase IgG. Urate crystals directly stimulated suspensions of washed rabbit platelets which lack Fc receptors. In contrast to human cells, stimulation was blocked by IgG. This again demonstrated IgG-independent cell stimulation by urate crystals. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals could trigger human platelet secretion only when coated with IgG. This suggests that when crystals were coated with IgG, the surfacebound IgG alone may be the stimulus to the cell. This was confirmed by the finding that polyvinyl pyridine-N-oxide, a hydrogen acceptor, blocked human platelet stimulation by uncoated but not IgG-coated urate crystals. In contrast to IgG, F(ab')2 fragments, IgM, or IgA did not enhance human platelet stimulation by urate crystals. This indicates that the effect of IgG on urate crystal stimulation of platelets depends on the Fc region of IgG. These data demonstrate that urate crystals (and potentially other surfaces or particles) can stimulate a mediator cell by at least two mechanisms: by direct stimulation without the mediation of absorbed IgG or when coated with IgG, by triggering the cell via Fc receptors.",

Controls in both laboratories consisted of similar cocultivations using cultures derived from nonrheumatoid membranes. All cocultivations were maintained for 2-3 months without subculture, during which time small foci of heaped-up cells were observed. By electron microscopy, all the rheumatoid cultures (15) but none of the control cultures (7) showed VLPs. These appeared as spherical bodies with a spike-like external array, seen both in sonicated negatively stained (PTA) preparations, and in thin sections of harvested RSC cocultivations.

Their morphology resembled that of budding RNA viruses, although coronaviruses and myxoparamyxoviruses may also show these characteristics in certain situations. Similar particles have not been previously demonstrated in RSC. Serial passage of cocultivation extracts containing VLPs onto other cell types resulted in repeated transient cytopathic effects. Extracts of the RSC cocultivations were injected into suckling mouse brains, resulting in a reproducible illness not observed when control extracts were similarly injected.

Treatment of the antigen with RNAse resulted in a 1,000-fold or greater decrease in titer in 18 patients and a 64-fold decrease in one. Rheumatoid factors were present in 8 patients and antinuclear antibodies in 12. All patients had a mixed rheumatic syndrome. Clinical features included: Raynaud's phenomenon-16, swollen hands and/or sclerodactyly-12, myopathy-1 I , pleuritis--12, malar or diffuse rash-7, and arthritis-15. One patient had a stable IgA membranous glomerulopathy. IC were measured in 46 sera by a Raji cell radioassay (RC-RA), monoclonal rheumatoid factor radioimmunoassay (MRF-RIA), and Clq binding assay (Clq-BA). IC were detected by at least one method in 45 (98%) sera. The single negative serum was from a patient with clinically inactive disease.

A serial study of the correlation of defective RES Fc receptor function, immune complexes, and disease activity was undertaken to further investigate the interaction of these factors. Isologous Yr-labeled erythrocytes were sensitized with human anti-Rh(D) and their intravenous clearance determined. Clearance rates (T-1/2) C' levels and IC levels by 1z51-Clq precipitation were determined prior to therapy in 17 SLE patients, 12 of whom had active disease. Fifteen of 17 had markedly prolonged clearance rates (range = 80 to > 1 ,OOO minutes; average clearance T-1/2 in 14 normal volunteers = 40 minutes, range 35 to 50 minutes). The correlations of clinical activity with 1) Clq binding and 2) prolonged clearance were statistically sig-nificant (P < 0.005 and P < 0.05, respectively; Spearman Rank Coefficient). In addition, elevated Clq binding and depressed C4 levels were significantly correlated (P < 0.05).

Patients had been treated with either corticosteroids (7 of 10) or nonsteroidal, antiinflammatory drugs (3 of 10). Clinically, 7 of 10 were improved; the remaining 3 continued to do well. Although a clearance defect persisted in all 10 (T-1/2 from 88 to 600 minutes), in 7 of 10 T-1/2 was markedly improved, suggesting improved Fc receptor function. In 7 patients, there was an apparent correlation between increased clearance and clinical improvement.

Onset and duration of action of all agents were similar except Ac and PI, which required longer to act and lasted a shorter time.

With the conditions described above, potassium urate crystals were much less active (8%) than sodium urate (31%). Eight different commercially available preparations of steroids gave varying but small amounts of C3 activation (-1 t o 5%). It is demonstrated that different crystals and altered forms of the same crystals vary in their interaction with serum and their ability to activate complement. It is not known what properties are responsible for these phenomena. The calcium requirement suggests that the interaction of sodium urate with complement occurs at or before C1.

One of these subjects had clinical symptoms suggestive of SLE and the drug was stopped. Five subjects have shown a proliferative lymphocyte response to hydralazine and/or its metabolites (JCI 56:958, 1975) including the 3 with positive ANF.

Photographs were taken and subsequently reviewed in a randomized double-blind manner by both the endoscopist (FL) and an impartial gastroenterologist (RN). Remarkably consistent results were obtained: Part I. Forty volunteers were randomly divided into 8 groups with 5 subjects in each group and treated for 1 week with either Motrin (2400 mg/day), Motrin (1600 mg/day), Indocin (1 50 mg/day), Indocin (100 mg/day), Naprosyn (750 mg/day), Naprosyn (500 mg/day), aspirin (3.6 gm/day), and placebo.

Based on amino acid composition and sequence of bovine bone Gla-protein, osteocalcin is distinct from all other vitamin K dependent clotting proteins (factors 11, VII, IX, and X) synthesized in the liver. The posttranslational formation of Gla, studied extensively in liver microsomes from warfarin treated rats, occurs in a vitamin K dependent enzymatic oxidative carboxylation of selected glutamic acid residues in prothrombin requiring bicarbonate ion and NADH or chemical reducing agent. To show that Gla synthesis occurs in bone tissue and that the carboxylase enzyme has similar requirements in bone, microsomes were prepared from the long bones of 17 day old chick embryos. The eggs were injected at 12, 14, and 16 days with sodium warfarin, an inhibitor of Gla synthesis, to allow for the accumulation of endogenous substrate available for specific labeling with NaH14COB. The microsomes separated from bone homogenates by differential centrifugation incorporated 14C into Gla only in the presence of vitamin K1. \"C-Gla was identified after alkaline hydrolysis of the microsomes and separation on an amino acid analyzer. Further confirmation of \"C-Gla was obtained by acid hydrol-ysis of the putative Gla component resulting in decarboxylation to glutamic acid and recovery of approximately 50% of the incorporated radioactivity in glutamic acid. The posttranslational enzymatic generation of specific calcium binding sites in bone suggests that the vitamin K dependent carboxylation reaction may have a possible role in regulating mineral deposition in calcified tissues. Since the formation of a specific calcium binding amino acid in bone is vitamin K dependent, anomalies might be expected to occur in mineralized tissues under conditions of vitamin K deficiency or anticoagulant therapy. Of significance is the finding of Gla-containing proteins in ectopic calcifications (subcutaneous scleroderma and dermatomyositis plaques, atheromatous plaque) which suggests Gla may be important in the formation and resorption of bone in a wide variety of disorders.",

Six patients experienced joint pain affecting chiefly knees but also shoulder, ankle, and temporomandibular joints. Arthralgias were variable in severity and duration, and in time of onset after transplantation. In 2 patients pain coincided with reduction of steroid dosage and was abolished by modifying the treatment regimen. A third patient, who developed transient joint pain 17 days after appearance of a painless effusion, had hyperparathyroidism. Joint effusions, confirmed by arthrocentesis, appeared in 18 knees of 11 patients. Mean duration from transplantation to first joint aspiration was 17 days. Effusions were generally unaccompanied by pain, except on extreme flexion, and persisted for 24 hours to 6 weeks. Twenty-five synovial fluid samples were obtained from the 18 knees. The mean synovial fluid volume was 15 ml (range, 3-65 ml) and the mean cell count was 28/mma (range 0-150/mms). In every case viscosity and mucin test were normal and crystals were not found on polarization microscopy of the centrifuged fluids. Joint x-rays showed only soft tissue swelling.

Neither the arthralgias nor effusions bore any apparent relationship to the source of the donor kidney, renal function, fever, or use of anti-thymocyte globulin. No major transplant rejection episodes occurred in any of the patients with effusions or arthralgias, whereas no joint problems arose in any of 9 patients who rejected donor kidneys in the postoperative period.

Now an attempt is made to support this finding by examining the glomerular immune deposits in SLE-DPGN for evidence of type C virus antibody. Human immunoglobulins (Igs) were eluted from the glomerular immune deposits in two fractions by sequential treatment with DNase to elute anti-DNA antibodies, followed by acid buffer to elute remaining antibodies. The eluted Igs were then assayed by a sensitive, specific, and quantitative enzymoimmunoassay, which compares favorably with radioimmunoassay, for the detection and measurement of anti-p30 antibody against purified p30 proteins of the four chief groups of mammalian type C viruses: murine, feline, endogenous feline RD-I 14/endogenous primate, and simian sarcoma virus type I (SSV-I)/infectious primate virus groups. Human Igs which showed specific anti-p30 antibody activity, particularly against p30 antigen of the RD-I 14 virus group and to lesser extent against p30 antigen of the murine and SSV-I virus groups, was eluted by acid buffer from the glomerular immune deposits in two cases of SLE-DPGN that were known from previous study to contain deposits of viral p30-related antigen in the same tissue lesions. These findings support the hypothesis, stemming from studies of the New Zealand mouse model of SLE, that subinfectious antigenic expression of a type C virus is involved in the pathogenesis of DPGN associated with SLE.",

Pretreatment of 10 sera with 0.01 M 2mercaptoethanol to dissociate IgM into monomers resulted in the eradication of rheumatoid factor as measured by BFT but caused only slight to moderate reductions in ClqBA. Thus circulating immune complexes exist in many patients with SS, are distinct from rheumatoid factor, and may contribute to certain aspects of tissue damage in this disease.",

In this study we determined the Blymphocyte antigens of 24 patients (21 females and 3 males, ages 26 to 73) and 184 normal controls. In addition to SS, 3 of the patients have rheumatoid arthritis and 3 have systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunoglobulin-bearing lymphocytes were separated from heparinized peripheral blood on goat anti-human IgG (Fab) coated plastic plates and tested with 60 antisera in complement dependent cytotoxicity tests. The antisera used were obtained from multiparous women and absorbed with pooled platelets to remove HLA-A, -B, and -C antibodies. Two antisera, 172 and AGS, reacted with the B-lymphocytes from all the SS patients compared to 37 and 24% of the normal controls, respectively. Four additional antisera (35,350,590, and 715) reacted more frequently (67,63,58, and 54%) with the patients' B-cells than with those of controls (17, 21,24, and 14%) . The remainder of the antisera tested had the same frequency of reactivity in this disease as in normals. T o determine if these antisera recognized the same or different antigens, their reactions with the lymphocytes from the normal controls were compared by the x ' test. Antisera 172 correlated with both 35 and 350 but not with AGS or 715. Antisera AGS correlated only with 7 15. Similar statistical analysis was done for the patients. The antisera 172 and AGS were excluded because of their 100% prevalance in SS. In the SS patient group antisera 35, 350, and 590 were associated with each other but not with 715. This association can be due t o either cross-reactivity or linkage disequilibrium. Family studies are in progress to determine whether SS patients can be heterozygous for 172 and AGS and, if so, whether they can be present in trans position. Assuming that the B-lymphocyte antigens in humans are coded by loci of an Ir region, our results suggest that two immune response genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of SS. In addition, the absolute association of 172 and AGS antigens with these patients should provide a n additional aid in diagnosis of SS.",

We have made permanent R A synovial lymphoblastoid cell lines capable of producing unlimited quantities of antibody. R A synovial membranes were obtained surgically, finely minced in medium (RPMI 1640, 20% fetal calf serum, glutamine, antibiotics), placed in 60mm Linbro plates, infected with Epstein-Barr virus, incubated (37OC, air + 5% CO,) and fed weekly. Typical lymphoblastoid cell lines developed in 13 of 43 (32%) cultures after a mean 33 days, range 18-53. Once established, the cell lines were put in large flasks and medium changed completely 3 times a week. Eight of the 13 permanent lines were lost after a mean duration of 54 days (range 7-120) due to bacterial contamination or poor viability. The latter was due to suboptimal growth support by specific lots of RPMI or serum; subsequently these were pretested. The 5 remaining lymphoblastoid lines now have a mean duration of 159 days (range 120-210), during which their mean volume was 207 ml (range 98-332). Maximum volume was 1.4 liters, but could be expanded indefinitely in 2 liters or larger flasks on shaker platforms at low speed. Mean cell doubling time was 34 hours, range 24-48. IgG concentration in harvested supernatant medium was measured sequentially by a radioimmunoassay described previously. Mean IgG production by each line was 55, 246,420,426, and 1405 pg IgG/day, decreasing slowly with time. Adjusted for cell concentration, mean production was 0.9, 3.9, 4.6, 5.8, and 9.7 pg IgG/IV cells/day. Total production to date was 2.418, 29.061, 36.684, 50.768, and 59 .0 milligrams. The culture producing the lowest amount may be producing a predominance of another immunoglobulin type. In 3 of 5 lines IgG production tended to be significantly higher when cell concentration was lower (r =0.465 -0.673; P < 0.001). These RA lines produced more IgG than previously reported for lymphoblastoid lines derived from other human tissues (1-3 Bg/lP cells/day). They also produced 5-10 times more IgG than our previous batch organ cultures of RA synovia. Their increased IgG production may be due to improved culture conditions and/or intrinsic immunologic hyperactivity of RA lymphocytes. These cultures may provide an excellent source of antibody specific for the antigen(s) inciting RA.",

Patients were defined as having SS if they exhibited objective evidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. All were assessed by history, physical examination, Schirmer test, Rose Bengal staining of the cornea and bulbar conjunctiva, and if possible a serial salivary scintiscan, serologic studies, and a lip biopsy. Of the 50 patients seen, 13 were identified as having SS. Of these, all 13 had a history of xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca, while 12 had a positive Schirmer test, 5 had positive staining with Rose Bengal, and 3 had a markedly abnormal salivary gland scan. Three had a positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and 1 anti-salivary duct antibody. Of the 13 with SS, 6 had adequate lip biopsies.

All patients fulfilled at least 4 ARA preliminary criteria for SLE and had antinuclear antibodies in their serum. Three patients had drug-induced SLE. Synovial fluid volumes varied from 0.75-25 cc; leukocyte counts ranged from 875-58,000 but only 3 were over 15,000.

Joint fluid LE cells were found in 8 patients while 12 had extracellular hematoxylin bodies, and 4 had a variety of other smaller eosinophilic, hematoxyphilic, or cellular inclusions. LE cells were identified by electron microscope in 10 patients. The major and often sole visible constituent of the inclusion was a clump of short filaments about 200 nm in diameter. These lay in vacuoles which also contained acid phosphatase. These filaments which appear to be products of nuclear chromatin also were seen extracellularly surrounding some cells and in smaller vacuoles. Small acid phosphatase positive vacuoles also contained cell cytoplasmic debris, intact nucleii, erythrocyte fragments, and large amounts of finely granular protein-like material. The finely granular material was shown t o contain IgG by immunoperoxidase electron microscope staining. T R S were found in 8 synovial fluids and were predominantly in mononuclear cells with dense bodies and rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Although considerable information is available as to the effect of drugs and mediators of inflammation on collagenase production and activity, the mechanisms during aging in the collagen fibril causing increased resistance to collagenase degradation are poorly understood. In this study, the effect of collagen cross-linking on collagenolysis was measured with an in vitro model system consisting of purified chick calvarium collagen fibrils and lysyl oxidase, the cross-linking enzyme. Chick calvatia collagen fibrils were cross-linked by incubation with lysyl oxidase for varying time. Controls consisted of collagen incubated without enzyme or with lysyl oxidase plus /3-aminopropionitrile, an irreversible inhibitor. The fibrils were subsequently measured for nascent cross-link content or incubated with purified rheumatoid synovial collagenase, and the rate of collagenolysis was measured. After synthesis of approximately 0.1 Schiff base cross-links per collagen molecule, a ten-fold resistance to collagenase digestion was observed. Inhibition of collagenase by EDTA prevented digestion. Synthesis of collagen fibrils with higher cross-link content resulted in further resistance. These results demonstrate that the increased resistance of collagen to collagenolysis observed during fibril maturation in vivo is due to synthesis of native, unreduced Schiff base cross-links. The cross-link content at which resistance to degradation develops is significantly less than that which affects fibril tensile strength in vivo. This suggests that resistance to collagenase is the earliest physiological effect of cross-linking in vivo. The rate of cross-link synthesis may be a significant factor regulating the rate of net collagen deposition in normal and pathologic states. ",

Structurally unrelated CFs, some shown to bind to distinct cell receptors, can cross-deactivate, which suggests that deactivation is not due to receptor blockade. We propose that deactivation is the result of generalized microtubule assembly induced by C F incubated with the cells in the absence of a gradient, thus rendering the cells incapable of responding to a C F gradient with distinctive localized assembly, a proposed requirement of normal chemotaxis. If this scheme is correct, the simultaneous preincubation of PMNs with suitable concentrations of colchicine, a microtubule disrupting agent, and a C F should protect the cell against deactivation and colchicine-induced suppression of chemotaxis. Human neutrophils were preincubated, 20' at 37OC, with colchicine to 10-'M); the chemotactic factors Gly-His-Gly (IOpg) or crystalinduced chemotactic factor (CCF) 25pg alone; colchicine and either chemotactis factor; or Hanks. Cells were washed and tested for chemotactic response against the C F using a radioassay that utilizes Y r labeled neutrophils. Preincubation of cells with either chemotactic factor or colchicine alone resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of chemotaxis. When cells were preincubated with both chemotactic factor (Gly-His-Gly IOpg or CCF 20pg) and suitable concentrations of colchicine ( or IO-O), a reversal of the inhibition of chemotaxis was noted.",

Neutrophils stimulated at sites of inflammation release lysosomal enzymes. Experimentally, a variety of agents are capable of stimulating neutrophils to release their lysosomal enzymes. Neutrophil membranes contain Fc receptors for IgG, and thereby possess surface bound IgG. In these studies we examined the hypothesis that specific antibodies could combine with surface bound IgG, perturb the cell membrane, and provoke inflammatory responses of neutrophils. Antisera were raised to immunoglobulins G , M, A, D, E, and isolated y chains, Fc and F(ab'), of IgG. These were rendered monospecific by solid phase immunoabsorbents. Isolated normal human peripheral blood neutrophils were incubated with specific antisera and the release of lysosomal /3-glucuronidase, a-mannosidase, and lysozyme were measured. Non-lethal release of lysosomal enzymes was observed with antisera to whole IgG, IgA and t o y and Fc of IgG. The IgG fraction of anti-IgG antiserum also stimulated non-lethal release, thereby suggesting that the response was not complement-mediated. Specific IgG and IgA receptors were detected on neutrophils using immunofluorescent labeled antibodies. N o such receptors were detected for IgM and IgD. These results indicate that inflammatory responses of neutrophils can be triggered directly by anti-immunoglobulins, and suggest one mechanism for initiation of the inflammatory response in patients with diseases characterized by the presence of antibodies to IgG and other immunoglobulins.",

The present experiments were designed t o investigate in vitro interactions between PMN and joint collagenous tissues obtained from rabbit joints with experimental arthritis or control tissues from saline or monosodium urate crystal-injected joints. Experimental and control articular cartilage samples and menisci obtained from such animals were incubated for 1 hour with normal PMN isolated from rabbit peritoneal exudates or blood.

Since a semi-quantitative capillary precipitin technique was employed in that study, in which only very high CRP concentrations were regarded as positive, we investigated the significance of lesser increases in serum CRP concentration in patients with SLE, using a quantitative radial immunodiffusion method sensitive to 1.5 pg/ml. We retrospectively determined CRP concentrations in 141 serum samples collected from a group of 17 patients with SLE over a mean period of 19 months. Thirtytwo episodes of significant increase in serum CRP concentration were detected. Careful review of clinical findings associated with each CRP peak revealed that these episodes were associated with active lupus without infection in 20 instances (median CRP concentration 21 pg/ml, mean 43.7, range 7.8-197.2) In 9 instances, elevations of serum CRP concentration were attributed to proven or suspected superimposed infection or bone fracture (median 45 pg/ml, mean 52.6, range 16.3-118.2). Three CRP elevations of 7.3, 8.2 and 39.4 pg/ml occurred at a time when there was clinical evidence of neither lupus activation nor infection.",

Though indirect action, to be capable of inducing cartilage proteoglycan degraevidence has incriminated cell mediated immunologic events in dation (Arthritis Rheum 20922, 1977) and b) a non-monocytedependent, LK-induced inhibition of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis by chondrocytes in explant cultures as gauged by radio-labeled sulfate incorporation (Clin Res 25615, 1977). In the current study, an experimental model has been developed to assess the effect of LK on chondrocyte GAG synthesis at a histologic level. LK, its presence documented by MIF detection employing rabbit alveolar macrophages, was generated in 72 hour cultures by pulse PHA-P stimulation of rabbit splenocytes substantially depleted of monocytes by surface adherence. Controls comprised media or cells cultured alone and mitogen pulsed cells maintained at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were subsequently dialyzed, lyophilyzed, and reconstituted to original volume with fresh F-12 media supplemented with 15% FCS. Test and control supetnatants were incubated for varying time periods with rabbit auricular cartilage explants that had been enzymatically depleted of GAG content by limited tryptic digestion. Analogous media was replaced each 48-72 hours. Explants were subsequently stained with H & E, toluidine blue, and safranin 0 and processed for electron microscopy. Results indicated that explant exposure to LK significantly diminished chondrocyte GAG regenerative capacity. This inhibitory effect was reversible in that synthetic activity could be restored if LK supernatants were replaced with control media following as long as 12 days of LK exposure. Histologic results thus corroborate earlier biochemical observations of the modulatory capacity of LK on chondrocyte synthetic function and suggest their potential significance in the pathogenesis of cartilage degradation.",

            "text": "Intestinal bypass surgery has become a successful means of effecting weight reduction in morbid obesity. As a complication of surgery, a fraction of patients develop an arthritis and tenosynovitis which may be associated with circulating cryoproteins. We have had the opportunity to study 6 patients with post-jejunoileostomy arthritis, all of whom had, as a striking feature of the illness, a widespread dermatitis.The patients were all female. The arthritis developed from 12 to 62 months after surgery and predilected both large and small joints of the upper and lower-extremities. Associated with the arthritis were erythematous macules, ranging in size from 2 to 12 mm in diameter. These lesions developed into papules over 2 days, subsequently became pustular-vesicular, and predilected arms, legs, trunk, and face. Lesions were found in different stages of evolution.Cryoglobulins consisting of IgG, IgM, and C3, C4 were found in 3 of 4 patients. Immune complexes (Raji cell) were found in 3 of 3 patients, including 1 patient with absent cryoglobulins. Synovial fluid analysis in 3 patients revealed California WBC ranging from 1200 to 5800 with from 20 to 75% PMN. Immune complexes (Raji cell) were found in 3 of 3 synovial fluids.Excisional biopsies of the skin lesions were performed in 3 patients. There were no areas of fat necrosis. Small capillaries and venules were infiltrated with PMN in all cases.Immunofluorescent stains revealed deposits of IgG and C3-C4 in vessel walls in 1 of 3 patients. Fluorescein conjugated antisera against 5 bacterial pathogens revealed no staining in 1 patient. Treatment with oral antibiotics was initiated in all patients but was not invariably successful in decreasing the dermatitis or arthritis. In 2 patients, intravenous antibiotics were also unsuccessful, but oral prednisone was promptly followed by decreased dermatitis-arthritis. In responsive patients, the serum cryoprotein titer decreased; the kinetics of this decrease and the reappearence of the cryoprotein after stopping antibiotic-prednisone treatment was studied.Post-intestinal bypass surgery may cause a systemic immune complex disease primarily involving joints and skin. Each met at least 4 SLE classification criteria, had 2 clinical criteria of disease activity, and had elevated serum DNA binding (30-93% by Farr assay). Three had low serum hemolytic complement levels (62-89 U). Their drug regimen, including prednisone (20-45 mg/day), remained stable for 2 I days prior to, during, and for 28 days after Frentizole therapy. Rash (4 of 6), synovitis (4 of 6), mucosal ulcers (3 of 3), and pleurisy (1 of 1) improved during Frentizole therapy. Synovitis worsened in 1 case. The only toxicity was transient SGOT and SGPT elevation in 2 cases. Bone marrow and skin tests were not suppressed by the drug. Frentizole had no effect on hemoglobin concentration, creatinine clearance, or urinary protein ex-response. Other laboratory findings (mean f SEM) are summarized in the table.",

Mean disease duration was 5.3 years (range 2 months to 16 years, median 5 years). There were 34 girls and 1 1 boys, less of a female preponderance than that of most adult series. Youngest age for onset of systemic complaints was 4 years. Ten of 11 boys had disease onset prior to sexual maturation, whereas disease began after menarche in ADCC activity between patient cells and control cells when either the mixed mononuclear population or monocyte-depleted population were studied as effectors. The monocyteenriched fraction from patients with RA, however, mediated a significantly increased degree of cytotoxicity (Table) . Enhanced cytotoxicity was more evident at low effector: target ratios and was independent of phagocytosis. ADCC may be important in RA since it reflects both humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms. The enhanced effector function of the peripheral blood monocyte in this system may be an indication that mononuclear phagocytes are \"activated\" in patients with RA.",

            "text": "The ARA Preliminary Criteria for the Classification of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were developed before the widespread use of tests for anti-DNA antibodies and serum C3 levels. Analysis of our data suggests that these tests should be included in the ARA Criteria and could replace 2 of the present 14 manifestations which are less specific and less sensitive than the serum C3 level and circulating anti-native DNA antibody level (a-DNA).Three thousand three hundred thirty-four sera from 98 SLE patients were studied. Only patients observed by us and whose sera were tested both during periods of remission and disease activity were included in this study. An average of 34 serum samples per patient was studied. The average period of observation was 38.4 months. Patients had at least 4 of the 14 manifestations of the ARA Criteria. C3 levels and a-DNA were studied from 59 normal individuals, 118 patients with rheumatoid arthritis followed by us, and from patients with other diseases.Two of the non-SLE patients (1%) had a-DNA level (expressed as % DNA bound) of more than 41% (46%,52%). Thus, a a-DNA of >41% binding had a specificity for SLE of 99%. Eighty-two percent of the SLE patients had a-DNA of >41% binding as their highest value-a sensitivity of 82%. None of the non-SLE patients had a C3 of <71 mg%-a specificity of 100%. Fifty-five percent of the SLE patients had a C3 level of <7 1 mg% as their lowest C3-a sensitivity of 54%.These data were analyzed using the method employed to select the 14 manifestations of the ARA Criteria. The average rate of correct classification (the arithmetic mean of the sensitivity and specificity) (ARCC) for a-DNA of >41% binding is 90.5 and for C3 of <71 mg% is 77. The ARCC for the 22 items which comprise the 14 manifestations of the ARA Criteria varied from 52.0 to 94.9. Of these, only the presence of LE cells had a ARCC greater than that for a-DNA. If C3 and a-DNA data had been available at the time the ARA Criteria were developed, they would have been included. The ARCC for the mean of the 2 items combined for the CNS manifestations and the ARCC for the mean of the hematologic items were lower than those for either C3 or a-DNA. Thus, the C3 and the a-DNA could replace these 2 manifestations. The data suggest that the ARA Criteria should be revised.The significance of ischemic necrosis of bone (INB) in SLE and the cause of the bony lesion are not established. In this study, 36 patients with SLE and INB have been compared to 124 patients with SLE alone; and, in those with INB, the cause of the osseous lesion has been analyzed in relation to medical versus surgical management.Those clinical features of SLE significantly correlated with INB include Raynaud's phenomenon (61% versus 13%, P < O.OOl), myositis (25% versus 7%, P < O.Ol), and vasculitis (50% versus 26%, P < 0.025). The course of 73 INB sites in the 36 patients initially grouped into medical (20 patients; 41 sites) and surgical (I6 patients; 32 sites) is shown in the table.The initial orthopedic procedure was uniformly core decompression. All patients were receiving corticosteroids. The failure of medical management alone is shown by the persistence of symptoms (39 or 95%), x-ray progression (35 or 85%), and need for reconstructive surgery (22 or 53%). In stages I1 and 111 of the surgical group, only 7 sites (25%) were symptomatic, 5 sites (17%) progressed on x-ray, and only 3 (10%) required further surgery. None in stage I advanced.Differences in followup intervals would not appear to explain these statistically significant differences.Thus, in the steroid-treated SLE patient, especially with Raynaud's, myositis, and/or vasculitis, the risk of INB is major and the need for early diagnosis essential if progression of the bony lesion is to be retarded by orthopedic intervention.

            "text": "Acute abdominal syndromes have been increasingly recognized as major life-threatening events in patients with rheumatic disease. Early diagnosis is critical to the institution of appropriate medical/surgical management and may be impeded by the masking effects of antiinflammatory, especially steroidal, therapy. It is our purpose here to report those features, clinical and laboratory, which appear to relate specifically to intraabdominal arteritis, our major cause of an acute abdomen in those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and polyarteritis (PA).During the past 7 years, 15 of 140 patients admitted to the Unit with SLE and 4 of 8 patients with PA developed an acute abdomen. In 1 I (73%) of those with SLE and all 4 with PA, the abdominal event was secondary to mesenteric arteritis. The remaining 4 patients with SLE had polyserositis (2), pancreatitis ( I ) and, in the other patient, an undiagnosed recurrent syndrome which responded each time to increased corticosteroids alone. When patients with SLE and an acute abdomen were compared to the 125 patients without abdominal syn-dromes, the significant discriminating features in the abdominal group were increased peripheral vasculitis (57% versus 25%, P < 0.025), thrombocytopenia (57% versus 19%, P < O.OOOS), and presence of rheumatoid factor by the Latex test system (92% versus 45%, P < 0.0005). Of the 4 patients with PA, peripheral neuropathy was present in all, thrombocytopenia developed concomitant with the abdominal syndrome in all, and rheumatoid factor was uniformly present in the 3 patients tested (1 : 1280, 1 : 1280, I : 10,240). Eight of those with SLE and the 4 with PA died from the abdominal catastrophe. Six of the 7 surviving SLE patients represent those most recently seen.Thus, in the patients with SLE and PA, the presence of thrombocytopenia and circulating rheumatoid factor are poor prognostic signs and may pathogenetically predispose the patient to intraabdominal arteritis. Outcome can only be favorably altered by early recognition and prompt institution of appropriate medical and/or surgical management.",
