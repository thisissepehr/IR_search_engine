Nevertheless, how the two compartments and conduits of this simple model map onto the vastly more complicated structure of an actual lung remain unclear. To investigate this issue, we developed a multiscale branching airway tree model of the respiratory system that predicts realistic input impedance spectra between 5 and 20 Hz with only four free parameters. We use this model to study how the finite elastances of the conducting airway tree and the proximal upper airways affect impedance between 5 and 20 Hz. We show that progressive constriction of the peripheral airways causes impedance to appear to arise from two compartments connected in series, with the proximal compartment being a reflection of the elastance of upper airway structures proximal to the tracheal entrance and the lower compartment reflecting the pulmonary airways and tissues. We thus conclude that while this simple inverse model allows evaluation of overall respiratory system impedance between 5 and 20 Hz in the presence of upper airway shunting, it does not allow the separate contributions of central versus peripheral pulmonary airways to be resolved.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The measurement of respiratory impedance by oscillometry presents the opportunity to link structure to function in terms of simple inverse models of the respiratory system [1, 2] . Such models typically consist of a very small number of compartments characterized by only a few free parameters. Once the parameters of an inverse model are evaluated by fitting the model to measurements of respiratory system impedance, they are taken to represent quantities of physiologic interest such as the flow resistance of the airways and the viscoelastic properties of the tissues. However, the extremely coarse-grained view of the lung afforded by simple inverse models contrasts starkly with the complexities of a real lung, and even with the tens of thousands of individually resolved voxels obtainable by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging [3, 4] . The reason why simple models often accurately account for data arising from highly complicated structures such as a lung is that the contributions of the myriad components of the complicated structure can compensate for each other. This makes the system appear much simpler than it actually is, particularly if the operating ranges of frequency and amplitude are limited.

The structure of the airway tree in the model follows the Horsfield branching scheme [7, 8] in which airway branches are numbered starting from the lung periphery.

We are concerned here with those conducting airway branches that contribute to the overall resistance of the airways. The very peripheral bronchioles are small and thus individually have high resistances. At the same time, however, they are so numerous that their combined cross section is very large, leading them to comprise what has been called the \"silent zone\" of the lung [9] , although one could imagine that the boundary of this zone moves distally as airways become more constricted or eliminated in disease.

However, the conventional unit of pressure in respiratory mechanics is the centimeter of water (cmH 2 O), which is the pressure exerted over an area of 1 cm 2 by a water column 1 cm in height. This column has a volume of 1 ml, a mass of 1 g, and therefore a weight of 1 g experiencing the acceleration due to gravity (roughly 1000 cm s \u00c02 ). A pressure of 1 cmH 2 O is thus equivalent to a force of 1000 g cm s \u00c02 acting over an area of 1 cm \u00c02 , or 1000 g s \u00c02 cm \u00c01 . To convert a value of resistance in units of g s \u00c01 cm \u00c04 to one expressed in conventional units, the value is divided by 1000 to give units of (g s \u00c02 cm \u00c01 ) (s 2 cm 1 ) s \u00c01 cm \u00c04 \u00bc cmH 2 O s ml \u00c01 .

Using an anatomically reasonable value for R N of 0.75 cm, we found that c \u00bc 0:86 gave a value for overall resistance of the airway tree resistance (R aw ) of 0.62 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , which is similar to values found experimentally [20] . We used a value for H rs of 30 cmH 2 O L \u00c01 as representative of a normal adult lung. When the airways are completely rigid, and with the shunt effect of the upper airways excluded, the real part of Z shows a slight dependence on f resulting from the frequency dependence of the tissue impedance inherent in its constant-phase formulation (Eqs. (13) and (14)) and from the regional ventilation heterogeneity resulting from the asymmetrical airway branching pattern inherent in D \u00bc 3. The imaginary part of Z increases monotonically with f , achieving a resonant frequency around 7 Hz, which is similar to that typically observed in normal adults [2] . When the finite elastance of the airways due to the compressibility of the gas they contain (E a in Eqs. (6) and (7)) is included in the calculation, the effects on both real and imaginary parts of Z are imperceptible ( Fig. 5(a) ). To include the effects of intrinsic wall tissue stiffness (E b in Eqs. (8) and (9)), we chose a value for E tis of 30 cmH 2 O since this produced an overall airway tree elastance due to tissue distension of 550 cmH 2 O L \u00c01 which is close to the value used by Mead [14] . This has a more noticeable effect on impedance, particularly resistance, as does the inclusion of upper airway shunting ( Fig. 5(a) ). None of the effects of airway elastance on the impedance of the normal respiratory system could be described as dramatic, however. Figure 5 (b) shows corresponding plots when R aw is increased approximately fivefold to 2.09 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , achieved in this case Fig. 2 Electrical analog of the impedance,Z k , subtended by an airway of order k. The airway flow resistance (R k ) and gas inertance (I k ) are connected in series, and their sum is itself in series with the parallel combination of the two downstream daughter impedances Z k 21 and Z k 212D . The result is then connected in parallel with the elastance (E k ) of the parent airway. by decreasing r N from 0.75 to 0.50 cm while retaining all other model parameters unchanged. This represents a moderate level of bronchoconstriction that is uniform throughout the airway tree (all airways narrow by the same fractional amount). The relative effects of airway elastance and upper airway shunting are similar to those under conditions shown in Fig. 5(a) . This contrasts with the consequences of preferentially narrowing the more distal airways by keeping r N fixed at its baseline value of 0.75 cm while reducing c from 0.86 to 0.84, thereby making the airways narrow more rapidly with decreasing order number for an increase in R aw of about fivefold to a value of 2.33 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 . The addition of airway elastance and upper airway shunting has little consequence for resistance but causes a major effect on resonant frequency (Fig. 5(c) ). Finally, Fig. 5(d) shows what happens when obstruction is replaced by restriction achieved by increasing H rs from 30 to 100 cmH 2 O L \u00c01 , corresponding to a loss of roughly 2/3 of the parenchymal tissues.

We were able to simulate a R aw of this nature ( Fig. 6(a) ) by setting c \u00bc 0:82 while keeping the other parameters the same as those used to generate the baseline data in Fig. 5 (a) (short-dashed line). Also shown in Fig. 6(a) is the excellent fit provided by the two-compartment inverse model (Eqs. (19)- (21) ) that yields the parameter values R c \u00bc 0:33 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , E c \u00bc 522 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , I c \u00bc 0:0001 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , R p \u00bc 9:97 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , and E p \u00bc 51 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 . The value of R aw in the simulation model was 10.11 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , while the total airway elastance was 762 cmH 2 O L \u00c01 . A similar degree of overall airway constriction ( Fig. 6(b) ) was achieved by setting R N \u00bc 0:35 (i.e., narrowing all airways by the same relative amount) while keeping the other parameters the same as those used to generate the short-dashed line in Fig. 5(a) . However, the fit of the two-compartment inverse model in this case, as shown in Fig. 6(b) , is not nearly as good as the fit in Fig. 6(a) . The parameter values of the fit in Fig. 6(b) are R c \u00bc 4:70 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , E c \u00bc 1094 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , I c \u00bc 0:0000 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , R p \u00bc 2:35 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , and E p \u00bc 43 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 , while the value of R aw in the simulation model was 6.02 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 and the total airway elastance was 5254 cmH 2 O L \u00c01 . Figure 7 shows how the best-fit parameters of the inverse model vary when the model is fit to simulated data corresponding to progressive degrees of peripheral airway constriction from the baseline condition of c \u00bc 0:86 to the highly constricted condition of c \u00bc 0:80. This addresses the extent to which the parameters of the inverse model correspond to components of the anatomically based simulation model. In the case of peripheral airway resistance, this correspondence is extremely good; R p estimates the overall resistance of the airway tree in the forward model closely (Fig. 7(a) ). The correspondence is less clear for the elastance of the peripheral compartment (E p ), which is about 50% higher than the total tissue elastance in the forward model over most of the c range investigated (Fig. 7(b) ). The elastance of the central compartment (E c ), in contrast, is considerably lower than that of the upper airway shunt compartment in the forward model, with the exception of c \u00bc 0:85 (Fig. 7(c) ). These results indicate that the two-compartment inverse model captures the global compartmentalization of the respiratory system by parsing it into a proximal shunt compartment and a distal respiratory system compartment. Nevertheless, the two compartments of the inverse model cannot be taken as accurate representations of either the upper airways or the respiratory system itself even though the parameter R p appears to accurately reflect the overall resistance of the pulmonary airway tree.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 538, "end": 542, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 280, "end": 289, "text": "Fig. 6(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 403, "end": 409, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 449, "end": 458, "text": "Fig. 6(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 896, "end": 905, "text": "Fig. 6(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1105, "text": "Fig. 5(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1197, "text": "Fig. 6(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1245, "text": "Fig. 6(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1292, "text": "Fig. 6(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1576, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2156, "text": "(Fig. 7(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2376, "text": "(Fig. 7(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2575, "text": "(Fig. 7(c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "Anatomically based lung models tailored to the airway tree characteristics of individual patients based on three-dimensional imaging data have been used to study respiratory impedance previously [12, 21, 22] .

Also, while simulation of impedance using a patient-specific model has obvious potential for aiding in the design of treatment strategies for a given patient, the results lack generality. In this study, we sought to use an anatomically based model with a minimum number of free parameters in order to obtain insights that are as general as possible. Fortunately, a high degree of parsimony is possible in the modeling of respiratory impedance because the airway tree is a fairly regular multiscale structure that can be represented in an average sense as a fractal [10, 23] , meaning it can be modeled reasonably accurately using only a very few scaling parameters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 195, "end": 199, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 200, "end": 203, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 204, "end": 207, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 899, "end": 903, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 904, "end": 907, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Simple inverse models of the lung have also found wide application in the study of lung mechanics and have been applied to respiratory impedance data over a number of different frequency ranges [1] . We focus here on the intermediate frequency range of 5-20 Hz since this has received a great deal of clinical interest. Indeed, resistances at 5 and 20 Hz and the area under the reactance curve below the resonant frequency are commonly used empirical markers of lung function [24, 25] . Understanding what these quantities reflect anatomically is therefore very useful for linking structure to function. The results of the present computational modeling study indicate that the finite elasticity of the airway tree and the shunt elastance of the upper airways can significantly affect respiratory system impedance between 5 and 20 Hz when the airways become constricted (Fig. 5) , particularly in the case of upper airway shunt. Severe peripheral airway constriction leads to the type of negative dependence of resistance on frequency ( Fig.  6 (a)) that has been described in obese subjects, although at the same time this condition pushes the resonant frequency to values higher than observed by Al-Alwan et al. [5] . The twocompartment inverse model shown in Fig. 4 describes Z under these conditions very accurately (Fig. 6(a) ), returning parameter values reminiscent of those found in obese subjects [5] . On the other hand, when the airways constrict by the same fractional degree throughout the airway tree the two-compartment inverse model does not describe Z well (Fig. 6(b) ). This shows that the compartmentalization of the respiratory system, at least to the extent that it behaves like two elastic compartments connected in series, depends to a substantial degree on the pattern of airway narrowing. Of course, the lungs can also become compartmentalized in a parallel fashion as first examined by Otis et al. [26] , and indeed regional ventilation defects are well known to occur in asthma [27] . It is likely, however, that the time constants involved in such defects are quite long relative to those of normal lung emptying, which would suggest that a parallel two-compartment model of the lung would be more appropriate for a range of frequencies much lower than those we consider here.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 197, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 476, "end": 480, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 481, "end": 484, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1217, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1409, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1924, "end": 1928, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2009, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 870, "end": 878, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1044, "text": "Fig.  6", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1268, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1330, "text": "(Fig. 6(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1584, "text": "(Fig. 6(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The best-fit values of the parameters of the inverse model show that while its two compartments are largely reflective, respectively, of the proximal upper airways and the elastic structures distal to the tracheal opening, they nevertheless do not correspond precisely to these structures (Figs. 7(b) and 7(c)). With predominately peripheral airway constriction, the parameter R p appears to provide an accurate reflection of R aw in the simulation model ( Fig. 7(a) ), yet when fractional narrowing is uniform throughout the airway tree R p is less than half of R aw . This implies that it is effectively impossible to reliably attribute the parameters of the inverse model to central versus peripheral airways as is commonly supposed [25] , and that the apparent two-compartment nature of Z between 5 and 20 Hz in spontaneously breathing humans is due to the interaction of upper airway shunting and the overall impedance of the respiratory system.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 736, "end": 740, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 457, "end": 466, "text": "Fig. 7(a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results of our study suggest that eliminating the compliance of the upper airways would greatly improve the ability of oscillometry to probe lung function in obstructive disease.

This approach is too cumbersome for routine use, however, leaving little choice but to use conventional cheek support with the hands. On the other hand, our findings underscore the need to support the cheeks as firmly as possible. They also demonstrate why oscillometry is so naturally suited to the study of intubated patients receiving mechanical ventilation and to the study of tracheostomized animal models [2] , since in both cases the upper airways are bypassed altogether, allowing an unfettered mechanical view into the lungs from the tracheal opening.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 350, "end": 354, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The conclusions of our study rest, of course, on the extent to which our computational model of respiratory system impedance approximates reality. This model arguably accounts for the key global features of pulmonary anatomy that include an asymmetrically branching airway tree comprised of successively smaller branches that terminate in parenchyma having a complex mechanical impedance. Nevertheless, the model ignores structural subtleties that are unique to individual lungs, and it assumes a level of scale-free symmetry that is an oversimplification of real airway tree structure. Also, in this study, we simulated bronchoconstriction either by narrowing all airways by the same proportional amount (Figs. 5(b) and 6(a)) or by altering a single scaling parameter so that airways narrow proportionately more according to how peripheral they are (Figs. 5(c) and 6(b)). In reality, narrowing is likely to be heterogeneous throughout the airway tree [4, 21, 27] . Indeed, such regional heterogeneity may be responsible for some of the negative frequency dependence of resistance observed in obese subjects [5] . The difficulty with trying to explain impedance in these terms, however, is that there is an essentially limitless number of possible heterogeneous configurations of the airway tree that could potentially explain a given impedance spectrum, even when guided by high-resolution three-dimensional imaging [4, 12, 21, 22] . This is why we opted in this study to try to reproduce the essential features of impedance with a scale-free model characterized by as few free parameters as possible.

An alternative approach for estimating E tis is to consider how R aw depends on transpulmonary pressure. For example, Brown et al. [20] obtained a slope of 0.71 L s \u00c01 cmH 2 O \u00c02 for the relationship between respiratory system conductance and transpulmonary pressure in healthy adult subjects when conductance itself was around 1 L s \u00c01 cmH 2 O \u00c01 . Assume this corresponds roughly to a slope of R aw versus transpulmonary pressure of about 1 s L \u00c01 when R aw \u00bc 1 cmH 2 O s L \u00c01 at a pressure of 1 cmH 2 O. Further assume that changes in R aw occur solely through changes in airway radius. A doubling of transpulmonary pressure from 1 to 2 cmH 2 O is predicted to increase radius by the fourth root of 2 (via Eq. (4)), or a factor of roughly 1.2, corresponding to a fractional change in airway volume of about 1.4. If the total volume of the airway tree is 100 ml, this means that the airways expand by 40 ml with a 1 cmH 2 O increase in transmural pressure, giving an airway tree elastance of 1/0.04 \u00bc 24 cmH 2 O L \u00c01 . This is an order of magnitude lower than the value of 500 cmH 2 O L \u00c01 we used in this present study, meaning that E tis would be correspondingly reduced. While this would produce much greater effects on impedance that those shown in Fig. 5 , it is probably unrealistic because changing lung volume slowly over the vital capacity range, as in Ref. [20] , would likely alter airway smooth muscle tone and thus produce significantly greater changes in airway caliber than would be caused by small-amplitude forced oscillations in flow.
