Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach in which therapeutic nucleic acids are transferred into the affected organs. Although the ideal concept would be the replacement of the abnormal gene by a copy of the functional gene, currently there have not been reliable and safe techniques to allow the site-specific integration of DNA into the human genome (2). Thus, almost all gene therapies are developed by simply transferring the therapeutic gene into somatic cells without replacing the abnormal gene. The goal is to identify and correct genetic abnormalities interfering with the cell cycle and to correct them in all cells. Technically, there are two methods amenable for gene transfer: reintroduction of in vitro transferred gene into the body and direct transfer of gene into the target cells in vivo.",

Genes involved in carcinogenesis are often usefully categorized as either oncogenes contributing to the development of cancer or tumor suppressor genes suppressing the development and maintenance of the cancer phenotype. Therefore, gene therapy is developed by targeting these two genes. Current strategies undergoing development for gene therapy involve in restoring tumor suppressor gene function, downregulating oncogeneic expression, stimulating immune response, introducing genes that either increase drug sensitivity or confer multidrug resistance, and modulating tumor angiogenesis genetically (4-13). In this chapter, principles and methods of suicide gene therapy are reviewed together with the results of its clinical trials. Protocols required for application of human study are discussed in details by using Ad-TK gene therapy for liver tumors as an example.",

These suicide genes are not present in human cells, so an elective delivery of these genes into cancer cells followed by the administration of a prodrug can lead to a conversion of the drug into cytotoxic substances in the transduced cells. The delivery and transcription of a tumor-specific suicide gene in vivo are crucial for suicide gene therapy to be effective. Currently, two strategies are being investigated to selectively transduce tumor cells: tumor-specific vectors and control of suicide gene transcription in tissues or tumors with a tumor-specific promoter. Promoters such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), or \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) for liver tumors, limit gene expression to CEA-or AFP-positive cells only. The most commonly used suicide genes are cytosine deaminase (CD) and the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK).",

Under the control of an AFP promoter, an adenoviral vector was used to bring the HSV-TK gene into various HCC cell lines (5). Following ganciclovir (GCV) administration, cell death occurred in hepatoma cells producing AFP, leaving non-AFP-producing cell lines unaffected. Phosphorylated GCV is thought to cause cell death by the inhibition of DNA polymerase and by causing chain termination during DNA synthesis in dividing cells, which then leads to apoptosis (16). A bystander effect has been described, both in vitro and in vivo, where neighboring HSV-TK-negative cells have died when in contact with HSV-TK-positive cells after GCV treatment (17). This increases the effectiveness of suicide gene therapy, and only a part of a tumor mass needs to be transfected by a suicide gene for tumor destruction. A glucocorticoidresponsive element exists upstream of the AFP gene in hepatoma cells, which explains the increase in AFP observed after the addition of dexamethasone into the culture medium of such cells (18). It is possible that the potency of the TK/GCV suicide system could be enhanced by the addition of dexamethasone to a HepG2 cell line (19) .",

The retrovirus has been further improved so that the HSV-TK gene expression is under the control of a human AFP enhancer directly linked to its promoter [LNAF0.3(E+)TK]. The vector also sensitized both low-and intermediate-AFP-producing hepatoma cells to GCV treatment, and did not affect cell growth in nonhepatoma cells (20) . In animal models, GCV treatment has led to more pronounced growth inhibition in the LNAF0.3(E+)TK infected cells than in the LNAF0.3TK infected cells (20) .

The bystander effect enabled tumor regression even when only 10% of the tumor mass expressed HSV-TK (17). A similar therapeutic response has been seen in rats with colorectal liver metastases, where following direct intratumoral injections of HSV-TK-producing packaging cells, a 60-fold reduction in tumor mass was noted following GCV treatment when compared with controls (21). Kuriyama et al. described cancer gene therapy with the GCV-HSV-TK system that induced efficient antitumor effects and protective immunity in immunocompetent mice, but not in nude mice. This indicates that a T-cell-mediated immune response may be a critical factor for HSV-TK gene therapy to be successful (22) .",

A bystander effect occurred irrespective of cell-tocell contact with transduced cells. On cell lysis, 5-FU is released into the medium and is thus likely to be responsible for the bystander effect, and, indeed, the 5-FU levels in the medium correlated well with the degree of cytotoxicity (24). AFP-positive HCC tumors that have been established subcutaneously in vivo have been shown to regress significantly after adenoviral-mediated insertion of the CD gene (with an AFP promoter) and subsequent 5-FC administration, and in one study, nontumor tissue was unaffected (6). Block Sung et al. have recently published the result of a phase I clinical trial using intratumoral injection of escalating doses of adenovirus-mediated suicide gene followed by intravenous GCV at a fixed dose in patients with colorectal liver metastases (13). The aim was to assess the safety and maximal tolerated dosage of Adv.RSV-TK. The vector was infected into a metastatic tumor in the liver under local anaethesia and ultrasound guidance. A total of 16 patients were entered into the trial who received five dose-level cohorts of Adv.RSV-TK, from 1.0 \u00d7 10 10 to 1.0 \u00d7 10 13 virus particles per patient. The response rate was assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria with follow-up imaging studies. The assessment of toxicity was carried out according to Common Toxicity Criteria v. 2.0 from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). One patient was withdrawn from the study because of clinical deterioration from disease and died. Stable disease (defined as < 25% change in the size of the tumor measured on computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) was seen in 11 patients. One patient had a biopsy of the injected tumor at 11 wk following treatment that revealed extensive necrosis of the tumor on histology, whereas five others had a biopsy taken at the later date but showed no evidence of necrosis. Adv.RSV-TK DNA was not detected in any of these six biopsed specimen. Low transient toxicities were present in patients including grade 1 elevations in serum aminotransferase in three patients, grade 2-3 fevers in five patients, grade 3 thrombocytopenia in one patient, and grade 2 leucopenia in three patients. One patient is alive at 40.5 mo, but the remaining 15 died between 0.2 and 36.5 mo (median: 11.3 mo). The authors concluded that adv.RSV-TK could be safely administered by percutaneous intratumoral injection in patients with hepatic metastases at doses up to 1.0 \u00d7 10 13 virus particles per patient and could provide the basis for future clinical trials. However, the trial did not demonstrate any tumor reponse following intratumoural injection of adv.RSV-TK.",

After viral internalization, intracellular adenoviral replication augments an administered dose to the level required to kill the tumor host cells only, leaving neighboring normal tissues intact. dl1520 is an adenovirus hybrid of serotypes 2 and 5 with a genome deletion in the E1B region, causing loss of expression of viral 55-kDa protein (E1B 55K). E1B 55K has been shown to bind to the mammalian tumor cell suppressor protein p53 and block p53-mediated transcriptional activation (32). p53 has many functions including arrest of the G 1 phase of cell proliferation via the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF1/Cip1, or apoptosis through induction of genes such as bax (33) . Studies have shown that dl1520 appears to replicate independently of p53 status in many tumor cell lines (33-36) .",

Habib et al. (11) have reported the results of a phase I and a phase II clinical study, in which patients with primary and secondary liver tumors were treated with E1B 55-kDa deleted dl1520. The adenovirus was given via three different routes: intratumoral, intra-arterial, and intravenous. The study has confirmed that dl1520 was well tolerated when given as either monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, ultrastructural examination of tissue showed the presence of adenovirus in cell cytoplasm around the nucleus and revealed two dissimilar end points of cell death after virus infection: a preapoptotic sequence and necrosis (11). Reid et al. have recently published their results of a phase I study in patients with colorectal liver metastases by using intra-arterial administration of a replication-selective adenovirus (dl1520) (38) . In this study, dl1520 was infused into the hepatic artery at doses of 2 \u00d7 10 8 to 2 \u00d7 10 12 particles for two cycles (d 1 and 8) with subsequent cycles of dl1520 administered in combination with intravenous 5-FU and leucovorin. They have successfully demonstrated intravascular administration of dl1520 virus and have shown that hepatic artery infusion of the attenuated adenovirus dl1520 was well tolerated at doses resulting in infection, replication, and chemotherapy-associated antitumoral activity.",

Injection of Ad.CMV-CD into the tail vein of tumor-bearing mice resulted in delayed tumor growth with a significant reduction in hepatic metastases. Gnant et al. (8) pub-lished results with a recombinant TK-deleted vaccinia virus encoding CD, where tumor-bearing mice were treated with this recombinant vaccinia virus and 5-FC. It was found that tumor-specific gene delivery was achieved irrespective of the administration route, with gene expression in tumors increasing by up to 100,000-fold when compared with normal tissues. Treatment using a CD-expressing virus and systemic 5-FC resulted in significant survival benefit in all treatment groups when compared with controls (8).",
