Specialized immune cells, referred to as 'TIE2-expressing monocytes and macrophages' (TEM), were shown to specifically respond to ANG2 binding. However, their involvement in acute inflammatory processes is so far completely undescribed. Thus, our aim was to assess the dynamics of TEMs in a murine model of ALI. Results: Intratracheal instillation of LPS induced a robust pulmonary pro-inflammatory response with endothelial barrier dysfunction and significantly enhanced ANG2 expression. The percentage number of TEMs, assessed by FACS analysis, was more than trebled compared to controls, with TEM count in lungs reaching more than 40% of all macrophages. Such distinct dynamic was absent in all other analyzed compartments (alveolar space, spleen, blood).

As inflammation results in the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which in turn upregulates ANG2, acute inflammatory conditions (e.g., in ALI) induce ANG2 overexpression [7, 25, 26] . We used tracheal LPS instillation to induce ALI in mice. ECs do not react to direct TLR4 stimulation with upregulation of ANG2 gene expression or release [27] . However, thrombin may be extensively generated in lungs in response to intratracheal LPS administration [28] . It promotes rapid ANG2 release from ECs and, furthermore, activates protein kinase C (PKC), thereby inducing loss of endothelial barrier integrity in various ways [29] [30] [31] . Histamine, another known strong inductor of ANG2 release, is also generated in large amounts during LPS-induced ALI [32] . In our experiments, thrombin, histamine as well as PKC activation by PMA resulted in increased ANG2 release from ECs and subsequent upregulation of its expression. In vivo, mice that were challenged with LPS rapidly developed signs of ALI such as significant pulmonary vascular leakage, neutrophil infiltration and intraalveolar migration, as well as extensive upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lung ANG2 tissue protein content declined under ALI conditions, reflecting release from cellular storage vesicles into the blood vessel system. The depletion of the intracellular ANG2 pool constitutes an adequate stimulus for the endothelial cell to upregulate ANG2 expression, which was evidenced in ALI animals in comparison to the controls [30] . Although not been demonstrated for LPS-induced direct ALI so far, lung ANG2 upregulation has been reported in models of indirect (remote) ALI [33, 34] . Overall lung TIE2 expression was significantly reduced under ALI conditions in our experiments. This agrees with the recent literature and is, together with increased ANG2 activity, considered to contribute to pulmonary vascular leakage in ALI [7, 35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 72, "end": 75, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 263, "end": 266, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 267, "end": 270, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 271, "end": 274, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 431, "end": 435, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 542, "end": 546, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 712, "end": 716, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 717, "end": 721, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 722, "end": 726, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 845, "end": 849, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1604, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1749, "end": 1753, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1757, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2004, "end": 2007, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2008, "end": 2011, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our experiments, induction of ALI induced significant increase in total monocyte count in peripheral blood. Due to low absolute TEM frequencies in blood, their count was not significantly altered. Simultaneous decline of monocytes in spleen suggests recruitment of pooled cells into systemic circulation [36] . In lungs of LPS-challenged mice, during early stage of ALI, number of MPh in interstitium was significantly decreased compared to healthy controls, most obviously due to pulmonary infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes, reducing percentage MPh count. During murine ALI, neutrophil infiltration occurs and peaks early, followed by a delayed, though sustained MPh immigration [37] . This was reflected by increasing MPh count in the further course of ALI in our experiments, while that of neutrophil granulocytes began to fall after 72 h. While in spleen and BALF, the dynamic behavior of the TIE2-positive cell fraction mainly reflects that of the total count of monocytes or macrophages, respectively, FACS analysis of TIE2-expressing macrophages in lung interstitium surprisingly revealed a dynamic different from that of TIE2-negative cells. Early after ALI induction, while count of TIE2-negative MPh decreased, that of TEMs in lung tissue significantly increased. This resulted in percentage TEM numbers being more than three times higher than in lungs of healthy control animals (> 40% of counted MPh), suggesting significant pulmonary TEM infiltration. Of note, TEM numbers in the lungs were the highest, compared to all other analyzed compartments. During the further course, percentage TEM numbers then were significantly reduced compared to early ALI, reaching the level of control mice. Intralesional increase of TEM count is well described, predominantly in solid malignancies, but although specific chemoattraction by ANG2 has been demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo, the detailed contribution of TEMs from compartments outside a tumor (spleen, peripheral blood) is still uncertain [22, 38] . Venneri et al. could not assess significant differences in TEM frequencies when analyzing peripheral blood samples from healthy donors and cancer patients, and if they may correlate with tumor burden is yet unclear [22, 39, 40] . Our data revealed that the specific dynamic of pulmonary TEMs in ALI was absent in the other analyzed compartments: while the ratio between TIE2-positive and -negative macrophages in lung interstitium was significantly elevated in early stage of ALI and fell to the level of controls during the further course, that ratio between TEM and TIE2-negative monocytes was unaffected in peripheral blood or in the spleen as well, the pool where monocytes are supposed to be recruited from during acute inflammation [36] . This suggests that lung-resident MPh may change their surface characteristics under conditions of ALI rather than the immigration of TEMs from extrapulmonary compartments into the site of inflammation. However, it is a critical limitation of our study that this hypothesis is solely supported by the results from our in vitro experiments. When we incubated human monocytic THP-1 cells with LPS or recombinant TNF-\u03b1 to assess TIE2 regulation under pro-inflammatory conditions, this elicited a dose-dependent increase in the gene expression of TIE2. That finding may be in line with the results from Garc\u00eda et al., who demonstrated enhanced expression of TIE2 in pro-inflammatory polarized macrophages [41] . If TLR activation or the secretion of cytokines in the lungs during ALI contribute to enhanced TIE2 expression in resident macrophages in vivo as well remains to be investigated. Moreover, pulmonary tissue hypoxia which may develop during ALI/ARDS can have an additional impact on leukocyte TIE2 expression [24, 42] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 311, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 689, "end": 693, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2015, "end": 2019, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2023, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2241, "end": 2245, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2249, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2250, "end": 2253, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2768, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3471, "end": 3475, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3785, "end": 3789, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3790, "end": 3793, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "So far, involvement of TEMs has primarily been described in cancerous diseases, either in solid tumor growth or in leukemia [10, 43] . In addition, their occurence was demonstrated under conditions of chronic inflammation such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, or autoimmune disease, in limb ischemia, endometriosis, and in chronic virus hepatitis [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . However, although Murdoch et al. already speculated that TEMs are \"likely to be actively recruited to inflamed [\u2026] tissues\", our study is the first to describe dynamics of TEMs in a condition of acute inflammation like ALI [24] . But what would be the pathophysiologic significance of acutely increased TEM activity in lung injury or ARDS? Enhanced expression of MMP-9 and VEGF by TEMs could contribute to loss of endothelial barrier function and thus vascular leakage during ALI [12] . However, in our experiments, TEM increase in lungs did not correlate with expression of MMP-9 or VEGF, and, even though increased, due to their relatively low absolute number, a direct effect on vascular leakage seems unlikely. Few authors report on pro-inflammatory properties of ANG2-activated TEMs [41, 47] . However, most likely, they play an immunoregulating role. Besides their pro-angiogenic potential, TEMs possess distinct immunomodulating features. Upon immigration, the stimulation by their specific ligand ANG2 upregulates the expression of IL-10, MRC1 (mannose receptor 1), and CCL17, while that of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, CCL2) is reduced, which is indicative of an alternative, M2-like activation of macrophages [12, 24] . Furthermore, in solid tumors, ANG2-activated TEMs were shown to promote the expansion of regulatory T cells, thus supporting further tumor growth [51] . In fact, recruitment of M2-polarized macrophages into the lungs occurs early during ALI (within 24 h) and is supposed to serve to balance the pro-inflammatory response [37] . Moreover, early, compared to late appearance of IL-10-producing cells in human ALI was shown to influence prognosis [52] .
