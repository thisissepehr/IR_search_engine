At present a small number of fatalities have occurred by infection from chickens to humans and rare human to human transfer (4) . If a form allowing ready infection of humans were to occur, according to WHO the virus has the potential to infect at least 20% of the global population. Efforts are being made to develop a conventional virus-based vaccine, but the production process is relatively slow and the number of specialist producers small (5) . The expectation from past pandemics is that global spread would occur in 6 months (6) . This is approximately the period required for vaccine production in hen eggs under favorable conditions together with the brief clinical studies that are required in Europe (7) . World capacity for influenza vaccine has been 900 million units of a monovalent vaccine (1) . Some 65% of this is produced in Europe. It will be difficult for countries without capacity to put virus-based vaccine production in place just for a possible pandemic, and increased production will probably occur slowly as wider general vaccination for inter-pandemic periods develops. The 900 million doses will be reduced if more than one injection of the normal amount is required or if the need for protection against new human strains such as the California H3N2 type becomes pressing. In addition a candidate virus-based vaccine prepared in 2003 was not usable because by 2004 antigenic differences had occurred (8) so that applicability of stocks remains uncertain. Potential drugs are available but on an even smaller scale and of variable effectiveness against different strains. Against this background a DNA vaccine is of global interest since in principle it might be possible to produce this on many more industrial sites.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 159, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 221, "end": 224, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 225, "end": 227, "text": "3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 354, "end": 357, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 675, "end": 678, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 763, "end": 766, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 942, "end": 945, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1039, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1664, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "At present there is no commercial influenza DNA vaccine, though human trials for this virus have been successful at Phase 1 (9) .

In normal circumstances it would take a number of years for a novel form of a vaccine to progress to a point where it would be applied to a human population. However, accelerated human trials could be contemplated if heavy fatalities from a virulent strain threatened and the pandemic showed the potential for continuing to outrun conventional vaccine supply. There would be major medical, social, regulatory and political issues raised, but equally critical would be the supply of DNA vaccine on the kilogram scale necessary.

Probably only one or two currently have the capacity to produce quantities that could address whole populations. Experience of the 1976 swine flu potential pandemic in the U.S. (17) suggests that it would be extremely difficult for any government to supply flu vaccine to others in a pandemic before its own nationals were fully covered. Similarly it may be possible to license strains, patents, and know-how, but given the relevance of these to other commercial vaccine targets, that will require more negotiation than seems likely to occur until a pressing emergency exists. The purpose of this paper is to address the process issues that would be faced outside the small group of current companies producing plasmid DNA for trials and to identify the most relevant literature so that the technical challenges are discussed. The publications and patents cited give a great deal more detail than can be summarized here and would be an essential basis for any process planning. Because there are significant gaps in the published knowledge the present paper also either provides a foundation for making choices or defines the gaps. Finally, because there are so few companies with capacities for large scale manufacture specifically for DNA vaccine and potentially no time to build tailored capacity, it has been necessary to identify existing types of facilities that might be switched. Neither of the most likely, biopharmaceutical protein or nonpenicillin antibiotics plants, are ideal, but both could in principle be applied. Most biopharmaceutical plants are located in the U.S. and Europe. The great majority are for recombinant protein production rather than plasmid DNA. In that situation the front end fermentation and recovery systems will be partly applicable, though the oxygen and heat transfer capacity may not always be geared to the usual E. coli source of plasmid DNA. The purification stages of current biopharmaceutical facilities are heavily chromatographic. but because of the relatively much larger size of plasmid DNA. the capacity of columns will not match the need. It also is possible in principle that some of the mammalian cell facilities for protein production could be utilized for virus-based vaccines. This option will not be considered further here, though such a vaccine would be the first choice because it is closer to existing safe products. The technology is even more demanding than that for DNA vaccines and so harder to transfer.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 342, "end": 346, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Beyond biopharmaceutical facilities the main pharmaceutical capacity globally will be for antibiotics, and here fermenters of 100 m 3 will be common. The relevant downstream processing will be dominated by liquidliquid extractors, resin-based ion exchange, and hydrophobic sorption-desorption. In addition it is regulatory practice that penicillin production facilities are not used for other products because of the concern for cross contamination and the impact on penicillin-allergic patients. The numbers actually testing allergic are much smaller than patient numbers reporting it (18) , but at 0.015-0.04% cases of anaphylaxis the 150,000-400,000 per 100 million becomes very significant with potential pandemic vaccination. Other antibiotics pose a lesser problem but it remains an issue (19) , and plant revalidation would be required as indeed it would formally in other facilities.

These are addressed in the discussion. Finally the uptake of the vaccine by the population will be hard to predict and will be likely to depend on the risk perceived by individuals of the pandemic virus versus a previously unused vaccine type. For this reason the paper comments on issues at both 10 and 100 m 3 fermentation scales. The 100 m 3 scale is principally relevant to antibiotics facilities, but these would be the only ones available on some continents. They could also potentially process large amounts quickly. To be of value the facilities to be used would need to be operating in the pharmaceutical sector and with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Equally only staff experienced in all issues of producing pharmaceutical products could address the challenge, and even then it would be difficult unless there was detailed input from those experienced in commercial plasmid processing.

The main alternative process routes to extraction are also summarized. Two methods with many variants have been used to prepare plasmid DNA in the laboratory. In the first, lysozyme is used to prepare a spheroplast from E. coli, which is then lysed by brief heating to near boiling point in the presence of a detergent, usually Triton X-100 (29) . A second major route utilizes sodium hydroxide and the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for lysis (30) . The resulting material is neutralized by potassium acetate, which leads to a flocculant precipitate. By choosing the correct pH or equivalent sodium hydroxide concentration the chromosomal DNA together with protein are irreversibly denatured while neutralization recovers the plasmid largely in its desirable supercoiled form. The clarified liquor from the suspension represents the feedstock for further purification. The process in the laboratory is performed with cells from fermentation that have been harvested and resuspended typically at a concentration of 125 g/L wet weight. Following these two alternative methods of cell lysis a variety of laboratory methods are used to produce pure plasmid DNA. Classical methods involved 2-propanol precipitation, cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, and n-butanol or phenol extraction. These are not susceptible to scale-up.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 570, "end": 574, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 681, "end": 685, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Laboratory Procedures, Methods of Analysis, and Properties of Plasmid DNA"}, {"text": "The methods of analysis of plasmid DNA and its contaminants have been addressed recently (20, (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . The form of the plasmid required is the covalently closed supercoiled one and the contaminants include the molecule nicked on one strand (open circle forms) or on both strands at or near the same junction (linear forms). To give some idea of the size, a linear plasmid of 3000 base pairs (3 kb) has a molecular weight of 2 \u00d7 10 6 Da and a length of 1 \u00b5m. A supercoiled plasmid probably of 5-10 kb would be involved in a DNA vaccine for influenza. Such a plasmid would contain a pathogen-derived sequence, though it could, like the proposed H5N1 viralbased vaccine, be an altered sequence. Given that more than 50% of the cell solids are protein, more than 20% RNA, and that the plasmid DNA level will be 1-3%, the challenge of purification is large. The E. coli chromosomal DNA, which represents about 3% of the cell solids, is a contaminant with properties potentially close to those of the plasmid DNA. In addition, with a level of E. coli lipopolysaccharide of about 4%, reducing endotoxin from 10 7 EU/mL to less than 1 EU/mL will be demanding. The E. coli strain has a considerable bearing on the outcome, and ideally this will have been selected for high productivity. In a situation where large numbers of patients might eventually be treated, it will be especially crucial that potential DNA integration into human chromosomes be avoided. Therefore, as Prather and colleagues (25) noted, care should be taken in the choice of the insert and in avoiding homologous sequences between the human genome and the plasmid DNA. Promoters and terminator regions should also be carefully selected to restrict their biological activities on the sequences inserted in the plasmid.

When whole populations are the target, fermentation scales of 10 m 3 or above will mean that the downstream processing steps must have a good capacity and, as discussed below, operations such as chromatography and expanded bed adsorption become less attractive. In addition, at large scale and with a potentially simultaneous global demand, the consumables such as reagents and chromatographic media must be available commercially on a substantial scale. Preferably they should be produced by manufacturers in a number of countries because commandeering by some governments cannot be ruled out. Though cost will be less of an issue in a pandemic, simple processes and reagents are attractive because they facilitate rapid progress. All large scale purification routes to plasmid DNA ( Figure 1 ) are the subject of patents, so it will probably be sensible to choose the most attractive with respect to available plant. However, an early capacity to license know-how and patents in an uncertain prepandemic period when patent concerns apply could influence the choice. There are emerging technologies that could improve individual processing steps considerably, such as better centrifuge designs, superior chromatographic and expanded bed media, and alternative membranebased anion exchange adsorbents.

More detailed studies indicate that premature lysis is principally associated with cell discharge in the underflow stream. It is accompanied by additional intracellular damage as revealed by flow cytometry measurements (Gerard Chan et al., unpublished). In addition, holding cells at 13\u00b0C for 2-6 h reduced supercoiled content substantially and increased contamination due to premature cell membrane lysis.

If batch mixing intensity is increased, the precipitated chromosomal E. coli DNA is susceptible to shear damage. Several papers on the kinetics of the process have been published (61-63). Ciccolini and colleagues (63) indicated that a shear rate of about 460 s -1 with neutralization after 300 s was optimal in terms of maximum plasmid DNA release while avoiding excessive chromosomal DNA floc breakdown and maximum SDS precipitation of contaminants. The results were obtained in laminar flow shear fields. The neutralizing potassium acetate stream needs to be as cold as possible to insolubilize the contaminants, and at a m 3 scale this will demand significant chilling capacity. Recently the impact of lysis time, pH, and mixing has been examined (64) .

At large scales, batch mixing will involve increasingly difficult compromises. At pilot level these can to a degree be ameliorated by tailored mixer design (65, 66) . Where feasible they are desirable but at 1-10 m 3 scale and in a pandemic situation with existing plants being taken over, this would generally not be an option. However, elements of the ideal batch mixer may be feasible in individual facilities. First, the use of low power number impellors is desirable, and if possible several on the same shaft. Helical ribbon mixers are also an option and large marine impellors are reasonably effective. Individual impellor diameters should preferably be greater than half the vessel diameter. Second, there should be several feed points into well-mixed regions around the distal end of one or more impellors. A particular challenge of alkaline lysis is the sudden increase in viscosity and the formation of a sticky precipitate that can envelop the agitators. It is essential that agitators are not underpowered such that they are slowed by the high viscosity. Baffles will help but must stand free of the vessel sides to avoid dead zones. In the absence of specialist impellors, several separate mixers may be applied. Because higher pH strongly enhances shear-induced DNA degradation (67), it will be necessary to err on the side of stronger mixing to avoid such extremes. Ideal mixing would be continuous with a brief period of high shear followed by conditions of low shear, though as the scale increases even mixing in a continuous system will take longer. As recognized by Wan and colleagues (68), the full gains come with potassium acetate also added subsequently in continuous mode, but this increases the engineering complexity. A patent linked to that of Wan (69) described the small pilot continuous flow system. The continuous injection of the neutralized lysate into a batch collection vessel will agitate preformed floc with consequences for solid-liquid separation by flotation (see below). Companies do manufacture very large scale in-line mixers of the kind that would be needed to treat multi-m 3 volumes. However, the degree of engineering modification of existing plants is nontrivial. A similar result could be achieved by the setup shown in Figure 2 where existing pipelines and tanks are used. This also potentially allows the alkali and potassium acetate streams to be smaller and more concentrated. The degree of agitation in the two tanks must be adequate to avoid significant bypassing of fluid. We have explored the approach recently at pilot scale, and though there is still the need to manage the mixing on filling of the first tank, the system is workable. Most published procedures have a period of holding prior to neutralization of a few minutes, and this means interposing a holding line between the tanks.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 241, "end": 245, "text": "(65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 246, "end": 249, "text": "66)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2355, "end": 2363, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Cell Lysis"}, {"text": "Heat-Induced Lysis. In addition to the early literature (29) there is a patent (70) that described continuous heat treatment in a stainless steel tube maintained at 70-77\u00b0C followed after 30 min or less by cooling in the same tubular system. No visible clogging of the tube occurred. Industrial scale heat exchangers will be common in many plants, though the complexity of their internals may lead to a higher risk of blockage. One of the advantages of the method is that the volume of lysate is not increased. A disadvantage for some purification methods is that the chromosomal DNA produced is mostly in a double-stranded form. In addition the patent (70) noted that the yield of plasmid DNA was reduced by 4-5 times if lysozyme was omitted. It also seems to be the case that there is a 6-fold reduction in throughput because of a need for a longer holding time. In a pandemic situation the availability of recombinant lysozyme that was used would be an issue. Watson (71) noted that heat lysis represented 25% of the processing costs, with lysozyme accounting for the majority of the cost. The process needs to be controlled well because above a temperature of 93\u00b0C there is plasmid degradation and below 75\u00b0C the E. coli deoxyribonuclease that can degrade genomic DNA evidently is not fully denatured. The viscosity of the cell suspension, initially 1.94 cp (0.00195 Ns/m 2 ) at 24\u00b0C rose to 40 cp (0.040 Ns/m) on lysis. This procedure used Triton X-100 rather than the SDS employed with alkali. Kresheck and Altschuler (72) in filing a patent on an alternative detergent noted that Triton X-100 and SDS can degrade with time. A plate heat exchanger system of a relevant type is described in Higgins and colleagues (54) for treating mechanically disrupted E. coli to remove RNA. It was found necessary to use widely spaced plates and more of them to increase the heat transfer area so that hot water rather than steam could be used as the heating medium. A threestage arrangement was used in which heating to 55\u00b0C was achieved in two stages with a 30 s residence time, using in the first the previously heated process liquor (regeneration stage) and in the second, water at 65\u00b0C. After the regeneration stage further cooling was achieved with chilled water. The heating and cooling media were passed in cross-flow. Wang et al. (73) made a detailed study of the heating method without lysozyme and concluded that it was capable of a comparable yield to the alkali/SDS procedure.

Achieving harvest at 1-10 m 3 scale of a shear-sensitive floc of about 100 g/L wet weight is difficult.

Nienow et al. (2002) (66) indicated that this was followed by 5 \u00b5m filtration via a depth filter. A patent (75) described mixing 1200 g of diatomaceous earth with 13.5 L of neutralized lysate and filtering on precoated paper in 15 min. The 12 L recovered was a measure of the very large amount of body feed (88 g/L versus the more usual 15-30 g/L). It was also gravity-fed, whereas pressured feeds of 0.5 barg are normal (76, 77) . Precoat would typically be 1 kg/m 2 of filter area. When a total neutralized lysate suspension was filtered (78), the flux rates with a variety of filter cloths, meshes, and filter aids were relatively low if solids extrusion was to be avoided (average about 100 L/m 2 /h but ceasing in an hour) and filter blinding was observed with or without filter aid precoat. The process would be improved by body feed of filter aid and to a degree by rotary vacuum filtration with a high knife cutting rate, as observed (79) for cell debris. To meet biopharmaceutical cGMP, a rotary vacuum filter would need to be of an enclosed design as used in handling solvent and sometimes employed in blood plasma fractionation. Adsorption of plasmid DNA on the diatomaceous earth will not occur between pH 7 to 10, and this is further aided by avoiding the presence of divalent ions or masking them by complexing agents. Even then levels above 20 mM for potassium ions, 50 mM for sodium ions, and 150 mM for ammonium ions will lead to loss by adsorption (80) .

They noted the need to allow time for the cellulose to swell. The patent showed filtration to achieve a turbidity 4-fold lower than centrifugation, though even with washing yield was about 10% less.

The precipitation was done in the presence of filter aid, and the level of CTAB needed for chromosomal DNA and later plasmid DNA precipitation was assessed by a particle size probe analyzer, which detected the formation of large aggregates of filter aid and precipitate.

A patent (74) described anion exchange binding to an expanded bed with bag filtered extract with 7.5 L of anion exchange medium. The feed was 32 L of lysate treated with ribonuclease. The linear flow was 105 cm/h and the patent described a possible need for recycle to complete plasmid DNA binding. The bed was washed to remove particulates, and then elution was done with downward flow. If further chromatography was used, 7-14 L of eluate was diluted 13-fold and applied to two 10 L columns, and optionally detergents such as Triton X-100 or Tween 20 (0.1-1% v/v) were added to aid removal of endotoxins. Ferreira and colleagues (102) also examined expanded bed recovery with anion exchangers. They operated with an upward linear flow of 300 cm/h and an expanded bed height of 50 cm. Elution was with 1 M NaCl in downward flow at 120 cm/ h. Most of the RNA and protein was in the breakthrough, and high molecular weight RNA, chromosomal DNA, and plasmid DNA forms were eluted later as a single peak. If loading with more than one sedimented column volume equivalent of lysate was attempted there was medium clogging and channeling. This was eased by insertion of an intermediate propanol precipitation step, but they concluded that in this situation there was less justification for expanded bed operation. The difference in perspective from refs 74 and 100 may be due to the latter's use of ribonuclease and the consequent degradation of RNA and possibly to lower ionic strengths in loading. Published examples of really large scale expanded bed separation are rare, e.g., ref 103, where a column of 60 cm diameter \u00d7 100 cm was fed with 1377 L of fermentation broth containing a recombinant protein diluted to reduce the ionic strength.

As noted by others (21, 105) , a tenticular medium gained by its capacity to allow access of large macromolecules. Media designed for high porosity were the next most effective forms. By careful adjustment of conditions, resolution of plasmid DNA and RNA was achieved with a maximum dynamic capacity of 3 g/L. The paper emphasized the need for prepurification and proposed calcium chloride precipitation and cross-flow membrane separation. In a patent, Bhikhabhai (106) used calcium chloride precipitation prior to two stages of anion exchange. The presence of the calcium chloride altered the charge on the RNA so that it was more readily eluted, leaving DNA bound. The plasmid was separated from chromosomal DNA on a second anion exchanger by using a shallower gradient. A linear flow rate of 150 cm/h has been noted in loading a strong anion exchanger and 60 cm/h in eluting plasmid (107) . The step was preceded by alkaline lysis, filtration, diafiltration, PEG, ammonium acetate, and isopropyl precipitations and centrifugal separations. A silica-based anion exchanger has been described, and its application to clinical trial scale purification has been summarized (27) . With the use of a proprietary composite depth filter, this produced acceptable material evidently at least up to 25 g of plasmid and utilized about 1.4 kg/kg of wet weight biomass. Breul (86) has indicated that this material can completely separate RNA from plasmid DNA. In all such chromatographic and expanded bed methods, capacity is the key issue particularly with molecules as large as plasmid DNA. Dynamic capacities at 10% breakthrough in packed bed anion exchangers have been given that are below 0.4 g/L of supercoiled plasmid DNA for clarified lysate with no prepurification (105) . However, with a PEG fractional precipitation the binding capacities were 2-fold higher. The paper noted a capacity of conventional expanded bed adsorbents of 200 \u00b5m diameter of about 50 mg/L for plasmid DNA. In a patent (108) results were given to support use of poly(ethylene glycol) as a compacting agent during anion exchange and plasmid DNA with 1% PEG was more effectively retained.

The behavior with respect to precipitates will vary between pump types in the same manner as for protein precipitates (117) , with peristaltic pumps causing least damage and those such as screw pumps and especially centrifugal pumps with throttle valves causing much more. Lander and colleagues (58) note that there can be problems in filtering the ethanolic final precipitate and suggest the precipitated paste is centrifuged and added to 100% ethanol. This is mixed with a high speed homogenizer such as a rotor stator. The paste is simultaneously dehydrated and wet milled into hard particles that are amenable to filtration and drying. They also noted that material produced with the aid of hydrated calcium silicate will contain calcium and indicated its removal by EDTA in conjunction with ultrafiltration or precipitation. Finishing and formulation will be heavily influenced by the means of delivery to be used. The issues of shear sensitivity of the plasmid DNA can loom as large in operations such as injection into a vial as they do during purification, and losses in steps such as sterile filtration with such a large and flexible macromolecule can be substantial. Kong et al.

The processes may also have been superseded. However, they give some indication of the volumes involved and the quantities of reagents, adsorbents, and chromatographic media. The impact on process volumes of the alkaline lysis route is clear comparing Tables 2 and 3. In alternative routes beyond lysis that used precipitation these volumes could be further doubled. However, the initial downstream volume is about 15% of the original fermentation volume so that after harvesting there is a step change in scale. Table 4 is of interest because, though it is based on a pre-CTAB process patent, the data and the footnotes that have now been added indicate some column volumes based on a simple linear extrapolation to 1 m 3 of original lysate. Because the clarified lysate is diafiltered with a 100 kDa membrane, treated with ribonuclease, rediafiltered, and 0.45 \u00b5m filtered, the load on the anion exchanger is reduced versus that of the expanded bed of Table 3 . This and the use of a newer generation of porous chromatographic media is reflected in a much smaller required volume of absorbent.

In terms of preferred solid-liquid separation, cell harvesting by cross-flow microfiltration avoids cell damage caused by disk centrifuge discharge and any problems of cell resuspension. Centrifugation of neutralized lysate has proved workable and is also applicable to liquor from beneath a floated floc.

Table 1 allows some centrifuge comparisons. Though many disk centrifuges in antibiotics plants are involved in liquid-liquid separations, most are three-phase machines and can be converted to solid-liquid (clarifiers) by changing the ring dam diameter, though the riser channels in the disks may not be optimal.

However, microfiltration (122, 123) and ultrafiltration (124) are used for some cell harvesting on a production scale at relevant fluxes. The availability of centrifuges and filters for later stages will vary between products and plants. Depth filtration with recombinant proteins has been principally for secondary clarification where the solids are a residual contaminant rather than the product (125) . Because protein processes use disk centrifuges and large cross-flow microfiltation just at the front end, the train of solid-liquid separations implied in harvesting, separation of the post-lysis precipitate and potentially CTAB, hydrated calcium silicate and other precipitates will have to be achieved by reuse of the same centrifuges and microfilters. Chromatographic systems will be undersized for plasmid DNA, and this will be especially so if an existing initial step for protein production uses affinity chromatography, so reducing required subsequent capacity. It seems likely with less than ideal operations in non-purpose-designed plants, especially for solid-liquid separation, that the purities per stage will be poorer and it will be necessary to add steps based on different separation mechanisms. Expanded bed and chromatographic methods rest on the type of media available and older less sophisticated materials will produce poorer separation. Though cost would not be the primary consideration in a pandemic, Watson (71) noted a 10-fold reduction in capital by using the CTAB and hydrated calcium silicate procedures, which reflects the simplicity of equipment used.

An effective dose of 4 \u00b5g was observed in a recent phase 1 trial of a routine influenza DNA vaccine using gold particle delivery (126) . However, with a virus previously not experienced by the human population a higher dose may be required, so 10 \u00b5g per dose may be a reasonable estimate. There are indications that up to milligrams of plasmid DNA are needed without special delivery agents (15) , but this is not a level that could be contemplated and there are now a range of options in terms of particulate and other adjuvants (127, 128) that should reduce this. Wong and colleagues (129, 130) have shown that a DNA vaccine for influenza can be delivered to mice intranasally using liposome-encapsulated plasmid DNA. (For comparison, the dose of each of three hemagglutinin antigens in a virus-based vaccine is 15 \u00b5g. The expectation with virus-based vaccines is that a single dose is unlikely to be suitable considering the naivety of the population with regard to a pandemic virus and adjuvants may be needed (Fedson (5); http://www. emea.eu.int/pdfs/human/vwp/471703en.pdf)). There is evi-dence that priming with DNA followed by a boost with a protein-based vaccine is an effective combination (131) , and if there is a need for two doses, this could be a way to use virus-based vaccine sparingly. From the above, for a DNA vaccine in a best case, 40 million doses/m 3 of fermentation broth and related processing may be possible. However, without all the detailed know-how and tailored facilities an overall yield of one-fifth of the above is perhaps reasonable. If a 10 \u00b5g dose is again assumed with an overall yield of 80 g/m 3 , then 8 million doses/m 3 would be available. The inference from these figures and the uncertainties in them is that overall fermentation capacities in many countries would need to be of the order of tens of m 3 to quickly address populations rather than just front line groups. With a process cycle of 2-3 weeks, a distribution and immunization time of perhaps 5 weeks and a period of 3-5 weeks for development of immunity the overall cycle is quite long in relation to a pandemic. It suggests that antibiotics plants, commonly of 100 m 3 fermentation capacity, could represent a way to achieve the necessary speed, as well as being the only facilities in many countries. If they could address harvesting, lysis, clarification, and CTAB precipitation and recovery, the plasmid solids could be further purified in other smaller facilities. Filtration equipment capable of processing m 3 quantities is more common in chemical pharmaceutical facilities and could play a role. In the biopharmaceutical sector, media for mammalian cell culture are now shipped in m 3 quantities where sterility is also a critical issue.
