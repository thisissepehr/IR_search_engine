These compounds highly efficiently catalyze the trans-esterification reaction. The structure of these compounds is based on the block principle (combining in one molecule of functional groups exhibiting affinity for RNA (1.4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane residue) and groups that can catalyze the cleavage of phosphodiester bonds in RNA (imidazole and carboxylic groups). The study of the properties of this and other similar compounds led us to assume that aRNases can be used as agents efficiently inactivating RNA-containing viruses and, possibly, as antiviral drugs.

Similarly, the TBE virus was incubated with ABL3C3 aRNase in the same concentration range at 4 and 37 \u00b0 C, after which its titer was deter- At aRNase concentrations below 0.5 mM, the virus was inactivated incompletely even if the duration of its incubation with this agent was significantly increased. In view of this, we determined the ABL3C3 aRNase amount required for inactivation of one viral FFU. In these experiments, ABL3C3 aRNase was used at concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mM, whereas the virus titer (the FFU number) in the reaction mixture was varied. On the basis of these data it can be concluded that ABL3C3 aRNase at a concentration of 0.5 mM completely inactivated the virus suspension whose titer did not exceed 7-7.5 log FFU/ml. Similar results were obtained for the TBE virus.",

In some viral particles, the thickness of the envelope changed; however, the peplomers on the surface of viral envelope were retained (Fig. 2) . The degree of damage of the structure of virions directly depended on the ABL3C3 aRNase concentration and increased as the latter increased from 10 -7 to 10 -3 M. Nevertheless, according to the electron-microscopic data, even after a long-term treatment of the virus with 0.5 mM aRNase, many virions retained the envelope and peplomers.

These data indicate that ABL3C3 aRNase affects RNA-containing viruses with different genome organization (the influenza virus has a segmented genome with a negative polarity, whereas the unsegmented genome of the TBE virus has a positive polar-ity). The results of this study demonstrate the necessity of further studying and broadening the scope of application of aRNases, which can be used both as antiviral agents, taking into account the high virucidal activity of these compounds and their fairly low toxicity, as well as for inactivation of RNA-containing viruses in creating vaccines.",
