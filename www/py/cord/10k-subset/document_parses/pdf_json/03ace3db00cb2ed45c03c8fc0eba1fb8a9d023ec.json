However, H5N1 is so pathogenic that it is lethal to chicken embryos (4). The use of H1N1, a nonpathogenic strain, in combination with H5N1 did not produce the desired immunogenic response. The addition of MF59, an adjuvant, utilized to stimulate immune response, did increase antibody response significantly after two doses of the vaccine (4).The traditional vaccine approach is often time consuming and would be hard to increase production in a pandemic.",

One of the major risks associated with a live-attenuated virus is the potential to develop a recombinant virus if a person is already infected with a different strain of influenza (4) . The most promising system for developing an avian vaccine is through cloning of the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin genes inserted into a plasmid with H1N1 to obtain the eight segments of the virus (4). Plasmids have not produced chicken embryo mortality and produce an immunogenic response. However, the use of plasmids does not come without complications. The cell lines to grow the plasmids have to be quality approved. Also of consideration is that the viruses are considered genetically altered because of the reverse genetics systems used to clone the glycoproteins, which means that they have to meet safety regulations for research and vaccine development to occur (4) . In addition to safety regulations, companies manufacturing the vaccine must be licensed. Despite the complication of safety regulations and licensure, plasmid vaccines can undergo mass production in a short amount of time, which is essential in a pandemic.",
