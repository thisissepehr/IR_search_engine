This suggested that the replacement of the 3-acetate group of indole 1, which is in approximately the equivalent position as the amide of ASA, with an acetamide might mimic the desired interactions. That replacement yielded indole 3 (Table l ) , which has a 20fold enhanced activity in the chromogenic assay. The lack of a corresponding increased potency in the TBA is probably related to the anomalously low apparent K 8 for indole 1 which results from the combined inhibition of both hnps-PLA 2 and CO and thus masks the improvement of 3. The threefold decrease in activity of indole 3 toward the arachidonic acid responses indicates less inhibition of CO and a closer approximation of its true potency toward hnps-PLA 2 in this assay. The crystal structure of this complex was determined ( Table 2 ) and shows that the desired features were obtained. The active site calcium is retained (Fig. 4b) with the amide oxygen providing one of the calcium ligands.

In each of the substrate analogues, one non-bridging oxygen of the phosphate provides a ligand for the calcium, and the other nonbridging oxygen forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of residue 69 (either a lysine or tyrosine). In contrast indole 3 does not even extend into this region. But a convenient means by which to mimic the phosphate interactions ofTSA andASA is suggested by the orientation of the 5-0methyl group of3.

The initial acetamide, indole 3, has potency comparable to or better than that of TSA and ASA, even though it has less lipophillic contact surface and fewer polar and charged interactions with enzyme. A likely explanation for this is the constraints imposed by the indole ring and benzyl group which allow these inhibitors only a small number of conformations, one of which is fortuitously in the right shape for interacting with the PLA 2 cavity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A drug design success?"}, {"text": "It is useful to broadly consider the factors contributing to the 737-fold improvement in potency achieved in b this series of hnps-PLA 2 inhibitors. Most of this increase in binding has come from the addition or modification of polar or charged groups to enhance interactions with complementary groups of the enzyme. The conversion of the 3-position acetate to an acetamide provides a hydrogen bond to His 48 reminiscent of that documented for ASA, and also permits direct interaction with the active site calcium ion rather than displacement of it. Addition of an extension at the 5-position which is terminated with an acidic function mimics the phosphate groups of both ASA and TSA by coordinating to the catalytic calcium. Optimally fitting a small hydrophobic cleft at the 2-position also results in a corresponding increase in potency. While each change by itself has led to an incremental (3-to 20-fold) improvement, the summation of all of these changes impart a dramatic increase in potency to the molecule.
