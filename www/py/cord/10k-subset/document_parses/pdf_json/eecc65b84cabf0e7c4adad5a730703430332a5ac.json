Control of the infection is eventually achieved. Several studies have reported an essential role for CD4 + [1-3] and CD8 + [3, 4] T cells and for interferon (IFN)-g and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a [5] [6] [7] [8] in the control of acute infection.

In these studies, not only were these chemokines expressed, but T. cruzi-infected macrophages and cardiomyocytes also expressed NO, to mediate NO-dependent killing in vitro [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Moreover, we showed that mRNA for these chemokines was also expressed during acute infection in mice and that cytokines (i.e., TNF-a and IFN-g) known to participate in the control of infection modulated the expression of chemokines [14] [15] [16] . Given that chemokines are well known for their ability to induce the migration of leukocytes and the activation of immune cells, these previous studies suggested that, in addition to facilitating the production of NO, the expression of chemokines could drive the migration of inflammatory and immune cells to sites of parasite infection.",

No detectable expression of CCL3 and CCL4 mRNA and only a very low expression of CCL5 mRNA were found in the myocardia of uninfected wt mice. Infection with T. cruzi resulted in significant mRNA for CCL3 and CCL4 and enhanced mRNA for CCL5 in the myocardia on day 15 after infection ( figure 1A) . Moreover, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 were also detected by immunohistochemistry in the myocardia of infected mice but not in the myocardia of uninfected mice ( figure 1B) . Presence of the chemokines was clearly associated with infiltrated cells in cardiac tissue. As shown in figure 1B , there was a mononuclear interstitial infiltrate in the myocardia of infected mice that was positive for the presence of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 chemokines. The staining was most intense in the cardiac tissue obtained on days 17-20 after infection. In the myocardia of uninfected mice, no inflammatory infiltrate was present, and no staining for CC chemokines was observed.",

When we examined mouse cardiac tissue obtained during the acute phase of infection, we found that the inflammatory infiltrate was predominantly composed of CD8 + T cells ( figure 2C and 2D ). The quantification of T cells infiltrating the cardiac tissue (figure 3A) revealed that the majority of CD3 + T cells in the cardiac tissue of infected mice were also CD8 + (figure 3B). Other cells found in cardiac tissue expressed CD11c (11%), CD14 (7%), and CD56 (20%). Expression of CCR5 was found to be positive in the majority of leukocytes in inflammatory infiltrate (figure 2B), indicating that a significant amount of CD8 + T cells expressed CCR5. Indeed, double immunofluorescence labeling revealed that the majority of CD8 + T cells ( figure 2F ), but not of CD4 + T cells ( figure  2E) , expressed CCR5.

Incubation of splenocytes with the parasites or ConA did not alter the expression of CCR3 ( figure  4A ).

However, much less is known about the mechanisms governing the migration of leukocytes to sites of tissue infection, especially to hearts of infected hosts. More recently, a group of mediators, the chemokines, have been described in some detail and have been shown to participate in the recruitment of leukocytes in several models of inflammatory diseases [14, [22] [23] [24] . In the present study, we demonstrate an important role for CCR5acting chemokines in the control of leukocyte migration and parasite replication during the acute phase of infection with the Y strain of T. cruzi. This strain induces a parasitemia that peaks around days 9-11 of infection and causes an intense inflammatory reaction in cardiac tissue that is more intense between days 13 and 20 [25] .",

            "text": "Infection of macrophages [9] and cardiomyocytes [10] with T. cruzi trypomastigote forms is accompanied by the significant production of several chemokines, including CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5. Not only can the latter cells produce chemokines, but chemokines can also act on the cells to induce iNOS expression, NO expression, and the killing of parasites [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Thus, in the present study, it was important to ascertain whether chemokine expression would also occur in vivo after infection of mice with the Y strain of T. cruzi. Indeed, both mRNA and protein for CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 could be found in the cardiac tissue of T. cruzi-infected mice, in close correlation with tissue inflammation; these results are in agreement with the findings of other studies [14] [15] [16] . Notably, these latter studies showed that the expression of chemokines was greatly under the control of IFN-g and that the modulation of chemokine expression was accompanied by the modulation of the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of T. cruzi-induced inflammation [26] . Altogether, these studies and the present data demonstrate the close correlation between the expression of chemokines and the development of tissue inflammation after T. cruzi infection in vivo. Not only was the expression of chemokines enhanced, but the expression of CCR5, a receptor for CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, was also enhanced on infiltrating leukocytes in the hearts of T. cruzi-infected mice. More specifically, there was a marked increase in the number of CD8 + T cells expressing CCR5, as assessed by both immunohistochemistry and flow-cytometry analysis. The number of CD4 + T cells expressing CCR5 in the cardiac tissue of infected mice also increased, but to a lesser extent. Interestingly, the increased expression of CCR5 on tissue lymphocytes was mirrored by a significant increase in the expression of this receptor on circulating lymphocytes. Indeed, infection with T. cruzi, but not stimulation with ConA, also enhanced the expression of CCR5 on both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells cultivated in vitro. These results are in agreement with those of a recent study that showed that both CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + T cells obtained from the peripheral blood of infected patients expressed CCR5 to a greater degree than did those obtained from uninfected individuals [27] . In the latter study, the enhanced CCR5 expression on T cells was lost only when heart failure supervened chronic Chagas disease. Thus, infection with T. cruzi was accompanied by a parasite-associated increase in the expression of CCR5 and migration of T cells to infected tissues, in which several CCR5-acting chemokines are produced. The increased expression of CCR5 could be due to the production of IFN-g [28, 29] , TNF-a [8, 30] , interleukin (IL)-10 [7, 31] , and/or IL-12 [30, 32, 33] that occurs after the addition of trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi to cultures of splenocytes or after the infection of mice. Indeed, CCR5 expression is positively regulated by these cytokines [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

In these mice, a higher level of parasitemia and greater mortality was observed, compared with those in T. cruzi-infected wt mice. Moreover, the amount of parasites in the cardiac tissue of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice was greatly enhanced. The reduced control of parasite replication was associated with a dramatic reduction of the migration of T cells and overall disease, indicating that CCR5 was crucial to the migration of lymphocytes to the hearts of infected mice. Importantly, there was no defect in the ability of macrophages from CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice to produce NO and IL-12 or to kill the parasite in vitro (data not shown). Similar to our results in intracellular adhesion molecule-1-deficient mice [38] , the decreased number of lymphocytes in cardiac tissue was associated with decreased local production of IFN-g (data not shown) and an increased level of parasitemia, suggesting that there was a defect in the migration of cells capable of producing cytokines (such as IFNg) that activate the production of NO. Thus, the lack of CCR5 is accompanied by the inability of CCR5 + T cells to migrate to the hearts of infected mice and the inability of the host to control parasite replication. Similarly, absence of CCR5 leads to increased susceptibility to Cryptococcus neoformans infection, because of the absence of the migration of cells to the brain [18] . On the contrary, a defective trafficking of leukocytes in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice has been associated with (1) resistance to the development of cerebral malaria in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei [39] and (2) demyelination after infection with mouse hepatitis virus [40] .",
