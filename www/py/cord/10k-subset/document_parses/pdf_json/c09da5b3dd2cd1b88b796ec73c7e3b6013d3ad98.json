The dynamics of NF-kB-activation as well as its down-stream regulation of IL-8-expression in PMN following major trauma remain unclear. The aim of this pilot study was to analyse NF-kB nuclear translocation in relation to IL-8-mRNA-expression in PMN after major trauma. Patients and methods: PMN were isolated from blood samples of 15 major trauma patients (New Injury Severity Score, NISS > 16) drawn within 90 min and subsequently 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h after trauma. NF-kB-translocation was analysed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, EMSA and quantified by densitometry [arbitrary units], IL-8-mRNA-expression by RT-PCR, [copies/50 ng RNA]. Additionally, NF-kB-translocation and IL-8-expression in PMN of healthy volunteers were analysed natively (-control) and after LPS stimulation (+control). Results: NF-kB-translocation and IL-8-mRNA-expression was significantly increased in polytrauma patients (n=15; NISS: 34 \u00b1 8 [mean \u00b1 SEM]) initially. In non-survivors, NF-kB-translocation was significantly increased on admission and subsequently reduced within 6 h, while it increased in the survivors group. After 24 h, a second significant increase in NF-kB-activity and IL-8-expression was found in survivors that was subsequently reduced in both groups.

Additionally to superoxide and elastase synthesis [7, 8) , PMN are enabled to synthesize inflammatory mediators such as IL-8. PMN are characterized by a high turn-over which is especially regulated by apoptosis. Physiologically, PMN having fulfilled their function in the tissue, undergo apoptosis. Within the posttraumatic period a delayed apoptosis was demonstrated which can last up to 3 weeks after trauma [30] . NF-kB translocation was shown after various artificial stimulation such as hypoxia, LPS, TNFa and IL-6 [27, 32, 33] . While TNFa as well as IL-1\u00df were found elevated at the beginning of the posttraumatic inflammatory cascade, they both induce augmented secretion of IL-8 which leads to leukocyte recruitment and activation [18] . Cytokine synthesis is increased in the early posttraumatic period followed by hyporesponsiveness. Neutrophilic NF-kB induction with consecutive cytokine synthesis was shown after external stimulation [32] . NK-kB dependent inhibition of posttraumatic apoptosis was shown after in vitro stimulation by sera of major trauma patients [27] . Differential blood analysis provided a significant left shift in surviving patients. Such a left shift was not found in non-survivors later than 24 h post trauma. Surviving patients might exhibit lower apoptotic effects with consecutive stimulation of bone marrow towards increased granulopoesis [20] . Further more RelA was shown to play a key role in apoptotic regulation. Rel A deficient mice exhibited significantly increased apoptosis rate and embryonic lethality [20] . Apoptosis leads to diminished phagocytic capacity and synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators while pro-inflammatory reaction followed by reduced apoptosis rate in PMN and consecutive phosphorylation of I-kB was demonstrated [29] . Following the transcriptional NF-kB signalling, IL-8 expression was increased on admission to be rapidly reduced. IL-8 expression was shown to be mainly induced by NF-kB [3, 14] . Over the whole analysed period, significantly increased neutrophilic IL-8 mRNA expression was found after major trauma as compared to healthy volunteers. The initial increase of IL-8 mRNA expression over all patients appeared stronger than the up-stream NF-kB translocation. This phenomenon might be due to initial posttraumatic priming effects as well as to alternative transcriptional pathways responsible for IL-8 induction such as AP1 [38] . Further more, NF-kB undergoes degradation within 90 minutes after trauma. Reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators release due to I-kB stabilization following major trauma has been previously described [40] . While post mortem analysis of plasmatic IL-8 concentration revealed significantly higher values in traumatically deceased patients [19] , significantly elevated plasma IL-8 level was recorded in respect of developing MODS after major trauma [13] .
