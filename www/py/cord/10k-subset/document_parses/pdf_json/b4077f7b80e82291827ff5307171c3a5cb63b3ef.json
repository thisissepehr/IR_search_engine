The aim of this study was to investigate the Th17/Treg pattern in rats with gunpowder smog-induced acute lung injury. Wistar rats were equally randomized to three groups: normal control group, ALI 6 h group (smoke inhalation for 6 h) and ALI 24 h group (smoke inhalation for 24 h). We observed changes in cell counting in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alveolar-capillary membrane permeability and lung tissue pathology. Moreover, rats in ALI 6 h and ALI 24 h group showed increased expression of Th17 cell and related cytokines (IL-17 A, IL-6, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-23). Meanwhile, Treg prevalence and related cytokines (IL-10, IL-2 and IL-35) were decreased. Consequently, the ratio of Th17/Treg was higher after smoke inhalation. Additionally, Th1 cell decreased while Th2 cell increased at 6 h and 24 h after smoke inhalation. In conclusion, Th17/Treg imbalance exists in rats with smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of this disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Smoke inhalation injury is generally defined as inhalation of thermal or chemical irritants 1 , with a high incidence of pulmonary complications and mortality in burn patients and soldiers 2,3 . Military operations are complex, dynamic, and always dangerous because of toxic industrial chemicals and materials such as gunpowder. In military activities, gunpowder is used to shield the soldiers, attack enemy or simulate battlefield environments. Gunpowder can generate large amounts of toxic gases and particles during explosion and combustion. Smoke inhalation is the leading cause of acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or even serious respiratory failure in military personnel. Despite decades of intense research, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury are poorly defined. It is generally believed that inflammatory cells and release of inflammatory mediators, especially neutrophils and macrophages, are mandatory in the pathological process of smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury 4,5 . However, the role of adaptive immune cells in this disease is less well defined. A recent study indicated that lymphocyte-deficient mice were unable to increase neutrophils in response to lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that T lymphocytes may contribute to pulmonary inflammatory pathways in ALI 6 . Most recently, CD4 + T lymphocytes, especially regulatory T (Treg) cells and T helper (Th) 17 cells, have become an active topic of research in the pathogenesis or resolution of ALI/ARDS 7-11 . Both cell types are generated from naive T cells that require transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 with opposing actions 12 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Tregs plays an anti-inflammatory role mainly by contact-dependent suppression or releasing inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 on other immune cells, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells 13 . Reduced generation or deficient function of Tregs has been reported in a number of autoimmune diseases 14 . Notably, D' Alessio and colleagues' study showed that Treg modifies innate immune responses during resolution of lung injury, suggesting its potential role in treating ALI 15 . Particularly, Treg contributes to the resolution of fibroproliferation in ALI 8 . However, a recent study showed that an increased ratio of Tregs is an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with ARDS on admission 7 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "In contrast to Tregs, Th17 cell plays a potent proinflammatory role by producing the signature cytokine IL-17A.

Therefore, CD4 + T-lymphocyte-based therapeutic strategies may be more meaningful in ALI and provide us with a much broader intervention window. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that both losartan and alanylglutamine may protect mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury by suppressing Th17 immune responses and modulating the Th17/Treg balance in favor of Tregs, respectively 11,25 .

These results suggest that the imbalance of Th17/Treg may be involved in the pathogenesis of smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Con ALI 6 h ALI 24 h"}, {"text": "CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg is a critical sub-population of CD4 + T cells that is essential for maintaining self tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, for limiting chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease, and for regulating homeostatic lymphocyte expansion 27 . A recent report by D' Alessio and coauthors 15 investigated the role of lymphocytes in lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI. Their study showed that Treg depletion in wild-type mice delayed recovery, whereas Treg transfer into lymphocyte-deficient mice corrected the elevated levels of alveolar proinflammatory cytokines and increased the diminished transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and neutrophil apoptosis. In this study, we observed that CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Treg in peripheral blood was markedly decreased at 24 h after smoke inhalation. Our result is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that mice with chronic cigarette smoke exposure showed significant decrease in Treg prevalence in peripheral blood and Treg-related cytokine such as IL-10 28 . Generally, Tregs are supposed to play an anti-inflammatory role mainly by contact-dependent suppression, consumption of limiting T cell growth factors such as IL-2 or releasing inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 on other immune cells, including CD4 + T cells 13, 29 . Similarly, we found that CD4 + T cells were increased in peripheral blood of rats in response to smoke inhalation, which is consistent with lower percentage of Tregs. Na\u00efve CD4 + T cells differentiate into distinct functional subsets according to the local cytokine environment. The development of both Tregs and Th17 cells requires TGF-\u03b2 , whereas IL-2 and IL-6 are key regulators interfering with differentiation of Treg and Th17 from naive T cells 30, 31 . TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2 are essential for the development of Tregs 32 . IL-2 maintains Foxp3 + Tregs 33 and inhibits the polarization of Th17 cells 34 . IL-6 suppresses Treg differentiation 35 ; in contrast, Th17 differentiation is initiated by IL-6 together with TGF-\u03b2 36 . From our study, we found that gunpowder smog inhalation decreased IL-2 level in BALF and serum of rats. This result can explain the lower percentage of Tregs and the higher percentage of Th17 cells observed in rats with smoke inhalation. Moreover, Treg may attempt to resolve inflammation by producing IL-10, which is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the synthesis of many inflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 37 . As a novel identified inhibitory cytokine, IL-35 is specifically produced by Tregs and is required for maximal suppressive activity 38 . Our results showed that both IL-10 and IL-35 were decreased in BALF and serum of rats after smoke inhalation, which are consistent with lower percentage of Tregs after smoke inhalation. Notably, research showed that Th2 responses inhibit TGF-\u03b2 -induced Foxp3 expression and the formation of Tregs [39] [40] [41] . We found that gunpowder smog induced the Th1/Th2 imbalance favoring a Th2 shift. Thus, the decreased Tregs in rats with smoke inhalation are partly attributed to decreased level of IL-2 and enhanced Th2 immunity. Inconsistent with our study, an earlier report has shown that Treg percentage in peripheral blood was significantly higher in patients with ARDS than in control group 21 . The difference may be largely due to different study groups, limited scale of ARDS subjects, the course of the disease and methods for detecting Treg. Indeed, ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome that can occur as a result of multiple insults and diseases. Despite of a common end state, it is noteworthy that ARDS between pulmonary and extrapulmonary may differ in morphology and respiratory physiology as well as response to therapeutic interventions 42 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 295, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 342, "end": 344, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1327, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1330, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1784, "end": 1787, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1790, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1976, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2054, "end": 2056, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2520, "end": 2522, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2657, "end": 2659, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2959, "end": 2963, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2964, "end": 2968, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2969, "end": 2973, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3356, "end": 3358, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3810, "end": 3812, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Con ALI 6 h ALI 24 h"}, {"text": "As a more recently discovered effector subset of CD4 + T cells, Th17 cell plays a key role in defense against extracellular pathogens, and promotes many autoimmune inflammatory diseases 13 . A recent study showed that the peripheral circulating Th17 cells and their associated cytokines increased in patients with early ARDS and may conduce to ARDS 21 . In our study, Th17 cells in peripheral blood were increased in rats with smoke inhalation, implying the possibility that Th17-mediated immune response is involved in the pathogenesis of smoke inhalation-induced acute lung injury. We also found that the changes of IL-17A were consistent with the change tendency of Th17 cells. As a predominant product and key effector molecule of Th17 cells, IL-17A appears to play a pivotal role in promoting activation and recruitment of leukocyte such as neutrophils and macrophages at lung or airway inflammation [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . In addition, IL-17-deficient mice have an impaired neutrophilic response to allergen 48 . It may partly explain the increase of neutrophils and macrophages in BALF from rats with smoke inhalation in our study. The differentiation and development of Th17 cell are determined by the microenvironment. TGF-\u03b2 , IL-6, IL-23 and IL-1\u03b2 are all involved in the differentiation of human Th17 cells but IL-1\u03b2 is not needed in mouse 49, 50 . TGF-\u03b2 alone induces the differentiation into Tregs, but in an IL-1-and/or IL-6-rich inflammatory milieu, the Th17 generation is enhanced while the Tregs are suppressed 51 . In the present study, both TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 were increased in serum and BALF of rats with smoke inhalation, which may inhibit the generation of TGF-\u03b2 -induced Tregs and promote a pro-inflammatory T-cell response predominated by Th17 cells. IL-23 appears to be essential to expand and maintain Th17 cells and plays a crucial role in the establishment and maintenance of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Research has shown that IL-23 was increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 52 . In this study, the concentration of IL-23 was increased in serum and BALF of rats with smoke inhalation.

In fact, the balance between Th17 and Treg response has been suggested as a new paradigm for a number of inflammation and autoimmune diseases 13 . In the present study, the Th17/Treg ratio was markedly increased in peripheral blood of rats after smoke inhalation, indicating that the proinflammatory environment in rats with smoke inhalation was in favor of the generation of Th17 cells relative to Tregs. Moreover, a recent study revealed a previously unexpected role of adaptive immune responses that increase alveolar permeability in ARDS 53 . Similarly, our findings suggest that Th17/Treg imbalance contributes to increased alveolar epithelial permeability. Histological findings also showed that interstitial inflammation and lung injury were more severe in response to smoke inhalation.
