In the present paper, we develop a shorter, psychometrically improved measure of numeracy-the ability to understand, manipulate, and use numerical information, including probabilities. Across two large independent samples that varied widely in age and educational level, participants completed 18 items from existing numeracy measures. In Study 1, we conducted a Rasch analysis on the item pool and created an eight-item numeracy scale that assesses a broader range of difficulty than previous scales. In Study 2, we replicated this eight-item scale in a separate Rasch analysis using data from an independent sample. We also found that the new Rasch-based numeracy scale, compared with previous measures, could predict decision-making preferences obtained in past studies, supporting its predictive validity. In Study, 3, we further established the predictive validity of the Rasch-based numeracy scale. Specifically, we examined the associations between numeracy and risk judgments, compared with previous scales. Overall, we found that the Rasch-based scale was a better linear predictor of risk judgments than prior measures. Moreover, this study is the first to present the psychometric properties of several popular numeracy measures across a diverse sample of ages and educational level. We discuss the usefulness and the advantages of the new scale, which we feel can be used in a wide range of subject populations, allowing for a more clear understanding of how numeracy is associated with decision processes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Decision making today involves making sense of a morass of information from various sources, such as insurance companies, financial advisors, and marketers (Hibbard, Slovic, Peters, Finucane, & Tusler, 2001; Thaler & Sunstein, 2003; Woloshin, Schwartz, & Welch, 2004) .

Administering a measure that does not match the range of ability level of the population of interest, which may be the case for highly numerate populations such as college students or ones that are less numerate (e.g., older adults or those with lower educational levels), potentially limits the test's ability to discriminate ability level. Put differently, the items in the measure essentially become redundant as respondents answer all items correctly in the former case and incorrectly in the latter. Therefore, a numeracy measure with a greater range of difficulty would be desirable. In the current study, we developed such a measure by adopting an item response theory (IRT) approach.

Some scales have focused on subjective perceptions of one's own numerical abilities Woloshin et al., 2004; in an attempt to measure numeracy without directly asking participants to make any mathematical computations. These scales, at the face level, appear to measure individual differences in confidence to effectively utilize numeric information in and ability to conduct mathematical operations. One subjective test, the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS, Fagerlin et al., 2007; Zikmund-Fisher et al., 2007) , has been found to correlate with objective measures of numeracy. However, self-assessments of confidence are influenced by factors in addition to true ability level (Dunning, Heath, & Suls, 2004) , leading to potential concerns about the validity of such assessments. Other numeracy measures have focused on objective performance, testing individuals' ability to make correct computations and understand probabilistic information. These abilities are particularly important in understanding the risk and benefit information presented in many \"real-world\" decision-making contexts (e.g., health and financial contexts; Burkell, 2004) . Although both methods to assess individual differences in numeracy provide valuable insights, the current study focuses on the objective performance scales that have been used in the literature. Schwartz et al. (1997) developed one of the first performance-based numeracy measures. The measure was comprised of three items that included one question assessing participants' understanding of chance (i.e., How many heads would come up in 1000 tosses of a fair coin?) and two questions asking the participants to convert a percentage to a proportion and vice versa (i.e., the chance of winning a car is 1 in 1000; what is the percentage of winning tickets for the lottery?). Lipkus et al. (2001) further expanded this scale by adding eight questions to the Schwartz et al. numeracy scale; the additional items were designed to assess a participant's ability to understand and compare risks (e.g., Which of the following numbers represents the biggest risk of getting a disease: 1%, 10%, or 5%?) and to accurately work with decimal representations, proportions, and fractions. Moreover, Peters, Hibbard, Slovic, and Dieckmann (2007) further expanded the Lipkus et al. numeracy scale, introducing four additional items in an attempt to expand the range of difficulty; these additional items assess the understanding of base rates as well as the ability to make more complex likelihood calculations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 188, "text": "(Reyna et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 275, "end": 297, "text": "Woloshin et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 647, "end": 669, "text": "Fagerlin et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 670, "end": 698, "text": "Zikmund-Fisher et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 866, "end": 896, "text": "(Dunning, Heath, & Suls, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1333, "text": "Burkell, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1553, "text": "Schwartz et al.

Although the CRT was not explicitly defined as a numeracy test and only speculation exists about the underlying dimensions of the CRT, the items appear to require understanding, manipulating, and using numbers to solve them. Prior research has supported this assertion. For instance, Obrecht, Chapman, and Gelman (2009) found that the CRT was moderately correlated with SAT quantitative scores (r = .45; see Toplak, West, & Stanovich, 2011 for similar findings). In a smaller study, Cokely and Kelley (2009) reported a significant (r = .31) correlation between numeracy and CRT performance.

Recent reviews of the numeracy literature have found that compared with highly numerate individuals, those lower in numeracy are more likely to have difficulty judging risks and providing consistent assessments of utility, are worse at reading graphs, show larger framing effects, and are more sensitive to the formatting of probability information (for reviews, see Reyna et al., 2009) . Although numeracy typically leads to better decision making, there is evidence that the increased numerical processing observed in the highly numerate can lead to increased affective reactions to numbers, or number comparisons, which, in turn, can result in optimal or sub-optimal decision making. In an optimal example, Peters et al. (2006) asked participants to complete a ratio bias task. They were offered a chance to win a prize by drawing a red jellybean from a bowl. When provided with two bowls from which to choose, participants often elected to draw from a large bowl containing a greater absolute number, but smaller proportion, of red beans (9 in 100, 9%) rather than from a small bowl with fewer red beans but a better winning probability (1 in 10, 10%) even with the probabilities stated beneath each bowl. Peters et al. (2006) found that 33% and 5% of less and more numerate adults, respectively, chose the larger inferior bowl. Controlling for SAT scores, the choice effect remained significant. In addition, compared with the highly numerate, the less numerate reported less affective precision about Bowl A's 9% chance (\"How clear a feeling do you have about [its] goodness or badness?\"); their affect to the inferior 9% odds (\"How good or bad does [it] make you feel?\") was directionally less negative. Peters et al. (2006) concluded that affect derived from numbers and number comparisons may underlie the highly numerate's greater number use (cf. the \"Bets\" experiment in the present paper's Study 2 and Peters et al., 2006) . Frederick (2005) also found that individuals who performed well on his CRT were more likely to choose a future reward of greater value than a smaller immediate reward. Further, these individuals demonstrated evidence of weaker reflection effects (i.e., risk taking to avoid losses is greater than risk taking to achieve gains; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) , compared with individuals scoring low in cognitive reflection. High-CRT individuals also were less likely to show risk-averse preferences towards gambles when the relative expected value between choice options favored choosing an uncertain option. Moreover, Toplak et al. (2011) found that greater CRT performance was significantly associated with an index of rational decision making comprised of a collection of classic heuristics and biases tasks.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 560, "end": 579, "text": "Reyna et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 903, "end": 923, "text": "Peters et al.

In a Rasch model, responses are viewed as outcomes of the interaction between a test taker's standing on a latent trait or ability level and the difficulty of the test item. According to this model, the probability that an individual will correctly answer an item is a logistic function of the difference between the individual's trait level and the extent to which the trait is expressed in the item. Put differently, the higher a person's ability relative to the difficulty of an item, the higher the probability of a correct response on that item. When a person's location on the latent trait is equal to the difficulty of the item, there is, by definition, a .5 probability of a correct response in the Rasch model.

To achieve these goals, we incorporated items from all four measures that encompass a greater range of difficulty than any one of the scales.

Such a finding would suggest that the item pool that we intended to use would not tenably represent a coherent, unitary construct. To test whether the CRT and numeracy items load on a unitary factor, we compared two separate confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models: (i) a single-factor model in which all numeracy and CRT items loaded on a unitary factor and (ii) a correlated two-factor model with CRT items loading on one dimension and numeracy items loading on another factor. CFA is widely regarded in the broader psychological assessment literature to be the strongest test for unidimensionality, compared with exploratory factor analysis methods. CFAs were conducted using MPLUS version 6.1 software. A variance-adjusted weighted least squares estimation was used to estimate dichotomous variables in CFA. 2 Path parameters were freely estimated. Both the one-factor and two-factor solutions showed nearly identical fit statistics (see Table 1 for fit statistics and factor loadings). Given that the two-factor model does not offer an appreciably better model fit and the between-factor correlation was high (r = .85), the more parsimonious explanation of the data favors adopting a one-factor model. The data suggest that the assumption that the item pool represented a coherent, unitary construct is a tenable one; hence, Rasch-based scaling is appropriate. Table 2 shows the item difficulty statistics for all items (i.e., the proportion of participants correctly answering each item). On average, the Lipkus et al. numeracy items were less difficult, whereas the CRT items were more difficult. Next, we conducted a Rasch analysis on all numeracy and CRT items, following the procedure of Hibbard et al. (2005) . Initially, items were assessed for fit. In general, fit statistics should range from .5 to 1.5 (Linacre, 2002) . One item was deleted because of a poor outfit statistic. All other items met this criterion. To reduce the item pool further, items were deleted sequentially on the basis of the extent to which the deletion minimally reduced the person reliability. Person reliability is a measure of the ability of the scale to discriminate the sample into different levels of ability and, therefore, is a key construct in measure development using the Rasch technique.

The item that decreased person reliability the least was deleted, and the process was repeated. In the case of ties, items that were most similar to remaining items in difficulty were deleted.

Essentially, these analyses compare the simple effects of the interaction in terms of a linear contrast for numeracy, as construed by the different measures. For the Rasch-based measure, the effect size of the bets effect for those scoring highest in numeracy (seven to eight items correct; d = 1.06) was nearly four times as large as the effect size observed for those scoring lowest on the Rasch-based numeracy measure (zero to two items correct; d = .27).

The likelihood of each event was presented as either 5% or 20%. Each participant read both scenarios (their order was counterbalanced across subjects), and the numerical probability attached to each scenario was counterbalanced separately across subjects (i.e., numerical probability was a within-subject manipulation). After reading each scenario, participants reported their own perceptions of the likelihood of the attack or salmon extinction on a scale ranging from 0% to 100%. Because the goal of this analysis was to examine the associations between the different numeracy scales and likelihood perceptions in the two scenarios, we do not report the effect of the within-subject condition but instead focus on the correlational analyses for this study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Procedure"}, {"text": "Results and discussion Table 8 shows the correlations between perceived likelihood and the three different numeracy scales for the full sample, and for the lower-education (vocational school or less) and higher-education (some college or more) groups.

However, we anticipated the primary benefit of the Rasch-based measure to be in identifying linear effects across a range of educational levels. In particular, given the difficulty of the CRT, we expected attenuated correlations in the lower-education group. As predicted, the results demonstrate that the CRT showed the smallest correlations across both scenarios, with the Lipkus et al. and Rasch-based measures showing comparable effect sizes.

Inspection of the distributional characteristics of these measures demonstrates that the previously used measures are very skewed, which may limit their ability to discriminate an individual's trait level of numeracy. In general, the CRT appears to be very difficult, whereas the Lipkus et al.

Moreover, the Rasch-based numeracy scale retained a wide range of item difficulties. Further, we found that this scale approached a normal distribution in both samples, which we believe will ultimately lead researchers to treat numeracy as a continuous variable rather than as a dichotomous variable. We feel that this is an important contribution, given the potential limitations involved with dichotomizing variables (MacCallum, Zhang, Preacher, & Rucker, 2002) . Cronbach and Meehl's (1955) classic article first identified construct validity (i.e., how trustworthy is the score and its interpretation) as the most important form of validity in psychological tests.

The Raschbased measure demonstrates predictive validity comparable with that obtained in previous numeracy studies.

If we had started with a much larger initial item pool, it might be reasonable to expect multiple correlated facets of numeracy to be extracted that would represent sub-competencies of numeracy. Although previous research has typically added items on the basis of their face validity, we recommend that future scale construction efforts be based instead on accepted scale construction guidelines widely used in the assessment literature (e.g., Clark & Watson, 1995) . This process begins with the generation of an item pool based on theoretical considerations, such as those discussed in literature reviews and empirical inquiries (see Dehaene, 1997, and Reyna et al., 2009 , for influential reviews). Briefly, researchers should develop an over-inclusive item pool of various items and difficulty levels. Numeracy skills range from, but are not limited to, simple mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) to logic and quantitative reasoning, as well as comprehension of probabilities, proportions, and fractions. From this item pool, researchers would subsequently conduct multiple administrations of the items, refining the measure by removing ambiguous/poorly constructed and misfit items along the way. Scale development in this manner can result in the ability to make more fine-grained distinctions in numeracy across persons and to more extensively identify sub-competencies/facets of numeracy. From there, researchers will be able to better test if certain sub-competencies of numeracy are differentially important to particular types of judgment and decision problems.

As a consequence of adequately developing measures that assess numeracy sub-competencies in the manner that we have outlined, this method would add many more items to a numeracy scale. It would especially be the case if one wanted to adequately scale item difficulty and ability levels for each sub-competency. At the expense of being more comprehensive, it would undoubtedly add more time to assessments than even the longest numeracy measure that currently exists. Thus, researchers who may have limited assessment time or resources available (e.g., researchers interested in assessing numeracy in large nationally representative surveys) may opt for a shorter instrument, sacrificing construct fidelity for a broader bandwidth.

Panel D).Table 4 shows the descriptive statistics for each scale. As expected, the CRT was positively skewed, whereas the Peters et al. measure and especially the Lipkus et al. measure were negatively skewed. These findings suggest that both the Lipkus et al. measure and the CRT do not adhere to a normal distribution. On the contrary, performance scores for the Rasch-based numeracy scale were roughly normally distributed (M = 4.12, SD = 1.87, median = 4, mode = 4), and the distribution was not significantly skewed (.07, z = 0.11, ns). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the CRT, Lipkus et al., and Peters et al. scales, taken separately, may be too difficult or too easy, which may limit the sensitivity of the test to accurately detect an individual's true ability level on the latent construct.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Item difficulties for individual items-Study 1", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Difficulty structure and fit statistics for the eight-item numeracy scale-Study 1", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Item </td><td>Difficulty </td><td>Infit </td><td>Outfit\n</td></tr><tr><td>Q12 </td><td>89.0 </td><td>1.10 </td><td>.90\n</td></tr><tr><td>CRT1 </td><td>73.5 </td><td>.95 </td><td>.72\n</td></tr><tr><td>CRT3 </td><td>60.2 </td><td>.87 </td><td>.75\n</td></tr><tr><td>Q3 </td><td>57.9 </td><td>.84 </td><td>.76\n</td></tr><tr><td>Q2 </td><td>39.6 </td><td>1.24 </td><td>1.61\n</td></tr><tr><td>Q1 </td><td>29.8 </td><td>.90 </td><td>.77\n</td></tr><tr><td>Q9 </td><td>26.2 </td><td>1.02 </td><td>1.16\n</td></tr><tr><td>Q8b </td><td>15.2 </td><td>1.05 </td><td>.79\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Descriptive statistics for numeracy measures-Study 1", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Scale </td><td>Mean (SD) </td><td>Median </td><td>Mode </td><td>Skewness\n</td></tr><tr><td>CRT (three items) </td><td>0.83 (.99) </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>.88\n</td></tr><tr><td>Schwartz et al.\n(three items)\n</td><td>1.8 (1.01) </td><td>2 </td><td>2 </td><td>-.36\n</td></tr><tr><td>Lipkus et al.
