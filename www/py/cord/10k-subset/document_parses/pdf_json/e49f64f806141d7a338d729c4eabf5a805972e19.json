            "text": "NIOSH published a Federal Register Notice to explore the possibility of incorporating FDA required filtration tests for surgical masks (SMs) in the 42 CFR Part 84 respirator certification process. There have been no published studies comparing the filtration efficiency test methods used for NIOSH certification of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) with those used by the FDA for clearance of SMs. To address this issue, filtration efficiencies of \"N95 FFRs\" including six N95 FFR models and three surgical N95 FFR models, and three SM models were measured using the NIOSH NaCl aerosol test method, and FDA required particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) and bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) methods, and viral filtration efficiency (VFE) method. Five samples of each model were tested using each method. Both PFE and BFE tests were done using unneutralized particles as per FDA guidance document. PFE was measured using 0.1 \u00b5m size polystyrene latex particles and BFE with \u223c3.0 \u00b5m size particles containing Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. VFE was obtained using \u223c3.0 \u00b5m size particles containing phiX 174 as the challenge virus and Escherichia coli as the host. Results showed that the efficiencies measured by the NIOSH NaCl method for \"N95 FFRs\"were from 98.15-99.68% compared to 99.74-99.99% for PFE, 99.62-99.9% for BFE, and 99.8-99.9% for VFE methods. Efficiencies by the NIOSH NaCl method were significantly (p = <0.05) lower than the other methods. SMs showed lower efficiencies (54.72-88.40%) than \"N95 FFRs\" measured by the NIOSH NaCl method, while PFE, BFE, and VFE methods produced no significant difference. The above results show that the NIOSH NaCl method is relatively conservative and is able to identify poorly performing filtration devices. The higher efficiencies obtained using PFE, BFE and VFE methods show that adding these supplemental particle penetration methods will not improve respirator certification.",

            "text": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates a respiratory protection program in workplaces, which requires the use of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators [1] to reduce the inhalation of contaminant aerosol particles. In the last decade, respiratory protection has become an increasingly important issue in healthcare as respirators have routinely become an integral component of infection control to protect workers from diseases caused by respiratory pathogens. Healthcare workers are advised to wear NIOSH-certified respirators during close contact with patients with an aerosol-transmitted disease such as tuberculous [2] and measles [3] and during aerosol generating procedures done on patients with influenza [4] and Ebola. [5] NIOSH tests the filtration efficiency of particulatefiltering, air-purifying respirators for certification purposes. NIOSH approves N-, R-, and P-series non-powered air-purifying respirators, each at 95, 99, and 99.97% filtration efficiency levels under 42 CFR Part 84. [6] N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are commonly used in industrial workplaces. To measure the filtration efficiency, N-series FFRs are tested at a flow rate of 85 L/min using a charge neutralized polydisperse sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol with a count median diameter (CMD) of 0.075 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5m and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of less than 1.86. [7] NIOSH certification testing is considered as more stringent or worst-case method, because of the use of charge neutralized aerosol size close to the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) (\u223c0.050 \u00b5m for N-type respirators) at relatively higher flow rate (face velocity) to This article not subject to US copyright law. produce maximum penetration or conservative filtration efficiency. [8] [9] [10] Surgical masks (SMs) are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA does not do any testing; but reviews the information supplied by the manufacturers in their 510(k) premarket application. Manufacturers submit test results for fluid resistance, filtration efficiency for polystyrene latex (PSL) and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial aerosol particles, differential pressure and flammability for SMs clearance. These devices are used by healthcare personnel during medical procedures to protect both the patient and the healthcare personnel from the transfer of infectious microorganisms, body fluids and particulate material. [11] A SM is used as a physical barrier to body fluids and larger droplets in healthcare activities.",

For PFE testing unneutralized 0.1 \u00b5m polystyrene latex particles are used as per FDA guidance document [11] at 0.5 to 25 cm/sec face velocities as recommended by the ASTM F2299 standard. [12] BFE is measured using unneutralized S. aureus bacteria contained within an aerosol droplet with a mean particle size of 3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m diameter at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min as per FDA guidance and ASTM F2101 method. [13] Both PFE and BFE are done to measure the performance requirements for materials used in the construction of medical face masks (ASTM F2100-11). [14] These tests represent industry practices for characterizing the filtration performance of surgical mask material, not the entire mask. As indicated in the standards, these masks are not recommended for respiratory protection. However, the PFE and BFE for SMs are misconstrued by some as methods for determining filtration efficiencies acceptable for use in testing and clearance of respiratory protection devices. In fact, it is not uncommon for FDA 510(k) applications for surgical N95 FFRs to include BFE and PFE in addition to the NIOSH certification test data. [15, 16] One of the many challenges with the PFE and BFE test methods recommended by the FDA are that they are not clearly described in any single document, as shown in Table 1 . This table refers to several ASTM standards, but none of the test methods is strictly followed when submitting a 510(k) application to FDA. For example, FDA recommends the use of a whole mask for testing with 0.1 \u00b5m unneutralized PSL aerosol particles for measuring PFE as described by the ASTM F1215-89 standard, [17] which was withdrawn in 1999 and superseded by ASTM F2299 as recommended separately in ASTM F2100. On the contrary, the ASTM F2299 specifies testing SM material with charge neutralized PSL particles in the size range 0.1-5.0 \u00b5m at a face velocity in the 0.5-25 cm/sec range. In the case of BFE testing, the FDA guidance document recommends either the ASTM F2101 standard, Mil-M369454C or modified Greene and Vesley method. [18] This further complicates comparisons across methods because, ASTM F2101 testing is done with SM material, whereas, Greene and Vesley method uses the entire mask. The FDA guidance document does not clearly specify testing the entire mask or an area of the mask material for BFE testing.",

            "text": "The FDA guidance document and the ASTM standards overlook important factors necessary for measuring the filtration efficiency of SMs. The filtration efficiency of fibrous filter materials is controlled by factors including, aerosol charge, particle size distribution, face velocity and filter material charge. [19] [20] [21] [22] First, charge neutralized aerosol is known to produce maximum penetration (low efficiency). [21, 22] FDA refers the ASTM F1215-89 method (presently ASTM F1899) for PFE, but recommends the use of unneutralized PSL aerosol for testing. In the case of BFE, neither the FDA guidance document nor the ASTM F2101 has specified charge neutralization of the S. aureus aerosol. However, the aerosol used in the testing is assumed to be unneutralized. The use of unneutralized aerosol particles for filtration is known to overestimate filtration efficiency. Second, face velocity is another critical factor for filtration efficiency measurement. [23] For the PFE testing, FDA guidance document recommends the ASTM F1215-89 method (presently ASTM F1899), which specifies testing at 5-25 cm/sec velocity. Filtration efficiencies at 5 and 25 cm/sec are expected to be different. The variation in PFE results may not be comparable between SMs. FDA guidance document recommends the ASTM F2101 method as one of the BFE testing methods. As per ASTM F2101 method, BFE is tested at 28.3 L/min flow rate, while the area of the filter material is not specified. Testing filter materials with varying surface areas is likely to produce different efficiency values. Above all, the particle size distribution is an important factor when measuring filtration efficiency. The PFE and BFE tests use particles of 0.1 \u00b5m (monodisperse) and 3 \u00b5m mean particle size (MPS), respectively, with no rationale behind those decisions. Many studies show that inert and biological aerosols are captured by similar mechanisms. [24] [25] [26] The filtration efficiencies are different for various size particles. Particles closer to the most penetrating particle size should be considered for measuring a conservative filtration efficiency. The lack of specific test criteria to obtain a conservative filtration efficiency may produce inconsistent results. The wide variation in test conditions with the entire mask or a portion of mask material at different velocities using different size unneutralized aerosol particles is likely to produce a range of efficiencies for different masks, which is difficult to compare. Individuals who are not well acquainted with particle filtration mechanisms, frequently request additional evidence on inert vs biological aerosol penetration through respiratory devices. Thus, there is still interest in evaluating respirator filter efficiency using test methods involving a biological aerosol. However, numerous studies show that fibrous filters capture inert and biological aerosols by similar mechanisms. [24, 25, 27, 28] Aerosol particle filtration is dependent on physical characteristics including particle size, shape, density, charge status, filter media charge, and face velocity. ]8,29] Whether the particle is \"living\" or \"infectious\" plays no role in how well it will be collected by a filter. [30] Once a particle is collected it will remain attached by electrostatic and van der Waals' forces, [24] and although biological organisms have no capacity for moving through a filter on their own, a particle may be dislodged at higher air flow rates. [31] Because of this information, Brosseau and Shaffer [32] indicated that it not is necessary to test a respirator filter with a biological aerosol, but rather to focus on \"worse-case\" type test conditions. When properly selected and used, respirators tested using these types of filter tests should provide expected levels of protection against all types of workplace aerosols.",

A 2% (wt/vol) NaCl solution was aerosolized, charge neutralized and then passed through the convex side of a test sample properly sealed and placed into a filter holder. The particle size ranges from 0.022-0.259 \u00b5m with a count median diameter of 0.075 \u00b1 0.020 \u00b5m and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of less than 1.86. [7] The concentrations of NaCl aerosol upstream and downstream of the sample were measured at 85 L/min flow rate. The full NIOSH certification test typically takes approximately 90-100 min to load 200 mg of NaCl aerosol onto the respirator. In this study, we used an abbreviated method in which testing was stopped when the sample reached its maximum penetration level rather that continuing until the respirator was fully loaded with aerosol. Thus, the time to reach maximum penetration was different between different masks, but was typically less than 15 min. A previous study in our laboratory found that efficiencies obtained by measuring initial penetration (average of the first minute) of N95 FFRs were comparable to those done at maximum penetration at full loading conditions.

Penetration was measured using the bacteriophage phiX174 as the challenge virus and Escherichia coli bacteria as the host. A suspension of phiX174 was aerosolized in a nebulizer and each test was performed with a challenge level of 1700-2700 plaque-forming units (PFU) with a MPS of 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m for 2 min. The virus aerosol is a water droplet containing virus and not an individual virus particle. The MPS was calculated as shown for BFE method. The unneutralized aerosol sample was drawn through a test sample clamped into the top of a 6-stage Andersen sampler with agar plates inoculated with E. coli for collection. The flow rate was maintained at 28.3 L/min. The PFUs represent the number of viral aerosol particles or ",

This was validated by comparing the filtration efficiency obtained by the NIOSH NaCl method with the other methods. The NIOSH NaCl method yielded significantly (p = <0.001) lower efficiency levels than the PFE method for FFRs. This can be explained by the difference in the test conditions including, challenge aerosol size, charge status, and test velocity used between the two methods. Aerosol size is a critical factor for filtration efficiency measurement. The CMD (\u223c0.075 \u00b5m) of NIOSH NaCl aerosols used for NIOSH certification is much closer to the MPPS (0.05 \u00b5m) than the 0.1 \u00b5m size of the PSL particles used in the PFE test method.

The results can be explained by differences among the test methods. Both the BFE and VFE methods use \u223c3 \u00b5m diameter size particles containing S. aureus and phiX174 bacteriophage, respectively, at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min (face velocity 3.1 cm/sec). The larger diameter size (\u223c3 \u00b5m) particles containing S. aureus and phiX174 bacteriophage is far removed from the MPPS (0.05 \u00b5m) of N95 FFR models and is expected to produce lower penetration or higher efficiencies than the values obtained by the NIOSH NaCl method. It should be noted that the VFE method used \u223c3 \u00b5m droplets, even though the original size of phiX174 is 0.027 \u00b5m. Both, BFE and VFE methods use non-neutralized aerosols at 3.1 cm/sec velocity, which would likely produce relatively higher efficiency values. The test conditions including unneutralized larger aerosol size and lower velocity used in the BFE and VFE methods are relatively less challenging than those conditions used in the NIOSH NaCl method, and yielded higher efficiencies, as expected.

In the case of SM models, however, the NIOSH NaCl method showed lower efficiency values (54.72-88.40%) than the other methods (97.12-99.88%). The results are consistent with those reported previously. [37] In that study, the efficiencies ranged from 10-96% for the nine SM models tested using the NIOSH NaCl method. As expected, the results show that the NIOSH NaCl method is more sensitive compared to the other methods. The lower efficiencies for SMs than for FFRs may partly be due to the higher velocity (14.1 vs. 9.3 cm/sec) used for testing. However, previous studies with approximately similar size FFRs and SMs showed significantly higher penetrations or lower efficiencies for SMs. [25, 28, 38] Products with poor or mediocre filtration performance such as the SM models in this study can be consistently identified using only a more challenging method such as the NIOSH NaCl method used for NIOSH certification of particulate respirators. This confirms earlier reports from other laboratories, [37, 39] and ours on SMs, [40] non-NIOSH certified dust masks, [41] and cloth masks. [42] The filtration efficiencies obtained by the different methods in the study may have implications for respirator use in healthcare environments. The results showed that the NIOSH NaCl aerosol method used for NIOSH certification is more challenging than the PFE, BFE, and VFE methods. The efficiencies measured using different methods showed that the NIOSH NaCl method is more conservative than the other methods.

The BFE and VFE results for \"N95 FFRs\" did not show any significant difference indicating that VFE method is not different from BFE method. SMs also showed no difference in BFE and VFE values. VFE could be differentiated from BFE and made more challenging if testing were done using a method to create a smaller aerosol size near the MPPS. Hogan et al. reported that aerosol size distribution is controlled by the properties of the aerosolized liquid and the method of aerosolization, not by the physical size of the virus. [43] For example, in one study, MS2 virus aerosols (\u223c0.05 \u00b5m) showed higher penetrations (lower efficiency) for N95 FFRs. [39] Another study generated an aerosol CMD of \u223c0.1 \u00b5m using viable H1N1 influenza to challenge N95 FFRs. [44] Thus, if there was interest, more challenging VFE methods could be developed by a standards development organization, although a modified VFE with an aerosol challenge in the MPPS range would still be considered unnecessary for determining FFR efficacy as noted previously. [44] The VFE method used in this study is adapted from the ASTM F2101 standard and is not being recognized by standard organizations. VFE method used in this study should not be considered useful for characterizing filter material efficiency. Unfortunately, some manufacturers report VFE for SMs to make marketing claims and it has been used in FDA 510(k) applications.",

The models I and E are both flat folding respirators from the same manufacturer and visually appear to be identical except for color (one is orange and the other is white). Similarly, the models H and B are identical in appearance, except for the labeling and packaging. As shown in Table 3 , both pairs exhibited similar filter efficiencies. There was no difference in measured filtration efficiency for BFE and VFE between FFRs that are FDA-cleared (H and I) and NIOSH-certified FFRs and FFRs that are only NIOSH-certified (B and E). Thus, additional tests involving a bioaerosol (e.g., BFE and VFE) included in some FDA 510(k) applications do not add any new information useful to a regulatory or certification agency. Furthermore, this data suggests that non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs would be a viable option for respiratory protection during surgical N95 respirator shortages for situations where fluid resistance [45] and flammability resistance may not be necessary. The increased use of respirators in healthcare facilities can result in a shortage during a pandemic or an outbreak involving a respiratory pathogen. [46] [47] [48] [49] Moreover, N95 FFRs are generally less expensive than the surgical N95 FFRs. Manufacturers would prefer to get NIOSH certification and FDA clearance in a single-step process and use of a single filtration test by both agencies would be a positive step towards this objective.",

Furthermore, PFE, BFE, and VFE suffer from the lack of precision and lack of well-defined and documented testing protocols. We conclude that addition of supplemental particle penetration methods such as PFE, BFE, and VFE to the requirements described in 42 CFR Part 84 will not provide any improvement in the current 42 CFR Part 84 respirator certification process.",
