Leukocyte enumeration was performed; functional responses of NK cells and CD4 T cells were analyzed, and soluble factors such as cytokines, defensins, and steroid hormones were measured in maternal blood. Results In comparison to the post-partum period, the latter part of pregnancy was characterized by significant increases in blood phagocytes and pDCs and decreases in the number and activity of NK and T cells. Alterations were found in antimicrobial proteins and serum cytokines. Conclusions These data show that pregnancy is not a period of immunosuppression but an alteration in immune priorities characterized by a strengthening of innate immune barriers and a concomitant reduction in adaptive/inflammatory immunity in the later stages of pregnancy.",

Numerous reports suggest that influenza infection results in increased morbidity and mortality during pregnancy with the greatest risk in the second and third trimesters [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In all recorded influenza pandemics including 1918, 1957, and 2009 , pregnant women exposed to the pandemic strain experienced significantly increased death rates [6, 7, 10] .

Medawar hypothesized that some type of immune suppression must occur to allow a semi-allogeneic fetus to escape attack. Subsequent research at the maternalfetal interface and maternal peripheral circulation resulted in sometimes conflicting hypotheses, including that pregnancy involves a shift toward Th2 immunity [17] or variants thereof [18] , a controlled state of inflammation [19] , or a combination of both depending on the stage of pregnancy [20] . Evidence for and against each of these hypotheses can be found in the literature. In no small measure, the lack of consensus on the exact nature of phenotypic changes to immunity during pregnancy can be explained by limitations in previous investigations, including differences in study design, the use of animal models, or a focus on one narrow aspect of immunity. Additionally, the anatomical site of analysis (peripheral blood/ spleen versus uterine environment) may have a profound impact on the conclusions drawn. Study design is critical. Most published studies have been cross-sectional, but substantial interpersonal variability in immunologic parameters poses a significant challenge to data interpretation.",

This approach differed from other investigations which focused primarily on the maternal-fetal interface, an approach that was used as the basis for the Th2 hypothesis [17] . That report found no bias toward Th2 cytokine production from unstimulated or ConA stimulated splenocytes during pregnancy [21] . Other groups that suggested an inflammatory view of pregnancy either focused on the maternal-fetal interface or on particular cell types, such as monocytes, that they reported to have increased activity [22] . In our longitudinal study, blood was collected from women three times during pregnancy and twice in the post partum period in an effort to monitor some elements of the immune system known to be important for influenza virus control. Cellular and soluble components of blood representing innate and adaptive immune elements were analyzed. In order to remove the influence of interpersonal variability in immune response, each woman's pregnant immune profile was compared to her own 6-month measurements. In this paper, we present the alterations and compensatory changes we observed in maternal blood cell counts, NK, and T cell function and serum defensins as pregnancy progressed.",

The secretion of IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and IL-6 was increased over the steady state by stimulation, but the reduction in cytokine production during pregnancy remained significant, and for many cytokines was over a 50% reduction. In total, these data confirm a repression of NK cell number and function in the periphery in the second and third trimesters. T lymphocytes in blood were also decreased during pregnancy (Fig. 6) . Both CD4 and CD8 T cells levels are significantly lower by 20 weeks of gestation. The percentage of CD3 cells in the total blood decrease from~25% to 15% by week 26, although the ratio of CD4 to CD8 remains constant through gestation, suggesting that a specific T cell subtype is not being affected.",

Freshly isolated CD4+/CD45RO-(na\u00efve CD4) cells, upon stimulation with the superantigen TSST for 48 h, demonstrate a broad but selective suppression of cytokine secretion in the second and third trimesters (Fig. 7) . Both Th1 (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1) and Th2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-13, IL-6) were downregulated. No significant difference was seen with IL-4 although the expression was quite low. The secretion of IL-2 appeared to be enhanced in the first trimester but otherwise not significantly regulated during pregnancy. In contrast to the other cytokines, IL-8 secretion was enhanced from T cells during pregnancy. These findings suggest a selective suppression of CD4 T cell cytokines during the second and third trimesters, although not along the conventional Th1/Th2 dichotomy. The cells were not functionally inert, as secretion of IL-8, IL-4, and IL-2 was the same or enhanced compared to the post partum period.",

Additionally, many studies of the immunology of the human maternal-fetal interface compare unremarkable pregnancies to those complicated by adverse pregnancy outcomes. In these cases, it is impossible to disentangle the consequences of the disease from those inherent to immunological adaptations of pregnancy. Our longitudinal study reduces interpersonal variability by comparing each woman's immune function during pregnancy to her own response 6 months post-partum, thus eliminating the negative influence of interpersonal variability in immune profile. We also took a comprehensive approach to evaluating immunological adaptations in pregnancy, examining activity of cells in both innate and adaptive immunity, along with serum hormone levels, \u03b1-defensins 1-3, and peripheral blood cytokines.

By week 35, the absolute number of CD56dim cells declined by over 60%. The cells that remained had reduced spontaneous cytokine secretion as well as reduced secretion of cytokines when stimulated with either IL-12/IL-15 or with IL-2 (data not shown). NK cells play an important role in pregnancy. Uterine NK cells serve critical functions in trophoblast invasion as well as spiral artery remodeling [36, 37] . Loss of NK cells early in gestation may therefore be deleterious to the pregnancy, possibly resulting in poor placental invasion and perfusion. Placentation is completed by 20 weeks' gestation; thus, the declines in NK cell count and activity that we observed in late pregnancy may be consistent with their physiological functions. [38] . The theory that pregnancy requires a shift to a Th2 bias has been widely touted as well as widely criticized. Our data does not suggest any increase in Th2 cytokines in the serum [23] or from stimulated blood CD4 cells; in fact, we show that IL-10, IL-6, and IL-13 are downregulated along with Th1 cytokines throughout pregnancy in stimulated na\u00efve CD4 T cells. The suppression of T cell activity is selective however. We found no decrease of IL-8, IL-2, and IL-4 secretion from na\u00efve CD4 T cells during pregnancy.",

Populations of B cell precursors are reduced in the bone marrow. However, estrogen appears to increase survival and expansion of B cell subsets. Estrogen administration in vitro increases IgM and IgG production from PBMCs [39] , and estrogen administration in vivo can lead to the increase of autoantibody production in SLE mouse models [40] . Together, these data suggest that pregnancy or associated hormones might negatively regulate new B cell development while enhancing antibody production in mature B cells. In our cohort, B cells were reduced in the periphery during the third trimester relative to the postpartum measures. However, from our influenza vaccine cohort (Sperling et al., manuscript in press), we found no loss of antibody response to the inactive flu vaccine during pregnancy. It can be argued that due to past exposure of antigenically similar virus strains, the influenza vaccine response is mostly reliant on a memory response [41] , while estrogen reportedly affects na\u00efve precursor B cells. In a previous report analyzing the expression of serum cytokines from our cohort, we noted that serum cytokines are uniquely regulated during pregnancy [23] . Proinflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 have divergent regulation, with IFN\u03b3 decreasing during pregnancy while the expression of TNF\u03b1 increases. Although it is unclear what the overall consequence of this regulation is in vivo, we showed that circulating NK cells secrete more IFN\u03b3 in patients with high serum concentrations of IL-12, suggesting that these serum cytokines are functionally active in vivo. We further showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were treated with mid-pregnancy serum were less able to inhibit viral replication than cells treated with post-pregnancy serum, suggesting that other cytokines, i.e., type I and II IFN, are active against virus infection in concentrations found in serum.",

As these are known to be vital and effective barriers to infection, their elevation might suggest no increase, and possibly even a decrease, in susceptibility during pregnancy. However, once an infection is established, the decreased efficacy of the important anti-viral effector cell populations (NK and T cells) during the late second and third trimesters, may compromise viral clearance, and these changes may underlie the reported increase in disease severity that have been reported in other studies [10] [11] [12] .

            "text": "Why systemic immunity changes in response to pregnancy remains unclear. Is there a need to protect the fetus because of its antigenic content, or are strong pro-inflammatory systemic responses harmful to the developing fetus? In the first scenario, the local immune regulation critical for blocking rejection of the fetus affects systemic responses non-specifically. For example, Tregs that might be generated against paternal or male antigens can produce cytokines that will act to suppress responses to other stimuli. If this is the case, then the altered immune response to influenza and other pathogens is merely a side effect of suppression of the alloresponse and any therapeutic efforts to bolster antiviral immunity might not be detrimental to mother or fetus. However, it is also possible that strong pro-inflammatory systemic immune responses to any target might be detrimental to the developing fetus and must be regulated. In this scenario, efforts aimed at increasing the immune response to an acute infection acquired in the perinatal period may have adverse effects on fetal survival. Studies are currently underway to address this question.",

            "text": "In summary, data from the current study as well as our other analyses from the VIP cohorts, strongly support a picture of suppression of selective elements of maternal immunity that are accompanied by compensatory changes to strengthen the barriers against the establishment of infection. Among subjects in our study, a substantial increase occurred in the level of phagocytes, serum cytokine levels change drastically, and serum defensins are elevated. Moreover, there was a striking rise in the type 1 IFN producing plasmacytoid DC population. However, in concert with these alterations, NK and T cell number and function decreased markedly, especially during the late second and third trimesters, indicating a shift away from inflammatory Th1 responses and the production of IFN\u03b3. Moreover, both NK and na\u00efve T cells showed constitutive changes in a number of gene products in the steady state. In contrast to the prevailing hypothesis, we found no indication of a rise of Th2 cytokines. While peripheral B cell numbers were observed to decrease in the third trimester, no loss of B cell response to the influenza trivalent vaccine was found in our other cohort (Sperling et al., manuscript in press). Overall, these changes can be characterized as a shift in the priorities of the systemic immune system with a selective repression of maternal immune responses and a shift to defensive immunity.",
