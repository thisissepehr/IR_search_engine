However, most of the reports analyzed data from DDLT. Few studies have reported the outcomes of retransplantation from living donors [9, 10] . Since the first successful LDLT in 1989, the operation has been accepted throughout the world as a fundamental treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease [11] [12] [13] . There has been a great deal of discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of LDLT [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Needless to say, the performance of such an invasive procedure in the living donor remains controversial [19] . In Japan, less than 50 DDLTs are performed each year [20] ; thus, we are forced to rely on living donors, even at the time of retransplantation. It is therefore necessary to understand the relevance and adaptations of this procedure. In general, the indications for Re-LDLT are as follows: (1) the patient's general condition indicates that he or she might be able to withstand reoperation; and (2) the presence of an appropriate living donor. A Kyoto group reported that ICU care, a shorter interval between primary LDLT and Re-LDLT, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated creatinine, and apheresis were independently associated with poor outcomes after pediatric Re-LDLT [9] . In our institution, retransplantation was contraindicated in 13 patients due to a poor general condition. Most of these patients suffered from some fatal complications that affected the heart or respiratory functions (which affected their ability to withstand reoperation), or severe infection after primary LDLT. Recurrence of the primary malignant disease (such as hepatoblastoma) was also considered to be a contraindication due to the risk of recurrence in the second liver graft after Re-LDLT. These factors, which might have shown the validity of our indication for Re-LDLT, did not reach statistical significance due to the limited number of Re-LDLT patients. In the Re-LDLT setting, the age of the recipient was found to have a negative impact on recipient survival. Even though the rate of mortality was higher among young recipients in previous reports [9] , the survival rate of the younger patients in our study was good. The discrepancy in the results suggests the need for further consideration to determine more appropriate indications for Re-LDLT. There had been some discussions about the proper timing of retransplantation. Some reports have mentioned that later transplantation was better than earlier transplantation for improving patient survival after retransplantation [4, 7, 9] . Even though the period between primary LDLT and Re-LDLT was not found to influence survival in the present study, it might be important to try avoiding surgery in the acute phase after primary surgery as the patient would be less likely to withstand reoperation. The lower rate of early retransplantation in comparison to other studies might be attributed to our treatment protocol after primary LDLT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 149, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 150, "end": 153, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 293, "end": 296, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 297, "end": 300, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 478, "end": 482, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 483, "end": 487, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 579, "end": 583, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 584, "end": 588, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 589, "end": 593, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 594, "end": 598, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 599, "end": 603, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 711, "end": 715, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 771, "end": 775, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1384, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2250, "end": 2253, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2679, "end": 2682, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2683, "end": 2685, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2688, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our Re-LDLT cases, the most common primary disease was BA, while the most common cause of graft loss was chronic rejection. This was consistent with previous reports. Although Sieders et al. [6] mentioned the fact that BA as a primary disease negatively influenced survival after retransplantation, it was not a significant factor in our cases. In one case involving a patient with PFIC-1, a primary liver graft with steatohepatitis was lost. PFIC refers to a group of familial cholestatic conditions caused by defects in the biliary epithelial transporters that usually leads to cirrhosis. The clinical course and outcomes of PFIC-1 recipients after LDLT are reported to be insufficient due to steatosis and fibrosis [21, 22] . In our case, the patient with PFIC-1 had developed steatohepatitis 8 years after primary LDLT. As PFIC-1 patients will require liver transplantation during the long-term progression of the disease, further strategy improvements and the elucidation of the mechanism of PFIC recurrence are crucial in LDLT for PFIC-1 patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 197, "text": "Sieders et al.

The operative time and bleeding volume in Re-LDLT were much higher in comparison to primary LDLT, reflecting the difficulty of the Re-LDLT procedure. Under such unfavorable conditions, the outcome of our Re-LDLT cases is good in comparison to previous studies. The main reason for this is the small number of vascular complications after Re-LDLT. Previous studies reported that the incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) after pediatric retransplantation is up to 10% [23] [24] [25] . HAT might lead to fatal graft failure and should be avoided to allow the patient to survive the acute phase after Re-LDLT [26] . None of the Re-LDLT cases in our study involved the development of postoperative HAT; the introduction of microsurgical reconstruction might have contributed to this good result. In the Re-LDLT cases, re-laparotomy after primary LDLT and gastrointestinal complications after Re-LDLT had a negative impact on patient survival.

Based on the preoperative investigations for pulmonary hypertension, it was decided that the patient would be able to withstand the Re-LDLT operation. Death occurred due to pulmonary hypertension, which suggests the need for further study and appropriate assessment before operation. In case 6, the patient showed a poor nutritional condition due to intractable diarrhea, which developed due to the patient's primary disease (PFIC-1). The patient's condition may have led to vulnerability to infection after Heffron et al. Re-LDLT.
