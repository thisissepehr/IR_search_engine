Using Theiler's virus infection of SJL mice as a model of this type of disease, we have investigated the roles of two chemokines-regulated on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) chemokine and monokine induced by IFN-c (MIG)-by treating mice with antisera that block lymphocyte migration. Control, infected mice showed virus persistence, mild inflammation and a small degree of demyelination in the white matter of the spinal cord at 6 weeks post-infection. Treatment of mice with RANTES antiserum starting at 2 weeks post-infection increased both viral antigen expression and the severity of inflammatory demyelination at 6 weeks post-infection. MIG antiserum increased the spread of virus and the proportion of spinal cord white matter with demyelination. Overall, viral antigen levels correlated strongly with the extent of pathology. At the RNA level, high virus expression was associated with low IL-2 and high IL-10 levels, and RANTES antiserum decreased the IL-2/IL-10 ratio.

The first phase is characterized by transient encephalitis within the first 2 weeks of infection due to rapid viral replication in the brain. In the second phase the virus moves to the spinal cord at 7-14 days post-infection (d.p.i.) and establishes lifelong infection in the white matter of the cord. The Daniel's strain (DA) of TMEV persists within oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and macrophages/microglia. Viral persistence results in chronic inflammation by lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as activation of central nervous system (CNS) glia, which leads to extensive demyelination, axonal degeneration and progressive neurological deficits starting at 2-3 months post-infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Theiler's virus induces the production of a variety of chemokines in the CNS-molecules that regulate migration and function of inflammatory cells. Similar patterns of chemokine expression develop in the CNS after infections with different strains of TMEV and with other viruses (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Some of the major chemokines are regulated on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted chemokine (RANTES; CCL5), monokine induced by IFN-c (MIG; CXCL9), interferon-c inducible protein-10 (IP-10; CXCL10), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1; CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a; CCL3) and MIP-1b (CCL4). Most are up-regulated within several days of infection and remain elevated as long as viral infection and/or tissue injury persists. A primary role for these chemokines is to facilitate infiltration of virus-reactive lymphocytes. For example, lymphocyte infiltration promoted by MIG and IP-10 during mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection serves to limit viral replication and reduce mortality (12) (13) (14) . In contrast, inflammatory responses also potentially are injurious to normal tissues, and therefore under some conditions chemokine production could be harmful. Theiler's virus infection of SJL mice is one such example where the role of chemokines cannot be easily predicted because the inflammatory response has two prominent and contrasting effects. CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes are necessary for preventing mortality throughout infection, but their infiltration into the CNS over the long term also leads significantly to myelin and axonal destruction. Antiviral responses in SJL mice are insufficient to clear virus, at least in part due to a lack of virus reactivity of most infiltrating lymphocytes (15) . Therefore, virus and the resulting inflammatory response persist lifelong in the spinal cord. The secondary development of autoreactivity might also play a role in chronic disease (16) . Thus, chemokines probably exert both positive and negative effects concurrently in this model.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 281, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 290, "end": 293, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 294, "end": 297, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 298, "end": 301, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 302, "end": 305, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 306, "end": 309, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 310, "end": 313, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 314, "end": 318, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 319, "end": 323, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1050, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1055, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1060, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1763, "end": 1767, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1954, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The two chemokines that we investigated in the present study were RANTES and MIG.

The neutralizing activities were confirmed using in vitro chemotaxis assays. Cells responsive to RANTES (splenocytes from MHV-infected mice) or MIG (300-19 cell line) were seeded into the upper chamber of transwell plates, and recombinant chemokines and antisera were placed in the bottom chamber. Cell migration into the bottom chamber was induced by the presence of the chemokines. Anti-MIG antiserum reduced cell migration by a maximum of 75%, whereas anti-RANTES blocked migration completely (Fig. 1) . Thus, these antisera neutralized most or all chemokine-specific activity. 2) . One exception was a modest increase in IL-10 mRNA by RANTES antiserum (Fig. 2D) . When gene expression for each of these molecules was analyzed in the two experiments separately, only for IL-10 were mRNA levels different between treatment and control groups following two antiserum injections but not following a single injection. Thus, chemokine neutralization had few, lasting effects on the expression of immune-related genes. More interestingly, we discovered important relationships among IL-2, IL-10 and VP2. Firstly, expression of IL-2 was inversely related to the expression of IL-10 (r = \u00ff0.58, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2E ). Mice with high IL-2 levels had low IL-10 levels in the CNS, and vice versa. Secondly, analysis of the IL-2/IL-10 ratio revealed a shift toward IL-10 expression with anti-RANTES treatment (P = 0.02; Fig. 2F ). Thirdly, we found that levels of both IL-2 and IL-10 correlated VP2. That is, IL-2 RNA decreased (r = \u00ff0.50, P = 0.01; Fig. 3A ) and IL-10 increased (r = 0.88, P < 0.0001; Fig. 3B ) in proportion to increasing levels of VP2 RNA. Finally, the IL-2/IL-10 ratio correlated strongly with levels of VP2 RNA (r = \u00ff0.73, P < 0.0001; Fig. 3C ). Mice with the lowest ratio of IL-2/IL-10 had the highest levels of VP2. Interestingly, the cytokine RNA levels varied across only a 3-fold range (0.5 log units) while VP2 RNA levels varied across a 100-fold range (2 log units).

Activated CD4 cells with a T h 1 phenotype are the preferential targets of RANTES and MIG (33, 37, 38) and are also known to be important for virus control. Thus, a decline in antiviral activity is expected from anti-RANTES and anti-MIG treatments. Also in support of our hypothesis, virus titers and CNS pathology increase following antibody-mediated depletion or genetic knockout of CD4 lymphocytes (11, 23) .

Thus, viral RNA levels appear to be less responsive than virus antigen or infectious virus (plaques) to immunomodulation. An important question still to be resolved in the Theiler's field is the mechanism by which virus determines the extent of CNS pathology. One hypothesis is that TMEV causes direct cytolysis of CNS cells. The DA strain of Theiler's virus persists in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, but direct cytolysis of these cells appears to be limited (39, 40) . In immunostained spinal cord sections we found only occasional, highly distended, infected cells. In addition, immunocompromised RAG\u00ff/\u00ff mice infected with Theiler's virus do not show significant demyelination prior to death at 3 weeks postinfection, even when virus is injected directly into the spinal cord, implying a limited degree of cytolysis (M.R. unpublished observations).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 92, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 297, "end": 301, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 789, "end": 793, "text": "(39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 794, "end": 797, "text": "40)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The more likely explanation is that the extent of virus expression determines the strength of the immune reaction, which in turn elicits secondary injury to myelin and other CNS cells. One of the best examples of this mechanism involves the adoptive transfer of immunocompetent splenocytes into infected, immunodeficient SCID mice (41) . Increasing the number of transferred splenocytes is able to prevent TMEVinduced mortality but also increases immunopathology. Whereas transfer of very high numbers of splenocytes can clear virus in SCID mice, SJL mice typically are unable to clear Theiler's virus. Lymphocytes reactive to the major Theiler's virus epitopes are rare in SJL and other susceptible mouse strains, in contrast to resistant strains such as C57BL/10 mice (15) . The virus-specific response of only a minority of lymphocytes might partially explain why we did not observe obvious alterations in CD4 or CD8 lymphocyte infiltration by immunostaining. Another possible explanation is that a significant number of infiltrating lymphocytes or monocytes/macrophages might have been responding secondarily to tissue damage or might have had affinities for other chemokines.

A narrow window of regulation might explain why it has been difficult to associate the various aspects of Theiler's disease (e.g. susceptibility versus resistance) or multiple sclerosis (e.g. inactive versus active) with particular cytokine profiles (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) .

For example, an increase in virus concurrent with a decrease in IL-2 is consistent with the hypothesis that IL-2-expressing T h 1 lymphocytes are important for virus control.
