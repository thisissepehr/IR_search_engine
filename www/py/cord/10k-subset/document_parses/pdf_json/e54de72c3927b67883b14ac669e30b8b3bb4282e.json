            "text": "The avian origin influenza A virus (IAV) H7N9 has caused a considerable number of human infections associated with high rates of death since its emergence in 2013. As a vital component of the host innate immune system, the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing receptor, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a critical role against H1N1 viral infection. However, the function of NLRP3 inflammasome in host immunological responses to the lethal H7N9 virus is still obscure. Here, we demonstrated that mice deficient for NLRP3 inflammasome components, including NLRP3, caspase-1, and Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), were less susceptible to H7N9 viral challenge than wild type (WT) controls. Inflammasome deficiency in these animals led to significantly milder mortality and less pulmonary inflammation compared with WT mice. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor deficient mice also exhibited a higher survival rate than WT controls. Thus, our study reveals that the NLRP3 inflammasome is deleterious for the host during H7N9 infection in mice, which is due to an overwhelming inflammatory response via caspase-1 activation and associated IL-1 signal. Therefore, fine-tuning the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome or IL-1 signaling may be beneficial for the host to control H7N9 associated lethal pathogenesis.",

H7N9 exhibits low pathogenicity in birds, but has an ability to bind certain mammalian cell receptors, and replicates at temperature close to the normal body temperature of mammals [1] [2] [3] . The infected patients often develop severe symptoms, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 4 . The H7N9 infection had caused 1230 confirmed human cases, with 428 deaths by 22 February 2017 [data from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)]. The severe symptoms and high mortality associated with H7N9 infection pose a big threat to the public health. Although recent studies of H7N9 have achieved great progress, clear definition of the host immunological responses to H7N9 is still lacking 1, 5, 6 .",

A rapid antiviral response, i.e. type I interferon production, to facilitate intracellular control of viral replication; and a proinflammatory response characterized by secretion of cytokines and chemokines, which promotes recruitment of various immune cells for viral clearance 8 . As a key mediator of inflammation, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various diseases 9 . The maturation and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 require a protein Figure 1 . H7N9 RNA activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in BMDCs. (a) BMDCs were primed with 500 ng/ml LPS and transfected with different dose of H7N9 RNA for 12 hours, the supernatant were harvest and the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were measured by ELISA. (b) BMDCs from wild type and Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 , Asc \u2212/\u2212 , Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice were primed as in (a) and transfected with 0.5 ug/ml H7N9 RNA for 12 hours, supernatant were collected for ELISA as indicated. (c) Supernatants or cell lysates from H7N9 RNA-stimulated BMDCs were harvested and the expression of proteins was analysed by immunobloting. The upper lanes, marked as pellet, showed the complex called inflammasome, which activates caspase-1 to cleave proIL-1\u03b2 to its mature form 10 . More importantly, caspase-1 and the NLRP3 inflammasome have been found essential for protecting mice against H1N1 IAV infection [11] [12] [13] .",

To assess whether the NLRP3 inflammasome could be activated during H7N9 challenge, we transfected LPS-primed BMDCs (bone marrow derived dendritic cells) with H7N9 RNA and measured the production of IL-1\u03b2. As expected, robust IL-1\u03b2 secretion was detected in the H7N9 RNA-transfected samples, while the production of an inflammasome-independent cytokine TNF-\u03b1 was unaltered (Fig. 1a) , suggesting that H7N9 RNA-induced IL-1\u03b2 production was likely dependent on inflammasome activity. To ensure the role of inflammasome in H7N9 RNA-mediated induction of IL-1\u03b2, we generated BMDCs from Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 , Asc \u2212/\u2212 and Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Transfection of LPS-primed BMDCs from such mice led to significantly compromised IL-1\u03b2 secretion compared to wild type controls (Fig. 1b) . And western blotting revealed that caspase-1 activation and ASC oligomerization were also decreased in BMDCs from Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 and Asc \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1c) , which might account for the compromised IL-1\u03b2 production. Thus, our results suggest that H7N9 RNA activates caspase-1 via the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse dendritic cells.",

            "text": "It is reported that the caspase-1, activated by inflammasome, plays a critical role in murine proinflammatory responses to IAV infection 11, 12, 16 . To investigate the role of caspase-1 in H7N9 infection related inflammation, cytokines and chemokines in the supernatants of lung homogenates were analyzed (Fig. 5 ). In Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 lung tissues, the levels of IL-1\u03b2 (118.8 \u00b1 30.68 pg/g tissue) and IL-18 (1.168 \u00b1 0.3761 ng/g tissue) were significantly lower than those in WT tissues (IL-1\u03b2: 309.5 \u00b1 28.54 pg/g; IL-18: 2.856 \u00b1 0.3617 ng/g, respectively) on 7 d.p.i (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5a) . Other cytokines such as IL-12/23p40, IL-1\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b2 also exhibited decreased level in Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 lung tissues compared with WT control on either 3 d.p.i or 7 d.p.i, although the differences were not significant (Fig. 5a) . The level of IL-6 fluctuates and was lower in the lungs from Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice on 3 d.p.i, but higher on 7 d.p.i compared to WT counterparts, without significant differences in both cases (Fig. 5a) . Other cytokines such as IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17 did not show significant differences between tissues from Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 and WT mice (Fig. 5a) . As for the detected chemokines, MIP-1\u03b1 was significantly lower in Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 lung tissues than that in WT control on 3 d.p.i (P < 0.05). The levels of other chemokines, including MIP-1\u03b2, IP-10, CXCL1, CCL2 and GM-CSF were just slightly lower in the lungs of Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice than that in WT counterparts on either 3 d.p.i or 7 d.p.i. Therefore, caspase-1 was involved for an optimal production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 as well as MIP-1\u03b1 in the lung in response to H7N9 challenge. To note, the production of above mentioned cytokines and chemokines from Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed a similar pattern as that from Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5b) , indicating that deficiency of NLRP3 inflammasome genes reduced the secretion of several critical proinflammatory mediators in the lung of mice upon H7N9 IAV challenge. In addition, the production of these cytokines and chemokines in the serum of Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 , Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 and WT mice showed a similar trend with that from the lung homogenates ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). ASC and IL-1 receptor mediated signal promoted mortality and weight loss of mice after H7N9 infection. The adaptor protein ASC plays a vital role in the NLRP3 inflammasome formation, which is required for caspase-1 activation and maturation of IL-1\u03b2. The mature IL-1\u03b2 binds to IL-1 receptor 1, the functional receptor of IL-1\u03b2, induces downstream signal transduction and executes inflammatory responses. Thus, we set out to determine whether ASC and IL-1R1 play a role similar as that of NLRP3 and caspase-1 during H7N9 IAV infection. To this end, we infected Asc \u2212/\u2212 and Il1r1 \u2212/\u2212 mice with H7N9 virus and monitored their weight change and mortality daily. Our results demonstrated that the mortality of Asc \u2212/\u2212 and Il1r1 \u2212/\u2212 mice was lower compared with that of the WT mice (Fig. 6a) . The WT mice also suffered more weight loss than these knock-out animals (from 7 to 10 d.p.i) after H7N9 challenge. Of note, the difference for body weight loss between WT and Asc \u2212/\u2212 mice was statistically significant (P < 0.05) on 8 and 9 d.p.i. (Fig. 6b ).",

Significantly higher expression levels of NLRP3, RIP3, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in the lung of H7N9-infected mice were noted, indicating possible role of these molecules in driving lung pathogenesis 18 .

            "text": "Here, using the gene knockout mice we demonstrated that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was detrimental to the host upon H7N9 IAV infection. We noted that WT mice lost more body weight than Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 , Asc \u2212/\u2212 and Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 mice and their overall survival rate was lower during H7N9 infection (Figs 2 and 6) . Pathology analysis showed that there were inflammatory responses in the infected lungs of all strains of mice, both at 3 d.p.i and at 7 d.p.i; and the pulmonary inflammations at 7 d.p.i. were more severe than that at 3 d.p.i.; moreover, the pulmonary inflammations of the WT mice were stronger than Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 , Asc \u2212/\u2212 and Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Figs 3 and 7) . Flow cytometric analysis showed that inflammatory cells has started to infiltrate into the alveolar spaces in the BALF at 3 d.p.i. It seemed that CD11b + or F4/80 + (high-expressed on microphages) or CD11c + (high-expressed on dendritic cells) cells in the BALF of WT mice were significantly more than those in Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice at 3 d.p.i. There were also Ly6c + (expressed on monocytes), Ly6g + (high-expressed on neutrophils) and CD3 + (expressed on T cells) in the BALF of WT mice exhibited higher level, though it was not significant differences (Fig. 4) . However, except the CD11b + cells were retained and B220+ (expressed on B lymphocytes) cells were increased, the percentage of the most infiltrated cells were decreased in the BALF at 7 d.p.i. (Fig. 4) , which seem to be \"contrast\" to the severer pulmonary inflammation pathology observation at 7 d.p.i. (Figs 3 and 7) . . 3a) , and macrophages/dendritic cells and a few other cells started to be recruited to the infected area by chemokine MIP-1\u03b1 (Figs 4a-c and 5a) . The production of IL-1\u03b2 was still at low level at this stage (Fig. 5a) . With the development of disease, at 7 d.p.i., severe inflammation occurred in the infected lung tissue (Fig. 3b) . With the migration of the lymphocytes, especially B cells, to the inflammatory area (Fig. 4g) , the total number of infiltrated inflammatory cells were increased but the percentage of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells were decreased ( Supplementary Fig. S2, Fig. 4) . The infiltrated inflammatory cells produced large amount of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5) , which accelerated the pulmonary inflammation. From 7 d.p.i. to 14 d.p.i, the body weight of survived WT mice recovered completely, whereas Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice could not returned to the initial level (0 d.p.i) (Fig. 2d) . Microscopic analyses revealed that on 14 d.p.i, most tissues from WT mice exhibited complete recovery, while the Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 tissues still manifested strong inflammation (data not shown). Thus, WT mice suffered more due to the lung damage and inflammation in the early phase (before 7 d.p.i) of H7N9 infection and either died of organ failure, or recovered at the later phase. In contrast, Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice did not develop as strong inflammation and lung damage as seen in WT counterparts in the early phase, consequently fewer of them died. However, Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice failed to recover completely at the later phase. These results might suggest a potentially dual role for caspase-1 in H7N9 infection, detrimental role to the host upon H7N9 infection before 7 d.p.i. and possibly necessary role for recovery from the lung inflammation after 7 d.p.i. phase, likely due to a contribution to tissue regeneration. But it should be kept in mind that the comparison between 20% surviving WT and 60% surviving Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 is not justified, and more stringent experiments are needed for further explorations on the role of caspase-1 to host recovery.",

            "text": "Studies on the role of NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome during IAV infection produced conflicting results. Some studies have demonstrated that NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome is protective against H1N1 infection through viral clearance or virus induced pulmonary necrosis 11, 12 . Inflammation is essential to protect host from infection, but can also cause tissue damage or dysfunction of important organs and lead to death 21 . Dysregulation of the proinflammatory response may result in a \"cytokine storm\" that contributes to a severe viral pneumonia and serious complications in the lung 21 . The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 causes hypercytokinemia and severe tissue damage 22 . It is reported that production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6 and IP-10, is remarkably increased in H7N9 infected patients 17, 23 , and H7N9 infection associated inflammation in the lungs resulted in rapidly progressive pneumonia and development of ARDS in the majority of hospitalized patients 24, 25 . In addition, the H5N1 IAV infected patients who progressed severe lung injury have elevated levels of CCL2, IP-10, CXCL9 and IL-8 compared with the seasonal H1N1 infected patients 26 . Therefore, for the highly pathogenic influenza virus the hyperactivated proinflammatory responses may be detrimental for the host. Moreover, a recent study demonstrates that NLRP3 inflammasome plays both a protective and detrimental role during H1N1 and H3N2 infection of mice depending on the disease phase 13 . In our study, we found the inflammasome activation was deleterious in the case of H7N9 infection, possibly due to overwhelming and fatal acute inflammation in the lungs following H7N9 infection. Pathology and infiltrating cellular analyses as well as cytokine and chemokine analyses all supported this possibility (Figs 3-5) . Pathology results revealed that on 3 d.p.i, there were more inflammatory cells around the blood vessels and bronchus in WT mice compared with Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3) . The flow cytometric analyses further demonstrated the abundance of inflammatory cells in the BALF of WT mice compared to Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 counterparts (Fig. 4) , which were consistent with the observed pulmonary pathological changes.",

Although no significant difference was noted, these data indicated a possible role for the NLRP3-caspase-1 inflammasome signaling in affecting the type I interferon production. Theoretically, type I interferon response plays a role in limiting viral replication, however, we did not observe any significant difference in viral load between Casp1/11 \u2212/\u2212 or Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 versus WT mice. It is likely that the H7N9 could employ strategies to counteract the generation and function of type I interferon.",

MIP-1\u03b1 level is increased in H7N9 and H5N1 infected mice, but not in H9N2 infected animals 28 . We also noticed a clear increase of MIP-1\u03b1 in WT mice upon H7N9 infection (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, this elevation was abrogated in the early phase (3 d.p.i) in the absence of caspase-1 (Fig. 5) .

IL-1\u03b2 is a critical proinflammatory cytokine that is increased during infections with H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses 29 . IL-1\u03b2 also mediates the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils into the lung 30 . Deficiency of IL-1\u03b2 or its receptors manifests different responses to respiratory challenge with influenza virus [31] [32] [33] . Hence, the function of IL-1\u03b2 in controlling IAV infections remains obscure.

The original magnification of the top panels and the bottom panels are 200\u00d7 and 400\u00d7 (with the corresponding scale bar on the images). In the 400\u00d7 magnification, the black arrows indicate the thickening of alveolar septum and the green arrows show inflammatory cells infiltration. (c) For scoring results of pulmonary pathology of WT, Asc \u2212/\u2212 and Il1r1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, 4 slides from each mouse were monitored. 4 mice representing each genotype at specific time points were used for experiments. Data are representative of three independent infection experiments. (Fig",

The levels of cytokines and chemokines in the collected samples were determined quantitatively using a ProcartaPlex Multiplex Immunoassay kit (eBioscience, Viennna, Australia) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Flow cytometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained via flushing the lungs three times with 0.5 mL/time of PBS. The single-cell suspensions from BALF of H7N9 infected mice were first treated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody (eBioscience, Vienna, Australia) to block Fc receptor, then surface stained with antibodies against B220, CD3, CD11b, CD11c, Ly6c, Ly6g and F4/80, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before analysis with FACS Array (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The final graphical output was generated through FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).Extraction of total RNA and RT-PCR quantification. Total RNA was extracted from lung homogenates using a kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Relative Quantification of H7N9 viral load via RT-PCR was conducted as reported previously 15 . Calculation was carried out by comparing H7N9 Hemagglutinin with GAPDH, which served as an internal control GAPDH (\u0394\u0394CT method).Pathology analysis. Excised mouse lung tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by paraffin embedding and sectioning, then subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Images were collected by Leica DMI3000 microscopy with indicated magnifications.Histology scoring. Four indexes were analyzed for scoring on each slide: 1) Blood vessel region inflammation, 2) Pulmonary alveoli inflammation, 3) Lung tissue inflammation, 4) Bronchial inflammation. The detailed criteria were listed in Table 1 , which was referred to a previous report 38 ",
