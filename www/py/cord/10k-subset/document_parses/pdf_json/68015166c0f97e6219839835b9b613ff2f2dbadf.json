            "text": "Hemorrhagic shock (HS) results in the initiation of an inflammatory cascade that is critical for survival following successful resuscitation. We identified a complex sequence of molecular events including shock-dependent and reperfusion-dependent responses that offer a new comprehensive approach for consequences of HS. Shock-dependent initializing mechanisms include the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and CD14 and play a catalyzing role for subsequent phenotypic changes following resuscitation. The early immediate response genes iNOS and COX-2 promote the inflammatory response by the rapid and excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) may regulate the induction of iNOS during the ischemic phase of shock. NO is an important signaling molecule which is involved in redox-sensitive mechanisms including the downstream activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB. NO-dependent NF-\u03baB activation promotes the induction of inflammatory cytokine expression during the reperfusion phase. Peroxynitrite-mediated direct toxicity and NO-mediated inflammatory toxicity contribute to organ injury. Patients suffering consequences of severe HS are susceptible to systemic inflammation, organ injury, and mortality if physiologic and therapeutic mechanisms are ineffective in limiting the activation of the inflammatory cascade.",

The focus of this review was to delineate molecular mechanisms in the early phase of HS that promote the inflammatory response. HS can be characterized by two early phases: the shock phase followed by the post-resuscitation phase. We examined initiating mechanisms with the goal of identifying shock-and reperfusion-dependent responses [1] . The inflammatory response is defined by the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines [2] , leukocyte adhesion molecules, and infil-tration of neutrophils into tissues [3] . These changes occur in organs such as the lungs, the liver, and the gut and are likely to contribute to end organ damage and resultant dysfunction following resuscitation from shock. Our understanding of the mechanisms by which hemorrhage triggers this inflammatory response are evolving gradually. Heightened adrenergic activity [4] , tissue hypoxia, and systemic release of pro-inflammatory agents from the gut [5, 6] have been hypothesized to contribute to the activation of inflammatory pathways and to acute organ injury following hemorrhage. In addition, reactive radicals are produced and have been implicated in a number of signal transduction pathways [7] .",

Several studies have implicated endotoxin or gut-derived products in cytokine upregulation. Clinical studies have failed to identify endotoxin or bacterial translocation in human trauma victims [6] . However, recent evidence points to the lymphatics as an important route for gut-derived products [16] . Endotoxin recognition occurs primarily through interaction of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) LPS/LPS binding protein (LBP) complex with endotoxin-sensitive receptors. The expression of CD14 and Trl4 surface receptors are two key components for LPS recognition and mononuclear cell activation. We found that CD14 was upregulated during the ischemic phase of shock and that CD14 expression correlated with the severity of shock. In endotoxin-resistant (HeJ) and endotoxin-sensitive (HeN) mice as well as CD14-deficient (CD14 KO) or CD14-competent (CD14 WT) mice, the circulatory regulation and survival as well as upregulation of CD14 mRNA expression following HS was independent of the capacity to respond to LPS. Increased LBP mRNA expression was independent of Tlr4-mediated LPS recognition. IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) as markers of inflammation were increased in CD14-deficient and CD14-competent mice in HS. These results suggest that early upregulation of cytokines may be independent of the LPS recognition system CD14/ Tlr4 receptor expression (T.R. Billiar, unpublished observations).",

In a recent study, we have shown that Jun kinase (JNK) is activated in the liver within 30 min of the initiation of shock [8] . This is followed by early upregulation of inflammatory response genes during the shock or ischemic phase and these genes participate in subsequent phenotypic changes that follow resuscitation. We have demonstrated the upregulation of three genes iNOS, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and CD14 during shock. We have recently identified a clear role for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the upregulation of the inflammatory response following resuscitation [1] . As early as 30 min, iNOS mRNA can be seen in the liver and protein is evident in hepatocytes shortly thereafter. Studies using isolated liver cells have shown that iNOS expression is regulated at the level of transcription as well as mRNA stability [9] .",

Activation of PMN leads to enhanced adhesiveness of PMN to endothelium associated with release of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), and degranulation with protease release [19] . In a rodent model of unresuscitated and resuscitated HS, IL-6 and G-CSF were locally produced in the lungs. Shock and resuscitation were required to increase cytokine levels above those of sham control animals. Cytokine expression was dependent on the duration of the ischemic phase of resuscitated shock and was accompanied by signs of acute lung injury characterized by PMN infiltration, pulmonary capillary leakage, and hypoxia.

These results indicate that the presence of IL-6 or G-CSF alone can induce lung injury. A recent study using IL-6 KO mice demonstrated that IL-6 was essential for the early recruitment of PMN into the lungs and liver [25] . The reduction of PMN accumulation was associated with less pulmonary edema following resuscitation from shock. Thus, increased IL-6 and G-CSF production in the lungs of patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock may be an additional mechanism that contributes to PMNinduced lung injury and possibly ARDS.",

At present, the results indicate that basal levels of NO produced by endothelial constitutive (ec)NOS are organ protective but that increased quantities of NO generated by iNOS cause injury. Several studies have used the strategy of scavenging free radicals by administration of antioxidants during resuscitation. These studies have shown reduced organ injury and improved survival. Addition of scavengers to standard resuscitation fluids may be beneficial in removing increased amounts of free oxygen radicals during the resuscitation phase [9] .",

The early immediate response genes iNOS and COX-2 promote the inflammatory response by the rapid and excessive production of NO and prostaglandins. The transcription factor HIF-1 may regulate the induction of iNOS during the shock phase. NO-dependent NF-\u03baB activation modulates inflammatory cytokine expression during the reperfusion phase. Activated PMN are important cellular mediators of inflammation. Peroxynitrite-mediated direct toxicity and NO-mediated inflammatory toxicity contribute to organ injury.
