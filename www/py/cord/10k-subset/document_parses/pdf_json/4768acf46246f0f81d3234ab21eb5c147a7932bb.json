To investigate possible variations in species-specific cell tropism and local replication of vaccine virus, different reservoir species including foxes, raccoon dogs, raccoons, mongooses, dogs and skunks were orally immunised with a highly attenuated, high-titred GFP-expressing rabies virus (RABV). Immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR screenings revealed clear differences among species suggesting host specific limitations to ORV.

By coincidence, the red fox, the initial species for the development of the concept of oral rabies vaccination, was also the species that was highly susceptible to oral rabies vaccination; a relative low minimum effective dose was needed to elicit a protective immune response [19] [20] [21] 46 . It was only by experience from experimental and field data that other reservoir species required much higher doses to be successfully immunised by the oral route. Principally, due to the instability of the rabies virus, the gastro-intestinal tract will cause rapid antigen degradation, and hence the rabies virus vaccine must be taken up in the oral cavity for the development of an immune response 34 . However, from some of these early studies in foxes, it became clear that orally administered inactivated rabies virus vaccines did not induce protective immunity 47, 48 , indicating that vaccine virus replication within the host was essential. Hence, presently all available oral rabies vaccines are live replication-competent virus constructs.

Therefore, other tissues in the oropharyngeal cavity must have been involved in virus uptake and subsequent interaction with the immune system. Screening for viral RNA demonstrated its presence in all investigated tissues, albeit with significant differences in the positivity rates (Fig. 5) . The positivity rate for tonsils was higher for species known to be more responsive to oral vaccination as was the relative viral load (Fig. 5) corroborating findings of the immunofluorescence analyses (Figs. 1b and 2) .

Our quantitative serological results suggest a correlation with responsiveness to oral vaccination in various species for RFFIT, whereby mean VNA titres of responsive species were significantly higher (p < 0.05) as opposed to low responsive species (Table 3) .
