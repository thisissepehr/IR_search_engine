This was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-center study. Acute diarrhea was defined as three and more episodes of watery stool per day either during 48 hours or less before study entry in the patients having normal stool recently. It has been postulated that symptoms and signs of acute diarrhea have to be caused by direct infection of the gastrointestinal tract and did not associated with moderate-to-severe systemic states. 144 patients with established acute diarrhea were randomized into treatment group (enterosorbent \"carbowhite\", n = 120) or placebo group. Date collection including severity diarrhea, systemic symptoms was performed at baseline and daily during 7 days. Stool examination and serological assay were performed at baseline. The primary end points were declared as time to complete recovery from acute diarrhea. It has been found that the use of the siliceous enterosorbent (\"carbowhite\") allowed to reduce (p < 0.001) the treatment period averagely for 0.9 days (95% confidence interval 0.5-1.2 days) in comparison with placebo.

The drug does not contain sugar; it can be used in patients with diabetes 17 . Additionally, silicon dioxide promotes the movement from the internal environment of the body into the digestive tract of various toxic products, including medium molecules, oligopeptides, amines and other substances, due to concentration and osmotic gradients, followed by binding and excretion from the body 52, 53 . Therefore, there is a large body of evidence that silicon dioxide-based enterosorbents might have pleiotropic effects beyond adsorption of the intestinal products. It is been suggested that silicon dioxide may block the adhesive factors and cause denaturation of the adhesive proteins on the bacterial cell surface, disturbing the functional activity and adhesive properties of the pathogenic microorganisms 16, 17 .
