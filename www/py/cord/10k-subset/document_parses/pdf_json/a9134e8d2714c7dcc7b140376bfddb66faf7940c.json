In immunocompetent hosts their main clinical presentations are a common cold-like or flu-like syndrome and they may often be asymptomatic. Mild respiratory symptoms usually predominate. Additionally, enteroviruses are a leading cause of viral meningitis in children and myocarditis in all age groups. Enteroviruses spread from person to person. The usual mode of transmission is fecal-oral and studies of respiratory infection induced by certain types of enteroviruses in adult volunteers have shown that intranasal or aerosol administration more effectively induces respiratory infection. 7 Isolation of enteroviruses requires cellular cultures. Once identified, serotyping is cumbersome since more than 68 serotypes have been described to date and only reference laboratories can type all known serotypes. These difficulties may explain why enteroviral diagnostic techniques are unavailable on a routine basis in most microbiology laboratories and why these viruses have rarely been reported as causing infections in immunocompromised hosts. New highly sensitive PCR-based methods are being developed, but at present these diagnostic techniques are available only in research laboratories. 8 There have been few previous reports describing enterovirus infections in immunocompromised cancer patients in general and SCT recipients in particular. Two BMT recipients had an enterovirus (non-polio enterovirus in one and echovirus 11 in another) isolated from various organs in the setting of fatal pericarditis and pneumonitis. 9, 10 In a prospective study of infectious gastroenteritis in BMT recipients, a coxsackievirus was isolated in the stools of four patients, all of whom died from this complication; 11 these same investigators reported an epidemic of coxsackie A1 gastroenteritis affecting seven patients with six fatalities. 12 Surprisingly, there have been no other reports of lower gastrointestinal infections by these viruses, and in immunocompetent hosts enteroviruses do not produce gastroenteritis. There have also been only few reports of acute lower respiratory tract infections by picornaviruses in hematopoietic SCT recipients, with most cases leading to severe respiratory failure and death. However, 90% of the isolates were rhinoviruses and only 10% were due to non-polio enteroviruses. 3, 4 Some enteroviral pneumonias appear to be preceded by upper respiratory tract symptoms, but this sequence of events is not as apparent as with other community respiratory viruses such as rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses or respiratory syncytial virus. 4 As with other viral pneumonias, the exact implication of the isolation of an enterovirus from BAL and the fatal pulmonary infection is sometimes unclear, since post-mortem studies may be unavailable, show non-specific findings, or another pathogen (usually fungal or bacterial) may be identified. In our cases, however, only one patient (UPN 811) had concomitant infections which could otherwise explain the development of ARDS, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and viridans streptococci bacteremia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1571, "end": 1573, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2354, "end": 2356, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the clinical course of these four patients reflects the severity of this complication.
