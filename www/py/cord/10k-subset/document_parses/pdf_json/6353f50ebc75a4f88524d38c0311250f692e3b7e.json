During an outbreak of such a disease, the environment that the infectious agent experiences is therefore changing due to the subsequent control measures taken. In our model, we introduce a general branching process in a changing (but not random) environment. With this branching process, we estimate the probability of extinction and the expected number of infected individuals for different control measures. We also use this branching process to calculate the generating function of the number of infected individuals at any given moment. The model and methods are designed using important infections of farmed animals, such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza as motivating examples, but have a wider application, for example to emerging human infections that lead to strict quarantine of cases and suspected cases (e.g. SARS) and contact and movement restrictions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Recent outbreaks of infectious diseases of animals (e.g. classical swine fever (CSF), foot and mouth disease (FMD) and avian influenza (AI)) in Western Europe have had great impact on the economy, public life and animal health and welfare in the countries involved.

Typical for the strategies aimed at stopping outbreaks of important diseases of farm animals, is that infected herds are removed from the population by culling upon detection. A second characteristic is that due to increasing quantity and quality of the imposed control measures, the environment that the infectious agent experiences, is changing.

It is possible to use alternatives for the birth and death process to describe the spread within a herd, for example the contact process.

We assume that recovered animals with two infective neighbours are re-infected immediately. Therefore, we only consider the animals at the edge of a row of infective animals.

This makes computations much easier in this case. 3 . In the original model, the number of animals in one herd is assumed to be very large compared to the number of infected animals. Therefore, we assume that the contact rate between infected and susceptible animals is constant, and hence so is the birth rate. From data of outbreaks of CSF in the past, we can see that the number of infected animals until detection of the infection within the herd, is small compared to the total number of animals in the herd, so these assumptions seem justified in this case [11] . 4. The within-herd infection and recovery parameters \u03bb and \u00b5 can be measured experimentally or from data of past or on-going outbreaks. The parameter \u03b1 depends on the development of symptoms of infected animals and how attentive the farmers are. Therefore, in reality this \u03b1 will change at the first detection of the infection in the country (or in neighbouring countries), due to higher awareness of farmers and veterinarians. It is very difficult to estimate \u03b1 for the period before the time of the first detection. For the time after the first detection, we can estimate \u03b1 from data of past outbreaks in the same area or try to estimate this parameter during the ongoing epidemic. Using data from past outbreaks is dangerous, because the characteristics of the virus and of the farming practice may have changed. Estimation of the parameters, during an on-going outbreak is done by Meester et al. [10] . This method has some problems, e.g. the time necessary to get enough data for a reliable estimate. Another problem is that in [10] the infectivity of a herd does not depend on the \"age\" of the herd. This independence of age is essential for the estimations made. For our model it is not necessary that \u03b1 is constant in time. It is possible to extend the model and use \u03b1(t) instead of \u03b1. 5. We assume that culling is the only measure which influences the within-herd spread of the infection. Vaccination is assumed to show no effect on the spread in the herd. For CSF this assumption is justified by the fact that vaccination will lead to immunity only after two weeks. Therefore, during this first two weeks the spread of the infection is not affected by this measure. For the time after these two weeks, we assume that we can use the same speed of propagation of the infection, for computational reasons. The approximation leads to results that are conservative, that is, too pessimistic. 6.

We also use the approximation I (\u03c4 ) = H e r\u03c4 for small \u03c4 . This is not correct, but due to the small number of infective animals at small \u03c4 , the probability that the disease is detected at small \u03c4 is small too.

If the outbreak is in an advanced state, however, local depletion of susceptible herds (either by the epidemic progression or by so-called pre-emptive culling) will certainly play a role. As long as there are relatively few infected herds in a neighbourhood, (i.e. a group of herds that have contacts with each other) we assume that the infection rate does not directly depend on this number of infected herds. Measures like ring-culling (culling of all herds within a certain distance of an infected herd) and ring vaccination cannot be considered in our model. 2. We distinguish between two types of contacts, transport contacts and indirect contacts. We have assumed that the indirect contacts are the same for all herds. Transport contacts are only from multipliers to finishers. Indirect contacts include transport of the virus by wind, by visits from an infective herd to a susceptible herd etc. Transport contacts are transports of infected animals from a multiplier to a finisher. 3. We simplify the model by assuming that the measures are implemented at the time of the introduction of the virus in the population (or, in other words, that the infection is detected immediately). It would be desirable to implement the measures from the moment of first detection. It is difficult, however, to estimate parameters like \u03b1 and \u03b2 for the time before the first detection, when awareness is not yet heightened by announcement of the outbreak, and when increased hygienic measures on farms are not yet taken. If we know the value of the parameters of the model for the period between introduction and first detection, we are able to estimate the probability of extinction and the expected final size of such a situation. However, these calculations still require that we use the information from our simplified model, where measures are started directly upon introduction. 4. The function \u00b5 mm (\u03c4 ; h) is not required for our calculations of the final size and the probability of extinction. The reason why we include this function in our paper is that this function is interesting in its own right. It gives the expected offspring \u03c4 time units after an infective herd is infected itself. In practical applications, it is possible that by contact tracing some herd is suspected of being infected \u03c4 time-units ago. This \u00b5 mm (\u03c4 ; h) is then the expected number of infected multipliers by the suspected herd, if that suspected herd is a multiplier and if it is really infected. 5. The proportionality of the infection rate to the detection rate is essential in this section. Due to this property, we can find an underlying ordinary Galton-Watson process. Without this proportionality, we may ask whether it is possible to give a nice expression for the generating function. We also lose the independence of h in the generating function, which gives some computational problems. 6. Knowing the generating function of the number of infected herds at the first detection is important because if in some way it is possible to estimate parameters for the time before the first detection, we can use the distribution function of the number of infective herds at the time measures are implemented. We do not have the 'ages' of the infective herds at the first detection, but we can find a worst-case-scenario, by finding what age of a herd at t = 0 leads to the biggest offspring.

By using an iterative process, we computed this probability and size for the time the environment is still varying. By using generating functions, we can compute many important properties, like the moments of the final size, and a lower bound for the probability that the process has gone extinct after a given time. These generating functions are very useful especially if in a constant environment the expected number of infections after a certain age does not depend on that age. This only holds if the infection and detection rate are in direct proportion, for the non-varying environment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and final remarks"}, {"text": "It is difficult to estimate the parameters for the computations. Some of the properties computed in this model, like the probability of extinction heavily depend on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, describing the infection and detection rate. The model presented in this paper may be useful to compare the effect of different measures, but it is very dangerous to use this model for absolute quantitative predictions. We used the model to describe the spread of classical swine fever. It is worth investigating if the same model, with other parameters, may be used to describe the spread of other animal diseases, with culling at detection, or even human diseases, which lead to strict quarantine of detected infected individuals (and suspected cases) and contact and movement restrictions. Emerging infections such as SARS are possible examples of this.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and final remarks"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Quantification of the Effects of Control Strategies on Classical Swine Fever Epidemics", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Klinkenberg", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Everts-Van Der Wind", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["A M"], "last": "Graat", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["C M"], "last": "De Jong", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Math.
