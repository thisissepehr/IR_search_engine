Simulation is a cost-and time-effective way of predicting the evolution of the infection as the joint influence of many different factors: interaction patterns, personal characteristics, travel patterns, meteorological conditions, previous vaccination, etc. The work presented in this paper extends EpiGraph, our influenza epidemic simulator, by introducing a meteorological model as a modular component that interacts with the rest of EpiGraph's modules to refine our previous simulation results. Our goal is to estimate the effects of changes in temperature and relative humidity on the patterns of epidemic influenza based on data provided by the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS) and the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). Methods: Our meteorological model is based on the regression model developed by AB and JS, and it is tuned with influenza surveillance data obtained from SISSS. After pre-processing this data to clean it and reconstruct missing samples, we obtain new values for the reproduction number of each urban region in Spain, every 10 minutes during 2011. We simulate the propagation of the influenza by setting the date of the epidemic onset and the initial influenza-illness rates for each urban region. Results: We show that the simulation results have the same propagation shape as the weekly influenza rates as recorded by SISSS. We perform experiments for a realistic scenario based on actual meteorological data from 2010-2011, and for synthetic values assumed under simplified predicted climate change conditions. Results show that a diminishing relative humidity of 10% produces an increment of about 1.6% in the final infection rate. The effect of temperature changes on the infection spread is also noticeable, with a decrease of 1.1% per extra degree. Conclusions: Using a tool like ours could help predict the shape of developing epidemics and its peaks, and would permit to quickly run scenarios to determine the evolution of the epidemic under different conditions.

Influenza epidemics results in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness a year, which puts a high burden on health providers and results in loss of productivity and absenteeism, such as mentioned by the World Health Organization in [1] . It's been long known that in temperate climates these seasonal epidemics occur mostly in winter, and typical hypotheses assigned the blame to people being in closer proximity for longer periods of time, or lowered immune systems. In general, meteorological conditions affect virus transmission due to multiple effects: virus survival rates, host contact rates and immunity, and the transmission environment (except the case of direct or short-range contact). While these factors may have an influence, the solid evidence sustains the hypothesis that the virus's best surviving conditions are low temperatures and low absolute humidity. One of the goals of the current research in this field is to understand this relationship to be able to develop a more accurate seasonal influenza model for both temperate and tropical regions. As a motivation of this work, JT et al. [2] conclude that environment factors may become more important for a future predictive model of the effects of climate change. In a previous paper [3] , some of the authors of this paper studied the interaction of the spatio-temporal distribution of influenza in Spain and the meteorological conditions during five consecutive influenza seasons. The work uses real influenza and meteorological data in combination with statistical models to show that there is a relationship between the transmission of influenza and meteorological variables like absolute humidity and amount of rainfall.
