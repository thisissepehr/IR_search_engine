Leukotoxin has been reported to be toxic when injected into animals intravenously. Herein, we report that this lipid is not directly cytotoxic in at least two in vitro systems. Using a baculovirus expression system we demonstrate that leukotoxin is only cytotoxic in the presence of epoxide hydrolases. In addition, it is the diol metabolite that proves toxic to pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting a critical role for the diol in leukotoxin-associated respiratory disease. In vivo data also support the toxicity of leukotoxin diol. For the first time we demonstrate that soluble epoxide hydrolase can bioactivate epoxides to diols that are apparently cytotoxic. Thus leukotoxin should be regarded as a protoxin corresponding to the more toxic diol. This clearly has implications for designing new clinical interventions.",

Our surprising discovery is that the diols of leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin ( Fig. 1) are much more toxic than their progenitor epoxides (Fig. 2) . Methyllinoleate was not toxic to any of the transfected Sf-21 cells (Fig. 2a) . Methyl leukotoxin was not toxic to control cells expressing ~-galactosidase (lacZ). This epoxy fatty acid exhibited toxicity only when incubated with cells expressing human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), mouse soluble epoxide hydrolase (msEH), or human microsomal epoxide hydrolase (hmEH). This links epoxide hydrolysis to cytotoxicity (Fig. 2 , b and c). As with other plants and animals studied, the human soluble epoxide hydrolase hydrolyzes most fatty acid epoxides at more than 1000 times the rate of the microsomal epoxide hydrolase\". Thus, it is not surprising that cells transfected with the virus cod- Leul<oloxln (cls-8,10-Epoxyoctadec-8(2)-enolc Acid) Fig. 1 Linoleic acid is an 18:2 polyunsaturated lipid, which is a very abundant fatty acid in the average American diet. It can be converted by autooxidation or P-450 action to two epoxides commonly known as leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin. Either acid catalyzed hydrolysis or exposure to epoxide hydrolase leads to the corresponding threo diols, which we hypothesize to be responsible for at least some of the toxic effects previously attributed to the epoxides. ing the soluble enzyme are more sensitive to the leukotoxins than those transfected with virus coding the microsomal enzyme. Methyl leukotoxin diol, however, was toxic to all the cells mentioned above (Fig. 2b ) as was its free acid\". We observed similar results for isoleukotoxin and its corresponding diol with all the above-mentioned transfected cells (Fig. 2 , d and e). The diols were of similar toxicity, and the epoxides were nontoxic in HeLa cells. These data suggest that leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin are protoxins. In the systems studied here, they are only toxic following activation to the corresponding diols. The low toxicity of the linoleate diepoxides and lack of toxicity of their hydration products (data not shown) suggests that further epoxidation of the leukotoxin diols is not needed for cytotoxicity, unlike the case with the diol epoxides of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 16",

No diol was detected in cells expressing lacZ, but approximately 60% of the radioactivity in the cells expressing hsEH was attributable to the diol 16 to 24 hours after dosing. The diols and epoxides clearly have differences in polarity and thus differences in their anticipated rate of crossing biological membranes. Calculation of log P values (octanol/water partition coefficients) for these compounds indicates that all of the compounds will partition preferentially into cells; however, one can anticipate that the epoxides will partition more rapidly than the diols with log P of 6.048 for methyl leukotoxin and methyl isoleukotoxin, 5.632 for leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin, log P of 4.601 for methylleuko- z200 j.lM) to all cells, showing that the hydrolysis of the epoxides of methyl leukotoxin and methyl isoleukotoxin to their diols causes the toxicity attributed to these compounds. On the basis of studies of uptake and metabolism of \"C leukotoxin, the lethal concentration of leukotoxin diol or isoleukotoxin diol produced by cells expressing hsEH is slightly lower than the .lethal concentration of exogenous diol (data not shown). All experiments were replicated three to seven times on differ- Hours after exposure Hours after exposure indicating an increase in intercellular junction permeability and/or loss of epithelial integrity. Both of the dials apparently reduced net ion flux in alveolar epithelial monolayers, suggesting that the mechanism of toxicity differed from that following oxidant gas exposure' 0 \u2022 Both of these effects (decreased active ion transport, elevated paracellular permeability) would contribute to the development of leukotoxin-induced alveolar edema previously reported following in vivo exposures\". As shown in Fig. 3 , there is no statistically significant difference between methyl linoleate, its monoepoxides leukotoxin and isoleukotoxin, and a variety of other oxidized lipids in this system. Although not significant by simple statistics, the leukotoxins do seem to show a trend toward toxicity in Fig. 3a . If real, these effects could be due to traces of diol formed from the epoxide, alternate metabolites formed from the epoxide, or from direct action of the epoxide itself. Our preliminary results show that the dials, but not the methyl linoleate or its monoepoxides, also increase intracellular levels of calcium. The in vitro observations on the relative toxicity of the leukotoxins and their diols were borne out in vivo. In both Sprague-Dawley rats and Swiss-Webster mice the leukotoxin dials proved to be more toxic and to cause much more pronounced symptoms at a lower concentration than the parent leukotoxins. The leukotoxin dial concentrations showing biological activity in vitro are toxin dial and methyl isoleukotoxin dial, and log P of 4.18 for leukotoxin dial and isoleukotoxin diol. Both of these arguments support the concept that the epoxides are protoxins for the diol or subsequent metabolite, but they do not directly address subtle differences in potency between leukotoxin, isoleukotoxin and their diols.",

Methyl leukotoxin and methyl isoleukotoxin, and their diols were chemically synthesized from methyl linoleate using mchloroperbenzoic acid, as described previously'\u00b7\". These two monoepoxides and the diastereomers of the 9,10-12, 13-diepoxide (not shown) were separated from each other and interfering compounds using normal-phase silica column chromatography. Each of these monoepoxides then was hydrolyzed to its diol using perchloric acid and purified. The purity and identity of all compounds were confirmed using a combination of at least TLC, GC, GC/LREI/MS, and 'H and \"C NMR and comparisons of these data to those found in the literature\". Free fatty acids were purified using the same solvent system containing 1% acetic acid.",

The compound was added as described above to give a final concentration of 220 ~M. Aliquots from various times were extracted with ethyl ether, mixed with authentic standards, concentrated, and spotted on 250m silica TLC plates.

Briefly, lungs from male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were filled with an emulsion of Fluorinert FC-75 (3M, St. Paul, MN) and bovine serum albumin in balanced salt solution for 20 min at 37 oc. After displacement of the emulsion by lavage, a solution of elastase (Worthington Biochemical, Freehold, NJ) was infused via the airways and allowed to incubate for 20 min at 37 oc. Elastase-digested lungs were minced, filtered and pooled to yield a single-cell suspension, which was centrifuged on a discontinuous Percoll (Pharmacia) gradient. Blood-borne leukocytes were subsequently removed from this enriched cell suspension using lgG-coated plates, resulting in a final yield of -85% type II cells. Isolated type II cells were plated onto tissue culture-treated Transwell inserts (Costar, Van Nuys, CA) in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum and 0.1 ~M dexamethasone. After 48 h in culture at 37 oc in 5% CO,/air, the initial medium was removed from the cultures and replaced with serum-free F-12 + 6 nutrient medium as previously described\". This serum-free medium consisted of Ham's F-12 supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (14 mM), N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N' -2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, 10 mM) and L-cystine (0.15 mM) and contained the following growth factors: insulin (5 ~g/ml), transferrin (5 ~g/ml), epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (1 ~M), bovine hypothalamus extract (7.5 ~g/ml) and retinol (0.1 ~M). Monolayers were then incubated in serum-free medium for an additional 24 to 48 h until removed from the incubator for experiments.",

Rats were anesthetized and laid on their backs. Their abdomens were punctured vertically after placing the tip of the syringe needle on the right side of the zyphoid process and below the last rib. Next, the syringe was rotated downwards 45 degrees and rotated clockwise 45 degrees. At this point, the syringe was pushed forward to puncture the diaphragm and the heart. This would place the tip of the needle into the right side of the heart. To ensure dispensing of the test material into the circulation, blood was withdrawn into the syringe before releasing the test material. Male Swiss-Webster mice (18-20 g) from Bantin-Kingman (Fremont, CA) received tail vein injections of free fatty acids dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol after they were anesthetized by inhaling methoxyflurane.",

Data are presented as means\u00b1 s.d.; n = 5-10 monolayers. *Mean significantly less than that of the parent lipid (methyllinoleate) at the same time after exposure as determined by one-way ANOVA/Scheffe contrast. Monolayers were treated with 300 JlM methyl linoleate (D), methyl leukotoxin (.A.), methyl isoleukotoxin (e), methyl leukotoxin diol (L:.) or methyl isoleukotoxin diol (0), delivered in less than 2% methanol (vol/vol). Immediately before exposure (0 h) and at various times after administration of lipid, monolayer bioelectric properties [transepithelial resistance (R,), short-circuit current (/.,)] were recorded using a voltohmmeter as previously described\". a, Treatment of monolayers with 300 JlM methyl leukotoxin diol or methyl isoleukotoxin diol resulted in decreased 1., by 5 h following exposure, suggestive of reduced net transepithelial ion transport. Complete absence of 1,, 24 h following exposure indicated the loss of epithelial cell viability. b, R, values of same monolayers shown in a. Decreased R, was noted at 5 h following exposure to 300 JlM methyl isoleukotoxin, indicating that paracellular permeability increased as a result of lipid administration. By 24 h after exposure to either methyl leukotoxin diol or methyl isoleukotoxin diol, R, values were negligible, confirming a decrease in cell viability and monolayer integrity as a result of treatment with either diol. No biological activity was observed in this system with the parent compound, monoepoxides(s), or diol(s) in the methyl oleate series. In separate experiments only methyl leukotoxin diol and methyl isoleukotoxin diol were effective at increasing intracellular calcium monitored by Fura-2 with 50 JlM the lowest effective dose in alveolar epithelial cells, whereas the other compounds were inactive at doses up to 300 JlM (data not shown).",
