The UreB-producing strains were then administered orally to mice, and the immune response to UreB was examined. Orally vaccinated mice produced a significant UreB-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response. Specific anti-UreB IgA responses could be detected in the feces of mice immunized with the secreting lactococcal strain. Mice vaccinated orally were significantly protected against gastric Helicobacter infection following a challenge with H. pylori strain SS1.

The standard treatment for H. pylori infections has depended on antibiotics in combination with proton pump inhibitors (Bazzoli et al., 2002) . Antibiotic-based triple therapies are, however, not practical for global control due to the high cost, patients' noncompliance and low effectiveness due to the development of antibiotic resistance among strains of H. pylori (Telford & Ghiara, 1996; Michetti, 1997) . Vaccination against H. pylori is therefore one of the most effective ways to control H. pylori infection and, indeed, administration of oral bacterial antigens can protect mice against H. pylori infection (Ferrero et al., 1994; Marchetti et al., 1998; Kotloff et al., 2001; Nystr\u00f6m & Svennerholm, 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 128, "text": "(Warren & Marshall, 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 447, "end": 469, "text": "(Bazzoli et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 696, "end": 720, "text": "(Telford & Ghiara, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 721, "end": 736, "text": "Michetti, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 944, "end": 966, "text": "(Ferrero et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 967, "end": 990, "text": "Marchetti et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 991, "end": 1012, "text": "Kotloff et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1041, "text": "Nystr\u00f6m & Svennerholm, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Helicobacter pylori synthesizes a urease to buffer the pH of its immediate surroundings within the stomach. The role of urease in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated diseases is not limited to colonization as ammonia produced by the urease enters the H. pylori nitrogen metabolism and is eventually incorporated into proteins (Williams et al., 1996) . Urease might also help to recruit neutrophils and monocytes in the inflamed mucosa and to activate production of proinflammatory cytokines (Harris et al., 1996) . Moreover, urease (including subunit proteins UreA and UreB) is one of the main antigens recognized by the human immune response to H. pylori, and UreB seems to be more protective than UreA (Ferrero et al., 1994) . Urease has been used in vaccination trials to prevent infection with H. pylori in mice (Del Giudice et al., 2001) . Both oral and systemic immunizations were considered. The use of oral routes for immunization against infective diseases is desirable because oral vaccines are easier to administer and have higher compliance rates, and mucosal surfaces are the portals of entry for many pathogenic microbial agents. To render the vaccine effective, oral immunization requires the use of mucosal adjuvants, such as the cholera toxin or Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). However, these are used only in animal models because of their toxicity.

Lactococcus lactis has been described previously as an effective mucosal antigen-delivery system. Mucosal vaccination with recombinant L. lactis strains expressing CRR-produced CRR-specific salivary IgA and serum IgG, prevented pharyngeal infection with Streptococcus pyogenes and promoted survival (Mannam et al., 2004) .

The present study shows that L. lactis has the potential to act as an effective mucosal delivery system for UreB. The plasmids used for secretory expression of UreB in this system provide a useful model for exploring the characteristics of this vaccine delivery system.
