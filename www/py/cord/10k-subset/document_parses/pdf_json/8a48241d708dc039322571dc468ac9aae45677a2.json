Typical examples of such a pathogen are influenzatype viruses. We allow for time-varying infectivity levels among individuals, and model the probability of infection per contact as a function of the clinical signals. In order to accomplish this, we introduce a modified chain-binomial Reed-Frost model. We obtain an expression for the basic reproduction ratio and determine conditions which guarantee that the epidemic does not survive in the long-term. These conditions being functions of the signal's distribution, they can be used to design and evaluate interventions, such as treatment protocols.",

If we represent by p the probability of a contact between a susceptible and an infected individual resulting in a new case, we have that, at time t, the probability that a susceptible individual does become infected, c t , is equal to the probability of at least one infectious contact, i.e.,",

Infectivity levels may also vary according to similar factors. Indeed, the capacity of an infected individual to produce an infectious contact may depend upon the set of signals developed.

Our main objective with the evaluation of R 0 and related functions is to define criteria yielding clues as to the long-term disease establishment. While the expected value gives some clues, it is also important to evaluate how likely the value of R 0 is to spread around it. The traditional statistical approach is to construct a confidence interval for R 0 , and check if the value contains those leading to long-term disease establishment, in this case any value greater than, or equal to, 1. In our problem, however, this is of limited use: R 0 being a random variable assuming only nonnegative integer values 0, 1, 2, . . . , all of these values have positive probability mass and, thus, any confidence interval is likely to include the value R 0 = 1 at least. A more useful measurement seems to be the probability that R 0 \u2265 1. While taking uncertainty into account, this is perhaps more useful: if, under certain conditions, it is known that the probability that R 0 \u2265 1 is about 20%, then only 1 in 5 independent initial cases are likely to propagate the disease.",

For, on the one hand, there are several infections, like influenza, which, besides being transmitted among small groups of individuals, produce highly heterogeneous clinical pictures. On the other hand, the huge amount of genetic information provided by the emerging field of genomics (and proteomics) generates clinical information which may sharply distinguish individuals.
