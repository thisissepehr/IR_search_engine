The major routes of entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment are industries, hospitals, or direct disposal of unwanted or expired drugs made by the patient. The most important and distinct features of pharmaceuticals are that they are deliberately designed to have an explicit mode of action and designed to exert an effect on humans and other living systems. This distinctive feature makes pharmaceuticals and their metabolites different from other chemicals, and this necessitates the evaluation of the direct effects of pharmaceuticals in various environmental compartments as well as to living systems. In this background, the alarming situation of ecotoxicity of diverse pharmaceuticals have forced government and nongovernment regulatory authorities to recommend the application of in silico methods to provide quick information about the risk assessment and fate properties of pharmaceuticals as well as their ecological and indirect human health effects. This chapter aims to offer information regarding occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, their persistence, environmental fate, and toxicity as well as application of in silico methods to provide information about the basic risk management and fate prediction of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Brief ideas about toxicity endpoints, available ecotoxicity databases, and expert systems employed for rapid toxicity predictions of ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals are also discussed.",

The primary routes of entrance of pharmaceuticals into the environment are domestic, hospital, and industrial wastes [ 2 ] . Pharmaceuticals are excreted in urine or feces as a mixture of unchanged chemicals and metabolites and enter into the environment through septic tank and sewage systems [ 1 ] . On the other hand, ecotoxicity data of pharmaceuticals are available in the literature for less than 1 % of the drugs, and only a small number of pharmaceuticals and their residues have been subjected to risk assessment employing ecotoxicological tests.",

As a consequence, when pharmaceuticals and their unaltered metabolites enter into the environment by different means, they can affect humans as well as other living species. There are many drugs whose specifi c effects or modes of action are not well known, and they often produce effects through several modes of action. These distinguished features make pharmaceuticals dissimilar from others and this is the sole reason to assess the potential acute and chronic effects of pharmaceuticals in diverse environmental compartments. It is quite apparent that the toxic effects of pharmaceuticals on diverse organisms in aquatic as well as nonaquatic environment are due to their long persistent and bio-accumulative nature [ 4 ] . In view of the serious issue of pharmaceutical toxicity to the environment, it is vital to categorize the proper source, occurrence, effects, and fate of each individual pharmaceutical product as well as to perform the risk assessment and risk management of ecotoxicological effects of the pharmaceutical chemicals and their metabolites [ 1 , 2 ] .",

The world consumption of antibiotics has risen radically in the last decade, also increasing the elimination of their metabolites in their original form. Most antibiotics are poorly metabolized after ingestion, probably resulting in a fraction of antibiotics from 25 to 75 % leaving the bodies in an unaltered form after consumption [ 5 ] . Additionally, a high percentage of the antibiotics added to the animal feed are excreted in urine or manure. In some cases, as much as 90 % of the antibiotic administered orally may pass through the animal unchanged and excreted in urine and manure. Thereafter, these antibiotics can enter surface and groundwater and be strongly adsorbed in soils and are not readily degradable [ 6 ] . Vidaver [ 7 ] estimates that 53,000 ha of fruit and vegetable plants are sprayed annually with antibiotics. For example, streptomycin and oxytetracycline are registered by the US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) for use in plant agriculture. Utilization of transgenic plants to produce inexpensive antibiotics may also be a cause of environmental hazards due to the existence of crop residues, roots, and root exudates in the soil which can act as a continuous source of residual antibiotics to soil fauna and fl ora [ 8 ] .",

According to a nationwide study of \"emerging pollutants\" in waters, the US Geological Survey (USGS) tested for pharmaceuticals in 139 rivers in 30 states of the USA, detecting diverse therapeutic classes of biologically active compounds [ 10 ] . The cardiovascular drug propranolol has been reported downstream from the sewage treatment plant [ 11 ] . The antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and clofi brate are two most persistent pharmaceuticals which have been detected in the environment [ 2 ] . Major detected drugs in rivers were beta blockers (e.g., metoprolol up to 1.54 \u03bcg/l) and betasympathomimetics, estrogens (e.g., 17\u03b2-estradiol up to 0.013 \u03bcg/l) [ 12 ] , analgesic and anti-infl ammatory drugs (e.g., Diclofenac up to 1.2 \u03bcg/l) [ 13 ] , and also antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin up to 1.7 \u03bcg/l) [ 12 ] , as well as lipid-lowering agents (e.g., clofi brinic acid up to 0.2 \u03bcg/l) [ 14 ] and antiepileptic drugs (e.g., carbamazepine up to 2.1 \u03bcg/l) [ 13 ] . Presence of clofi bric acid, propylphenazone, and diclofenac has been reported in the drinking water of Berlin in the concentration range of several hundreds of nanograms per liter [ 15 ] . Paracetamol, diclofenac, and carbamazepine were monitored in drinking water in Southern France [ 16 ] , and clofi bric acid and diazepams were detected in treated drinking water in Milan, Italy [ 17 ] . Psychoactive and illicit drugs amphetamine, cocaine and its metabolite benzoylecgonine, morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, methadone and its main metabolite 2-ethylidene-1,5dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine have been detected in surface and waste waters [ 18 ] . Schultz and Furlong found highest concentrations of antidepressant drugs venlafaxine, citalopram, and bupropion 1000 \u00b1 400 ng/l, 90 \u00b1 20 ng/l, and 60 \u00b1 40 ng/l, respectively, in samples collected downstream from a water reclamation plant [ 19 ] .

According to the US FDA guidelines for the risk assessments of human drugs, applicants have to provide an environmental assessment report when the expected concentration of the active pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is \u22651 \u03bcg/l [ 29 ] . Additionally, the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) issued a guidance document \" Guidance for Industry for the Submission of an Environmental Assessment in Human Drug Application and Supplements \" in 1995 [ 30 ] . In case of veterinary medicines, environmental risk assessments have been required in the USA since about 1980 and Europe since 1997 [ 31 ] .",

Computer-aided toxicity models allow for the effects of pharmaceuticals (physicochemical properties, toxicological activity, distribution, fate, etc.) to be easily predicted. These predictions may be obtained from the knowledge of chemical structure alone, provided that the structure can be described in two or three dimensions. Employing these methods, ecotoxicity information on pharmaceuticals may be obtained without toxicity testing, and/or even before synthesis of the compound. Therefore, use of QSAR as one of the non-experimental methods is signifi cant in order to lessen time, animal usage and cost involvement in design, development, and discovery process of drugs and/or pharmaceuticals.",

Organisms like bacteria, fungi, and microalgae are primarily affected as antibiotics are designed to inhibit the microorganisms. Antibiotics have the potential to affect the microorganisms in sewage systems and waste water treatment plant too. The inhibition of wastewater bacteria may seriously affect organic matter degradation and nitrifi cation process which is a vital step in wastewater purifi cation and elimination of toxic ammonia [ 77 ] . Lincomycin showed signifi cant inhibition of the nitrifi cation activity [ 78 ] . Ciprofl oxacin was found to be active against Vibrio fi scheri at a concentration of 5 mg/l [ 79 ] . Thomulka and McGee [ 80 ] have performed two bioassays to evaluate the toxicity of antibiotics like novobiocin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, and streptomycin to Vibrio harveyi, and approximately no toxic effects were identifi ed after short incubation times where the employed endpoint was luminescence. Common receptors have been identifi ed in plants for a number of antibiotics affecting transcription and translation (tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, aminoglycosides, and pleuromutilins), metabolic pathways such as folate biosynthesis (sulfonamides), chloroplast replication (fl uoroquinolones), and fatty acid biosynthesis (triclosan) [ 81 ] . Antimicrobials can affect the degradation of organic matter in large extent as well as have effects upon sediment's microbial community [ 82 ] . Strong inhibitory effects on several bacteria and diminution in the length of the hyphae of lively molds in forest soil have been observed when antibiotics are added in concentrations of 10 mg/kg soil. A transitory effect on sulfate reduction was detected when antibiotics were mixed to sediment [ 83 ] . Allergic risks may arise from the high exposure of antibiotics dust particle in the air. Tylosin and sulfamethazine, which occurred in 80 % and 65 % of the samples respectively, are drugs with known allergic potential. Therefore, the high incidence of the asthma disease occurred among children living on farms. A survey on dust in pig fattening buildings in Europe exposed an average concentration of inhalable airborne dust of 2.2 mg/m 3 [ 84 ] . Chloramphenicol is extensively employed in farming resulting in severe hazardous effects including myelosuppression to farmers; that is why it was totally banned for food-producing animals within the EU and the USA in 1994 [ 85 ] .",

On the contrary, the techniques combating resistance are diminishing in power and number. Antibiotics in sub-inhibitory concentrations can have an infl uence on cell Cleuvers [ 45 ] evaluated that acute toxicities of NSAIDs were relatively low, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values obtained using Daphnia in the range from 68 to 166 mg/l and from 72 to 626 mg/l in the algal test. With EC 50 values of 23.6 mg/l (ibuprofen), 23.8 mg/l (diclofenac), and 38.2 mg/l (naproxen), chronic ecotoxicity was somewhat higher, but still the values are far above the concentrations detected in surface water. A prominent confi rmation of diclofenac residues in dead cattle has been observed in Pakistan [ 87 ] . Only in Germany, in 2002, 93.5 million prescriptions for NSAIDs were made with a transaction volume of about 1562 million Euros [ 88 ]. Due to higher usage and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, analgesics and anti-infl ammatory drugs can reach considerable (up to >1 \u03bcg/l) concentrations in the environment. Few NSAIDs are detected in very low doses even in drinking water. Reports suggested the presence a concerning amount of diclofenac and ibuprofen in Swiss lakes and rivers, as well as in water bodies from the UK, Spain, Brazil, Greece, and the USA [ 15 ] .",

On the contrary, in same place, concentrations of these drugs in soil were considerably lower up to 0.046 mg/kg [ 116 ] . In a study performed in Slovenia, it was found that high concentrations of abamectin and doramectin were found in feces (0.2-0.8 mg/kg and 0.4-1.2 mg/kg, respectively) during the fi rst 20 days after treatment, reaching concentrations of about 0.2 mg/ kg after 70 and 50 days, respectively [ 117 ] . Gr\u00f8nvold et al. [ 118 ] found that ivermectin and fenbendazole affect the survival of the nematode Pristionchus maupasi at concentrations higher than 3 mg dung/kg (w/w) and 10-20 mg dung/kg, respectively. Svendsen et al. [ 119 ] showed that ivermectin and the fenbendazole did not affect earthworms. However, the disappearance of dung was affected by the avermectin but not by the fenbendazole. . Tamifl u tablet largely dominated Relenza (disk inhaler) due to its relative ease of administration. Tamifl u is a prodrug, which is converted to the active drug oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) in the liver. About 80 % of an oral dose of Tamifl u is excreted as OC in the urine and the remaining portions are excreted as OP in the feces. Therefore, both the parent chemical and its bioactive metabolite eventually are projected to reach a mean of 2-12 mg/l in WWTPs during a moderate and severe pandemic [ 122 ] . Current evidences suggested that rivers receiving WWTP effl uent would also be exposed to OC throughout a pandemic. The OC concentrations between 293 and 480 ng/l have been recorded in rivers receiving WWTP effl uent during the 2009 pandemic [ 123 ] .",

Industrial sectors should have the major role to treat the failed active pharmaceutical under quality control category properly before it reach to the environment. Additionally, each pharmaceutical product should consist of materials safety data sheet (MSDS) intended to provide workers and emergency personnel with procedures for handling or working with that substance in a safe manner, information such as physical data, toxicity, health effects, fi rst aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, and spill-handling procedures.

The principles of green chemistry state that the functionality of a chemical should not only comprise the properties of a chemical essential for its application, but also quick and trouble free degradability after its usage. Improvement of synthesis and renewable feedstock are very important issues for preparation of environment friendly pharmaceuticals. Employing these principles and the awareness of green chemistry to pharmaceuticals are necessary [ 138 ] . In this perspective, a system called \"benign by design\" can be considered which means easy degradability after application is considered even before a pharmaceutical's synthesis. This approach is not completely new. For instance, it is a general practice during the development of pharmaceuticals that adverse side effects are to be taken into consideration. This can also result in economic rewards in the long run and will fi t into green pharmacy [ 170 ] . But one has to note that a pharmaceutical may also lose its specifi c therapeutic action due to the structural modifi cation while introducing green chemistry. However, this approach can be employed at least for the optimized and new synthesis routes [ 170 ] . Again, it is true that fi nding good lead compounds is a major task even without considering the environment toxicity issue. However, there is no requirement to fi nd a new lead compound at fi rst. The modifi cation of known lead structures can be the best option to do. Responding to the green and justifi able pharmacy challenge may also result in new marketing opportunities with help of appropriate and scientifi c research within industry and academia.",

The skin metabolism simulator mimics metabolism using 2D structural information. The covalent reactions with proteins are described by 47 alerting groups. human health and environment stability. Additionally, their specifi c modes of action and specific effects on living systems make pharmaceuticals distinctly different from other chemicals. This sole feature is suffi cient reason to assess the potential effects of pharmaceuticals in diverse environmental compartments. The problem is more horrifying as the occurrence level of pharmaceuticals in different environmental compartments is largely varied. The variations in drug occurrences from country to country and also within the different regions of a country make the assessment of pharmaceuticals a troublesome job for the environmental scientist. The interactions between pharmaceuticals and natural stressors of aquatic and terrestrial communities remain to be unexplained. Along with that, the proper risk assessment of mixtures of pharmaceutical products is another area where more introspection is required in present times. In this book chapter, the hazardous effects of the most common therapeutic classes of pharmaceutical to the living ecosystems and environment are discussed. Furthermore, specifi c information on the sources, fate, and effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment and their possible negative impact on different ecosystems are explored. There is a lack of suffi cient information and scientifi c data on effects of long-term exposure to nontarget organisms. It is also important to assess the presence of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites and transformation products in several environmental compartments. One can fi nd only a few reports on the quantitative effects of pharmaceuticals, but the effects of metabolites are not suffi ciently explored by the scientifi c community. One has to accept that the identifi cation of risk assessment and management are not suffi cient if they are not properly implemented in right way. In these perspectives, the major role should be played by government authorities and agencies by implementing various guidelines and rules for the reduction of toxicity of pharmaceuticals to the environment.",

Hence, a suffi cient number of models should be developed to address the risk assessment and risk management in an effi cient way by minimizing the requirement of time, animal testing and cost. This will also help in gathering the ecotoxicity data as soon as a new pharmaceutical product comes to the market.

Along with it, in 1995, the FDA-CDER issued a new guidance document for the Submission of an Environmental Assessment in Human drugs. In the same year, the US FDA initiated a retrospective review on ecotoxicity data submitted in environmental assessments over the preceding decade.

A range of state, territory and Commonwealth government agencies share regulatory responsibility for chemical safety in Australia, with each chemical being regulated according to its use, whether as a pharmaceuticals, veterinary medicine, pesticide, food additive or industrial chemical. The major responsibility of NICNAS are: \u2022 Assessing new industrial chemicals for human health and/or environmental effects \u2022 Maintaining the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances (AICS) \u2022 Circulation of information on the human health and environmental impacts of chemicals and recommending on Medicines Act provides that the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) is responsible for the environmental risk assessment. The UBA started assessing the environmental impact of veterinary and human pharmaceuticals in an authorization routine in 1998 and 2003, respectively. The UBA already assessed around 180 veterinary and around 240 human pharmaceutical formulations. Filtering concepts established between UBA and the authorization agency responsible for veterinary medicines focused the ERA on antibiotics, parasiticidal substances and analgesics. Cytostatic medicines, hormones and contrast agents dominated the human medicine dossiers assessed by UBA. is an authorized regulatory body which was initiated in 2005 by the Swedish Association for the Pharmaceutical Industry. The rationale of the classifi cation system is to offer the public and health care sectors with environmental information about all active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) on the Swedish market up to till date. In 2004, the Swedish Medical Product Agency (MPA) concluded in a report to the Swedish government that there is a lack of environmental toxicity data for the majority of the APIs available on the Swedish market. To improve risk management decision making, suffi cient knowledge about environmental exposures and effects in nontarget species for all relevant pharmaceutical substances is needed. Within SECIS, the pharmaceutical companies provide environmental data and classify their products according to predefi ned criteria and a guidance document. The guidance document is developed for the purposes of SECIS, but it is based on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline for environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and the European Commission Technical Guidance Document (TGD).",

Acute toxicity of methotrexate is reported on highly proliferative species like the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis [EC 50 (48 h) = 45 mg/l] [ 104 ]. On the contrary, cyclophosphamide appears to have a little effect on them. Methotrexate has been shown to have no or little effect on certain protozoans including Toxoplasma gondii , Babesia bovis , and Leishmania tropica, perhaps as they have different mechanisms of drug metabolism [ 105 ]. Development and growth of helminths in both mammalian and bird hosts were detrimentally effected by methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. Abnormal teratogenicity was noticed in fi sh embryos at higher concentrations [EC 50 (48 h) = 85 mg/l]. Biomphalaria glabrata , a freshwater snail is largely affected with the long-term exposure to methotrexate [ 106 ]. Doxorubicin, tamoxifen, and methotrexate have all been reported as effective parasiticide agents against many protozoan species [ 107 ].A very limited number of studies on the effects of neurological agents on host-parasite dynamics have been studied, despite phenothiazine has been used as a parasiticide for long time[ 108 ].
