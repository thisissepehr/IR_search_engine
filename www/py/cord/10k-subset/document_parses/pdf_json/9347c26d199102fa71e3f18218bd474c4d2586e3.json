We are very grateful for their continued support, without which the meeting would not be possible. We present the case of an 18-year-old gentleman who had an inflammatory neuropathy secondary to a thymoma. He underwent a VATS thymectomy, the first case in Ireland. The surgery involved a 3 cm transverse incision above the supra-sternal notch, partial mobilization of the thymus, and 2-port placement with full thymic mobilization and excision. The advantages of a VATS approach include lower blood loss (125 vs. 186 mls), lower post-operative ventilation rates (4.2 vs. 16.2 %), shorter lengths of hospitalisation (5.6 vs. 8.1 days), and improved cosmesis. The patient made an excellent recovery, discharged to home on post-operative day 4. We report a case of pleural giant B cell lymphoma in a 69 year old man induced by immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite adequate control of his RA with anti-TNF treatment, this was substituted with leflunomide and prednisolone after a myocardial infarction. He subsequently developed recurrent bloody exudative pleural effusions containing a lymphomatous cell population. Prolonged remission was obtained with the anti CD20 antibody therapy, rituximab. Although the attribution of lymphoma with anti-TNF therapy and immunosuppressive treatment remains controversial [1] [2] , the association is more than spurious [3] . Despite a low risk of lymphoma from biological therapies, continued vigilance is warranted. Pericardial atresia is a rare cardiothoracic malformation. It is mostly diagnosed incidentally, on surgery, or autopsy. It usually has benign symptoms, but herniation of the heart through a partial defect can be fatal. We describe an unusual case of 54 years old Zimbabwean lady who presented with severe headache, syncope, bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension. She was also noted to have elevated D-dimers and was hypoxic on room air. A chest X-ray reported cardiomegaly. A CT pulmonary angiogram demonstrated no embolism, but did show features consistent with absence of the pericardium. Further cardiac MRI confirmed this finding in addition to left ward rotation of heart into left thoracic cavity and four chamber dilatation. A review of the available literature on clinical presentation, diagnostic assessment and therapeutic options is presented.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1434, "end": 1437, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1441, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1482, "end": 1485, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Welcome from the Local Organiser"}, {"text": "and soft tissue, including primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs).

Imaging confirmed 5.4 9 4.3 cm mixed solid and cystic mass in right lung apex invading into supraclavicular muscles and neural foramen. The biopsy and immunotyping revealed small round ''blue cells'' soft tissue tumour equivalent of EES/PNET. She had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of the tumour with a good result and further planned to continue chemotherapy and evaluate treatment response. A 42 year old man with known Kartagener's associated bronchiectasis presented with increased cough and sputum production associated with pyrexia. Radiologically, he had a right lower lobe infiltrate but sputum culture and urinary legionella antigen were negative. However, he failed to improve on a penicillin. Bronchoscopy was performed and lavage specimens grew legionella pneumophila serogroup 3. He recovered following treatment with levofloxacin. There was no history of foreign travel but he did sleep in a camper van. There are 15 known subgroups of Legionella pneumophila and only serogroup 1 is detected by urinary antigen. Culture remains the gold standard. A 41 year old lady was referred to the haematology service with a relapse of follicular lymphoma grade 3A. Following salvage chemotherapy and pre transplant conditioning with alemtuzumab, she had a non myeloablative allogenic stem cell transplant. As part of the investigation for recurrent lower respiratory tract infections a bronchoscopy revealed a large exophytic tumour occluding the anterior orifice of the left upper lobe. Biopsy and culture confirmed mycobacterium Kansasii. The patient had an excellent clinical, microbiological and radiological response to treatment with resolution of the tumour at bronchoscopy. Our case demonstrates an unusual presentation of mycobacterium kansasii. Atypical mycobacterial infections although rare must be considered in this patient group. A 35-year-old woman presented in symptomatic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Proximal muscle and neck flexor weakness was noted on examination. Pulmonary function testing revealed restrictive physiology. Creatinine kinase and serological testing were normal and Acid-maltase deficiency was excluded.

A 74-year-old lady presented with dysphagia. She had a right lower lobe pneumonectomy for a T1NOMO non-small cell bronchial carcinoma 3 years previously. A computed tomography scan of the thorax showed oesophageal dilatation, accounting for the presenting complaint, and an incidental thrombus in the pulmonary artery stump (PAS). The formation of a PAS thrombus is a common radiological finding following pneumonectomy [1] . There is no strong evidence to suggest anticoagulation is beneficial in this group of patients. As no respiratory symptoms were present, anticoagulation could not be justified. A 3-month interval scan showed no thrombus propagation and the patient remained asymptomatic.

An 83 year old non-smoking female presented to the ER with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnoea and cough. The patient also recounted difficulty reclining at night to the point where she slept in a sitting position. Examination revealed mild expiratory wheeze and hypoxemia on room air. Initial clinical impression was of an infective exacerbation of late onset asthmatic bronchitis. CXR demonstrated a large hiatus hernia. Pulmonary function studies showed a mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern. CT Thorax revealed large diaphragmatic hernia with evidence of compression of the main bronchi. Bronchoscopy showed dynamic airway collapse with complete obstruction of the left and right main stem bronchi and distal trachea on coughing. This represents an unusual cause of dynamic airway collapse and the imaging and literature are reviewed. A 48 year old lifelong non-smoker with asthma presented to ER with a 3 days history of worsening breathlessness. On examination he was unable to complete sentences and reduced air entry through out chest.CXR showed right middle lobe consolidation. He had been treated as infective exacerbation of asthma. But unfortunately he deteriorated later on that day progressing to respiratory and circulatory failure and subsequently to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Although having best of ICU care he passed away the following day. All of his investigations including blood culture, atypical pneumonia screen, H1N1 serology were came back negative. His post mortem examination hasn't revealed any cause other than right sided pneumonia contributing to his death. This represents a shocking but mysterious case of pneumonia as the cause of death. A 54 year old gentleman was referred to the Rapid Access Lung Cancer service with a 3 week history of progressive SOB and new pleural effusion. Of note, he had recently presented to his general practitioner with two soft tissue lesions on the right flank. On examination, axillary lymphadenopathy was palpable with a noted interval increase in the size of the cutaneous lesions. TruCut biopsy of the skin lesion and pleural aspiration revealed a histological diagnosis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma. Subsequent radiology showed extensive systemic disease and chemotherapy was offered. Our case illustrates the extranodal involvement that can occur in Mantle Cell Lymphoma, however, patients rarely present with initial cutaneous involvement as in our case. A 66 year old gentleman was referred to our lung cancer clinic with abnormal Chest X-ray and palpable supraclavicular node. A staging CT thorax suggested lung primary with mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes. A Biopsy of the palpable node showed Hodgkin's disease (HD). A CT-guided biopsy of the lung lesion favoured lung primary and mediastinal nodal sampling revealed HD. He proceeded to lobectomy for excision of the primary lung lesion and the pathology returned a non Hodgkins lymphoma. This case illustrates a presentation of dual pathologies: both Hodgkins and non Hodgkins Lymphoma in the same patient mimicking locally advanced lung cancer. A 54-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of back pain and cough. He had a normal chest radiograph and was reassured. Subsequent haemoptysis in this patient prompted CT imaging which showed a large left lower lobe mass that was concealed by the cardiac shadow. Further MRI imaging revealed extensive spinal metastases and thus stage IV disease. We wish to present a case series of five patients with benignappearing single plane chest radiography. Further imaging revealed advanced stage lung cancer in these patients. These cases illustrate limitations of single plane radiography and identify anatomical areas where tumours may be missed such as behind the heart.

Fresh sputum cytology confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary nematodes consistent with Strongyloides stercoralis. The patient was treated with high dose Ivermectin, resulting in complete resolution of the pulmonary micronodularity. This case report discusses the diagnostic criteria for relapsing polychondritis, the international issues of pulmonary nematodes and the importance of understanding the three radiological subtypes of pulmonary micronodularity (random, centrilobular and peri-lymphatic). A 21 year old gentleman with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presented acutely to the emergency department with behavioural disturbance. His prior history was notable for a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest radiography identified 1 year prior to admission. His behavioural disturbance manifested by self harm, and had previously precluded in-hospital investigation. CT thorax confirmed right lower lobe consolidation and flexible bronchoscopy identified a 5.5 cm tree branch within a segmental bronchus of the right lower lobe.

In these two cases DIPNECH was diagnosed along side carcinoid tumour via lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node sampling. One patient was symptomatic for at least 18 months prior to diagnosis complaining of episodic wheeze, flushing and diarrhoea. This patient was treated with a somatostatin analogue post operatively. DIPNECH has rarely been described and its prognosis and management have varied from several different case reports [2] . These two cases highlight, that although a rare entity, it needs to be considered in cases of symptomatic cough and wheeze with radiological findings suggestive of discrete pulmonary nodules. In March 2011, the first case of a subsequent outbreak of pansensitive mycobacterium tuberculosis, Beijing strain, was diagnosed in a man from an Irish prison.

All COPD patients should be tested for AATD as per ATS/ERS guidelines. Our data demonstrates that AATD in Ireland is not a rare disease but a disease that is rarely diagnosed. Rationale: Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) is genetic disease that results in low levels of AAT and predisposes individuals to developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The Z-allele is responsible for [95 % cases of AATD. Key studies have demonstrated that excessive infiltration of neutrophils into the lung and neutrophil derived proteins play a pathological role in AATD lung disease. In particular a key cytokine associated with COPD disease progression is TNF-alpha which is also the cause of many problems associated with autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to determine if there is a novel autoimmune element driving inflammation in AATD and examine AAT impact on this. Methods: Plasma and neutrophils were isolated from MM controls, asymptomatic ZZ AATD and AATD patients receiving augmentation therapy. TNF-alpha was quantified by a sandwich ELISA. Evaluation of neutrophil degranulation was carried out by Western blot analysis of neutrophil supernatants for markers of tertiary (MMP-9) and secondary granules (lactoferrin) and via flow cytometry. Autoantibodies against neutrophil granule proteins were quantified in plasma by ELISA. Results: Our results demonstrate that there are high levels of TNFalpha in AATD plasma compared to controls (p = 0.01). In vitro, TNF-alpha caused an increase in the rate of degranulation of tertiary and secondary granules from ZZ AATD neutrophils compared to MM cells (p \\ 0.05). Analysis of autoantibodies against major neutrophil granule proteins revealed a high titer of anti-lactoferrin IgG autoantibodies present in patients with ZZ AATD. Treatment of AATD patients with AAT augmentation therapy resulted in a decrease in the plasma levels of neutrophil granule proteins while also reducing the titer of anti-lactoferrin IgG autoantibodies (P \\ 0.05). Conclusion: This study has uncovered that TNF-alpha inflammatory signaling pathway can result in the development of an autoimmune element in AATD. Furthermore it highlights AAT therapy can impact on neutrophil degranulation and thereby reduce development of novel anti-lactoferrin autoantibodies.

These included dealing with language and cultural barriers, multi-disciplinary management of TB osteomyelitis in a pregnant woman; involving close collaboration with the Obstetric and Orthopaedic teams and managing adverse effects of anti-tuberculous medications in the pregnant patient. Most samples tested showed no evidence of mycobacteria, indicating need for improved case selection prior to testing. Median time to ZN testing is as recommended by guidelines, though there is room for improvement. In an unselected population, likelihood of negative results is high after 2 weeks of negative cultures. However, clinical suspicion should remain high until culture negativity is declared at 7 weeks, particularly when there is a high clinical probability of mycobacterial disease. Background: A number of patients with bronchiectasis have a middle lobe/lingula predominant radiological pattern. Other than an association with non-tuberculous mycobacteria there is a paucity of published data on this subgroup of patients. Methods: We retrospectively analysed data from all patients with non-CF bronchiectasis who underwent bronchoscopy with BAL in a university hospital over a 12 month period. Radiological features, demographic data and microbiology were reviewed. Results: 71 patients with bronchiectasis were assessed. 22 (30 %) had predominant middle lobe/lingular bronchiectasis. In this group 18 (82 %) patients were females compared to 31 (63 %) (p = 0.11) of other patients and mean age was 57 \u00b1 12 compared to 62 \u00b1 12 years (p = 0.73). BAL microbiology in the middle lobe/lingular group revealed no growth in 11 (50 %), H influenzae in 6 (27 %), S aureus in 3 (14 %), MAC in 3 (14 %) and other 2 (9 %). Conclusion: Middle lobe/lingula predominant bronchiectasis is a common radiological pattern particularly in females and only a minority have NTM infection. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation, in part attributable to the potent chemotactic agent leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4 ). The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of exogenous alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) to inhibit LTB 4 signaling. The biological consequence of the described AAT induced inhibition was investigated at the level of neutrophil released proteolytic enzymes. Circulating neutrophils isolated from healthy control volunteers (n = 10) were stimulated with LTB 4 (25-200 nM/2 9 10 7 ) in the presence and absence of AAT (1.8-27.5 lM) for increasing increments of time (0, 5, 10 and 20 min). The level of degranulated proteins in surrounding supernatants was determined by western blot analysis. The ability of AAT to bind LTB 4 was assessed specrophometrically with UV spectra recorded on a Jenway 6405 spectrophotometer at 25\u00b0C. Our in vitro data has shown that levels of degranulated MPO, LL-37 and MMP-9 (markers of primary, secondary and tertiary granule release, respectively) were significantly decreased in the presence of AAT (P \\ 0.05).

The Western blot analysis demonstrated that when Day 4 and 5 supernatants were incubated with AAT, this antiprotease was degraded to give a distinct cleavage pattern. Conclusion: This study is examining for the first time the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria found in CF lung and shows that the proteases produced by anaerobic bacteria are destroying host defense mechanisms and that this may impact other natural host innate antiproteases in the CF lung and play a role in inflammation. CF is a genetic disease with a high prevalence in Ireland. In CF lungs chronic bacterial infection contributes to progressive respiratory failure. In particular, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), forms biofilms in the lungs which significantly contributes to antibiotic resistance. We have previously published on the importance of MIF as a key inflammatory mediator in CF [1, 2] . Building on this work, we hypothesised that MIF enhances biofilm formation in the CF lung contributing to enhanced antibiotic resistance. Using in vitro biofilm formation methods and qPCR we examined the effects of MIF (100 ng/ml) on the growth, antibiotic resistance and gene expression of PA (Strain PAO1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2509, "end": 2512, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2515, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)"}, {"text": "Our results to date have shown that MIF significantly enhances biofilm formation of the PAO1 strain of PA (P \\ 0.05).

Background: AATD disease is a hereditary disorder leading to the development of emphysema. Our group has published first evidence of UPR activation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of ZZ monocytes. Here we study miRNA regulation of UPR in healthy and emphysematous ZZ monocytes. Method: Monocytes miRNAs were profiled using NanoString Technologies. miRDIP portal and KEGG database identified miRNA targets and gene networks. Transfections with 60 nM anti-miR were performed using siPORT-NeoFx. mRNA, miRNA and protein were measured by qRT-PCR, Taqman miRNA assay and Western blotting. Results: Sixty miRNAs were differentially expressed in ZZ versus MM monocytes. miR-199a-5p is overexpressed by [40-fold and predicted to target multiple genes which are enriched for pathways in the ER stress response. Emphysematous versus healthy ZZ patients have decreased miR-199a-5p expression. MiR-199a-5p inhibition increased expression of two arms of the UPR; GRP78 and ATF6. Conclusion: miRNAs are differentially expressed in ZZ monocytes and may play a role in the UPR. miR-199a-5p, predicted to target UPR genes, is overexpressed in healthy ZZ monocytes, and negatively regulates the UPR.

Background: Portable devices that determine TST may act as an adjunct to level 3 diagnostic tests for OSA. The SWA is such and measures TST using a proprietary algorithm.

Aim: Correlation of TST by SWA and NPSG, in a population with and without sleep apnoea. 89 consecutive patients undergoing NPSG because of a suspicion of OSA wore an SWA on the same night. Patients were stratified by the presence and severity of OSA. Correlation coefficient for TST were determined between SWA and NPSG for all subjects and in the OSA subgroups.

We also observed that patients reported different qualitative sensations suggesting that more than one mechanism may contribute to dyspnea. The purpose of this study is to determine whether dyspnea experienced in weaning-failure patients is related to changes in PCO 2 or increase in respiratory effort or both. Methods: Tracheostomized patients who were being weaned from prolonged mechanical ventilation at a specialized facility were enrolled. Dyspnea, transdiaphragmatic pressure-time product (PTPdi), minute ventilation, and transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO 2 ) were measured during a 1-h trial of spontaneous breathing. Patients who developed respiratory distress during the trial were considered weaning failures. Patients who tolerated the trial and continued to breathe unassisted for at least 24 h after the trial without signs of distress were considered weaning successes. Results: 28 patients were studied; 11 were women; age, 65 + 3 (SE) years; duration of ventilation before the study, 28 + 2 days. Fourteen patients were weaning successes; 14 patients were weaning failures. In the failures, dyspnea score increased from 4.5 + 0.8 at the start to 6.9 + 0.9 at the end of the trial (p \\ 0.01). The increase in dyspnea in the failures was accompanied by increases in minute ventilation (p \\ 0.01) and PtcCO2 (p \\ 0.01); PTPdi, an index of patient effort, remained unchanged during the trial. In the successes, dyspnea, minute ventilation and PtcCO 2 did not increase during the trial; PTPdi, however, decreased from the start to the end of the trial (p = 0.04). These findings suggest that an increase in PCO 2 , a major driver of minute ventilation, contributes to an increase in dyspnea during weaning failure. That the increase in dyspnea in the failures was not accompanied by an increase in PTPdi together with the successes exhibiting a decrease in PTPdi without any change in dyspnea suggests that effort is not a major determinant of dyspnea during weaning failure.

Methods: Patients between 4 and 11 years with a diagnosis of asthma were eligible for inclusion. The parent was surveyed, by post, 2 weeks prior to the clinic date and asked to complete the asthma control test (ACT) and a respiratory proforma which assessed UACS symptoms, medication usage inclusive of intensification episodes and medical concerns. Mobile telephone numbers were requested. Parents mailed their responses in a supplied stamped envelope supplied. Respondents were divided into two categories (a) ACT score greater than 19 and a non concerning Respiratory Proforma, who were texted not to attend the clinic but supplied with another outpatient appointment and (b) the remainder were texted to attend the clinic. Results: Over 13 clinics the parents of 199 eligible children were surveyed. One hundred and forty-one (71 %) replied of whom 103 (73 %) were well and did not attend the clinic but rebooked. Of 38 who attended, 8 had new symptoms of UACS and 5 had pneumonia. Of 58 who did not reply, 10 forgot to reply, 10 came to clinic with completed questionnaires, 6 had good control. Thirty-five did not attend the clinic of whom 21 were discharged to the family doctor. Conclusion: Asthma care through postal survey with mobile text feedback is an option in the outpatient setting. Background and Aims: Asthma is common in paediatrics with the most difficult to manage being those less than 5 years. This study evaluated the impact of a nurse delivered education program developed for parents of children under 5 years in terms of knowledge gained and parental empowerment. Methods: Twenty parents of children age 4-5 years were invited to attend five 1 h educational sessions which related to asthma pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, clinical assessment and medication use. A specific educational program was developed. Prior to enrollment each parent was administered two surveys; (1) a previously tested asthma questionnaire containing 83 statements, and (2) a survey of parental concerns related to asthma. One month after the program was completed parents asthma knowledge and perceptions of empowerment were reassessed. Results: While 20 parents were enrolled data sets for 19 were available for analysis. The pre-intervention mean knowledge level was 43.1 (52 %) (range 27-56) and post knowledge level was mean 65.5 (79 %) (range 61-72, paired t test \\0001). The parental survey identified asthma recognition and poor coping skills as major themes which the educational program addressed. Conclusion: A targeted asthma educational program improves parental knowledge and enhances parental empowerment.

Murray, C. Gunaratnam, N.G. McElvaney, S.J. To determine the impact of Rhinosinusitis on hospitalised exacerbations and requirement for antibiotics in Idiopathic Bronchiectasis (IB). Methods: A prospective observational study of n = 108 patients (mean age 65.1, 57 % female) with a diagnosis of IB was evaluated using the 20 items Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) questionnaire, a validated disease-specific health related quality of life tool for the assessment of Rhinosinusitis. The number of hospitalisations and courses of antibiotics required for exacerbations was recorded over a 12-month period and Spearman correlation coefficients were applied after testing continuous data for normality (1 sample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test). Differences were considered significant at p \\ 0.05. Results: The global SNOT-20 score of 46.1 \u00b1 21.6 demonstrated a significant impact of nasal symptoms in IB. 30.5 % of patients had very significant rhinosinusitis symptoms (scores C60). There was a significant correlation between global SNOT-20 score and hospitalised exacerbations (R = 0.25; p = 0.009) but not courses of antibiotics (R = 0.16; p = 0.09). All patients with a SNOT-20 score [60 had at least 1 hospitalisation over the 12 month period of study. Conclusion: Rhinosinusitis correlates with hospitalised exacerbations in IB and may prove a potential therapeutic target to reduce risk of hospitalisation. 4.10 Alpha-1 Antitrypsin: a Novel Leukotriene B 4 Antagonist C.A.

Access to polysomnography (PSG) is often difficult. Alternative diagnostic strategies are desirable to decrease the burden on sleep laboratories. The sleep apnoea clinical score (SACS) is a well validated clinical tool with good predictive power for severity grades of OSA. The epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) has no predictive ability. This study, sought to determine whether ESS in patients with high SACS, had improved predictive power to detect the presence of OSA. 288 patients were consecutively screened. Both SACS and ESS were recorded prior to PSG. Correlation between ESS, SACS and apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) were performed. ROC curves were constructed to determine diagnostic accuracy of ESS and SACS. A subgroup analysis of patients with high SACS ([15) was also performed.

Little is known about eating behaviors in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) populations.49 untreated subjects recently diagnosed with OSAS by polysomnography were recruited. Body composition was determined by bio-electric impedence analysis (Tanita BC-418). Eating behavior was assessed using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (3FEQ). 3FEQ is a widely used, reliable and valid instrument (Laessle et al. 1989).

Good inhaler technique is vital for adequate drug delivery.We aimed to assess the inhaler technique of patients attending clinic at Roscommon Hospital and the inhaler devices associated with poor technique. Inhaler technique of patients attending respiratory clinic in July 2012 was assessed by experienced Respiratory CNS. Technique was deemed as Good (Use allowed for drug delivery to lungs) or Poor (resulting in little/no drug reaching the lungs). 46 patients participated in the study. 26 (56.5 %) showed good technique vs 20 who demonstrated poor technique. All patients with poor technique had poorly controlled symptoms. A significant proportion of patients demonstrated poor technique. These patients benefitted from one to one counselling by respiratory CNS. Physicians should evaluate inhaler technique while assessing patients with inadequate control. 3.17 Audit on Prescribing Inhalers in Patients with Pulmonary Diseases I. Kamal, M.

Methods: As part of 'World Spirometry Day' 77 members of the general public presented themselves for spirometry testing. A questionnaire was also completed by each person stating smoking history and presence of respiratory symptoms. Results: 77 people were screened, 42 females and 35 males. Average age was 60 years. 15.5 % were current smokers; 35 % were exsmokers and 49.5 % were non-smokers. 25/77 (32 %) had normal spirometry; 31/77(40 %) had an obstructive profile; 5/77 (6 %) had a restrictive profile 17/77(22 %) had un-interpretable results (very poor technique).

We evaluated all patients who underwent chest wall resection \u00b1 reconstruction in our unit from February 2001 to July 2012. 96 patients were identified. Reconstruction was completed using either a composite of Marlex mesh and methyl-metacrylate or a Goretex sheet. Reconstruction of the chest wall prevents post operative complications and restores the respiratory dynamics by avoiding paradoxical or harmful movements. In the majority of cases, it was possible to approximate the soft tissue over the reconstruction. In selected cases, our plastic surgical colleagues used a variety of flaps to approximate the defect.We looked at mean length of stay, histological types, morbidity and survival. There were no intra-operative mortalities. 30 day mortality was 5.2 %.Chest wall resection is not a common procedure but may be performed in high volume centres with low morbidity and mortality. In those with primary chest wall tumours, a wide resection margin is associated with low recurrence rates. In patients with NSCLC (T3) involving the chest wall, en bloc lung and chest wall resection has a proven curative benefit with excellent 5 year survival. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy is considered a safe diagnostic tool [1] . It is suggested, however, that post-bronchoscopy complication rate increases with age [2] .

Mean age was 82.8 years (SD 2.98). Thirty subjects (31.25 %) had a documented lung disease. Fifty-nine patients (61.45 %) were current or ex-smokers. Indications for bronchoscopy were; to evaluate for malignancy (93.8 %) and to evaluate for TB (6.2 %).

Methods: We retrospectively analysed data on all patients with suspected sarcoidosis who underwent EBUS/EUS since the start of the service.

Resuts: Over 10 months 27 patients (18 males 9 females) with a mean age of 42 \u00b1 10 were assessed. 63 % had stage I disease. 24 underwent EBUS and 3 EUS. 61 lymph nodes (LNs) were sampled in total with a mean of 2.3/patient. Diagnostic yield was 85.2 % with 23 patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis and 1 patient with tuberculosis. There were 3 false negatives yielding a sensitivity for detecting sarcoidosis of 88 %. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors have had a huge impact on the treatment of inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. There is also much interest in the use of TNF-a inhibitors in the treatment of refractory sarcoidosis [1] . Paradoxically sarcoidosis in response to TNF-a inhibitors is increasingly recognised with over 37 cases reported to date [2] . We report a series of three cases of sarcoidosis that developed on TNF-a inhibitors.A 41 year old lady with a history of severe crohn's disease developed a right upper lobe consolidation and respiratory failure following two doses of adalimumab. Investigations for Tuberculosis were negative. A CT guided biopsy of a persistent right upper lobe infiltrate confirmed non caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis.A 41 year old gentleman on etanercept for ankylosing spondylitis presented with dyspnoea and a dry cough. CXR showed diffuse fibrotic change. CT findings and a transbronchial biopsy showing multinucleated giant cells led to a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.A 40 year old man on adalimumab for rheumatoid arthritis was admitted with cough and purulent sputum. CXR and CT Thorax confirmed mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. Investigations were negative for tuberculosis. Endobronchial ultrasound guided needle aspiration showed non caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis.Sarcoidosis in response to TNF-a inhibitors is a rare but increasingly recognised condition. Following exclusion of tuberculosis a high index of clinical suspicion is needed to prevent a delay in diagnosis. The distribution of CD4/CD8 ratios in patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis suggests that substitution of bronchoalveolar lavage cellular analysis for transbronchial biopsy is not advisable.
