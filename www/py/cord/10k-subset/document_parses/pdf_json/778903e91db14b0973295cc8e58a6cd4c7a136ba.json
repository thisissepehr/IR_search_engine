            "text": "Background: General self-efficacy is considered one of the most influential parameters affecting the quality of clinical practice and nurses' perceived professional benefits (NPPB). Perceived organizational support (POS) is regarded as being central in understanding job-related attitudes, and it is important to enhance POS for nurses to maintain their current employment. NPPB can further reduce nurses' job burnout and turn-over intention. Many studies have explored the relationships among general self-efficacy, POS, nursing practice environment (NPE) and NPPB. However, a moderating effect of NPE has not been fully explored in nurses, especially among paediatric nurses. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2018 with 300 paediatric nurses from 3 Class A tertiary hospitals in Jilin Province. The respondents completed the General Self-Efficacy Scale, Perceived Organizational Support Scale, Practice Environment Scale and Nurses' Perceived Professional Benefits Scale. The data were analyzed using path analysis and SPSS (version 23.0, IBM). Results: General self-efficacy and POS were significantly positively associated with NPPB, which showed that the model had a good fit to the data. NPE was found to play a partial mediating role between POS and NPPB and also had a complete mediating role between general self-efficacy and NPPB. Conclusions: The results suggest that general self-efficacy indirectly influences NPPB, and POS directly and indirectly influences NPPB by NPE. Effective measures should be taken to improve nurses' practice environment in hospitals to raise nurses' enthusiasm and confidence in their work.",

In contrast, the imbalance in the supply of paediatric nurses has become even more prominent. According to a previous report, approximately 70.7% of paediatric nurses in China have suffered from workplace violence, which has seriously affected their self-esteem and professional identity, resulting in job burnout, which has brought adverse outcomes to the entire nursing industry. Researchers have done a substantial amount of work and have found that NPPB are an effective mechanism to stimulate the inner potential of nurses [5] . NPPB refer to a positive emotional experience from the nursing practice. Moreover, nurses can perceive the gains and benefits brought by their profession in the process of the nursing practice and agree that the nursing profession could promote their overall growth based on positive psychology's theory [6] . Studies have identified a correlation between well-being and perceived professional benefits [7, 8] . When nurses perceive a sense of achievement from the occupation they are engaged in, they are likely to have a sense of job satisfaction, which in turn could address the current shortage of nurses and ensure an adequate workforce of nurses [9, 10] .",

Therefore, we assume that there may be a certain relationship between self-efficacy and NPPB. In this study, NPE refers to an environment that enables nurses to gain more autonomy, responsibility and work control through authorization when providing nursing services [15] .

When POS and the needs of compliments and recognition are met, nurses will have positive emotional attitudes towards nursing and therefore make efforts to achieve organizational goals [23] . A growing body of research demonstrates that POS can increase organizational commitment and work performance and reduce turnover and burnout [24, 25] . Wand et al. [26] reported that POS had a positive relationship with perceived professional benefits, which means that nurses with a higher POS had higher NPPB (P<0.01). Yuan [27] obtained the same conclusion (P<0.05). Currently there are more theoretical studies than intervention literature. Our previous research found a relationship between NPE and POS (P<0.01) [28, 29] . It could be helpful to explore how POS intervenes to produce practical effects in nursing practice. Therefore, the second purpose of this study is to find the relationships among POS, NPE and NPPB.",

Therefore, given that path analysis is an established type of structural equation modelling analysis that simultaneously estimates and tests the directional relationship of a model and is an effective way to identify the direct, indirect, and total effects among variables with other multivariate statistical models [30, 31] , the purpose of this study was to develop and test a hypothesized model that uses path analysis to explore the relationships among GSE, POS, NPPB and NPE; the direction and the size of the relationship between the variables; and if the variables have indirect or direct effects.",

Selfefficacy and POS can directly reinforce NPPB that can be indicated by positive emotional needs, and also can indirectly improve NPPB by a perfect nursing practice environment that can be indicated by perfect managerial support for nursing care, good doctor-nurse relations, nurses engaging in decision making, adequate staffing and resource and the basis of high-quality nursing services.

The sample size for each hospital is 102,98 and 100, and the baseline of these hospitals is essentially the same in terms of working conditions, management, economic income, hospital development, and professional structure. Ethical approval was obtained from an independent research ethics committee in China (ethics number: 2018-554). Participants that met the following inclusion criteria were included in this study: a) those who knew about and agreed to participate in the study; b) on-the-job clinical paediatric nurses with an RN license of the People's Republic of China; and c) those who had worked more than 1 year. The following exclusion criteria were used in this study: a) nurses who were currently completing their internship and/or in training at other hospitals; b) nurses who, during the investigation, had further studies to complete or needed to take sick leave; and c) nurses who were not on duty during the investigation. We carried out a strict level of quality control. Three trained research assistants were sent to collect data in the hospitals. After explaining the purpose and significance of the study, all participants were told that their responses were completely anonymous, and participants declared that their responses were not affected by any power or person according to the informed consent. Respondents had 15~25 minutes to complete the questionnaires. Overall, 320 questionnaires were distributed. After eliminating invalid questionnaires, 300 questionnaires were suitable for statistical analysis (response rate of 92.3%). It has been previously determined that more than 200 samples should be obtained for path analysis [32] . Therefore, the inclusion of 300 paediatric nurses was consistent with this rule.",

Moreover, when POS meets the nurses' emotional needs, a sense of responsibility and emotional commitment to the organization is likely to be produced, and their turnover tendency can therefore be reduced [20, 43, 44] . This also proves the results of POS on NPPB from another aspect.",

            "text": "However, there is limited research on how POS improves NPPB; in this study, NPE and all of the dimensions are positively correlated with NPPB. By allowing nurses to participate in hospital affairs, providing Abbreviations: POS Perceived organizational support, GSE General self-efficacy, NPE Nursing practice environment, NPPB Nurse's perceived professional benefits, SD Standard deviation **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05 sufficient human and material resources, ensuring highquality nursing services, improving nurse leader's ability and leadership style and enforcing doctor-nurse cooperation, nurses can increase NPPB. Therefore, we believe that POS must be stimulated in a certain environment to produce certain benefits. An international study has found that hospitals with good work environments and nursing staff improves nursing outcomes, and the quality of the good hospital work environment included perfect managerial support for nursing care, good doctor-nurse relations, nurses engaging in decision making and organizational priorities on care quality [45] . Other researchers have all reported that NPE had a significant bearing on job satisfaction, intention to leave a current position, job retention, job burnout, job-related stress and anxiety [46, 47] . The good NPE listed above could provide nurses with the opportunity to expand job skills and informal networks and increase their knowledge of the system. This leads a better awareness of perceived organizational support and encourages nurses' motivation to succeed and enhance their commitment [48, 49] . In summary, a good practice environment makes nurses accept and cherish their job and positive emotions develop, such as attachment to the organization, gratitude, a sense of security, and a sense of responsibility. As a result, nurses get paid more for their work and give more in return for their pay, which forms a virtuous circle. In this study, general self-efficacy had no direct effect on NPPB. Several studies have reported a correlation between general self-efficacy and NPPB [50, 51] , but these previous studies only tested two variables and were aimed at nursing interns or nursing students who were at the early stage of their internship. In these studies, other factors were not taken into account, particularly the nursing practice environment, working hours and especially the paediatric practice environment. Therefore, in this study, we found no direct effect between general self-efficacy and NPPB. However, general self-efficacy had an effect on the nursing practice environment, which has been demonstrated in many studies [52] . On the one hand, nurses with a high level of self-efficacy can better perceive the benefits of the nursing practice environment and can make full use of the benefits of the environment for themselves. Therefore, their POS is also at a high level, and the correlation between POS and general self-efficacy was confirmed in this study. On the other hand, they can also avoid the disadvantages of the environment and find appropriate solutions, thus not only promoting selfadaptation and development but also promoting the development of nursing work. Above all, a good nursing practice environment could be regarded as a moderating variable, increasing staff's perceived professional benefits. For successful implementation, nursing administrators should implement effective strategies to promote a comfortable practice environment [6, 53] .",

First, perceived occupational support had a stronger direct effect on nurses' perceived professional benefits, which suggests the value and role of perceived occupational support. As a nursing manager, we should take measures to establish and improve welfare mechanisms, such as to improve the work system, leave system, scheduling system, and welfare system of paediatric nurses, to reduce compassion fatigue by reinforce personality traits, to maintaining the habit of engaging with outdoor activities [54] . Hospital administrators may strengthen family support and social support for pediatric nurses. For instance, a psychological counseling department should be set up to regularly realize paediatric nurses' needs. Second, the nursing practice environment played an intermediary role between perceived occupational support and nurses' perceived professional benefits, so strategies should be implemented to optimize the nursing practice environment, focusing on improving paediatric nurses' professional skills, communication skills and reducing the rate of violence and unhealthy phenomena at work. Finally, the findings showed that self-efficacy was prominently associated with the nursing practice environment, perceived occupational support and perceived professional benefits. Thus, paediatric nurses should develop efficient programmes to improve self-efficacy. Meanwhile, an emphasis should be placed on the nursing professional development for paediatric nurses, including the clinical decision-making patterns for pediatric nurses. And hospitals should provide nurses with more opportunities for further study and to improve their confidence and satisfaction in their work.",
