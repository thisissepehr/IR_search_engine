The rs368234815-DG allele is strongly associated with decreased clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here, we further explored the biological function of IFN-l4 expressed in human hepatic cells-a hepatoma cell line HepG2 and fresh primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). We performed live confocal imaging, cell death and proliferation assays, mRNA expression profiling, protein detection, and antibody blocking assays using transient and inducible stable in vitro systems. Not only did we observe significant intracellular retention of IFN-l4 but also detected secreted IFN-l4 in the culture media of expressing cells. Secreted IFN-l4 induced strong activation of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in IFN-l4-expressing and surrounding cells in transwell assays. Specifically, in PHHs, secreted IFN-l4 induced expression of the CXCL10 transcript and a corresponding pro-inflammatory chemokine, IP-10. In IFN-l4-expressing HepG2 cells, we also observed decreased proliferation and increased cell death. All IFN-l4-induced phenotypesactivation of ISGs, decreased proliferation, and increased cell death-could be inhibited by an anti-IFN-l4-specific antibody. Our study offers new insights into biology of IFN-l4 and its possible role in HCV clearance.",

However, IFN-l4 was detectable at low levels in culture media of transfected cells by Western blot analysis after acetone precipitation (Hamming and others 2013) . Now, we developed a MesoScale assay (an electrochemical ELISA) and were able to detect IFN-l4 in culture media of transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A) . Treatment of these cells with a custom a-IFN-l4 antibody decreased the interferon signaling by 70% (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that IFN-l4 generated in this experimental system is a secreted biologically active interferon. Simultaneously, the a-IFN-l4 antibody did not affect signaling of the main interferons (IFN-a, IFN-b, IFNg, and IFN-l3, Fig. 1C ). Signaling induced by IFN-l4 was strongly attenuated by the JAK inhibitor and by blocking of the IFN-l family receptors (IFNLR1 and IL10R2, Supplementary Fig. S1A -C), confirming these canonical components of the JAK/STAT pathway as essential elements for the IFN-l4 signaling.",

Transfection efficiency was comparable for all these constructs (Fig. 5G , but could not be determined for the secreted IFNL3-Halo), and thus could not explain the observed differences in cell death. We also evaluated cell death in PHHs transiently transfected with IFNL4-Halo or control-Halo constructs. In general, in PHHs, cell death rates were very high even in untransfected cells and similar for both constructs (data not shown), possibly due to physiologically high baseline cell death rates in primary cells unrelated to the effect of IFN-l4.",

However, we now present the first evidence of these effects caused by IFN-l4, the newest addition to the interferon family. While activation of ISGs was observed in both the IFN-l4-expressing and nonexpressing bystander cells, the decrease of proliferation and induction of cell death were detectable only in the expressing cells. This could mean that these effects require different concentration thresholds.",

Anti-proliferative activity of IFN-l4 is ISG dependent as it was blocked by the same a-IFN-l4 antibody that blocks IFN-l4induced activation of ISGs. Some of the ISGs induced by IFN-l4, including 2\u00a25\u00a2OAS and IP-10, are known for their contribution to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of interferons (Rysiecki and others 1989; Hassel and others 1993; Aksoy and others 2006; Liu and others 2011) . At this point, we are unable to determine the mechanism of IFN-l4-induced cell death. Although we did not detect activation of caspase-3 by IFN-l4, therapeutic anti-tumor mechanisms of interferons have been related to cell growth arrest and induction of caspase-3-independent apoptosis via the p53 pathway (Vogelstein and others 2000; Takaoka and others 2003; , and this pathway should be tested for IFN-l4 as well. The effect of IFN-l4 on activation of interferon signaling and cell death might be complex and intertwined, and further studies are warranted.",

Recently, it has also been reported that the same individuals who are more likely to clear the HCV infection, in fact, are significantly more likely to develop liver fibro-proliferative disease (fibrosis), which is associated with increased mortality (Eslam and others 2015) .

The IFN-l4-induced ISGs might provide some antiviral protection, explaining the lower pretreatment HCV loads in individuals with the rs368234815-DG allele, compared with those who do not carry this allele (Uccellini and others 2012) . On the other hand, the increased pretreatment expression levels of these ISGs have been associated with refractoriness to IFN-a therapy (Dill and others 2011), especially in carriers of the IFNL4-rs368234815-DG or rs12979860-T alleles (Urban and others 2010; Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013) . This could be because IFN-a and IFN-l4 compete for induction of the same set of ISGs, and, once activated by IFN-l4, these ISGs do not respond to IFN-a. The fact that despite having lower pretreatment HCV levels, individuals with rs368234815-DG allele are more likely to develop chronic HCV and fail IFN-a-based treatment, suggests that either negative effects of IFN-l4 outweigh its positive effect on lowering HCV viral load or antiviral effects induced by IFN-l4 are insufficient for complete viral clearance.",

Increased cell death has been correlated with inflammation during HCV infection and was suggested as a factor contributing to liver damage (Bantel and Schulze-Osthoff 2003) . High rates of cell death in IFN-l4-expressing cells could amount to substantial cell loss and inflammation, contributing to the development of liver disease. Simultaneously, the anti-proliferative effect of IFN-l4 might limit the tissue remodeling ability that leads to liver fibro-proliferative disease (fibrosis), as has been reported by the largest study on this subject to date (Eslam and others 2015) . Individuals who are genetically unable to produce IFN-l4 or in whom IFN-l4 is not sufficiently induced by specific stimuli may be more likely to clear the infection, spontaneously or after treatment, especially with IFN-abased therapies. However, they may not have the benefit of an anti-proliferative effect also contributed by IFN-l4, and will be more likely to develop fibrosis. Since in our system the a-IFN-l4 antibody efficiently blocked activation of ISGs (including IP-10), and IFN-l4induced cell death, blocking of IFN-l4 with therapeutic agents in carriers of the rs368234815-DG allele might be a plausible therapeutic option before or in conjunction with other treatments. Blocking of IFN-l4 might boost mechanisms of endogenous host immunity, which are important for efficient clearance of HCV and prevention of posttreatment relapse (Meissner and others 2014b) , and also decrease liver damage due to inflammation and cell death.",

Culture media was shared with corresponding nontransfected cells in the transwell assays described in section (A). IFN-l4 was measured in culture media collected from FIG. 3. a-IFN-l4 antibody inhibits activation of ISGs induced by the secreted IFN-l4. (A) Unsupervised clustering and heat map based on auto-scaled expression data for the same ISGs as presented in Fig. 2, but using PHHs from a different liver donor. Presented data are for transwell PHHs, which shared media with transfected cells for 24 h. The transwell cells were exposed to media of PHHs transfected with IFNL4-Halo, IFNL3-Halo, or control-Halo, with and without treatment of culture media with 20 mg/mL of a-IFN-l4 antibody or 40 mg/mL of isotype IgG control. Blue (dark) indicates higher expression, whereas yellow (light) indicates lower expression; fold difference is between the most distant samples on the heatmap-IFNL4-Halo-transfected sample (high) and Halo-transfected and a-IFN-l4-treated sample (low). (B) IP-10 protein expression profile in culture media of PHHs transfected with IFNL4-Halo, IFNL3-Halo, and control-Halo, with or without a-IFN-l4 antibody treatment, all in biological duplicates. FIG. 4. IFN-l4 is retained intracellularly in transfected HepG2 cells. (A) FRAP analysis in HepG2 cells transfected with IFNL4-Halo or control-Halo constructs (green fluorescence).
