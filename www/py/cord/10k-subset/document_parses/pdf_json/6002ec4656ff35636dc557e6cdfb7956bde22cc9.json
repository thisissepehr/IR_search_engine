Isolated working rat hearts were subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion. Infusion of 140 lM A12 or AI before global ischemia improved cardiac function recovery; increased the activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in reperfused heart; and reduced the formation of hydroxyl radical adduct of the spin trap 5,5dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide in the myocardial effluent during early reperfusion compared with these indices in control. Anesthetized open-chest rats were subjected to the left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and coronary reperfusion. Peptide A12 or its analog AI was injected intravenously at the onset of reperfusion at a dose of 0.35 lmol/kg. Treatment with A12 or AI significantly limited infarct size and reduced the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme in blood plasma at the end of reperfusion compared with control. These effects were accompanied by complete recovery of Cu,Zn SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities; and decrease in MDA content in the area at risk by the end of reperfusion.

Several therapeutic methods such as induction of preconditioning, postconditioning, and pharmacological agents have been examined to prevent or limit the I/R injury; however, the suitable treatment modalities have not been fully proved yet [1] . A promising approach to solving this issue is the application of natural biomolecules or their synthetic analogs that may trigger mechanisms of endogenous cardioprotection. One of these compounds is a new adipocytokine apelin, the endogenous ligand for the G-protein-coupled APJ receptor [2] . Apelin and APJ receptor are widely expressed in various organs and tissues, such as the heart, adipose tissue, lung, kidney, and adrenal glands [3] . Apelin and APJ receptor have a functional role in cardiovascular development and may also participate in cardiovascular pathological processes [4] [5] [6] [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 393, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 684, "end": 687, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 834, "end": 837, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 983, "end": 986, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 987, "end": 990, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 991, "end": 994, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 995, "end": 998, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The apelin precursor is translated as a 77-amino-acid pre-proprotein which is processed to C-terminal bioactive fragments including apelin-36, -19, -17, -13 (or its pyroglutamate analog [Pyr] 1 -apelin-13), and -12 [8] . Apelin-12 (A12), one of the most potent apelin peptides, corresponds to the sequence 66-77. A12 is involved in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis and in the central control of feeding [9, 10] . Administration of exogenous A12 reduces arterial blood pressure in anesthetized rats due to activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase [11] and exerts a positive inotropic action in failing myocardium of rodents [12] . APJ receptor is identified as a co-receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) and A12 blocks HIV-1 entry through the receptor [13, 14] . There is a growing body of evidence indicating protective effects of A12 in experimental myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. A12 administration improves postischemic recovery of isolated rat heart after global ischemia [15] . Intravenous A12 injection after regional myocardial ischemia limits infarct size and reduces cardiomyocyte membrane damage in rats in vivo [16] . Recent clinical study revealed that plasma A12 concentration is reduced early after acute myocardial infarction and remains significantly below baseline at 24 weeks [17] . These facts suggest that A12/ APJ system may be a promising tool in the treatment of coronary heart disease. However, apelin peptides are rapidly cleared from the circulation with a half-life of no longer than 5 min because of hydrolysis by various peptidases including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [18, 19] . We synthesized structural analogs of A12 which were more resistant to enzymatic degradation and evaluated their efficacy in rat heart models of I/R injury.

Phosphorylation and activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are also implicated in myocardial protection afforded by apelins [21, 22] .

Importantly, preventing the oxidative stress by A12 and its analog AI improves cardiac function recovery or limits infarct size and promotes membrane integrity at the end of reperfusion. Therefore, these novel peptides may be considered as therapeutic interventions to diminish the progression of myocardial damage during I/R injury. The obtained results are principally consistent with the previously described antioxidant properties of some unmodified C-terminal fragments of apelin. Apelin-13 treatment ameliorated the inhibited SOD activity and reduced ROS formation in cultured cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation [23] . In isoproterenoltreated rats, administration of exogenous apelin-13 decreased LDH activity in plasma and myocardial MDA content [24] . Activation of CAT by [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 prevented oxidative stress-linked hypertrophy in cultured rat cardiomyocytes [25] . Chronic treatment of mice with [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 attenuated pressure-overload-induced LV hypertrophy and decreased plasma lipid hydroperoxide concentration. These effects were associated with increased myocardial CAT activity. Reasons for the increase in antioxidant enzyme activities under the influence of apelin peptides remain unexplored. To our knowledge, there is only mention of the fact that [Pyr 1 ]apelin-13 induced CAT mRNA but not GSH-Px expression in cultured rat cardiomyocytes [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 85, "end": 89, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 372, "end": 376, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 508, "end": 512, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 705, "end": 709, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1895, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2030, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2153, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2648, "end": 2652, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1045, "end": 1056, "text": "(Figs. 1, 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1255, "text": "(Fig. 2b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The enhancement of intracellular Cu,Zn SOD activity is one of the essential components of myocardial protection afforded by A12 and its analog AI. Indeed, large amounts of superoxide anion (O 2 -*) formed during I/R injury may be diminished by the upregulation of SOD. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), the less toxic product of the SOD reaction, can be transformed then into water and O 2 by CAT or into H 2 O as a result of the oxidization of reduced glutathione (GSH) into glutathione disulfide (GSSG) by GSH-Px [37] . It is well documented that apelin administration leads to NO production due to activation of eNOS and upregulation of eNOS gene expression [5, 6, 8, 11] . During reperfusion, NO can be scavenged by O 2 -* with formation of a highly reactive peroxynitrite (ONOO-) [34, 36] . Removing a large fraction of O 2 -* by the increased activity of SOD may also reduce the yield of ONOO-, thus limiting nitrosyl stress. In addition, the opening of mPTP in I/R injury results in a further rise in of ROS generation [35] . Probably A12 or the analog AI may attenuate this stage of oxidative stress due to the activation of Cu,Zn SOD. Thus, enhanced Cu,Zn SOD activity may play a key role in controlling levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in apelin-treated hearts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 511, "end": 515, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 657, "end": 660, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 661, "end": 663, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 664, "end": 666, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 667, "end": 670, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 781, "end": 785, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 786, "end": 789, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1022, "end": 1026, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is likely that A12 and its analog AI can reduce oxidative stress due to the antioxidant properties of NO.

Moreover, endogenous NO is involved in the upregulation of the key antioxidant enzymes, Cu,Zn SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, which represents adaptive protective mechanism to prevent the formation of toxic quantities of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [40, 41] . NO is a mediator of beneficial effects of apelin peptides consisting in a limitation of infarct size, reduction of cell membrane damage, and improvement of postischemic functional and metabolic recovery. Such interconnection is confirmed by a significant reduction or abolition of apelin action in the presence of L-NNA and L-NAME, the inhibitors of NOS, in different models of myocardial I/R injury [21, 22] .
