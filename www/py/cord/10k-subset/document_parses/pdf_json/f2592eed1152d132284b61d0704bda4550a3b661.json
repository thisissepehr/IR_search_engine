Gas exchange occurred via VV ECMO separately. After 48 h of cessation of ventilator support, the patient was back on assisted mechanical ventilation. The patient ultimately recovered with an excellent outcome. Although the clinical significance of zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) and the complete cessation of open lung strategy during ECMO remains controversial, in cases of reduced lung compliance (VT less than 100 mL), discontinuation of ventilation is an option that can be used to prevent ventilator-induced lung damage and to allow the lungs to rest while on adequate VV ECMO support.",

They divided the patients into two groups that received PMXDHP therapy within 8 h (early group) and more than 8 h (late group) from catecholamine administration. They examined the changes in catecholamine dose [catecholamine index (CAI)], catecholamine dose/mean arterial pressure [catecholamine index pressure (CAIP)], PaO2/FiO2 and PEEP level at the start of and 24 h after the start of PMX-DHP therapy. They also examined ventilatorfree days (VFD), ICU-free days (IFD), 28-day and hospital mortality. CAI and CAIP were significantly decreased in the early group. PEEP level in the early group was significantly decreased during PMXDHP therapy. Mortality at 28 days was significantly improved in the early group. They concluded that early induction of PMX-DHP therapy is recommended for the treatment of septic shock in patients with presumed Gram-negative infection.",
