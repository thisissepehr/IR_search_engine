(2009) found that alfalfa, which is mainly composed of IF (Chen et al., 2013) , enhanced oxidative burst production and degranulation of heterophils in laying hens compared to those in an unfed group of hens during the molting period. The authors suggested that this enhancement might be due to the long transit time of alfalfa in the gastrointestinal tract stimulating bacterial degradation of alfalfa cellulose into FOS and thereafter into fermentable substrates such as short chain fatty acids. These compounds could then increase mucosal structure and functionality of the small and large intestines as well beneficially modifying bacterial content of the GIT. The results of the current studies are consistent with outcomes of studies in broiler chicks. Guo et al. (2003) showed that supplementing broiler chickens with \u03b2-1,3/1,6-glucan as IF for 4 wk improved macrophage (a component of innate immune function) phagocytic activity. In a study by Vetvicka and Oliveira (2014) supplementing starter diets for 28 days with \u03b2-1,3/1,6-D-glucan significantly enhanced the ability of neutrophils (heterophils) of 28 day old Leghorn chickens to phagocytose synthetic particles when compared to an un-supplemented control group.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 747, "end": 766, "text": "Lowry et al.

The products of degradation could in turn contribute to decreasing digesta viscosity, accelerating small intestinal fermentation and increasing the digestibility and availability of nutrients (Zhang et al., 2014) . Increasing the viscosity of digesta as a result of xylanase degradation of arabinoxylans will slow down its passage rate and subsequently change the balance of microorganisms by increasing of the fermentative microflora thus producing great amounts of short chain fatty acids and lactic acid .

The variation may have been due to the differences in the chemical structures of the compounds or the proportions of the compounds making up these 2 lignocellulose fiber supplements. Further study would be required to determine possible modes of action of the different fiber types in eliciting beneficial effects on the immune system. Because of the wide variety of ingredients used experimentally to increase dietary fiber content across published experiments, and the variation in chemical structure of fibers in those diets it is not possible to derive specific recommendations regarding effective concentrations of different dietary fibers that will improve growth and immune functions. However, from the positive results described here, both types of commercial dietary lignocellulose fibers (MF and IF) and especially IF, might be useful alternatives to antibiotics for enhancement of growth and the innate, cell-mediated and gut associated immune functions of 4 to 8 wk and 10 to 18 wk old pullets prior to egg laying.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lymphocyte Proliferation"}, {"text": "Mabuchi for showing me how to carry out immune function assays, to Rob Evans and the LARTF staff for help with care of pullets and to Greg Parkinson for advice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lymphocyte Proliferation"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Studies on wheat bran Arabinoxylan for its immunostimulatory and protective effects against avian coccidiosis", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Akhtar", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Tariq", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Awais", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Z", "middle": [], "last": "Iqbal", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Muhammad", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Shahid", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Hiszczynska-Sawicka", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Carbohydr.
