The inbound, summertime tourist population is 1.5 times Alaska's wintertime resident population. 1 Some cruise ships in the region carry upward of 2500 passengers and 1000 crew members originating from many countries. These factors, along with close quarters and prolonged contact among travellers on ships and during land-based tours before embarkation, increase the risk of communicable disease transmission. Influenza outbreaks among cruise ship passengers and crew members are relatively common, and may be prolonged and challenging to control as new, susceptible passengers embark at frequent intervals. 2, 3 Cruise ships destined for US ports of entry are required by federal regulations to report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) all deaths on board, and certain signs and symptoms suggestive of infectious disease in passengers and crew members. 4 Cruise ships are required to report gastrointestinal illness to CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program at least 24 h before a ship's arrival at a US port. 5 In contrast, cruise ships are not required to conduct respiratory illness surveillance. However, CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine asks cruise ships to report outbreaks of influenza-like illness (ILI) and to complete end-of-voyage cumulative ILI reports. Ships voluntarily report the total number of crew members and passengers with ILI either electronically or by phone to the CDC Quarantine Station with jurisdiction over the port of call. If a ship's ILI incidence rate exceeds the CDC-defined outbreak threshold of 1.380 cases per 1000 traveller days, 6 CDC requests enhanced data collection and, in coordination with the state health department, provides consultation on influenza testing. If influenza viruses are detected in crew members or passengers, recommendations are made regarding control measures, including antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis, isolation of ill individuals, monitoring of exposed individuals, and vaccination of crew members.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 187, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 698, "end": 700, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 701, "end": 702, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 966, "end": 967, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1117, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1690, "end": 1691, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "During low influenza activity periods such as summer, influenza outbreaks in the USA and Canada have been linked to influenza virus transmission among tourists travelling on combined land-sea tours or cruise ship voyages, particularly in Alaska. 3, 7 Cruise ship passengers who are at increased risk for more severe disease, such as the elderly or immunocompromised, may develop severe complications from influenza such as pneumonia, which may result in disembarkation for hospitalization. The value of cruise ship influenza surveillance is highlighted by outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza among passengers and crews, 2,7-9 and the potential for introduction of antigenically drifted seasonal influenza virus strains. 3 For example, in 1997, an antigenically drifted H3N2 virus strain identified in ill Australian cruise ship passengers became the predominant virus during the subsequent 1997-1998 influenza season in North America. 10 Cruise ship ILI reporting to CDC is aggregate and does not include a laboratory component. Integration of syndromic and virologic surveillance could improve the ability to detect and characterize influenza virus strains and other respiratory viruses circulating among cruise ship travellers. From May through September, 2013-2015, the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL), CDC Influenza Division, CDC Anchorage Quarantine Station and two cruise lines initiated a pilot laboratory-based surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on a few cruise ships in Alaska.

Ship staff obtained verbal consent from the individual (if an adult) or permission of a parent or guardian (for those under 18 years old).

The GenMark eSensor \u00ae 14-target Respiratory Virus Panel was used per manufacturer guidelines to determine the presence or absence of influenza and other respiratory viruses. A random subset (~1 of every 4) of specimens testing positive for influenza viruses was shipped to the CDC Influenza Division Laboratory for cell culture and antigenic characterization by using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) methods. 11 For viruses that did not yield sufficient titre for HI testing, genetic characterization (sequencing) was conducted to determine the influenza type, subtype or genetic group. 12 In addition to personal identifiers collected on the ASVL requisition form per standard protocol for clinical specimens, ship medical staff provided ASVL demographic, clinical and epidemiological information for each specimen. This information included whether the individual was a crew member or passenger, age, sex, country of residence, recent travel history outside the USA or Canada, date and port of embarkation, influenza vaccination history (self-report), illness onset date and symptoms, receipt of antiviral treatment prior to specimen collection, and whether other travelers on board had respiratory illness.

As southbound voyages originating in Alaska had peak onset dates on the day before the start of the voyage, most influenza virus transmission may have occurred before embarkation. Southbound voyages are generally associated with land-based tours immediately preceding the voyage involving buses and trains, which are additional semi-closed and close-contact environments that can potentially facilitate the transmission of influenza viruses. Conversely, northbound voyages (which often have their land-based tours post-voyage) had peak onset dates occurring mid-voyage, suggesting that most influenza virus transmission occurred on board.

Thus, cost could be a disincentive for passengers to seek care until they are severely ill or need to be medically evacuated to a hospital. 3 This disincentive, in addition to participating cruise ship physicians' accuracy in targeting ill individuals for pilot project inclusion, may have contributed to the pilot's relatively high percent positive yield on respiratory pathogen and influenza testing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 855, "end": 856, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "ILI outbreaks can have economic and human resource costs to both cruise ships and public health agencies.
