No rodents were captured inside the households of patients in El Bolson, and rodent-trapping attempts around the town were unsuccessful[21\u2022].In the United States, only universal precautions are recommended for patients suspected of having HPS. In areas where Yersinia pestis is endemic, patients are often placed in respiratory isolation until pneumonic plague is ruled out because symptoms may mimic those of HPS.From May, 1993 through December 7, 2000, 277 cases of HPS were reported in the United States [22].
