The object of learning in both is the economic principle of changes in price as a function of changes in the relative magnitude of changes in demand and supply. The patterns of variation and invariance, defining the conditions compared were built into pedagogical tools (text, graphs, and worksheets). The first study is the latest in a series of studies aiming to test the fundamental conjecture of the Variation Theory of Learning that new meanings are acquired from experiencing differences against a background of sameness, rather than experiencing sameness against a background of differences. The study compares the learning outcomes under conditions consistent with the basic conjecture with the learning outcomes under conditions not consistent with the theory. The results support the conjecture. The second study shows, however, that the conditions that are consistent with the theory cannot be decided unless the learners' pre-requisites for the task in question are taken into consideration. One set of the pedagogical tools was found to be highly effective for learners with a better initial grasp of the object of learning, while another set was found to be equally effective for learners with a weaker initial grasp of the object of learning. The two sets were equally ineffective when used for the ''wrong'' group of learners.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "''conditions of learning'' denote patterns of variation and invariance in terms of which ''the object of learning'' (that which is to be learned) appears to the learners.

Variation Theory is not a theory about how learning is organized, but a theory about how the content of learning is organized. It assumes that in order to become able to discern necessary features of the object of learning (i.e., making a certain meaning your own) the learner must experience certain patterns of variation and invariance. It is a general theory of the learning of specific contents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The point of departure of this theory is the question: How can we make novel meanings our own? That is to say, how can we learn in the sense of acquiring new meanings? Let us say a teacher is introducing a new topic, ''linear equations''. She points to many different examples, all being linear equations but differing otherwise. Can the students understand the meaning of ''linear equations''? Hardly. You cannot find a new meaning by inspecting instances that have that meaning in common but differ otherwise. However, you can actually find a new meaning by inspecting instances that differ from the focused meaning, but are the same otherwise; through contrast, that is. You can find out what ''linear equations'' mean by comparing linear equations with quadratic equations. You may understand what ''dry white wine'' is by comparing white wines that are dry with white wines that are not. We cannot imagine someone who has only seen dogs to be able to distinguish between ''dog'' and ''animal''. Meanings have to be learned through the experience of variation and invariance, through the experience of difference and sameness.

During the last 15 years a great number of studies have been carried out in which different conditions for appropriating the same object of learning have been compared in terms of patterns of variation and invariance (see, for instance , Lo 2012; Marton 2013) . In all studies that we are aware of, conditions consistent with the theory were correlated with better outcomes of learning than conditions not consistent with the theory. In basically all these studies, however, explaining differences in the outcomes of learning in terms of patterns of variation and invariance was ad hoc. The patterns were observed and not defined in advance. This was partly because many of these studies were observational, and partly because even when the pedagogical design was theoretically grounded, its instantiation differed from the plan because of the interactive nature of teaching. Therefore, in some other studies, like the two reported below, theoretical principles were embedded in pedagogical tools and more stringent experiments were carried out. So how can the conjecture be put to test?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 297, "text": ", Lo 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 298, "end": 310, "text": "Marton 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Comparing induction and contrast Ki and Marton (2003) made a direct comparison between the two alternatives formulated in the conjecture in relation to the learning of Cantonese tones.

To achieve this understanding, children had to learn to discern demand, to discern supply, and to be able to focus on both simultaneously. The conjecture implies that a necessary condition for this understanding is first the experience of variation in demand (a focused aspect, or what the children are supposed to learn to discern) and invariance in supply (also a focused aspect), then the experience of variation in supply and invariance in demand, and finally the experience of variation in both simultaneously. Such variation must occur against a background of invariance in the unfocused aspect of the item in question. Accordingly, variation in demand and invariance in supply, and then invariance in demand and variation in supply, followed by variation in both, is consistent with the conjecture if the item is the same throughout. There are, however, many ways in which a pattern of variation and invariance may be inconsistent with the conjecture. In Marton and Pang's (2012) study, the unfocused aspect, the good for auction, varied under the condition compared with the pattern consistent with the conjecture. This seemingly minor difference had a highly significant effect on learning. This was the second experimental study in which the conjecture was put to the test and supported by the findings.

This time, the comparison was made with a pattern in which the unfocused aspect was consistent with the conjecture, but the focused aspects were not. We had carried out a similar comparison (Pang and Marton 2007) previously in a follow-up study on the effects of changes in the relative magnitude of demand and supply on changes in price (Marton and Pang 2006) . Two groups of economics students of the same level were taught by two teachers judged to be equally skillful. The introduction to the topic was framed in terms of the same single example for both groups (in the original study, it was used by the more successful group). The example was changes in the demand, supply, and price of face masks during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. The lesson design in Marton and Pang's (2006) original study using the same item was dramatically superior to the design in which different products were used. In the follow-up study, both groups used the same example, and hence the same product. However, in the experimental group the teacher used learning tasks that concerned change in demand and the magnitude of change in demand, with supply kept invariant, and learning tasks involving change in supply and the magnitude of change in supply, with demand kept invariant. In contrast, the teacher of the comparison group used learning tasks concerning concurrent changes in demand and supply and the magnitude of changes in both. For both groups, the lesson culminated with a fusion component in which all aspects were varied at the same time. After this introduction, both groups received the same formal instruction explaining what happens to prices when there are simultaneous changes in both demand and supply and in the magnitude of those changes. The experimental group convincingly outperformed the comparison group. The teacher's effort in the experimental group to make it possible for the students to discern the two critical aspects of demand and supply and changes in their magnitudes separately was obviously useful (see Fig. 3 ). The students in the comparison group dealt with the same issues (but encountering changes in demand, supply and in the magnitude of those changes simultaneously) when working in groups. Under that condition, the students did not seem to be equally successful in discerning the critical factors of changes in price (differences in the relative magnitude of changes in demand and supply. The price went up, for instance, when both demand and supply increased, but the increase in demand was greater). When comparing two lessons taught by two different teachers in which the (enacted) objects of learning differ, it is impossible to argue that the conditions are the same in other respects. We thus decided to test the conjecture by embedding the two patterns in pedagogical tools to try to replicate the earlier findings without this potential bias. In Study 1, the object of learning, or what the students were supposed to learn, was to account for a change in the market price of a product by considering the relative magnitude of the change in its supply and demand, which is similar to the object of learning in the studies of Marton and Pang (2006) and Pang and Marton (2007) . The pedagogical principle to be examined in this experiment was whether the sequence of the patterns of variation and invariance (the focused aspects being varied one at a time, followed by simultaneous variation in both focused aspects, compared with both aspects varying simultaneously from the beginning), would affect students' discernment of the critical aspects of the object of learning.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 332, "end": 354, "text": "(Pang and Marton 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 480, "end": 502, "text": "(Marton and Pang 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 906, "end": 930, "text": "Marton and Pang's (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3312, "end": 3334, "text": "Marton and Pang (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3339, "end": 3361, "text": "Pang and Marton (2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2173, "end": 2179, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "The role of irrelevant variation"}, {"text": "According to the Variation Theory of Learning (e.g. Marton and Pang 2006; Marton and Tsui 2004) , to be able to attend to all of the critical features of an object of learning simultaneously, students first need to discern the critical features one at a time and then bring them together. A fair number of students need help in discerning the different critical features separately at the start, which can be achieved by varying a certain dimension of variation while keeping the other dimensions invariant.

To provide the students with a meaningful context in which to learn this abstract and difficult economic concept, both sets of learning resources made use of a case study of the face mask market when the SARS epidemic hit Hong Kong to exemplify how a simultaneous change in demand and supply affects the price of a good of which the students had direct experience.

Exploring this relationship is the next step in our continued testing of the conjecture.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion of Study 1"}, {"text": "The learner and the object of learning In Study 1, we put the basic conjecture of Variation Theory (meaning does not derive from sameness, but rather from difference) to the test, and obtained evidence to support it. We achieved this by contrasting two patterns of variation and invariance, one consistent with the conjecture and the other inconsistent. We were then able to show that the former pattern (consistent) was more conducive to learning than the latter (not consistent). However, it is questionable whether we can say that, in general, one particular pattern is consistent with the conjecture and another is not. The kind of learning that we are interested in is the appropriation of new meanings. If the meanings are new for all involved, then we can assume that it is more likely that learning will occur if the pattern of variation and invariance is consistent with the Interaction between the learners' and the learning resource afforded 1075 basic conjecture of the theory. However, it is very difficult to find a meaning that is within the reach of a group of learners, but have not been discerned by any of them previously. Thus, in most cases we must take into consideration what learners already know before we can decide on the optimal pattern of variation and invariance. Ki et al. (2006) carried out a study examining how speakers of non-tonal languages can be helped to learn Cantonese tones. Learners were invited to deal with varying tones of words (focused) with the same segmental (sound, but not tone) aspect (unfocused). They then dealt with varying segmental aspects of words with the same tones. Finally, they dealt with words in which both the tonal and segmental varied simultaneously. This approach of starting with variation in one aspect at a time was a more powerful approach than dealing with simultaneously varying aspects from the beginning (as also shown in Study 1 above). In Chik et al. (2010) study of young children learning Chinese words, dealing with different aspects of the same word (meaning, pronunciation, written form; all focused) simultaneously was a more powerful learning strategy than dealing with one aspect at a time over varying words.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1294, "end": 1310, "text": "Ki et al.

We suggest that differences in outcome related to the same pattern of variation and invariance are related to differences in the object of learning. In the tone learning study, it was critical for learners to learn to discern the tone aspect and relate it to the meaning aspect. Hence, the learner needed to encounter words that differed in tone but not in segments (vowel and consonant sounds). These words also differed in meaning. Thus, learning to discern was the first task. In the case of the Chinese words, however, the learners were native speakers of Chinese. They could already pronounce the words, or at least easily imitate their pronunciation. They could probably write some of them and understand the meaning-at least partially-of most of them. They had no doubt already discerned the three aspects of the words and in all likelihood knew one or several features of the words to be learned. They did not need to learn to discern the aspects, but rather needed to learn how to bring the aspects together and thus draw on the linguistic resources that they already possessed to appropriate new meanings. Accordingly, fusion was a more powerful pattern of variation and invariance in the case of the Chinese words. In the case of the Cantonese tones, the reverse was true.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study 2"}, {"text": "It is clear that we cannot argue that one pattern of variation and invariance is always better than another (except in the case of induction of novel meanings, which we argue cannot possibly work at all). The patterns form a sequence from the general undivided whole to separation (from contrast to generalization) and then to fusion. It is not the case that once someone has achieved a certain level, he or she can attain that level in all scenarios. Rather, we argue that to master any problem the learner must be able to discern the critical features and to focus on them simultaneously, which involves being able to separate the critical and non-critical features from the object of learning and bring the former together. Variation Theory cannot tell us which pattern of variation and invariance to try to bring about. It only holds that this pattern is what matters, because experiencing it is what it takes to learn something. Anyone trying to help another person to learn has to determine the object of learning in each specific case. If-and only if-we can identify the learning target and what the learner has already appropriated can we determine the correct object of learning.

In this case, the students who had already discerned demand and supply, that is, those who expressed Conception C or D in the pre-test, did not need support to discern demand and supply. Most of those expressing Conception C needed support to bring the critical aspects that were discerned together. In other words, they needed to encounter fusion, whereby both critical features vary simultaneously, which is exactly what Text B accomplished.

Tables 3 and 4 show a very strong interaction between the texts and the sub-groups. In accordance with our expectations, the two texts had a markedly different effect on the two groups of students. In the group with better results in the pre-test, 33.3 % more of the students working with Text A and 68.8 % more of those working with Text B expressed the target understanding (Conception D) in the post-test relative to the pre-test. The corresponding figures for the group with poorer pre-test results were 68.8 and 36.1 %, respectively. Text A seemed to be better aligned for the group with poorer results in the pre-test, and Text B for the group with better results in the pre-test. Helping the students to discern demand or supply when they can already do it without any help seems to have a negative effect on learning. The percentage increase in students reaching the target understanding was exactly the same in both groups when they worked with the texts that were best aligned for them. When working with texts that were not so aligned, however, the initially weaker group performed slightly better despite a lack of overlap between the two groups in the pre-test. This finding indicates a remarkably strong interaction between the pre-test results and the different patterns of variation and invariance in the texts.

The concept was not successful, but we nevertheless argue that it is reasonable to expect that efforts to help students to learn should build upon what they have learned previously. The educational objectives that are formulated for specific levels, curricular units, or even single lessons are the same for all students. However, every educational objective is a complex of component parts, some of which some students will already have learned, and others not. Educational objectives do not tell us what the students need to learn; they tell us what the students are expected to become able to do. However, powerful teaching must take as its point of departure that which students need to learn. Where it does so, it contributes to powerful learning, as we have tried to demonstrate with this study. The object of learning for the students who had not discerned demand and supply before the lessons was to learn to make such discernments, but also to bring the critical aspects together and arrive at an understanding of the role of the relative magnitude of changes in demand and supply. The object of learning for the students who had discerned demand and supply before the lesson was simply to bring the two critical aspects together and to arrive at an understanding of the effect of relative magnitude of change in demand and supply on changes in price. The educational objective, or learning target, was the same for both groups, but the object of learning in terms of critical features differed.

The implication of this conjecture is that experienced patterns of difference and sameness play a key role in learning, especially in learning that entails appropriating novel meanings, which is also referred to as conceptual learning. Meaning is defined here as the various features of a phenomenon that are discerned by the learner and focused on simultaneously. Discerning a feature amounts to separating it from that which it is a feature of, as well as from other features. According to the conjecture, such separation presupposes the experience of variation in that which is to be separated and the experience of sameness in that from which the feature in question has to be separated. Our previous study reported on the role of the experience of sameness as a background against which variation is experienced. In the two studies in this paper, we demonstrated that the pattern of variation and invariance that learners need to experience is a function both of differences in the object of learning and differences among learners. This finding makes it obvious that unless the new meaning to be appropriated is new to all learners, there are no generalized ''best patterns of variation and invariance,'' but rather more and less powerful patterns for a certain object of learning and for certain learners.
