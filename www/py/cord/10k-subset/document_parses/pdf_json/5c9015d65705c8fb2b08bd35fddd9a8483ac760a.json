Measurements and results: Diagnoses, pediatric risk of mortality scoring, indications for, and duration of, mechanical ventilation and neuromuscular blockade, and blood gas data with corresponding ventilator parameters were extracted from the medical records.

Recent guide-lines from the Society of Critical Care Medicine [2] specify the choice of agent and monitoring for NMB, but do not address when it should be used.

Four patients were not included in the analysis, two because of death prior to stopping NMB and two did not have blood gas data throughout their course. The demographic and other data for these 28 patients are shown in Table 1 . NMB was carried out using vecuronium infusion (0.1-0.5 mg/kg per h) and all children were sedated with narcotic and/or benzodiazepine infusions. The changes in ventilator settings and oxygenation index in the 48 h before and after stopping NMB were analyzed (Fig. 1) . All but two of the children were maintained on the same ventilator mode in the 48 h after stopping NMB. These two children remained on synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) on the Siemans Servo 900C ventilator, but had pressure support added to support spontaneous ventilatory efforts. The mean airway pressure (MAP) decreased significantly within 4 h, the fraction of inspired oxygen concentration (FiO ) within 8 h (not shown) and ventilator rate within 12 h of stopping NMB, while there was no change in peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). The OI improved within 12 h, reflecting that arterial oxygen tension (PaO ) was stable while FiO and MAP were lowered. PaO and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO ) did not change (not shown). There were no significant changes in these parameters in the 48 h preceding stopping NMB. All children with RSV disease were ventilated using either intermittent mandatory ventilation or timecycled, pressure-limited modes of ventilation using a Siemans Servo 900C, Bournes BP200, or comparable infant ventilator. The use of continuous NMB was highly correlated with the attending physician (p(0.01, data not shown). Despite the comparable demographics, PRISM scores and degree of oxygenation dysfunction upon the initiation of mechanical ventilation, as reflected by oxygenation index, children with RSV disease receiving NMB spent more than twice as long on mechanical ventilation as those that did not receive NMB.

This did not appear to be due to the selection of a sicker patient population, as NMB was instituted from the onset of ventilation and its use strongly correlated with the child's attending physician.
