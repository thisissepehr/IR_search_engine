Method: Twenty-five CCs with KRAS mutation and at least 10 PDC in a 20\u00d7 microscopic field were considered. Tumour cells forming PDC and main tumour mass were separated by laser microdissection and KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA mutational status was analyzed in each of the two components by using mass spectrometry. Results: In 20 cases PDC had the same biomolecular profile as the main tumour, but in 2 cases they had WT KRAS and in 3 cases they had additional PIK3CA mutations not observed in the main tumour. Cases with PIK3CA mutations in PDC but not in the main tumour had higher frequency of nodal metastases (P = 0,07), high pTNM stage (P = 0,07) and LVI (P = 0,07), although statistical significance was not reached. Conclusion: Intra-tumour heterogeneity in biomolecular profile of CC may depend upon different histological aspects. Since PDC reflect epithelial mesenchymal transition and they are likely to produce metastatic disease, their molecular status, if different from that of the main tumour, may be relevant for prediction of response to targeted therapies.",

This study aims to investigate expression of MEK1 and DIAPH3 in colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma (MA) and non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (NMA), and their relation to clinicopathological and survival data. Method: Tumour tissue specimens from 75 patients with colorectal MA and 75 NMA were included in the study. All clinicopathological data of these 150 cases were revised with re-examination of all their slides. Three high density manual tissue microarrays were constructed and immunohistochemistry for MEK1 and DIAPH3 was done.",

MEK1 overexpression was significantly associated with positive lymphovascular emboli in the NMA group and with old age in MA group. DIAPH3 overexpression was not significantly associated with any of the tested variables. MEK1 overexpression was associated with better overall survival. Conclusion: MEK1 and DIAPH3 have a significant interrelated role in colorectal carcinogenesis, especially in the non-mucinous type. Unlike DIAPH3, MEK1 overexpression is associated with better survival. Patients with non-mucinous carcinomas, and not mucinous ones, can benefit from MEK1 and DIAPH3 targeted therapies.",

            "text": "Objective: Immunohistochemical biomarker evaluation on TMAs is a standard technique. Until now, few attempts have been made to retrieve the maximum information from digital pathology during construction of TMAs and their subsequent analysis. As CDX2 (and CDX1) may have potential predictive power as colorectal cancer biomarkers, we aim to assess their robustness in terms of pre-analytics, tumour heterogeneity and effects of different intensity-percentage combinations on patient selection and prognosis. Method: Next-generation tissue microarrays (ngTMA) of 636 colorectal cancer patients with cores covering tumour center and invasive front were immunostained for CDX1 and CDX2, scanned and analysed using Tissue Studio software (Definiens) Pre-analytical variables analysed included storage and fixation times. Three different types of heterogeneity were defined and investigated; prognostic relevance was determined. Results: A complete ngTMA-DIA workflow can optimize on-target punching and leads to less core-loss. Pre-analytically both biomarkers were stable. Over 7 million epithelial cells of finally 612 accessible patients were labelled. Tumour heterogeneity was only slightly detectable as a mosaic, but excluded for the targeted differences between center and front as well as for occurrence of haphazard hot/cold spots. CDX1 and CDX2 protein loss are independent biomarkers of worse prognosis in multivariate analysis. Two-dimensioned intensity-percentage graphs can highlight the differences in cohort stratification and patient selection. Conclusion: Tumour heterogeneity of CDX1 and CDX2 is minimal and protein expression is stable over different fixation and storage times. Both markers are prognostically relevant. However, we recommend that CDX2 loss be evaluated as percentaged complete negativity. New standards for digital image analysis are needed.",

            "text": "Objective: It is hypothesized that tumour buds in colorectal cancer represent an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype. Here, we determine the existence and frequency of an epithelial/mesenchymal double-positive cell type and its origin in colorectal cancer. Method: One tumour block from a patient with high-grade tumour budding was cut, immunostained for cytokeratin (CK) and scanned. Using digital pathology, regions of tumour buds, tumour center and normal stroma were annotated, aligned to the block and punched out. Punches were dissociated into single cell suspensions and fluorescently-labeled with CK and vimentin (VIM). Using DepArray technology, cells were sorted based on their single or double-positivity and analysed by NGS (Ion Torrent 50-gene cancer panel). Results: Tumour and stromal fractions contained only CK+ or VIM+ cells, respectively. In the budding fraction, 10 (2.9 %) CK+/VIM+ double-positive cells were identified. Sequencing revealed that CK+ tumour cells carried mutations in BRAF and TP53 and a deletion in PTEN. The exact same mutational profile was seen in the CK+/VIM+ cells. VIM+ stromal cells were negative. Conclusion: CK+/VIM+ double-positive cells exist at the invasion front of colorectal cancer, albeit in low number. These cells originate from the tumour. Whether this is evidence of EMT in colorectal cancer requires further elaboration. Objective: Treatment of neoplasias with ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, has been associated with the development of immune-mediated colitis. Aim of this study was the evaluation of histological and immunological characteristics of ipilimumab-associated colitis (IAC) in 9 patients with severe diarrhea after treatment for metastatic melanoma. Method: The histological features of IAC were evaluated in 9 colonic biopsies. The mucosal immunophenotype was assessed by examination of the inflammatory infiltrate, including semi-quantitative immunohistochemical characterization of lymphocytic subsets and by measuring the relative mRNA expression for lymphocyte-lineage specific transcription factors and cytokines. Results: Histological characteristics were non-specific, highly resembling Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis exhibiting a predominance of either plasma cells or CD4+ T-cells with high CD4/CD8 ratios. Neutrophils and crypts with mucin depleted flat epithelium were almost constantly present. IAC was related to significant upregulation of Th1 and Th17 immunological effector pathways, with high elevations of IFN-\u03b3 (>10-fold increase over baseline) and IL-17A (>5-fold increase). In addition, elevation of the regulatory T cell markers Foxp3 and IL-10, and the TNF-like cytokine TL1A/TNFSF15 was observed. Conclusion: Ipilimumab administration usually results in IBD-like colitis probably ascribed to increased influx of effector lymphocytes and enrichment of the mucosa milieu with pro-inflammatory mediators. Objective: The prevalence of loss of protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in Lynch syndrome (LS) polyps remains poorly studied. We aimed at describing the prevalence of loss of MMR protein expression in LS-associated polyps and to identify independent predictors of MMR deficiency.",

Clinicopathological variables associated to pathological IHC were assessed. Results: The median size of adenomas was 5,2 mm;19 (15,7 %) > 10 mm;11 (9,1 %) were villous and 15 (12,4 %) showed high-grade dysplasia (HGD). IHC was pathological in 69 (57 %) adenomas. In univariate analysis, variables associated with pathologic IHC staining were: female genre (p = 0,04), rectal location (p = 0,02), MLH1 mutation (p = 0,03), HGD (p < 0,001) and size >5 mm (p = 0,001). PMS2 mutation was inversely associated to protein loss (p = 0,03). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors were: HGD (p = 0,02), PMS2 mutation (p = 0,03) and size >5 mm (p = 0,03). Serrated lesions retained protein expression. Conclusion: In LS patients, large adenomas and those with HGD were associated with loss by IHC. Adenomas with PMS2 germline mutations and serrated lesions tended to retain protein expression. Normal IHC in colorectal polyps should not discard a LS diagnosis.",

Method: CRC patients primarily submitted to surgery at Portuguese Oncology Institute-Porto (2003 -2006 were selected; one representative slide/block per case and relevant clinicopathological data were retrieved. Assessment of EZH2 nuclear expression (median percentage \u00b1 interquartile range) in normal mucosa and CRC using a semi-automated software system. Results: A total of 199 cases were selected: median age: 70 years; 111(55.8 %) male; 141(71.0 %) left colon tumours. All cases were adenocarcinomas (5 mucinous; 194 tubular, 183 low-grade); 16 (8,0 %) presented lymphatic invasion; 33 (16.6 %) were stage I, 77 (39.0 %) had lymph node metastases and 21 (11.0 %) displayed distant metastases. EZH2 was overexpressed in CRC (36.70 \u00b1 30.9) compared to normal colon (5.90 \u00b1 7.40). EZH2 expression was significantly higher in right colon tumours (p = 0.022) and in CRCs with regional lymph node metastases (p = 0.047). Age, gender, histological pattern, tumour grade, lymphatic invasion, tumour extent and presence of distant metastasis at diagnosis were not associated with EZH2 expression. A trend for higher EZH2 expression in stage III/IV tumours compared to stage I/II tumours was depicted (p = 0.065). Conclusion: EZH2 may play a role in cell growth and invasion in colorectal carcinogenesis. Quantitative EZH2 immunoexpression might be a promising biomarker for assessing CRC clinical aggressiveness. Survival analysis (ongoing) will determine if this biomarker might be of prognostic relevance.",

Only patients with sample deemed adequate by the central pathologist are enrolled. Samples are analysed for MSI and with targeted exon-NGS. QA/QC criteria are pre-defined and applied from biobank selection to NGS data reporting. Quality performance is monitored also via participation in proficiency testing programs. Results: SPECTAcolor recruited 900+ patients with~900 centralized samples: 15 % biopsy and 85 % surgical specimens. 3.6 % of them were rejected due to low tumour cellularity (<30 %). Block failure rate for DNA extraction was 4.5 % (3.6 % surgical vs. 11 % biopsy samples). DNA from~800 blocks was sequenced: 524 passed, 163 pending and 105 failed.~450 NGS patient report was released via a secured web portal. NGS sample failure rate was highest during library preparation due to low amount of DNA (DNA < 100 ng: 34 % vs. DNA >200 ng: <2 %). Conclusion: A logistically complex infrastructure including qualitycontrolled HBM collection and management for next generation trials in multinational setting is feasible. Objective: The molecular alterations of pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) are not completely understood and the possible role of c-myc amplification in tumour development, progression, and prognosis has been poorly investigated. In the present study we evaluated the prognostic role of c-myc amplification and its nuclear protein expression in a series of 48 well characterized pancreatic ACCs. Method: Gene amplification was investigated using interphasic FISH analysis simultaneously hybridizing c-myc and the centromere of chromosome 8 probes (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) . Protein expression was investigated with immunohistochemistry using a specific rabbit monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Results: 6/48 (12.5 %) ACCs showed c-myc amplification and six (12.5 %) showed c-myc nuclear immunoreactivity. However, only 3 cases showed simultaneous c-myc amplification and nuclear protein expression. C-myc immunoreactivity was not associated with patient's prognosis, while c-myc amplification was statistically associated with worse prognosis (p: 0.04). Conclusion: c-myc amplification is present in about 12 % of pancreatic ACCs and identifies a subset of more aggressive neoplasms.",

Method: We analyse specimens of 24 patients with ampullary carcinoma. Molecular investigation was provided in samples containing at least 80 % of tumour tissue. Analysis was performed using two methods: Sanger sequencing (2nd exon) and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) (p.G12D \u0438p.G12V). Results: In 87.5 % of cases tumour was presented as moderatelydifferentiated adenocarcinoma; in 12,5 % cases-as well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Results of Sanger sequencing revealed KRAS-gene mutation in 33.3 % of cases (8 of 24): five of them had p.G12D and three-p.G12V. Analysis of ddPCR results revealed 10 additional mutations in an amount of 0,1-2,82 % of mutated allele. Thus, there were 75 % (18 of 24) cases with KRAS-gene mutation: 12 cases had p.G12D, 3 cases-p.G12V and 3 cases-both p.G12D and p.G12V.",

Method: Fifty two pleural effusion cases from Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung were reviewed in this study. All cases were sputum AFB positive and histopathologically showed typical Tuberculosis appearance on pleural biopsy. Results: The mean age of the patient were 39.2 years and 35 (67 %) were male. Almost all (92 %) effusions were Rivalta positive, with mean level of Lactic dehidrogenase and Glucose were 1598.4 U/L and 84.7 mg/dL consecutively. The cytological finding showed moderate to high cellularity but 3 cases (5.8 %) were hypocellular. Lymphocyte predominance was observed in 43 (82.7 %) cases. Six (11.5 %) cases were polymorphonuclear cells predominance. All cases showed scanty mesothelial cells. Proteinaceous background was found in 23 (44.2 %) cases. There were no epitheloid cells observed in all cases. Conclusion: Lymphocytes predominance and absence or scanty mesothelial cells were highly suggestive for Tuberculous pleural effusion. Cytology examination alone cannot confirm the diagnosis of Tuberculous infection. Objective: This study attempts to gain insight in polyploidy in Uveal melanoma (UM) and supplement old data with current knowledge on mutations in UM specific genes. Method: In 202 patients the ploidy status of the UM was determined using cytogenetic analysis, FISH, MLPA and/or SNP array analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the BAP1 expression and mutation analyses of BAP1 (coding regions) or the hotspots for the SF3B1, EIF1AX, GNAQ and GNA11 genes was carried out using Sanger Sequencing or Whole-Exome Sequencing. Results: Twenty-three patients had a polyploid UM (11.4 %). Polyploid tumours were larger (15.61 mm versus 13.13 mm, P = 0.004), and more often showed loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3 (P = 0.003). No difference in occurrence of mutations between polyploid and diploid tumours was observed. Polyploidy did not affect survival (P = 0.143). BAP1 mutation was the only significant independent prognostic predictor for patients with polyploid tumours, with a 16 fold increased hazard ratio (HR 15.90, P = 0.009). Conclusion: Patients with polyploid UM do not differ from diploid UM based on prevalence of mutations in the UM related genes.

Bott, E. Calomeni, G. Nadasdy, T. Nadasdy * Ohio State University, Dept. of Pathology, Columbus, USA Objective: IgA-dominant immune complex deposits (along with C3) are considered key diagnostic features in Staphylococcus infection-associated glomerulonephritis (SAGN). However recent articles have reported that Staphylococcal endocarditis associated GN may show pauci-immune pattern and positive ANCA serology, causing diagnostic overlap with ANCAassociated GN. This has important implications in regards to choice of antibiotics or immunosuppressives. Immunosuppressive therapy is essential in ANCA GN, but can be detrimental in endocarditis-associated GN. Method: We studied the immune complex pattern in detail and also presence or absence ANCA serology in our single-center cohort of 76 patients with SAGN from January 2004 to January 2016. All 76 patients had culture proven Staphylococcal infection. Results: Out of the 76 biopsies with SAGN, 27 (36 %) had focal crescents or segmental necrotizing lesions. Pauci-immune pattern on immunofluorescence (trace to weak IgA, IgG and C3 staining) with scant to absent electron dense immune-type deposits was seen in 11/76 (14 %) of the biopsies and 7 of these 11 biopsies also had crescents. Trace/scant staining for IgA was seen in up to 26 % of the biopsies. Even C3 staining was trace/scant in up to 14 % of the biopsies. One patient had all three features-focal crescents, positive ANCA serology and a pauci-immune pattern on immunofluorescence staining and ultrastructural examination. On electron microscopic examination, only 24 out of 76 (32 %) biopsies showed subepithelial humps. Conclusion: Weak to absent IgA does not preclude the diagnosis. C3 is usually present. Pauci-immune pattern of deposits and positive ANCA serology although infrequent, are potential diagnostic pitfalls in SAGN. Subepithelial humps are seen infrequently in SAGN. Objective: Similar to cutaneous melanoma, CM frequently carries activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS. We studied whether CM as well as conjunctival benign and premalignant melanocytic lesions express targets in the MAP kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways, and whether specific inhibitors affect CM growth in vitro. Method: 132 conjunctival lesions were collected from 128 patients. BRAF V600E mutation and the level of phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT was assessed by immunohistochemistry. We studied cell proliferation, phosphorylation, cell cycling and apoptosis in CM cell lines using BRAF inhibitors (Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib), MEK inhibitor (MEK162) and AKT inhibitor (MK2206). Results: BRAF V600E mutation was observed in 19 % of nevi and 26 % of melanomas, but not in primary acquired melanosis with or without atypia. Nuclear and cytoplasmic p-ERK and p-AKT were identified in all conjunctival lesions. BRAF inhibitors inhibited the cell growth of two BRAF-mutant CM cell lines, while MEK162 and MK2206 suppressed cell proliferation of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Synergistic growth inhibition and increased cell death were observed in all three cell lines when MEK162 and MK2206 were combined. Conclusion: ERK and AKT are constitutively activated in conjunctival melanocytic lesions. The co-inhibitory effect of combination treatments may benefit patients suffering from metastatic conjunctival melanoma.",

Gulcubuk Objective: To analyze whether the status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter methylation in glioblastoma (GBM) varies in different topographical portions, or during progression or recurrence. Method: Status of MGMT gene promoter methylation was analyzed in different topographical samples of 24 GBM, as well as in their eventual preceding low grade astrocytoma (LGA) and recurrences by Real Time PCR with AlphaReal MGMT kit. Data on immunohistochemical expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutated protein (IDH1-R132H), p53 and Ki-67, overall survival and post-surgical treatment were available in all the cases. Results: MGMT gene promoter was homogeneously unmethylated in 13 GBMs and methylated in 8. 3/24 GBMs were heterogeneous, with MGMT promoter methylated in the inner portion of the tumour and unmethylated in the intermediate and outer portions. Conversion from unmethylated to methylated MGMT status was seen in 2/2 GBMs originated from progression of LGA. Methylation status changed in 3/12 (25 %) GBMs at recurrence. Overall survival was longer than 36 months in all patients with MGMT methylated and IDH1 mutated GBM. Conclusion: MGMT methylation status may be heterogeneous through GBM samples, and between GBM and its recurrence. Methylation may be acquired during progression from LGA and it is prognostically significant in tumours with IDH1 mutation.",

We purpose here the development shedule of TS l\u00e9sions constitution. Method: We analysed 12 fetal and perinatal brains (from 21 GW until 3 days after birth) with TSC lesions. For each patient we considered: 1) the type of cell lesion 2) their nature (using both glial and neuronal markers) 3) their cytoarchitectural and 3) spatial organization. Results: We identified 3 types of TSC Cells (b cells, balloon cells (BC) and dysplastic giant neurons (DN) and 3 types of cytoarchitectonics (A and B cocards, cortical tubers). Cells were characterized using neuronal and glial markers. While b cells were exclusively neuronal, balloon cells could be both, the glial ones being proeminent and appearing earlier during pregnancy. DN and cortical tubers are respectively observed are observed after 25GW and 30GW. Type A cocard remained located on periventricular area while type B cocarde evolved with age and progressively occupied more superficial white matter areas. Both contained glial and neuronal BC. Cortical BC are firstly observed at 25GW on layer I, and were present in all layers after 30GW. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that in fetal brain TSC lesions evolved progressively following distinct patterns according to their location or the TSC cell nature. Objective: To determine the prognostic value of invasive cribriform and intraductal carcinoma in pre-treatment biopsies on time to diseasespecific death. Method: We pathologically revised the diagnostic biopsies of 1031 patients from the first screening round of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer 1993 Cancer -2000 . The median follow-up was 13 years. Patients who either had invasive cribriform growth pattern or intraductal carcinoma were categorized as CR/IDC+. The outcome was disease-specific survival. Relationships with outcome were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression and log-rank analysis. Results: In total, 486 patients had Gleason score 6 (47 %) and 545 had \u22657 (53 %). The 15-year disease-specific-survival probabilities were 99 % in Gleason score 6 (n = 486), 94 % in CR/IDC-Gleason score \u22657 (n = 356) and 67 % in CR/IDC+ Gleason score \u22657 (n = 189). CR/IDC-Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 patients did not have statistically different survival probabilities from those with Gleason score 6 (P = .30), while CR/IDC+ Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 patients did (P < .001). In multivariable analysis CR/IDC+ status was independently associated with a poorer disease-specific survival (HR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.4-4.8, P = .002). We conclude that CR/ IDC+ status in prostate cancer biopsies is associated with a worse disease-specific survival. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that men with biopsy CR/IDC-Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer could be candidates for active surveillance, as these patients had similar survival probabilities to those with Gleason score 6.",

Method: Twenty-three genitourinary pathologists participated in the evaluation of 60 selected high-magnification photographs. The selection included 10 cases of Gleason grade 3, 40 Gleason grade 4 (10 per growth pattern) and 10 Gleason grade 5. Participants were asked to select a single predominant Gleason grade per case (3, 4, 5) and to indicate the predominant Gleason grade 4 growth pattern if present. \"Consensus\" was defined as at least 80 % agreement and \"favoured\" as 60-80 % agreement. Results: Consensus on Gleason grading was reached in 47/60 (78 %) cases, 35 of which were assigned a grade 4. In the 13 non-consensus cases, ill-formed (6/13, 46 %) and fused (7/13, 54 %) patterns were involved in disagreement. Among the 20 cases where at least 1 pathologist assigned the ill-formed growth pattern none (0 %, 0/20) reached consensus. Consensus for fused, cribriform and glomeruloid glands was reached in 2, 23, and 38 %, respectively. In 9/35 (26 %) consensus Gleason grade 4 cases, participants disagreed on growth pattern. Six of these were characterized by large epithelial proliferations with delicate intervening fibro-vascular cores, which were alternately given fused or cribriform growth pattern (\"complex fused\"). Conclusion: Consensus on Gleason grade 4 growth pattern was predominantly reached on cribriform and glomeruloid patterns, but rarely on illformed and fused glands. The complex fused glands seem to be a borderline pattern of unknown prognostic significance on which a consensus could not be reached. Method: BR was considered as PSA >0.2 ng/mL. LRC was considered as being clinical stage T1c, stage pT2, needle and pathologic Gleason score <6, and preoperative PSA <10 ng/mL. Results: From a cohort of 506 consecutive RPs, 62/506 (12.3 %) patients were free of BR more than 8 years after RP (mean 10 years, range 8-14 years). From these 62 patients, 14/62 (22.6 %) had criteria for LRC. Comparing our criteria for LRC with Epstein's, the only significant discrepancy was related to PSA density. From the total of 14 patients with criteria for LRC, 9/14 (64.3 %) had PSA density >0.15. Conclusion: From a total of 62 patients without BR more than 8 years following RP, 14/62 (22.6 %) patients had criteria for LRC. These patients might have been suitable for AS instead of RP. Comparing our criteria of LRC with Epstein's criteria, a significant discrepancy was related to PSA density. The majority of patients had PSA density >0.15 and would not be enrolled for AS.",

The main goal of this project was to study the mechanisms by which \u0394Np63 loss triggers tumour progression to muscle invasive disease. Method: We generated specific \u0394Np63 Knock-down cell lines (sh\u0394) in RT112 and BFTC NMIBC lines and gene expression and in vitro and in vivo functional experiments were performed. Results: We observed that RT112_sh\u0394 and BFTC_sh\u0394 cells showed higher proliferation rate both in vitro and in vivo as well as increased colony formation activity when compared to parental cells. Furthermore, they displayed superior invasion capacity in vitro, which correlated with higher local tumour initiation and metastatic potential in the in vivo bladder orthotopic mouse model. Gene expression analyses revealed that there were nine commonly upregulated (AGR2, CAPS, CHD2, GCHFR, HOXC6, HRK, LRRC26, SORBS2 and S100A4) and four commonly downregulated (EPDR1, PPARG, SCML1 and SPOCK1) genes amongst both experimental cell lines. Functional studies to assess which genetic pathways are critical for tumour progression subsequent to \u0394Np63 loss are further being pursued. Conclusion: Our findings may be able to identify high-risk patients who could benefit from early radical cystectomy to prevent tumour progression, as well as low-risk patients who could benefit from more spaced follow-up visits. Also, they may unlock the opportunity of identifying new therapeutic strategies to target previously understudied pathways in HG-NMIBC, therefore avoiding progression to more aggressive disease.",

Results: There were 283 BCR (19 %) and 36 MET (2.4 %) events, at a mean of 36 and 80 months post-RP, respectively. Most patients had GG2 tumours (58 %), but few had GG3 tumours (3.5 %). No GG1 patient developed MET. Two percent of unmodified GG2 and GG3 tumours, and 0.5 % of modified GG2 and GG3 developed MET (p = 0.02). GG5 tumours had a significantly higher risk for BCR (p < 0.0001), but there was no difference in unmodified GG1-GG4. Modified GG1-2, GG3-4, and GG5 separated clearly into 3 worsening prognostic groups (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: As a predictor of MET and BCR, the use of the tertiary pattern is superior to GG grading without tertiary pattern. Objective: To investigate the expression of p63 and \u03b2-catenin in urothelial bladder cancer (UBC), assess the significance of their coexpression, and evaluate their prognostic value. Method: We analyzed the expression of \u03b2-catenin and p63 by double staining immunohistochemistry in 633 cases of UBC included in tissuemicroarrays. Expression status was correlated with clinicopathological and follow-up data. Results: Low p63 expression, observed in 255 (40.3 %) tumours, was significantly associated with high grade, and pathologic stage (p < 0.001, respectively). In pT1 UBC (N = 292), p63 correlated with variant differentiation (p = 0.048). Reduced/absent \u03b2-catenin immunoreactivity (82.3 %) correlated to high grade and stage (p < 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively), and strongly correlated with impaired p63 staining (p < 0.001). Loss of both markers was linked to cancer specific death (p < 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). High p63 was associated with better overall survival (P < 0.001), while preserved \u03b2-catenin correlated with longer recurrence-free survival (p = 0.017). Simultaneous decrease/loss of immunoreactivity of both markers was a strong predictor of poor survival (p < 0.001). In Cox regression analysis decrease of \u03b2-catenin was independent predictor of recurrence. Conclusion: Coexpression of \u03b2-catenin and p63 in UBC predicts better survival of the patients and may serve as potential prognostic tool for improvement of risk stratification and therapy decision-making in UBC, especially in early invasive bladder cancer. Results: 337 FPSS were included. 305 (91 %) FPSS showed no or minor skeletal malformations. 14 (4.2 %) FPSS had major skeletal malformations. In 18 (5.3 %) cases the diagnosis was based on the pathognomonic skeletal malformations on the FPSS. Two cases were false positive after major birth trauma. The presence of multiple skeletal malformations on prenatal ultrasound or at post-mortem external inspection was highly indicative of a diagnostic FPSS (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The majority of the babygrams/FPSS has no contribution to the diagnostic process. Multiple skeletal malformations on prenatal ultrasound or post-mortem external inspection are indicative for a diagnostic FPSS, and this should be the main selection criterion.",

Method: First, a series of 12 neuroblastomas showing morphological heterogeneity were identified by the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Committee. All of those tumours were composed of 2 clearly distinct histology areas. Then genetic intratumoural heterogeneity was analyzed by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method FISH performed in this study tested (1) MYCN genomic status using a MYCN probe in 2p24 and a reference DNA probe Laf (2q11), and (2) Gene rearrangements (gain) using a Dual Fusion Probe containing a mixture of two probes for PML gene (15q22) and RARA gene (17q21.1). Results: The first FISH analysis with MYCN and Laf probes demonstrated genetic difference between the two morphologically distinct components for 10 of 12 cases: namely one component showed disomy and the other had polysomy/gain. None of 24 components in this series had amplified MYCN. The second FISH analysis also demonstrated difference of 17q21.1 status between the two components for 11 of 12 cases.

Tw o gynaecopathologists, blinded for molecular features, evaluated each case (\u22653 slides) for 15 histological characteristics. Results: POLE EDMs were associated with high grade (P < 0.01), but not with serous-like features (P = 0.336). Tumour giant cells and peritumoural lymphocytes strongly associated with POLE EDMs compared to combined MSI and MSS ECs (both P < 0.01).

A trend for POLE-mutant ECs was seen towards a pushing border invasion-type (P = 0.056). Conclusion: POLE-mutant ECs distinguish themselves from other molecular subgroups and serous cancers by a combination of endometrioid morphology, high grade, tumour giant cells and prominent immune infiltrate. Use of these histopathological features will assist pre-screening of POLE EDMs, facilitating implementation of this prognostic marker in routine pathology.",

Method: A case control study conducted in four maternity and infertility centers in Khartoum State, Sudan. Cervical smears were stained with Pap stain and the results were reported using the revised Bethesda System. Results: Out of 230 cervical smears (165 from infertile and 165 from fertile women aged 15-45 years), 22(13.33 %) of the infertile and 16 (9.69 %) of the fertile women showed abnormal epithelial changes: low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (9/22), high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) (7/22), atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (3/22), atypical glandular cells (2/22), and squamous cell carcinoma (1/22) , while in the control group these types were 9, 1, 2, 3 and 1, respectively. The cervical smears from the studied infertile and fertile women showed significantly different results (P = 0.013 < 0.05). Conclusion: Cervical smears from infertile women are significantly associated with cytomorphlogical changes particularly of HSIL. The study recommends integration of cervical cancer screening programme in primary health care services. The findings in the cohort of infertile women suggest this group as a potential risk group for HSIL but this needs verification in large scale studies. Objective: Endometrial cancers (ECs) carrying POLE exonuclease domain mutations (EDMs) define an ultramutated, highly immunogenic subset of ECs with an excellent prognosis. Because it is unknown whether POLE EDMs are initiating carcinogenesis, we analysed endometrial intraepithelial neoplasias (EINs) adjacent to POLE-mutant ECs. Method: ECs with proven POLE EDMs (n = 70) were evaluated for the presence of adjacent EIN. Four EINs were identified by two independent pathologists. Of one patient, also a positive lymph node was available. DNA was isolated by microdissection and subjected to Sanger sequencing to detect the POLE mutation. One EIN was screened for CTNNB1 mutations using Sanger sequencing as this was identified in the corresponding carcinoma. Slides were immunohistochemically stained for CD8. Results: Three EINs carried the same heterozygous somatic POLE EDM as the corresponding carcinomas. In one case, the POLE EDM was also present in a positive lymph node. For one cancer containing a CTNNB1 mutation, the EIN was CTNNB1-wildtype. Both EINs and carcinomas demonstrated pronounced CD8+ lymphocytic infiltrates. Conclusion: POLE EDMs are found in precursor-and in metastatic lesions in EC. Its occurrence prior to another frequently mutated oncogene suggests POLE EDM as an early and perhaps initiating event in carcinogenesis.",

Ponce, X. Gonzalez Tallada, B. Pardo, M. Gil Mart\u00edn, E. Ortega, X. Matias Guiu Method: 222 HGSOC sections with known germline BRCA status were stained by in situ hybridization using a DNP-19q12 probe containing both CCNE1 and URI1, and immunohistochemistry for cyclin E1 and URI1. Results: 19q12 was amplified in 18.5 % of cases, of which 53.7 % highly expressed both cyclin E1 and URI1. There was significant correlation between 19q12 amplification and cyclin E1 (p < 0.0001) and URI (p < 0.006) expression; and between cyclin E1 and URI1 (p < 0.0001). 19q12 amplification, high cyclin E1 or URI1 high expression were each associated with poor overall survival (p = 0.028, p = 0.021, p = 0.039, respectively) and were mutually exclusive of germline BRCA1 mutations (p = 0.035, p = 0.031, p < 0.0001 respectively. Conclusion: The frequent co-occurrence of 19q12 amplification, cyclin E1 and URI1 high expression and their mutual exclusivity with BRCA1 mutations suggest that cells giving rise to this tumour type require a cooperation of a proliferative signal (cyclin E1) and a pro-survival factor (URI1) and an intact DNA repair mechanism (BRCA) in tumourigenesis. (2)evaluate their prognostic value as biomarkers; (3)assess eventual differences of ICI in HPVrelated SCC. Method: LVIN(21), HVIN(45) and SCC(44) retrospective cases from AC-Camargo-Cancer-Center, Brazil, between 1980 and 2013. H&E slides were reviewed by expert pathologists. Peri/intratumoural hotspots were evaluated. ICI characterization was accomplished by morphology and immunohistochemistry (anti-CD3/SP7, CD4/EPR685, CD8/ EP1150Y, CD20/EP459Yand FOXP3/Poly). HPV was assessed by linear array. Quantification by HSCORE of ICI was performed by APERIO\u00ae system. Statistics data were calculated considering p < 0.05. Kaplan-Meier curves were based on Log-Rank test. Results: Most ICI showed moderate/intense plasmocytes/lymphocytes count (P2L13/21-LVIN, P9L35/45-HVIN, P18L44/44-SCC). ICI showed progressively increased expression of CD3, CD8 and FOXP3 in peritumoural ICI in SCC>HVIN>LVIN (p < 0.0001). CD4 show reduced expression in SCC<HVIN<LVIN (p < 0.0001). ICI showed reduction in peri/intratumoural CD4 expression (p = 0.007/p = 0.048) and increase in intratumoural CD8 expression (p = 0.035). Conclusion: (1)ICI showed total plasmocytes and T lymphocytes count, CD8+/CD4+ ratio and FOXP3 expression progressively increased in SCC>HVIN>LVIN; (2)patients with SCC associated to intratumoural T lymphocytes and peritumoural T lymphocytes expressing FOXP3 had prolonged disease-free survival; (3)there was association between HPV and increased CD8+/CD4+ ratio intratumoural T lymphocytes in HPVrelated SCC.",

Method: Cases of USC with complete tubal examination were prospectively collected and reviewed for presence of tubal involvement. Immunohistochemistry for p53 and WT1 was performed on endometrial and tubal components in cases with tubal involvement. Results: Of 161 USC cases, 32 (19.9 %) showed tubal involvement (unilateral: n = 19, bilateral: n = 13). Patients with tubal manifestations were older, and there were higher rates of deep myometrial and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) compared to cases without. Tubal fimbriae were involved in 16/32 cases. Tubal tumours were mucosal in 28/32, mural in 14/32, serosal in 3/32, invasive in 22/32 cases, and showed LVI in 15/32. STIC-like features were seen in 16/32 cases. Immunostaining showed complete concordance of p53 and WT1 between endometrial and tubal tumours in 23/28 cases, the majority being WT1 negative or only focally positive (19/23), and all being p53 mutant. Conclusion: Tubal involvement is detected in one-fifth of USC. Although STIC-like features might suggest tubal origin in half of these, our study shows that tubal manifestations represent intramucosal metastasis from USC in most cases.",

Method: The diagnostic records of PCD patients were reviewed and data on TEM were compared with the emerging results from the recent molecular genetic tests performed in our department. Results: 30 PCD patients have been diagnosed in our centre since 1998. TEM analysis revealed a combined ODA and IDA defect in 43 % and an ODA defect in 10 % of the patients. Normal ultrastructure (NU) was identified in 34 % of the patients while the remaining presented other defects. Sixty percent of patients with NU carried a mutated DNAH11 gene and all patients with an ODA defect carried a mutated DNAH5 gene. Conclusion: Among the 30 PCD genes, only mutations in DNAH11 are associated with a NU. Mutation in other genes, such as RSPH4A (radial spokes) and CCDC164 (nexin links), cause subtle morphological defects that may missed by TEM. However, TEM remains a useful tool for PCD diagnosis as it can guide genetic testing through the identification of specific ultrastructural defects.",

Results: Overall, 3066 patients were included in this study. Histotype was different between young (<65 years) and elderly (>65 years) patients (p < 0.001). Patients over the age of 65 years were more often diagnosed with high-stage ESTS and an increasing proportion of high-grade ESTS (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients who received no treatment increased with age and the elderly received fewer combined modality treatments. Age was significantly associated with relative 5-year survival (72.7 % for younger patients and 43.8 % for the oldest elderly (>85 years)). In multivariable analysis, age still remained a significant prognostic factor.

Unfortunately ACL reconstruction using extrasynovial tendon autografts is inadequate due to poor integration. Our hypothesis is that intrasynovial tendon grafts might be more suitable in ACL reconstruction. Method: This preliminary study included 10 adult male New Zealand white rabbits, divided into two groups of 5 animals (A and B). In both groups there was an ACL reconstruction using an autologous tendon graft; extrasynovial for group A (extensors digitorum of the foot) and intrasynovial for group B (flexor digitorum profundus). The animals were sacrificed 6 weeks postoperatively and specimens from the knee were obtained for histopathological examination. The specimens were fixed in formalin, decalcified in nitrous oxide and embedded in paraffin. Results: H/E sections showed that there was better integration in group B than in group A. The integration of the graft was evaluated through the presence of incipient calcification of the tendon and the absence of necrosis or foreign-body reaction at the graft-cartilage junction. Furthermore, during the sacrifice the intrasynovial graft had better hue than the extrasynovial graft. Conclusion: Intrasynovial autografts seem to be promising for ACL reconstruction, though further research is needed.",

In spite numerous publications concerning clinical, epidemiological and virological aspects of the problem many questions related to histopathology remain unclear. Method: In 28 autopsy cases of occult hepatitis nearby analysis of usual clinical, laboratory, macroscopical and histopathological data has been provided immunohistochemical (IHC) study with sera against HBsAg and HBcAg. Results: All the patients had typical for CVHB clinical and biochemical symptoms. Macroscopical and microscopical picture was characteristic for HVHB in cirrhotic stage. Among the histopathological findings we paid special attention to nuclear polymorphism and inclusions which are considered to typical for HVHB. In 10 cases was positive reaction with sera against HBsAg and in 5 of them HBcAg was revealed as well. In additional 7 cases we have found slightly expressed (+/\u2212) reaction with HBsAg. Conclusion: 1) Absence of HBsAg in blood doesn't exclude death threaten course of CHVB. 2) Morphological picture of occult hepatitis is comparable with classic one. 3) Pathogenic mechanisms of the disease needs further complex studies.",

We intended to characterize the clinicopathological features of EBVaGCs and evaluate its impact as prognostic marker. This is the first study to characterize EBVaGC in Portugal. Method: 133 consecutive patients (81M&52F; mean age 64) submitted to gastrectomy during 2011 at IPO-Porto were evaluated. EBV presence was tested with in situ hybridization (ISH) targeting EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER-ISH). Statistical analysis was performed according to clinicopathological data. Results: EBVaGCs represent 6.8 % of all GC cases. EBV was present in 7.2 %(5/69) of tubular adenocarcinomas, 11.1 %(2/18) of mixed type and 100 %(2/2) of medullary carcinomas; EBV was absent in poorly cohesive carcinomas. EBVaGC are more frequent in gastric body and antrum. Patients with infiltrative carcinomas, lymphovascular and perineural invasion had significantly reduced survival (p < 0.001); EBVaGC patients had better survival. Conclusion: 6.8 % of GC cases are EBV-associated. Despite some similarities, our study showed different clinicopathological features when compared with previous studies, mainly the absence of EBV in poorly cohesive carcinomas. The tumour infiltrative growth pattern and the presence of lymphovascular and perineural invasion are independent predictor factors of poor survival in GC patients.",

ES shows early metastatic dissemination, and generalized disease is associated with poor prognosis in ES patients. It has previously been shown that expression of the EWS/FLI oncogene is associated with dysregulated actin reorganization in ES cells; however, the impact of EWS/FLI on ES cell adhesion and migration as a prerequisite for metastasis has so far not been investigated. Method: Various ES cell lines including a stably transfected EWS/FLI knock-down line were used to investigate the impact of EWS/FLI expression on cell morphology and kinase signalling in ES cells by immunofluorescence microscopy and western immunoblotting. Cell adhesion and migration assays were performed in real-time using the xCelligence platform. Results: EWS/FLI expression decreases filopodial outgrowth and cell adhesion and enhances motility of ES cells. EWS/FLI knockdown decreases mitogen-associated protein (MAP) and p70S6 Kinase signalling that have both been shown to regulate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity as well as protein composition of focal adhesion complexes. Conclusion: Our results indicate that EWS/FLI enhances invasive properties of ES cells via dysregulation of MAPK and p70S6K signalling, leading to altered composition and activity of focal adhesion complexes. Since both pathways are possible targets for inhibitors that are already in clinical use, the results point towards a possible role for kinase inhibitors to prevent metastatic dissemination of ES cells.",

Racanelli, R. A. Trevisan Pereira * University of Campinas, Pathology, FCM, Brazil Objective: After stimulation by photons, fluorophores will remain for a short period \"excited\", called lifetime, and then drop to their ground state emitting fluorescence. Lifetime can be used to create virtual fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) pictures, where the contrast is created by artificial colours attributed to different lifetime ranges. The aim of the study was to apply this technique to the detection of infectious agents in human material. Method: Fresh material or unstained cytologic or histologic preparations were examined from 30 patients with infections by toxoplasma, trypanosoma, aspergilllus, cryptococcus, enterobius, gi\u00e1rdia, strongyloides or schistosoma species. FLIM images were created by a confocal microscope using a pulsed laser at 405 nm, and a time-correlated single-photon counting equipment. Results: This technique showed precisely morphologic details, generally superior to that seen in usual special stains. Lifetimes of infectious agents were often different from those of human tissues thus enabeling their rapid and easy detection. Signal intensity was usually higher in fresh or formalin-fixed material than in histologic sections, due to the loss of intracytoplasmatic fluophores during the embedding process. Objective: We sought to characterize the clinicopathological features of SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcomas (SMARCA4-DTS), a sarcoma subtype recently identified through combined next generation and pathological screenings. Method: We retrieved 49 cases of thoracic malignancies from our consultation cases suspicious for SMARCA4-DTS (including 12 cases of the initial paper). Pathological review was performed by pathologists experts in soft tissue and thoracic pathology fields. Genomic profiling (oncoscan, Affymetrix platform) and SMARCA4 sequencing (Illumina, Miseq platform) were performed when material was available. Results: Thirty cases were finally classified as SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcomas. Patient's median age and survival were respectively of 42 years old and 8 months. Tumours were located in mediastinum (n = 13), mediastinopulmonary (n = 7), pleura (n = 10). Morphologically, tumours were composed of sheets of epithelioid cells dotted with vesicular monomorphic nuclei. By immunohistochemistry, they expressed consistently CD34, AE1/E3 and/or EMA and SOX2. SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 were lost in all cases. All cases displayed complex genetic profiles and SMARCA4 inactivating mutations. Differential diagnoses included SMARCA4-inactivated lung carcinoma (n = 5), midline NUT carcinoma (n = 3), SMARCB1-deficient rhabdoid tumour (n = 3), Ewinglike sarcomas with CIC rearrangement (n = 3) rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1) and unclassified sarcoma (n = 2). Conclusion: This first clinicopathological series of SMARCA4-DTS highlights these tumours can be reliably diagnosed in routine practice. They represent aggressive malignancies which should be recognized as patients are therapeutically benefit from EZH2 inhibitors. Objective: Liquid-based fine needle aspiration (LB-FNA) is widely recognized as a reliable diagnostic method to evaluate thyroid nodules. Use of molecular biomarkers has been proposed to improve pathologic accuracy. Recently TERT promoter mutations were associated with aggressive thyroid cancers. Method: We evaluated feasibility and performance of mutation profiling of BRAF, NRAS, HRAS and TERT on residual material from LB-FNA in a prospective cohort of 649 cases including 245 atypia of undetermined significance (AUS), 219 follicular neoplasms (FN), 97 suspicious for malignancy (SM), and 88 malignant (M) . Results: Overall 159 cases (24.5 %) were mutated: 92 BRAF, 50 NRAS, 16 HRAS and 9 TERT mutations. Surgical samples were available for 319 cases. In the AUS category, 10/18 malignant cases were mutated vs Wednesday, 28 September 2016, 17.15-19.15 , Conference Room 1-2 OFP-11 Joint Session: Endocrine Pathology / Head and Neck Pathology 9/42 benign cases (p = 0.014). In the FN category, 5/16 malignant cases were mutated vs 8/104 benign cases (p = 0.016). In the SM group, 28/61 malignant samples were mutated versus 0/11 benign cases (p = 0.005). Finally in the M group, all samples were malignant with 52/67 mutated cases. Importantly TERT mutations were present in 8 cases (2 FN, 1 SM and 5 M) all confirmed to be malignant (p = 0.008). Conclusion: Mutation profiling can be successfully performed on residual material of thyroid LB-FNA and may help to improve the diagnostic accuracy of FNA. TERT mutation is rare but associated with malignancy, and as so should be systematically tested. Objective: To investigate prevalence of high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection in sinonasal carcinomas. Method: Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction, detecting p16 expression and presence of HPV DNA and HPV E6/E7 mRNA, were used. Results: The study comprised 47 males and 26 females, aged 23-83 years (median 62 years). Fifty-three percent tumours arose in nasal cavity, 42 % in maxillary sinus, and 5 % within ethmoid complex. Forty-nine tumours were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Follow-up period ranged 1-241 months (median 19 months). A total of 18/73 (25 %) tumours were HPV-positive (17 SCCs and 1 small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma). Types HPV16, HPV18, and HPV35 were detected. There was strong correlation between HPV status and p16 expression (p < 0.005). HPVpositive SCCs occurred more frequently in smokers (p = 0.04), were more frequently p16-positive (p < 0.0001), and were non-keratinizing (p = 0.02), the latter occurring more commonly in nasal cavity (p = 0.03). Median survival for HPV-positive SCC patients was 30 months, while for HPV-negative SCC patients was 14 months (p = 0.23). Conclusion: HR-HPV are actively involved in etiopathogenesis of a subset of sinonasal SCCs. p16 may be used as surrogate marker for determination of HPV status in sinonasal carcinomas.",

In this study we have investigated the prognostic value of FGFR1 expression in HNSCC and the therapeutic relevance of targeting FGFR with AZD4547. Method: Immunohistochemistry was applied on tissue microarrays to investigate FGFR1 protein expression in 452 HNSCC. Sensitivity of HNSCC cell lines to AZD4547, either as single or combination treatment with EGFR-inhibitor gefitinib, was assessed using long-term colony formation assays, short-term viability assays, and biochemical analysis. Results: FGFR1 protein was overexpressed in 82 % of HPV-positive and 75 % of HPV-negative HNSCC. Overexpression was related to poor survival in HPV-negative HNSCC (HR: 3.07; 95 % CI: 1.74-6.90; P = 0.001). Treatment of high FGFR1 expressing cell line CCL30 with AZD4547 reduced cell proliferation and FGFR signaling. Cell lines SCC147 and BICR16 were resistant to AZD4547 treatment due to EGFR signaling. Combined AZD4547 and gefitinib treatment synergistically inhibited proliferation of resistant cell lines. Conclusion: Here we identify high FGFR1 expression as a candidate prognostic biomarker in HPV-negative HNSCC. Furthermore, we provide a rationale for treating FGFR1-expressing HNSCC with FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 and for combining AZD4547 and gefitinib in FGFR inhibitor resistant HNSCC. Objective: Assessing promoter hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes in nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) in relation to clinicopathological features. Method: Methylation status of 23 tumour suppressor genes were assessed in 108 NPCs using methylation-specific multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification. Correlation between methylation, clinicopathological features and survival were examined. Results: Hypermethylation of RASSF1A and ESR1 was significantly more frequent in EBV positive NPC, while hypermethylation of DAPK1 was more frequent in EBV negative NPC. In logistic regression RASSF1 (p = 0.049), with RASSF1 being more frequent in EBV positive NPC, remained significant. In EBV positive NPC, RASSF1A (p = 0.035) predicted worse overall survival (OS) (HR 3.044, 95 % CI 1.022-9.068, p = 0.046). In EBV negative NPCs, APC predicted worse disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 6.868, 95 % CI 2.142-22.022, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Important epigenetic differences exist between EBV negative and EBV positive NPC, with EBV negative NPCs having a more similar hypermethylation profile to other HNSCC than EBV positive NPCs. Hypermethylation of RASSF1A seems to be an independent predictor of worse OS in EBV positive NPC, and may be important in the pathogenesis of EBV infected NPC. Hypermethylation of APC may be an independent predictor of worse DFS in EBV negative NPCs. Objective: Papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) are known to have an excellent survival rate. However, it remains difficult to predict which patients need to be monitored more closely due to an increased risk of tumour relapse. Method: PTCs of 125 patients including 57 patients with an adverse outcome were immunohistochemically stained for PTEN, VEGF-A, p27, Galectin-3, HBME-1, Thyroglobulin and the Androgen Receptor. Forty-four of those tumours underwent miRNA profiling and the results were examined in the light of tall cell morphology, a phenotype known for its more aggressive behavior. Results: Univariate analysis showed a signification correlation between relapse free survival and an altered expressions for PTEN, p27, Galcetin-3, VEGF-A and Thyroglobulin. In multivariate analysis including tall cells as a confounder, only reduced expression of PTEN and an increased expression of VEGF-A correlated significantly with a shorter relapse free survival. MiR-362-3p and miR-155-5p were identified as targets for VEGF-A and miR-222-3p and miR-17-5p for PTEN. Three of these four miRNAs harbor significant prognostic patient information as well. Conclusion: PTEN and VEGF-A can predict patient outcome independent from tall cell morphology, age, stage and gender. Several identified miRNAs may be responsible for this observation.",

Botryoid-type embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (bERMS), multinodular goiter (MNG) and thyroid carcinoma (TC) are emerging phenotypes. We report a case of a 12-year-old girl with the aforementioned conditions. Method: The patient underwent total thyroidectomy for bilateral, multiple nodules, detected by routine ultrasound examination. She had a bERMS of the cervix at the age of 7, treated by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. There was a family history of thyroid pathology. Results: FNAB of two nodules revealed a colloid nodule (Bethesda II) and a follicular neoplasm (Bethesda IV). The thyroid gland was enlarged and multinodular (61 g). Besides numerous encapsulated nodules with variable degrees of cellularity and brisk mitotic activity (maximum 18/10 HPF) there was one, larger than the others (2.1 cm), displaying capsular and vascular invasion. This tumour showed nuclei of the \"intermediate type\" and was thus classified as Well Differentiated TC, not otherwise specified. Molecular testing for BRAF, NRAS and TERT promoter did not reveal any mutation. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the malignant potential of MNG in the setting of DICER1 syndrome and highlights the need to understand this peculiar carcinogenic process that does not fit with the classic division in papillary and follicular TC. Objective: To correlate the mutational profile with clinical and pathological characteristics in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Method: Targeted next-generation sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) analyses for 18 genes most frequently altered in ACC were performed in a series of 62 cases (including 10 with matched primary and metastatic/recurrence samples) and correlated with major clinical and pathological characteristics of tumours. Results: A total of 433 somatic deleterious genetic alterations (328 gene mutations and 105 CNV) were identified in 57/62 cases, the remaining five being wild-type for all genes tested. TERT, CDK4, ZNRF3 and RB1 were altered in more than 30 % of cases. The genotype was significantly different among histological variants, with the lowest mutation burden in the oncocytic one (p = 0.006) and the highest prevalence of RB1 (p = 0.001) and CDK4 (p = 0.002) in the conventional and myxoid ones, respectively. None of the 10 cases with matched samples showed a stable genotype along tumour progression. Among individual genes, TP53 mutations were associated with high Ki-67 index, high tumour stage and aggressive disease status (all p < 0.02). Conclusion: The genomic signature in ACC is unstable along tumour progression and differs among histological variants; moreover, TP53 mutations represent the most relevant prognostic molecular marker.",

Method: miR-100a expression was analyzed by means of real-time PCR in 92 lung carcinoids and compared with mTOR mRNA expression, as well as with major clinical and pathological parameters. In vivo, the effect of miR-100a silencing on the responsiveness to mTOR inhibitors was assessed in typical carcinoid H727 cells. Results: miR-100a was inversely correlated with mTOR mRNA expression (p < 0.0001), supporting its effect in the negative regulation of mTOR pathway in lung carcinoids, in vivo. Moreover, high miR-100a expression was associated with aggressive features (atypical histotype, high clinical stage, vascular invasion and aggressive disease status; all p < 0.05) and with shorter survival at univariate analysis (HR 4.5, p = 0.013). Silencing of miR-100a in H727 cells significantly increased mTOR mRNA expression and sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, in vitro. Conclusion: miR-100a actively participates to the regulation of mTOR expression in vivo and in vitro, and represents a novel candidate prognostic biomarker in lung carcinoids; moreover, repression of its expression is associated to increased responsiveness to mTOR inhibitors and might represent a novel tool to sensitize lung carcinoid cells to these target agents. Objective: The diagnosis of spindle cell squamous carcinoma (SCSC) of the larynx is challenging, because the conventional SCSC component, may be limited and difficult to recognize. Infact lesions with a prominent inflammatory infiltrate and reactive vessels, may have a granulation tissue-like appearance, like post-intubation granulomas or inflammatory pseudotumours. We analysed the clinico-pathological features of a group of laryngeal SCSC with granulation tissue-like appearance. Method: All cases of SCSC between 1996 and 2015 were reviewed and tumours with a inflammatory infiltrate and abundant capillary vessels were selected. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins AE1/AE3, CAM5.2 and 5/6, as well as for p63, p40 and ALK1 were performed. Ten cases of true granulation tissue were controls. Results: Five cases of granulation tissue-like SCSC were identified. Patients were males, 57-65 years. All lesions consisted of a ulcerated polypoid proliferation of atypical spindle cells, with a minor component of conventional invasive or in situ squamous carcinoma. The spindle cells expressed AE1/AE3 or CAM5.2, while cytokeratin 5/6, p63 and p40 were positive only in the conventional squamous component. ALK1 was negative. Conclusion: The diagnosis of granulation tissue-like SCSC is challenging due to the clinical and histological overlap with benign conditions. The use of an immunohistochemical panel is recommended.",

The two remaining cases were in the humerus and femur. Data regarding the objective were obtained from medical and pathological records. Results: All patients were female with a mean age of 36 years (range, 21-56) . Microscopically, the tumour was composed of large epithelioid cells with prominent nucleolus and scattered giant multinucleated cells. The predominant growth pattern was sheet-like. Cord, rosette-like structures and hemangiopericitoid pattern were also observed. Osteoid was found. Cytokeratins were negative. Despite treatment with systemic chemotherapy and surgery the disease progressed and the patients died. Conclusion: Epithelioid osteosarcoma is a rare aggressive variant. Differential diagnosis includes small cell-type osteosarcoma, metastatic neuroblastoma, PNET, metastatic carcinoma and malignant neoplasias with epithelioid characteristics. The osteoid formation by neoplastic cells is the most important key. The usual treatment consists in preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery. It has been predominantly reported in the long bones of young people and only few cases have been reported in the jawbones, therefore more studies are required.",

Method: We selected 100 consecutive patients with MCL and 151 blood donors as controls. Genotyping for rs2069762, rs6822844 (IL2), rs1800872, rs1800890 and rs3024491 (IL10) was performed using Taqman\u00ae Openarray\u00ae technology. Paraffin-embedded tumour tissue was submitted to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD68, CD163, iNOS, FOXP3, IL2 and IL10. Slides were analyzed using the Aperio\u00ae system. Results: A higher frequency of IL10 AGA haplotype was found in MCL patients as compared to controls (p = 0.06 after correction for multiple comparisons). AA genotypes of both rs2069762 and rs3024491 were independently associated with unfavorable overall (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) and event-free survivals (p = 0.03 and p = 0.06, respectively). Patients carrying rs3024491 AA genotype showed increased levels of FOXP3 (p = 0.06) and iNOS-positive macrophages (p = 0.01) in tumour biopsies. Neither IL2 nor IL10 expression seemed modulated by the respective SNPs. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a 3-SNP haplotype in IL10 might predispose to MCL. Moreover, the AA genotype of rs3024491 may increase T-reg lymphocyte and cytotoxic macrophage levels in MCL. Finally, both rs3024491 and rs6822844 are independently associated with unfavorable prognosis in this lymphoma.",

When stratified by original diagnosis PL Showed poor OAS/ overall survival but using the revised definition a significant better survival of PL as compared to the gray zone cases was seen(p -0.013). Amongst other factors affecting OAS were CD4 counts (p -0.0001), site of disease(p -0.006)), HAART therapy (0.0001) and type of chemotherapy. Conclusion: Gray zones exists in ARL and there is tendency to overcall PL and the gray zone entities need to be weeded out for better patient management.",

Besides, 1p36, bcl-2, bcl-6, IgH gene rearrangement by FISH analysis was performed. Results: Stathmin 1 expression was detected in 88,9 % of cases. There was a positive correlation between the histologic grade and Stathmin 1 positivity (p = 0.001, Chi-Square test). All BCL2-cases (n = 13) were positive for Stathmin 1 whereas, 8/9 of CD10-cases were positively stained. FISH analyses are pending. Conclusion: We showed that Stathmin 1 was helpful in detecting BCL2and CD10-follicular lymphomas, and it could be a novel diagnostic marker for those problematic cases. Objective: The aim of the study is to determine the incidence& prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutations and protein expression in myeloid stem cell diseases with concurrent bone marrow fibrosis. Method: The bone marrow aspirations&biopsies of 84 adult patients diagnosed as MDS-F, MDS/MPN-F and PMF-SF at Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Pathology Department between the years 2008-2013 were included in the study. Patients were evaluated according to clinicomorphological parameters& ASXL1 mutations/protein expression and their prognostic value were investigated. Results: Immunohistochemistry(IHC) was found to be concordant with s e q u e n c i n g i n t e r m s o f d e t e c t i n g n o n s e n s e m u t a t i o n s (100%sensitivity&specifity). ASXL1 mutations/protein expression shorten the OS and were significantly associated with male gender, anemia, high blast count, dysplasia in \u22652 lineages, increase in stromal plasma cells and leukemic transformation, but not correlated with fibrosis. This is the first study investigating the associations between ASXL1 mutations/ protein expression and morphological parameters and comparing the ASXL1 mutational status and protein expression. Two nonsense, 5 missense unannotated mutations and 2 novel genetic alterations on 3'UTR have been discovered. Conclusion: The algorithm to be chosen to detect the ASXL1 mutational status could be screening the protein expression by IHC and if score 2/3 staining is observed, molecular method could be performed to define the specific mutation. Objective: Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma type 1 (EATL) is a leading cause of mortality in adult-onset coeliac disease. While miRNA expression has been investigated in other T-cell lymphomas, the objective of this pilot study is to elucidate the miRNA signature of EATL. Method: A search of the laboratory information system of two universityaffiliated hospitals was carried out to identify cases of EATL over a 14-year period (2000-2014) . Available histological and molecular features were reviewed by two histopathologists. An extensive meta-analysis of miRNA associated with T-cell lymphoma and T-cell function was carried out and a shortlist of 95 miRNAs was created. RNAwas extracted and quantified from 20 paraffin-embedded samples (10 EATL and 10 controls, comprising 5 samples of small bowel without enteropathy and 5 samples with coeliac disease), and assays were run, using customised TLDA cards. Statistically significant miRs were identified, using a t-test on R bio conductor software. Results: Findings included identifying an increase in the expression of vertebrate-specific miRNAs, miR-196a and miR196b. An eight-fold increase in the expression of miR-127, known to be associated with the regulation of genes involved in apoptosis, was identified. An eight-fold reduction in the expression of miR-141 was identified. Conclusion: This pilot study has identified candidate miRNAs potentially involved in the pathogenesis of EATL.",

Method: At our institution 12 pts were treated with alloHSCT for MF between 2012 and 2015, in 7 cases BM trephines at diagnosis and at follow-up (days +40 \u00b1 10 and +100 \u00b1 10) were available. These pts were aged 36-57 years. 5 pts had primary MF, 1 -post-PV MF, 1 -post-ET MF. 3/6 were JAK-2+, 1/2 were CALR+. 6 pts are alive in remission at the present time with median follow-up 13 months, one patient died from graft failure and infectious complications. Bone marrow samples were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, decalcified in EDTA and processed routinely. H&E, Giemsa and Gomori stains were done. Results: At diagnosis all pts showed features of corresponding myeloproliferative neoplasm with severe MF, consistent with grade 2-3 according to European consensus approach. At day +40 MF was reduced by 1 grade, and at day +100 5 of 7 pts showed MF grade 0-1 with restoration of normal BM architecture. Conclusion: AlloHSCT is an effective treatment modality for myelofibrosis. By day +100 we observed restoration of normal BM architecture with MF0-1 in 5 of 7 pts included in the study. Objective: Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a tumour mass consisting of myeloid blasts presenting at an anatomical site other than the bone marrow (BM). It can be seen de novo or in association with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasias (MPN), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) . The aim of this study was to evaluate the presenting features, morphological and immunohistochemical features of MS cases diagnosed in our institution, in view of the literature. Method: We searched the medical records of our institution for the patients diagnosed as MS between 1999 and 2015. Fourty cases were found and reevaluated. Results: Median age was 37.9 years (range: 5 months-84 years); 26 were male, 14 were female. The most commonly involved sites were the lymph nodes, soft tissue, bone, and skin. Immunohistochemically, CD68-KP1 was the most commonly expressed marker (31/34; 91 %), followed by CD33 (7/9; 77.7 %), MPO (25/36; 69.4 %) , CD117 (18/28; 64 %), lysozyme (18/ 29; 62 %), CD68-PGM1 (2/4, 50 %), and CD34 (12/33; 36.3 %). BM examination revealed AML in 13 cases (only five cases manifested with preceding or coincidental AML); MPN or MDS in 11 cases, and none were found in 9 cases. Four cases showed central nervous system involvement in cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases manifested in multiple sites. Conclusion: MS is a rare extra-medullary tumour mass composed of immature myeloid cells. It may present with variable morphological and phenotypic features in addition to pathological diagnostic challenges. Extensive immunohistochemical panel may be necessary for accurate differential diagnosis which is critical for appropriate therapy. Objective: To determine the accuracy of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) complemented by flow cytometry (FC) for the diagnosis of lymphoid lesions. Method: Consecutive 252 FNACs of lymphoid lesions studied with complementary FC, over a period of 10 years, were retrieved from our files and correlated with histology and/or clinical follow-up if available. FC was performed with the following antibodies in a panel: CD45, CD19, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5, CD10, CD23, FMC-7, Kappa and Lambda chains. Results: 198/252 (78, 6 %) FNACs were diagnosed as reactive, 32/252 (12,7 %) as aberrant phenotypic trait (suspicious), 20/252 (7,9 %) as malignant and 2/252 (0,8 %) as inconclusive. The results of histological examination were available in 18/20 malignant lesions, in 23/32 suspicious cases, in the 2 inconclusive cases and in 28/198 reactive cases. 16/ 18 (88,9 %) malignant lesions, the 2 (100 %) inconclusive cases and 10/ 23 (43,5 %) suspicious cases were diagnosed as malignant. In 23/28 (82,1 %) reactive cytological cases, a benign process was diagnosed by histology. Correlation with histology showed a sensitivity of 86 % and a specificity of 90 %. Conclusion: FC is an important additional tool in the cytological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders, being the combined approach a useful technique for distinguishing reactive lymphoid proliferations from malignant lymphomas.",

The CS assay uses anti-EpCAM ferrofluid magnetic particles to capture and anti-CK8/18/19 to visualize CTCs. This approach entails potentially false negatives given the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in some CTCs. The absence of cytopathological criteria on isolated cells does not assert their tumour nature. We evaluated the CS specificity in patients with non-neoplastic lung disease. Method: The CS analysis was performed in 37 patients before surgery for non-tumoural thoracic pathology: infectious diseases [tuberculosis (n = 6); actinomycosis (n = 1), aspergillosis (n = 2), abscess (n = 3); bronchopneumonia (n = 2)], inflammatory and degenerative diseases (n = 15); and various other thoracic nontumoural diseases (n = 8). Results: 5/36 (14 %) patients had at least 2 epithelial cells detected by the CS method. One patient had prior history cancer but progression was not observed. No patient developed cancer pathology after 6 years of clinical follow-up. Conclusion: CS technique can detect non-tumoural epithelial cells and gives false positive results of CTCs. \"CTCs\" terminology may seem overused when reporting results. The lack of precise cytomorphological criteria with the CS method is a strong limit to this technology.",

Method: An integrated analysis of copy-number aberrations and gene expression profiles in 105 lung adenocarcinomas was used to uncover genes associated with coordinated gene expression profiles. Gene expression levels were validated by qPCR. Gene products were localized by Immunolabeling in tumour tissues. Results: Sphingosine-kinase 1 (SphK1) was overexpressed in cases with gains of 17q compared to cases with diploid 17q (p < 0.05). SphK1 overexpression correlated with a signature that overlapped with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) hallmark signature (q value 1 E-67, GSEA, Broad Institute). Genes in the SphK1-associated signature included EMT inducers (SNAI1, SNAI2 and TWIST1), many collagens and fibroblast activation genes (FAP, POSTN). Using monoclonal antibodies that reacted specifically with SphK1 or SNAI2-the EMT inducer that most strongly correlated with SPHK1 expression -, we could localize the proteins to tumour cells. These results were confirmed by showing the localization of SphK1 or SNAI2 to cells overexpressing TP53. Conclusion: Deregulated SphK1 in tumour cells was associated with 17q gains and an EMT signature in lung adenocarcinomas. This suggests that overexpression of SphK1 in tumour cells can contribute to an EMT in lung cancers. Objective: Expression of PD-L1 in tumour and immune-cells has demonstrated predictive value to atezolizumab treatment in NSCLC patients1, and emerged as a promising biomarker for the selection of patients to cancer immunotherapies. Given the difficulty in obtaining tissue for biomarker assessment in NSCLC, we investigated the utility of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) as a non-invasive method to evaluate PD-L1 status in advanced NSCLC patients. Method: CTCs were enriched from peripheral blood samples from 80 NSCLC patients (ISET platform, Rarecells) . PD-L1 expression in CTCs and matched-tumour-tissue was evaluated by IHC (SP142, Ventana), and quantified in tumour and white blood cells. Results: CTCs ranged from 2 to 268 CTCs/4 ml, with median 65 CTCs/4 ml. 6 patients (7.5 %) showed \u22651 PDL-1 positive CTC, and 16 patients (20 %) showed >1 % PDL-1 positive tumour cells in tissue with 93 % concordance between tissue and CTCs. 46 patients (58 %) showed >1 % PDL-1 positive immune infiltrates in tissue, and 39 patients (49 %) showed >1 % PDL-1 positive in circulating WBC, with 80 % concordance between blood and tissue. Conclusion: PD-L1 status in CTCs and WBCs correlated well with PD-L1 status in tissue, revealing the potential of CTCs as a non-invasive realtime biopsy to evaluate PDL-1 expression in NSCLC. Objective: \u0394Np63/p40-positive resected SCC of the lung (n = 101) were analyzed for FGFR1 gene amplification and driver-mutations in FGFR2/ 3 genes to investigate their prognostic value. Method: FISH-analysis was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues. For the detection of K660N/K660E (FGFR2) and R248C/ S249C (FGFR3) mutations, tumour DNA was sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Results: Twenty-two of 101 (22 %) samples were amplification positive based on a FGFR1/CEN8 ratio 2.0 or higher. In advanced stages (III-IV), patients carrying the amplification showed significantly longer overall survival (p = 0,006). Among women, amplification was significantly associated with longer overall survival (p = 0,023). The FGFR1 gene amplification status was associated with younger patient age (65 versus 69 years, p = 0,046); there was no association with gender, tumour stage, histologic subtype, tumour grade or \u0394Np63/p40-immunoreactivity. In one out of 101 cases (1 %) the S249C mutation was identified, there was no indication that it influences overall survival; the K600N, K660E or R248C mutations were not identified. Conclusion: In SCC of the lung, FGFR1 gene amplification is a frequent genetic alteration whereas K660N/K660E (FGFR2) and R249C/S249C (FGFR3) are rare events. In SCC of the lung, FGFR1 gene amplification appears not to be a negative but rather a favorable prognostic factor for women and particularly for patients with advanced tumours.",

Lee * Mayo Clinic, Dept. of Pathology, Jacksonville, USA Objective: To correlate radiologic and pathologic findings in patients who received lung allografts for a clinical diagnosis of end-stage sarcoidosis. Method: From 2001 to 2016, 20 patients (4 % of our total) were transplanted for presumed end-stage pulmonary sarcoidosis. Pretransplant high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images of the chest were reviewed by a thoracic radiologist. The explants were reviewed for the type of fibrosis and the presence of granulomas. Results: The HRCT opinions were as follows: likely sarcoidosis, likely usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and other. The \"likely sarcoidosis\" HRCT category (15 cases) histologically corresponded to sarcoid type fibrosis with granulomas in 11 cases and without granulomas in 4 cases. The \"likely UIP\" HRCT category (4 cases) histologically corresponded to UIP pattern in 3 cases and sarcoid type fibrosis with granulomas in 1 case. Multidisciplinary discussion concerning these latter cases resulted in a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in 3 cases and sarcoidosis in 1 case, respectively. Finally, \"other\" HRCT findings (1 case) represented sarcoidosis-related pulmonary veno-occlusive disease histologically. Conclusion: (1) End-stage sarcoidosis may lack granulomas. (2) Patients presumed to have end-stage sarcoidosis may show UIP pattern. This may be due to the development of IPF in a patient with a clinical history of sarcoidosis. Objective: To study morphological features of pulmonary embolism. Method: Autopsy examination. Results: 2926 autopsies served as the material for the analysis (1568 men-48.1 %, 1358 women-51.9 %), which were obtained from postmortem studies in Moscow and Ryazan. Among the sources of all thromboembolic complications by frequency of occurrence in the first place are the veins (venous sinuses) of crus and thigh (femoral popliteal-iliac-segment) (50.1 % of both men and women), in the second-the right heart cavity (18.7 %). Other separate systems of vena cava inferior (pelvic, hemorrhoidal, hepatic veins and vena cava inferior itself) were the source of thrombosis in 9.8 %.",

Acquired factors predisposing to thrombosis are many conditions that can be grouped by the pathogenetic principle: activation of coagulation factors and fibrinolysis violation; pathology of platelets; deceleration and/or blood flow disturbance; changes in blood rheology; damage to the endothelium and vascular wall; drug therapy. For example, thrombin increases the expression of cell adhesion molecules. Also, we can indicate that the thromboembolic process is associated with the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as P-selectin, ICAM-1 (CD54) and VCAM-1 (CD106). Conclusion: At this level of study leading factor in this pathology is mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary arterial system. Pathologic picture of death by pulmonary embolism is made by complex of pathological changes. The main of them is the presence of thromboembolism in the gaps of pulmonary trunk system, the second-the source of thromboembolism, the third-the macro and / or microscopic reactive changes.",

This study aimed to analyze morphological and molecular features of \u03b11(V) and \u03b12(V) chains and the role of COL5A1, COL5A2 gene expression in fibrillogenesis in a cohort of patients with early SSc-related pulmonary fibrosis. Method: Pulmonary biopsies were obtained from 7 patients with SScrelated fibrosis and 7 healthy controls. Morphometry, immunofluorescence and qPCR were performed to characterize microscopic changes of \u03b11(V) and \u03b12(V) protein and levels of RNA COL5A1, COL5A2. Results: Lung immunofluorescence and qPCR data distinguished patients with SSc-related pulmonary fibrosis from healthy controls. In lungs of patients with SSc-related fibrosis who had abnormal histoarchitecture, immunofluorescence confirmed increased markers of \u03b11(V) protein around the alveolar septa and capillaries resulting in a fine net pattern on collapsed areas and overexpression of \u03b12(V) in capillaries and vessels. qPCR revealed increased COL5A1 and COL5A2. Conclusion: These results highlight major pathogenic pathways relevant to lung in SSc-related fibrosis suggesting that a post-translational modification of \u03b11(V) chain and up-regulated expression of COL5A1regulated gene can interfering with the normal extracellular matrix lung parenchyma. Further studies on the inhibition of \u03b11(V) chain are necessary to test if gene therapy can attenuate effects of this disease.",

Furak Objective: In view of the new WHO classification of lung neoplasms, we analyzed the survival of resected stage Ia adenocarcinomas according to their histological type. Method: Between 2004 and 2013, 183 stage Ia adenocarcinomas were resected from 72 men and 111 women (mean age: 62.3 years). The subtypes of the adenocarcinomas were as follows: in situ adenocarcinoma 11 (6 %), minimally invasive 9 (5 %), lepidic 31 (17 %), acinar 45 (24 %), papillary 29 (16 %) , solid 47 (26 %) and micropapillary carcinoma 11 (6 %). The subtypes of adenocarcinomas and the overal survival were compared between the low grade (in situ, minimally invasive, lepidic), intermediate grade (acinar, papillary) and the high grade (solid and micropapillary) adenocarcinoma groups. Results: The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival were as follows: in situ (100 %), minimally invasive (88.9 %), lepidic (87.7 %), acinar (89.6 %), papillary (85.8 %), solid (65.5 %) and micropapillary (27.3 %) with a significant difference between the low+intermediate and high grade (55.6 %) groups (p = 0.001), and inside the high grade group between solid and micropapillary carcinomas (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Micropapillary adenocarcinoma had the worst survival among the different subtypes of stage Ia adenocarcinomas, therefore adjuvant treatment should be considered even in stage Ia. Objective: To evaluate similarities and differences between diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia syndrome (DIPNECH) and carcinoid tumours with/without NECH. Method: Clinical and imaging data (gender, age, symptoms, respiratory function, smoking habit, computed-tomography/CT pattern), pathologic features (histotype, tumour size, and stage, mitotic rate, necrosis, central/ peripheral site), immunohistochemical findings (TTF-1, hormonal receptors, CD10, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, p40, napsin, GRP/ bombesin, ACTH, p70S6K, mTOR, SSTR2, Rb, ALK) and molecular gene mutations (EGFR, KRAS, c-KIT, PDGFRs) were collected from 19 DIPNECH and 132 pulmonary carcinoids. Results: Overall, there were 77 females and 74 males with a median age of 57 years. Fifty-eight percent were non-smokers, 49 % were symptomatic. One-hundred forty-one were typical carcinoids (93.4 %), 110 in stage IA and 82 showed a central/peri-hilar location. Neither molecular alterations nor ALK expression were detected. Patients with DIPNECH significantly differed in terms of gender (all females, p < 0.0001), smoke (non-smokers, p = 0.021), presence of symptoms, obstructive/mixed respiratory function, peripheral location and air-trapping with histologyconfirmed constrictive bronchiolitis (p < 0.0001). Among immunohistochemical markers, DIPNECH was statistically correlated with higher expression of TTF-1, CD10 and GRP/bombesin-like peptide (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: No single biomarker may distinguish DIPNECH from carcinoids with/without NECH, but patients with DIPNECH syndrome are significantly associated with symptomatic small airway alterations.",

Gencturk * Ankara University, Pathology, Turkey Objective: To investigate the incidence of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations in Turkish non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients and to evaluate the associated pathological and immunohistochemical features. Method: 600 primary and metastatic therapy-naive NSCLC cases (biopsy, cytology, resection specimens) were evaluated for EGFR mutation by Sanger sequencing. H&E and immunohistochemical sections were examined; available cases were stained for TTF-1 and NapsinA by forming a tissue array. Results: Sequencing was successful in 532 (88.6 %) cases. A total of 74 mutations were detected in 70 patients (13.1 %) (61.4 % woman, 38.6 % man). The distribution of mutations was 6.8, 51.3, 8.2 and 33.7 %; in exons 18, 19 , 20 and 21 respectively. All EGFR mutant cases, except for one case was positive for TTF-1. All mutant cases were also positive for Napsin A, except for two cases. Conclusion: EGFR mutation rate is lower than that of Asia Pacific in Turkish NSCLC cases. Mutation rate and distribution are similar to other European countries. TTF-1 negativity is a good predictor of a wild type EGFR. We think that, TTF-1 status could be incorporated in molecular algorithm of NSCLC cases in resource poor countries.",

Method: All 1039 patients with a mediastinal pathology exam at H\u00f4tel-Dieu de France University Hospital from January 1991 to December 2015 were included. Results: 628 (60.4 %) had a mediastinal neoplasm. Most cases were lymphomas (33.3 %) with a mean age of 34.0 years, or metastases (32.3 %) with a mean age of 59.8 years. Those were followed by thymic neoplasms (17.5 %), ectopic tumours (8.0 %), mesenchymal tumours (5.9 %), germ cell tumours (1.6 % with a mean age of 29.6 years), and other rare tumours (1.4 %) . A striking male predominance was found for metastases and mesenchymal tumours (Male/Female sex ratios of 1.9 and 2.1 respectively). Within thymic neoplasms, thymomas represented 71.8 %. Of the 411 non-tumoural patients (39.6 %), 42.1 % had a granulomatous reaction, 9.0 % a thymic hyperplasia or cyst, and 4.4 % a cyst (bronchogenic/pericardic/enteric). The remaining 44.5 % cases had no specific diagnosis (mostly lymph nodes and thymectomies). The mean age of patients with a granulomatous reaction was 46.4 years, compared to 31.1 years for the cysts. Conclusion: Reporting the descriptive epidemiology of mediastinal pathologies establishes the basis for further investigations. The adopted diagnostic procedures efficacy can now be evaluated. Objective: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterized by thrombus organization, pulmonary remodeling and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Our aims was to determinate a plasma circulating microRNA profile as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of CTEPH. Method: 12 CTEPH patients, 10 patients with pulmonary hypertension of other causes and 10 healthy volunteers were sequentially studied in 2016. All relevant clinical data from medical records, the V/Qscan and/or angiotomography, and right heart catheterization results were analyzed. An optimized protocol for RNA extraction from plasma samples by Qiagen mirneasy serum/plasma kit in combination with the Vac-Man\u00ae Vacuum Manifold were used. The Illumina TruSeq Small RNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit was used to generate small RNA library directly from total RNA. Clustering and sequencing was accomplished using the Illumina NextSeq500. Further databases and software used for analysis were the Diana software. Results: The New York Heart Association Functional Classification and the levels of N-terminal-pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide did not differ between pulmonary hypertension groups. High-quality RNA were extracted. Circulating microRNAs were differentially expressed and associated with prognostic outcome (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The MicroRNA profile might reflect pathogenesis of CTEPH, providing some clue for biomarker screening, however it still needed to be validated to clinical practice. Objective: Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a pleural tumour associated with asbestos exposure and subsequent chronic inflammation. Epithelioid mesothelioma is associated with a better patient prognosis compared with sarcomatoid/biphasic subtypes. The aim of this study was to characterize inflammatory cell infiltrates in mesothelioma samples and to correlate morphological features with clinical data. Method: Peritumoural and intratumoural inflammatory cells were characterized by Immunohistochemistry and quantified in 34 mesotheliomas (17 epthelioid and 17 sarcomatoid/biphasic) and expressed as percentage of neoplastic area. Overall (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) after standard first-line platinum/pemetrexed were also evaluated. Results: Higher inflammation percentages were seen in epithelioid mesotheliomas both in intra and peritumoural areas (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05). B lymphocytes were mainly detected in peritumoural area, while T lymphocytes and macrophages were present both at the intra and peritumoural level. Epithelioid mesotheliomas seem to be characterized by higher values of peritumoural B lymphocytes, while sarcomatoid/ bipahasic samples showed higher percentages of intratumoural T lymphocytes and macrophages. A significant correlation was found between total inflammation and PFS (p = 0.03) and between intratumoural macrophage infiltration and OS (p = 0.05). Conclusion: Epithelioid and sarcomatoid/biphasic mesotheliomas are characterized by different inflammation patterns that might impact survival. A confirmatory study on a larger sample size and correlation with asbestos exposure is currently ongoing. Objective: Few recent works report some different morphological features of lung cancer in smokers with and without COPD. To date it is unknown if COPD-associated lung cancer has a different molecular profile. We aimed to analyze gene mutations in adenocarcinoma samples from smokers with COPD versus smokers without COPD by using next generation sequencing (NGS).",

Results: COPD and non-COPD smokers showed a median value of 1.5 and 2 mutations for each patient. When considering only mutations with well known pathogenetic role, at least one gene was altered in 75 % of COPD, 79 % of non-COPD smokers, and the most affected genes were KRAS (48 %), PTEN (19 %), P53 (19 %), EGFR (11 %) with no significant differences among the groups. Sporadic mutations in MET, STK11 and PIK3CA were detected only in non-COPD smokers. Adenocarcinoma of non-COPD smokers showed a higher prevalence of solid/papillary pattern and proliferation index. Conclusion: NGS analysis revealed a partially different molecular profile in lung adenocarcinoma of smokers with and without COPD. The significance of sporadic mutations detected in non COPD smokers and their influence on the different histological pattern of adenocarcinoma should be confirmed by larger scale studies. Objective: Most non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are diagnosed from small specimens, and classification using standard pathology methods can be difficult. This is important as many therapies and clinical trials are histology-dependent. Our objective was to develop an RNA signature as an adjunct test for histo-pathological classification of NSCLCs. Method: A microarray dataset of resected adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) was used to develop an ADC-SCC classifier. Another dataset of ADCs and non-malignant lung was used for a Tumour vs Nonmalignant classifier. Sample classification was determined by a nearest distance approach. Results: We developed a 62-gene expression signature that contains many genes used in immunostains for NSCLC typing. It includes 42 genes that distinguish ADC from SCC and 20 genes differentiating non-malignant lung from lung cancer. Testing of the TCGA and other public datasets resulted in high prediction accuracies (93-95 %). A prediction score was derived that correlates both with histologic grading and prognosis. Using the HTG EdgeSeq technology (HTG Molecular Diagnostics, Inc. (HTG)) the classifier can be applied to FFPE specimens and core-needle biopsies, demonstrating the potential for deployment in standard clinical practice. Conclusion: Our classifier provides an objective, quantitative method for the pathological classification of NSCLC.",

Objective: Clinical responses to immunotherapy by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in NSCLC may be associated with PD-L1 expression. We investigated the activation of Kras-mutant subtypes as a mechanism of PD-L1 regulation in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Method: PD-L1 expression was evaluated by IHC (SP142 clone, Ventana) on 117 LUAD (KrasWT, n = 51; Krasmut, n = 66). Stable cell lines were generated by transfection of Kras-G12D, G12V, G12C and WT plasmids into Beas2B bronchial cells.",

Kras-mutant PD-L1+ tumours had increased CD66b+neutrophil infiltrates and lower CD8+ T-cell content than PD-L1 \u2212 tumours. In vitro, mutant Kras led to significantly higher cell-surface PD-L1 expression and PD-L1 transcripts, notably in KrasG12C and KrasG12V cells, suggesting PD-L1 transcriptional regulation. There was differential activation of NF-kB, ERK and Pi3k/Akt pathways between Kras-mutant subtypes. PD-L1 was upregulated 3-fold by stimulation with IFN\u03b3, independently of the Kras codon subtypes. Instead, hypoxia significantly increased PD-L1 expression in KrasG12C and KrasG12D cells only.",

Results: The analytic validation demonstrated 70 % sensitivity and 98 % specificity for the ctDNA assays (limit-of-detection <5 %). ctDNA yield was not affected by storage in BCT tubes for up to 3 days. Real-time longitudinal ctDNA analysis showed that among 18 % of initially EGFR mutated patients, 33 % acquire T790M resistance mutation during treatment. 74 % of patients had at least one somatic alteration detected by NGS assay, with druggable alterations in various genes (e.g. MET, FGFR3). Mean turnaround time was 13 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] days for tumour tissue and 6 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] days for ctDNA analyses. Conclusion: Rigorously validated ctDNA assays is an alternative approach for tumour tissue molecular analysis and may enable longitudinal examination of molecular profiling in NSCLC patients.

The models were refined for the structural parameters and thermodynamic parameters. Subsequently, cavity analysis and molecular docking was conducted between GTP/GDP and RAS proteins.",

Prabhash, R. Kumar Objective: The aim of this study was to establish a comprehensive strategy for the detection of clinically relevant somatic mutations in plasma of lung cancer patients both at diagnosis and during disease follow-up. Method: Plasma samples from controls were used to optimize the experimental approach. To evaluate our strategy, plasma samples obtained at different stages of disease were collected from 100 lung cancer patients. Different enrichment strategies where tested. All amplified products were used to prepare libraries and sequenced using Ion Torrent systems. Digital PCR was used to confirm results. Results: In plasma isolated from lung cancer patients, tumour derived genetic mutations could be identified in as little as 10 ng of cfDNA. Mutations identified in cfDNA mirrored mutations identified in tumour biopsies. Mutations with VAF <0.1 % could be detected in cfDNA and confirmed using Digital PCR. Response to therapy could be observed by tracking specific mutations in cfDNA and detection of tumour relapse could be anticipated up to 2 months when compared to standard methodologies. Conclusion: In conclusion, the comprehensiveness and speed of the NGS methodology, combined with the high sensitivity of detection, delivered a protocol for detection of somatic mutations in cfDNA for non-invasive real time therapy response monitoring of cancer patients. Objective: Tumours release mutated DNA into the blood, which can be analyzed by sensitive molecular methods. This \"liquid biopsies\" are interesting in lung cancer pathology, for follow-up and monitoring of patients under TKI. There is not yet a gold standard for mutation testing of liquid biopsies. We have compared the Biorad QX200 droplet digital PCR and the Ion Torrent Semiconductor sequencing for analyzing mutations in liquid biopsies of lung and skin cancer patients. Method: DNA was extracted from blood samples of patients suffering from lung or skin cancer using the Qiagen QIAamp circulating nucleic acid extraction kit. Mutation analysis was performed with the Biorad QX200 and the Ion Torrent Proton sequencer (Ion Ampliseq Colon/ Lung; Cancer-Hotspot panel).",

It was able to determine the reliability of the measurement in each analysis by counting molecules. However, only single mutations can be detected per PCR reaction. Conclusion: Both approaches are valid methods to detect mutations in circulating tumour DNA. The additional sensitivity of digital PCR comes at the cost of using nearly all available DNA for a single hotspot analysis. NGS is sensitive enough to detect biologically relevant levels of mutated DNA offering the advantage of analyzing a range of mutations in parallel.

Analysis enables sensitive and specific detection of somatic mutations to 0.1 % allele ratio. We demonstrated the analysis in control and archived cfDNA research samples where 157 biomarkers relevant to non-small cell lung cancer were interrogated simultaneously.

We found predominantly granulomatous phlebitis (35 %), predominantly lymphocytic phlebitis (32.5 %), predominantly neutrophilic phlebitis (26.5 %) and mixture of neutrophil and granulomatous phlebitis (6 %). Small-vesseled vasculitis was found (11.7 %). One showed aneurysmal change. Immunofluorescence demonstrates superficial vessel wall deposition of IgM and /or complement (53 %). Conclusion: Cutaneous manifestations and inflammatory response of nodular ST were similar to cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (c-PAN). Although, vasculitis was present, this was not indicated of c-PAN. Objective: Our goal was to analyze morphological, ultrastructural and molecular features of \u03b11(V) and \u03b12(V) chains and COL5A1, COL5A2 gene expression in fibrillogenesis from patients with early systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related cutaneous fibrosis in order to understand the protein and molecular pathways implicated in cutaneous disease. Method: Skin biopsies were obtained from 5 consecutive patients with SSc-related fibrosis and treatment-na\u00efve, and 5 healthy controls. Immunofluorescence and immune electron microscopy were performed to characterize microscopic and submicroscopic changes of \u03b11(V) and \u03b12(V) chains. COL5A1 and COL5A2 mRNA was evaluated by qPCR. Results: In skin of patients immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed increased markers of \u03b11(V) and \u03b12(V) chains in reticular dermis, in addition to marked loss of \u03b11(V) in the papillary dermis and overexpression of \u03b12(V) in capillaries and vessels. COL5A1 and COL5A2 mRNA expression was increased, nevertheless relative level of \u03b11(V) expression was significantly reduced in cutaneous fibroblasts. Interestingly, inhibition of COL5A2 gene was associated with increased expression of COL5A1 gene. Conclusion: These results highlight major pathogenic pathways relevant to skin in SSc-related fibrosis: a post-translational modification of \u03b11(V) chain, thus interfering with the normal extracellular matrix formation in papillary dermis. Further studies on the inhibition of \u03b11(V) chain are necessary to test if gene therapy can attenuate effects of this disease.",

All of the found nevus remnants (n = 9) had a positive BRAF V600E expression and so had their corresponding primary melanoma. In one case we incidentally found a BRAF V600E positive nevus in close relation to a wild type primary melanoma. Conclusion: Primary tumour tissue can be used just as safely as metastatic tissue for BRAF V600E mutation analysis since inter-tumoural heterogeneity does not exist.

Conclusion: In conclusion, T cell infiltration into primary melanoma is a strong predictor of survival after DC vaccination in metastatic melanoma patients. The infiltration remains predictive even after adjustment for latestage prognostic markers. Our findings suggest that the I/P ratio is a potential predictive biomarker for treatment selection. Objective: In non melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), as in several tumours, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been established as an important therapeutic target.

Method: Twenty-five cases of cPAN were retrospectively reviewed of clinical presentation and treatment outcome. Histopathologic finding were evaluated by consensus of two dermatopathologists. Results: Seven men and 18 women were included with the average age of 34 years (14-52 years) . Majority of cases presented with multiple nodules on both legs (92 %). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was detected in 4 cases (4 %) and none of the cases showed systemic autoimmune/connective diseases. Histopathologically, detection of internal elastic lamina using Verhoeff-Van Gieson (VVG) elastic stain was the most common key features found in our study (68 %) followed by fibrinoid necrosis of muscular walls (56 %) and small-vessel vasculitis (32 %). Concentric continuous smooth muscle pattern was the supportive feature for diagnosis of arterial involvement in cPAN, however; we found one case of discontinuous wreath pattern of muscular wall despite the present of internal elastic lamina. Most cases were treated with oral anti-inflammatory agent as colchicine (81 % Objective: Breast carcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm and the second cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Galectin-3 is a member of the beta-galactoside-binding family that plays a role in cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. A prospective study was done to determine the role of galectin-3 in breast cancer chemoresistance with the aim of establishing galectin-3 expression as a biomarker for drug resistance. Method: In total, 75 cases of breast carcinoma treated with neo-adjuvant therapy were collected and tissue samples from pre-neo-adjuvant therapy as well as tissues from post-neo-adjuvant therapy of those cases were collected and stained with immunohistochemistry. Results: Almost one quarter of the cases show complete pathological response with complete disappearance of the tumour following neoadjuvant therapy, while three quarters of the cases show incomplete pathological response. Approximately, 70 % of cases with complete response show no expression of galectin -3 in breast cancer cells in pre-neo-adjuvant biopsies and 61 % of residual cancer cells show high expression of galectin-3. Conclusion: There is a significant correlation between the expression of Galectin-3 by breast carcinoma cells and resistance to chemotherapy.",

Results: After the IHC testing complete consensus among the four institutions was achieved for 7 (43.8 %) of the 16 specimens. Retesting by ISH of the 8 specimens scored as equivocal by at least one laboratory, increased the concordance rate to 68.8 % (11/16), while a diagnostic discordance was found in two cases. A complete concordance between testing centers for ISH was found for 9 (56.3 %) of the 16 specimens. The group of discordant findings consisted of 4 cases having borderline HER2-positivity determined by at least one center, and one case with diagnostic discordance. Conclusion: The current regional ring study in which the level of consensus among the testing centers for HER2 testing by both IHC and ISH was similar to already reported in previous studies, in spite of the unstandardized conditions, highlights the usefulness of implementing such slide-exchange programs as an additional instrument for external quality control.

Co-expression of AR and GATA3 is a specific feature of molecular apocrine type TNBC, which may serve as a diagnostic aid for cancer of unknown primary. Results: Core needle biopsy showed tubular glands lined by single layer of cells, lacking a myoepithelial cell layer, embedded in sclerotic stroma. ER and PR were negative. S100 was positive. The differential diagnosis included tubular carcinoma and MGA and on the basis of absent hormone receptor expression and S100 positivity, the latter was favoured. Subsequent wide local excision showed a 4 cm mass, demonstrating a spectrum of MGA and atypical MGA, merging with invasive carcinoma. Centrally, a 2 cm area showed unequivocal features of invasive ductal carcinoma grade 2, negative for ER, PR, Her2, CK5/6 and CK14 while positive for S100, Actin, AE1/3 and p53(weak). The sentinel node was negative for metastasis. Margins were extensively involved, necessitating subsequent mastectomy. The patient underwent systemic chemotherapy and remains well 3 years later. Objective: p63 is used as an immunohistochemical marker of squamous, myoepithelial, prostate basal and urothelial cells in histopathology practice. p40 is reported to be superior to p63 as a squamous carcinoma marker in the differential diagnosis of lung cancer, and equal to p63 as a myoepithelial marker in breast lesions. We investigated the p40 expression of breast cancer tumour cells in molecular subtypes, and in metaplastic breast cancer subtypes reported to express p63 frequently. Method: Breast carcinomas of each surrogate immunohistochemistry classified molecular subtypes and 20 metaplastic breast carcinomas were retrospectively evaluated for p40 expression by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody. Results: p40 expression was detected in 5/37 ( Results: The number of involved lymph nodes ranged from 1 to 14 (mean 3.77 \u00b1 3.14).

Conclusion: Microvascular proliferation is a novel marker of active angiogenesis and is highly associated with aggressive features in breast cancer. Objective: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are a heterogeneous set of tumours characterized by absence of actionable therapeutic targets. Increased aggressiveness of TNBC, as well as a resistance to standard therapies, may be associated with the presence of cancer stem cell (CSC) populations within the tumour, the role of which and a prognostic value in TNBC is still debatable. Method: We analised the relationships between CD44/CD24 CSC cell phenotype, expression of tenascin-C, described as an extracellular marker for CSC niche, parameters of tumour progression and a pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We evaluated TNBC specimens of 30 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with platinum agents. The protein expression of CD44, CD24 and tenascin-C was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Our results didn't reveal any correlation between CSC markers and tumour characteristics, such as Ki-67, nodal status and distant metastasis. Tenascin-C was found to be highly associated with the CD44+/ CD24-/low phenotype and a chemotherapy sensitivity. All tumour cases where CD44+/CD24-/low phenotype combined with a prominent tenascin-C expression had a poor pathologic response and exhibited the chemotherapy resistence. All other pattern combinations of CSCs markers didn't relate to negative response to chemotherapy. Conclusion: Our results highlighted a potential prognostic role for CD44+/CD24-/low/ tenascin-C+ tumour phenotype in TNBC resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with platinum agents.

The evidence search identified 119 references; 8 contained extractable numeric information at evidence level 3 (Oxford system). We calculated relative risk of post-radiation breast angiosarcoma of 3 to 6 and number needed to harm of 1500 to 3000, after a median latency of 7 years. The prevalence of radiation-induced breast angiosarcoma is 36/1000, compared to 6/1000 for primary breast angiosarcoma. Objective: We evaluated immunohistochemical expression of EMT and CSC markers in PTs in relation to their expression to various clinicopathological parameters and survival outcomes. Method: Immunohistochemistry was performed on 360 PTs using tissue microarray sections. The expression of molecules related to EMT (S100A4) and CSCs (ALDH1) was assessed in stromal cells of tumours. Biomarker expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters and disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) calculated. Results: 360 tumours were assessed. Of these 241 (67 %) tumours were benign, 87 (24.2 %) borderline and 32 (8.9 %) malignant. Stromal expression of ALDH1 and S100A4 was observed in 52.5 and 22.5 % of cases. Combined expression of both markers was seen in 13.3 % of tumours. Tumour grade, stromal cell atypia and increased stromal mitoses were associated with increased expression of ALDH1 and S100A4 (p < 0.001). Patients whose tumours expressed ALDH1disclosed a trend of poorer OS but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.160) whereas a near significant decrease in OS was noted in patients whose tumours coexpressed ALDH1 and S100A4 (p = 0.065). Conclusion: Determination of EMT and CSC markers provides significant biological insights into breast PTs. These markers may promote new therapeutic paradigms in management, especially for malignant PTs. Objective: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is characterized by no specific molecular targeted agents. Nicotinamide has been proven to have protective effects in reducing the rate of skin cancer without toxicity. Method: The Illumina sequencing (Hiseq 2500) and iTRAQ LC-MS/MS techniques were employed for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, respectively, of TNBC cells treated with and without 25 mM nicotinamide. Obtained samples were utilized in network-based approaches to identify altered representative molecules of such pathways. In vitro functional tests were conducted to evaluate biologic functions in a cell.",

            "text": "Next generation proteomic analysis reveals suppression of Bmi-1 mediates molecular pathways for inhibiting tumour progression in triple negative breast cancer Objective: Bmi-1 has been correlated with tumour aggressiveness. Clinical trials with Bmi-1 inhibitors are currently underway. However, much still remains unknown regarding the landscape of genomics and proteomic molecular pathways in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is characterized by no specific molecular targeted agents. Method: We conducted proteomics of TNBC cells treated with or without a Bmi-1 siRNA by using the iTRAQ LC-MS/MS technique to identify differentially expressed proteins between the two groups. Enrichment analysis was conducted and biological network analysis was performed Finally, the selected proteins were validated for their clinical significance in a TNBC tissue microarray (n = 319). Results: Among the 7890 proteins identified, 722 differentially expressed proteins were obtained. By Panther analysis, 13 pathways, including those for kinases and the cell cycle, showed significant differential expression between the two groups. Pathway networks from functional interactions revealed tumour suppressive networks mediated by Bmi-1 suppression. Increased expression of Bmi-1 related proteins was related to aggressive clinical course. Conclusion: These findings shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying Bmi-1 by using proteomic analysis and provide pilot data necessary to support the role of Bmi-1 in TNBC and the application of a Bmi-1 inhibitor as a potential therapeutic to target TNBC. Objective: Initially, an inverse association was described between HER-2 positivity and the presence of hormonal receptor (HR), but subsequently it was reported that 50 % of the patients with HER-2 positive tumours are also HR positive. (J Natl Cancer Inst 2003; 95:142-153) (1), 6-9 (2), \u226510 (3). Final score for benign was \u22645, low grade malignant PT was 6-9 and \u226510 for high grade malignant PT. Both the WHO and modified system documented that after excluding incomplete excisions none of the benign PTs recurred. All 38 high grade PTs were equally classified by both systems, 7 PTs labeled as low grade by WHO were labeled as benign by modified system and two labeled as low grade by modified system were labeled as benign by WHO but none of discrepant cases had recurrence or death. A slightly better prediction of death was seen with modified system then traditional WHO classification. Conclusion: Though the WHO classification predicts events accurately, our study indicates that prediction may improve with addition of scores and heterogeneity and cellularity. Results: In all examined sections we discovered cells that were inside of another cells. With the help of scanning electron microscope the localization of internalized cell within \"cannibal\"-cell in homotypical CC was proven. Entosis is defined by invasion of one tumour cell inside the other, with forming of vacuole in cytoplasm of the absorbing cell. Internalized cell has a round shape. Internalized cell localizes inside gigantic vacuole in cytoplasm of a host-cell. Nucleus of a host-cell has a crescent form and dislocated to the periphery of cytoplasm. Later cells dissapear by means of lysosomal degradation. In some cases internalized cells undergo cell division within cannibal cell or they can be released. Entosis is provoked by the loss of attachment to extra-cellular matrix(ECM), that leads to internalization of one sell within the other by means of actin-myosin contraction. Generally, the result of entosis is a lysosome-mediated degradation of internalized cell or,in some cases their release from the host-cell. Objective: Immunohistochemical analysis of expression features, distribution and interaction of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin proteins in primary tumours of mammary gland. Method: Immunohistochemistry Results: In our test group there were 32 (n = 32) matching cases(primary mammary gland tumours) and their metastases in lymphatic nodes (n = 4) and liver (n = 8). Expression of Ecadherin, \u03b2-catenin in mammary gland cancer cells was defined by of immunohistochemical method with specific antibodies usage. In our resaerch we discovered that reduction and total absence of E-cadherin expression more frequently occured in mammary gland cancer patients with developed in different periods metastases in liver (70 %) than patients without metastases (30 %) (p = 0,014). The increase of cytoplasmic immunoreactivity and nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin was found in more than 80 % mammary gland cancer cases, following the development of metastases. Conclusion: These changes in E-cadherine and \u03b2-catenin expression in tumour cells can be considered as factors of unfavorable prognosis in mammary gland cancer. \u03b2-catenin expression appearance indicates signaling pathway activation, which is triggered by aberrant expression of epithelial cadherins, which leads to the increase of mobility and invasion of tumour cells. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of PD-L1 by 3 different immunohistochemical antibodies in TNBC.",

After NACh, the liver metastasis reduced to 10 mm by ultrasonography, and the patient underwent hepatectomy and breast lumpectomy. Histologically, a breast tumour bed with 6 mm with 5 % of overall cancer cellularity, and a 10 mm hepatocellular nodule with steatohepatitis and regenerative features, were found. Posterior radiologic evaluation of the liver confirmed the surgical excision of the metastatic nodule. The patient is alive and well 6 months after surgery. Conclusion: We illustrate a regenerative hepatic nodule as a form of total BCLM regression.

All were positive for GCDFP-15. Initial treatment was surgical (4 lumpectomy with radiotherapy and 1 mastectomy); sentinel lymph node was negative in all patients. One patient was submitted to additional chemotherapy and two to hormonotherapy. All remain diseasefree(median follow-up 36 months, range 21-108). Conclusion: SBC is a rare breast carcinoma with specific histological and genetic features, usually with favorable prognosis.

This study was aimed to identify histopathological features needed to differentiate those tumours and to verify whether using scoring system on those histological features will improve diagnostic accuracy in core biopsy. Method: 57 cases with paired core biopsy and excision/mastectomy with diagnosis of fibroadenoma and benign phyllodes tumour were included in this Study. Reassessment of histological features were done blindly, with and without scoring system, and excision/mastectomy served as the gold standard. Histopathologic features which assessed were stromal cellularity, nuclear atypia, tissue fragmentation, fat infiltration, mitotic figure, stromal heterogeneity. The scoring system were very mild (0), mild (1), moderate (2) for stromal cellularity and nuclear atypia; low (1), moderate (2), marked (3) for mitosis; none (1) and present (2) for fat infiltration, stromal heterogeneity and tissue fragmentation. Analytical statistic, diagnostic test and accuracy test were done. Results: Stromal cellularity, stromal heterogeneity and tissue fragmentation mostly found in benign phyllodes tumour compare to fibroadenoma (p = 0,001; p = 0,000; p = 0,021). The Specificity in scoring system increased by 17,9 % whereas positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy increased in scoring system (11,9 and 5,1 %) . Area under curve increased by 8,9 %. Conclusion: Scoring system improve the diagnosis accuracy of fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumour as shown by the increasing specificity, positive predictive value, accuracy and AUC. This can be used as reference to diagnose and differentiate fibroadenoma and benign phyllodes tumour especially in core biopsy. Results: Loss of E-cadherin expression was found in 2 (4 %) cases. We observed cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin staining in 16 (32 %) cases, p120-catenin-in 50 (100 %) cases. Coexpression of E-and P-cadherins was found in 48 (96 %) cases. The correlation was determined between \u03b2-catenin and p120-catenin (V = 0.32, p < 0.05), PR (V = 0.32, p < 0.05), HER-2 (V = 0.20, p < 0.05); p120-catenin and PR (V = 0.28, p < 0.05).",

Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate effects of acute, high glucose (HG, 20 mM)-induced changes in mitochondrial membrane potential on cardiomyocyte resistance to oxidative stress. Method: Metabolic effects of HG were tested in freshly isolated rat cardiomyocytes by measuring: oxygen consumption, NAD(P)H fluorometry, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential, opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and cell survival. Cells were preconditioned with isoflurane (APC). Results: HG increased oxygen consumption, NAD(P)H production and mitochondrial membrane potential, which indicated rapid metabolism of excess glucose by cardiomyocytes. This was associated with elevated production of ROS, accelerated opening of mPTP and increased H2O2-induced cell death. Uncoupling agent dinitrophenol reversed HG-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization, reduced ROS production and reversed cytotoxicity to cytoprotection by HG. Hyperosmotic mannitol control moderately elevated ROS production and exerted cytoprotection. HG prevented APC-induced mitochondrial depolarization and abrogated APC-induced cytoprotection. Conclusion: HG acutely hyperpolarizes mitochondria leading to excessive ROS production that is detrimental to cardiomyocytes and abolishes APC. Reduction of ROS production by preventing mitochondrial hyperpolarization exerts cytoprotection probably via small amount of ROS that trigger preconditioning.",

Implementation of new surgery interventional methods of treatment requires to diagnose degree of involvement cardiac remodeling in thanatogenesis. The aim of our study is objectivization and documentation special morphological aspects of cardiac remodeling due to hypoxic, ischemic and diabetic cardiopathy. Method: Autopsy material of hearts from newborns (n = 35), under-1 children (n = 32) with hypoxic cardiopathy, from patients 65-75-yearsold, died from ischemic (n = 37) and diabetic (n = 35) cardiopathy was analyzed. Comparison groups were hearts of newborns (n = 6), under-1 children (n = 4) and 60-76-years-old adults (n = 9), who were died from accidents resulting in injuries. Macroscopic investigation, separately weighing, computer morphometry and 3D-modelling were performed. Results: Total heart weight and sizes were significantly enlarged in relation to the same parameters in comparison groups, but cardiac remodelling is performed by different heart chambers: in cases of hypoxic cardiopathy in newborns and under-1 children-by right ventricle, in cases of hypoxic cardiopathy in adults-by left ventricle realized in dilatation type, in cases of diabetic cardiopathy in adults-by left ventricle realized in hypertrophic type. Conclusion: 3D-modelling offers the possibility to get significant dates, to prognose type of cardiopathy and estimate its involvement in thanatogenesis. Results: In all patients there was a sharp increase of the SHG signal at the outer layers. In dissected aortas this region formed the external border of the blood channel. Furthermore, in these patients we noticed an important loss of SHG signals in all layers. Conclusion: Non-centrosymmetric collagen might be an important element for the srenght and resistance of the aorta. During dissection the outer layers prevent complete vessel rupture, probably due to their increased content of non-centrosymmetric collagen. The overall decreased content of SHG-collagen in dissected aortas might be the cause, but also the consequence of the dissection process.",

Prognosis and treatment of P-NET depend on tumour grade, defined by mitotic count (MC) and/or Ki-67 proliferation index (KI). We compared different techniques evaluating these factors, to define the most time effective one. Method: 42 P-NET were retrospectively analysed. MC was assessed in 50HPF (10HPF = 2 mm 2 ) and reported as an average number of mitosis in 2 mm 2 . KI was counted manually on 2000 tumour cells. We evaluated inter-observer agreement for both methods, correlation between the two methods, correlation between both methods and KI assessed on a printed picture. Each method was timed. Results: Among 392 papillary carcinomas, we identified 29 Papillary microcarcinomas with extracapsular extension in 8 males and 21 females (mean age = 55 years). Tumour's size varied between 3 and 10 mm (mean = 8). All tumours were stage pT3a, nine bilateral and 15 multifocal. Vascular invasion and lymph node metastases were seen in 2 and 9 cases respectively. Tumour was encapsulated in 4 cases. Follicular structures and oncocytic features were seen in 20 and 9 cases respectively. Lymphocytic thyroiditis was observed in 13 cases. V600E-BRAF mutation was identified in all tested tumours (7/7 cases). One patient had early recurrence in regional lymph nodes. All patients are alive without evidence of thyroid cancer at 5 months-11 years of follow-up. Conclusion: Papillary thyroid microcarcinomas with extracapsular extension represent 7 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas in our series. This tumour is rarely encapsulated and can be associated with vascular invasion and lymph node metastases. V600E mutation is common. However, patient's prognosis seems to be excellent.

Method: Eleven AT-FNAs, corresponding to the Bethesda diagnostic categories II (n = 4), III (n = 2), IV (n = 3) and VI (n = 2) were included in our study (one smear/case). The DNA extraction protocol was based on a precipitation method (MasterPureTM DNA purification kit, Epicentre), according to the manufacturer instructions and optimized in our laboratory. All cases were subject to RT-PCR amplification and high resolution melting analysis for a housekeeping gene (GAPDH) and for BRAF gene, respectively. Results: We successfully isolated good quantity and purity DNA from all our cases (mean concentration 62.47 \u00b1 37.55 ng/\u03bcl; mean purity: 1.47 \u00b1 0.13).

A persistent disease status at the last oncological assessment and tumour recurrence were more frequent among patients with NE-FVPTCs (8.2 %, p = 0.046 and 0.9 %, p = 0.255, respectively). Only 1 patient (a case of NE-FVPTC) developed distant metastasis during follow-up (mean 66 months). Conclusion: NE-FVPTCs seem to present and behave in a more aggressive fashion, compared to E-FVPTCs. Understanding the differences between these entities will probably help guiding treatment strategies in the future.",

Conclusion: GFAP and protein S100 expression in tumour cells from pituitary adenomas depend on the hormone profile. We support the presence of two molecular subtypes of FS cells, GFAP+/VEGF+/S100 and GFAP-/S100+/EGFR+, simultaneously with the classical GFAP+/S100+ variant. S100+/EGFR+ pituitary adenomas may represent a unique group of aggressive tumours, highly capable of invasion and recurrence. Results: Thirty of 58 patients are Grade1, 10 Grade2, 10 Grade3 NET according to WHO2010 classification and 8 don't have residue tumour in resection material. Lymph node metastasis is observed in 13,3 % (4 cases) of G1NET cases. In these four cases with lymph node metastasis, the diameter of tumour is over 1 cm in three of them and the other smaller than 1 cm is invading to submucosa. Also age and male-to-female ratio are increasing with the increase in tumour stage. Four of 10 (%40) G2NET cases with closer Ki-67 proliferation index (%2-%5) to threshold between G1-G2 have lower stage. Conclusion: From this perspective, tumour diameter and depth of invasion are the points to consider in endoscopic follow-up process. In 2010 WHO classification the threshold for G1 and G2 distinction has a very narrow range, so it is needed to revise it again and reform the treatment algorithms.",

FoxA1 is reported to have oncogenic and tumour suppressive roles depending on tumour type. In thyroid, FoxA1 expression has recently been shown in C cells and medullary carcinoma (MTC) but not in follicular cells. FoxA1 has also been proposed as potential oncogene in anaplastic carcinoma (ATC). However, FoxA1 expression has not been extensively investigated in a spectrum of thyroid tumours. Method: 62 MTCs were stained with anti-FoxA1 antibody, and its expression pattern was compared with those of other conventional markers. FoxA1 was also performed on a variety of thyroid tumours. Objective: To identify by means of proteomic profiling novel prognostic biomarkers in lung carcinoids. Method: Two-dimensional electrophoresis was applied to screen differential proteomic profiles in typical (H727) and atypical (H720) lung carcinoid cell lines, and the most relevant differentially expressed proteins were identified using mass spectrometry (Maldi-TOF). Four of these latter (GSTP-1, HSP27, peroxiredoxin-2 and calreticulin), selected based on their biological properties and potential role in carcinogenesis, were validated using immunohistochemistry in a large cohort of 89 lung carcinoid paraffin embedded samples. Results: Over 150 proteins were differentially expressed in H727 as compared to H720 cells. Among these, 57 were identified by MaldiTOF and belonged to several cellular pathways. Among the four validated using immunohistochemistry, low GSTP-1, high nuclear HSP27 and low peroxiredoxin-2 expression were significantly associated with shorter survival at univariate analysis (all p < 0.02) and two of them with aggressive disease status (low GSTP-1, p < 0.001; high nuclear HSP27, p = 0.003).

In endemic areas, a differential diagnosis of hydatid disease should be considered for cystic masses in any location. Results: We had a total of 10 patients between the ages of 30-64 (average age 46,3), 4 of them were men and the others were women. The cysts outside of liver and lung were frequently seen in intramuscular (3/10), spleen (3/10), bone (2/10), kidney (1/10), retroperitoneal (1/10). The most frequent symptom in our patients was a progressive painless swelling for intramuscular cysts. The average cyst size was 7.8 cm. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis in all of the cases. Recurrence was seen in an intrabony lesion. Conclusion: Hydatid disease is still a serious public health problem in our country. Its clinical presentations vary depending on the involvement of the organ and the size of the cysts. The diagnosis is often suggested by radiology and confirmed by the pathological examination. Laparotomy showed right colonic mass with multiple lymphadenopathy. Right hemicolectomy was done and the specimen was sent for histopathology. The gross examination revealed thickening of the colonic wall with multiple lymph nodes ranging in size between 3 and 0.5 cm in maximum dimension. Microscopy showed a colonic wall with extensive infiltration by eosinophils and fungal hyphae surrounded by eosinophilic material and granulomatous inflammation (Splendore Hoeppli phenomenon). The fungal hyphae were positive to Periodic acid Schiff and Gomori's methenamine silver stains. Features were consistent with basidiobolomycosis, which was confirmed by microbiology. The two cases were treated by voricocanazole. Conclusion: Abdominal Basidiobolomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with fast growing abdominal mass and fever. Results: Out of 205 participants, 24 (11.7 %) were positive for Anti-HCV in which 13 (6.3 %) were male and 11 (5.3 %) were females. On the other hand 12 (5.8 %) were positive for HBsAg in which 9 (4.3 %) were males and 3 (1.4 %) were females. Whereas only 1 (0.4 %) was positive for both Anti-HCV & HBsAg. Out of these 24 Anti-HCV positive samples 17 (8.2 %) were also positive for HCV by PCR in which 8 were males (3.9 %) & 9 (4.3 %) were females & on the other hand out of 12 HBsAg positive samples 9 (4.3 %) samples were also positive for HBV by PCR in which 7 (3.4 %) were males & 2 (0.9 %) were females. Only 1 (0.4 %) sample were positive for both HCV & HBV by PCR. Conclusion: Our results indicates very high prevalence of HCV & HBV in this region. Which needs to be address immediately. Another interesting finding of this study is that the frequency of these infections are more in males as compare to females which might be due to the fact that males are more exposed to the high risk activities. Objective: Parasitic diseases, according to WHO, in more than 32 % of cases are the causes of deaths. In recent years, in the Republic of Kazakhstan a steady increase in the incidence of echinococcosis were noted (up to 1000 or more cases per year). We studied 215 cases of surgically treated liver echinococcosis. One hundred and seventy-nine patients were operated by traditional methods with an impact on residual cavity by various antiseptics. Thirty-six patients underwent an echinococcectomy with cavern sanitation by a physical method that we developed, with the use of underwater electrical discharge.

Conclusion: Severe SOS and NRH are not frequent yet they are present. The only predictive factors for SOS, NRH, BL and/or hepatic insufficiency seems to be OX and the type of surgery performed. Surgeons should have special attention regarding these findings for recurred CLM. Results: Nuclear expression of EpICD significantly correlated with nuclear expression of \u03b2-catenin, and Ki-67 labeling index. In addition, nuclear expression of EpICD was associated with higher histologic grade and advanced T category. Forced overexpression of EpICD using EpICD cDNA in the HCC cell significantly increased the cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The overexpression of EpICD also increased the expression levels of the active form of \u03b2-catenin and c-myc and cyclin D1. Conversely, silencing of EpCAM by siRNA decreased the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and the expression of active form of \u03b2catenin, c-myc and cyclin D1.

Although this tumour is not very common, based on literature data it is characterised by favourable overall survival. During the 2 years follow-up despite immunosuppressive therapy-without additional courses of chemotherapy-the patient did not show any evidence of tumour progression. Objective: Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a multifunctional neuropeptide which seems to play an immunomodulatory role in different inflammatory processes. Indeed, in a model of rheumatoid arthritis (known to be an autoimmune disease), the administration of ADM, reduced inflammatory damage and restored immune tolerance, by acting on regulatory T lymphocytes. This study aimed to evaluate the expression and the role of ADM in chronic inflammatory liver diseases (CILD), aspects that have never been investigated so far. Method: We assessed, by means of immunohistochemistry, the tissue expression of ADM in normal liver (10 cases) and in a series of 49 CILD, including 22 autoimmune and 27 viral, type C, hepatitis. Results: In normal liver, ADM was strongly and diffusely expressed in sinusoidal lining cells and in the hepatocytes. In CILD, ADM expression was less extensive and weaker in most cases. In particular, reduced ADM expression in sinusoidal cells was significantly associated with the autoimmune etiology (p = 0.01). Furthermore, a weaker sinusoidal expression of ADM significantly correlated with a more severe necro-inflammatory damage (p = 0.04).",

Objective: Our study focuses on the investigation of angiogenic process in liver primary and recurrent metastases secondary to colorectal cancer. Method: 24 cases including eight with recurrent metastases occurred after a previous treatment by thermonecrosis (group 1) and 16 with primary metastases treated exclusively by surgery (group 2) were immunohistochemically investigated using anti-CD31 antibody. Microvessels density (MVD) was quantified in 5 hot-spots, separately in intratumoural and peritumoural areas; a mean value was calculated for each case and group. Student's t-test was used for all statistical comparisons. Results: In group 1, intratumoural MVD was 30.58 \u00b1 13.16, and peritumoural 58.33 \u00b1 23.41, whereas in group 2 intratumoural MVD was 22.26 \u00b1 9.12, and peritumoural 85.03 \u00b1 34.68, with statistically significant differences intratumoural versus peritumoural for both groups (p = 0.01, and p < 0.0001, respectively). In addition, the comparison between group 1 and group 2 revealed significant differences in MVD only for peritumoural areas (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our data points out the differences in angiogenic profile between recurrent and primary metastases. Peritumoural MVD mean values, lower in group 1, could be interpreted as a failure of angiogenic potential in metastatic recurrent disease, subsequently to the biological changes induced in tumour liver environment by thermonecrosis. Objective: Introduction: Fibronectin glomerulopathy is a rare genetic disease which can lead to renal failure and is characterized by proteinuria, hematuria and hypertension. Inheritance is autosomal dominant and the occurrence is more frequent in the third or fourth decade of life, but can affect any age group and both gender. The demonstration of fibronectin glomerular deposits in kidney biopsy is essential for diagnosis. In this article, we add to the literature two cases of fibronectin glomerulopathy that occurred in father and son, both with nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and hematuria. Method: CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old male, with nephrotic syndrome during 8 months associated with hematuria (1 + / 4 +), normal serum creatinine (0.73 mg / dl) and blood pressure of 165 \u00d7 100 mmHg. Renal biopsy showed all glomeruli with endocapillary hypercellularity, especially at the expense of mesangial cells, associated with large amount of eosinophilic/fuccinophilic deposits, negative to silver and Sirius-Red stains, in the mesangium and subendothelial in capillary loops, with some foci of basal membrane duplication. Congo Red staining for \u03b2-amyloid was negative. Immune research by immunofluorescence was negative. Electron microscopy showed large amount of eletrondense deposits, which in high power field, had fine granular appearance, located especially in mesangial and subendothelial in capillary loops, with rare subepithelial deposits. It was suspected of fibronectin glomerulopathy due to the characteristics and location of deposits. The immunohistochemistry for fibronectin was marked positive and immunostaining coincided with mesangial and capillary loops deposits. Thus, the case was diagnosed as fibronectin glomerulopathy. The patient was treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Three years later, his renal function remained stable and 24 h proteinuria was varying between 3.0 and 5.0 g. Two years after the diagnosis of his son, the 24-h proteinuria research in the parent was 5.0 g and serum creatinine was 1.2 mg / dl. Scrutiny of 4 years ago already showed 24 h proteinuria of 4.98 g, but he had not a nephrology follow up. Also, there was hematuria and hypertension treated with angiotensin receptor blocker. Renal biopsy showed the same morphological findings of his son. Treatment was instituted with Losartan 100 mg; however proteinuria levels was the same up to date, 3 months after the biopsy. Results: DISCUSSION: These cases document the familial occurrence of fibronectin glomerulopathy. This entity was first described in 1980, with the name \"familial glomerulopathy with giant fibrillary deposits\" due to diffuse deposits, subendothelial, but often transmembranous and mesangial. In 1995, it was demonstrated deposits immunoreactivity to fibronectin and the disease was called \"familiar glomerulonephritis with fibronectin deposits\". In 2008, it was associated with mutations in the gene encoding fibronectin (FN1), located in 2q34, which occurs in 40 % of cases of disease. Objective: Single kidney is one of the relative contraindication to renal biopsy. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of glomerular lesion from non-neoplastic portion of the nephrectomy specimen. Method: We examined a total of 97 patients with nephrectomy from urologic neoplasm for 6 years. Twenty-one cases were excluded because of end stage renal disease. The light microscopic findings of 76 cases of non-neoplastic kidney were evaluated, with immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopic examination. The mean age of patients was 62.1 years and the male to female ratio was 54:22. The diagnoses of neoplasm included 65 cases of renal cell carcinoma, 9 cases of urothelial cell carcinoma, one case of angiomyolipoma, and one case of hemangioma.",

Method: Five murine models of renal injury were analysed for K17expression using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Human non-fibrotic and fibrotic kidney were investigated using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Results: In healthy murine kidneys showed no K17 expression. In response to injury K17 was expressed de novo in tubular cells, first in single cells which expanded and later on marked whole tubular cross-sections of collecting duct and distal tubules. Parietal epithelial cells (PECs) also showed de novo expression in a glomerular injury model. K17 did not co-localize with markers of tubular injury or proliferation. In healthy human kidneys, K17 was expressed at the basolateral side of distal tubular cells. This changed to a circumferential type of expression in response to renal injury. PECs, which were negative in healthy kidneys, showed strong K17 positivity in cases with periglomerular fibrosis. In fetal human kidney K17 was expressed in ureteric bud segments in a circumferential manner similar to disease state. Conclusion: We show that K17 is expressed de novo in response to renal injury in mice and in human glomeruli and marks a specific subpopulation of tubular cells. Objective: Importance of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway has been already recognized in cell culture experiments and in animal models of kidney fibrosis. However, there is lack of evidence with regard to significance of TGF-\u03b2 effectors (SMAD2, SMAD3, SNAIL) in nephrotic syndrome of humans and their relations to clinico-pathological parameters. Method: Clinical and histopathological characteristics of 50 kidney biopsies were analyzed with respect to expression and distribution of SMAD2, SMAD3 and SNAIL molecules, detected by immunohistochemistry, in order to investigate the relevance of TGF-\u03b2 effectors detection in kidney biopsies of patients with nephrotic syndrome and isolated proteinuria.",

Conclusion: Expression of TGF-\u03b2 downstream effectors SMAD2 and SNAIL in kidney biopsies represent immunomorphological substrate of chronic kidney parenchymal damage, correlating with higher proteinuria levels and decreased excretory kidney function. Objective: The Royal College of Pathologists supports a competency based framework for independent reporting of histology and cytology specimens. This is achieved using graded responsibilities, roughly intended to correlate with each year of training. The aim of this project was to assess the awareness and attitudes of current histopathology trainees towards such independent reporting. Method: Prospectively administered structured questionnaire of histopathology trainees in the London training region. Results: 54 histopathology trainees responded to the questionnaire. Seventy-five percent were aware of the concept, but only 39 % were aware of the Royal College document. Awareness and use of the document increased with seniority but the majority were not yet reporting independently (78 %). Many trainees reported they would feel ready to start reporting independently following completion of Part 1 of the fellowship exam for the Royal College of Pathologists (48 %), but nearly a quarter would like to start earlier than this (24 %). Conclusion: Although most trainees are aware of the concept of graded responsibility for reporting independently, only 22 % are reporting independently. Uptake of independent reporting needs the backing of the consultant body within the department, but most trainees are keen to participate.",

IgG4: IgG ratio was high ( 40 %; 50 plasma cells/HPF). Organ involvement included: pancreas, kidneys, spleen, lungs, heart valves, meninges. Diabetes was caused through fibrotic islet destruction. No signs of pulmonary asbestosis were found. Pleural plaque-like fibrotic areas were present. A thrombulcerative endocarditis of the mitral valve enhanced the preexisting hypertensive cardiac failure. Conclusion: In patients with unusual clinical manifestations and seemingly unrelated organ damage a high suspicion for IgG4-related disease as linking disorder is warranted. This case is notable as the first report of IgG4-related endocarditis with meningeal involvement and death in septic shock caused by multi-organ targeting of IgG4-related disease mistaken as an insurance case of asbestosis related disease, demonstrating the value of a postmortem analysis. Objective: Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT, oncothermia) generates electric field which can interfere with malignant tumours at 42\u00b0C resulting in low energy density destruction of neoplastic cells. The tumour selectivity of mEHT is due to increased metabolite content and permittivity of tumours compared to normal tissues. In vitro 3D tumour cell cultures mimicking tissue complexity better than cell monolayers were used to test mEHT induced tumour cell death and stress responses. Method: C26 mouse colorectal carcinoma cells were grown in Matrigel scaffolding (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumour matrix) in LabTek and treated in four groups using: 1) conventional hyperthermia at 42\u00b0C (HT); 2) mEHT with non-contact electrodes, 3) mEHT with contact electrodes and 4) no treatment (control) at 37\u00b0C. Results: Both mEHT and HT treatments induced chromatin condensation and apoptotic bodies seen in H&E-stained formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded culture sections. TUNEL assay confirmed apoptosis related DNA fragmentation. The expression of heat stress induced Hsp60 and Hsp70 proteins showed a decreasing gradient in mEHT>HT>control direction. Also, both mEHT and HT treatments resulted in elevated Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels.",

Conclusion: Cell agglutination of biologic material in formaldehyde is a cheap, quicker and accurate way to obtain cell-block, allowing ancillary studies and improving diagnosis capacity. Results: Our findings show a significant degree of morphologic overlap between reactive and malignant cells. 'Exploding' mitotic figures, nuclear membrane irregularities, multi-nucleation and cytoplasmic vacuolation were reactive features commonly present in negative fluid specimens, presenting potential pitfalls to accurate diagnosis. The most discriminating feature that favored malignant cells was increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, the presence of increased eosinophils and 'pseudoparakeratotic cells' were helpful clues indicating prior IPChT. Conclusion: Post-IPChT peritoneal fluid specimens pose unique diagnostic challenges. Awareness of the extent and spectrum of atypical features exhibited by benign constituents, coupled with the judicious use of immunocytochemistry are key to accurate cytologic interpretation. Objective: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is the recommended sampling procedure for solid pancreatic cancer. There are no guidelines about the sampling and processing techniques, therefore, they vary substantially across medical centers. Method: We aimed to compare the diagnostic yield of samples obtained with stylet or suction in 75 prospectively enrolled patients with pancreatic masses. The number of smears, cellularity and bloodiness were assessed, and considering our results, we established a recommendation for sampling. Objective: Despite the cell block be considered a diagnostic method of wide applicability in routine practice, the indication of each method according to the different types and aspects of cytological samples is not well established. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the plasma-thromboplastin (PT) method in pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, cerebrospinal fluids, peritoneal and bronchoalveolar lavage, urine and aspirated cystic lesions. Method: Conventional smear, cell block and immunocytochemistry were prepared for each cytological sample (n = 299). Results: The PT method was applicable in samples without sediment or small amount of sediment and with sediment of blood, 88.3 % of the samples. Samples with large amount of sediment and anticoagulant (11.7 %) were prepared by agar method. Adequate cellularity and cellular distribution with preservation of the morphology of groups and cells were observed in both methods. The immunocytochemical staining pattern was similar to that usually observed in conventional smears. Agreement was observed in 96.9 %, between the diagnoses of cell block and conventional smears. In some samples, cancer was detected only by cell block. Conclusion: The plasma-thromboplastin method is applicable in most samples, has high diagnostic agreement with conventional smears and may decrease the false-negatives of cytological analyses.",

Diagnostic dilemma to differentiate secondary from primary thyroid mimickers occurred when clinical information was unavailable. This study is to explore cytomorphology of these cases. Method: Thyroid FNAs, performed during January 2007 and March 2016 at Chiang Mai University Hospital, Thailand, were retrieved under diagnoses of \"metastatic cancer\", \"metastatic cancer cannot be excluded\" or \"primary versus metastasis\". Cytological slides were reviewed along with their histologic correlates and clinical data. Results: Out of 2444 thyroid FNAs, 20 with definite or equivocal diagnoses of metastatic tumours were encountered. Eight of which were confirmed to have metastatic nature. These include 1 squamous cell carcinoma from tonsil, 1 osteosarcoma, 3 pulmonary adenocarcinoma, 1 hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 endocervical adenocarcinoma and 1 unknown primary. Two metastatic cases were presented without prior clinical cancer history. Primary thyroid mimickers include anaplastic, medullary and papillary carcinomas.

She was evaluated by a Pap smear first. Her Pap smear revealed irregular and discohesive cell groups that had ill defined and transparent cytoplasm, peripherally located nuclei, vesicular chromatin and, conspicious nucleoli. There was no spindle cell component seen. The Pap smear was diagnosed as AGC, NOS. Results: On pathological examination of the endometrial curettage and following hysterectomy specimen, the tumour was diagnosed as mullerian adenosarcoma. Detailed examination of the sarcomatous component revealed the remarkable resemblance of the cells that was seen on Pap smear.

The average of outer dynein arm was 1.2, inner dynein arm 0.9 and nexin link 3.9, and orientation was varying. Ultrastructural analysis showed PCD. Conclusion: The diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome is not difficult to suspect. The difficulty is to keep this diagnosis in mind since the symptoms are non-specific.

High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma was the dominant subtype. Median age was 51 years (range 45-68). Among women found to have occult sarcoma, hysterectomies was performed as a primary indication for leiomyomas (75 %) and abnormal bleeding (25 %). There was no evidence of malignancy in the preoperative histologic examination of the endometrium of these patients. Of these 12 patients, 9 were treated by open hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. 3 of these patients underwent total laparascopic hysterectomy. Conclusion: As a result, the total incidence of uterine sarcoma among patients operated on for benign indication is low in our population (0.37 % or 1 in 270). The FDA estimates that 0.3 % of all women undergoing hysterectomy for the treatment of myomas are found to have an unexpected uterine sarcoma. No reliable predictors of uterine sarcoma present and attention is warranted in preoperative planning for hysterectomy. Objective: An increasing number of extra-colonic neoplasms are being described in Lynch Syndrome patients. Uveal melanoma is not included in Lynch Syndrome tumour spectrum, despite evidence suggesting a role of microsatellite instability in its sporadic tumourigenesis. In this work we aim to describe a patient with Lynch Syndrome that presented an ovarian uveal melanoma metastasis. Method: The patient was referred for genetic counseling at 45 years-old due to a family history of Lynch Syndrome (MLH1 mutated). She underwent enucleation of her right eye at age 25 due to a uveal melanoma which recurred as an ovarian metastasis 22 years later.

Tested antibodies: ER, PR, p53, Ki-67, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6, ARID1A, stathmin, IMP3, L1CAM, PTEN, beta-catenin, p16. Results: Overall, 2.0 mm cores were more assessable for evaluation than 0.6 mm cores (95.7 % versus 77.5 %, p < 0.001). Most antibodies had a substantial to good agreement between hysterectomy TMA and whole slide, with exception of those with heterogeneous expression: PR, Ki-67, stathmin, beta-catenin, p16. Preoperative TMAs showed for most antibodies moderate to perfect agreement with hysterectomy TMAs. There were more cases with positive staining on preoperative TMA and negative hysterectomy TMA than conversely.",

The aim of our study was to analyze SOX2 expression along with copy number changes in a large set of vulvar carcinomas. Method: For immunohistochemical detection of SOX2, we used a rabbit monoclonal anti-SOX2 antibody (clone EPR3131, Epitomics Inc.). Copy number changes of SOX2 were analyzed by commercially available probes according standard procedures (Zytovision, ZytoLight SPEC SOX2/CEN3). Analysis of the HPV status was done with RNA in situ hybridization, utilizing specific probes against pan HPV (ViewRNA, Affymetrix Inc.). Results: SOX2 was immunohistological detectable in 30/55 (54.5 %) specimens. Amplification of SOX2 was observed in 10/48 (20.8 %) specimens with a valid FISH signal. Furthermore, SOX2 overexpression and amplification were both strongly related to positive HPV status. Tumours which were positive with pan HPV probes in RNA in situ hybridization showed significantly more frequent high SOX2 expression levels as well as amplification than tumours not associated to HPV (57 vs. 18 %, p < 0.01 and 40 vs. 9.5 %, p = 0.02). Conclusion: SOX2 overexpression and amplification is strongly related to HPV associated vulvar carcinomas. Our results may give new insights in the molecular pathogenesis of HPV related vulvar cancers. Objective: The diagnostic issues raised by primary ovarian mucinous tumours (POMT) are of two types: the exclusion of metastasis and the grading. The aims of our work were to determine whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) may assist in tumour grading and provide a simple tool to differentiate between primary and metastastic mucinous ovarian tumours. Method: We studied 29 cases: 12 metastasis and 17 POMT, including 7 cystadenomas, 6 borderline tumours and 4 carcinomas, in a prospective study performed between 2014 and 2015. Objective: In cytology specimens, parakeratotic cells are either isolated or in sheets and resemble small superficial squamous cells. The cytoplasm, however, is more dense than a normal superficial squamous cell, and the nuclei can be more hyperchromatic with variation in size and shape.",

IL-10 may be valuable as a prognostic marker in ovarian carcinoma but still more studies on larger sample size is needed for its validation. Objective: Uterine sex cord stromal tumours are rare, and are divided into endometrial stromal tumours with sex cord like elements (ESTSCLE), and Uterine tumours resembling ovarian sex cord tumours (UTROSCT). The aim of the study is to see histomorphological features of uterine sex cord stromal tumours. Method: From January 2004 to Mid April 2016, we found 8 cases of uterine stromal tumours in our files (3-ESTSCLE, 4-UTROSCT, and one was labelled as mixed stromal-smooth muscle tumour with true sex cord differentiation). Results: The mean age was 39.3 years (median 38). All ESTSCLE showed typical low grade ESS areas with sex cord elements in trabecular/retifrom pattern. All were positive for ER,PR, CD10. One case had history of carcinoma breast; the same case also showed paraaortic lymph node metastasis. All URTOSCT showed nests, cords, trabeculae. Calretinin, inhibin, MIC-2 were used as sex cord markers (MIC-2 being positive in \u00be cases). EMA was consistently negative. One case showed aortocaval, pelvic nodal metastasis; another showed necrosis, mitotic count of 20/10 hpf and was deemed malignant. Conclusion: ESTSCLE and UTROSCT are rare uterine tumours. The former behaves as low grade sarcoma; whereas the later, should also be regarded as low grade malignant tumour. Follow up is required.

Nine months after the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, multiple metastasis to liver, lymph nodes and skin developed and the patient died 2 years after the first diagnosis. Conclusion: SCT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of presacral tumours in adult age group. Complete resection and close followup is crucial for the patient management due to its rare but fatal consequences. Objective: Main objective of the study was to define whether endometrial expression of HOXA-10, HOXA-11 and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) with its receptor (LIF-R) is significantly different between fertile and infertile women during implantation window. Method: >Women having delivered at least one alive newborn were the study's control group (fertile, group 1) while infertile women the patients' group (infertile, group 2). An endometrial biopsy was obtained on 7th-8th postovulatory day. Expression of HOXA-10, HOXA-11, LIF and LIF-R was assessed in both epithelial and stromal cells by immunohistochemistry. Primary outcome was h-score. Results: Endometrial tissue was obtained by 20 fertile and 55 infertile women (22 with poor ovarian reserve, 13 with tubal infertility, 5 with endometriosis and 15 with unexplained infertility). Mean age was 31.1 + \u22124.8 years for group 1 and 37.5 + \u22123.8 for group 2 (P = .001). LIF and LIF-R h-score was significantly decreased in epithelial cells of infertile women compared with fertile controls (P = .05 and P = .006 respectively). No significant difference was observed regarding HOXA-10 and HOXA-11 epithelial endometrial expression as well as stromal expression of all molecules between two groups. LIF, LIF-R and HOXA-11 epithelial hscore presented their lowest values in women with unexplained infertility. Conclusion: Endometrial expression of LIF, LIF-R and HOXA-11 but not HOXA-10 is significantly impaired in women with unexplained infertility during implantation window. Our results indicate the significant role of HOXA-11, LIF and LIF-R in the aitiopathogenetic drawback complex of unexplained infertility. Objective: Main objective was to study whether endometrial expression of Progesterone receptors type A and B and integrins avb3 differ significantly between fertile and infertile as well as within sub-groups of infertility during implantation window. Method: Women having delivered at least one alive newborn during the last year consisted the control group (group 1) while infertile the patients' group (group 2). Infertile were also categorized to those with ovarian failure (group 2a), tubal factor (group 2b), endometriosis (2c) or unexplained infertility (group 2d). Endometrial biopsy was obtained by Pipelle on 7th-8th postovulatory day. Total progesterone receptors' (TPR), type-B receptors' (PRB) and integrins' avb3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Primary outcome was h-score. Results: Endometrial tissue was obtained by 20 fertile and 55 infertile women. Mean age was 31.1 \u00b1 4.8 years for group 1 and 37.5 \u00b1 3.8 for group 2 (P = .001). TPR and PRB expression was significantly decreased in epithelial cells of infertile women compared with fertile. No significant difference was observed in the epithelial expression of integrins avb3 (P = .52). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed regarding the expression of any biomarker in stromal cells. When adjusting for the cause of infertility, TPR and PRB epithelial expression were significantly decreased in sub-groups 2a and 2d. Conclusion: Progesterone receptors' but not integrins' expression is significantly decreased in epithelial cells of women with unexplained infertility and poor ovarian reserve.

Method: 150 patients (195 FTs) with extraovarian pathology (n = 30) and ovarian tumours (n = 120) were recruited. All fimbrial parts of FTs were investigated extensively. FTs were investigated morphologically and immunohistochemically (p53,Ki-67,PgR,E-cadherin). Student test with Bonferroni correction was used for statistics. Results: 378 TPJ were verified. 40,6 % TPJ involved endosalpingeal plicae(43,6 % of them localized on the top of plica, 25,6 %-on the side of plica, 30,8 %-between plicae). Histologically TPJ was flat (52,1 %) convex (40,6 %), concave (7,3 %). Lymphatic/ blood vessels dilatation was diagnosed in most TPJ (closed to the basal membrane). Transition metaplasia was revealed in 33 %, Walthard nests-in 25 %, \"ovarian\" stroma adjunct to TPJ-in 2 % (out of TPJ-in 20 %). Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) was diagnosed in patients with serous carcinoma (in 30 %). In 53,3 % of patients STIC was revealed adjunct to TPJ, in 33,3 %-in the fimbrial part of FT (out of TPJ), in 13,3 %-out of fimbrial part (p < 0,05). Conclusion: TPJ is supposed to be an analogue of the transition zones in other organs (gastro-esophageal, cervical squamo-columnar). Proximity of STIC to TPJ in most cases proved the hypothesis about TPJ to be a \"hot spot\" for pelvic high-grade serous ovarian carcinogenesis.

The most commonly reported mesenchymal malignancies were leiomyosarcoma (8 cases) associated to rhabdomyosarcoma, adenosarcoma and undifferenciated sarcoma reported with almost equal frequency (1 case). Conclusion: Each of the aforementioned lesions is associated with a relatively distinct clinicopathologic profile. Distinction between these entities is important because therapeutic care and prognosis differ, and each case must be evaluated within the context of the reported cases of that specific histologic subtype.",

HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are promising therapeutic agents. We aim to characterize HDAC1,2,3,4,6 and PhosphoHDAC4/5/7(PhosphoHDAC) immunoprofiles in the different morphological components of uterine carcinosarcomas(UCS) and its association with clinicopathological parameters. Method: HDAC1,2,3,4,6 and PhosphoHDAC immunohistochemistry was performed in tissue microarrays using 55 UCS and 17 UCS metastases from 55 patients(462 cores). Quantitative and qualitative score were evaluated and combined into an immunoreactivity score. Results: HDAC1,2,3,4 and 6 were expressed in the majority of tumours[HDAC2(80 %) > HDAC4(78 %) > HDAC1(71 %) > HDAC3(55 %) > HDAC6(53 %)], albeit with different immunoreactivity mean scores[HDAC4(7.04) > HDAC2(6.25) > HDAC1(5.15) > HDAC3(4.44) > HDAC6(2.84)]. There was a strong positive significant correlation of expression of HDAC1,2 and 3 between the epithelial and mesenchymal components(rs > 0,5, p < 0,001), although immunoreactivity scores of HDAC1, PhosphoHDAC(cyt) and HDAC6 were significantly higher in the epithelial component (p < 0,05). A strong positive correlation between the expression of HDAC3 and HDAC1,2 and 4 and between phosphoHDAC and HDAC1 and 4 (rs > 0.5, p < 0.001) was found. Increased expression of HDAC4 in the mesenchymal component was independently associated with an improved overall survival on univariate analysis (p < 0.05). Objective: To examine sites and patterns of disease in low-stage tuboovarian high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). FIGO staging encompasses primary site ascertainment (tubal/ovarian/peritoneal). This is difficult in advanced cases where multiple sites are involved. Less than 10 % of extrauterine HGSC present at stage I/II. Early stage cases allow assessment of disease before wide dissemination, with implications for specimen handling, staging and site assignment. Method: Anonymised pathology reports of 67 Stage I and II HGSCs from 6 teaching hospitals were analysed. Stage, sites/pattern of involvement, site/size of largest focus and laterality of tubal and ovarian involvement were recorded. Results: Ovarian involvement without any tubal component was only present in 12/67 (18 %). Bilateral ovarian involvement (66 %) was significantly higher than bilateral tubal involvement (13 %) (p = 0.012, Fisher's exact test). There is a trend towards fewer stage I compared to stage II tumours in this study in comparison with historic series. Conclusion: Identification of tubal disease in 82 % cases, and significantly higher bilateral (suggesting metastasis) ovarian as compared to tubal involvement, both support a tubal origin of most HGSC. Detailed tubal sampling according to current protocols will alter stage distribution in low-stage disease, through detection of microscopic tubal involvement in apparent stage I cases. Objective: To evaluate the presence of neoangiogenesis and epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) markers expression in Paget disease of the vulva (PDV) and to verify their role in the pathogenesis of the disease and as potential predictors of recurrence.",

Conclusion: While eosinophils were more likely seen in chronic endometritis, they were frequently seen in controls as well. The presence of eosinophils is not a specific marker of chronic endometritis. Objective: There are two etio-pathogenic pathways for the development of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas (VSCC), one associated with infection by human papillomavirus (HPV); and another independent of HPV. We aimed to determine whether there are any differential characteristics between the two types in a large series of tumours. Objective: \"Invasive micropapillary serous carcinoma\" has been proposed as a synonym for low-grade serous carcinoma (LG-SC) . Although it appears that invasive micropapillary areas in some serous carcinomas exhibit high-grade nuclear atypia, the molecular features of such tumours have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to verify appropriateness of using the term \"invasive micropapillary serous carcinoma\" as a synonym for LG-SC. Method: We selected 24 \"serous carcinomas with conspicuous invasive micropapillary pattern (SC-IMPs)\" and investigated: 1) their morphological features, 2) the immunostaining pattern of p53 protein, and 3) KRAS/BRAF/TP53 gene mutations.",

Low-grade SC-IMPs were characterized by low mitotic activity, absence of abnormal mitosis, presence of serous borderline tumour, occasional BRAF mutation, and infrequent TP53 mutation. High-grade SC-IMPs were characterized by high mitotic activity, presence of abnormal mitosis, conventional high-grade serous carcinoma (HG-SC), frequent TP53 mutation and lack of KRAS/BRAF mutation. Conclusion: Using the term \"invasive micropapillary serous carcinoma\" as a synonym for LG-SC is misleading, since HG-SC can show conspicuous invasive micropapillary pattern. Objective: To differentiate molar (complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) and partial hydatidiform mole (PHM)) and non molar pregnancies on the basis of routine histopathological criteria and expression pattern of p57Kip2 by immunohistochemistry. Also, to determine whether any of these features can predict clinical behavior and progression to persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (PGTD). Method: Archival materials of 65 cases of products of conceptions (POCs) were revised histopathologically. The tissue sections were also stained immunohistochemically with antibodies against p57Kip2. Follow-up data concerning progression to PGTD were investigated. Results: Certain histopathological criteria were found significant in differentiation between CHM and PHM. These include villous shape and outline, villous trophoblastic hyperplasia and atypia at extravillous trophoblasts. P57Kip2 immunohistochemistry was statistically significant in diagnosis of CHM and distinguishing it from PHM and non molar cases. There were no significant differences in any morphological or immunohistochemical features between cases with or without subsequently developed of PGTD.",

Although the distinction between CHL and PMBL is usually straightforward, some cases have overlapping features and qualify as mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (GZL). Fascin and CD83 are markers of histiocytic/dendritic cells that are frequently positive in CHL, but their expression in PMBL and GZL is less well known. Method: We retrospectively collected cases of PMBL, CHL and GZL from three institutions. Tissue sections prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were stained with fascin and CD83 using routine immunohistochemical methods. Objective: MDS is a disorder of hematopoietic stem cell, which risks to progress in acute leukemia. It is essential a good prediction of the risk of the evolution towards acute leukemia (according to IPSS-R).

None of the HLH cases (burn or non-burn groups) were diagnosed pre-mortem. Conclusion: Secondary HLH results from overactivation of the diffuse mononuclear phagocyte system due to a strong cytokine/chemokine response to a variety of systemic viral infections such as EBV and CMV. More rarely, other viral, bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial agents have been implicated. To the best of our knowledge, HLH has been reported in a single case of a severely burn patient.

It was first described in 1930 by Jakob Erdheim and William Chester and ever since only several hundred cases has been documented in the literature. The disease is associated with significant morbidity, due to histiocytic infiltration of critical organ systems. Among the more common sites of involvement are the skeleton, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, kidney (retroperitoneum) and skin. Histologically, it is characterized by xanthogranulomatous infiltrates, which are positive for CD68 and negative for S100 and CD1a.",

She was presented with obstructive uropathy and symmetrical sclerosis of long bones. Results: ECD was confirmed clinically, radiologically and histologically. Conclusion: Erdheim-Chester disease is a systemic histiocytosis caused by non-Langerhans cells and typically foamy histiocytes, involving mainly retroperitoneal space and bones. Recent data, has proved that most of these patients harbor point mutations of the BRAF gene at codon 600. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, an oral FDA approved targeted agent to the BRAF protein for melanoma, shows dramatic activity in patients with Erdheim-Chester disease whose tumour contains the same mutation. This therapy has proven highly beneficial in this patient. Diagnosis of this rare syndrome requires a high index of suspicion and increased awareness.",

A Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed and showed a vasculitis image. She was hospitalized for a probable vasculitis of the central nervous system. Concurrently she had anemia with kidney failure at 18 mg/l. Kidney biopsy was therefore executed. Histological analysis revealed, in the light of the glomerular and peritubular capillaries, centroblastic-like large atypical cells. The immunohistochemical study showed that the lymphoid cells expressed CD20, CD79a and did not express CD3. The final diagnosis was intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.",

Clinical symptoms of RILBCL may be those of proteinuria or renal dysfunction. Renal failure may be due to the circulation glomerular obstruction due to the invasion of lymphoma cells. Histopathology allows the diagnosis of RILBCL by highlighting lymphoma cells in the light of the glomerular and peritubular capillaries. RILBCL is an aggressive lymphoma with poor prognosis in general. However an early treatment provides better prognosis. Conclusion: RILBCL is a very rare large B cells lymphoma type with poor prognosis. However, the knowledge of this entity improves the patients'caring. Objective: Head and neck sarcomas are rare tumours with various histological types displaying different clinical behavior. Our objective is to summarize the epidemiology of sarcomas occurring in the head and neck and identify their clinicopathologic characteristics. Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of 50 patients with primary head and neck sarcomas diagnosed in our department from 1996 to 2013. Results: Thirty-eight adult cases and 12 pediatric cases were identified. The mean age was 31 years. Forty-two per cent of the patients were males and 58 % were females. Median duration of follow-up for the entire group was 18.5 months. The most common location was the nasal cavity (50 %). In adults, the most common histologic subtypes were fibrosarcoma (23.6 %), chondrosarcoma (13.5 %), Kaposi sarcoma (14.3 %) and osteosarcoma (14. 3 %). In the pediatric cohort, the most common histologic subtype was rhabdomyosarcoma (83 %). Fifteen per cent of patients had evidence of prior radiation exposure. The size of tumours was greater than 5 cm in 26.3 % of the cases and 35.5 % of tumours were high-grade. Margins were positive in 31.2 % of the cases. Lymph node metastasis were rare representing 6.5 %. Among all subtypes, 5-year overall survival was 66 % for adults and 73 % for pediatric patients. Conclusion: Sarcomas are uncommonly found in the head and neck. In our series, lesions tended to be high-grade with a significant portion of surgical specimens having positive margins.",

Method: A cross-sectional study that involved patients submitted salivary gland biopsies to histopathology departments of four centers in Khartoum State, Sudan. Data were collected from patient's records and the slides were collected and reviewed to confirm the diagnosis. Results: Out of 110 patients aging 2 to 85 years with a mean of 35 \u00b1 15, there were 62 (56.4 %) males. Fifty percent of the tumours originated from the parotid, 35.5 % from the Submandibular and 12.7 % from minor salivary glands. Of them 34 (30.9 %) were malignant and 76 (69.1 %) were benign. Eighty percent of patients with malignant lesions were below the age of 40. Pleomorphic adenoma was the most common benign tumour (86.8 %), followed by oxyphilic adenoma (5.3 %), and myoepithelioma (3.9 %). The malignant tumours were dominated by adenoid cystic carcinoma (26.5 %), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (23.5 %), acinic cell carcinoma (11.8 %), poorly differentiated carcinoma (11.8 %), papillary adenocarcinoma (5.9 %), basal cell carcinoma (5.9 %), squamous cell carcinoma (5.9 %), malignant myoepithelioma (2.9 %), polymorphous low grade carcinoma (2.9 %), and highly malignant large cell lymphoma (2.9 %). Conclusion: The pattern of distribution of salivary gland tumours in Sudanese patients share many pathological and epidemiological features with other developing countries. The results of our study demonstrate that FS in combination with clinical examination have an important role in the determination of the extent of thyroidectomy for patients with a thyroid nodule and FS is recommended for patients with noduler thyroid disease limited to one lobe of the thyroid gland and atypia/ follicular lesion of undetermined significance. There were 2 false positive FS results, and only one false negative results. The underdiagnosis was mainly due to the small size of the tumour. The 2 patients had false positive results included one patient with benign papillary hyperplasia as the final diagnosis and one patient with follicular adenoma. As a result, no patients underwent unnecessary total thyroidectomy. Objective: Snail and Twist are two key transcriptional regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whose expression has been studied in a few salivary gland tumours. The aim of this study was to investigate Snail and Twist expression in salivary adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (ANOS). Method: Nine cases of salivary ANOS were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Snail and Twist. The association between Snail or Twist expression and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed statistically using Fisher's exact test.",

Four cases (44.4 %) occurred in the parotid gland and five cases (55.6 %) involved the minor salivary glands. Five cases (55.6 %) showed regional or distant metastasis, and two cases (22.2 %) showed recurrence. Snail was positive in about half of the cases (4/9, 44.4 %), whereas Twist expression was observed in most cases (8/9, 88.9 %). Snail expression was significantly associated with regional and distant metastasis (P = 0.048). Twist expression showed no correlation with clinicopathological parameters. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Snail and Twist are involved in EMT of salivary ANOS. Snail may play an important role in metastasis of salivary ANOS. Conclusion: Non-KC is a rare neoplasm with distinct morphological characteristics. Its diagnosis is primarily based on the site of lesions and the histological features. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis could be aided by immunohistochemical staining. The tumour may originate from the epithelium of nasal cavity and sinus, and was not closely related with EB virus and HPV infection; the treatment is primarily surgical excision combined with postoperative radiotherapy. Objective: Laryngeal amyloidosis (LA) is a rare lesion (first reported 1873) representing 0,5-1 % of all benign laryngeal diseases. Although usually primary and localized it can also be a part of systemic disease or secondary to an underlying malignancy. The precise etiology and pathogenesis of LA remain unknown. There is no definite established link with smoking,alcohol or vocal abuse. Method: A 67 years old heavy smoker woman was presented with a 6 months history of hoarseness and recent onset of a choking sensation. Laryngoscopy revealed an 1,8 cm lobulate ventricle and left vocal cord mass suggesting a laryngeal malignancy. An incisional biopsy consisting of 0,5 \u00d7 0,5 \u00d7 0,3 cm tissue was performed.",

Method: We identified 13 non-ectopic pituitary endocrine tumours presenting as masses of the nasal cavity, sinuses, or nasopharynx, which were biopsied from these sites. Results: The series included 5 men and 8 women, aged 29 to 69 years. Presentations included nasal obstruction (4), headaches (3), visual defects (3), epistaxis (1), rhinorrhea (1), sepsis (1), and fatigue (1). All tumours originated from the sella and extended inferiorly to involve the sphenoid sinus (10), ethmoid air cells (8), nasal cavity (6), and nasopharynx (3). In three cases the initial diagnosis was incorrect; two were classified as olfactory neuroblastoma, one of those was converted to neuroendocrine carcinoma, and one tumour was initially diagnosed as neuroendocrine carcinoma. In two cases, the wrong diagnosis led to incorrect treatment. Follow-up was available for 10 patients and ranged from 2 to 25 years. Four patients were free of disease and 6 were alive with disease. Conclusion: Pituitary endocrine tumours can invade sinonasal cavities and/or nasopharynx and when they do, they present a possible diagnostic pitfall with potentially serious consequences. Pituitary endocrine tumours should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a neuroendocrine nasopharyngeal or sinonasal tumour. In remainder no thyroid malignancies were diagnosed at 6 month follow-up. \"Bethesda\" categories show the following LRs, (95%CI): \"Malignant\" 91.4 (12.8-650); 79-98 % cancer probability \"Suspicious for malignancy\" 9.9 (9.9 (3-33); 29-86 % probability. \"Suspicious for follicular neoplasm\" 0.51 (0.3-0.97), 26-27 % probability. \"Atypia of unknown significance\" 0.56 (0.4-0.9); 2-26 % probability. \"Benign\" 0.06 (0.02-0.2); 1-4 % probability, and \"Unsatisfactory\" 0.24 (0.06-1.1); 1-13 % cancer probability . Conclusion: LRs greater than 10 and Less than 0.1 are helpful in ruling in and ruling out of thyroid malignancies; LRs 0.1 to less than 1, and greater tham 1 to 10 are less accurate and of limited diagnostic accuracy. Due to uncertainly of several \"Bethesda\" categories highlighted by the LRs, the surgeries continue to be performed for patients with a substantial number of benign lesions.",

Palatal tumours may extend into the upper respiratory tract and skull while distant metastases via lymphatic and haematogenous routes though uncommon, is to the lungs, liver, brain and bones. Metastatic disease at diagnosis is observed in less than 5 % of the cases.

Method: A 25 years old female patient was admitted to our Ear, Nose and Throat out-patient clinic with the complaint of nasal obstruction for 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 23 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 19 mm sized polypoid mass on the roof of the nasopharynx and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in bilateral neck region. Thyroid gland was normal and an endoscopic punch biopsy was performed. Results: Histologically, the tumour consisted of papillary growth of cuboidal or columnar epithelium. The papilla were complex and tightly packed with hyalinized fibrovascular cores. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for TTF-1, negative for thyroglobulin, CK19, CD56, P63, Napsin A. The pathological diagnosis was consistent with TL-LGNPPA. Conclusion: TL-LGNPPA is a rare low-grade neoplasm with distinct morphological characteristics. The differential diagnoses included papillary thyroid carcinoma, low-grade papillary adenocarcinoma of salivary gland origin, and a papillary variant of intestinal -type adenocarcinoma. TL-LGNPPA have an excellent prognosis with simple and complete resection. Objective: Squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity is in the ten most common cancer worldwide. Oral epithelial dysplasia may be described as morphological appearances between normal and malignant epithelial tissue. Here, we evaluated the mRNA expression of caspase-4 and immunohistochemical detection of apoptotic and proliferating cells via DDF-45, and Ki67 antibodies, on oral squamous cell carcinoma, dysplasia, and non-neoplastic epithelial hyperplasia cases intending to emphasize the apoptosis in oral cancer and in the disease's so called early stages. Method: Ten formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were used for each entity. Caspase 4 expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. ABC method was used for immunohistochemistry.",

Proliferation index also was higher in cancer cases than dysplasia and hyperplasia. Conclusion: DFF45 seems to play an important role in the onset of apoptotic process by acting through the regulation of DNA fragmentation. These data suggest that the apoptosis through caspase 3 expression and DNA fragmentation is active in oral epithelial neoplasms especially in squamous cell carcinoma. Method: Twenty cases of PA, 20 of RPA and four TRPA cases were immunohistochemistry studied for ER and PR. A grading system based on nuclear reactivity percentage was assigned on a scale from 0 to 3. Less than 10 % cell reactivity was assigned 0; 11-25 % was assigned 1; 26-50 % was assigned 2; and reactivity greater than 50 % was assigned 3. CT imaging and FNB revealed metastatic disease in lymph nodes of the mediastinum, however no primary tumour was found in our patient.",

We have investigated such scenarios in Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) in an attempt to identify those that are relevant for this particular lesion. Method: We analyzed 31 cases of PLGA using immunohistochemistry for anti-CD34 and anti-CD105 to detect blood vessels; anti-D2-40 to detect lymphatic vessels; anti-Bax, anti-Bcl-2 and anti-Survivin to explore cell apoptosis; anti-Beclin and anti-LCB3 to investigate autophagy and anti-p21 and anti-p16 for senescence. Results: Immunohistochemical results showed that PLGA containing numerous CD34-positive blood vessels, very low number of CD105 positive cells and scarce lymphatic vessels. Bcl2 was strongly and uniformly expressed whereas Bax expression was weaker and heterogeneous often within the same lesion. Survivin, Beclin and LC3B were strongly expressed in PLGA cells. Regarding senescence, the results showed that PLGA cells do not express p21 and only a small proportion of lesions show positivity to p16. Conclusion: PLGA progression does not depend on newly formed vessels, it is otherwise promoted by autophagy, sustained by both antiapoptotic and anti-senescence signals and stimulated by Bcl-2 and Survivin.

Objective: Endolymphatic sac tumour (ELST) is a rare neoplasm with benign histopathological appearance and clinically destructive behavior which occurs in the skull base and frequently invades the petrous bone, the mastoid, semicircular canal, cerebellopontine angle structures and cranial nerve. The term \"aggressive papillary middle ear tumour\" has been proposed to describe this invasive type of middle ear tumour. These tumours can be encountered sporadically or in Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Method: Here we report a sporadic case of ELST in 54-year-old woman. There wasn't any symptoms or history of VHL disease in the patient. She presented with a chief complaints of vertigo and hearing loss approximately 15 year duration. CT imaging demonstrated a destructive lesion of the right petrous bone. MR scanning revealed a 6 \u00d7 7.5 mm mass which showed peripheral hyperintensity and central hypointensity on T1-and T2-weighted images. Microscopically the tumour was composed of typical papillary structures lined by a single layer of cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells The stroma of the papillary fronds was richly vascularized. The epithelial cells had uniform nuclei and pale eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically the tumour cells showed positive reactivity with pan-CK, CK7, EMA, vimentin, and focal reactivity with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and p53. Objective: Higher PD-L1 expression in tumour cells predicts better response rate in NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Small biopsies are predominant specimen type available for predictive testing. We analyzed PD-L1 expression in various biopsy size specimens of NSCLC tumours. Method: The study included resection specimens (N = 63), tissue microarrays prepared from resected tumours (n = 50), and small biopsies obtained during diagnostic procedures (N = 64). FFPE sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry using PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone SP142, Roche, USA) on an automated staining platform (Benchmark ultra, Roche, USA). PD-L1 expression was evaluated on tumour cells with membranous staining. PD-L1 positivity was defined by two cutoff values, 1 and 5 %.",

It is defined as an adenocarcinoma in which the enteric component exceeds 50 % and have to show the expression at least of one immunohistochemical marker of enteric differentiation. Although its definition is very important, above all in the differential diagnosis between a primary lung tumour and a metastasis of colorectal adenocarcinoma, this cancer still lacks a distinctive immunohistochemical and molecular signature. Method: We recruited a large series of LAEDs and we evaluated the immunohistochemical and molecular profiles of these adenocarcinomas. Results: In our series, CDX-2 and CK7 were the immunohistochemical markers mostly expressed by PAEDs. There was an inverse relationship between the expression of pnuemocytes-markers, such as TTF-1, and intestinal markers.

Method: We investigated EGFR, HER2, BRAF mutations and ALK rearrangement in 1400 cases of cytology, biopsy and surgically resected specimens. The rate of these genetic mutations or rearrangement was determined for each organ. Results: We observed mutated EGFR in 14.97 % of pleural metastasis (31 out of 207), in 4.96 % (8 out of 161) of lymph node metastasis, in 11.36 % of bone metastasis (10 out of 88), in 5.40 % (4 out of 74) of brain metastasis and in 24 % of liver metastasis (6 out of 25). ALK rearrangement was found in pleura (3.86 %), brain (2.70 %) and lymph node (0.62 %) metastasis. Lymph node and liver metastasis showed HER2 mutations in 0.62 % and 4 % respectively.

Our aim was to investigate the role of mesenchymal stem cells-and conditioned medium treatment in remodeling of PF. Results: The sclerosing pneumocytoma is benign lung tumour derived from primitive respiratory epithelium. This is a rare tumour usually asymptomatic, occurring in 80 % of cases among middle-aged women. Chest X-ray shows a solitary and well circumscribed mass. Histologically, the SP is characterized by solid, papillary, sclerotic, and haemorrhagic regions. The tumour consists a dual population of surface cells resembling type II pneumocytes and round cells, with slightly different histogenetic profiles. Regional lymph node metastases are rare. Conclusion: Sclerosing hemangiomas of the lung are generally considered benign lesions, and surgical excision is curative without the need for additional treatment. Results: We report a 19 year-old female who consulted for general checkup. X-ray and CT scan images found incidentally diffuse sandstorm images in both lungs. Lung biopsy was done and morphological examination showed numerous round intra-alveolar calcifications consistent with Pulmonary Alveolar Microlithiasis.

None but one case had bronchial glands within the cystic area of lesion. Results: The highest incidence of malignancy occured in the first (100 %) and third (65 %) decades and the most common malignancy during the first four decades of life was malignant lymphoma (42 %). The most common presenting symptoms were dry cough (40 %), chest pain(42 %), dyspnea (39), weight loss (22 %) and pleural effusion (10 %). Twelve percent of patients were completely asymptomatic. The majority of tumours and cysts were located in the anterior mediastinum (51 %). 65 (46 %) patients had hilar masses or masses in the middle mediastinum. A minority of lesions (4 %) were in the posterior mediastinum. The highest rate of malignancy was observed in anterior mediastinum (55 % malignancy rate). The most frequent diagnosis were mediastinal sarcoidosis (25 %), malignant lymphoma (10 %), tuberculosis (10 %) and tymoma (7 %). Objective: To report a case of a thymolipoma associated to a thymic cyst, an association that, to our knowledge, was previously reported only once in the literature. To describe briefly the pathologic aspects of these two benign uncommon entities.",

Histologically, the solid part was made of two components: nonproliferative thymic tissue and abundant lobules of mature regular adipocytes. As for the cystic cavity, it was made of a fibrous wall comprising residual thymic parenchyma, lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. The diagnosis of a thymolipoma associated with thymic cyst was retained. Conclusion: Thymolipomas and thymic cysts are rare tumours of the anterior mediastinum, they can be responsible for non-specific clinical manifestations, only pathological examination confirms the diagnosis. The combination of these two entities is an exceptional occurrence.

Computed tomography scan reveals a homogenously enhancing soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum. Gross examination; the tumours were not capsulated but well circumscribed, and measured 60 \u00d7 30 mm. Results: Microscopic exmination; The tumours were composed of anastomosing islands or broad trabeculae of epithelial cells disposed among delicate spindle cells. The normal thymic tissue was observed at the periphery of lesion. The epithelial cells were oval to polygonal with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and small prominent nucleoli. Groove and pseudoincluson seen in epithelial cells. The spindle cells showed a short fascicular or storiform growth pattern, and were bipolar processes.

A detailed diet questionnaire was taken from acne patients and controls. Serum level of IGF-1 was measured using ELISA technique, skin biopsies were taken from lesion on the back of acne patients and normal skin of the back of healthy volunteers, and FoxO1 and m-TOR expression was detected using immunohistochemistry. Results: A significantly higher serum IGF-1 level was found in acne patients compared to controls. The cytoplasmic expression of FoxO1 was found significantly more in the acne group while in the control subjects this expression was likely to be nuclear. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of mTOR was significantly higher in intensity in acne patients compared to controls. Excess consumption of high glycaemic load diet was significantly associated with higher serum level of IGF-1 and cytoplasmic expression of FoxO1 and mTOR. Conclusion: These results suggest that FoxO1, m-TOR, serum IGF-1and high glycaemic load diet may have a role in acne pathogenesis. Objective: An autosomal dominant form of diffuse non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma, palmoplantar keratoderma of Bothnian type, is caused by mutations in the AQP5 gene encoding the cell-membrane water channel protein aquaporin 5 leading to defective epidermal-waterbarrier function in the epidermis of the palms and soles. Method: Genomic DNA purified from a blood sample from the proband was analyzed using bidirectional Sanger sequencing of the AQP5 gene. Results: We report the first Danish family diagnosed with diffuse nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma in which 14 individuals are potentially affected. The proband, a 36-year-old male had since childhood been affected by pronounced hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles along with palmoplantar keratoderma. He reported a very distinctive feature of the disorder, as he developed pronounced maceration of the skin with translucent white papules and a spongy appearance following exposure to water. The patient presented recurrent fungal infections, a wellknown feature of the condition, but also periodic worsening with pitted keratolysis and malodour due to bacterial infections. Objective: Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is the most common benign dermal neoplasms in elderly individuals.

Results: Microscopically the lesion was well defined, composed of bland and pigmented basaloid and squamous cells, with formation of pseudohorn cysts. Admixed with the epidermal keratinocytes there were neoplastic cells, isolated or forming small nests, with large nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm (focally PAS+, PAS/D+). These cells were immunopositive for CK7, GCDFP-15, CK8, CEA, EMA and HER2 1+ and focally 2+. S100, Mart1, HMB45, CK20, ER, PR were negative. The patient underwent thorough examination to exclude the possibility of an underlying internal malignancy, with negative results. A diagnosis of EMPD within a SK was established. Conclusion: Cutaneous neoplasms with two or more distinct cell populations frequently pose a diagnostic challenge to both clinicians and pathologists. Although malignant transformation has been reported in SK, Paget's disease in a pigment SK is very rare and may be overlooked.

We aim through these cases to describe the clinical presentation, epidemiological and histopathological features of this entity and insist on its poor prognosis. Method: We describe two cases of MM with skin involvement diagnosed in pathology departments of Sfax and Gabes Hospitals. Results: We report the cases of two men aged respectively of 56 and 31 years; both presented with multiple violaceous nodules of the trunk. The youngest patient was known carrying a MM in incomplete remission since 1 year, whereas a MM was diagnosed in the first case. Histopathologically, both skin lesions revealed a dense dermal infiltrate of plasmablasts strongly immunopositive for CD138. No karyotype abnormalities were evidenced in the initial karyotype of the second patient while complex abnormalities including 17p deletion were found in the first case. The latter received poly-chemotherapy reaching a partial remission with no recurrences detected within 6 month follow-up while the youngest patient died 1 month after extramedullary-relapse.

Method: 58 years old non \"Caucasian\" woman who presented a Merkel cell carcinoma of the posterior face of the right elbow. She had a dark skin. She presented first with a stage II disease and had a biopsy excision and was lost of follow up for 4 months. She presented with recurrent disease on the inferior third of the right arm with three metastatic ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathyconfirmed after biopsy. The treatment decision was to perform an amputation of the right arm and ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection with adjuvant radiotherapy. She stayed controlled for 6 months after the end of radiotherapy and then presented with lung metastasis and died from respiratory failure.

Conclusion: ALHE is heterogeneous condition and share features with cutaneous IgG4-related disease. Further characterization of the disease process is needed to confirm this observation. Method: Histological slides and pathological reports from 137 primary gastrectomies and corresponding lymphadenectomies performed at a Brazilian university hospital were reviewed. Whole-tissue sections from each primary tumour and from paired lymph node metastases in 85 cases were submitted to immunohistochemistry. HER2 status was confronted with clinicopathological parameters to assess statistically significant associations. Results: HER2 overexpression was found in 17/137 primary tumours (12.4 %) and 12/85 metastatic lymph nodes (14.1 %) . There were associations between intestinal-type tumours and tumour differentiation and HER2 expression in primary tumour (P = 0.026 and P = 0.005) and metastatic samples (P = 0.008 and P < 0.001). The concordance rate was of 88.2 % (\u03ba-value: 0.515). There were 10 discordant cases, from which five cases (5.9 %) were HER2 positive in the primary cancer and negative in nodal metastases, while five cases (5.9 %) were negative in the resection specimen and positive in metastatic deposits. Conclusion: Since eligible patients for anti-HER2 treatment may remain undetected if immunohistochemistry is performed only in primary tumour samples, HER2 testing in lymph node metastases is encouraged.",

Histologically, all cases showed sheet-like or solid nest-like growth of amphophilic ovoid atypical cells, which accompanied with acinar pattern. Immunostaining showed the positivity for both the neuroendocrine markers such as CD56, chromogranin-A, and synaptophysin and the acinar cell markers such as lipase and alpha-amylase. Only case 2 was positive for BCL10. Ultrastructurally, the cancer cells included 200 nm electron-dense neurosecretory granules and 500 nm electron-lucent zymogen granules. Some cancer cells were double positive for chromogranin-A and alpha-amylase. Conclusion: MAEC of the stomach is extremely rare. This tumour is positive for both neuroendocrine markers and acinar cell markers. Gastric MAEC is limited to the immunopositivity for BCL10, whereas lipase is a useful marker for acinar differentiation. Objective: Standard care for locally advanced, rectal cancers (LARC) consists of chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by surgery. The response rate to CRT has important prognostic impact.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of digestive leiomyomatosis with such a diffuse small bowel, colonic and rectal presentation without peritoneal location. The peculiarity of our observation is the worsening of symptoms after pregnancies, attributed to hormonal stimulation of the intestinal muscle expressing strongly estrogen and progesterone receptors. Results: Thirty nine out of 73 (53.4 %) patient were identified to have raised intraepithelial lymphocytes, ten patient were 18 years or below and 29 patients were above 18 years. In our study, we considered the upper limit of normal intra epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) as 25 IELs/100 enterocytes. We applied the criteria for modified MARSH grading system to our patients and we found that most of our cases were classified as normal (33 patients), followed by followed by grade 1 (30 patients) and grade 3 (9 patients) (P < 0.0001). 11 patients with modified MARSH grade 1 (36.67 %) were positive for one or more of antibodies, which are antitransglutaminase antibody, antigliadin antibody and antiendomysial antibody. Conclusion: In conclusion, the grading system will help and guide for further evaluations for the suspected cases and to start the management early. The finding of a raised IEL count with normal villous architecture is clinically significant and must be highlighted in routine duodenal biopsy reports. Results: EGFR expression of distal EBD carcinomas was 26.2 %, 6.0 % and 6.0 % in the weakly positive, moderately positive, and strongly positive groups, respectively. HER2 expression was 5.9 %, 3.6 %, 1.2 % in the weakly positive, moderately positive, and strongly positive groups, respectively. All cases of strongly positive EGFR expression showed amplification (n = 1) or high polysomy (n = 4) of the EGFR gene and 3 cases (60 %) of moderately positive EGFR expression also showed high polysomy. One case of strongly positive and 2 cases of moderately positive HER2 expression showed amplification of the HER2 gene. EGFR expression was associated with shorter cancer-specific overall survival (p = .005). Conclusion: Although further study is warranted, our finding suggests anticancer therapeutics against EGFR and HER2 receptors may be an effective therapeutic options for some subsets of distal EBD carcinoma patients. Objective: CD24 is known to be a putative marker of stem cell and tumour metastasis. The study aims to verify the clinicopathologic values of CD24 expression in adenoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC).",

Cytoplasmic CD24 expression increased from adenoma to well to moderate differentiated CRC and was decreased in poorly differentiated CRC (p < 0.001). In the CRCs, cytoplasmic expression of CD24 was inversely correlated with high-grade differentiation (Grade 1 to 3), tumour size and pathologic TNM stage (I-III versus 4) (p = 0.005, p = 0.03, p = 0.006). The statistical associations between CD24 expression and overall and disease-free survival rates were not seen. Conclusion: Cytoplasmic CD24 plays important roles in carcinogenesis, and the differential pattern of CD24 expression between well to moderate differentiation (G1 and 2) and poorly differentiation (G3) in CRC implies overexpression of cytoplasmic CD24 is an early process, through adenoma to invasive carcinoma. Objective: Traditional serrated adenoma (TSA) is a serrated polyp that has a predilection for the left colon. The aim of the study is to describe a mucin-rich variant of TSAs (MrTSA). Method: One hundred and forty-one TSA were retrieved in the departments of Pathology (UHN and Oxford). Age, sex, site, presence of conventional dysplasia, association with other polyp types, frequency of ectopic crypt foci (ECF) and content of goblet cells were recorded and compared to classic TSA (cTSA). Arbitrarily, TSAs that consisted of more than 50 % goblet cells were classified as mucin-rich TSAs (MrTSAs). The number of ECFs was quantified as low (1-10) and high (>10). All the TSA included in this study showed the typical serrated pattern. Results: Of the 141 TSAs, 22 fulfilled the criteria for mrTSA. There was a slightly higher male predominance of mrTSA but no age difference compared to cTSAs. While both occurred most commonly in the left colon, mrTSAs were relatively more frequent in the right (28.6 %) than in the left colon (12.6 %) (p = 0.012). Ten of 22 mrTSAs were associated with other polyp types: 8 sessile serrated adenomas (SSA) and hyperplastic polyps (HP) (3 TSA/HP, 2 TSA/SSA and 3TSA/SSA/HP) and 2 with tubular adenomas. mrTSAs showed a lower frequency of ECF than cTSAs (p = 0.001).

Acellular mucin pools in 8 non-mucinous cases were considered as total regression (Dworak 4). Craniocaudal extension <3cms, yT, cN0, yN0, cM0, yM0, total/subtotal regression (Dworak 3/4) were significantly associated with longer CSS and DFS (P < 0,05). Mucin pools had not prognostic significance in cases with complete pathological response. Craniocaudal extension and yN were significant independent variables. Regression grade was an independent prognostic factor for DFS. Conclusion: Pathological tumour regression by Dworak score has prognostic significance in rectal cancer treated by CRT.

Ploidy data showed increase in aneuploidy in HGD and OAC with average DNA index scores of 1.45 and 1.32 respectively. Conclusion: E2F is most upregulated marker with strong contribution from HGD and OAC compared to SQ. Ki67 showed upregulation in the earlier NDBE all the way to HGD and OAC. However p53 only showed upregulation in OAC. Ploidy analysis showed aneuploidy increase in HGD and OAC. Taken together, this suggests that cell cycle regulation plays crucial role in the progression to OAC. Objective: Barrett's oesophagus (BO) occurs as a consequence of inflammatory response triggered through prolonged reflux and may precede the development of adenocarcinoma (OAC).

Objective: Inflammation supports the different phases of cancer development, being one of the main factors of risk and prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Granzyme A (gzmA) induces an pro-inflammatory response in macrophages and epithelial cells, regulating the production of cytokines in vivo and in vitro. We have now analyzed the contribution of gzmA to the development of CRC of inflammatory origin using different drugs. In parallel the presence of gzmA in colic tissue from patients with CRC has been analysed. Method: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and CRC was induced in C57Bl/6 wild type (wt), granzyme A KO (gzmA-/-) and granzyme B KO (gzmB-/-) mice using 2,5 % DSS in drinking water alone (UC) or in combination with a single dose of Azoxymethane. Disease evolution was monitored during 2 months. Mice were evaluated after 60 days. The production of inflammatory mediators was quantified in cultures of colic tissue ex vivo. Results were evaluated using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's posttest and considered statistically significant if P < 0,05.",

Objective: Epithelial serration, ectopic crypt foci (ECF), and cytoplasmic eosinophilia are typical features of traditional serrated adenomas (TSA); though they may be observed in conventional tubulovillous adenomas (TVA). When there is accompanying adenomatous dysplasia, the differential diagnosis becomes more difficult. The term\"serrated TVA\" (STVA) has recently been introduced to define TVA with serration. We, hereby, present a series of TSAs with filliform architecture and adenomatous dysplasia resembling TVAs. Method: Eleven filliform TSAs showing epithelial serration, ECF and cytoplasmic eosinophilia in more than 50 % of the polyp were analysed, using an immunohistochemical panel including CK7, CK20, MUC2, MUC 5AC, MUC6, CDX2, Beta-catenin, p16, p53, and Ki67. Results: Nine polyps were located in the rectosigmoid while 2 were in the proximal colon. Three cases had intramucosal carcinoma, one had high and the remaining showed low grade dysplasia (7/11). Dysplastic areas showed diffuse positivity with Ki67 and p53, and Beta-catenin. Gastric foveolar differentiation was observed focally in all with MUC5AC expression whereas, 5 polyps showed focal CK7 positivity and 3 demonstrated MUC6 positivity. All polyps were diffusely positive with MUC2, CK20 and CDX2. Objective: Cancer development is influenced by the host's immune system. Data collected from large cohorts demonstrates that the immuneclassification has a prognostic value that may be superior to the TNMclassification. Evaluation with Immunoscore (I) methodology could be a useful prognostic marker in patients with colorectal cancers. Method: Intratumoural immune reaction was investigated in 20 colorectal tumours from a total of 166 diagnosed in 2011 at Emergency County Hospital Timisoara.

Computed tomography scans showed severe ileal wall thickening with segmental strictures, suggestive of CD. Diagnostic biopsies revealed SCC and therefore the patient underwent distal enterectomy and sigmoidectomy. Results: Grossly, there were serosal adhesions, ileal mucosa ulceration with cobblestone pattern and wall thickening, with segmental stenosis along the specimen. Histologically, ileal SCC was confirmed, involving contiguous intestinal loops and sigmoid wall; transmural inflammation, myoenteric hyperplasia and fibrosis in non-infiltrated areas were also evident. The case was signed off as a SCC associated with CD. Conclusion: Despite being an uncommon complication of CD, small bowel carcinoma should be kept in mind when dealing with enterectomy specimens. The pre-operative diagnostic challenge raises awareness about the absence of surveillance methods for malignancy in the small intestine, namely in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Objective: Intramural lymph node (ILN) spread of digestive carcinomas is an extremely rare event (in the literature there is a single report of an oesophageal carcinoma with metastasis to a gastric ILN). Herein we report a case of gastric carcinoma with ILN metastasis in the submucosa of the stomach and discuss the implications for staging. Method: A 55-year-old man was referred to our Hospital after the detection, on gastric endoscopy, of an ulcerated lesion (1 cm in diameter) diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. The patient was submitted to radical subtotal gastrectomy. Results: The histological examination revealed a mixed gastric carcinoma, with tubular and poorly-cohesive cell components and focal invasion of the muscularis propria (pT2). Two submucosal ILNs were identified, localized away from the tumour, both with metastases of the tubular component. No other metastases were found in the remaining lymph nodes identified in the specimen. The tumour was staged as pT2N1, and the patient was started on chemotherapy (XELOX regimen). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of ILN metastasis from a gastric carcinoma, in keeping with the rarity of this situation. For staging purposes, ILNs should be considered as regional lymph nodes and staged as pN1 (x/total lymph node count).",

Conclusion: Intraobserver and interobserver agreement is moderate for LGD diagnosis, and poor for IND, even between GI pathologists. When at least 2 pathologists agree with LGD diagnosis, the risk of progression is high, so ablation in such cases seems justified. anal melanomas harbor KIT mutations. In human somatic cells, telomeres shorten with each replicative cycle, eventually leading to cellular senescence. Telomerase activity is detected in approximately 90 % of malignancies, allowing tumour cells to bypass senescence and achieve unlimited proliferative potential. Recently, mutations in the TERT promoter region at positions 124 and 146 bp upstream of the ATG start site have been described in tumours from multiple organ systems, including sporadic and familial cutaneous melanomas. These mutations carry a UVsignature and portend a poor prognosis in cutaneous melanoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hotspot mutations in the TERT promoter region in a cohort of anal melanomas. Method: 15 cases of anal melanoma were collected from the United States, Canada, and Germany with approval from respective Institutional Review Boards.

Objective: Endoglin (CD105) is an pro-angiogenic factor involved in inflammation, as well as in tumoural neoangiogenesis. In ulcerative colitis (UC) its actions are correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). There are some anti-VEGF molecules targeted against this pathway, but further studies are nedeed for better understanding their role in UC pathogenesis. Method: We studied expression of CD105 and VEGF on colonic biopsies from patients with UC at the beginning of the study and 12 months later. The study group included 45 UC patients, who underwent complete clinical and endoscopical evaluation each 12 months. Results: All patients had incresead stromal expressoion of CD105 and VEGF in colonic mucosa lamina propria, with significant corelation of the two markers (t-test two-tailed p = 0.0139). During treatment, expression of these markers decreased concordantly (t-test two-tailed p = 0.0085). Patients with severe incresed of stromal CD105 had a higher risk of relapse and unfavorable evolution. Conclusion: CD105 and VEGF have concordant evolution in colonic mucosa of UC patients, and coorelate with their outcome. These data suggest that they are not only angiogenic factors, but also proinflammatory molecules ands promising therapeutical targets.

Conclusion: CCa staging could be challenging, mainly due to the decision of serosal involvement. In this study, we underlined the difficulty of deciding peritoneal invasion, even with the eyes of an experienced pathologist. CK7 was found as a useful parameter in this study, consistent with the literature. We did not consider the EVG as a helpful stain in this study, in contrast to the previous literature. Objective: In colorectal carcer, tumour budding (TB) at the invasive front (peritumoural budding -PTB) is associated with poor outcome in multiple studies but clinical relevance of tumour budding within the tumour center (intratumoural budding-ITB) is not yet known. Also there is not an established cut off for high TB. We aimed to compare ITB and PTB in colorectal carcinoma with prognostic parameters. Method: We retrieved HE stained sections from 70 colorectal carcinoma cases. Tumour grade, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, Crohn like inflammatory infiltrate, and vascular invasion were recorded. The maximum number of tumour buds was determined at the advancing edge of the tumour in a x20 objective and within the tumour center. Cases with >10 and equal to 10 buds were classified as high budding and those with 0 to 9 buds were classified as low budding. Low and high ITB and PTB are compared also for liver metastasis, T and N stage.",

Conclusion: In conclusion, these preliminary results suggest that both intratumoural and peritumoural budding are associated with poor prognostic factors such as liver metastasis and vascular invasion. We suggest a histologic cut off >10 and equal to 10 for high tumour budding. Investigation of larger series of cases are needed to support our findings. ",

Mesothelial cell origin of CAF has been proved in peritoneal metastases but its contribution to primary neoplasms is less known. Method: We have evaluated 14 surgical specimens corresponding to infiltrative large bowel adenocarcinoma (pT3 and pT4). The immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin AE1/AE3, calretinin, HBME-1, CK7, CK20, WT1, D2-40, CDX2 and alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) was evaluated in CAF. Mesothelial to mesenchymal transition is defined \"in vivo\" by the expression of mesothelial cell markers in cells that show fibroblastic location, morphology and expression of alpha SMA (myofibroblasts). Results: The immunohistochemical study revealed that a subpopulation of intestinal CAF expressed mesothelial cell markers. Such fibroblasts were seen within the tumour as well as in the vicinity of the peritoneal surface. In addition to alpha-SMA they showed variable expression of cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CK7, calretinin, WT1 and other mesothelial markers. CAF showed no expression of CK20 or CDX2.

Indication of endoscopy was gastric pain (10 cases), chronic diarrhea (4 cases), anemia (2) cases, and vomiting (3 cases). Discovery of gastric granulomatosis was fortuitous in 5 cases. Upper endoscopy was normal in 6 cases, showed antral gastropathy (11 cases). Granuloma was unique in 7 cases and multiple in 17 cases. 6 patients (25 %) had Crohn's disease while 5 had gastric tuberculosis (21 %). In two cases, H Pylori was the retained cause of gastric granulomatosis. In the other patients, the final diagnosis was a foreign body reaction (n = 1), sarcoidosis (n = 2), yersiniosis (n = 1).

Clinical and neuroimaging correlation, and appropriate immunohistochemistry are useful in distinguishing glioblastoma with ependymoma-like foci from anaplastic ependymoma. Results: 10/51 (19.6 %) glioblastomas showed intense granular cytoplasmic ALK immunostaining. All 10 were primary (IDH1R132H-) and only 1/10 displayed multiple alk gene signals with FISH, indicative of gene amplification/polyploidy. ALK overexpression was not detected in secondary (IDH1R132H+) glioblastomas (n = 5). The Ventana method showed higher sensitivity (p = 0.000) but was equally specific compared to the Nichirei. Intense ALK immunostaining was correlated with high proliferation index (Ki67 \u2265 50 %) (p = 0,043). There were no statistically significant correlations between ALK overexpression and clinicopathological variables, p53 expression, and patient overall survival. Conclusion: In glioblastoma, ALK overexpression is infrequent and is rarely the result of underlying alk gene amplification/polyploidy. Although its presence is more frequent in rapidly-growing glioblastomas indicating a more aggressive clinical behavior, ALK overexpression does not appear to affect patients' prognosis.",

Conclusion: Ante-mortem diagnosis is challenging as it is rarely suspected unless histopathologically proven or there are concurrent skin lesions that help suspect neurocutaneous melanocytosis. Given the rapidity of the course of disease once neurologic symptoms set in, diagnosis is usually confirmed only after autopsy. No treatment strategy has been proven to be effective in controlling this disease but clinical trials are currently underway for a viable cure based on the molecular profile of the tumour, emphasizing the need for molecular diagnostics.

Results: The greater part of the resected tumour consisted of a dense, patternless proliferation of large, round, or polygonal cells and the compactly fascicular growth of spindle cells. Tumour cells showed markedly anaplastic cytological features. In small areas of the tumour, a typical meningothelial meningioma showing no cellular atypism was found.

Conclusion: The autopsy, histology and immunohistochemistry revealed a primary extraventricular neurocytoma of the midbrain, which was responsible for causing cardiopulmonary arrest and sudden death, through pressure on the pons and cerebellum.

The most significant is the increase in VEGF and TP gene expression levels, which, along with the growth of Ki-67, shows an increase in the malignancy process. Conclusion: It's difficult to prove the role of the different treatment options in this transformation. Gilbert's Syndrome may be a concomitant disease or it may play a role in the described phenomenon because of the increase of unconjugated bilirubin which interacts with the phospholipids of cell membranes, particularly in the brain. Objective: Angiomatous meningioma (AM) is a rare histological variant (2.1 % of meningiomas) in which it is described an increased peritumoural brain edema. We analyze the clinicopathological features and the mast cells index, reviewing their neuroimaging studies and possible correlation. Method: From 692 meningiomas altogether, 2,02 % (14) were diagnosed as AM (median: 60 years old). Most of them were located in the frontal lobe and were surgically treated. Results: Histology of the tumours revealed numerous variable sized blood vessels, hyalinized, in a background of plump spindle cells with oval vesicular nuclei. Vimentin, EMA and GFAP showed positivity, so AM were diagnosed. Using CD117 stain, we observed 0,3 %-3 % of mast cells index depending on the case studied. Peritumoural edema was significative increase on computed tomography. However, we couldn't correlate it with the mast cells index. The majority of the patients had a good prognosis. Conclusion: Radiologically, angiomatous meningiomas have more frequent peritumoural edema. Histologically, they are rich in blood vessels. Surgery is the treatment of choice, adding radiotherapy if tumour remains. Overall, its prognosis is as good as other benign meningiomas. We need more studies to understand the role of the mast cells in the development of the edema and its importance in the diagnosis. Objective: To describe a rare embryonal tumour in a fetus.

Integrin \u03b24 transfected U87MG revealed decreased invasiveness and increased proliferation. Integrin \u03b24 knocked out U373MG showed increased invasiveness and decreased proliferation. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that expression of integrin \u03b24 is related to decreased invasiveness and increased proliferation in glioblastoma. Results: Tau-related pathology was seen at all motor levels. The intensity of spinal cord involvement correlated with tau pathology in other areas of the pyramidal system. Six of the cases were found to involve the entire motor system. Conclusion: The pyramidal system and spinal cord were involved in the majority of PSP cases investigated. This involvement can influence PSP clinical symptomatology and potentially lead to a false diagnosis of motor neuron disease or at least significantly influence the differential diagnosis. Objective: Embryonal neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS) generally arise in the early years of life and behave in a clinically aggressive manner, but vary somewhat in their microscopic appearance. Several groups have reported examples of an embryonal tumour with combined histological features of ependymoblastoma and neuroblastoma, a lesion referred to as \"embryonal tumour with abundant neuropil and true rosettes\" (ETANTR). Method: We describe the case of a 7-year-old girl with recurrent acute headache for about 6 months ago, bilateral papilledema and intracranial hypertension. MRI of the brain demonstrated an expansive mass located in both frontal lobes midline.",

The distintive feature of the ETANTR was the presence of ependymoblastic rosettes. It was treated according to SIOP -PNET protocol 5: chemotherapeutics, radiation therapy and bone marrow transplant. Conclusion: ETANTR is a unique entity, a subtype of CNS PNET, with female predominance and quite different from that the other CNS embryonal tumours. The prognosis is extremely poor. Method: We analized the distribution of iron and calcium deposit in basal ganglia, substantia nigra and dentate nucleus of six brain donors of the brain bank, Navarre, Spain. We also correlated the deposition with the stage of the disease. Results: From the cases studied, two were in each of Vonsatell category (initial, intermediate and advanced). Iron deposition was observed in all cases, being more prominent in caudate and putamen nucleus compared with globus pallidum and substantia nigra. The density was higher in intermediate and almost negative in advanced stages. The iron deposition was observed in macrophages, astrocites and neurons. Calcium cristaloids were also observed in endotelial walls. Results: Sixteen undiagnosed brain tumours were macroscopically detected and microscopically diagnosed as meningiomas of various types. They were grade I, measuring 15 to 50 mm. Two were in the same person. As for cause/manner of death, 1 tumour contributed to the fatal event (SUDEP).

Immunohistochemistry for IDH1 R132H and ATRX, and FISH for 1p/19q codeletion was performed in all cases. Results: IDH1 R132H mutation was found in 61,5 % of cases (16/26). OA grade II cases were reclassified into 5 O grade II, 5 DA, 6 grade II gliomas NOS, 2 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) and one OA grade II. Anaplastic OA were reclassified into 4 glioblastomas, 2 AA and one anaplastic oligodendroglioma. In 6/26 cases the new diagnosis implied a higher tumour grade, even a change from low to high grade. Conclusion: There is a need to retrospectively review cases of OA in order to offer patients an accurate treatment. However, even if the majority of OA will be reclassified following the new diagnostic criteria, there is a small subset of true morphologically and molecular mixed tumours. Objective: Heparanase (HPSE) cleaves heparan sulfate and is implicated in diverse physiological and pathological processes. A central pathological event of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accumulation and deposition of cytotoxic amyloid-beta peptide (AB) in the brain parenchyma. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are found associated with AB deposits in the brains of AD patients. Method: 7 different areas of 4 brains (1 control, 1 low AD, 1 moderate AD, and 1 severe AD) were obtained. Transcriptional levels of HPSE using RT-PCR and the expression of the protein using immunohistochemistry were centered on Braak & Braak areas and nucleus basalis of Meyner and cerebellum. Results: HPSE is expressed in all studied areas of the control and AD brains. AD brains overexpress HPSE except in nucleus basalis of Meyner. HPSE expression is better related with AB deposits rather than tau deposits. Cerebellum, an apparently non-altered structure in AD showed HPSE overexpression in all pathological cases. Immunohistochemically HPSE is observed at extracellular level in neuritic plaques with a fragmented core. In cells, HPSE highlights some neurofibrillary tangles and reactive astrocytes. Conclusion: Our study has revealed increased expression of HPSE in the brains of AD patients in both extracellular and intracellular levels. Objective: Diffuse infiltrating gliomas (DIG) are currently classified after the criteria defined in the World Health Organization Classification applied on Hematoxylin-Eosin and Imunnohistochemistry cytological features also correlated with prognosis. DIG are subdivided in large categories of astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and mixed oligoastrocytomas demanding different therapeutic procedures.

Results: All these 30 cases had co-deletion of 1p/19q positive, confirming oligodendroglial differentiation in ologodendrogliomas, oligoastrocytomas and glioblastomas with oligodendroglial features. Conclusion: Due to DIG histopathological heterogeneity, difficult cases may be validated by 1p/19q codeletion to fill one class or define molecular heterogeneity observed in WHO tumour grading and validate prognosis and treatment. As molecular biomarkers will diminish the difficulty of classifying oligodendroglial lineage of tumours, the implementation of this molecular marker in the framework of routine scheme is essential to improve patient treatment, prognosis and clinical decision, avoiding immunohistochemistry in differential diagnosis of other brain tumours, reducing Pathology practice cost.",

Tumour expressed Melan-A and S100 and was negative for CD117, CD99, GFAP, Synaptophysin, AE1/AE3 and 34\u03b2/E12. Ki67 labeled <1 % of nuclei. Conclusion: Based on histopathologic features, differential diagnosis included melanocytoma, melanoma, melanotic schwannoma and meningioma. Unlike our case, melanoma cells are more pleomorphic and has higher mitotic rate. Melanotic schwannoma was excluded by molecular profile (GFAP-, Melan-A+). Tumour also was negative for pancytokeratin markers, which excludes meningioma. Tumour was classified as benign melanocytoma. No adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy was performed. After 16 month of follow up, patient has no recurrence and return to normal life with minimal neurologic complication (slightly decreased field of vision). Results: The median age of the patients was 40 years. The tumours were mainly located in the frontal lobe and 73,7 % presented with seizures. Eight patients underwent complete resection but only seven had no radiological evidence of residual tumour in the follow up. One patient died after the surgery. From the 9 oligodendrogliomas all had ATRX loss of expression, 7 showed mutated IDH1 and 1 overexpressed p53. The 6 diffuse astrocytomas showed ATRX loss of expression, 1 had IDH1 mutated and 5 overexpressed p53. From the 4 oligoastrocytomas 2 had ATRX loss of expression, 2 showed mutated IDH1 and 2 overexpressed p53 being therefore classified as diffuse astrocytomas. Conclusion: We were unable to test for IDH2 mutations or 1p/19q codeletion but IDH1 mutation accounts for 90 % of IDH mutations and ATRX loss of expression and p53 overexpression are almost mutually exclusive with 1p/19q co-deletion. Unfortunately we couldn't correlate the outcome with the expression of any these markers due to the short follow up. Results: Five patients, 1 female and 4 male ranging from 27 to 76 years (median = 45,4 years). Lesions were predominantly located in more than one lobe.

Method: We examine small biopsy tissue at frozen section and subsequent resection specimen. Results: Islands of atypical squamous cells with focal \"less atypical\" squamous epithelium and inconspicuous mitotic activity are seen at frozen section. Over 90 % of the tissue by area shows islands of atypical squamous cells in focal desmoplastic or fibrotic stroma. Rare small foci of benign-looking epidermal lining with associated sebaceous glands and hair in transition to squamous dysplasia and invasive carcinoma are identified after histologic examination of the whole specimen.

Results: The patient was a previously healthy, middle-aged woman who presented to the clinic with new-onset typical angina. One tumefactive lesion encasing the left anterior descending artery was found during her work-up. The most common underlying malignancies with secondary cardiac involvement were rationally ruled out. Symptoms persisted despite medical treatment and she was therefore referred to surgery. Tumour excision was successfully performed and she received coronary bypass grafting. IgG4-related coronary arteritis with pseudotumour formation was subsequently diagnosed following the comprehensive diagnostic criteria. This condition was clinically classified as active and circulating plasmablasts were found to be increased (5480/mL), even when these were determined 38 days after surgery. A PET/CT revealed an additional hypermetabolic lymph node. She was therefore treated with rituximab as induction therapy (two 1000 mg doses, administered 15 days apart). Three months later, her disease remained clinically inactive. Circulating plasmablasts were repeated and these had dropped to 0/mL.

In the ischemic group transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal filament technique, obstruction of the left MCA for 90 min, followed by gently removing the filaments. Subjects were sacrificed after 24 h to assess morphological and molecular changes. The distribution of neuronal damage was evaluated with Nissl stain. Immunohistochemistry was performed using leukocytes markers (MPO, Neutrophil elastase, CD68, CD3,CD4, CD8), their released cytokines (MMP 9 and MMP 8) and FXIII (involved in macrophages activation).

Liver biopsy, promptly performed, is a safe and accurate tool to achieve the correct diagnosis and guide patient management. Objective: Salivary gland anlage tumour (SGAT) is a rare benign tumour, with only a few cases being reported in literature. This tumour is composed of mixed epithelial and mesenchymal elements and it recapitulates the early stages in the embryology of the salivary gland between the 4th and 8th weeks of development. To report a rare case of salivary gland anlage tumour (SGAT), review the histological features, immunohistochemical studies and review the literature. Method: Medical records, radiologic studies, and pathologic report were reviewed. Results: The patient is a 15 day old neonate who presented with nasopharyngeal mass and respiratory distress at birth. CT scan of head was performed which suggested a vascular tumour. MRI revealed a non vascular mass in the nasopharynx. Operative findings showed a huge mass attached to the posterior part of the septum and obstructing both choanae and extending into the right nasal cavity. The mass was removed and histopathology with immunohistochemical studies confirmed a diagnosis of salivary gland anlage tumour. Conclusion: Salivary gland anlage tumour of the nasopharynx is a rare cause of neonatal airway obstruction. Recognition of SGAT is important because simple excision of the lesion achieves cure. Objective: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease with an incidence of 1/30.000, rarely symptomatic in children, that should be excluded in acute or chronic liver disease, of unknown etiology. Histopathology of WD is not specific, especially in early stages, making the differential diagnosis a challenge.

Comparison between the histological subtypes was calculated by the independent sample t-test (p \u2264 0, 05). Results: The average Ki67 proliferation index in whole medulloblastoma group was 36,81 %, in classic medulloblastoma group (n = 15) 37,43 % in nodular/desmoplastic tumour group-(n = 3) 23,98 %; SD, in anaplastic tumours-(n = 2) 51,4 %. The average of p53 positive cells in whole medulloblastoma group was 11,74 %, in classic medulloblastoma group 12,34 %, in nodular/desmoplastic tumour group 11,80 %; in anaplastic tumours 7,10 %. The diferences of both Ki67 and p53expression between classic and nodular/desmoplastic tumour groups were not statistically significant (p = 23; p = 0,94). The differences between both markers expression in anaplastic and nodular/desmoplastic tumour and anaplastic and classical tumours were not statistically significant, respectively p = 0,12; p = 0,32; p = 0,60; p = 0,61. Conclusion: As the differences of Ki67 and p53 protein expression of different subtypes of medulloblastoma was not statistically significant, it should not be taken in consideration during the assessment of histological subtypes. Results: Among 1004 perinatal autopsy cases 90 (9 %) cases had congenital urinary system malformations. In this group 35 cases (38.9 %) were female and 55 cases (61.1 %) were male. Among these cases with congenital urinary sytem malformation 60 cases (65.9 %) had at least one associated anomaly. Most common associated anomaly was dismorphic findings (47.8 %). And it is followed by skeletal dysplasias and lung malformations with a percentage of 27.8 %. And neural tube defects are also common associated anomaly (10 %). Conclusion: Congenital urinary malformations are classified as renal abnormalities of renal mass, abnormalities of renal position-form, congenital anomalies of upper urinary tract, abnormal renal differentiation. Renal cystic disease is an important group of congenital urinary system malformations which is included in abnormal renal differentiation. Diagnosis of renal pathology should be given clearly because some may be hereditary or associated with other anomalies and be a component of a syndrome.

RI Sutton (1938) believed that this lesion is de facto a cancerous entity and not a pre-neoplasia. This according with Lever (1949) and others; he found that in certain age periods, not all histologic elements develop evenly, that there is a certain predominance in the development of that one, the other entities, the explanation of which lies in the alternation of stages of differentiation and growth stages of histological elements, thus it was established phenomenon diskhroniya development intraorgan structures; his work has shown that humanity in its structure is fragmented, concluded: \"The considerations made on basis of experimental data lead us to an extremely important and highly interesting conclusion.

Method: The textbooks of museum of pathologies' chair of Belgorod State National Research university. Results: In the end of XIX century and in the beginning of XX century textbooks, issued in other countries, were often used in medical institutes in spite of teaching, conducted on Russian language. Books on pathological anatomy, issued on German language were on the first place. Thus, the textbook \"Pathologische Anatomia\"(1913) by Ludwig Fschaff was recommended in St.Petersburg and in Moscow. In 30s the significant number of books of scientists of Russian school of pathology was published. The book of Nikiforov and Abrikosov \"The basis of pathological anatomy\" (1928) should be noted. The monopolization of separate schools for issuing of students' manuals and the publishing of uniform textbook on pathological anatomy occurred in USSR in period of 70s-90s of XX century. Nowadays in Russian Federation teaching of pathology and pathological anatomy is carried out in dependence from specialty with extended number of textbooks. The qualitative atlases are issued. Such textbooks as \"Anderson's Pathology\" are used for teaching. Objective: Digital Pathology (DP) introduces changes in the traditional work of pathologists. An important issue is the image handling from an ergonomic point of view to avoid work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). The aim of this study was to investigate a proper input device (ID) for DP. Method: Research included two phases: 1. Eight medical students analyzed 11 IDs (figure 1), with the ImageViewer software and the web-based Fitts'-law-test to objectify accuracy. A questionnaire with ergonomic topics was included. 2. Evaluation by two experienced pathologists the best rated ID and comparison with a voice recognition system (VRS), using a headset microphone and rating perceived workload using NASA Task-Load-Index with 28 digitized preparations. Digital-Image-Hub with a 4-MegaPixel-display were used. Results: Correlation between technical aspects of the evaluated devices and accuracy (Fitts'-law-test), and comfort with overall satisfaction existed (p < 0.05). The assessment concluded that vertical mouse was the best rated ID. However, it has a slightly higher perceived workload in comparison with VRS, which was the proper controller for DP in this study.",

Twenty-six (61.9 %) respondents found it fairly easy to make a make a diagnosis, 13 (31 %) thought it was easy, while three (7.1 %) noted that it was difficult. Twenty-four (57.1 %) respondents had a fairly smooth user experience, 12 (28.6 %) experienced occasional crashes while six (14. 3 %) reported a smooth experience. Almost all (97.6 %) of the respondents felt the pathology teaching was beneficial to their local pathology practice and all indicated the need for more of such sessions. Conclusion: The beneficial applications of internet based lectures make it a viable cheaper, faster and cost effective alternative to face-to-face lectures in delivering education to resource-limited countries. Objective: Turn-around time (TAT) in pathology is a key performance indicator, but TAT methodology is rarely a focus in the literature. TAT follows non-normally distributed (right skewed) pattern, requiring transformation or use of a semi-parametric approach;. mean TAT cannot not be used in such settings. The aim of this study is to apply survival analysis (time to event analysis) to TAT monitoring. Method: We extracted TAT data (2010-2014) for all breast core biopsies processed in our department (n = 4,118), time of accessioning and time of sign-out for each case. There were no censored cases. We built a histogram and ran Kaplan-Meier analysis, using 1-minus-survival (time to task completion) plot, and stratified the data by the calendar year and complexity. Log-rank test was used to compare the differences in TAT between calendar years and complexity codes. Results: The model fits proportional hazard assumption. The TAT displays non-normal right-skewed distribution. The Kaplan-Meier curves show notable similarity over the years, with a small yet statistically significant difference in TAT over the years (log rank test, p < 0.0001, from median 4.3 (95%CI 4.1-4.6) days in 2010 to 3.8 (95%CI 3.4-4.2) days in 2014) and are dependent on case complexity. Conclusion: Kaplan-Meier (time to event) analysis is a robust method of monitoring TAT in anatomical pathology. It is more informative than point estimates of mean and median TAT. Furthermore, it is potentially applicable to monitoring of individual pathologist turn-around time and allows for multivariate adjustment to case complexity, daily workload, and use of ancillary methods.",

To analyze the disagreements we divided them in two groups: MAYOR Disagreement-potentially wrong histological diagnosis changes the clinical tactics of patient's treatment. Potentially wrong pathological diagnosis leads to wrong course of patient's treatment and wrong chemotherapy, etc. MINOR Disagreement-potentially wrong diagnosis doesn't have any clinical matter. This tactic showed that the case of hyalinized endometrioid adenocarcinoma turned out to be the most difficult one for the participants. The range of MAYOR Disagreement here is 66 %, while the full match is 14 %. Conclusion: Rare cases show very low reproducibility index.

They can be selected by Streptamers\u00ae, subsequently analysed and get infused into tumours of patients. Method: We used surgically removed fragments of breast cancer to obtain TAFs, which were further cultivated and expanded in vitro in standard culture conditions. Blood samples were obtained from the same patient, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained by density gradient centrifugation and stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. On the surface of TAFs, we identified by flow-cytometry the presence of a specific antigen-fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and we custom-made MHC I-Strep HLA-A*0201 FAP for isolation of CTLs.",

Conclusion: Co-culture of cytotoxic T lymphocytes was performed in a ratio of 1:1 with TAFs. TAFs proliferation in vitro was abolished after 3 days of co-culture with FAP-specific CTLs, compared with non-specific T cells, which induced only decrease in TAFs proliferation after 5 days of co-culture.

In addition, the expression levels of the inhibitory smad7 which inhibits TGF-\u03b2 activation were raised following vanadium treatment in both cell lines.

Patients with inconclusive tumour origin after histopathological revision (cases) and with certain tumour origin of \u22653 tumours (controls) were analyzed by targeted NGS. Based on identical or different mutations and/or LOH patterns, tumours were classified as 'multiple primaries' or 'one entity'. Results: Histopathology yielded conclusive results for 38/42 (90 %) patients. Four cases and 10 controls were analyzed by NGS. In 44 tumour samples, 48 mutations were found; 39 (81 %) concerned TP53 mutations. In all 4 cases, the intra-patient clonal relationships between tumour localizations could be unequivocally identified by molecular analysis. In all controls, molecular outcomes matched histopathological results. Conclusion: In most BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with multiple tumours routine histopathology is sufficient to determine tumour origins and relatedness. In case of inconclusive results, molecular analyses can reliably determine clonal relationships between tumours, enabling optimal patient treatment. Method: Using next generation sequencing (NGS), seven inverted papilloma (ISP)-associated SNSCC and their synchronous associated ISP, six non-SNSCC-associated ISP, ten non-ISP-associated SNSCC and four sinonasal adenocarcinomas were analyzed. Results: Activating EGFR mutations were detected in 75 % of SNSCCassociated ISP (and corresponding SNSCC) and in 83 % of non-SNSCCassociated ISP. All detected mutations took place in exon 20. We also found in one non-SNSCC-associated ISP a mutation in ERBB2 exon 20, analogous to the EGFR exon 20 mutations. Conversely in none of non-ISP-associated SNSCC and sinonasal adenocarcinoma an EGFR mutation was found. TP53 mutations were detected in 50 % of SNSCCassociated ISP and 80 % of their associated SNSCC but in none of non-SNSCC-associated ISP, indicating that TP53 mutations occur later than EGFR/ERBB2 mutations in ISP-tumourigenesis. Furthermore, mutations of MET, NFE2L2 and PIK3CA were described in ISP-associated SNSCC, mutations of MET, KRAS, PIK3CA and TP53 in sinonasal adenocarcinoma, mutations of TP53, NFE2L2, KRAS, PTEN and PIK3CA in non-ISP-associated SNSCC. Conclusion: EGFR/ERBB2 exon 20 driver-mutations are defining a specific molecular tumour entity for SNSCC arising from ISP.

This novel pleiotropic effect of simvastatin on circulating monocytes may prevent the excessive accumulation of monocytes on the arterial wall during the process of atherosclerosis. Objective: Hypertension causes endothelial dysfunction by impairing vascular relaxation eventually develops pressure on the heart. Endothelial disruption leads to inhibition of the release of vasodilators (nitric oxide) causes alteration in vascular cell functions. Cholinergic/ noradrenergic receptors along with voltage-operated channels are involved in control in vascular targets. Method: In the present investigation hypotensive effect of Aegiceras corniculatum, methanol and ethyl acetate extracts and their mechanism of actions were experimentally evaluated in in vivo and in vitro using normotensive rats and rabbit aortic rings. Results: Methanol extract has shown tremendous effect at 10 mg/kg i.v. in reducing mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) 79.2 \u00b1 1.8 mmHg as compared to control group of 128.2 \u00b1 0.8 mmHg in rats, which was significantly suppressed (33 %) in the presence of atropine. Furthermore, methanol extract failed to produce vasodilation in endothelium denuded rabbit aorta and in the presence of L-NAME a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor in phenyleprine contracted tissue. Whereas, ethyl acetate extract exhibited inhibition (35-67 %) in % fall in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in the presence of nifidipine (0.3-0.9 mg/kg, i.v.). Antihypertensive effect of extracts were further supported by anti-platelet aggregation and eNOS activation. Conclusion: Methanol and ethyl acetate extracts possess significant hypotensive and vasodilatory activity via muscarinic receptor dependent release of endothelium derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide and calcium channel blocking potential, thus the study validates traditional use of A. corniculatum against cardiovascular disorders.",

For new targets such as Program cell Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) this need is becoming crucial, especially given the breadth of potential variables, including the range of companion diagnostic assays. There is a growing need to have defined, consistent and sustainable reference materials to support reproducibility and methodology transfer. Method: Using CRISPR gene editing technology, we have developed precisely defined PD-L1 IHC HDx\u2122 Reference Standards. Results: PD-L1 IHC HDx\u2122 Reference Standards have a range of controlled protein expression to understand the differences in assay performance, establish the practical lower limit of detection, support laboratories with tools to routinely monitor and standardize workflows, from instrumentation to assay to antibody. Cell lines are extensively characterised by molecular and protein assays. In addition, we use quantitative digital pathology to further define positive and negative core.

Molecular studies confirmed the same BRAF V600E mutation in both malignancies (Hairy cell leukemia and melanoma). Results: Thereafter the patient was started on BRAF inhibitor treatment and is now symptom-free after 1 year of follow up. Conclusion: Having two concurrent malignancies with a shared BRAF mutation is extremely rare and makes this an excellent example of a genomic marker-driven treatment in two histologically and immunophenotypically distinct tumours.

            "text": "Results: Lacrimal gland morphology in diabetic rats was altered, acinar and ductal structures presented different degrees of histological changes, glandular epithelial height decreased and lipofuscin deposits were frequently observed. HEL was expressed in lacrimal gland of diabetic rats, more frequently in a periductal and vascular endothelium distribution. Conclusion: Histological changes and the expression of oxidative markers in lacrimal gland of diabetic rat strongly suggest a correlation between diabetes mellitus, oxidative stress and glandular functional decline; it also provide evidence of a tear film disfunction. Objective: The IgG4-related disease is a specific inflammatory disorder characterized by the presence of elevated serum IgG4, inflammatory infiltrates rich of IgG4-positive plasma cells and fibrosis. Only single cases of uvea and retina involvement in IgG4-related disease were reported. We report a rare case of IgG4-related disease with involvement of the eyes, salivary glands, sphenoid sinus and lymph nodes. Method: 57 years old female presented with a history of right submandibular gland enlargement. Later exudative retinal detachment of the right eye was diagnosed together with the left submandibular gland enlargement and a lesion within the right sphenoidal sinus. Both glands and a lesion were excised and histology showed lymphoid hyperplasia. Results: 6 months later decrement in visual acuity of the left eye was diagnosed. Ophtalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography showed proliferation of the pigment epithelium and fibrosis. PETscan showed enlarged right axillary and right pulmonary lymph nodes. Systemic nature of the disease rise the suspicion of IgG4related disease. Conclusion: Histology of the previously excised lesions was reviewed and IHC was performed. Salivary gland lesions showed brisk lymphoid and plasma cell infiltration, storyform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. IHC showed many IgG4-positive cells. Also serum IgG4 was elevated up to 454 \u03bcg/ml. Systemic corticoids was prescribed. Objective: The major characteristic of Glaucoma is the elevated intraocular pressure at a level high enough to provoke tissue damage causing optic neuropathy, with a highly specific excavation of the optic disc that leads to a progressive loss of visual field. The loss of sight in absolute glaucoma is also caused by the degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells.",

Data was collected from the hospital records. Paraffin embedded blocks and slides of cases were reviewed. Results: The patients' ages ranged from 3 months to 10 years, with a peak at 4 years of age. The mean age of 3.4 years (\u00b11.68SD). Half of the cases presented with a mass, followed by leukoria (40.7 %) and proptosis (9.3 %). All our cases underwent removal of eye; 5 of whom had fungating mass with extra-ocular extension that necessitate exentration. All the cases had one or more poor prognostic histologic feature(s) (necrosis, extra-ocular extension, calcification, optic nerve involvement and involvement of the sclera, choroid and ciliary body). Conclusion: The commonest age of presentation of Retinoblastoma is 1-9 years with a peak at 4 years. All our cases underwent removal of the eye and all have poor histopathologic prognostic features. Our results are in conformity with the African literature, but is different from American and European findings. Objective: Primary orbital lymphoma is a rare disease and accounts between 8 and 15 % of extranodal presentations. It's the most common malignant orbital tumour in adult (10 %). We aim to describe the epidemiological and clinicopathological caracteristics of this entity. Method: We report a case of a 31-year-old women who presented exophthalmia since 3 months. Results: Brain MRI showed a left 5 cm orbital tumour, including the muscles rectus superior, the lateral rectus muscle and the lacrimal gland. The biopsy revealed fibro fatty tissue with diffuse tumour infiltration of small lymphocytic cell, to scant cytoplasm and round hyperchromatic nucleus. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity of tumour cells for CD20, CD23 and CD5. The diagnosis was lymphoma B-small cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell type (LLC). The patient had 4 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy with good response and consolidation radiotherapy. The evolution was marked by recurrent proptosis 9 years later. A biopsy with pathologic examination confirmed the lymphoma infiltration type LLC. FCR chemotherapy was prescribed.",

Multivariate analysis did not show any significant relationship between density of CD68 or CD163-positive cells and survival. Conclusion: High-levels of CD163-positive macrophages correlated negatively with stage of Ewing sarcoma. CD163 proved to represent a sensitive marker of macrophages, but based on our results not specific for M2 phenotype, detection of which needs multiple staining using more markers. Objective: Sarcomas represent a biologically very heterogeneous group of tumours. Methylation array-based profiling has been successfully employed by us to device a classification tool for primary brain tumours. Based on this experience, we expanded our analyses to a set of 600 genetically well-characterized sarcomas. Method: Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified the CpG probes most highly correlated with distinct sarcoma types. Based a on random forest algorithm, we developed a sarcoma classifier. Genome-wide copy number profiles generated from the raw array data provided additional diagnostic information.",

Objective: Aneurysmal cyst of soft tissue(ACST) is a very rare benign soft tissue tumour that is histologically identical to aneurysmal bone cyst, but that shows no association with the skeleton. It arises in the deep soft tissues of the extremities of adults. Male and female individuals are affected equally. Method: A 18-year-old women was admitted with a painless mass of left lateral thigh. Plain radiograhs demonstrated a peripheral calcified mass within muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed 5.5 \u00d7 3.5 cm wellcircumscribed mass with blood-filled cystic spaces. Results: Histopathological examination showed multilocular cystic lesion. Blood or serous fluid-filled cystic spaces were divided by nonendothelial lined septae composed of a mixture of mononuclear spindle cells and osteoclast-like giant cells. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages were present. Mitosis and necrosis were not seen. A shell of well-formed bone was also seen at the periphery of the tumour. The spindle cells were positive for smooth muscle actin, vimentin and CD68. Multinucleated giant cells and macrophages were also positive for CD68. Conclusion: If the surgical excision is incomplete, then local recurrence may develop, but aggressive local growth or metastases do not occur. The differential diagnosis of ACST should include giant cell tumour of soft tissue (GCTST), myositis ossificans(MO) and soft tissue osteosarcoma (STO).",

Objective: Mesenchymal tumours, in general, and schwannomas, in particular, are extremely rare among primary gastric neoplasm. We presented here three cases of gastric schwannoma with analysis of histological and immunohistochemical features. Method: Review of hematoxylin-eosin slides of all gastric \"mesenchymal tumours\" from pathology files (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . Immunohistochemical studies for S100, \u03b1-SMA, KIT (CD117), desmin, vimentin and CD34. Results: All patients were women (67-, 54-and 56-year-old) presented with mild abdominal pain duration of 3 and 6 months. Tumour size is as follows 4.0 \u00d7 4.5, 2.0 \u00d7 2.5 and 6.0 \u00d7 7.5 cm. One patient died of colon cancer 4 years later, second and third are free of disease 8 and 7 years. Histologically, spindle cells proliferation of moderate cellularity with diffuse chronic inflammation and peripheral lymphoid cuff typified each tumour. Nuclear palisading was barely visible. Mild cellular atypia, mitotic rate 7/50 HPFs were identified in the one case, mitotic rate of other tumours-5/50 HPFs. Immunohistochemically, in every case tumours represented \"schwannoma\" phenotype-expressed S100 and vimentin with negativity for CD34, KIT, SMA, and desmin. Objective: Synovial sarcoma (SS) commonly arises in the paraarticular regions. It usually located around knee and ankle joint, hip, shoulder and elbow. But SS has been described in various other locations. In such cases the correct diagnosis is often difficult. We report a case of primary SS revealed in the spermatic cord, since we found only a few descriptions of this tumour in an inguinal area. Method: A 54-year-old man was presented with a slow growing slightly painful focal thickening of the left spermatic cord for the past 4 months. This lesion clinically was diagnosed as a cyst and surgically excised. It measured up to 3 cm in diameter. Cut surface was yellow-white with focal hemorrhages and firm. Histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed. Results: Microscopically the tumour was biphasic and resembled SS. It had spindle cells arranged in fascicles and plump epithelial cells forming poorly differentiated glandular structures, cords and solid sheets. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that tumour cells were positive for panCK (particularly in the epithelial component), bcl-2, CD99 (more in the spindle cell component), CD57, Vimentin, S-100. At the same time, they were negative for CK20, CEA, Mesothelin, SMA, Desmin, AFP, CD45, Inhibin, WT1. Ki-67 was estimated at 60 %. Metastatic process was excluded.",

Myofibroblastic cells exhibited immunoreactivity for actin and vimentin but failed to show either ALK cytoplasmic immunostaining or ALK rearrangements. Conclusion: IMT is an uncommon neoplasm with a peculiar histological pattern and immunohistochemical profile that may or may not show ALK immunoreactivity and rearrangements. In the presence of characteristic histological and immunohistochemical features, the lack of ALK changes does not exclude the diagnosis of IMT in adults. Method: The studied material consisted of bone, muscle, joint and ST samples obtained by biopsy or surgical excision from 99 patients confirmed with TB usually histologically, by Ziehl-Neelsen staining but, sometimes, by immunohistochemistry or PCR techniques. Results: Patients with OATB were usually adults or elderly men, hospitalized mainly in orthopedics and rheumatology clinics whereas patients with STTB were rather women, in adulthood, hospitalized especially in general or thoracic surgery clinics. Granulomatous reaction was in both groups usually of well differentiated type, active, with epithelioid and Langhans cells, classical acidophilic caseous necrosis, centrally located and rarely with perifocal fibrosis. There was, however, a significant contingent of poorly differentiated or disorganized type granulomas in the STTB group. The morphological picture revealed in very rare cases the active and destructive profile of the bacillary aggression. Conclusion: OATB and SSTB are a certitude, even the cases are rare. Therefore, one should pay attention to patients around 50 years aged, with swelling accompanied by local inflammatory symptoms of joints regions or ST structures accesssible to clinical examination.",

A better disease free survival rate has been observed with the current multimodality treatment; however prognosis of patients with unresectable primary tumour, clinically evident metastasis or refractory to treatment remains dismal. In this regard, more beneficial prognostic factors and more effective therapeutic modalities are needed. Proliferation index is suggested as an important prognostic marker for bone tumours. Tumour growth and metastasis have been shown to strongly depend on angiogenesis, however, data regarding the relevance of angiogenesis and prognosis in malignant bone tumours are scarce and controversial. With this background in mind, objectives of present study Objective: Controversies regarding the benefits and complications of the injection of corticosteroids (CE) for the treatment of tendinopathies. Our aim was to evaluate the histological, biomechanical effects, and expression of metalloproteinases and interleukins on Achilles tendons of rabbits treated with CE. Method: The Test Group with 37 rabbits underwent to injection of CE (1.4 mg of betamethasone) in the Achilles tendon of the right pelvic limb. Control Group 36 animals with one injection of saline solution (CP-Placebo Control) and the left Achilles tendon received no procedure (CN-Normal Control) . Forty-eight hours after, the tendons were dissected and extracted at an extension of 4 cm from its insertion in the calcaneus bones.

Method: In the present study, we examined the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, molecular, and follow-up characteristics of 3 cases of superficial Ewing sarcoma-like tumours of the foot. One case was restricted to the dermis, two were located in both the dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Results: All studied tumours composed of cohesive sheets and trabeculae of small blue round cells with a vague rosetting pattern, slightly overlapping nuclei, finely stippled chromatin, and scanty cytoplasm with indistinct cytoplasmic borders. The tumours were strongly and diffusely positive for CD99 with a characteristic membranous staining pattern and negative for muscular and lymphoid markers. Two of three cases contained scarce cytokeratin-positive cells. One tumour showed focal reactivity for EMA and S100 protein. The diagnosis of extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma family tumour was based on histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular cytogenetics (FISH study using EWSR1 break apart probe). Differential diagnoses (carcinoma, melanoma, lymphoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma) were ruled out on the basis of morphology and immunohistochemical staining. The differential diagnosis with EWSR1-related myoepithelial neoplasms were discussed separately. Conclusion: Cutaneous or subcutaneous Ewing sarcoma-like malignant tumours remain exceedingly rare neoplasms and they should taken in consideration in differential diagnosis of superficial located small blue round cel tumours.

We subsequently analyzed the association of both C1S mRNA and protein expression with the clinical and pathological significance. Method: We used real-time RT-PCR to detect C1S transcriptional levels in 20 cases each of urothelial carcinoma of bladder and upper tract. An immunohistochemical stain was conducted to determine C1s protein expression in urothelial carcinoma of upper tract (n = 340) and urinary bladder (n = 295). Furthermore, we examined the correlation of C1s expression with clinicopathological characteristics, disease-specific survival, and metastasis-free survival. Results: C1S transcriptional levels were significantly high in patients with advanced-stage tumours of both groups (all P < 0.05). By immunohistochemistry, C1s overexpression was not only significantly associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters, but also predictive of poor disease-specific and metastasis-free survival rates for both urothelial carcinoma groups (all P < 0.05).

In the nephrectomy specimen, histologic features were similar and complementary immunohistochemistry revealed positivity for CD117 and beta-catenin (cytoplasmic). Electron microscopy showed dense rhomboid cytoplasmic crystals, allowing the diagnosis of juxtaglomerular cell tumour of kidney. Conclusion: Although the literature refers that juxtaglomerular cell tumour is a CD34-positive and Bcl-2-negative neoplasm, we report a case that was both CD34 and Bcl-2-positive. This is the first case reported in the literature with this immunohistochemical profile, which constitutes a considerable diagnostic pitfall, mainly with solitary fibrous tumour. Objective: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a type of tumour, especially of the urinary bladder, that affects people worldwide. Clarification of its detailed tumour biology and discovery of potential targets for developing treatment strategies are imperative because of frequent recurrences and poor prognosis of advanced UCs. By data mining a published dataset of UC of bladder (UCB) transcriptome (GSE31684) from Gene Expression Omnibus, we identified that THBS2 was the most significantly upregulated gene among those related to structural molecule activity (GO:0005198). Method: THBS2 immunostaining was performed in 340 UCs of upper urinary tract (UC-UUTs) and 295 UCBs; subsequently, both groups were dichotomized into high-and low-expression subgroups. Moreover, statistical analyses were performed to correlate the association between THBS2 expression and clinicopathological parameters with two survival indexes: disease-specific survival (DSS) and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). Results: High THBS2 immunoexpression was significantly associated with advanced primary tumour status, nodal metastasis, and vascular invasion in both UC-UUT and UCB groups (all P \u2264 .001). In addition, THBS2 overexpression was linked to adverse DSS and MeFS in univariate analyses and served as an independent prognosticator indicating poor outcomes in both groups in multivariate analyses. Conclusion: THBS2 may play a crucial role in UC progression and may be a novel prognostic marker.

Tumour grades were 1, 2, and 3 in 12 (15 %), 44 (55 %), and 24 (30 %) specimens, respectively. A total of 48 (60 %) patients were positive for overexpression of HER-2/neu. Two cases of HER-2/neu-positive (4.16 %) were grade 1 tumours, 14 (29.16 %) grade 2, and 32 (66.66 %) grade 3.

Conclusion: HER-2/neu overexpression was not correlated with tumour stage, lymph node metastasis or recurrence of the disease. However, a significant relationship between HER-2/neu overexpression and grade of the bladder TCC tumours was found (P = .002).

Method: A 78-year-old man with histological finding of muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma undergoes cystoprostatectomy. Results: Macroscopically, a rudimentary uterus was discovered along the posterior wall of the bladder. Microscopically, in addition to an urothelial carcinoma, endometrial glands embedded in a compact stroma, next to a vas deferens, were noted. Conclusion: Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) produced by fetal Sertoli cells is responsible for regression of M\u00fcllerian ducts. Mutation in AMH gene on chromosome 19p13.3 or abnormality of receptor gene on chromosome 12q13 leads to persistence of the uterus and Fallopian tubes in males. It is transmitted with autosomal recessive or X linked pattern. Patients usually present in childhood with cryptorchidism or with inguinal hernia. These gonads have 15 % risk of germ cell tumours. Treatment of PMDS is surgical and aims to correct cryptorchidism. Careful dissection is required to avoid harming the excretory ducts because frequently the vasa deferentia are embedded in the mesosalpynx, uterine wall and cervix. Removal of the uterus is not recommended. Lack of communication between the testis and excretory ducts and lesions at orchidopexy explain why fertility is rare (11 %). Objective: reveal correlations between vessel malformation and dysnephrogenesis markers in CH. Method: removed kidneys, incision renal biopsies obtained from 63 children from 2 days to 15 years old.

Results: vessel malformation markers were found in all cases: kinking of arteries, defective vessel branching associated with abnormal topography. There were \"budding vessels\"-arteries with disproportionate small branches. The artery wall thickness was variable, bundles of SMC were oriented chaotically. The closer distances between arteries and veins were often present, these veins had sinusoid-like appearance. Vessel malformation was always associated with parenchymal hypoplasia-closely spaced glomeruli with capillary deficiency and dilated extracapillary spaces, glomerular and tubular cysts, undifferentiated tubules lined with cuboid immature epithelium. We found TGF\u03b21 and receptor overexpression in immature tubular epithelium and in cytoplasm of hypoplastic longitudinally oriented SMC of UPJ. VEGF expression were present in glomerular endothelium and in nephrocytes.

Both biopsy GS 7-and 7+ patients had significantly higher PSA levels, mean tumour percentage, percentage of positive cores and \u2265 cT3 than those with GS 6 (all P < .001). GS 7 patients did not have a poorer biochemical-recurrence-free-survival (BCRFS) after radical prostatectomy than GS 6 patients (log rank P = .13), whereas those with GS 7+ had (log rank P = .05). In multivariable analyses, biopsy GS 7-was not associated with poorer BCRFS after radical prostatectomy (P = .47) or radiotherapy (P = .63). GS 7+ was independently associated with poorer BCRFS after radical prostatectomy (P = .03), but not after radiotherapy (P = .67). Conclusion: Men with biopsy GS 7-prostate cancer have similar BCRFS after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy to those with GS 6 and may be candidates for active surveillance.",

Findings were consistent with diagnosis of MTRC. But in contrast to formerly described cases, no melanin pigment could be identified in the current tumour. Conclusion: Herein we report a case of MTRC, showing identical features that were described previously except lack of melanin. This report further expands the morphological spectrum of MTRC by showing that it can be amelanotic. The recognition of this histologic presentation should allow for improved diagnosis of this entity. Objective: Cancer stem cells (CSC) represent a population with tumourinitiating, self-renewal, and differentiation potential. The aim of this study was to evaluate CXCR4 expression as a putative CSC marker in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). Method: The expression of CXCR4 in specimens from RCC patients was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray(TMA). One hundred and seventy-three consecutive patients treated surgically for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) between 2010 and 2015 including 106 (61.3 %) Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), 35(20.2 %) Papillary and 32 (18.5 %) Chromophobe were selected.

The statistically significant association was not found between expression of CXCR4, age and sex and clinicopathologic features of patients including invasion to pelvis, vein, lymph node and tumour size. Conclusion: These findings suggest that CXCR4 can be considered as a valuable tool for the study of renal CSCs and provide a therapeutic target for treatment of the patients with renal cell carcinoma in combination with conventional therapy. Objective: The 2005-Gleason consensus restricted the acceptable morphology for Gleason pattern 3 (GP3) and expanded the spectrum of Gleason pattern 4 (GP4).

Method: We present a retrospective study result, in which 214 cases of bladder urothelial carcinoma stage pT1 gotten by TUR were selected. Three methods were used: 1. Rating focal invasion (a single focus to one mm2) vs extensive invasion (more number of focus or major focus larger than one mm2) 2. Quantification in all areas in mm2 3. Determination of the number of foci of invasion. Results: All methods showed no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of relapse but for the occurrence of progression comparing. Focal vs extensive infiltration (p < 0.001, chi-square test), extent of infiltration in mm2 (p < 0.001 Mann-Whitney U-test) and counting invasive foci (p = 0.0009 Mann-Whitney U-test). Conclusion: 1. Quantification of the subepithelial connective tissue invasion by the urothelial carcinoma is an important prognostic factor regarding the progression. 2.As for the onset of relapse, statistically significant differences were not observed. 3. All methods have been proved to be valid for such quantification. Objective: SmCC of the bladder is a malignant neuroendocrine neoplasm of the urothelium that accounts for approximately the 0,5 % of all the malignant bladder tumours. Clinical features (such as haematuria, dysuria and obstructive symptoms) are similar to those of conventional urothelial carcinoma. Majority of patients are men, age of presentation in the sixth or seventh decade of the life and a story of smoking. The differential diagnosis includes poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma, small cell carcinoma of another site and lymphoma. Method: Our study is based on an observational retrospective study of 7 patients diagnosed, treated and followed for SmCC of the bladder at the University Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain, between 2011 and 2016. Results: All of our patients were men, with an average age of 75,5 years (range 51-94) at the moment of diagnostic. T4 was the most common T stage. The survival average was 2 years after diagnostic. Only two patients are still alive. Conclusion: SmCC of the urinary bladder is an extremely rare malignant neoplasm with neuroendocrine differentiation and an aggresive clinical course. There are no differences in management of SmCC and conventional urothelial carcinoma in our hospital except in metastatic cases.",

On gross examination, a 5 cm tumour was found. Histologically, the tumour was composed of tubules lined by a single layer of epithelial cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and monomorphic nuclei. In most of the tumour stroma, abundant small lymphoid cells were present. This pattern resembled closely Warthin's tumour of the salivary gland. The tumour was limited to the kidney, didn't infiltrate renal sinus, great vessels or renal capsule, and was completely removed. On immunohistochemistry, tumour cells were CK7+, AMACR+, PAX2+, CD56-, WT-, CA9-. Conclusion: To best of our knowledge, this is the first report of tumour with this peculiar morphology and immunophenotype similar to papillary or tubulocystic carcinoma. Objective: Benign prostatic polyps are rare and unusual lesions of the lower urinary tract. They are more commonly observed in the prostatic urethra and less commonly in the urinary bladder, with only a few cases reported in the ureteric orifice.

Results: 232 papillary adenomas were found in 76 patients (19 %), ranging from 1 to 35 tumours/patient (mean 3, median 2). Patients with papillary adenomas were older (range 27-90 years) (p < 0.0001), more commonly smokers (p = 0.01) and associated with glomerulosclerosis (p = 0.0001) than those without. Papillary adenomas ranged in size from 0.5 to 5 mm (mean 1.4, median 1) and were morphologically classified in four subtypes. Adenomas consisting of papillae and/or tubules covered by cells with scant cytoplasm, often with psammoma bodies were the most common (149 tumours), 16 were composed of large eosinophilic cells with pseudostratified nuclei, occasionally near to the apical membrane, in 30 the papillae were broad with lymphocytes in the core, and 30 were more cystic lined by columnar cells and containing macrophages and psamomma bodies. Four were unclassified. Mixtures of types within the same tumour were rare (3 in 1 patient). Conclusion: The first type corresponds well to papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 1 and the second to type 2; the others do not correspond to known carcinomas. Objective: To elucidate the morphology and clinical correlations of renomedullary interstitial cell tumours (RMICTs). Method: Kidneys from 402 unselected autopsies were sectioned at 1 to 2 mm intervals and all lesions were examined histologically. Results: 421 RMICTs were found in 150 patients, ranging from 1 to 23 tumours/patient (mean 3). There was no significant difference in age, gender, hypertension, heart weight, smoking, diabetes, or renal function between patients with RMICTs and without. Fifty-two percent of patients with RMICTs were older than 60 years (range 18-92). Forty-one percent had bilateral tumours and they were older than patients with unilateral tumours (p = 0.0007). The tumours ranged in size from 0.5 to 6 mm (mean 1.7). Renal tubules throughout the tumour was found in younger patients and smaller tumours while the absence of entrapped tubules or their location at the periphery was common in older patients and larger tumours (p = 0.02 and p < 0.0001). Amyloid-like material was common in older patients (p < 0.0001) and in larger tumours (p < 0.0001) and correlated with higher heart weight (p = 0.003) but not with hypertension (p = 0.11). Conclusion: RMICTs appear to originate as a proliferation of renomedullary interstitial cells entrapping renal tubules. As size increases, cellularity decreases, amyloid-like material is deposited and tubules disappear. Ten patients were males and four were females with a mean age of 57.28 years. Ten patients had radical nephrectomy, three had nephroureterectomy and only one had partial nephrectomy. Microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of verrucous SCC in three cases and classic SCC in 11 of them. The latter type was well differentiated in seven cases and moderately differentiated in only two. Seven tumours showed necrosis. Invasion of the renal vein existed in two cases. Chronic pyelonephritis was found in all cases. According to the WHO classification system, eight tumours were staged as pT4, three as pT3, two as pT1 and one as pTis. Five patients had metastasis. The death rate was 1OO% after 5 years.",

Objective: Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPRCC) is a novel tumour entity that was recently recognized as a new distinct epithelial tumour within the current classification system. It is composed of cells with clear cytoplasm lining cystic, tubular, and papillary structures. The aim is to elucidate the spectrum of morphologic and immunohistochemical findings of a new recent entity. Method: A 67-year-old man with no history of End stage renal disease was admitted to our medical center with right flank pain. An ultrasound scan revealed a mass in the right kidney. His subsequent computed tomography scan revealed a mass on right kidney, measured 4.5 cm diameter. Patient underwent right nephrectomy. He was discharged at postoperative third day, without any complication. Results: On macroscopic examination, the tumour was solid and yellowbrown color. On microscopy examination, the tumour showed mixed areas of tubular and papillary structures. The papillae are covered with a single layer of clear cells with low-grade nuclei. The nuclei exhibit a characteristic linear arrangement away from the basal aspect of cells. Foamy macrophages, tumour necrosis, and vascular invasion are not seen. The tumour cells were positive for CK7 and negative for P504 and CD10. The diagnosis of CCPRCC was retained. Conclusion: CCPRCC may pose diagnostic difficulties, where it may be mistaken for RCC with clear cell and papillary features. Attention to gross and histologic features, and appropriate immunohistochemical and molecular studies, should help distinguish CCPRCC from its mimickers.

A custom bioinformatics pipeline was used to identify variants and query the 1000 Genomes database to aid in the identification of germline variants and the COSMIC and cBioportal databases for known cancer association(s). SIFT and PolyPhen-2 predictions were used to evaluate variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Results: Adult YST showed a total of 246 genomic variants. Somatic variants were filtered for known or likely deleterious effects; 15 genes harbored clinically significant (CS) mutations or variants of unknown significance (VUS) in a subset of cases. These genes and associated pathway members also showed germline variation in the remaining patients, with protein prediction suggesting a putative effect on protein function. Frequently altered genes include those involved in histone modification and DNA mismatch repair. Alterations in adherens junction/Wnt/APC pathway, splicing factor changes, and voltage-gated ion channel genes were also observed. Two known oncogenic mutations were identified: KRAS p.K117N, a signal transduction GTPase and CTNNB1 p.D32V, a transcription factor. The 3 pediatric YST showed a total of 101 variants, which were distinct from adult YST. Conclusion: Our data suggests that unique defects in DNA repair and altered histone modification are common in adult pure YST and may contribute to the pathogenesis of this unusual tumour.

The aim was to assess sub-stadifications in a single-center patient's series. Method: One hundred and seventy two T1 bladder tumours were classified according to the two sub-stadifications systems, T1a/T1b (superficial /deep lamina propria invasion) and T1m/e (invasion in a single focus within one HPF/other T1). Uni-and multivariable analyses were performed in order to assess the association of these classifications with disease recurrence/progression. Results: A modification of the m/e system was proposed : T1M (invasion in one or multiples focus within one HPF each) and T1E (invasion above one HPF). Median follow-up was 5years. Objective: To evaluate intra-and peritumoural LVD through immunohistochemical expression of D2-40 in relation to claudin-4 expression and clinicopathological parameters in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Method: Immunohistochemical staining procedure was performed on 53 paraffin-embedded blocks of radical prostatectomy specimens for prostatic adenocarcinoma using anti D2-40 and claudin-4 antibodies. Sections were evaluated for mean LVD in intratumoural and peritumoural tissues assessed by D2-40 expression. Results: LVD in intratumoural tissues was significantly lower compared with peritumoural areas (P = .0001). Peritumoural mean LVD was significantly higher in cases with lymphovascular invasion (P = .041) and in cases with positive lymph node metastasis (P = .003) than intratumoural mean LVD. High claudin-4 expression was significantly correlated with high tumour grade (P = .0001), lymphovascular invasion (P = .006), and positive lymph node metastasis (P = .004). High claudin-4 expression was significantly associated with increased mean LVD in peritumoural tissues. Conclusion: Increased peritumoural mean LVD in prostatic adenocarcinoma is associated with lymphovascular invasion and positive lymph node metastasis. High claudin-4 expression is associated with high tumour grade, lymphocascular invasion, positive lymph node metastasis, and high mean peritumoural LVD suggesting that D2-40 and claudin-4 may represent different mechanisms of lymphatic vessel invasion with both biomarkers is related to poor prognosis.

Both were from women, with 59 and 73 years, within the reported gender predominance and age range (13-81). One tumour presented classic morphology, low nuclear grade and only focal papillations; differential diagnosis included papillary (solid variant) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and sarcomatoid change in RCC. Conversely, the other tumour was predominanty composed by spindled cell component; presented a higher nuclear grade and numerous cells with clear or vacuolated cytoplasm; differential diagnosis included mainly clear cell RCC with sarcomatoid change. Indeed, a clear cell RCC diagnosis was rendered in pre-surgery core-biopsy. Sarcomatoid change, seldom described in MTSCC reported cases (<10 %), was absent in our cases. Both tumours were kidney confined and displayed CK7 (multifocal) and vimentin immunostaining. Conclusion: MTSCC is a rare renal tumour that might present a broad spectrum of morphologic appearances. Awareness of these uncommon morphologies might be determinant to achieve correct diagnosis and immunohistochemistry might be helpful in difficult cases. Objective: Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the second most common type of renal cell carcinoma and is morphologically separated into 2 subtypes. We reviewed the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of 15 cases. Method: Clinical records, histopathological and immunohistochemical slides of PRCC from our archive from 2003 to 2016. Results: Of a total of 188 cases, 15 PRCC cases were identified (6 type 1, 8 type 2, and 1 mixed), 11 male and 4 female. Mean age was 59.8 years for type 1 and 58.6 years for type 2. Mean tumour size was 3.1 cm for type 1 and 3.3 cm for type 2. Type 2 tumours had higher nuclear grade than type 1 tumours. Mean follow-up was 36 months .

ERG-positive nuclear staining of PIN cells occurs in 15 % of the 60 % ERG-positive PCa. To assess the predictive value of features that were significantly more often detected in PIN located in the vicinity of the PCa, 62 cases of repeat biopsies which were diagnosed previously with PIN were analyzed. PCa was detected in 30.6 % of patients in repeat biopsy group. 15 cases were referred to the group with high level of AMACR expression, 47-with the absence of AMACR expression. ERG expression was detected in only 2 patients of this group. Two-sided lesion, PIN multifocality and cribriform PIN occurred significantly more often in the first biopsy in patients who were subsequently diagnosed with cancer. In multivariate analysis, multifocal lesions, cribriform PIN, PIN with high expression of AMACR were independent predictors of PCa detection in consecutive biopsies. Conclusion: Morphological and immunophenotypical features of PIN associated with prostate cancer were determined, which may help in making a decision on whether to perform repeat biopsy or not.",

Method: Multifocal needle biopsies and radical prostatectomy specimens of patients with prostate cancer in the settings of age-related androgen deficiency and metabolic syndrome, and without aforementioned settings (16 and 30 patients, respectively), were analyzed. Results: It was found that in patients with age-related disorders of androgen status and metabolic syndrome, prostate cancer has a higher proliferative activity of tumour cells according to the expression of Ki-67, CyclinD1, TopoII\u03b1, more frequent expression of EGFR, absence of VEGF expression, more infrequent decrease in Bax expression, more frequent decrease in AR expression, ER\u00df, an increased frequency of ERa expression and Arom expression.

Histopathological evaluation of left testis revealed a cyst lined by keratinizing squamous epithelium and filled with keratin debris without dermal appendages or teratomatous elements. Right testis had a cyst lined by keratinizing squamous epithelium and sebaceous glands without noncutaneous teratomatous elements.

An undescended testis focally infiltrated by the above tumour was also found. Conclusion: A variety of germ cell tumours of the testis have been reported in association with PMDS. As regards management of Mullerian remnants, most authors suggest leaving these structures in situ, because of the difficulty in dissection and the presumed absence of risk of malignancy.

Tumour cells were positive for DOG 1 and CD34, and negative for CD117. Conclusion: There are less than 10 bladder EGISTs described to date, and there are insufficient data about their risk of progression. DOG 1 is the most sensitive marker for the diagnosis of EGISTs since they are frequently CD 117 negative. Objective: Stage pT1 urothelial carcinomas constitute a heterogeneous group with a different risk of progression. We have applied the recently developed molecular classification of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (two types: basal and luminal) to a group of pT1 urothelial carcinomas. Method: Immunohistochemistry was performed on sections from tissue arrays (85 samples from 45 different pT1 high grade urothelial carcinomas). A multimer-based method was applied in an automatic stainer (Ventana) using antibodies against CK5, CD44, CK20, p53 and ERBB2. Results: 29 (64,4 %) cases were categorized as luminal (CK 5-, CD44-, CK20+) and 3 (6.7 %) as basal (CK5+, CD44+, CK20-) subtypes. 13 cases (28.9 %) had overlapping results or no immunoexpression, and were not classifiable. P53 was positive in 18 (62,1 %) luminal and 1 of the 3 basal cases. ERBB2 was 3+ in 10 (34,5 %) luminal and 2 of the 3 basal cases. Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry aids to classify urothelial carcinomas as basal or luminal types although it is not conclusive in some cases. Most of the pT1 carcinomas are of luminal type, with a large proportion of p53+, and only one third ERBB2 3+. Larger studies are needed to elucidate a possible relevance of classification of pT1 carcinomas as basal type for treatment or follow up.",

Results: By analyzing both Gleason systems (an average score and prognostic groups) comparing groups with a positive and negative margin, a significantly larger Gleason score was found in group with a positive margin (p = 0.003). The significant correlation of biochemical recurrence with new Gleason prognostic groups was also found (p = 0,048) but not in patients with tumours with positive margins after prostatectomy.

Objective: Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) methylate a variety of histones, RNA-binding proteins, enzymes, small molecules, and has been linked to several malignancies. Method: Real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of PRMT1 mRNA level was analyzed in 15 clear cell, 6 papillary and 3 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCC), and compared to its expression in normal kidney tissue adjacent to the tumour. Furthermore, PRMT1 mRNA level was correlated to tumour stage, nuclear grade and tumour dimension. Survival analysis was also performed to define predictors of cancer-related death. Results: PRMT1 mRNA level was almost three times lower in all tumours compared to its expression in non-tumour kidney tissues (p < 0.001). There was tendency of decline in PRMT1 mRNA level by each increase in tumour stage (T1:0.45; T2:0.36; T3:0.34). Moreover, tumours with higher nuclear grades (III-IV) had highly down-regulated PRMT1 mRNA level (0.29) that was lower than those observed in nuclear grade I-II (0.42). Correlation of PRMT1 mRNA levels and tumour dimensions was not statistically confirmed, despite detection of clear negative trend. Nuclear stage, tumour grade and renal vein invasion were predictors of cancer-related death, while mRNA PRMT1 level did not influence patients' survival.

Spermatocytic seminoma affects more frequently males with descended testis. Method: We retrospectively explored our archival material searching for the diagnosis of seminoma and/or spermatocytic seminoma during the 10-years period (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . Results: We found three cases of spermatocytic seminoma during the 10years period (rate~0.04 %). One tumour was diagnosed in older male (60 years old) while the other two spermatocytic seminoma cases were diagnosed in young males (29 and 33 years old, respectively). None of the patients had previous history of cryptorchidism. Two patients were clinically suspicious of testicular cancer while the third one (29yo) had clinical diagnosis of purulent orchitis and semitorsion. Histopathologic examination revealed morphologic features of spermatocytic seminoma confirmed by immunohistochemistry. All three patients received no adjuvant treatment and did well at last check-up. Conclusion: Spermatocytic seminoma is a rare variant of testicular seminoma that also may be seen in young adults. Surgical treatment appears to be optimal with an excellent clinical outcome. Objective: There is controversy surrounding the optimal management of the testicular remnant associated with the testicular regression syndrome (TRS). Some authors advocate the need for surgical exploration, whereas others believe this unnecessary. These differing opinions are based on the variable reports of viable germ cell elements found within the testicular remnants. This study aimed to quantify the cardinal features of the disease and to determine the incidence of viable germ cells.",

Microscopic evaluation showed haemosiderin-laden macrophages in 5 cases (8.5 %), dystrophic calcification in 7 cases (11.7 %), vas deferens in 50 cases (83.3 %), epididymal tissue in 34 cases (56.7 %) and Leydig cells in 16 cases (26.7 %). Seminiferous tubules were noted in 21 cases (35 %) and germ cells were only identified in 2 cases (3.3 %). No atypical germ cells were seen. Conclusion: Viable germ cells were only found in 3.3 % of examined remnants implying a negligible risk of future germ-cell cancerisation and minimizing the need for their systematic removal. Objective: While the currently used clinical and pathological variables provide prognostic information on Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB); they still have a limited ability to predict tumour progression. Cancer cells exhibit a wide range of mitochondrial dysfunctions that could provide a possibility to preferentially target cancer cell mitochondria and improve therapeutic selectivity. TOMM34 is one of the translocases of the outer membrane of mitochondria (Tom) components that was identified a crucial factor for the protein import. The aim is to investigate the expression pattern of TOMM34 in bladder cancer and its correlation with the clinico-pathological parameters of those cases. Method: Sixty patients with non-invasive (high grade and low grade) and invasive urothelial carcinoma (high grade and low grade) were included in the study in. The immunohistochemical expression was performed using the TOMM34 antibody (Novus Biologicals, USA). Results: TOMM34 immunohistochemical expression was significantly higher in muscle invasive tumours (p < 0.01) and in WHO-ISUP high grade tumours (p < 0.01). Higher TOMM34 protein levels were associated with decreased overall survival of patients with UCB (Chi-square 27.9 and p < 0.01). Conclusion: TOMM34 is a potential poor prognostic factor in UCB, and further functional studies could unravel its possible role as a therapeutic target in UCB. Objective: Nuclear grading (NG) is not routinely applied to prostatic carcinoma (PCa). This study evaluated NG as a predictor of PCa outcomes in a cohort of radical prostatectomy (RP) patients. Method: 1579 patients with PCa treated by RP were enrolled in a multicenter national database. Whole-mount specimens were graded by the 2014 modification of ISUP/Gleason and nuclear grade as defined by Mostofi. Outcomes data were obtained as part of ongoing data collection. Unadjusted Kaplan Meier (KM) estimation curves and multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards analyses were used to evaluate two time-to-event endpoints: biochemical recurrence (BCR) and distant metastasis (MET).",

KM curves showed a significant difference in odds of BCR (p < 0.0001) and MET (p < 0.0001) with poorer outcomes for highest versus lowest NG. Multivariable analysis showed higher risk of MET for highest versus lowest NG category: (HR 3 vs. 1 = 21.39, p = 0.0049). In Gleason grade 7 tumours, NG3 had a significant association with BCR (p < .0001) and metastasis-free survival (p = .01), compared to NG1-2 tumours. Conclusion: NG is useful in predicting worse PCa outcomes, especially in Gleason grade 7 tumours. Results: 245 consecutive patients with invasive BC were identified: 84 (33.07 %) OW, 72 (29.38 %) OB and 91 (37.14) NW. Most of the OW and OB women were aged >40 (0.0092). Also, OW patients had higher rates of grade 1 tumour (0.0138). NW patients had significantly less lymph nodes metastases (p = 0.0165) comparing to OW/OB group. There were no statistically significant differences between these three groups and tumour size, histological type, inflammatory cell infiltration and the presence of emboli. Conclusion: In our series, BC patients had a high prevalence of OB/OW, mostly over the age of 40. OB group is associated with poor prognostic factors (lymph node metastasis). However, most of the tumours in the OW group were of grade 1 histologically. Objective: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Livin, the most recently identified IAP, is one the most tumour-specific genes in the human genome. Its role in breast cancer progression remains unknown, the expression pattern of livin gene in human breast cancer tissues and its correlation with the prognostic factors including patient outcome was evaluated. Method: The surgically resected 34 breast cancer tissue specimens were analyzed and examined by immunostaining to evaluate the expression pattern of livin protein. All patients were followed up for disease-free and overall survival. Results: Livin protein was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm of tumour cells. The positive expression was observed in 88.2 % (30 out of -Thursday, 29 September 2016 .3 E-PS-01 Breast Pathology 34) cases of breast carcinoma specimens analyzed. Livin gene expression was significantly correlated with tumour size. (P \u2264 0.05) No statistical significant correlation was detected between livin gene expression and patient's age, menstrual status, tumour grade, axillary lymph node metastasis, ER, PR hormonal status and HER-2 receptor status. (P 0.05) There was a statistical significant correlation between livin gene expression and TNM tumour stage. (P \u2264 0.05) Patients with livin positive breast cancer tumours had a poor disease-free survival and a shorter overall survival in comparison with livin negative tumours, although the difference was not statistically significant. (P 0.05) Conclusion: We conclude that, the high expression pattern of livin gene in breast carcinoma may play a prominent role for disease progression. Livin expression may help predict the poor clinical outcome and could be useful as a molecular biomarker and therapeutic target for effective breast cancer therapy. Objective: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is second most common breast carcinoma. ILC is also famous for distinctive metastatic sites which are different from those of the other carcinomas of the breast. We report a case of ILC in a 57-year-old woman who visited the hospital with increased postmenopausal vaginal bleeding for 1 month. Method: Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The uterus and both adnexa were grossly normal except an increased myometrial thickness and hemorrhagic foci within myometrium which are the most common features of adenomyosis. Results: Microscopically, dyscohesive cells with mild nuclear pleomorphism infiltrated uterine cervix, endometrial stroma, myometrium, and both adnexa. Adenomyosis was found in the myometrium and was also infiltrated by the tumour cells. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for estrogen receptor and cytokeratin 7, and negative for CD10, vimentin, and E-cadherin. Ki-67 index was approximately 10 %. Examination of her breasts was done after the tumour was diagnosed as metastatic ILC. Needle biopsies of the breasts revealed ILC in both breasts. Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins, E-cadherin, and CD10 should be concerned when atypical dyscohesive cells are found in the endometrial specimen to rule out ILC.",

However, it emphasizes the possibility of individual tumour variation at a molecular level. Heterogeneous tumours potentially present a challenge for clinicians, as may have impact on treatment response, prognosis and disease outcome. Conclusion: We discovered the connection between the morphological intratumoural heterogeneity and molecular subtypes. It turned out that triple-negative tumours are more frequently characterized by the presence of one type of morphological structure, while in the luminal BC there are tumours with five different types of structures. However, not in all patients basal-like breast tumours show significant intratumoural heterogeneity and triple-negative BC is not always a clonally homogeneous tumour. Thus, the analysis of morphological and molecular heterogeneity of BC is the basis for a better understanding of carcinogenesis and tumour progression mechanisms. Tumours with anaplastic component have not only a difference in the histological structure, but also in their malignant potential, as well as in the expression of epithelial, mesenchymal and immunohistochemical myoepithelial markers. Histologically,desmoplasia of the stroma, which is typical of DBC, is completely absent in anaplastic areas. Tumour cells create a semblance of stromal framework from themselves. Revealed cases of diffuse expression of vimentin, SMA and p63 in anaplastic cells confirm that in the process of differentiation loss, tumour cells acquire myoepithelial and/or mesenchymal phenotype. This fact is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in tumours. This results in the destruction of dense adhesion contacts (reduction and change in polarity of expression of E-cadherin) and the restructure of complexes, which provide the attachment of cells to the substrate. Conclusion: Heterogeneity of ductal carcinoma is manifested by the anaplastic (sarcomatoid) component, where we can trace the ability of epithelial tumour cells to acquire a properties of mesenchymal cells, which do not require the stroma and have an aggressive malignant potential, affecting the survival of patients.",

Method: Our patient is an 18 year old female who presented to hospital with chest pain. On examination, a palpable breast lump was noted. This was biopsied and initially found to be oestrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative and Her-2 negative with a proliferation index of 80-90 %. Further immunohistochemical testing showed the tumour cells to be positive for \u03b2-hCG, PLAP and AE1/AE3 and negative for CD30 and AFP. Imaging showed bilateral hilar masses, multiple lung nodules and a lesion in the right breast. There was no history of pregnancy and the uterus appeared normal on ultrasound scan. The patient was treated with four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) and follow up scans have shown a partial response to therapy. Results: Fifty-seven cases with MIC were distinguished from pure DCIS. The small angulated epithelial clusters were displayed distinctly in the stroma adjacent ducts by CKpan expression, with p63, SMMHC and Calponin negative. These clearly separated microscopic foci were one or more, with the maximum diameter 0.1~1.0 mm. Most of MIC was histological grade-II. The DCIS component ranged from 4 ducts to extensive distribution, 27 cases were high nuclear grade and 30 cases were moderate. The morphological subtypes of DCIS were mainly comedo and solid, others were cribriform and papillary. C-erbB-2 in 31 cases with MIC expressed 3+ or 2+, however, the intensity of 33 cases were lower than or equal to DCIS. Conclusion: Immunohistochemistry of CKpan, myoepithelial markers and c-erbB-2 could improve the detection rate of MIC, which highlighted more objectively the MIC ranges and benefited to precise individual therapy. Conclusion: The prognostic value of BC immunophenotypes persists when adjusting the age, the tumour diameter and the stage of the disease and this \"morphologic-molecular\" model was robust in relapse prediction and recurrence risk stratified by traditional prognostic parameters. Objective: Spindle cell lesions of the breast constitute a heterogenous group ranging from reactive to neoplastic, highly malignant disorders and their accurate diagnosis can be quite challenging. We report 3 cases of spindle cell lesions of the breast with emphasis on differential diagnosis. Method: All three patients were females, aged 24, 60 and 70 years, and presented with palpable masses in the left breast measuring 2, 5.3 and 3 cm in maximum diameter respectively. Results: The first lesion was a desmoid-type fibromatosis composed of intersecting fascicles of bland spindle cells, positive for SMA and \u03b2-catenin and negative for keratins. Histological diagnosis of the second lesion was nodular fasciitis. It was composed of short fascicles of plump fibroblastic/myofibroblastic cells (SMA+, Desmin-, \u03b2-catenin-, keratin-), with frequent mitoses, set in a loose, myxoid stroma containing lymphocytes, erythrocytes and thin-walled vessels. The third lesion was a metaplastic myoepithelial carcinoma composed mainly of atypical spindle cells, positive for keratins 5/6, p63 and CD10, with focal squamous and mesenchymal differentiation.",

Conclusion: During the study period, in the youngest subgroup age, the 5-year recurrence and death rates were higher than in older premenopausal patients. The relationship between age and treatment response was not directly correlated. Objective: This study aimed to analysis the relative risk (RR) of breast cancer-related recurrence on disease-free survival (DFS) in patients of less than 39 years of age. Method: Between January 2008 and June 2014, 84 women with operable breast cancer were admitted to the oncology department, for cures of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery and adjuvant treatments. Patients were stratified into two age groups (group 1, \u226439 years; group 2, >39 years). In a forward stepwise procedure, the following four selected parameters were entered in a Cox regression model: age (\u226439 years), tumour grade (G > 2), clinical stage and progesterone receptor (PR) status. Objective: Metastatic tumours involving the myocardium and endocardium are uncommonly encountered. It was our aim to evaluate the prevalence of these rare tumours and study their presentation in order to increase awareness to their existence. Method: Pathological reports from Sheba Medical Center (Israel) and medical records from Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases (Serbia) were screened for cases of metastatic cardiac tumours. Medical, radiological and pathological data of the identified cases was retrieved and reviewed. Results: We found less than a dozen cases of metastatic cardiac tumours out of thousands of registered cardiac surgeries. The metastatic tumours identified were melanoma, carcinomas of lung, colon and kidney and sarcomas of uterine origin. We found that metastatic cardiac tumours comprised 15.8 % of all the cardiac tumours. Imaging studies played a central role in the identification of cardiac masses. However, as differential diagnosis exists, primarily with thrombi, histopathological evaluation was required for definite diagnosis of metastatic cardiac disease. Conclusion: Metastatic cardiac tumours are extremely rare. As new diagnostic technologies and improved survival of oncological patients may increase the incidence of cardiac metastatic tumours in the future, awareness to their existence and knowledge of their presentation are key factors in their timely recognition. Objective: Primary cardiac angiosarcoma is an extremely rare entity with a dismal prognosis. Like other primary cardiac malignancies these tumours present with unspecific symptoms that may mimic other, more common cardiac conditions, thus making the diagnosis extremely challenging. Method: 46-year-old man, initial presentation with symptoms of a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. A week before his death the patient was referred to our institution with decreasing respiratory function. CT scans showed multiple disseminated cerebral and pulmonal foci, in the transesophageal echocardiography a mass was observed. Miliary tuberculosis, endocarditis with septic emboli, possible metastatic tumour of unknown primary as well as an acute exacerbation of the patient's coexisting sarcoidosis were considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and he died within days. Results: Clinical autopsy revealed numerous tumourous foci in nearly every organ and a tumour arising from the right atrium of the heart. Histomorphology and immunohistochemical profile were consistent with angiosarcoma. A previously not described KRAS mutation was detected in the molecularpathological analysis. Conclusion: Although the prognosis is devastating and ultimately fatal, early diagnosis followed by multimodal therapy improves the survival of primary cardiac angiosarcomas.",

Large areas of hemorrhage and necrosis and brisk mitoses were seen. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Conclusion: Awareness and strong clinical suspicion are important for the diagnosis of this rare tumour. Objective: Fabry disease (FD) is a rare disorder by mutation in gene encoding \u03b1-galactosidase enzyme wich metabolizes ceramidetrijexoside (Gb3); its alteration produces accumulation of Gb3 in lysosomes kidney, endothelial, myocardial, neurons and smooth muscle cells. We present a patient with severe heart failure wich the early diagnosis through a myocardial biopsy (MB) could improve his evolution. Method: 54 year old male with myopericarditis 4 years ago, chronic renal failure and hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy (HNC), without skin or corneal lesions. The diagnostic study included MB after 1 year. Results: The optical microscopy presented cells with abundant vacuoles, PAS negative and something positive with oil-red. In ultrastructural study (US) lipid inclusions, frequent electron-laminated or solid myocyte predominant type level, more isolated in endothelial cells were observed. The diagnosis was suggestive of FD. Conclusion: FD is inhered disorder with irreversible tissular accumulation of Gb3, despite replacement therapy, so the diagnosis through MB should be early. Gb3 deposits found in this biopsy were diffuse, altering all cell structures. In this sense, our patient, 5 years ago, presented myopericarditis with incipient ventricular hypertrophy, probably, as the beginning of FD. In conclusion, we emphasize the value of MB with US in MNC and to consider starting early enzyme replacement therapy. Objective: Primary cardiac neoplasms are rare.

Both external and internal autopsy observations were evaluated. Results: Autopsy examination identified advanced decompositional changes in all organs and calcified masses within the aortic cusps with protrusion through the outflow surface. Routine histopathological examination of the aortic valves revealed metaplastic lamellar bone and complete extramedullary hematopoiesis, consisting of erythroid cells, myeloid cells, megakaryocytes and adipose tissue. Conclusion: The pathways in the mechanism of the heterotopic calcification on cardiac valves could be related to some inflammatory, metabolic or genetic causes, but the presence of extramedullary hematopoiesis and extent of this condition on clinical status is poorly understood. Objective: Cardiac tumours are very rare with an autopsy incidence; 0.001-0.03 % and cardiac myxoma is the most common primary cardiac tumour. They are usually seen in female and in adult people, but rarely in children. Myxomas may be sporadic or part of genetic conditions. The cell origin of cardiac myxoma is still controversial and its histogenesis is making a sensation. Method: We evaluate four cardiac myxomas histologically and with immunohistochemistry methods. There was no evidence that they were part of genetic condition; Carney complex. In histologic examination all of the tumours were charachterized by the presence of stellate, polygonal (lepidic) cells in an amorphous, basophilic, afibrillar myxoid stroma containing mucopolysaccharides. Four cardiac myxomas were examined by immunohistochemical analysis with PGP 9.5, S100 and NSE. Results: In histologic examination all of the tumours were charachterized by the presence of stellate, polygonal (lepidic) cells in an amorphous, basophilic, afibrillar myxoid stroma containing mucopolysaccharides. All four myxoma showed positive immunohistochemically staining with PGP 9.5, NSE and S100. Conclusion: Altough the histogenesis of the cardiac myxoma is not obvious, it is postulated that they develop from multipotent mesenchymal stem. Herein we aimed to show the neuroectodermal origin of myxoma by immunohistochemically staining with neuroendocrine differentiation markers. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, gelatinase B) in left ventricular myocardium in the presence of chronic myocardial ischemia.

Objective: The synovial is a rare site of tumour metastases with less than 40 cases reported in the literature. Although melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer, only two cases of synovial metastases have been reported. The aim of this case is to attract the attention of clinicians and pathologists on the importance of intra-articular metastatic localization including synovium. Method: The patient was 73 years old with no notable medical history. She complained of joint pain mimicking a knee sprain. Physical examination showed a swollen knee, red and painful. Radiological examination revealed a filling the joint space. A biopsy of synovium was practiced. Results: Microscopic examination showed a malignant tumour proliferation largely necrotic arranged in clumps or small nests within an inflammatory stroma. Tumour cells had eosinophilic cytoplasm without pigment melanin. The nuclei were large and highly mitotic with a prominent nucleolus. The immunohistochemical study objectified positivity of tumour cells for HMB45, vimentin and CD99. They were in contrast negative for CK, EMA and desmin. The diagnosis of synovial locating of cutaneous melanoma was retained. Conclusion: Metastasis of melanoma at the synovium is very rare. They generally occur at the stage of disseminated disease. The treatment is palliative. Results: It is histologically similar to salivary gland mixed tumours where, proliferation of epithelial and myoepithelial cells set in a myxomatous, chondromatous, or hyalined stroma. Mixed tumours composed of five histological criteria for diagnosis: 1) cuboidal or polygonal cell nests 2) tubuloalveolar structures lined with two or more rows of cuboidal cells 3) ductal structures with one or two rows of cuboidal cells 4) keratinous cysts 5) a matrix of varying composition. CS may have all five characteristics or manifest only some. Conclusion: The CS, or mixed tumour of the skin, was first described by Hirsch and Helwig, as a benign neoplasm of sweat gland origin and a rare clinical entity. The incidence of CS is <0.01 % of all primary skin tumours. It is usually located in the skin of the head and neck. Rare localization areas are the axilla, abdomen, trunk, genitalia and extremities in patients between the age of 20 and 60 years with a male predominance. CS lesions usually are not clinically distinctive and the diagnosis is made on microscopic examination. Objective: Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP) is a very rare cutaneous neoplasm, representing the malignant counterpart of syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP). Only 28 cases have been reported, 9 of them as carcinoma in situ.

Objective: Mohs micrographic surgery is distinguished by histologic examination of the complete surgical margin prepared from fresh frozen tissue. The purpose is to achieve the examination in one section of the undersurface, the sidewall, and the epidermal margin. To do so, the specimen must be manipulated before freezing, flattening it. Method: We compare 34 cases frozen by traditional method over a year, with 9 cases frozen by PrestoCHILL\u00ae over 3 months. Results: Traditional method required a mean of 15 slides while the new one only 10. Also the number of frozen blocks needed downgraded from 1.9 to 1. Freezing quality was also improved, and holes and tears seen in fat were also reduced. Conclusion: The manipulation of the skin while freezing is one of the pitfalls of this technique, since the flattening of tissue is done against gravity, and epidermal margins usually \"fall\". The solution to this particular problem requires several serial sections or cutting the specimen in more than 1 frozen block to solve. We tested PrestoCHILL\u00ae device to freeze the tissue, since the freezing is made faster and in contact of a flat metal surface, facing the margin (favored by gravity).

Objective: Panniculitis is a rare emerging side effect of BRAF inhibitor(BRAFi) therapy used to treat patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma. Only 18 cases are documented in the literature. Method: We present two additional cases and review the clinicopathological findings of the cases reported to date. Results: Patient 1 was a 65-year-old female who presented with fever, rash, generalized arthralgia and painful nodules in the inferior and superior limbs panniculitis with a mixed infiltrate with numerous neutrophils and foci of necrosis and apoptosis. A diagnosis of vemurafenib-associated neutrophilic panniculitis was rendered and vemurafenib dosage was reduced with complete resolution of the lesions. Patient 2 was a 35-year-old female who, after 6 weeks of treatment with vemurafenib, developed painful nodules in the the inferior limbs. A punch biopsy showed a lobular panniculitis with neutrophilic infiltration without vasculitis. A diagnosis of vemurafenib-associated neutrophilic panniculitis was rendered. She was started on steroids with total remission of the lesions. Conclusion: BRAFi associated panniculitis can present under a range of histological presentations, documented in the literature and in our cases. As clinical course is generally benign, recognition of this side effect is important in order to prevent BRAFi discontinuation. Results: SC was more frequent in males and most commonly presented as a nodular ulcerated mass. Histopathologically, there were varying architectural patterns with irregular solid lobules of basaloid cells and variable sebocytic differentiation, areas of comedo-necrosis(four cases) and/or squamous differentiation(three cases); duct or cystic differentiation was seen too; one case was associated with SC \"in situ\" and pagetoid invasion of supraiacent epidermis. Infiltration of subcutaneous fat/skeletal muscle was evident in three cases. Six tumours were grade 2. All SCs presented at least focal positivity for EMA and adipophilin and intense p53 nuclear staining. None of them showed microsatellite instability. Conclusion: In our experience, SC is a rare tumour with morphology similar to BCC and SCC; EMA and adipophilin facilitate appropriate diagnosis. Objective: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a multifocal vascular neoplasia characterized by angioproliferative multifocal tumours, affecting mainly the skin. Lymphangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma (LLKS) variant is a rare morphologic expression, accounting for less than 5 % of all KS cases. Method: The first patient was a 76-year-old woman with erythematous plaque on right foot (3-4 cm). The second, a 61-year-old woman with erythematous papules on legs, arms and nose (<1 cm). The third, a 48year-old man with violaceous plaque (10 \u00d7 4cm) and numerous papules on left foot. Biopsies were performed, with subsequent studies through microscopy with HE staining. Results: Histopathological examination of specimens revealed a proliferation of dilated anastomosing empty channels lined by flattened endothelial cells, dissecting the dermis and surrounding pre-existing blood vessels in some areas. Lymphocytes and plasma cells were present in the stroma adjacent to vascular channels. Typical areas of KS were not present. Immunohistochemical studies for HHV8 and D2-40 revealed positive staining. Conclusion: LLKS variant of KS is very uncommon. Bulla-like lessions have been considered as a clinical hallmark. When findings of typical KS are not found, differential diagnosis with other vascular tumours may be difficult. Positive staining for HHV-8 can be useful to distinguish it from its mimics.

            "text": "A 51 year-old man, without relevant previous clinical history, was referred to our hospital due to a large (18 cm dimension) cutaneous/ subcutaneous congenital lesion localized in the occipital region. The lesion was partially removed (spindle shape specimen, measuring 7.2 \u00d7 3.6 \u00d7 3.0 cm). Results: The epidermis was slightly brownish and lobulated. Histology revealed a complex lesion with interfolicular growth pattern, displaying nests with common melanocytic nevus and blue nevus-like features, neurofibroma and perineurioma-like components, characterized by immunohistochemistry. There were no signs of malignancy. Diagnosis: NCH. Conclusion: NCH is a complex hamartomatous lesion. The diagnosis might be challenging and misleading if not recognised. Due to the variability of NHC features it may raise several differential diagnoses, namely pigmented neurofibroma. Importantly, NCH has high propensity to melanoma transformation, but with better prognosis than classical melanomas. Objective: High risk Human papillomavirus (HR HPV) infection in non melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was reported in several studies but its role in the development of these tumours is not yet established. To assess the involvement of HPV in the carcinogenesis of NMSC we evaluated the expression of Tp53 according to HPV infection. Method: 51 NMSC formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues (21 squamous cell carcinoma, 13 keratoacanthoma and 17 basal cell carcinoma) were enrolled. HPV detection was performed by nested PCR (PGMY09/ PGMY11/GP5+/GP6+) and reverse line blot hybridization. The immunohistochemical expression of Tp53 was investigated using P53 monoclonal antibody (Novocastra). Tp53 was considered as over expressed if more than 30 % of nuclei stained positive. Results: HPV positive samples account for 50.9 % (26/51). HR HPV types were found in 80.1 % (21/26). Over expression of Tp53 was observed in 64 % of HPV negatives and it was significantly associated with the absence of HPV infection (p = 0.08). The over expression of Tp53 was not associated with the histological type of tumour. However, negative staining of Tp53 was found in 81 % of HR HPV types (p = 0.064). Conclusion: This study shows an inverse correlation between HPV infection and Tp53 positive staining. This could be explained, as in cervical cancer, by the role of E6 in the degradation of p53. Hence mucosal HR HPV could be involved in skin cancer carcinogenesis. Objective: Wilms tumour gene (WT1) is a tumour-suppressor gene located at chromosome 11p13 and antibodies against the product of this gene applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue have become available. These antibodies may stain both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells but only the nuclear immunreactivity must be evaluated for WT1 gene. Method: The expression levels of WT1 gene were examined in 60 primary thyroid neoplasms(30 papillary carcinomas, 30 follicular neoplasms) and 30 benign thyroid tissues (adenomatous hyperplasia) immunohistochemically. Results: There wasn't any difference between three groups and no expression of this gene product was detected in all groups. Only cytoplasmic staining that we ignored in oncocytic cells was seen. Conclusion: Nuclear reactivity of WT1 was shown in some kinds of tumours like Wilms tumour, mesothelioma,serous carcinomas of ovary and peritoneum, metanephric adenoma, as well as some types of leukemia. Papillary structures and psammoma bodies can be seen in papillary throid carcinoma as well as ovarian and peritoneal serous papillary carcinomas. Although, these two tumours resemble each other histopathologically, there was no expression of WT1 gene product in papillary throid carcinomas in our study. These findings showed that in the tumourigenesis of primary throid carcinomas WT-1gene has no role. Objective: To demostrate a rare case of isolated pituitary sarcoidosis in a 26-year-old man. Method: A 26-year-old patient complaining of a decrease in semen volume but without loss of libido sought advice from the urologist. Class III obesity, testicle shrinking, decreasing the blood level of pituitary hormones, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism were found. MRI showed a sellar region tumour with infra-, supra-and parasellar extension. Clinical preoperative diagnosis was a craniopharyngioma. Transnasal transsphenoidal surgery was performed to remove the tumour. Histological samples were stained with haematoxylin-eosin, Masson's trichrome, CD3, CD38, CD68, HLA-DR, chromogranin A, synaptophisin. Results: A histologic study of the pituitary gland showed granulomas similar in size and morphology. They consisted of multinucleated giant cells, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes and a peripheral rim of fibrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed rimmed granulomas. The central distribution of CD68+ cells and the peripheral distribution of CD3+ were detected. A chest CT scan revealed no evidence of thoracic pathology. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis for sarcoidosis in the pituitary gland after the MRI results is quite complicated. Immunohistochemical analysis enables to detect the monomorphic granulomas and to distinguish sarcoidosis from other granulomatous processes. Objective: Hypophysitis is a rare disease of pituitary gland. We report 5 cases of primary and secondary hypophysitis. Method: Among 207 examined pituitary masses removed through a transnasal-transsphenoidal approach, we reveal 5 cases of hypophysitis. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of the pituitary gland, biochemical testing of pituitary hormone blood levels, histological examination with haematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome staining were performed in this cases. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical assay was carried out using antibodies to all pituitary hormones, Ki-67, CD3, CD38, CD45, CD68, HLA-DR. Results: Hypophysitis was diagnosed only morphologically in 2 women and 4 men at the age from 23 to 55 years. MRI showed an increase in the size of pituatuiry gland in 4 cases, 1 case was with cystic changes and 1 case was diagnosed as a craniopharyngioma. The morphological study identified the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate with fibrosis in all cases and with necrosis in one case. HLA-DR expression was observed in all cases. Secondary hypophysitis was diagnosed in 2 cases. Conclusion: Hypophysitis remains challenging to diagnose, because its clinical and imaging features are not specific to distinguish from those of pituitary tumours. The IHC/morphology analysis is the method of choice. Objective: ATRX is part of a chromatin remodeling complex that plays an important role in the repression of the Alternative Lengthening of the Telomeres pathway, preventing the continuous maintenance of the telomeres and the infinite proliferation of the cells. Inactivating mutations of ATRX characterize diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas. We present a case of two metachronous pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms with loss of ATRX expression. Method: A male patient presented with multiple liver metastasis, received three different therapeutic regimens within 5 years after which a new liver biopsy was performed. Results: The first liver biopsy showed a G2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour which was Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, PDX-1 and Isl1 positive and CDX-2, PAX8, Progesterone negative. Insulin was detected in <5 % and the ki-67 index was 10 %. Five years later the new biopsy showed a G3 pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma which was focally and weakly TTF-1 positive and strongly CDX-2 positive while it was Isl1 and Insulin negative. ki-67 was 85 %. In both neoplasms ATRX was negative. Conclusion: According to literature inactivating mutations of ATRX are common in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Loss of ATRX protein is associated with hepatic metastasis and decreased overall survival, although the tumour cells are more sensitive to agents such as 5-fluoracil. Objective: Actually with the current progress of the management of thyroid cold nodules and the improvement of pathological practices, there is a significant increase in the incidence of cancer Method: This descriptive study allows to identify retrospectively the number of cases of thyroid cancer in the pathology department of the University Hospital of Constantine during the period 2012-2014. The addressed surgical specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin. A thorough macroscopic examination of the piece, samples according lesions were performed. Lymph node dissection is included in full. After processing and inclusion of sections with a thickness of 3 \u03bcm thickness were cut and stained in eosin Hemalun .A immunohistochemical study with different antibodies was performed according to the diagnostic orientation. Results: In total, our series of 84 cases of thyroid cancer of all types collected during this period (2012) (2013) (2014) . The female thyroid cancer is evident in our series with a sex ratio female / male 3/1. The average age is 45 years for both sexes and the minimum age is 18 years. Of the 84 cases of thyroid cancer collected, 82 % are papillary carcinoma, 8 % are vesicular carcinomas, 5 % are poorly differentiated carcinomas. Anaplastic carcinoma and medullary carcinoma Each one represents 2.5 % of each of thyroid cancers. One case of Langerhans cell histiocytosis was objectified. Conclusion: The thyroid cancer is among the few tumours represent only 01 % of cancers of the entire body. However, mastery of the decision tree we observe a significant increase in the incidence of cancer that occurs mainly at the expense of papillary microcarcinomas good prognosis. Objective: Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease (PPNAD) accounts for approximately 10 % of ACTH independent Cushing's syndrome, 50 % being sporadic and 50 % familial; associated with Carney complex. PPNAD is characterized by brown-black pigmented adrenocortical nodules. We present a rare case of PPNAD in Carney complex with strong familial association. Method: 21-year old female presented with features of Cushing's syndrome (weight gain, moon face, abdominal striae, hirsuitism and proximal muscle weakness, hypertension & diabetes) of 2 years' duration, lentigenes on the lower lip and medial aspect of the conjunctiva, multiple hyperpigmented spots over lower lips and eye lids. Breast nodularity noted. Basal cortisol was raised and ACTH normal. An uncle & three first cousins also showed lentigenes and similar pigmentation. CT abdomen showed bilateral multinodular adrenal enlargement. Patient underwent bilateral adrenalectomy and surgical specimens subjected to histological examination. Results: Both adrenals showed characteristic gross and microscopic features of PPNAD. The patient fulfilled diagnostic criteria of Carney complex. A strong paternal familial association observed. Conclusion: Patients with histopathological diagnosis of PPNAD should be investigated for Carney complex and familial association. Molecular genetic testing for characteristic mutation of the PRKAR1A gene is conclusive. Bilateral adrenalectomy indicated as mortality is same as in Cushing's syndrome. Objective: Oncocytic neoplasms of the adrenal glands are rare, usually nonfunctional and mostly benign. Herein, we report a case of an oncocytic carcinoma arising in the cortex of the right adrenal gland. Results: In a female patient, 55-years-old suffering from multiple sclerosis a right nonfunctional adrenal gland mass was found incidentally 3 years ago. During the last year the mass increased rapidly in size and was surgically excised. In the Pathology laboratory we received the right adrenal gland measuring 7.8 \u00d7 6.5 \u00d7 5 cm and weighting 94.8 g. Upon sectioning a circumscribed, encapsulated mass measuring 5.5 cm in greatest dimension and surrounded by a thin rim of normal-appearing adrenal gland, was noted. The mass was yellow-tan and exhibited a central radiating, stellate grey zone, of softer consistency. Microscopically, the neoplastic cells were arranged diffusely, in trabeculae or nests. The cells were large, polygonal with abundant granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm, with large hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei. The mitoses were numerous, many of them atypical. Microscopic areas of necrosis were also noted. Upon immunohistochemical evaluation the neoplastic cells were positive for: vimentin, Melan A, synaptophysin and inhibin (focally) and were negative for: cytokeratins 7, 8, 14, 18 and 20, EMA, chromogranin, CD3 and CD163 . Peripherally, a thin rim of residual adrenal gland cortex was identified. Based on the existing criteria the diagnosis of oncocytic adrenocortical carcinoma was made. Conclusion: Oncocytic adrenocortical carcinomas are quite rare neoplasms, with less than 20 cases reported in the literature. In most published cases, similar to our case, they are nonfunctional tumours, and complete surgical removal is the treatment of choice. Objective: Large parathyroid adenomas (LPTA) weighing >2 g show distinctive clinicopathological features compared to small adenomas. All consecutive parathyroid adenomas (PA) were evaluated for clinicopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) features with an aim to study the behavioural difference between small and large PA. Method: Clinical, biochemical and histological findings of 180 consecutive PAs in a 21 year period were reviewed. IHC was performed for parafibromin, APC, galectin-3 PGP9.5 and Ki67. All findings were compared between PAs of <2 and >2 g. Results: Ninety eight (54.5 %) adenomas were >2 g. Larger PAs showed significantly higher association with bony deformities including cystic lesions (p = 0.006), proximal muscle weakness (p = 0.009), hypercalcemia (p = 0.01), hypercalcemic crisis (p = 0.02) and elevated alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.001). No significant difference was noted in parathormone levels amongst the two groups. There was no significant association between weight and histological features. High expression of galectin-3 (p = 0.03) and PGP9.5 (p = 0.02) was seen in larger PAs (>2 g). Parafibromin, APC and Ki67 did not show any significant difference between two groups. Conclusion: More than half of parathyroid adenomas in Indians are larger than 2 g and qualify for LPTA. Despite having adverse clinical, biochemical and IHC features, they show benign histology.",

            "text": "Objective: Most sellar region masses are pituitary adenomas; however, this location is affected by a large number of pathologic entities. The aim of this work is to provide a practical, non-electron-microscopically based approach, for the daily practice of diagnosing and subclassifying adenomatous and non-adenomatous lesions of pituitary specimens. Method: Literature review and primary material from the Academic Medical Center in Lisbon (Santa Maria University Hospital). Results: The initial examination requires routine haematoxylin-eosin, to establish whether the lesion is a primary adenohypophysial proliferation or one of the many other types of pathology that occur in this area. After formulating a differential diagnosis, with a single mind map that easily illustrates the range of lesions present in the sellar region, the general pathologist can generate a confident final diagnosis with a few special stains and immunohistochemical markers that are now available to accurately classify these tumours. Conclusion: Adenomas and non-adenomatous masses can be easily diagnosed in a limited panel of stains and immunostains that can be used in daily practice at most centers. The complex and necessary subclassification of pituitary adenomas is now recognized to reflect specific clinical features and genetic alterations that predict targeted therapies for patients with pituitary disorders. Objective: Weiss criteria (WeC) have been proposed to distinguish between benign and malignant adrenocortical neoplasms(ACN). However, definitive criteria for malignancy are distant metastasis and/or local invasion. Our aim is to review the distribution of WeC and the clinical outcome of cases where the differential diagnosis of benignVSmalignant ACN was at stake. Method: We reviewed the slides and clinical files of 21 patients with ACN diagnosed at our institution (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) that showed a) \u22653WeC; b) <3WeC, but had concerning pathological features (weight \u2265 100 g and/ or size \u2265 6.5 cm) which prompted a closer follow-up of patients. Results: ACN with malignant behavior (n = 13) showed a median weight/size of 214 g/11.3 cm. Capsular invasion, nuclear grade III/IV and \u226425 % clear cells were the most frequently observed WeC on malignant neoplasms. Of the patients with \u22653WeC (n = 17), 13 (76 %) had a malignant behaviour (disease recurrence and/or metastases). Of the patients with \u22655WeC (n = 11), 7 (63 %) died of disease or its complications. All cases with <3WeC had a benign course, with patients showing no evidence of disease at present. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of ACN is challenging. Despite concerns about their subjectivity, WeC seem to be useful on predicting malignant behaviour especially in cases with high scores. Close followup of patients with borderline scores is important. Objective: To establish the relationship between biomarkers expression (ATRX, HES1, mTOR, NOTCH1, VEGFR2 and MGMT) with predictive significance and the biological behavior of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs). Method: A retrospective evaluation of the total samples diagnosed as GEP-NETs (period 2003 was conducted, clinical and pathological characteristics were evaluated in all cases. Biomarkers expression was assessed trough immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays <BR> Results: 143 cases of GEP-NET mainly from ileum/jejunum (23,8 %), appendix (19.6 %), colon/cecum/rectum (16,8 %) , pancreas (15,4 %) and stomach (14 %) were included. Average age was 55(11-83 years-old). Tumours were more frequent in males (61.5 %) and patients older than 18 years-old (93 %). Expression was positive in Hes1 (95.8 %), Notch 1 (91.6 %), ATRX (89.5 %), VEGFR2 (74.8 %) , PDGFR-\u03b2 (62.9 %), mTOR (39.9 %), and MGMT (23.8 %). VEGFR was more commonly expressed in jejunum/ileum (p: 0.00; OR: 0.24 IC95% 0.10-0.57), cecum/ colon/sigmoid (p:0.02; OR: 5.84; IC95%:1.06-31.98) and in grade 2 GEP-NETs (p = 0, 01). MGMT lost expression more commonly in appendix (p: 0.00; OR: 0.13 IC95% 0.02-0.76). Finally, a significant loss of expression of MTOR in colon/sigmoid/cecum (p: 0.03; OR: 0.34 IC95% 0.12-0.95) was identified Conclusion: Our results must conduct to new studies focused on strict follow up of specific alternative therapies (alkylating agents, oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy, growth factor and protein kinase inhibitors) and biomarkers expression to evaluate a possible improve in survival rates of this patients <BR> Objective: Lymphoepithelial cysts of the thyroid (\"branchial cleft-like cyst\") are very rare lesions which may arise from intrathyroidal remnants of branchial derivatives, frequently associated with Hashimoto or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. They may coexist with thyroid carcinoma, but are not related pathogenetically. Method: We present two cases of a 66 respectively 41-year-old woman with a cyst located on the left lobe of thyroid gland and isthmus region, diagnosed in the Pathology Department \"St.Spiridon\" University Hospital with histopathological examination and immunohistochemically analysis. Results: Each cyst was lined by a stratified squamous epithelium associated with an abundant lymphoid tissue with reactive germinal centers. Benign lymphoepithelial lesions can be mistaken with Warthin-like tumours because of the presence of oncocytic metaplasia. Immunohistochemically, squamous epithelium was positive for CK19 and CK5, but negative for HBME1 and CD56. Oncocytic metaplasia was positive for CK19, HBME1, CD56 and negative for CK5. In both cases the thyroid parenchyma shows Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multifocal conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (0.1-1.5 cm). Conclusion: Lymphoepithelial cysts of the thyroid are very rare, their association with carcinoma is occasional and the immunohistochemically analysis may be useful for differentiating from Warthin-like tumours. Objective: Endocrine pathologies can cause wide scope of symptoms and objective changes, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening acute course. Although amyloid goiter is usually symptomless, in advanced stage the rapid thyroid enlargement can suggest an aggressive carcinoma, thymoma or lymphoma. Our objective is to report an advanced, lifethreatening amyloid goiter associated with initial carcinogenesis. Method: Patient's medical history, clinical and laboratory investigations, as well as the treatment and surgical pathology data were retrospectively reviewed.",

            "text": "Results: A 65-year-old woman underwent emergency hospitalisation because of dyspnoea and dysphagia. Blood tests were within laboratory reference ranges. Computed tomography showed a large retrosternal pathological mass that compressed trachea for 80 %, oesophagus, brachiocephalic veins. Total thyroidectomy was performed. Grossly, right lobe measured 11.5 \u00d7 10.5 \u00d7 6 cm, left-10 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 5 cm; both lobes were multinodular. By microscopy, the whole gland was composed of atrophic follicles surrounded by fat cells and eosinophilic homogenous deposits exhibiting positive reaction with Congo red and apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Papillary microcarcinoma measuring 0.4 cm was discovered in the right lobe. The postoperative period was uneventful. Conclusion: Amyloid goiter can initially be clinically silent while causing life-threatening situations in advanced stage. Although follicles are atrophic, carcinogenesis can be induced as confirmed by the incidentally found papillary microcarcinoma in the present case. Objective: Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumours arising from the extra-adrenal autonomic paraganglia. They have been described at any site where autonomic ganglia were found. This report describes six cases of paraganglioma occurring in various locations. Method: All patients were women with a mean age of 44 years-old. They were presenting in two cases with a carotid body tumour, in two cases with an abdominal mass associated in one case to spells of headache, palpitations and flushing, in one case with intra-peritoneal mass and the last one, the patient presented with catecholamine-secreting symptoms associated to paraganglioma. Results: Histologic examination revealed in four cases an encapsulated benign neoplasm composed of characteristic clusters of epithelioid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in a nested pattern and peripherally surrounded by some spindle-shaped cells. These features are typical of paraganglioma. In the other case, characteristic paraganglioma have been diagnosed in association to a benign nerve tumour composed of Schwann cells. In the last case, capsule and vascular invasion were noted. Objective: Primary leimyosarcoma of the adrenal gland (PLA) is an extremely rare mesenchymal adrenal tumour with only 30 documented cases available in the literature. PLA is believed to originate from the smooth muscle walls of the adrenal vena branches. A case of PLA is described. Method: A 69 years-old Caucasian female, presented with a 6 months history of pain in the right flank. Radiological investigation detected an heterogeneously mass with a maximum diameter of 8 cm, located in the right adrenal area. No other neoplastic mass was revealed. The patient underwent transperitoneal right adrenalectomy. Surgery detected widespread adrenal and vena cava invasion. Postoperative recover was uneventful. Local adjuvant rathiotherapy was planned. Results: Histologically, a mesenchymal tumour of spindle shaped cells, in close vicinity to the adrenal parenchyma, was revealed. Tumour cells with moderate nuclear pleomorphism and occasional bizarre features had abundant intracytoplasmic glycogen. A mitotic activity of 7-8 mitoses /10hpf and areas of necrosis were demonstrated. Neoplasm was immunoreactive for SMA, vimentin, desmin, HHF35, h-caldesmon, an immunophenotype compatible with leimyosarcoma. Conclusion: In view of the rarity of this tumour and the absence of any hormonal derangement or imaging characteristics, the diagnosis is based entirely on histological and immunohistochemical evaluation. Objective: Graves' disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroidism caused by excessive thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persists mainly in human B lymphocytes. We have reported that TRAb-predisposed EBV-infected cells (TRAb(+)EBV(+) cells) could produce TRAb in response to EBV-reactivation in both patients and controls. In this study, we compared the amount of total immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM produced during EBV-reactivation induction between patients and controls. Method: We separated PBMCs of 9 Graves' disease patients and 9 controls, and cultured for 2 days. The cultured PBMCs were then transferred to 33\u00b0C to reactivate persistent EBV. We collected culture medium and measured Ig concentration by ELISA at day 0, 5, 10, 12. At the same time, we confirmed AID-mRNA expression of culture cells. Results: We observed biphasic production of IgG and IgM in day 0 and day 10, 12. The increase in day 0 may be influenced by pre-culture; thus, the rise in day 10, 12 would be production induced by EBV reactivation. Conclusion: In our previous data, EBV-induced TRAb production in Graves' disease patients was higher than that of controls. However, in this study, total Ig secretion was not different between patients and controls, suggesting the polyclonal B cell activation. Objective: Nasal polyposis is one of the common and disturbing diseases in otolaryngology. Few researches were done about sex steroid receptors in nasal polyps till yet. In this study, the difference between estrogen and progesterone receptors (ERs & PR) expression in nasal polyps due to gender, has been investigated. Method: In this cross-sectional study, 90 samples of nasal polyps were studied after polypectomy in Mostafa Khomeini Hospital-Tehran Iran, during 2007 to 2011. Information about sex and age of patients detected from their medical documents. Three slides were prepared from every paraffin embedded block by 3 \u03bcm cuts. One slide with Hematoxylineosin and 2 others by Immunohistochemistry were stained, and percentage of ERs and PR-positive cells determined in the epithelium using monoclonal antibody, via light microscopy. Results: In this research, 36.6 % of samples belong to women and 63.3 % belong to men. There was no significant correlation between ERs & PR expression with age. A significant correlation was seen between ERs and sex (p = 0.001), while no significant association found between PR and sex. Conclusion: As regards the incidence of ERs in females are significantly more than males; it can be used as an effective factor in pathogenesis for treatment of polyps. Results: Histological examination with haematoxylin and eosin stain disclosed samples of normal adenohypophysis and a small spindle cell tumour. At immunohistochemistry, the latter was negative for pituitary hormones, cytokeratins, GFAP and chromogranin and positive for S100, vimentin and TTF-1. Staining for EMA was observed focally. Proliferation index evaluated with Ki67 immunohistochemistry was 1 %. Histological and Immunohistochemical findings were consistent with pituicytoma. Conclusion: Association of ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease and pituicytoma represents a rare event. Only four cases were previously described in the English literature: in two male and in two female patients, one of whom was 7-year old child. The relationship between these diseases has not been explained; however it may likely depend upon their origin from a common progenitor cell. Objective: Up to 95 % of insulinomas are benign neuroendocrine neoplasias without evidence neither of metastases nor recurrence. The absence of metastatic potential is determined by low proliferative index and intracellular contacts condition. Method: The study based on the surgical pathology material obtained from 23 patients with sporadic pancreatic insulinoma (NET). 21 tumour ware grade 1 (pT1) and only 2 tumours-grade 2 (pT2) (WHO, 2010) . Diagnosis of insulinoma was confirmed by IHC. All cases were undergone to EM (G1-21 cases and G2-2 cases) (JEOL JEM 100-CX). Results: There were two types of B-cells: 1-with large clear nuclei; 2with dark nuclei. We noticed the dissolution of cell membranes on the majority of inter-cell borders longitude. The cells were connected by means of desmosomes. After dissolving of the cellular membranes secretory granules were seen to migrate from one cell to another. There was no evidence of destructive any other cell structure. Dark cells had predominantly hormone-secreting function and between contacts dark cells more frequently demonstrated their membrane preservation. Dissolution of dark cell membrane caused the transfer of the granules in to clear cells. Neuroendocrine cells lacked the ability for invade intracellular matrix, so they excreted granules in the adjusted cells. Conclusion: Electron microscopy revealed no evidence of malignancy in cases of cell membrane dissolution with desmosomes saving. That phenomena reflects high cell activity secreting the granules in the intracellular space a s well in the adjusted cells. Objective: Parathyroid carcinoma is the rare malignant disease of endocrine tumour. The incidence is less than 1 % of all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in Western countries. Method: Two patients with a diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma in Khon Kaen hospital were included for this review. Results: The first case was a 24-year-old woman who had a midline neck mass for 4 months. Her blood calcium was 18.7 mg/dL. On examination, she has a firm midline neck mass is about 4 cm in diameter and movable. The total thyroidectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was parathyroid carcinoma. After that, she was loss follow up. The second case report was a 53 years old lady present to the hospital complaining fatigue and midline neck mass. The investigation revealed severe hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. Surgical exploration revealed an enlarged left parathyroid mass, 2.5 cm. Histological findings and immunohistochemical report confirmed as parathyroid carcinoma. Conclusion: Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare endocrine malignant tumour. Furthermore, the diagnostic criteria have always been a challenge for pathologists. It's very important to carefully evaluate this lesion on histological diagnosis and also require the clinical data for correlation. In complicated cases, the suggestion from expert endocrine pathologists is needed. Objective: Although C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) is frequently observed in thyroids of patients with hereditary and sporadic medullary carcinomas(MC), it has also been observed in other neoplastic and nonneoplastic conditions. The study aimed to clarify the type and frequency of CCH in different thyroid lesions. Method: Thyroid tissue samples in distance >1 cm from nodule (18 cases of MC: 3 hereditary, 15 sporadic; 20 cases of papillary carcinomas; 20 cases of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) were analyzed. C-cells were identificated by immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin. The criterion of CCH was >50 cells per (x100) field. Results: We revealed reactive CCH in 7(39 %) thyroids with MC, 2(10 %) with papillary carcinoma, 4(20 %) with thyroiditis. CCH was focal in 9(69 %), diffuse and nodular in 4(31 %): in 2 cases of MC, in 2 cases of thyroiditis. Neoplastic bilateral CCH in 3 cases of MC was found, and groups of C-cells estimated as intrathyroidal spread of MC in 4 cases. C-cells showed different sizes and form, mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and cytoplasm parameters widely varied. In 5(38 %) cases of CCH fibrotic response to cells was noted.",

Method: A total thyroidectomy specimen and the right inferior parathyroid adenoma (PA) of a 31-year-old male was submitted to the pathology department of Tirgu-Mures county hospital, with the diagnosis of nodular goiter and PA. Results: Macroscopically, two whitish nodules of 3 and 4 mm, simetrically situated in superior-part of right and left lobes were found. Microscopically, the nodules were well-defined and composed of nests of spindle or globular cells, with finely granular abundant cytoplasm, with spindle-cells arranged in swirls, separated by fine bands of fibrosis. Immunohitochemically, they expressed calcitonin and chromogranin but no thyroglobulin. Secondary foci of medularry thyroid microcarcinoma (MTMC) and neoplastic C-cell hyperplasia were noticed in both lobes. The PA had an usual microscopical-appearance. Suspicion of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) was raised. Reviewing the medical history, we found that 6 years before, the patient had undergone bilateral adrenalectomy for bilateral pheocromocytoma and consecutively a MEN2A syndrome was genetically confirmed. Conclusion: Given the small size of tumours, in the absence of correct clinical information, the pathological examination could miss the presence of MTMC, with impact on clinical management of the patient.",

Lansdown * Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Histopathology, United Kingdom Objective: Parathyroid carcinoma is an extremely rare, and poorly understood endocrine malignancy, and causes an estimated 0.005 % of all human cancers and about 1 % of primary hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging and definitive diagnosis can only be made with specialised histological techniques. Due to its low incidence, there is a lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. The identification and management of these cases have been especially challenging to clinicians. Method: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent parathyroid surgery (primary and renal hyperparathyroidism) in a tertiary center between January 2011 and December 2015 for complex parathyroid tumours (atypical adenomas, hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma). Results: 219 parathyroidectomies were carried out during this period, of which 11 (5 %) were complex parathyroid tumours, with a subdivision of 4 parathyroid carcinomas, 6 atypical adenomas and 1 atypical hyperplasia. Mean age was 49.9, F>M, 9 sporadic and 2 familial. Mean serum ca 3.2 mmol/l and mean PTH 75.8 pmol/l. 9 had Vit D deficiency. Frozen section was used in half of the cases. All parathyroid carcinoma cases had bilateral neck exploration.5 patients had ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy. 1 patient developed multiple neck and lung metastases with several repeat surgeries.",

High suspicion preoperatively in patients with marked elevated serum calcium and PTH could guide surgery extent. Patient with parathyroid carcinomas and atypical adenomas should be offered a long term follow-up for early detection of recurrences. Objective: Nesidioblastosis is a rare condition characterized by hyperplasia and hypertrophy of pancreatic islet cells and presence of islets in intimate association with ducts. Mediastinal teratoma with pancreatic tissue is also rare. Herein, we report a case of nesidioblastosis and pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia in a mediastinal mature teratoma in an adult. Method: 32-year-old male presented with chest discomfort and revealed to have a large mass in his anterior mediastinum. The patient underwent an excision of the mass with a clinical diagnosis of mediastinal teratoma. Histologic examination including hematoxylin-eosin stain and immunohistochemical stains were performed. Results: Histologically, the mass showed large areas of mature pancreatic tissue with various elements including intestine, squamous epithelium, skin appendages, respiratory epithelium, bone, cartilage, and fat which were supporting the diagnosis of a mature teratoma. In the area of pancreatic tissue, diffuse and non-mass forming hyperplasia of pancreatic islet cells was observed. Ductulo-insular complexes were also frequently noted. The hyperplastic cells were positive for neuroendocrine markers in immunohistochemical stains. Conclusion: We report a very rare case of nesidioblastosis and pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia arising in a mediastinal teratoma. The patient has stayed healthy without any endocrine symptom during 10 months after surgery. Objective: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) showing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) differentiation is rare, and may appear in metastatic site rather than the primary site. We reviewed the clinical and histological features of this rare occurrence. Method: The histological findings of a transformation of a metastatic PTC into SCC are described with a review of the related literature. Results: A 84-year-old female, presented with a 4-year history of an enlarging right-sided neck mass. Cervical ultrasonography followed by computed tomography (CT) revealed a 6 cm cm solido-cystic mass, associated with two thyroid nodules. A fine needle aspiration of this mass suggested a SCC. Clinical examination, panendoscopy, CT scan and nasopharyngeal biopsy didn't reveal any possible primary site for this SCC. Histopathological examination of the total thyroidectomy specimen revealed a multifocal classic PTC with bilateral lymph node metastasis. The resected mass showed a biphasic tumour comprising area of PTC merging with moderately differentiated SCC. Four months later, she developed SCC recurrence in the neck's soft tissue. After surgery, the patient was referred for external beam radiotherapy. Conclusion: Transformation of differentiated thyroid cancer into SCC is rare and was puzzling in our case. Such a transformation usually confers a poor prognosis.",

            "text": "E-PS-05-032 Macrofollicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: A rare but \"tricky\" papillary carcinomas subtype C. Cacchi * , A. Heinzel, R. Kn\u00fcchel-Clarke * RWTH-Aachen, Pathology, Germany Objective: We want describe a case of this extremely rare variant, focusing about the differential diagnosis. Method: Having a \"cold\" nodule in Hystmus and goiter condition, a 52 years old patient was referred to surgery. Macroscopically a relatively well demarcated colloidal 3.8 cm nodule has been observed. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples of this thyroid colloidal nodule have been examined in the HE routine stain. To support the final diagnosis an Immunostain with HBME-1 was also performed. Results: Microscopically the tumour, capsulated, was characterized by the large size of its follicles. They represented the great majority of the lesion. The thyreocytes showed larger nuclei, sometimes irregularly spaced, clear chromatin and \"grooves\". Some follicles were lined by cells with on slight enlarged nuclei with dark chromatin. Focally small, abortive papillae have been noted. To confirm the suspicion of a macrofollicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (MFVPTC) the tumour cells exhibit a membrane-apical reaction for HBME-1. Conclusion: It is important to identify this subtype because in the routine it can be easily underdiagnosed as hyperplastic nodule or follicular adenoma. To avoid a misdiagnosis careful search for cytological atypia is important: lymph node and distal metastasis are present respectively in 20 and 6 % of cases. Objective: To report an exceedingly rare case of ectopic intrathyroidal thymoma. Method: Tumour samples were colored with HE and a large panel of antibodies were used. Results: A 62-year-old tunisian woman presented with multinodular thyroid gland. The right lobe included an encapsulated, firm nodule of 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm. In the other lobe were two nodules of 0,8 and 2,5 cm. Microscopic examination of the right lobe showed a highly cellular tumour with sclerotic bands forming incompletely demarcated nodules. The tumour was made of monotonous spindle cells within a lymphoid stroma. Immunohistochemically, cells was intensely positif for cytokeratin and Pax8 but not for TTF1, Thyroglobulin, calcitonin, CD5 and CD117. Ectopic normal thymic tissue was found at the periphery of the tumour. Residual thyroid tissue was absent. This immunohistochemical profile and the biphasic histologic pattern were considered characteristic of a type AB thymoma. The samllest left nodule matched with a nonencapsulated papillary microcarcinoma. Conclusion: Intrathyroidal thymoma is rare especially in old adults. It seems to arise in ectopic intrathyroid thymus. Proper diagnosis requires appropriate histopathologic assessment and staining, which in turn requires an awareness of a clinical index of suspicion for this condition. Objective: Gastrointestinal tract is the most common extranodal site involved by lymphoma, representing about 5-20 % of all cases. Histopathologically, roughly 90 % of the primary gastrointestinal lymphomas are of B cell lineage with very few T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. However, primary gastrointestinal lymphoma is extremely rare, accounting for only 1-4 % of all gastrointestinal malignancies with DLBCL (Diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma) and MALT (Lymphomas of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue)being the most common entities, while mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) accounts for less than 1 %. Method: We report the case of a 74-year-old male presenting with a 5month history of abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Gross examination of the specimen revealed two gastric masses: a 10/8/ 2 cm smaller mass with a crater-like ulcerating area of 3/1/0.5 cm located in the fundus and a 14/12/3 cm larger mass located near the antrum. Invasion was found in 18 out of the 22 examined lymph nodes (from both greater and lesser curvature of the stomach). Objective: Here we present a case of a hepatic flexure colon tumour of 61-year-old woman with no history of lung tumour. Method: Immunohistochemistry was applied and 50 genes were analyzed by next generation sequencing technology (NGS). Results: An ulcerated, 5 cm-in-diameter tumour invaded the entire thickness of colon. The cancer contained medium to large size neoplastic cells with evident nucleoli with some focal features of adenocarcinoma that constituted less than 30 % too little to designate the tumour as mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC). It was diagnosed poorly differentiated neuroendocrine predominantly large cell carcinoma of colon (\"unfortunate\" (according to Odze & Goldblum) category G3: WHO 2010) (pT3 N0: 7th edition pTNM). CK1AE/AE3 staining was predominantly membranous with partial distribution in dot-like pattern in perinecrotic cancer fields to be reminiscent of small cell carcinoma of lung counterpart. Ki67 labeled over 90 % of cancer cells with partial positive nuclear staining for TTF1. To our surprise no lymph nodal metastases were revealed in H&E staining as well as lymph nodes didn't show keratin positive deposits of cancer cells in labeling with CK1AE/ AE3. We detected nonsense mutations in four tumour suppressor genes (APC R1114X (molecular evidence that the cancer was a primary tumour of colon), TP53 R113X, RB1 E137X and FBWX7 R393X & S282X) and mutations in three receptor tyrosine kinases (RET A919V of high transforming activity, EGFR E114K and FLT3 L601I). Conclusion: Gene profiling of this rare carcinoma confirmed its primary colon origin in differential diagnosis to be helpful in choice of postsurgical treatment therapy option. Objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is observed in 5.5-13.5 % of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and in 0.4-0.8 % of patients with Crohn disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between COX-2 and FasL expression in colon mucosa of patients with CRC, UC and CD in order to assess its value for prognosis of CRC. Method: Expression of COX-2 and FasL was analyzed immunohistochemically in the samples of colon mucosa taken from the affected areas of 10 CRC patients CRC, 4 UC patients, 6 CD patients with CD and from unaffected areas of 7 CRC patients. Results: Average expression of FasL in both unaffected and affected areas of CRC patients was higher than in CD patients. Average expression of FasL in affected areas of CRC patients was higher than in UC patients and the same as in unaffected areas. Multiple linear regression analysis has shown that FasL expression together with the duration of anti-COX-2 treatment was among the strongest predictors of COX-2 expression. Conclusion: The revealed strong relationship between COX-2 and FasL expression in CRC, CD and UC patients supports the possibility to use expression of FasL as a prognostic marker of efficacy of anti-COX-2 treatment and probability of tumourogenesis. Objective: To test the hypothesis that non-syndromic intestinal lipomas might represent a sporadic counterpart of lipomatous tumours occurring in PDGFRA-mutant syndrome.",

            "text": "Method: A series of 20 intestinal lipomas were obtained from 17 patients and mutational analysis of exons 12, 14 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene (accession number D50017) was performed using PCR and direct sequencing. Results: M/F ratio was 8/9, age of the patients ranged from 45 to 84 years (average: 64.7). One patient presented with 3 lipomas, another one with 2 lipomas, 15 patients each had only 1 lipoma detected. DNA of 4 tumours was non-analyzable, all remaining 16 tumours were found to bear wildtype alleles of exons 12, 14 and 18 of PDGFRA gene. Conclusion: PDGFRA-mutant syndrome is a genetically defined subtype of Familial GIST syndrome. Although PDGFRA-mutated GISTs, Vanek's tumours and fibrous tumours are known to occur also in nonsyndromic sporadic setting, sporadic PDGFRA-mutated lipomas have not been recorded yet. Our first study didn't show PDGFRA mutations in any of the 16 analyzable tumours. Thus, PDGFRA mutations probably do not play an important role in the development of sporadic lipomas of the intestines. Objective: To evaluate the possible role of immunohistochemical detection of phoshorylated ribosomal protein S6 (PS6) in the differential diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its benign mimics in small endoscopical biopsies. Method: We collected a series of 30 specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 5 specimens of esophageal granular cell tumours (GCT), and 6 specimens of esophageal squamous cell papillomas (SCP). The histological diagnosis was correlated with abnormal staining of PS6 (at least 5 contiguous basal cells in the superficial epithelium) and with abnormal staining of p53. Results: 29 (96.7 %) cases of SCC showed pathological expression of PS6. All cases of SCC showed abnormal expression of p53. 2 (40 %) cases of GCT were PS6 positive, 3 (60 %) showed overexpression of p53, but only 1 tumour showed abnormal staining for both markers. 2 (33.3 %) cases of SCP were PS6 positive, 3 (50 %) showed at least focal overexpression of p53, 2 of these showing abnormal staining for both markers. Conclusion: Although this first preliminary study of esophageal squamous cell lesions suffers from a small number of cases, the results seem to support the thesis that adding immunohistochemical investigation of PS6 may increase accuracy of differential diagnostics of squamous cell proliferations of the esophagus. Objective: The objective of this study was to study the expression of WT1 in neurogen appendix and the relationships to Bcl2 protein.",

            "text": "Neurogen appendix (NAP) is relatively frequently encountered in adults and is supposed to interfere with motility and fecal stagnation. The S100protein is consistently expressed in such lesions. Recently, WT1 expression has been reported in peripheral nerves and neuromas. Method: WT1 and Bcl2 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in 18 NAP previously confirmed by S100 positivity. The expression was evaluated as negative, focal (<50 % stained cells) and diffuse (\u226550 %). The Kendall rank correlation test was used for statistical analysis. Results: The gender ratio was 11/7 (man/woman) and the age range 21-79 years. 15 NAP associated to acute appendicitis and 3 associated to subacute appendicitis. WT1 was expressed focally in 6 and diffusely in 11 NAP. WT1 expression correlated to increased age and male gender (p = 0.06/tau = 0.333 and, p = 0.09/tau = 0.299, respectively) . Focal Bcl2 expression was seen in 5/11 WT1-positive NAP. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that WT1 was expressed in almost all cases of NAP, suggesting a potential use as neurogen marker. WT1-positive NAP were more frequently associated to acute than to subacute appendicitis. The co-expression of Bcl2 suggests a possible interference with programmed cell death/apoptosis/necroptosis. Objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common worldwide cancer. it is the fourth most common worldwide overall cause of cancer death. Autophagy has been highlighted as a promising molecular target in cancer. Detecting LC3 has become a reliable method for monitoring autophagy and autophagy-related processes, including autophagic cell death. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Method: Twenty five CRC and 25 normal mucosa specimens were obtained. Immunohistochemical assessment of LC3 expression and assessment of STAT3 and microRNA 101 expressions by real time-PCR were done. Results: Revealed a statistically significant increase in LC3 (p < 0.001) and STAT3 expression in tumour samples (mean \u00b1 SD = 6.31 \u00b1 1.96 folds) than normal mucosa (p < 0.001). Both of them were directly correlated together (r = 0.833, p < 0.001). MicroRNA 101 was inversely correlated to both LC3 and STAT3 (p < 0.001) and was significantly reduced in tumour samples (mean \u00b1 SD = 0.37 \u00b1 0.16 folds) (p < 0.001) with a possible correlations to tumour grade (p = 0.006), pathological stage (p = 0.009) lymph node involvement (p = 0.017) and advanced clinical stage (p = 0.011). Conclusion: LC3, STAT3 and miRNA 101 may be valuable as biomarkers that may predict the poor prognosis of a cancer colon patient and the critical role of STAT3 and miRNAs in autophagy would expand our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of autophagy regulation.",

            "text": "Objective: To study the varied clinical presentations of Eosinophilic gastroenteritis, a relatively rare inflammatory disease of unknown origin. Method: We retrospectively reviewed nine cases of Eosinophilic gastroenteritis diagnosed in our institution over a period of 2 years with correlation to radiological, endoscopic and histological features. Representative images will be presented. Results: Amongst the 9 cases, one presented with small bowel obstruction, one with diarrhoea, one with dyspepsia and six with abdominal pain. Eight cases were diagnosed on duodenal biopsies and once case on full thickness ileal biopsy. All the cases responded to steroids and no relapses were seen in any of the cases till date. CT scan was performed in six of the nine cases, four of which did not show any significant findings, one showed mild jejunal thickening and one showed features compatible sub-acute intestinal obstruction. Peripheral eosinophilia was noted only in two of the nine cases. Conclusion: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained abdominal pain. Correlation with high peripheral eosinophilic counts is helpful though not necessary in all cases. Timely treatment with steroids is curative. Objective: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, an uncommon form of chronic cholecystitis, is considered to have an uncertain pathogenesis. It has been proposed that this condition appears due to rupture of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, with extravasation of bile or ulceration of gallbladder mucosa. Both of these conditions can easily be mistaken for malignancy, both clinically and histopathologically. Therefore, the presence of both lesions makes for a challenging diagnosis and it requires additional testing to exclude other conditions. Method: We report the case of a 40-year old woman who was clinically diagnosed with a pancreatic tumour and a cholecystectomy was performed. Results: We received one paraffin block requiring a consult. Microscopically, the gallbladder wall showed numerous round lipidladen macrophages and other types of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes) . Adjacent to the liver bed, less than 1 mm in diameter, small ducts were found surrounded by a collar of connective tissue. Differential diagnosis considered a malignant process, so immunohistochemistry assays were performed and they showed an intense positive reaction for CK7, S100, SMA, a low Ki67 index and a negative reaction for MUC1. Conclusion: The purpose of this report is to outline the great difficulty that comes from differentiating benign from malignant processes and the importance of additional testing when confronted with a rare diagnosis. Cholelithiasis is well-established predisposing factor for the development of GB carcinoma.It is characterized by extracellular mucin comprising 50 % of the tumour volume. Tumours with less than 50 % stromal mucin were considered as adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation.",

            "text": "When the mucinous component exceeds 90 %, the tumour is classified as pure mucinous/colloid carcinoma. We present a case of primary carcinoma of the GB as an unexpected histopathological finding in an elective cholecystectomy specimen. Method: A 67-year-old female underwent simple cholecystectomy because of cholelithiasis in our surgical clinic. There was a nodular mass measuring 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2.5 cm in the corpus. The cut surface of the mass was tan to yellow, shiny, solid and firm. Results: Suprisingly,sections from the mass revealed a tumour composed of tumour cells floating in the pools of extracellular mucin,a signetringlike cells can be seen in clusters or lying individually within the mucin. The tumour was seen to infiltrate into the muscle layer. Displasia, intestinal metaplasia and calcification were also found. A diagnosis of incidental MAGB was made. Conclusion: MAGB exhibit important clinicopathologic differences from conventional GB carcinomas. Therefore a routine histopathological examination of all cholecystectomy specimens is a necessity. Histological type,grade and stage of the disease are the predictors of prognosis. Objective: Colon carcinoma, as one of the most common cancers, has been investigated for genetic alterations. Besides wellknown adenomacarcinoma sequence, it is recently found that BRAF mutation has an important role particularly in early stages of adenocarcinomas with serrated features. To the best of our knowledge, there isn't any study concerning BRAF mutational status of serrated polyps in Turkish population. In this study, we aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression profile of BRAF in colon polyps. Method: 49 sessile serrated and traditional adenomas, 10 hyperplastic polyps, 10 tubular adenomas, 10 aberrant crypt foci and 10 cases of normal controls were immunohistochemically evaluated for the presence of BRAF mutation with VE1 antibody. Results were statistically compared. Results: There was positive staining with VE1 antibody in 55.1 % of serrated adenoma cases, although 80 % of control groups and 70 % of aberran crypt foci were negative. Despite the hyperplastic polyps are regarded as members of the serrated polyp family, 90 % of these lesions showed no antibody expression. Conclusion: Our study results, in concordance with the recent literature suggest that serrated adenomas have BRAF mutation which may contribute in their malignant behavior. Objective: CD47 is a transmembrane receptor in the immunoglobulin superfamily. It interacts with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) on the membrane of macrophage and neutrophils. There are some researches that CD47-SIRP\u03b1 pathway worked as antiphagocytic \"don't eat me\" signal, and when the tumour expressed CD47 higher level, it could get ability to escape the innate immune system. The aim of this study is evaluation of CD47 expression in gastric cancer using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mRNA in situ hybridization (mRNA ISH). Method: This study performed analysis of CD47 RNA expression status with RNAscope in a cohort of 55 surgically resected primary gastric cancers, using tissue microarray. RNAscope results were reported by manufacturer's scoring system. Protein expression was evaluated using commercial CD47 antibodies. Results: The proportion of cases with strong membranous expression in CD47 IHC was 1.8 % (1 out of 55). The proportion of cases with high cytoplasmic expression in CD47 IHC was 63.6 % (35 out of 55). Cytoplasm CD47 positive cases have tendency of poorly differentiated histology, lower lymph node metastasis, lower invasion, higher lymphoid stroma, lower tumour stage, microsatellite instable and better prognosis. Conclusion: We suggest that CD47 protein has some roles in gastric carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Objective: Histogenesis and progression of carcinosarcoma are still unknown. We report a case of carcinosarcoma of the stomach, with attention to its clonality, distribution of immunophenotypes and relationship between original and metastatic lesions. Method: [Case report] A 72-year-old woman with a history of appetite loss, anemia and weight loss, was admitted to our hospital. The patient underwent an esophagogastro-duodenoscopy that revealed a red-colored huge mass (13 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 6 cm) with erosion in the antral region of the stomach, and a distal gastrectomy sequentially. The metastatic tumour was detected in one regional lymph node. Results: Histologcal findings: The largest cross section was examined. The tumour, composed of 5 % carcinomatous and 95 % sarcomatous elements, were diffusely positive for p53 with a point mutation of TP53. The carcinomatous elements consisted mainly of well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that was focally positive for HER2/neu and CD10, and partly of squamous cell carcinoma that was positive for p40 and/or p63. The sarcomatous elements, consisted mainly of spindle-shaped cells and partly of large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, were largely positive for CD10 and partly positive for cytokeratin(AE1/AE3), desmin and myogenin. Regarding lymph node metastasis, the tumour also consisted of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements, diffusely positive for p53 and CD10. Conclusion: Diffusely positive finding of p53 with a point mutation of TP53 indicates that this tumour is monoclonal, and CD10 expression may be related to lymph node metastasis in this case. Focal overexpression of HER2/neu suggests that HER2 alteration is a late event during progression of this tumour. Results: Of the studied cases ECS was appeared in 66 % of women and 34 % men. Most of all were high-grade adenocarcinoma-81 %, 19 %low-grade adenocarcinoma and Signet ring cell carcinoma. In 90 % of all cases the tumour does not grow into the submucosa (pT1a by TNM) and there were no cancerous emboli in the vessels. In 80 % of all cases ECS existed on the background of colonic metaplasia, in 86 % of all cases had dysplasia of varying severity. Genetic research revealed that 10 % of ECS detected KRAS p.G13D mutation (male, high-grade adenocarcinoma, pT1a). 100 % ECS was not detected BRAF mutations. Conclusion: Thus, ECS prevailed frequency in women (66 %), and histological type-high-grade adenocarcinoma (81 %) without germination stomach submucosa (90 %). In most cases, ECS occurred colonic metaplasia (80 %) and dysplasia (86 %). In 10 % of cases detected KRAS mutation, 100 % ECS was not detected BRAF mutations. Objective: Report of two cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) arising in a background of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) both associated with well-differentiated morphology and serrated-like lesions in surrounding mucosa is presented.",

            "text": "Method: Patient 1 (female, 44 years old) with ulcerative colitis for 15 years and was admitted for elective surgery for DALM lesions and colon ascendens stenosis. Patient 2 (female, 29 years old) presented with ileus and was diagnosed with IBD with concurrent stenosis of lienal flexure. Results: Patient 1: Resection specimen showed signs of ulcerative colitis with partial mucosal remission. Infiltration of colon ascendens with well differentiated adenocarcinoma was seen up to subserosal adipose tissue. Surrounding and distant mucosa showed several inflammatory pseudopolypous as well as serrated lesions. Patient 2: Resection specimen showed signs of Crohns disease, reported stenosis was due to well differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma with partial mucinous differentiation infiltrating bowel wall to subserosa. Several foci of mucosal hyperplasia with serrated morphology was seen. There was no loss in immunohistochemical expression of mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) and BRAF V600E staining was negative in both cases. Conclusion: Patients with IBD has increased risk of CRC with precursor adenomatous DALM lesions. We are reporting two carcinomas showing bland and well differentiated morphology and serrated lesions. These two cases are pointing to an importance of reporting serrated lesions in IBD patients regarding their possible association to CRC via serrated pathway. Objective: Phlebosclerotic colitis is a fibrous degeneration ultimately leading to threadlike calcifications along colonic and mesenteric vessels and colonic wall thickening. Resulting mucosal ulceration causes expected symptoms of ischemic colitis: fever, abdominal pain, severe constipation, bowel obstruction, vomiting, diarrhea. Presentation of a 63 year old Caucasian woman: 1997 cervical carcinoma with radiation proctitis. No known intestinal disease. 2015 emergency hospitalization (rupture of an aneurysm of the pericallosal artery, ventricular hemorrhage). Four weeks into hospitalization, colon resection was performed due to rectal perforation and peritonitis. Method: CT scan, MRI, pathologic evaluation including immunohistochemistry. Results: No calcification was found by CT/ MRI. Gross Pathology of the resected colonic frame revealed confluent mucosal damage, and beginning transmural necroses reaching from the ascending colon to the rectum with perforation. Microscopy showed extensive and circumferential calcifications of the walls of medium sized, submucosal veins, not involving arteries or veins in the subserosal fat. No signs of viral, bacterial or fungal infection. Conclusion: This represents an unusual differential diagnosis of an ischemic colitis. Diagnosis was hampered by the unconsciousness due to the aneurysmal bleed. Colonic vascular calcifications suggest a socalled phlebosclerotic colitis, while histology shows unique features different from cases reported so far from Asia and Canada. Objective: We aimed to report the characteristics of lithiasis in septate gallbladder (SGB) occurring in adults. Septate gallbladder is a rare congenital abnormality defined by the presence of intercommunicating locules that may impact on bile streaming and stagnation. Method: A total of 62 surgically resected SGBs were analyzed for the main clinical and morphological features of the resected specimens. Relationships were analyzed by using the Kendall rank correlation test (Medcalc). Results: and, was supracentimetric (>1 cm) in 18 (34 %) cases. The gallbladder length varied between 3.5 and 12.7 cm. A body mass index (BMI) >25 was observed in 10 cases (8 cases: BMI >30). The presence of supracentimetric lithiasis correlated an increased gallbladder length and to BMI > 30 (p = 0.02/tau = 0.214 and p = 0.03/tau = 0.201, respectively). Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that supracentimetric lithiasis occurred in one third of the SGBs. The biological background of the correlation between an increased gallbladder length or obesity and supracentimetric lithiasis remains to be further studied. Results: Microscopic examination of the polyp revealed a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with prominent clear cell change, which was invading the submucosa to Haggett's level 3. The tumour was positive for CDX2, focally positive for CK20 and negative for CK7. Alcian blue, PAS and PASD were negative. Two months later the patient underwent a sigmoid colectomy. A second polyp was found to be a tubulovillous adenoma with areas of clear cell change. There was no residual adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Clear cell adenocarcinoma in the colon is usually a metastatic deposit from other organs. Most of the reported cases of primary colonic clear cell adenocarcinoma have occurred in men, in the left side of the colon. Nearly all formed part of a larger conventional adenoma. The prognosis of these tumours is currently unclear, and further studies will be required in order to improve our understanding of this condition. Objective: To illustrate an uncommon variant a gastrointestinal cancer affecting duodenal ampulla with little known experience as only 20 previous cases are reported in international literature. Diagnosis criteria and therapeutic approach can be useful to understand the nature and prognosis of these tumours. Method: Pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen (Whipple procedure) was studied from a 47-year-old female with a previous clinical report of abdominal pain, distension. A computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen showed an ill defined mass afecting pancreatic head and duodenal ampulla Results: Microscopic examination showed showed a neoplastic proliferation composed by sheets of signet ring cells without any glandular differentiation and with wide extension in duodenal mucosa and some extracellular mucin lakes. There was Infiltrative growth in the entire thickness of the bowel wall and pancreatic acini in a 2,5 cm global area. No metastases in regional lymph node were found. Conclusion: Signet ring cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is a tumour with not well known origin and heterotopic gastric tissue has been postulated as the source of signet ring cells. Prognosis in cases described is closely related with stage and complete surgical resections. After a 6 month follow-up our patient remains free of disease. Objective: Investigation of the biomarkers that affect the pathogenesis and/or prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are being carried out seriously. RacGAP1 (Rac guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein 1) is a protein that has crutial roles in cytokinesis, cell growth regulation, cell transformation and metastasis. It has recently been reported to participate in progression of various tumours, such as breast carcinoma. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of RacGAP1 on gastric GISTs for the first time in the literature. Method: RacGAP1 expression in 62 cases of gastric GISTs were analyzed immunohistochemically and correlated with the clinicopathological features [age, gender, risk group, mitotic count in 50 high power fields, tumour size, growth pattern, cellularity, nuclear pleomorphism, ulceration, hemorrhage, necrosis, tumour cell type], and Ki-67 labeling index, statistically. Results: RacGAP1 expression showed direct correlation with Ki-67 labeling index (p: 0.014), mitotic count (p: 0.036), high-risk groups according to both Fletcher's and Miettinen&Lasota's criteria (p: 0.032, p:0.022, respectively), epithelioid cell type (p: 0.038), and higher cellularity (p: 0.008). Conclusion: We suggest that overexpression of RacGAP1 is an indicator of adverse prognosis for gastric GISTs, and RacGAP1 might be used as an alternative marker instead of Ki-67 as a proliferation marker. Objective: Neoplasm with hepatoid features is a special type of cancer characterized by morphological features similar to hepatocellular carcinoma; It has been found in different organs such as the stomach, lung, pancreas,esophagus, papilla of vater, gallbladder, colon/rectum, kidney, urinary bladder, uterus, ovaries and peritoneum. Gastric Hepatoid AdenoCarcinoma (GHAC) have an incidence of 0,38-1 % among all gastric cancers. The diagnosis is based on recognition of characteristic histologic features. Method: A 54-year-old male patient with a history of squamous cell carcinoma in piriform sinus. Which presents DVT, inflammatory arthropathy 2 months of evolution, back pain radiated to lower limbs that prevents ambulation and unresponsive to analgesic treatment. It presents osteolytic lesion in left hip which is biopsied. The microscopic examination showed atypical poligonal neoplastic cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, prominent nuclei and high mitotic activity. Results: Immunohistochemical staining revealed positive for: CK7, CK8, CK19, CDX2, MUC2, MUC 5AC, Hepatocyte. And histochemical +: PAS, PAS-D. And negativity for: CK20, AFP, TTF1, S-100, CD 117, CD10, PSA. The diagnosis was compatible with GHAC. The patient died four days after diagnosis. Conclusion: -GHAC usually occurs in older people, although occasional early cases have been detected. -Clinically, a characteristic of these neoplasms is the extensive vascular infiltration, reflected in the high incidence of metastases (liver, lymph node). -GHAC is characterized by aggressive behavior and extremely poor prognosis compared with conventional gastric adenocarcinoma. -The majority of patients demonstrate an elevated serum AFP level, however 46 % of GHAC tissues were negatively stained with AFP. -Immunohistochemistry may help the differential diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Objective: The etiology of granulomas in the GI tract is heterogeneous, making the differential diagnosis challenging. Method: We analized the cases of three young patients, a female and two males, who underwent ileocolic resection, with granulomas on the H&E slides.",

            "text": "Results: In all the cases we identified areas of mucosa that were severely inflamed, ulcerated, covered by granulation tissue and exudate. In two cases the remaining mucosa had preserved architecture and granulomatous lesions with central necrosis. From these two cases, one had family history of tuberculosis that correlated with the confluent pattern of granulomas with central, amorphous, eosinophilic necrosis, favoring the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis, despite the negative Ziehl-Neelsen reaction. The other case with necrotizing granulomas presented suppurative intramural inflammation, also involving the lymph nodes, without chronic abnormalities. The most reliable diagnosis was infectious enterocolitis. Ziehl-Neelsen reaction was negative, while serology was positive for Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteridis. Whereas, in the third case we observed architectural crypt distorsion, basal plasmacytosis and pyloric gland metaplasia. The inflammation was transmural, forming granulomas and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. Muscularis mucosae and muscularis propria were hypertrophic, causing 'muscularization of submucosa'. Histological features favored the diagnosis of Crohn disease. Conclusion: When confronting with intestinal granulomatous inflammatory lesions it is very important to corelate the pathologic features with clinical history and endoscopic appearence. Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are the most common primary mesenchymal tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. Our objective was to correlate MDM2 immunohistochemical overexpression to clinicopathological features of GIST. Method: It was a retrospective study of 43 cases of GIST (2009 GIST ( -2012 . The diagnosis was based on CD117 immunohistochemical expression. MDM2 immunohistochemical staining was performed on archival paraffin-embedded and formol-fixed specimens. The risk assessement was based on mitotic and tumour size according to AFIP criteria. Results: The mean age was 55.11 ans. The stomach was the most affected site (51.2 %). Twenty five cases (61 %) had high risk tumours. The overall MDM2 expression was found in 68.4 % cases; high risk tumours stained mostly for MDM2 (78,6 %). Matastasis occured in 36 % of cases, with statistical correlation to MDM2 overexpression (p = 0,001), as much as the local agressiveness (p = 0,01). MDM2 was positive in 76.9 % among tumours >5 cm; positive in 64.3 % when mitosis >5/50HPF. Conclusion: MDM2 was mostly overexpressed in high grade GIST tumours, and was correlated to metastasis occurrence. Further studies are needed to confirm MDM2 as a marker of poor prognosis.",

Method: A 54 year old woman with lower abdominal pain and tenderness presented to gastroenterology clinic. She had no family history of familial adenomatous polyposis, multiple endocrine neoplasia type II or Cowden syndrome. Colonoscopy revealed a 2 mm polyp in descending colon and removed by forceps biopsy. There were no remarkable findings in terminal ileum and the other segments of colonic mucosa.

At immunohistochemistry all proliferated cells stained strongly with S100 protein and no immunoreactivity for smooth muscle actin, CD34 and CD117. Conclusion: It should be in mind in differential diagnosis of mesenchymal polypoid lesions in the colon. Results: The results showed little concordance across the three systems. The Kendall coefficient of concordance (KCC) agreement scores were: CAP: 2-poor, 2-fair; Evans-1-fair, 1-moderate, 2-good; MDA-1-poor, 2-moderate, 1-good. Using fibrosis in RG for the CAP system was a source of discrepancy. In the Evans system, quantifying tumour viability using artificial percentage cut-offs (ie. 9 vs 10 %,etc.) was fraught with difficulty. Although the MDA system generated greatest concordance, it is felt this was due to \"oversimplification\" surrounding arbitrary thresholds (</> than 5 % of tumour).",

Method: A healthy asymptomatic male in his 40's visited our hospital for a medical checkup, and a gastroendoscopy revealed a small polyp at the esophagocardiac junction. Since endoscopic biopsy revealed growth of pleomorphic mesenchymal cells, we chose the esophagofundectomy for the method of treatment. Results: Pathology of the resected specimen revealed a pedunculated polyp (size: 6-mm), the top of which was covered with atypical squamous epithelium and underneath were the dissociative pleomorphic spindle cells. Immunohistochemically, only the epithelial element was positive for AE1/ AE3 and p40, whilst the spindle cells were positive for vimentin and negative for AE1/AE3 and p40. Both elements showed frequent labeling with p53 and Ki-67. HMB45 was negative in both elements. The malignant cell growth was restricted in a small area of the upper half of the polyp. The postoperative course has been uneventful as of the 12-month follow-up. Conclusion: The lesion in our case, despite its smaller size compared to those of esophageal carcinosarcoma reported so far, already comprised of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements as evidenced by their immunephenotype. It is suggested that the two way differentiation occurs at quite an early stage. Objective: We report an interesting case of GIST involving an appendix with fibrous obliteration of the lumen. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) of the appendix are a rare entity. Some studies have reported that the fibrous obliteration of the appendix can mimic an acute appendicitis. Method: An 43-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of lower abdominal pain for several days. He underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis. For histopathological evaluation we used hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) staining. Five immunohistochemical staining antibodies were performed (vimentin, CD117, S100, CD34 and Ki67). Results: Macroscopic examination revealed an obliterated lumen of appendix and an irregular and asymmetrical thickening of the appendiceal wall. Histological examination show the lack of normal appendiceal mucosa and the lumen was displaced by a fibrous proliferation. In the subserosal layer we found a small nodule that consists densely packed cellular structure formed by spindle-shaped cells. These cells were positive for vimentin, CD117 (c-kit), CD34 and S100. The Ki-67 proliferation index of the tumour was 3 %. Conclusion: The tumour was diagnosed as very low risk GIST of vermiform appendix.

            "text": "The expression of mesothelin associated with tumour aggressiveness in gastric adenocarcinoma S.-H. Han * , S. Park * Seoul National University, Bundang Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Seongnam, Republic of Korea Objective: In Korea, gastric cancer remains the most common cancer in men. The pleural metastasis with gastric cancer patients was associated with poor survival. Due to diversity of morphologic features, the immunohistochemical stains are performed to assist in the differential diagnosis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the expression of mesothelial markers and discuss their clinicopathological significance associated with patient's outcome. Objective: Present a series of cases of young patients with colorectal cancer that present a new onset malignancy not related to the primary tumour and describe its MLH1,MSH2, and BRAF mutations. Method: Data was collected retrospectively from the electronic database between years 2004-2014. Selection criteria were: colorectal carcinoma, <50 years and new onset malignancy not related to the primary tumour following the recommendations of the modified Bethesda guidelines. Immunohistochemistry staining was made for MLH1, MSH2, PMS2 and MSH6 using automatized equipment. BRAFV600 mutation analysis was made using a real-time PCR. Results: Initially 334 cases were retrieved, but only 18 were adequate for analysis. Mean age was 40.39 \u00b1 7.28 years. The most common histopathological staging of their colorectal cancer was IIIB (38.8 %). New onset malignancies were located most frequently in colon (50 %) followed by endometrium, stomach, ovary, skin, adrenal gland, and pancreas. MLH1 was the most common molecular alteration (61.1 %) and all cases were negative to BRAFV600E mutation, which strongly suggest a Lynch syndrome. Conclusion: This is the first series of cases realized in the northern part of Mexico, which includes second neoplasms associated with Lynch syndrome. The absence of BRAF mutation in all cases opens a possibility for new studies to clarify the role of other molecular alterations in the pathogenesis of early-onset colorectal cancer. Understanding of these processes may lead to new treatments targeting specific molecular pathways. Objective: Amyloidosis of the colon is a rare disease presenting with non-specific symptoms, but can lead to life-threatening conditions. The purpose of the abstract is to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic behavior in a case of amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma. Method: We present a patient with abundant hematochezia, anemia, polypoid lesions in the colon, diagnosed by fibro colonoscopy. Total colectomy was performed. The histological result shows amyloidosis and polyposis of the colon. Bone marrow puncture confirmed myeloma in the same patient. Results: Total colectomy was performed urgently due to massive hematochezia. Gastrointestinal passage is recovered through ileo-recto anastomosis with Stapler. The histological result shows AL amyloidosis with polyposis, associated with multiple myeloma. The therapy with melphalan and prednisolone was started following the NCCN guideline for treatment of amyloidosis. The patient was followed up for 1 year and is alive up to the moment. Conclusion: Surgical procedure should be contemplated only in an emergency setting (bleeding or perforation), as it is in our case because of the risk of decompensation of organs affected by amyloidosis. If a patient with hematochezia unresponsive to conservative treatment and polyposis, amyloidosis of colon should be considered. Knowledge of the disease provides timely standardized treatment. Results: The mean age was 66.0 years and the Male/Female sex ratio was 1.3. Fourteen patients (7.5 %) had two tumours within the resection; the more aggressive tumour was studied. Overall, 101 patients (54.0 %) had a right colon tumour, 12 (6.4 %) a transverse colon tumour and 74 (39.6 %) a left colon tumour. The mean size of tumours per location ranged from 4.8 to 5.0 cm. Most tumours were predominantly conventional adenocarcinomas (88.2 %), followed by mucinous adenocarcinomas (9.1 %), signet-ring cell carcinomas (1.6 %) and neuroendocrine carcinomas (1.1 %). Most cases of mucinous adenocarcinomas (64.7 %) and neuroendocrine carcinomas (100 %) were located in the right colon. Vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion was found most frequently in neuroendocrine carcinomas (100 %) and signet-ring cell carcinomas (66.7 %), compared to conventional adenocarcinomas (31.5 %) and mucinous adenocarcinomas (17.6 %). Finally, most cases were stage II (39.6 %), followed by stage III (30.5 %), stage IV (21.9 %) and stage I (8.0 %). Conclusion: We can now confirm for the first time the similarity in the pathological characteristics of surgically removed colon cancer in Lebanon and other countries. Objective: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Turkey and in the world. Although surgery is curative for stage I, II and III A diseases, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has emerged as a standard care of locally advanced diseases. Pathologic response is considered a treatment effect. The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinicopathologic impact of mucin pools for the rectum cancer. Method: Totally 91 cases of rectal cancer were underwent surgery followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy between 2010 and 2015. Eighty of 91 cases were re-evaluated by histopathologically for mucin pools. Results: The complete pathological response rate was 4,3 % (4 of 91). At a median follow up period of 43 months, 23 (25,2 %) had died of disease, 3 (3,2 %) had recurrence, 3 (3,2 %) had metastasis. Mucin pools were present in 28 specimens (30 %); 3 were acellular (3,2 %). Most often recurrent and metastatic diseases had subserosal mucin pools. Conclusion: This study suggested that deeply invasive mucin pools had poor outcome. The pathologic assessment is important to detect response of therapy. Especially specimen sampling and sections of tissue may cause to miss single tumour cells in the mucin pools. Objective: Intra-abdominal heterotopic ossification (IHO) is an uncommon, reactive condition where areas of metaplastic bone are seen in mesentery or peritoneum. In most cases it follows abdominal trauma. Mechanism of bone formation in soft tissue is not clear. Method: We present a case of 53 year old man with IHO diagnosed 5 years after partial colectomy, performed because of sigmoid carcinoma. The patient was admitted to the hospital with acute symptoms of bowel obstruction. During the operation part of small intestine was excised and sent for the histological examination. Results: Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides revealed the presence of multiple areas of heterotopic bone, granulation tissue with multinucleated giant cells and clusters of macrophages in mesentery. The diagnosis of IHO as a cause of bowel obstruction was rendered. Conclusion: Intra-abdominal heterotopic ossification is a very rare condition considered as a reactive process. In most cases IHO follows abdominal trauma. It may be asymptomatic or may lead to bowel obstruction. Surgical intervention is performed only in symptomatic cases. IHO ossification shows the tendency for recurrence but has no malignant potential. Prognosis for the patient is usually good, in rare cases morbidity is connected with bowel obstruction. Objective: Mastocytic colitis is a new entity, characterized by increased mucosal mast cells (more than 20 per high-power field) in the colon. There is no correlation with any type of mastocytosis. Some studies suggest that increased mast cells are present in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and diarrhea. The aim of our study was to determine the clinical, histological and immunohistochemical features of mastocytic colitis. Method: We present a case of mastocytic colitis, in a 72 years old male who had a 4-year history of chronic watery diarrhea. Results: A colonoscopy revealed grossly normal findings. Microscopically of random biopsies of the sigmoid colon showed non specific mild inflammatory edema in the lamina propria. A CD117 immunohistochemical stain was revealed more than 20 mast cells per high-power field. A finding consistent with the diagnosis of mastocytic colitis. Conclusion: The presence of mast cells was either missed due to lack of ability to see mast cells on biopsies, it may be useful to perform a CD 117 immunostain in patients with unexplained chronic diarrhea with normal colonic mucosa. Counting mast cells in gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies is becoming an increasingly common practice. Results: A total of 20 patients with histologically proven DT were included. The majority of patients were female (85 %) and the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 32. The average tumour size was 7.32 cm. Two groups were distinguished: The first represented 60 % of cases found mainly in women and localized to the abdominal wall, although well limited in radiological imaging, with a tendency to frequent recurrence. The second group represented 40 % of cases, intra-abdominal or at the expense of members. They were poorly limited in imaging with recurrence even after complete resection. Tumour cells expressed Vimentin intensely in all cases. CD34, C-kit and Ki67 were negative in all cases. Hormone receptors were positive in one case. Objective: Pigmentation of the gastric mucosa is a rare endoscopic and histologic finding and can be induced by different deposits: iron, calcium, barium sulphate, charcoal, melanin, lipofuscin and other. Method: We present the case of a 34-year-old female patient with ulcerlike dyspeptic syndrome and underwent BTD and proton pump inhibitors treatment. Because of persistent symptoms, gastroscopy with biopsies was performed three days later and BTD was discontinued. One month later, gastroscopy showed a normal mucosa. Results: The first gastroscopy revealed an extensive and diffuse inflammatory mucosa, with a friable and \"solid plaque\"-like aspect, raising the suspicion of a gastric lymphoma. The biopsies taken from the corpus and fundic region of the stomach showed a diffuse mild chronic gastritis, active, erosive, non-atrophic, negative for Helicobacter pylori, with mild hyalinosis of the lamina propria and the presence of diffuse amorphous black-brown pigment deposits located on the mucosal surface, within the exudate, within the foveolae and under the superficial regenerative epithelium. Perls stain was negative, excluding iron deposits. The second biopsies showed a normal mucosa, with no pigmentation. Conclusion: This case highlights the need for the differential diagnosis and shows the importance of communication between the gastroenterologist and pathologist. Bismuth is known to induce oral pigmentation (black tongue, a blue-black line along gingival margin and even mucosal esophageal necrosis when associated with salicylates). ",

            "text": "Objective: The gallbladder is an unusual location for heterotopic pancreas (HP) which is defined as the presence of pancreatic tissue without any anatomic or vascular continuity with the main body of the pancreas.HP has been noted in the stomach (24-38 %), duodenum (9-36 %), jejunum (0.5-27 %), ileum (3-6 %) and Meckel's diverticulum (2-6.5 %), but has been rarely seen in the gallbladder. Method: We report a case of a 55-year-old female, complaining of biliary colic. The patient was hospitalized and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed for acute cholecystitis. On macroscopic examination, the gallbladder measured 10 cm in length and 3.5 cm in circumference, with a wall thickness from 0.3-0.5 cm.On cutting open, the mucosa was velvety flattened and a single yellow stone measuring 0.7 cm in diameter was found in the lumen of the gallbladder. In the neck region in the pericholecystic fat a firm, round, yellow nodule, measuring 1,2 cm in diameter was found. The tissue specimens were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and stained with H&E. Results: On microscopic examination the nodule showed a wellcircumscribed ectopic pancreatic tissue composed of lobules of exocrine pancreatic acini, ducts without any connection to the gallblader lumen and no islet cells. The remaining sections had features of chronic cholecystitis with acute exacerbation. Conclusion: In our case the heterotopic pancreas has been classified as type 2 by von Heinrich classification. Objective: We aim to report a case of a desmoplastic small round cell tumour from the pelvic region that was thought to be a colorectal tumour. Method: A 41-year-old man came to the emergency room with rectal bleeding and abdominal cramping. During colonoscopy a rectal mass was found and biopsied. A CT scan showed multiple heterogeneous masses in the pelvic region, hepatic metastasis and abdominal and retroperitoneal adenopathies. Results: Rectal biopsy showed an infiltrating neoplasia composed of nests and trabeculae of small round cells, round nuclei with dispersed chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, the cells were positive for cytokeratins 8/18 and 7, EMA, desmin (dot pattern), CD57, vimentin and NSE (moderate intensity) and negative for chromogranin A, synapthophysin, CD56, S100 protein, CDX-2 and PSA. There was cytoplasmatic glycogen. It was diagnosed as desmoplastic small round cell tumour. Conclusion: Desmoplastic small round cell tumour is a rare and highly aggressive tumour of undetermined histogenesis that caused the death of our patient 3 weeks after the diagnosis. In this specific case the diagnosis was challenging since it was histologically similar to a neuroendocrine tumour. Objective: Gallbladder schwannomas are extremely rare and usually discovered incidentally. We report on the case of a gallbladder schwannoma in 73 year old male patient with recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain and jaundice. Method: The ultrasonography and CT scan revealed gallstones and thickening of the gallbladder wall. The patient underwent ERCP with gastric biopsy due to a suspicious lesion on the posterior wall. Under the diagnosis of early gastric cancer and cholecystolithiasis, gastrectomy and cholecystectomy were performed. On gross examination the gallbladder measured 4 x 3 cm with thickening of parts of the wall up to 0,7 cm. The mucosa was velvety, flattened, with six solid yellow stones present in the lumen. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue samples of the thickened parts were stained with HE and immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies against S-100, CD-56, CD-57, Ki 67 and CK19. Results: Microscopic examination revealed a tumour mainly consisted of spindle shaped cells (Antoni A), admixed with extremely rare Antoni B cells. Neither atypical cells, nor signs of malignancy were found. Immunohistochemically the cells were positive for S-100, CD-56 with Ki67 < 2 %. Conclusion: Gallbladder is unusual and extremely rare localization for schwannomas, therefore immunohistochemistry is a necessary tool for definite diagnosis. Objective: Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms occurring mainly in the gastrointestinal tract. Tumour size, mitotic rate and location are the main prognostic features. We present two unusual cases, one presenting as a gastric cyst, and the other localized in the head of the pancreas. Method: Case1: 69-year-old female was admitted with upper abdominal pain and a palpable epigastric lump. Ultrasonography and CT revealed a cystic mass with 58 \u00d7 58 \u00d7 61 mm.

Results: Case1: Macroscopic examination revealed a well circumscribed, cystic lesion with 7 cm, with an irregular inner surface. Histology revealed an epithelioid neoplasm with 2mitosis/15 mm2. Case2: Grossly, revealed an intrapancreatic, well circumscribed, whitish, solid tumour with 55 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 35 mm. Histology revealed a predominant fusiform neoplasm with 2mitosis/15 mm2. Both cases were positive for DOG-1 and CD34. Conclusion: Literature suggests that in cystic GISTs, tumour size is not a true indicator of aggressiveness. The larger the cystic component, the lower the objectivity in determining tumour size. Extra-GISTs, especially pancreatic origin, are very rare thus its biological behavior is unknown. More cases and long-term follow-up studies are needed to predict the outcome of unusual GISTs. Objective: The extranodal extension (ENE) of nodal metastases, i.e. the extension of neoplastic cells through the nodal capsule into the perinodal soft tissue, is a histological feature that has recently been considered an important prognostic factor in various types of tumour. It has yet to be taken into account by the TNM staging system for upper gastro-intestinal cancer, however. Method: To provide a complete evaluation of the prognostic role of ENE in such neoplasms, a systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted. Comparing patients with ENE (ENE+) vs. intra-nodal extension (ENE-), we summarized the data using risk ratios (RR) for the number of deaths/recurrences, and hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for potential confounders, for the time-dependent risk related to ENE positivity. Results: The presence of ENE was associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk and hazard ratio both statistically significant), cancer-specific mortality (relative risk and hazard ratio both statistically significant), and disease recurrence (relative risk and hazard ratio both statistically significant). Conclusion: For upper gastro-intestinal cancers, our results indicate that ENE should be considered for prognostic purposes from the gross sampling to the pathology report, and also by future oncologic staging systems. Objective: To asses the pathologic tumour response (PTR) in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) with synchronous liver metastases treated with an inverse strategy of chemotherapy first followed by surgery resection and correlates both with chemotherapeutic agents. Method: Forty-two patients were included. Chemotherapeutic agents were classified into: Cytostatic agents (CA), combination with monoclonal antibody against the epithelial growth factor (anti-EGFR) or with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PTR was assessed using a four grade score based on residual tumour cells.",

            "text": "Results: Twelve patients showed PTR more than 50 % in both liver and intestine. Liver PTR was greater with the association of CA+VEGF (median 95 %) followed by CA+anti-EGFR and CA. In the primary was greater with CA anti-EGFR (median 55 %), followed by CA and CA+ VGEF. No response or poor tumour response was significantly more frequent in primary tumours than metastases. Liver chemotherapy with CA causes more fibrosis as a form or regression (median 65 %) than other associations and CA+VEGF more necrosis. Conclusion: PTR is greater in liver metastases than in primary tumours and increases when CA is associated with anti-EGFR. In primary tumours all chemotherapeutic agents produce fibrosis as the main form of regression and in the liver by CA. Objective: Although extremely rare, neoplasms with overlapping histological and immunohistochemical features to gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract (extra GISTs -EGISTs). Method: A 64-year-old female was admitted to the hospital for myalgia and diffuse abdominal back pain present for several months. The abdominal CT scan revealed a sparsely delimitated, heterogenous, solid, tumour mass in the right paravetebral region. Consecutively, surgery was indicated. Results: Macroscopical examination revealed a nodular, encapsulated, yellow-whitish, elastic tumour, measuring 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 cm. On light microscopy, the tumour was infiltrating the surrounding connective capsula, extending into the adjacent skeletal muscles. The tumour was composed of large, pleomorphic spindle cells, arranged in a storifom or fascicular pattern, with a high mitotic index (40mitoses/50HPF). Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD117, CD34, Vimentin, and negativity for S100, SMA, CD99. Morphological and immunohistochemical features leaded to a diagnosis of EGIST (intermediate risk form). Conclusion: We herein report a rare, challenging case of primary EGISTs of the retroperitoneum. This diagnosis should be considered when imaging studies reveal an abdominal, retroperitoneal mass, without connection to the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis, prognosis and optimal treatment of these tumours are not yet fully elucidated. In absence of these data, an accurate follow-up is recommended. Objective: Solid primary mesenterial tumours are characterised by low incidence (1:200,000-1:350,000) and predominance of lipomas. Our objective is to present a rare tumour-primary mesenterial leiomyosarcoma. Method: Medical documentation, pathology/immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides and radiologic investigations were reviewed in the context of up-to-date scientific literature. Results: A 47-year-old woman complained of mild right upper abdominal pain. The computed tomography disclosed multiple liver metastases from cancer of unknown primary location. Liver biopsy showed loose bundles of spindled cells exhibiting nuclear polymorphism and atypical mitoses. High-grade sarcoma was evident, suggesting differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumour or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, among others. On exploratory laparoscopy, a neoplasm (5.5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4.3 cm) was found in mesentery below lig. Treitzi next to a.mesenterica superior. The mass was excised simultaneously with liver metastasis. Microscopically, tumour was composed of disarrayed spindle cell bundles in hypocellular myxoid stroma with hyalinosis. There were 21 mitoses/10 high-power fields. IHC was positive for actin and desmin, but negative for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CD34, CD117. The proliferation fraction (Ki-67) was 72.0 %. No other masses were found elsewhere, including stomach, intestines or uterus. Thus, high-grade mesenteric leiomyosarcoma with hepatic metastases was diagnosed. Conclusion: Here we show a well-documented primary mesenterial leiomyosarcoma: highly unusual cause of metastatic liver lesion.",

We report this entity in a patient without history of previous surgeries. Method: A 67 year old woman who underwent an atypical gastric resection due to a clinical diagnosis of gastric GIST. Results: Macroscopically, a polypoid lesion with a nodular surface and a central ulcer was observed, with multiple cysts and solid areas on crosssection. Histologically, the gastric mucosa showed focal lesions of chronic atrophic gastritis with activity, hemorrhage and ulceration, whereas the submucosa and muscularis propria displayed an abundant cystically dilated pyloric-type and foveolar-type glandular proliferation, without mitoses or atypia; surrounding the glands there was a thin layer of lamina propria and fibromuscular hyperplasia. The diagnosis of Gastritis cystica profunda was made. Conclusion: Gastritis cystica profunda must be differentiated from gastric well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and pancreatic heterotopia. Since pancreatic ducts were not observed, there was no desmoplasia and the glands had a benign morphology, without atypia, these entities were excluded. Even though it is a benign lesion it can be associated with dysplasia and stump carcinoma, thus follow-up is advised. Objective: HDGC is a form of gastric cancer familial aggregation, characteristically with increase lifetime risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC). Germline mutations in the CDH1 gene is detected in 30 % a 40 % of cases (WHO). Our aim is to study the clinico-pathological features of HGDC with the help of 3 CDH1 mutation carriers that met the clinical criteria of HGDC as well as review of the literature and recommended guidelines. Method: Gastric biopsies (Cambridge Protocol) and one surgical specimen, from 3 CDH1 mutation carriers, were examined thoroughly and put in perspective with clinical context and previous studies. Results: No lesions were found in endoscopy/macroscopic examination. However, histology showed tiny intramucosal foci of DGC in 1/25 and 3/38 fragments from the biopsies of each patient and in a few slides from the gastrectomy. The absence of atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia was noted. Conclusion: Our results emphasize recommendation of extensive sampling and careful evaluation of the lesions by a pathologist with experience in this pathology. HGDC patients are advised endoscopic surveillance and/or prophylactic total gastrectomy. These options are highly individualised.",

            "text": "Objective: Synchronous or collision tumours of colon are rare, but two synchronous adenocarcinoma, both colliding with an ovarian carcinoma, are exceedingly rare. Method: A 67-year-old woman with 4-month history of constipation and weight loss was diagnosed with rectal cancer infiltrating the uterus, with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Rectosigmoidectomy with total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed and the specimen was submitted to the department of pathology. Results: Gross examination of the intestine revealed two cancers, separated by a distance of 11 cm, apparently both infiltrating the peritoneal surface. Ovaries were enlarged, white nodular and firm. There were numerous white firm nodules on the peritoneal surface, of 0,5-3 cm in size, and the omentum was transformed into a white, solid mass. Microscopically, both colon tumours were well differentiated adenocarcinoma invading subserosal tissue. Tumours in ovaries, as well as all the nodules on the peritoneum and omentum, were diagnosed as serous ovarian carcinoma, confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Both colon adenocarcinomas were colliding with metastases from the ovarian serous carcinoma, which infiltrated from the surface of peritoneum into the muscularis propria, without admixture at their interface (confirmed with CK7 and CK20 stainings). All the lymph nodes metastases were of serous carcinoma. Conclusion: Even our patient had two colon adenocarcinomas, the most aggressive was the ovarian serous carcinoma. Objective: Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) \u226540 kg/m2 are defined as class III obese. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a commonly used surgical method for weight loss in these patients. Method: Histopathological findings in LSG specimens of 129 consecutive class III obese patients were re-evaluated. Results: Ninety-four patients (73 %) were female. Mean age was 37,43 (range 17-65 years). Their BMI differed between 40 and 62 kg/m2. The vast majority of the cases had chronic gastritis (97 %), with active inflammation in nearly one third (29 %). Helicobacter Pylori (HP) associated gastritis with nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) was seen in 63,5 %. Notably, NLH without evidence of HP was detected in almost one quarter (n = 31; 24 %). Twenty-three percent had mucosal changes due to proton pump inhibitors. None had gastric dysplasia, however regenerative mucosal changes were seen in 30 %. Intestinal metaplasia and atrophy were rarely detected (6 %). Prior endoscopy was performed in only 4 patients (3,1 %). No significant association was found between BMI and presence and/or severity of gastritis. Conclusion: A wide spectrum of histopathological findings has been reported in LSGs, as gastritis being the most common finding. We also found a higher prevalence of HP, compared to previous reports, suggesting that HP eradication may be necessary in majority of patients undergoing LSG. Objective: Gastric carcinoma is a common cancer type and serious cause of death. In this study, we have investigated in clinical prognostic effect of DEK expression in gastric cancer and the correlation between survival and expression rate. Method: A total of 34 cases of gastric cancer patients who underwent surgery in our hospital, between 2010 and 2015 were selected for this study. Immunhistochemistry for DEK was performed on paraffin embedded tumour tissues. A nuclear staining in tumour cells was considered to be positive for DEK. The percentage of cells expressing DEK scored as <25 %, 25-50 %, >50 %. Staining intensity was recorded as weak or moderate/ strong. High level DEK expression was defined as a moderate/ strong staining in at least 25 % of tumour cells. Low level DEK expression was defined as positive nuclear staining with weak intensity. Results: The patients age varies between 7 and 77, male female ratio was approximately 2.14 of the cases were tubular adenocarcinoma, 20 of the cases were poorly cohesive carcinoma according to WHO 2010 classification. 23 of the cases were identified as high level, 11 of the cases showed low level DEK expression. Half of the low level stained cases lived more than 24 months, on the other hand 22 of the 24 cases which was categorized as high level staining lived far less than 24 months. This findings was statistically significant. Conclusion: Increased expression of human DEK proto-oncogen has been associated with numerous malignancies. High level DEK expression is though to be associated with poor prognosis, and low survival rate. Further research is needed to determinate prognostic value of this proto-oncogene expression in gastric carcinoma. Objective: Adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the anal canal is a rare disease comprising only 5 % of all anorectal neoplasias and 1.5 % of all gastrointestinal tumours. We report 2 new cases of this rare neoplasm with long proctologic medical history but with two different outcomes. Method: We identified in our database two cases of ADC of the anal canal diagnosed in 2 women. Results: The first patient was a 71 year old woman followed for more than 10 years for hemorrhoids and anal prolapsed treated medically. After, physical examination found a 3 cm bulging mass 1 cm from the anal verge. The biopsies concluded to a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma expressing CK7 and CK20. The second patient was a 62 year old female patient, with a long medical history of anal fistula treated many times with surgery but no anatomopathology exam were made. A bulging mass of the anal canal was discovered in physical examination measuring 4 cm with 3 anal fistula. The patient had neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. The anatomopathology concluded to a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the anal glands CK7-and CK20+. The follow up of the patient showed no sign of recurrence. Conclusion: The pathogeny is still unknown. Symptomatology has no specificity and the diagnosis is often late, in an advanced stage of the sickness. Recurrent or non recurrent fistula-in-ano requires multiple biopsies for pathology analysis in order to screen a related cancer. Tumour dimension, lymph node involvement, histologic grade and treatment modality are independent prognosis factors for survival. Early suspicion is crucial to avoid delayed diagnosis and treatment. Objective: Endometriosis is a rather frequent condition of fertile women, and often cause of sterility and chronic pelvic pain. Endometriosis is gonadal or extragonadal, the last, seldom occurs in the intestinal wall. Intestinal foci cause diarrhea or constipation through impaired peristalsis and obstruction. Method: Our patient is a 44 years old woman with a few months alteration of constipation and diarrhea. She was admitted for subocclusive syndrome, mild inflammatory syndrome with normal fecal calprotectin, mild anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Colonoscopy describes an incomplete stenosis in lower sigmoid, suggestive of Crohn's disease, while abdominal tomography reveales a diffuse thickening of the sigmoid wall. Laparotomy found an intramural tumour adherent to the left ureter. Results: Intramural colonic endometriosis infiltrating subserosa, muscularis propria and submucosa with areas of hemorrhage was diagnosed extemporaneously, and confirmed on paraffin embedded tissue with immunohistochemistry and special stains. Postoperative evolution was favorable. Conclusion: Endometriosis may evolve aggressively, extending in muscularis propria along the nerve plexi, and in lymph nodes. It can have a pseudo-acute presentation with intestinal obstruction or severe diarrhea and may be confused with inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal tumours. Objective: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a bariatric surgical procedure used in morbid obesity. In this study, histopathologic changes in the SG specimens of obese Turkish patients have been characterized. Method: 50 SG cases re-evaluated using H&E, PAS-Alcian Blue and Modified Giemsa staining. For cases with gastritis, Sydney classification was used. Location and distribution of lymphoid aggregates/follicles in the gastric mucosa noted. Results: Average age was 38 year with a female to male ratio of 6:1. BMI ranged from 40 to 65 kg/m 2 . 37 cases (68 %) had chronic active gastritis, 11 cases (22 %) had chronic inactive gastritis and 4 cases (4 %) had normal histology. Presence of H. pylori was detected in 34 cases (68 %). In almost all cases (98 %), lymphoid aggregates/follicles were present. Lymphoid tissue extended from muscularis mucosae to the lumen, filling the entire mucosa, in 27 cases (54 %). Intestinal metaplasia, cystic dilatation of mucosal glands due to PPI usage, and hyperplastic polyps were other changes. No statistically relevant relationship was found between histopathologic changes and patient parameters. Conclusion: Histopathologic changes seen in Turkish SG cases have not been previously studied. Compared to other SG studies in the literature, there was a higher rate of chronic gastritis and H. pylori in our cases. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the concordance in diagnosis of gastric epithelial neoplasia among pathologists with different levels of experience. Method: The study included gastric biopsies from 32 cases from different Institutes (Medical Faculties and Training and research hospitals) in Istanbul. They were diagnosed with spectrum from normal to invasive carcinoma. All biopsies were renanalysed according to Vienna Classification blindly by 29 pathologists who were working different Institutes with different experience level in GIS. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient and kappa analyses were applied for agreement among observers. Results: Distribution of the initial diagnosis of the biopsises: Negative for Displasia :2; Indefinite for neoplasia: 4; Low grade displasia: 5; High grade displasia: 11; invasive neoplasia: 10. Overall agreement was high (96,5 %; p:0.000). Pathologists were two grouped as more than 15 year and less than 15 year of experience. Agreement was relatively lower in less experienced group. Lowest agrement was in cases with\u00a8Indefinite for displasia\u00a8. The concordance was high in invasive carcinoma cases in both pathologist group. Conclusion: In diagnosis of gastric epithelial neoplasias, the interobserver agreement is depended on the experience of pathologist especially on Gastrointestinal system pathology. Diagnosis of Indefinite for displasia is still problem even in experienced pathologists. Objective: Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant neoplasm worldwide. PRL-3 (phosphatase of regenerating liver-3/PTP4A3) was reported play a role in the progression of colorectal cancer. However, how the mechanisms of PRL-3 induce progression and metastatic ability, interact with others molecule such as MMP2 and E-Cadherin, remain largely unknown. To clarify the molecular proteins that involved in colorectal cancer development and progression, we investigate the expression of PRL-3, MMP2 and E-Cadherin in colorectal cancer and correlate the expression with the clinicopathologic parameters. Method: Expression of PRL-3, MMP2 and E-Cadherin in 76 colorectal cancer specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Among colorectal cancer specimens examined, there were 30 (39.5 %) well differentiated, 36 (47.4 %) moderately differentiated and 10 (13.2 %) poorly differentiated CRC. There were a significant correlation between histological grading and PRL-3 (p = 0.044), MMP2 (p = 0.040) and E-cadherin expression (p = 0.039), respectively. The expression of PRL-3 was significantly correlated with the expression of MMP2 (p < 0.001) and the expression of E-cadherin in colorectal cancer (p = 0.003). The result showed that more frequent expression of PRL-3, the higher expression of MMP2 and the lower expression of E-cadherin in colorectal cancer. Conclusion: These study strongly suggest that PRL-3 may play a role to up regulated expression of PRL-3 and down regulate the expression of Ecadherin in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. PRL-3 and MMP2 might be a novel molecular marker for aggressive colorectal cancer. Objective: Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SC-NEC) is a rare type of colon neoplasm with an incidence of only 0,6 %. It is associated with a poor prognosis and usualy with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis Method: In this report we present the case of a 41 year-old man who underwent an abdominal computed tomography and a gastrointestinal endoscopy in our institution which revealed a large tumour located in the right colon. A right hemicolectomy was performed and a large 6 cm tumour was identified in the cecum. Results: Histologically the tumour was composed with small to medium neoplastic cells arranged into irregular sheets consisted with small cell NEC. Immunohistochemistry exam was performed using eight biomarkers and a positive reaction was identifed for Synapthophisin, NSE, CD56, CDX2 and AE1/AE3. A negative imunostain was noted for Chromogranin A, TTF1 and CEA. Also it was observed a high Ki67 index prooving the high malignancy of this tumour. The most frequent molecular abnormalities identified are those involving MEN1, p53 and CDKN2/Rb genes. Conclusion: Small cell NEC is a rare diagnose in which histologic, immunophenotype and molecular features can help in understanding the biological behaviour of this type of neoplasm Objective: Coexistence of colonic carcinoma with tuberculosis is an extremely rare condition. Here we describe the case showing association of colonic adenocarcinoma with colonic tuberculosis in the course of generalized tuberculosis. Method: An 83-year-old female was subjected to autopsy at Institute of Pathology, University of Belgrade -Faculty of Medicine, with a clinical diagnosis of severe sideropenic anemia. Results: External examination revealed pronounced cachexia and pale skin. Numerous small whitish nodules were spread within the lungs, pleura and liver. Microscopic analysis confirmed that they corresponded to generalized tuberculosis. Examination of the colon showed an ulcerated nodular mass (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 cm) in the caecum. Histopathological evaluation demonstrated well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum where carcinomatous tissue was intermingled with tuberculous granulomas containing caseous necrosis, epitheloid cells and Langhans giant cells. No sarcoid-like granulomas and reactive lymphoid follicles, characteristic for Crohn disease, were seen in any segment of the colon. In liver, the tuberculous granulomas were associated with colonic metastases. Conclusion: Clinically undiagnosed adenocarcinoma of the caecum was closely associated with tuberculosis of the same site in the course of clinically unrecognized generalized tuberculosis. It is essential to record such cases in order to clarify the potential causal relationship between the carcinoma and tuberculosis. Objective: To study p53 mutation status in gastric patients of Karachi, Pakistan. Method: Total 77 formalin fixed Paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues were collected from gastric cancer patients. Followed by DNA extraction. Extraction of DNA was confirmed by amplifying a fragment of internal \u03b2-globin gene. Exon 5, 6 and 7 were amplified by primer specific PCR. Furthermore single stranded conformational polymorphism was performed on 12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mobility shift was observed by Silver staining the Gels. Results: PCR-SSCP analysis of p53 exons 5-7 revealed by band mobility shift indicative of mutation in 39 (50.6 %) from 77 FFPE of gastric cancer patient samples. Fourteen mutations were found in exon 5, six in exon 7 and nine mutations in exon 7. One sample sequence mutated in both exons 5 and 6. One sample sequence mutated in both exons 6 and 7. Three samples have mutated sequence in both exons 5 and 7. To confirm the presence of mutation, 29 cases in which aberrantly migrating bands were observed by SSCP were sequenced. Conclusion: Results outcome support the statement that cancer progression might be facilitate by mutation in various exon of p53 tumour suppressorgene.",

Ibarrola de Andr\u00e9s from tropical/subtropical regions. It may cause acute or sub-acute intestinal obstruction and it's usually diagnosed during surgery. Method: We describe a 58-year-old male patient presenting with small bowel obstruction without relevant surgical or medical history. CT of the abdomen revealed collapsed loops of small bowel. Laparotomy was performed, with a resection of jejunum-ileum of 45 cm. Results: Grossly, the surgical specimen revealed membranous adhesions enclosing the intestinal loops in a concertina-like fashion, giving a cauliflower-like appearance (figure 1). Histological examination revealed formation of thin sheets of dense fibrocollagenous tissue and focal fat necrosis with xanthomatous histiocytes (figure 2). No other type of inflammatory reaction was observed. The intestinal wall didn't show any pathology. Conclusion: Abdominal cocoon syndrome is a rare pathology and is difficult to diagnose. Several mechanisms in secondary forms include chronic peritoneal dialysis and less frequently prior abdominal surgery, several infections, beta-blocker treatment or chemotherapy. However, in some cases as in ours, the etiology remains obscure. A high index of clinical suspicion and recognition of a radiological findings should be considered in order to ensure proper management.",

            "text": "Objective: Uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS) is a rare tumour, representing 1-2 % of uterine malignancies. It is highly aggressive, has poor prognosis, a 5-year survival rate of 40 % and high metastatic rate, especially in lungs. Method: A 58-year-old woman who had undergone hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy and radiochemotherapy for ULMS 9 years ago presented with gastrointestinal bleeding. Gastroscopy showed two tumoural masses, while colonoscopy identified two pedunculated polyps on the descending colon. CT revealed abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy. Total gastrectomy and polypectomy were performed. Results: Histologically, both sites revealed proliferations of spindle cells with whorled pattern, nuclear atypia, 5 to 8 mitotic figures/10HPF and additional necrosis in the gastric tumours. Immunohistochemistry was negative for CD117, DOG1, S100, CD34 and positive for SMA, ER, PR. 20 % of nuclei stained positive for Ki67. Considering the patient's history and the immunohistochemical profile, we diagnosed the lesions as gastric and colonic metastases of ULMS. Conclusion: Regardless of the primary tumour, colonic metastases are exceptionally rare. The peculiarity of the case stands in both an extended disease-free survival and the gastrointestinal involvement. The gross appearance is similar to other types of polyps. As the experience is limited, multidisciplinary approach and long-term follow-up in managing such patients may be the best available option. Objective: We aimed to further define the characteristic features of tumour deposits (TD) with perpendicular sections. Method: Thirty paraffin blocks representing 47 TD of 15 colorectal carcinomas were selected. A median of 4(2-10) perpendicular sections of 2-3 mm-thickness were made and embedded on their cut surface. Sections were evaluated for the clues of lymph node (LN) structures (presence of capsule, capsular sinus or lymphoid tissue).",

We highly suspected of lymph node in 6/18 tumour deposits with round shape and thick capsule-like fibrosis due to the presence of minimal lymphoid tissue. After examination of additional perpendicular sections, a more organized lymphoid tissue (4), subcapsular sinus (1) and involvement of efferent lymphatics and subcapsular sinus (1) led a call for LN in 6 cases. In the rest 41 cases, additional perpendicular sections were unable to reveal any feature suggestive of LN, except one case. Overall, 7/47(15 %) TD were reclassified as metastatic LN. Conclusion: In the majority of the cases, a more detailed examination of TD with perpendicular sections was unable to uncover any relevant feature suggestive of a metastatic LN.

            "text": "Results: A previously operated 63-year old patient for colonic adenocarcinoma presented with an esophageal polyp. On histological examination, esophageal mucosa was ulcerated with many atypical, large, discohesive cells in the lamina propria (Panel a). Nuclei were pleomorphic, sometimes multiple, with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli (Panel b, arrow). They were intermingled with many granulocytes and plump vessels, in a backround of granulation tissue. Immunohistochemical study showed only positivity with vimentin (Panel c). All the other markers were negative (pan-cytokeratin, CK7, CK20, EMA, S-100, CLA, HMB45, CD31, FactXIII a, AML, CD-1a, CMV). Ki67 showed a low proliferative index. The diagnosis made was that of a benign bizarre stromal cell polyp of the esophagus. The patient is free of disease 6 months later. Conclusion: History of colonic adenocarcinoma made the diagnosis of this stromal bizarre polyp difficult and the main differential diagnosis was metastases, ruled out with immunohistochemistry. Objective: To evaluate the role and significance of Her 2neu as biomarker in premalignant and malignant lesions of uterine cervix, and to correlate its expression with stage and grade of cervical cancer. Method: This 3 year study included all the cases diagnosed as premalignant, carcinoma-in-situ, and invasive carcinoma on cervical biopsies. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for Her 2neu was done using Biogenex, Clone CB11 antibody, and results were scored according to Wolff etal 2007. Her 2neu IHC scores were correlated with the clinicopathological parameters namely grade, stage and histological type of the lesions. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (v.16.0). Results: Higher Her 2neu score correlated positively with the grade and stage of premalignant and malignant cervical lesions. Higher score was seen in malignant cases with positive lymph node status. Although -Thursday, 29 September 2016 .3 E-PS-07 Gynaecological Pathology adenocarcinoma showed a higher score than squamous cell carcinoma, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Her 2neu expression evaluation may provide additional and independent prognostic information in the clinical course of cervical cancer; and it could be a potential therapeutic target in cervical cancer treatment.",

Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) or atypical hyperplasia is the immediate precursor lesion in endometrial carcinoma which can be detected in endometrial biopsies performed due to abnormal vaginal bleeding. Method: This is a retrospective analysis performed in the Department of Pathology of the University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Romania over a period of 1 year (January 2015-January 2016) which involved a total of 264 cases of female patients with endometrial carcinoma and hyperplastic precursor lesions. We investigated 183 cases of nonatypical hyperplasia, 26 cases of atypical hyperplasia (EIN), 46 cases of endometrioid carcinoma, 5 cases of clear cell carcinoma, 3 cases of serous carcinoma and 1 case of mucinous carcinoma. Results: The most notable finding was that 23 % of the women preoperatively diagnosed with EIN on an endometrial biopsy were postoperatively discovered with endometrial carcinoma upon hysterectomy sampling. Conclusion: Although EIN has a high likelihood of progression to carcinoma, we consider these findings to be simultaneous occurrences of endometrial carcinoma due to the short time interval between diagnosis and treatment. Objective: Congenital malformations are the most important causes of fetal death and they can be defined as structural or functional anomalies that occur during intrauterine life. In the last year, in Emergency University Hospital, Bucharest, were performed 7 fetus autopsies with the clinical diagnosis of Polycystic Renal Disease. 4 of them, including this case, had Congenital Multicystic Renal Dysplasia. Method: We performed the autopsy of a 22 week old male fetus from an uninvestigated pregnancy. The autopsy report highlighted multiple malformations. We collected representative tissular fragments for histological examination, which have been processed by the classical stain H&E. Results: During the autopsy, the following were noted: ELBW-700 g fetus, postaxial polydactily of all limbs, club feet and distended abdominal wall by the presence of bilateral renal enlargement: kidneys with multiple cortical and medular cystic spaces, without pelvocaliceal occlusion, bladder abnormalities and urethral athresia. Histologically, the kidneys showed noncommunicating, irregular cysts of varying sizes in the renal and cortical region and dysplastic ducts lined by a columnar epithelium surrounded by fusiform cells. There were also few normal tubules and dystropic ones.",

Objective: Tumour-to-tumour metastasis (TTM) is a rare phenomenon corresponding to metastasis in a histologically distinct tumour. Adenocarcinoma represents 5-15 % of invasive cervical carcinomas and ovarian metastasis are not unusual. Mature cystic teratomas (MCT) account for 60 % of benign ovarian tumours and somatic malignant transformation is uncommon (1-2 %). There are no previous reports of MCT involved in TTM events. Method: We report a case of tumour-to-tumour metastasis of an endocervical adenocarcinoma to an ovarian mature cystic teratoma. Results: A 51-year-old patient presented with a cervical lesion histologically diagnosed as a poorly differentiated, HPV18+, adenocarcinoma. Staging showed a IIA2 (FIGO 2009) cervical carcinoma associated with a left ovarian multicystic tumour suggestive of teratoma with a radiological suspicious area. A bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. A left MCT with 11 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 cm was confirmed and a solid area with 2 cm of adenocarcinoma, morphologically similar to the cervical adenocarcinoma, was found. A similar immunoprofile (p16+, CEA+, vimentin-, ER-) in both adenocarcinomas was documented. HPV18DNA+ in both confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic endocervical adenocarcinoma in a mature cystic teratoma. Conclusion: Similar morphology, immunohistochemistry and HPVDNA in both malignant component of MCT and endocervical adenocarcinoma confirmed a TTM and excluded a more common, although rare, MCT malignant transformation in a perimenopausal patient. Objective: To investigate the immunohistochemical pecularities of recurrent ovarian endometriosis. Method: The study included 52 patients with recurrent ovarian endometriosis and 36 patients without recurrence, who undergone laparoscopy with stripping technique using \u00abKarl Storz\u00bb equipment with histological investigation. Immunohistochemistry was performed using immunohistostainer Bond-max (Leica, Germany) with the use of monoclonal antibodies: to estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, Ki-67, bcl-2, p53, b-katenin. Results: The expression of ER\u03b2 was 33 % in recurrent endometriosis, in non-recurrent samples-30 % (p < 0,05). The expression of PR was significantly higher in Group II (30 vs 55 %, p = 0,045). Analysis of bcl-2 expression showed that its level was higher in group I-59 % (p = 0,039). The expression of p53 was 4 times less than in group of recurrence (4 vs 19 %, p = 0,048). There was a statistically significant increase in the expression of Ki-67 and b-catenin (respectively, 25 vs 12 %, p = 0,042 and 51 vs 38 %, p = 0,039). Conclusion: Immunohistochemical assessment revealed significant differences in the expression rates of proliferation, apoptosis and intercellullar adhesion indicators in recurrent ovarian endometriosis, which will subsequently allow to work out a personalized approach to the management of patients. Objective: Endometriosis is a common condition found in women undergoing laparotomy. However, atypical endometriosis is rare. It is characterized histologically by endometriotic glands with cytologic and/or architectural atypia. Method: The incidence of ovarian atypical endometriosis (AEM) in a consecutive series of cases during the period 2013 to 2016 was studied The diagnosis of atypical endometriosis was based on the presence of large hyperchromatic or pale nuclei with moderate to marked pleomorphism; increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio; and cellular crowding, stratification, or tufting. Three or more of these criteria must be present. Results: 6 cases of atypical endometriosis were found in a series of 175 typical endometriosis (3,5 %), 5 were in the ovary and 1 in the fallopian tube.Of the ovary AEMs, 3 were associated with a borderline or malignant tumour, 1 was associated with teratoma. Conclusion: The ovary is the most common site for development of malignancy in endometriosis; however, little is known about the incidence of ovarian atypical endometriosis and its association with ovarian malignant epithelial tumours The process of damage, repair, and scarring over a long period may play a role in the development of endometriosis into AEM and eventually into tumour formation. Objective: To investigate expression anti-viral receptors of innate immunity NOD1, TLR9 in the structural elements of placenta and myometrium samples in patients with severe preeclampsia. Method: The immunohistological study was performed on the 15 serial paraffin slices of placenta and myometrium: 9 samples collected from women with severe preeclampsia (PE), 6 samples-with normal pregnancy (NP), using NOD1 primary monoclonal antibodies (1:100; Termo scientific), TLR9 (1:500; Genetex). The intensity of immunohistochemical reaction was estimated by means of Nikon Eclipse microscope imaging software (NIS-Elements). Results: The immunohistochemical study indicated NOD1 and TLR9 cytoplasmic staining in amnion, major and minor subset of decidual cells, syncytiotrophoblast, syncytial knots, cells of stroma, endothelium of vessels of placental villi. NOD1 demonstrated more intensive staining in syncytiotrophoblast and endothelium of stem and intermediate placental villi in women with NP, than with PE (p < 0,05)(0,46 \u00b1 0,052, 0,40 \u00b1 0,043 and 0,45 \u00b1 0,24; 0,36 \u00b1 0,038, respectively). We observed irregular with marked fluctuations TLR9 expression staining in syncytiotrophoblast and endothelium of placental villi in preeclamptic women than in NP. In PE NOD1 and TLR9 demonstrated irregular expression of markers with significant variations in neighboring cells in myometrium. Conclusion: Disturbance of innate immunity receptors expression (NOD1, TLR9) both in placenta and myometrium associated in severe PE. Objective: To study distribution of cervical lesions diagnosed by pap smear in Tunisian population in which cervical cancer incidence is known to be low. Method: A retrospective study with analysis of results in pap smears with epithelial cell abnormalities. Results: Out of 44,057 pap smears, 247 cases (0,6 %) demonstrated epithelial abnormalities. Patients' age ranged from 22 to 77 years (mean age = 48). Reporting of the slides was done according to the 2014 Bethesda system and results were as follows: Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) was seen in 37 (15 %), atypical squamous cells that cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) in 13 (5 %), low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in 43 (18 %), high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) in 37 (15 %), squamous cell carcinoma in 68 (28 %), Atypical glandular cells (AGC) in 33 (13 %) and adenocarcinoma in 16 (6 %) cases. Conclusion: In our study, less than 1 % of all pap smears contained epithelial cell abnormalities. This could be explained by the low incidence of cervical cancer in our country. It has been shown that about two thirds of cervical cytology were for malignant and premalignant lesions and one third for undetermined lesions. Objective: We investigated the expression of ER, PR, Her2/neu, Ki67 in 38 cases of endometrial carcinomas (EC) from Egyptian patients to evaluate the correlation with histopathologic features, in an attempt to sub classify endometrial carcinoma based on molecular parameters.",

Results: ER was detected in 45 % of cases and significantly associated with old age, absence of necrosis and absence of associated hyperplasia (P = 0.022, 0.012 and 0.034, respectively). PR positivity was determined in 58 % of cases and was significantly associated with old age, infiltrative pattern of invasion and cervical invasion (P = 0.031, 0.037 and 0.026 respectively). Her2/neu was expressed in 5 % of cases. Low expression of Ki67 was encountered in 37 % of cases while 63 % exhibited high Ki67 labelling index. PR and ER expressions in endometrial carcinoma cases were significantly correlated (P = 0.005). On the other hand, neither PR nor ER expression was significantly associated with Her2/neu or Ki67 expression in endometrial carcinoma. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical markers should be thoroughly investigated and considered as reliable parameters in the selection of hormonal or targeted therapy for endometrial carcinoma. Objective: Carcinogenic pathways in ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas are a problem of debate in gynecological pathology. We intended a contributive study to the panel of information for this malignant tumour. Method: We performed a 5-year retrospective study of 85 ovarian highgrade serous carcinomas registered at Victor Babes National Institute of Pathology. We analyzed patients' age, clinical history, histopathological features and immunohistochemistry expression for WT1, p53, ER, PR, Ki67, VIM, CK7, CK20, CEA, VIM, CA125. Results: The mean age of patients was 58 years old. 4 patients had bilateral tumours and 6 presented with extrapelvic peritoneal extension. Positivity for WT1 was focal in 6 cases of 77 (8 %) and diffuse for the rest; p53 wild pattern expression was noticed in 12 of 27cases (44 %); PR was positive in 30 of 51 cases (59 %); Ki67 > 60 % was observed in 24 of 60 cases (40 %); VIM was positive in 7 of 21 cases (33 %). We had one case of CK7 negative and two cases of CEA focally positive. Conclusion: We found higher percentages of p53 expression of wild pattern type (not associated with TP53 mutation) and PR positivity than other data in the literature. Our study emphasizes the high variability of this type of malignancy and that further studies are still necessary in understanding its biology and molecular mechanisms.",

Andrei * Emergency University Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, Romania Objective: We report the case of a 47 year-old woman with bilateral tubal high-grade serous carcinoma forming large intraluminal masses associated with serous intraepithelial lesions which is a rare finding in pathology practice. Method: The patient previously diagnosed with HSIL, presented with normocytic anemia and abnormal vaginal bleeding and discharge and underwent total hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy. Both fallopian tubes were dilated at their fimbriated end (maximum 7 cm in diameter) and were intraoperatively mistaken for hematosalpinx. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry tests were performed. Results: Histopathological examination revealed bilateral intraluminal masses with parietal invasion and serous tubal intraepithelial lesions consistent with primary bilateral tubal high-grade serous carcinoma with extension to the ovaries (pT2a), intramural uterine leiomyoma, HSIL of the uterine cervix. Immunohistochemistry results of the tumour specimen: WT1 positive, p53 moderate nuclear expression in 40 % tumour cell nuclei, ER positive 20 %, PR negative, AR negative, CD44 patchy positive and predominant in cells at the subepithelial invasion front, Ki67 proliferation index of 50 %. Conclusion: Diagnosis of primary high-grade serous carcinoma of the fallopian tube can be challenging especially when ovarian involvement is present. Thus, careful examination in search of evident invasion from intraluminal mass and associated tubal intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma is necessary for making the correct statement. Objective: Effects of photoperiodism alteration on reproductive cycle have become widely reecognized, involving a distinct oxidative damage. Oxidative stress, based on the excessive production of reactive oxygen species, alters the ovulation and the ovarian integrity. Our study defines the relationship between the extent of the oxidative stress and its impact on ovarian histomorphology in rats as a result of light/ dark cycle alteration. Method: Female Wistar rats aged 7 weeks were randomly divided in two groups, a control group kept under conditions of controlled temperature (22-24\u00b0C) and a 12:24 light/dark cycle and an experimental group, maintained on a continuous light exposure during the whole experiment. Appropriate markers were chosen in order to analyse the extent of the oxidative stress(SOD, CAT, MDA); histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry study of monoclonal anti-8 Hydroxiguanosine antibody(8-OHdG) were realized to determine the ovarian oxidative impact. Results: We identified a high ovarian 8-OHdG immunoexpression level, together with significant increased follicular atresia, alteration of follicular development stages, apoptotic and degenerative processes, inhibitory action on thecal cells and affected oocyte quality. Conclusion: Light/dark cycle alteration is responsible for oxidative alteration in the rat ovary. Objective: Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at stage of peritoneal seeding. Accurate diagnosis of peritoneal extension has paramount prognostic implication. Irritation of the peritoneum may lead to the presence of reactive mesothelial cells and make the diagnosis more difficult with metastatic ovarian cancer. PAX8 was found to be frequently expressed in primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma and increased the overall detection rate of metastatic ovarian carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to compare the immunostaining of PAX8 in malignant peritoneal effusion containing cells considered as coming from serous carcinoma of the ovary and the original tumour. Method: Retrospective anti-Pax8 immunostaining of 27 specimens (16 tissue blocks, 9 cell blocks and 5 cytocentrifugation slides, destained and immunostained) was performed. Results: . Detections rate of Pax8 was 100 % (16/16) of paraffin embedded serous carcinoma of the ovary, while detection rate in cell blocks and cytocentrifuge was 86 % (9/11).",

Objective: To describe a case of uterine inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) with unusual histological features, aggressive clinical course and fatal outcome. Method: A 61 year old woman presented with a 10 cm uterine mass and extensive extrauterine disease. The uterine tumour had a multinodular appearance with areas of necrosis. The tumour exhibited varied morphology with cellular areas of spindle cell proliferation in a myxoid stroma as well as sheets of highly pleomorphic epithelioid cells with vesicular nuclei, large nucleoli and abundant amphophilic to eosinophilic cytoplasm mimicking anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Tumour cell necrosis and frequent mitoses including, atypical mitotic figures were found. The tumour showed strong ALK expression by immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for ALK gene rearrangement was positive in the tumour. The patient died of disease within 3 months of presentation. Conclusion: IMT of the female genital tract are rare and diagnostically challenging. These tumours are frequently under recognized and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mesenchymal tumours of the female genital tract. It is critical to recognize these tumours especially the aggressive forms given the recent development of a novel ALK-targeted therapy, which may have a role in managing aggressive cases.",

            "text": "Objective: To describe the incidental discovery of bilateral gonadal malignancy in a young female presenting with amenorrhea and to review the literature on these malignancies. Method: An 18 year old female was being investigated for primary amenorrhea. Hormone analysis revealed high levels of leuteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and low levels of oestradiol and progesterone. Ultrasound assessment showed bilateral atrophic ovaries. Menarch was induced with norethisterone but menstruation was irregular and ceased shortly after treatment withdrawal. Genetic analysis revealed a 46XY karyotype and hence, prophylactic bilateral salpingo\u00f6phorectomy was performed. Both ovaries had a speckled calcified cut surface and soft white nodules were visualised bilaterally. Histology showed an infiltrative dysgerminoma arising in a background calcified gonadoblastoma in both ovaries. The ovarian parenchyma was heavily calcified and no primordial follicle formation could be defined. Results: The patient is well and is undergoing treatment with bleomycinetoposide-cisplatin chemotherapy. Conclusion: Bilateral dysgerminomas arising in gonadoblastomas are exceedingly rare malignancies and occur almost exclusively in cases of ovarian dysgensis, particularly in the presence of the gonadoblastoma locus-harbouring Y-chromosome. They carry an excellent prognosis if caught early and prophylactic o\u00f6phorectomy is suggested in such cases. Objective: Ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours are rare and usually are unilateral with a median age of less than 30 years at presentation. Functionally; they are classified into three groups based on hormonal secretions; Androgen, estrogen and no endocrine activity. Alpha fetoprotein is associated with germ cell neoplasms particularly yolk sac tumour. Method: Here we present a case of a 27 year old female with huge left ovarian mass and mildly elevated Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP), diagnosed as intermediate to poorly differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour with minor germ cell component. AFP staining was negative in most of the tumour except in small glands in a single focus (2 \u00d7 1 mm) which was also positive for glypican-3 and SALL-4, thus representing a small focus of yolk sac tumour, the source of AFP. Results: Review of literature revealed only 30 cases associated with elevated AFP. We suggest that cases of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours with elevated AFP must be examined thoroughly with multiple levels for small foci of yolk sac tumour, which may be the source of AFP elevation. Conclusion: We suggest that cases of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumours with elevated AFP must be examined thoroughly with multiple levels for small foci of yolk sac tumour, which may be the source of AFP elevation. Objective: Glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) is a membrane glycoprotein responsible for the regulation of glucose uptake. Increased expression of Glut-1 seems to be an important not only as a cell Objective: We present a case of androgen-secreting stromal luteoma of the ovary in a patient of 41 years old with clinical manifestations of virilization. Results: 41 year old woman presenting 6 month of progressive virilization and amonorreha and high serum levels of testosterone. A left oophorectomy was performed making the diagnosis of a 1.8 cm Stromal Luteoma. After surgery the testosterone serum level decreased and virilization manifestations gradually disappear. Conclusion: Steroid cell tumours account for 0.1 % of all ovarian neoplasms and 20 % of them correspond to benign stromal luteoma. An important feature of this tumour is its hormonal secretion and only 12 % are associated with androgenic manifestations. The microscopic examination of these tumours must include an exhaustive study to discard the presence of crystals of Reinke. It is important to not make an equivocal diagnosis of steroid cell tumour not otherwise specified which can have a malignant behavior and a worst prognosis, with presence of extraovarian disease in the momento of diagnosis in some cases. Histologically these lesions should be differentiated from pregnancy luteoma, clear cell carcinoma, hepatoid carcinoma, luteinized thecoma, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Objective: Classical factors as histomorphology, grade, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (FIGO stage) and residual tumour size have prognostic value in advanced epithelial ovarian carcinomas (AEOC). AEOCs have poor overall survival (OS), and early recurrence rate. Despite poor prognosis and advanced stage at time of diagnosis in particular cases long-term survival (LTS) was observed. We have studied how classical prognostic factors and molecular factors as \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin, MiB-1, p53 predict long-term survival. Method: The expression of \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin, MiB-1, p53 proteins was determined immunohistochemically, with Tissue Microarray (TMA) technic. The effect of protein expressions and classical factors on overall survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional-hazards model. Results: Residual tumour size as classical marker was observed as adverse independent prognostic factor for OS supporting previous observations (p = 0.003). Nuclear expression of \u03b2-catenin was observed as an independent favourable predictor for LTS (p = 0.025). Additionally strong correlation was found between nuclear \u03b2-catenin expression and sensitivity or re-induction of platinum therapy. Conclusion: Nuclear \u03b2-catenin expression has significant correlation with LTS and has important role in platinum sensitivity. Moreover is supports the possibility of platinum re-induction in AEOC. Objective: Decidual cell groups outside the endometrium are named ectopic decidua or deciduosis, this condition can be seen rarely on the peritoneum during laparotomy for a cesarean section for pregnancy. Deciduosis is a benign transient condition, most commonly localized in the ovary, cervix and uterine serosa while the peritoneal localization is rare. It generally has no clinical symptoms; it therefore requires no therapeutic intervention. Method: A 30-year-old woman G1P0 asymptomatic underwent cesarean section at 39 weeks gestation. The laparotomy revealed greyish-yellow soft nodules on the parietal peritoneum. On histologic examination, the lesion was composed of large polygonal decidualized cells with abundant eosinophilic focally vacualated cytoplasm. The nuclei were regular with fine chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Results: Decidual cells showed immunoreactivity for vimentin, D-240 and progesterone receptor; CK EA1/EA3 (+ mesothelial cells). And negativity for: Calretinin, CK 5/6, S-100, HMB-45, EMA and CEA. Conclusion: -Pregnancy-related peritoneal deciduosis develops as a result of metaplasia of subserosal stromal cells with the effect of the progesterone hormone during pregnancy and it regresses within the 4-6 weeks duration after pregnancy with decidual involution. -Immunohistochemistry may help the differential diagnosis of peritoneal deciduosis where problems are experienced differentiating the case from malignant mesothelioma, metastatic carcinoma or melanoma. Objective: To describe a case of vulvovaginal cellular pseudosarcomatous fibroepithelial stromal polyp (CPFSP) associated to invasive squamous cell carcinoma in a post-menopausal woman. Method: A 83-year-old woman presented with a 6 cm vulvovaginal polypoid mass that underwent biopsy, followed shortly by an \"explosive\" recurrence. A left vulvectomy was performed. To date neither recurrences nor metastasis have been detected. Results: Histology revealed a polypoid ulcerated heterogeneous neoplasm. The stromal component consisted of a patternless, densely cellular, mitotically active proliferation of fusiform or stellated cells with markedly pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei in a myxoid or variabily collagenized matrix with necrotic foci. Immunohistochemically these cells were positive for vimentin, actin and CD10 and negative for cytokeratins, EMA, CEA, estrogen and progesterone receptors, desmin, S100, CD34, CD31 and p16. Overexpression of p53 was observed. The epithelial component consisted of an infiltrating, moderately-differentiated, keratinising squamous cell carcinoma with in situ component. Conclusion: Although concomitant hyperplastic-dysplastic changes of the epithelial surface have been described in CPFSP, to our knowledge an association with invasive carcinoma, that can lead to misdiagnosis of carcinosarcoma, has not been reported. A hypotetical relationship with overexpression of p53, not previously evaluated in these neoplasms, is considered. Objective: Chemotherapy is a common type of preoperative neoadjuvant treatment and postoperative adjuvant or palliative therapy for many different types of malignancy. Certain chemotherapeutic agents can induce bizarre epithelial atypia that mimics malignancy. Unfamiliarity with these changes could potentially cause confusion with a neoplastic or infectious process. The endometrium is one of the few sites where chemotherapyinduced epithelial atypia has not been appreciated. Method: We identified four patients with marked cytologic atypia of the endometrial glandular epithelium from the surgical pathology files of the Severance Hospital. The medical records of these patients were reviewed. All patients underwent hysteroscopic examination with endometrial curettage for investigation of vaginal bleeding. They had previously undergone chemotherapy for uterine cervical cancer (n = 1), rectal cancer (n = 2) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1). The chemotherapy regimens included alkylating agents (busulfan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, cisplatin and oxaliplatin), pyrimidine antagonists (capecitabine, decitabine and 5-fluorouracil), taxane (paclitaxel) and topoisomerase inhibitors (irinotecan and etoposide). Results: Histopathologically, the atypical epithelial changes included marked nuclear enlargement and pleomorphism, degenerative-looking chromatin pattern, microvacuolation of abundant cytoplasm and preservation of nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that certain chemotherapeutic agents may cause bizarre, reactive atypia of the endometrial glandular epithelium. These changes should not be interpreted as neoplastic or infectious in nature. An awareness of prior exposure to cytotoxic agents, and a familiarity with the nature and distribution of these bizarre alterations is essential to avoiding misinterpretation of the morphologic features and preventing unnecessary treatment. Objective: Psammocarcinoma is a rare form of serous carcinoma that can arise from the ovaries or peritoneum. It is characterized by massive psammoma body formation, invasion to surrounding structures and low grade cytologic features. Method: We report a case of a 60-year-old hysterectomized woman who presented with ascites and raised CA-125 level. On microscopic examination, the cytologic findings in ThinPrep and cell-block of peritoneal washing were three-dimensional papillary columnar cell groups with l o w g r a d e c y t o l o g i c a t y p i a a n d p s a m m o m a b o d i e s . Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for WT-1, Estrogene, Ca-125, MOC-31, TAG-72, negative for Calretinin, D2-40, CDX2, TTF-1. After that, the paraffin blocks of the patient which was diagnosed as endosalpingiosis is re-evaluated in our pathology department. Results: Histological examination of paraffin block revealed tumour with numerous psammoma bodies with occasional small epithelial clusters between psammoma bodies on the surface of both bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes. Neoplastic epithelial cells showed mild-moderate cytological atypia. Conclusion: Psammomatous calcification is associated with benign and malignant pathology in different organ system including the gynaecological tract. The condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Clinical behavior is similar to borderline serous tumours with a favorable prognosis.",

Method: Paired urine and cervical samples were collected during the follow-up of women who had a previous positive HPV test. HPV testing was performed using Cobas 4800 HPV test. Results: Paired urine and cervical samples were obtained from 168 women. The rate of invalid testing was higher in urine samples than in cervical samples (26.8 versus 0.6 %, p < 0.001). Among 123 paired samples with valid test results, 24 were HPV-positive in both samples, 11 in cervical samples only, and 6 in urine samples only. Using HPV detection in cervical samples as a reference, the sensitivity of urine HPV testing was 68.9 %, specificity; 93.2 %, positive predictive value; 80.0 %, and negative predictive value; 88.1 %. In 24 HPV-positive paired samples, 22 (91.7 %) had concordant genotyping results provided by Cobas test. Objective: A fibroma is a benign stromal tumour composed of spindled to ovoid fibroblastic cells producing collagen. About 10 % of fibromas are densely cellular but exhibit no more than mild aytpia. These are referred to as cellular fibromas. In 2014 World Health Organization(WHO) histological classification, mitotic activity of >4 per 10HPF in an ovarian cellular fibromatous neoplasm in the absence of moderate to severe atypia is defined as mitotically active cellular fibroma(MACF). Method: A 42-year-old women presented with adnexial mass. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, with a 11 \u00d7 9.5 \u00d7 8 cm mass being disclosed from the right ovary. Macroscopically, the tumour was firm, fibrous, well delimited, yellow-white without gross necrosis. Histologically, it was composed of a densely cellular proliferation of fibrolastic-like cells with bland nuclear features and arranged in a fascicular pattern. There was no significant atypia or necrosis. Mitotic index was 7/10HPFs. The spindle cells were positive for SMA while the kaldesmon was negative. Ki67 proliferative index of tumour was determined as 2 %. Results: MACFs are in general associated with favorable outcome, but they may recur especially with rupture, adherence, or difficult dissection. Thus, long-term clinical follow-up is recommended. Conclusion: MACF is a recent histopathologic entity and should be distinguished from ovarian fibrosarcoma. Objective: Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumours(ES/ PNET) are high-grade malignant neoplasms that typically arise within the skeletal system. Primary extraskeletal ES/PNETs are uncommon and have been reported in various sites, the most frequent being the chest wall, lower extremities, and the paravertebral region. Few cases of primary vulvar of ES/PNET have been published before. Method: A 27-year-old patient presented with 3 cm solid mass located on her right labium minus. The pathological evaluation revealed a malignant neoplasm with nodular growth pattern in a fibrous background. The cells had uniform round nuclei, coarse chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and eosinophilic or clear scanty cytoplasm. The brisk mitotic activity and necrosis were observed. PAS staining showed cytoplasmic positivity in neoplastic cells. In the immunohistochemical analysis, the cells exhibited diffuse-positive membrane staining with CD99, vimentin, NSE, Bcl-2 while the HMB45, CK20, CK7, EMA, S100, TTF-1, LCA, TdT, desmin and myogenin were negative. We could not applied Fli-1. There was no tumour in other regions by whole-body scan. The patient did not receive any treatment. Results: She is still alive with stable disease after 1 year of follow up. Conclusion: Based on the literature, it appears that extraskeletalES/ PNET arising in superficial sites such as the vulva have better prognosis. Objective: An important prognostic factor for endometrial cancer is the degree of myometrial invasion. In the absence of deep myometrial invasion, lymph node metastasis is very low. Method: Thestudyincludedallcasesoftotalhysterectomywithpelviclymph node dissection performed between 01/01/10 and 31/12/2013 at Royal Surrey County Hospital. Histology data regarding the histological type, grade, depth of myometrial invasion, presence/ absence of lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis, and stage of disease was obtained from Winpath database. Correlation was made with depth of invasion and lymphadenopathy documented in the radiology reports where available. Results: Of the 98 cases analysed, 7(7.1 %) showed lymph node metastasis. Six out of seven (86 %) of the lymph node positive cases were grade 3 carcinomas involving outer half of the myometrium with lymphovascular invasion. Of the 47 cases (48 %) available for radiological correlation, 27 (57 %) showed concordance with regards to FIGO stage. Conclusion: Lower grade endometrial cancers and those with no or less than 50 % myometrial invasions are unlikely to have lymph node metastasis. However, the best predictor of this pre-operatively is accurate staging of endometrial cancers on imaging. Further detailed evaluation is necessary to improve pathological-radiological concordance. Objective: While the true incidence remains undetermined, arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the uterus is a rare entity that is potentially life-threatening from massive hemorrhage. Uterine AVM can be either congenital or acquired with the latter being more frequent and often preceded by uterine trauma including artificial abortions via dilatation and curettage, surgeries, cesarean delivery, trophoblastic diseases, endometrial and cervical carcinomas and infections. Patients with acquired AVM usually present with menorrhagia or menometrorrhagia following a miscarriage or recurrent pregnancy loss. Stromomyoma, also known as endometrial stromal tumour with smooth muscle cell differentiation, is another rare entity of the uterus. Uterine AVM associated with benign mesenchymal tumour is very rarely reported. Conclusion: We report a 45-year old woman who was initially diagnosed with a 10 cm leiomyoma. She presented to the clinic for menorrhagia for 4 years. Dysmenorrhea accompanied the profuse menorrhagia. She had a parity of 2-0-2-2 with 2 natural abortions. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a 10 cm mass at the anterior wall of the uterus, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the same mass with strong heterogeneous enhancement protruding from myometrium into uterine cavity suspicious of a submucosal leiomyoma Postoperative pathologic examination revealed AVM arising in a stromomyoma. Physical examination revealed blood clots and tissue fragments protruding from the external os, which were sent to pathological analysis. After the initial diagnosis the patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Results: Gross examination showed a polypoid neoplasm with 2,4 \u00d7 1,2 cm, located in the uterine corpus. Microscopically, the tumour was biphasic with a benign epithelial component scattered among a malignant stromal component. The later showed typical periglandular cuffing and focal formation of polypoid fronds that projected into glands. Objective: Heterotopic adrenal cortex is a rare entity usually discovered in male infants, around the kidney, retroperitoneum, spermatic cord or in the para-testicular area. There is little information about adults with ectopic adrenal glans in the scientific literature. Incidence in females is noticeably lower and occasionally identified in hysterectomy specimens. Method: We report a series of 3 cases of postmenopausal females ages 66, 67 and 76 years, histopathologically diagnosed with endometrial cancer. All women presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding and underwent endometrial biopsy followed by radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and regional lymph node excision. Results: A though histopathological analysis of the three hysterectomy specimens established the diagnoses of well and moderately differentiated endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, stages pT1bN0M0 and pT2N0M0 respectively, as well as carcinosarcoma of the uterine corpus, stage pT1cN0M0. Sections from the fallopian tubes of all three women revealed well encapsulated ectopic adrenal cortical rests of various sizes, located in the paratubal region. Conclusion: We report this series of cases due to the rarity of ectopic adrenal tissue in females, its interesting presentation in association with unrelated gynaecological pathology, as well as its potential complications and possibility for malignant transformation. Objective: Cervical cancer is caused by the sexually transmitted Human Papilloma virus (HPV) which is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract. Long standing infection with specific types of HPV (especially types 16 and 18) may lead to pre-invasive lesions. Recently, attention has been focused on p16 and Ki67 as biomarkers with potential utility in the identification pre-invasive cervical lesions. Method: We assessed the application of p16 in the detection of preinvasive cervical lesions on cervical samples seen in our department in 2012 and 2013. Results: The age range of the subjects was from 24 to 76 years with a mean age of 42 years. The initial diagnosis were as follows: chronic nonspecific cervicitis:38.5 %, CIN1: 23.1 %, CIN2: 7.7 %, CIN3: 11.5 %, CIS: 7.7 %, moderate dysplasia: 3.8 % and normal cervix: 7.7 %. After p16 staining, 76.9 % were interpreted as negative for p16, atrophy 3.8 %, CIN1 7.7 %, CIN2 7.7 % and CIN3 3.8 %.",

            "text": "Conclusion: We conclude that p16 is of great importance especially in differentiating between reactive/chronically inflamed cervix and CIN and also in differentiating between the various stages of CIN. We propose that with the limited resources available, p16 staining should be done after peer review of cervical biopsies that are suspicious on H&E. Objective: Malignant mixed mullerian tumours are a rare histologic subtype of ovarian cancer composed of an admixture of both malignant epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Its infrequency and aggressiveness make this subtype interesting to know. Method: We report a case of a 59 year old woman, who presented with abdominal pain. The CT scan showed a solidocystic latero-uterine mass extended to the sigmoid. Histology combined to immunochemistry showed an admixture of malignant epithelial and stromal elements. The malignant epithelial element was a high grade endometroid carcinoma. The stromal component was a chondrosarcoma. Results: Malignant mixed mullerian tumour is a rare histologic subtype diagnosed in 1-4 % of all ovarian cancer survivors. It is an aggressive tumour occurring in postmenopausal, often diagnosed in advanced stages. The clinical presentation is similar to ovarian epithelial tumours. On imaging, it is not possible to differentiate it from other ovarian neoplasms; therefore the diagnosis is essentially based on histopathologic findings. In addition to conventional histology, immunohistochemistry is an essential low cost ancillary technique in highlighting biphasic nature and areas of heterologous differentiation which may have a prognostic impact. Conclusion: This case illustrates a rare tumour that should be distinguished from other forms of ovarian carcinomas because of its ominous prognosis. Objective: Imaging-guided omental biopsy(IGOB) is commonly used to diagnose advanced stage malignancy. Data on diagnostic findings in IGOB are scant and our impression is that primary site and subtype information is non-specific. As the specific diagnosis of extrauterine high grade serous carcinoma(HGSC) has therapeutic, prognostic and genetic implications, we particularly wished to establish the frequency of HGSC and thus potentially guide appropriate immunohistochemistry(IHC). Method: 84 consecutive reports (In-house = 60, referral = 24) of malignant female IGOB (March 2013-December 2015) were retrieved and relevant data (clinical,IHC,diagnosis) collated. Results: The pre-test probability(PTP) of HGSC in female IGOB was high with a final HGSC diagnosis in 57 cases(68 %), rising to 77 % in patients with no prior histologic diagnosis of malignancy. Historic or nonspecific terminologies were common including; papillary serous carcinoma(18 %), ovarian adenocarcinoma(12 %). The remainder of diagnoses comprised a miscellany of primary sites, with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma comprising 5 cases. Conclusion: The majority of malignancies in female IGOB were HGSC with the frequency of this diagnosis being over 10-fold that of any other malignancy. Awareness of this finding may assist the general pathologist to avoid non-specific diagnoses and deploy a more targeted IHC panel ab initio (such as WT1, P53, PAX-8, P16) in the setting of a malignant IGOB.",

            "text": "Objective: Extrauterine endometrial stromal sarcoma, also known as endometrioid stromal sarcoma, represents a rare occurrence, with less than 100 cases reported. This neoplasm is frequently associated with endometriosis and may involve the ovaries, fallopian tube, vagina, bowel wall, pelvic cavity, abdominal cavity and retroperitoneum. Method: We present the case of a 65 years old woman with a large pelvic tumour, 113/72/60 mm and secondary grade IV ureterohydronephrosis. Fourteen years before the patient underwent hysterectomy for cervical squamous cell carcinoma followed by radiotherapy and the pelvic lesion was clinically considered tumour recurrence. Results: Microscopic examination of the pelvic mass revealed a hypercellular diffuse and vague-fascicular proliferation of mildly atypical spindle cells with stromal arterioles, stromal hyalinization areas and cystic spaces. The tumour presented hypocellular areas towards the periphery. The tumour cells were positive for vimentin, CD10, WT1, CD56, synaptophisin, CD99 and desmin and negative for cytokeratins. A final diagnosis of high grade extrauterine endometrial stromal sarcoma was rendered. Conclusion: The diagnosis of an extrauterine endometrial stromal sarcoma is challenging, requiring clinical-pathological correlations and exclusion of a primary uterine lesion, of other more frequent types of sarcoma and exclusion of sarcomatoid carcinoma. Objective: We report a case of pure large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ovary in 32-years old woman. Her past medical history includes juvenile granulosa cell tumour of the left ovary, she presented with a pelvic mass measuring 10 cm in diameter. Method: the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for resection of the right palpable adnexal mass. Results: Histologically, the tumour is composed of islands, nests and cords separated by a thin stroma. The cells are medium to large in size with hyperchromatic and nucleoli with numerous mitoses. Immunohistochemicaly, the tumour cells are positive for EMA, synaptophysin, chromogranin A and CD56, and negative for inhibin and calretinin. Conclusion: Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the ovary is a rare and aggressive tumour, frequently associated with ovarian surface epithelial tumours. The prognosis of LCNECs is generally very poor even when the diagnosis is made at an early stage. Only 9 cases of pure large cells neuroendocrine carcinoma have been reported in the literature. On laparotomy, the mass was found to be of ovarian origin. A left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Results: On gross examination, the ovary measured 38 \u00d7 38 \u00d7 20 cm and had a firm smooth surface. On cut section, it was solid and cystic. Microscopic examination of the tumour showed an adenofibromatous pattern. The epithelial component was made of mildly crowded glands that had focal moderate cytologic atypia and epithelial stratification. The stromal component was fibrotic, without cytonuclear atypia. On immunohistochemistry (IHC), the epithelial component was positive with CK7 and EMA. The tumour cells did not stain with CD10 and \u03b1-inhibin. A diagnosis of a borderline endometrioid tumour developed on an adenofibroma was retained. Conclusion: Ovarian endometrioid adenofibroma of borderline malignancy is a rare tumour that often requires proper sampling and IHC for the correct diagnosis. Pathologists should be aware of this entity such as not to misdiagnose it as a malignant tumour. Objective: To present the case of a patient who had an ovarian fibroma associated to peritoneal tuberculosis that was clinically misdiagnosed as an advanced ovarian cancer. To discuss means of differentiating peritoneal tuberculosis from advanced ovarian cancer in light of literature data. Method: A 65-year-old woman presented with progressive abdominal distension. Abdominopelvic MRI showed an ovarian heterogeneous mass suspicious for malignancy. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, a 10 cm ovarian tumour was found, with peritoneal seedings that were misdiagnosed as carcinomatosis. A bilateral salpingooophorectomy was performed. Results: On gross examination, the right ovary measured 10,5 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 5 cm, had a firm consistency, a whitish cut surface with myxoid change. There was miliary seedings scattered over the surfaces of the two ovaries and fallopian tubes. Histologic examination showed a spindle cell proliferation on the right ovary, morphologically consistent with an ovarian fibroma. This was associated to extensive granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid cells and typical multinucleated giant cells of Langhans type,involving bilateral adnexa. The diagnosis of an ovarian fibroma associated to peritoneal tuberculosis was made. Conclusion: The treatment of peritoneal tuberculosis is based on medical therapy, it is therefore important to take tuberculosis into account when treating women with massive ascites and adnexal tumours in order to avoid unnecessary extensive surgery. We suggest exploratory laparotomy and intraoperative frozen pathology for the diagnosis of pelvic tuberculosis. Objective: Glassy cell carcinoma (GCC) was first described in the uterine cervix. Although uterine cervix is the most frequent site for this tumour, less than 1 % of cervical tumours are GCCs. Also, it has been described in endometrium, fallopian tubes, vagina, and colon. The incidence of GCC is extremely rare, only 14 cases have been reported in the English literature. Method: A 63-year-old woman, referred to gynecology clinic due to postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. After the diagnostic curettage, surgical staging has been performed. Macroscopic examination of the endometrial cavity showed no prominent residual mass, except for focal irregular areas. Right ovarian cut surface showed nodular solid area that was suspicious for metastasis. Only one right pelvic lymph node was invaded by tumour. Other organs were unremarkable. Results: Microscopic examination of endometrial curettage, focal tumour limited to the endometrium, ovary, and lymph node revealed solid irregular nests of large pleomorphic cells with moderate to abundant finely granular cytoplasm. Tumour cells nests were separated by fibrovascular septa with dense inflammatory background composed predominantly of plasma cells with an admixture of neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes. Conclusion: Although cervical GCC has poor prognosis, the prognosis of its endometrial counterpart is unknown. But it seems to have an aggressive behavior. Objective: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare progressive disease that tends to affect young women of child-bearing age and is characterized by cystic destruction of the lung due to the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Extrapulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis may or may not be associated with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis and/or tuberous sclerosis complex. Here we present a case of lymph node lymphangioleiomyomatosis detected incidentally during surgical staging o f o v a r y c a r c i n o m a , n o t a s s o c i a t e d w i t h p u l m o n a r y lymphangioleiomyomatosis or tuberous sclerosis. Method: A 51 year-old woman diagnosed with endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary underwent an elective pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection. Results: As an incidental histological finding, some lymph nodes revealed a proliferation of myoid-appearing spindle cells arranged in intersecting fascicles disposed around irregular vascular spaces lined by flattened endothelial cells. No cellular atypia or mitotic activity was observed. Inmunohistochemistry revealed that cells showed expression for smooth muscle actin, desmin, focally for HMB-45, MITF, estrogen receptors and the D2-40 staining highlighted the endothelial cells revealing lymphatic vascular nature. Conclusion: Clinically occult lymphangioleiomyomatosis can be detected during surgical staging of pelvic cancer and is not commonly associated with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis or tuberous sclerosis complex, although these patients should still be formally evaluated for both of these diseases. Objective: Hyperreactio luteinalis is a rare condition in which there is massive cystic enlargement of the ovaries mimicking malignancy during pregnancy. When confronted with this condition, the fear of missing a cancer diagnosis often leads the physician to react with unnecessary surgical intervention, potentially resulting in impaired future fertility. The purpose of this study is to emphasize the importance of recognizing the clinicopathological features of this tumour. Method: We report two cases with hyperreactio luteinalis. Clinical data and microscopic slides were reviewed. Results: They were two women aged 33 years old. The first patient presented at 39 weeks of gestation in labour and underwent a caesarean section. In a systematic exploration of the annexes, bilateral, enlarged cystic ovaries were seen. The cysts were thinwalled and without vegetations. Ovarian biopsy was performed showing cysts with regular luteinized cells within the wall and no histological evidence of malignancy, consisting with a diagnosis of hyperreactio luteinalis. In the second case, a left ovary cyst was fortuitously discovered during the first quarter ultrasound. Conservative treatment was done in the two cases. Conclusion: Management of hyperreactio luteinalis must be conservative and continued education of health care professionals who may encounter this entity is vital. Objective: A 27-year-old nulliparous patient consulted for vulvo-vajinal pain, bleeding and dysuria. On physical examination a soft bleeding mass filling the distal posterior vaginal wall was detected. Computerized tomography results showed a heterogenous mass of 15 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 10 cm which contain necrotic and cystic foci that is indistinguishable from the isthmus and cervix uteri. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and partial vaginectomy. Method: On gross examination, the mass composed of solid, necrotic and cystic areas. Microscopically the vaginal epithelium lined the external circumference of the nodule which composed of endometrial stromal cells. Mitotic activity was low and neither stromal nor lymphovascular invasion were detected. Results: \u0130mmunohistochemistry showed diffuse CD10 positivity by tumour cells. Desmin and caldesmon were negative. Conclusion: ESTs are usually uterin and myometrial lesions which can be intramural, subserozal and submucosal. Vagina is a very rare location for ESTs. Diagnosis can be quite difficult especially in curettage speciments. Objective: Experimental models of endometriosis successfully reproduce human pathology, offering basic support in deciphering the particular dynamics of its components. This study focused on the surgical induction of endometriosis in rats by autotransplantation of uterine fragment in the abdominal wall, followed by a morphologic evaluation of changes that occur in responsiveness of vascular, glandular and stromal components of endometrial implant. Method: Endometriosis was surgically induced in Wistar female rats by suturing distal uterine horn autoimplants to the abdominal wall. After 60 days, the implants were prelevated together with fragments of normal uterine horn, paraffin embedding, H&E staining and examined under Nikon Eclipse 50i light microscope, for the description of the endometrial status. Results: Inflammatory areas were absent and the glandular proliferative processes were abundant, with no specific sensitivity endometrial variations. Angiogenic processes were detected together with some stromal proliferation. Conclusion: There were no significant differences between the autotransplanted and control endometrium, supporting the use of such experimental models in approaching the unsolved aspects of endometriosis. Objective: Ovarian cancer is the most sixth common cancer in women. In gynecologic cancers, it is the second most cancer after endometrial cancer and the most lethal cancer. FIGO stage, residue tumour after surgery, patient's age, histological type, grade, capsule rupture, peritoneal washing status are the prognostic factors. The aim of this study is to investigate estrogene, receptor(ER) progesterone receptor(PR), CerbB2, p53 and BRCA1 expressions and determine its prognostic value in ovarian cancer. Method: The study population was comprised 85 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who are diagnosed between 2002 and 2012. Immunohistochemical expression of ER, PR, CerbB2, P53 and BRCA1 and their relationship with clinicopathological parameters were evaluated. Results: In serous carcinomas (SC), there were significant correlations between ER expression with metastasis to fallopian tube, PR expression with patient's age, p53 expression with progression free survey (PFS) and cytoplasmic expression of BRCA1 with overall survey (OS) and PFS. There were significant differences with ER, PR and p53 expressions between type 1 and 2 tumours. In our study, PR and p53 were prognostic factors in SC. Conclusion: Large studies that contain more cases in each histological group are needed to determine the prognostic value of these five immunohistochemical markers.",

            "text": "Objective: Krukenberg tumour is a rare form of metastatic gastric signetring cell carcinoma. Thecomas rarely occur during pregnancy and represent approximately 1 % of all ovarian tumours. The phenomenon of tumour-to-tumour metastasis has been described in roughly 100 cases and, to the best of our knowledge, thecoma have never been reported as receiving tumour. We present a unique case of gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma metastatic to a luteinized thecoma in a pregnant woman. Method: During a routine ultrasound to a 28 year-old pregnant woman, on the 13th gestational week, an ovarian tumour was incidentally discovered; oophorectomy was performed. Results: Grossly, the ovary was 14 \u00d7 10.7 \u00d7 5 cm and 462.1 g, with a white, lobulated cut surface, cystic and fasciculate areas. Histologically, the bulk of the tumour was composed of uniform cells, with pale cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei, without atypia; infiltrating signet-ring cells were detected, exhibiting a characteristic immunostaining pattern of gastro-intestinal origin. A Krukenberg tumour on a luteinized thecoma was diagnosed; gastric biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of poorly cohesive carcinoma of signet-ring cell type. Conclusion: Tumour-to-tumour metastasis is a rare event; nevertheless, we should bear it in mind as it can explain the presence of an unusual cytological pattern in a specific tumour.",

            "text": "Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic value of Papanicolaou (PAP) smear and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) as methods of cervical cancer screening. Method: The study population consisted of women with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive carcinoma who had undergone prior PAP smear. Results: During the study period 160 patients underwent both PAP smear and cervical biopsy. Of these patients, 49 had a histological diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive carcinoma. The histopathological and cytological diagnoses were compared. VIA status was available for 31 of the 49 cases. The sensitivity of PAP smear was 61 %, specificity 97 %, positive predictive value (PPV) 91 %, negative predictive value (NPV) 85 % and diagnostic accuracy 86 % in detection of cervical neoplasia. VIA had a sensitivity of 74 %, specificity 48 %, PPV 64 %, NPV 60 % and diagnostic accuracy of 63 %. Combining the two procedures increased sensitivity by 26 %, NPV by 11 % and diagnostic accuracy by 2 %. Conclusion: PAP smear has a higher specificity, PPV, NPV and diagnostic accuracy but lower sensitivity than VIA. VIA by itself is not an effective screening method. A combination of PAP smear and VIA can ensure adequate screening of cervical neoplasia. Results: 523 (68%) of endometriotic foci were located in ovaries, 160 (21%) were extraovarian and 85 (11%) affected ovary and extraovarian sites. 27 tumours were recorded: 12 endometrioid (EC), 7 clear cell (CCC) carcinomas, 2 adenosarcomas (AS), one with sarcomatous overgrowth, 1 endometrioid stromal sarcoma (ESS), 2 seromucinous borderline (BDRL), 2 clear cell BDRL and 1 serous BDRL tumours; representing 3,5% of endometriosis. CCC cell and EC were the malignancies most commonly seen in ovaries containing endometriosis (17/ 21), while all AS and ESS were seen in conjunction with extraovarian endometriosis (3/6 extraovarian neoplasms). Conclusion: Several types of neoplasms can exhibit an association with endometriosis, stronger in CCC and EC, with a selected anatomical distribution.",

Method: We conducted a retrospective study on a series of cases of MCT from April 2011-March 2016. Patient data were obtained and histology reviewed at Department of Pathology, Patan hospital, Lalitpur, Nepal. Results: MCT comprised 225 (56.1 %) out of total 399 cases of ovarian neoplasms. Bilaterality was noted in 9.8 % of the patients. The age range of patients was 8-74 years and majority (82, 36.4 %) were in age group of 21-30 years. The size of tumours ranged from 3.5 to 20 cm. Ischemic modifications, presumably due to torsion, were noted in 10.2 % of cases, mostly in tumours larger than 10 cm. None of the tumours of less than 5 cm presented with signs of torsion. Malignant transformation was present in 7 (3.1 %) cases and was seen especially in older patients and in larger tumours. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common malignant tumour (5 cases). One case was a mixed germ cell tumour with components of MCT and yolk sac tumour. Conclusion: MCT is the most common germ cell tumour in patients of reproductive age group. Complications such as torsion and malignant transformation occur mostly in larger tumours. Objective: As ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTCP) has proved to be a successful method for fertility preservation, the need for pathological evaluation of ovarian tissue in cancer patients prior to autologous transplantation has emerged. Our objective was to establish a structured methodology for histopathological evaluation prior to autologous ovarian transplantation in cancer patients. Method: A single team was responsible for a collaborative work between the Pathology Department, the Fertility Preservation Center, IVF unit, Obstetrics and Gynecology Division and the Cancer Research Center at the Sheba Medical Center. Herein we describe our experience in pathological assessment of ovarian tissue performed on samples from patients with varied background malignancies as part of fertility preservation procedure by OTCP and autologous transplantation. Results: We have established guidelines for the evaluation of ovarian tissue prior to autologous transplantation that rely on histomorphological evaluation assisted by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). In isolated cases tumour-specific molecular markers were sought using PCR. Conclusion: A tight collaboration between the pathologist and the fertility preservation unit is vital for the accurate assessment of ovaries prior to their transplantation. Adherence to the established guidelines may reduce the risks for the patients and increase the success rate of the procedure. Objective: Leiomyoadenomatoid tumour of the uterus is a variant of adenomatoid tumour which is extremely rare and may be difficult to recognize on microscopic examination. We reviewed the histopathological features of this rare entity and we discuss its differential diagnosis. Method: The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings of a leiomyoadenomatoid tumour located in the uterine wall are reported with a review of the related literature. Results: A 37-year-old woman presented with vaginal bleeding during the past 6 months. Pelvic ultrasonography revealed three masses in the myometrium. Laparoscopy transvaginal masses removal was performed under the clinical impression of uterine leiomyomas. Histological examination followed by immunohistochemistry straightened the diagnosis of leiomyoma in 1 mass and confirmed the presence of a biphasic proliferation: an adenomatoid component, which was immunoreactive with calretinin, intermingled with interlacing fascicles of neoplastic muscle cells. The diagnosis of leiomyoadenomatoid tumour along with two leiomyomas was made. The outcome was favorable without any complications at the 4 months follow up evaluation. Conclusion: Here in we report the tenth case of leiomyoadenomatoid tumour of the uterus. Ignorance of this rare entity may lead to false diagnoses, such as a malignant epithelial or mesothelial neoplasm, resulting in a more aggressive therapy. Objective: We studied, through a systematic review of the literature, the clinical, radiological, and pathological particularities of Sex cord tumour with annular tubules (SCTAT). Method: Our work has focused on four cases of SCTAT collected at our department with a systematic review of the literature. Results: The average age was 30 years, ranging from 4 to 76 years. It was associated with Peuz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) in 1/3 of cases. The age of our patients ranged from 10 to 32 years. One of our patients had a concomitant diagnosis of PJS. The tumour was unilateral in all cases, and was revealed by precocious puberty in one case. Gross findings, showed a solid tumour, with yellow cut surface. The size ranged from 0,5 to 28 cm. The morphological features were characteristic but intermediate between granulosa and sertoli cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that tumour cells expressed inhibin and claretinin. The treatment was surgical, often conservative. The diagnosis of malignancy wasn't focused on histological features, but on tumour extension, clinical course, and presence of metastases. Conclusion: SCTAT is a rare tumour, usually benign. Its diagnosis is based on histological examination. Malignant potential is noted in sporadic forms. Treatment is most often conservative, based on oophorectomy. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluated the survival in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) with metastatic lymph nodes. To which we considered the size of nodules and their location. Method: From 2006 to 2016, 36 patients with stages IIA-IVA cervical cancer had metastatic adenopathies and were underwent pretherapeutic laparoscopic staging procedure including abdomino-pelvic exploration and pelvic-paraaortic lymphadenectomy. These patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy. Results: The median age was 51.83 years old. Most lesions were squamous (n = 26) having a better prognosis than the ones with adenocarcinoma. Clinical stage was evenly distributed. The pathology results revealed that 12(33.3 %) patients had metastatic paraaortic(PA) lymph nodes and all of them measured were >5 mm. The 24 remaining patients were found to have metastatic pelvic nodes (6 \u2264 5 and 18 > 5 mm). Eventfree survival rates in patients without PA involvement and with PA metastasis were 85,38 %(SE9,68 %) and 46,64 %(SE15,64 %); P < 0,05. With a median follow-up of 23 months (average39.36), 13(36.1 %) patients had recurrent disease and died. Conclusion: Pretherapeutic laparoscopic assessment of patients with LACC offers valuable information for individualized treatment planning. Moreover the survival of patients with PA nodal involvement greater than 5 mm remained poor. More studies are needed including patients with laparoscopic staging surgery without metastatic nodes for future results. Objective: Most uterine carcinosarcoma are monoclonal with the carcinomatous component being the driving force. However, it is also apparent that a small proportion of these neoplasms are true collision tumours, consisting of independent unrelated carcinomas and sarcomas. Method: We presented a case of a 75 year's old woman who came in our institution with vaginal bleeding. An endometrial curettage was performed. Results: On microscopic examination correlated with immunohistochemistry a diagnosis of high grade stromal sarcoma was made. On CT we found a voluminous uterine tumour with both neoplastic ovary and lymph node metastasis on pelvicaorta. Total hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy was performed. On gross examination we observed a well delineated mass, white, with the following dimensions of 10/10/9 cm; bilateral ovarian mass, white-grey, firm consistency with necrotic areas. On microscopic examination we revealed a high-grade uterine stromal sarcoma and bilateral ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma with lymph node carcinomatous metastases.",

            "text": "Conclusion: A small proportion of uterine carcinosarcomas are true collision tumours and this is important because the prognosis can sometimes be better than in a similar stage carcinosarcoma. Further investigations are required. Objective: M\u00fcllerian adenosarcoma is an uncommon neoplasm of female genital tract composed of a malignant stromal component and a relatively benign glandular element, producing an architecture resembling mammary phyllodes tumour. The pathogenesis of this rare neoplasm however has not yet been well clarified. The purpose of this study is to determine whether dysregulation of Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in the oncogenesis of mammary phyllodes tumour, has also contribution in the development of this gynecologic neoplasia. Method: Immunohistochemical analysis of stromal \u03b2-catenin expression was performed on five M\u00fcllerian adenosarcomas of the cervix and three endocervical polyps. The expression was further divided into the membranous, cytoplasmic, or nuclear activity and was graded as a total score 0 to 5 (membranous (negative: 0, positive: 1)), cytoplasmic (negative: 0, focal: 1, diffuse: 2)) and nuclear (negative: 0, <5 % of cells: 1, >5 % of cells: 2)). Results: All cases of adenosarcoma revealed diffuse membranous and cytoplasimic staining and focal nuclear reactivity of \u03b2-catenin in the stroma (score 4), comparing to the weaker staining in the endocervical polyps (score 2). Conclusion: The Wnt-\u03b2-catenin pathway may be associated with the proliferation of stromal cells in the M\u00fcllerian adenosarcomas of the uterine cervix. Objective: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a common plasma cell dyscrasia, comprising the most indolent form of monoclonal gammopathy. However, approximately 25 % of MGUS cases ultimately progress to plasma cell myeloma (PCM) or related diseases. It is difficult to predict which subset of patients will transform. Based on the fact that the majority of PCMs aberrantly express CD56, in this study we examined its immunophenotypic expression as a prognostic factor in MGUS. Method: A retrospective, descriptive analysis of 42 patients with MGUS, diagnosed between 01/01/2000 and 31/12/2010 was performed, using the expression of the monoclonal antibody anti-CD56 over bone marrow specimens, and analysing 5 years follow-up. Results: Three of the 42 MGUS cases (7.14 %), 2 of 10 (20 %) with CD56 immunoreactivity and 1 of 32 (3.12 %) CD56 immunonegative, showed progression of disease (a progression rate in MGUS with CD56 expression 6.4 times higher). Conclusion: The ability to identify MGUS patients with potential of progression of disease, can offer to this group of patients early treatment options without increasing the morbidity of what is otherwise a relatively indolent entity. A higher relative proportion of CD56+ plasma cells in MGUS may be associated with a higher potential for disease progression. Objective: Erdheim Chester disease is a rare neoplastic histiocytic disorder of adults characterised by the accumulation of foamy macrophages with CD68+, CD1a-, S100-(+), langerin-immunophenotype. Clinical features and organ manifestations are diverse, but skeletal manifestation almost always occur. Current classification of the histiocytic disorders considers it as a member of the Langerhans-related (L) group. Somatic mutations of the MAP Kinase pathway have been described, and may play essential role at the pathogenesis of the disease. Method: Three Erdheim-Chester Disease cases have been diagnosed at our Department between 2013 and 2015. Bone biopsy were performed each cases and lead to diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry panel CD68, S100, CD1a, Langerin have been used, Sanger sequencing have been performed for mutation analysis of BRAF, MAP2K1, NRAS and KRAS genes each case. Results: Two of the cases had BRAFV600E point mutation, the third case harboured another mutation at the MAP Kinase pathway. Conclusion: A few years ago the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease was challenging because of the varying clinical manifestations and lack of special markers, but clinicopathologycal features and molecular methods together may make the diagnose easier and more precise. Objective: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis is a type of proliferation of CD1a and S100 positive Langerhans cells. Method: Lymphomas, some other malignancies, viral infections, cigarette smoking can cause this stiuation. Results: A 56 years old woman presented with left inguinal lymphadenopathy. Lymph node excision was performed. Microscopically, focal Langerhans cells presented in the lymph node also involved by follicular lymphoma.",

            "text": "The presence of langerhans cell proliferations with malignant lymphoma is rare. Today the presence of these cells does not change the treatment. We present the case because of its rarity. Objective: AML can be found after treatment for CLL and is regarded as secondary or therapy-related. However, there are exceptionally rare reports of AML cases concerning patients with untreated CLL or cases with a simultaneous diagnosis of AML and CLL. This case refers to the second category. Method: A 79-year-old male patient presented to the hematological clinic, without any specific symptoms, for the investigation of macrocytic anaemia, an external laboratory finding. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and examined morphologically and immunohistochemically. Results: A mainly nodular and partly interstitial 20 % infiltration by small size neoplastic lymphoid cells with ovoid nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli was observed, with the following immunophenotype: CD20+, CD45RA+, CD79a+, PAX5+, BCL2+, CD5+, CD23+, CD45RO-, CD3-, CD10-, CD38-, CD43-, DBA44-, CCND1-, k-, \u03bb-. Staining with CD34 showed >20 % positive blast cells of myeloid origin. All three marrow cell lineages were dysplastic. Conclusion: The concurrent presence/diagnosis of B-CLL and AML is exceptionally rare, seems to be coincidental and regards two independent clonal neoplastic processes, as shown by cytogenetic and molecular analyses. While arising from two different cellular lines, a common pathogenetic mechanism is rather unlikely. The phenomenon is attributed to a chance coexistence of two uncommon hematologic neoplasms. Objective: Co-existence of T and B cell PTLD are extremely rare but the presence of monoclonal T cell populations in patients with B cell PTLD has been described without features of T cell malignancy. Method: We present one case of metachronous B and T cell PTLD with literature review. Results: 43 years old male transplanted of heart 8 years ago developed generalized lymphadenopathy with a polymorphic PTLD diagnosis, EBV associated and IgH rearrangement. The patient was classified in IVB stage and initially treated with rituximab with no clinical response. The patient starts R-CHOP until partial remission.

            "text": "Objective: Yolk sac tumour also known as endodermal sinus tumour (EST) are malignant germ cell tumours seen in children less than 3 years of age, involving the testis. It is rarely found primarily in extragonadal sites with no involvement of the gonads. Only four cases of temporal bone primary yolk sac tumour have been reported in the literature. Method: Case report: We describe a rare case of extragonadal primary yolk sac tumour of the temporal bone in a 2.5 years old child presenting with a left sided postauricular mass and facial nerve palsy. Results: Biopsy showed reticular areas formed by a loose meshwork lined by flat and cuboidal cells with pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, frequent mitotic figures and vacuolated cytoplasm, with a perivascular organoid arrangement of tumour cells (Schiller-Duval bodies). Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for AFP with focal expression of pancytokeratin and vimentin, consistent with yolk sac tumour. Patient was treated with chemotherapy including cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Conclusion: EST of temporal bone are rare tumours and high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose them. Biopsy of such tumours must be examined by an expert histopathologist to arrive at a diagnosis along with serum alpha protein level to confirm. Objective: Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the salivary gland is a rare tumour accounting for 0.4 % of all malignant salivary gland tumours. We herein present a rare case of LELC of the parotid gland. Method: A 61 year-old man was diagnosed with a mass in the left parotid gland with no other symptoms or past medical history. Ultrasound revealed hypoechoic, inhomogeneous mass of the parotid gland. Patient underwent surgical removal of the mass by a superficial parotidectomy. Results: Initial frozen sections analysis rendered a diagnosis of malignancy. A complete neck dissection was performed. Histopathologic examination of the specimens revealed a parotid gland with solid carcinomatous sheets, trabeculae and isolated small groups of malignant epithelial cells intermingled with lymphoid stroma. The satellite lymph node showed no infiltration. Immunohistochemical analysis showed neoplastic cells with positive staining for pancytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen and focal expression of LMP1. Lymphoid cells were positive for both CD20 and CD3 markers. On the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of stage II, undifferentiated LELC of the parotid gland was made. Conclusion: LELC of the salivary gland is a rare entity with a better prognosis than other poorly differentiated tumours; surgical excision with post-operative radiotherapy is the treatment of choice. Objective: The aim of this report is to describe a rare case of Carcinosarcoma Ex Pleomorphic Adenoma involving the left parotid gland with no history of a long standing Pleomorphic Adenoma, or a Recurrent Pleomorphic Adenoma, and to describe its morphology and important immunohistochemistry findings. Method: The histopathologic findings of the left parotid gland are correlated with the clinical history and ancillary procedures, and surgical pathology staging, including assessment of the draining lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry studies, assessment of proliferative capacity, and possible treatment target is also done. The tumour is also compared with other reported cases with such diagnosis. Objective: Also known as malignant carcinoid, the atypical laryngeal carcinoma is the most frequent neuroendocrine laryngeal neoplasia. This tumour typically presents as a grey polipoid supraglottic mass, with compressive effects and lymph node metastasis, in male patients, with a median age of 61-years-old. Method: We present the case of a 60-year old male who noticed a neck mass and complained about dysphagia and hoarseness. The patient underwent laryngectomy. Results: We received the 8,5/4,5/5 cm laryngectomy specimen, that contained a 5/4,5/2,5 cm, brownish-grey, polipoid, supraglotic tumour. Histopathological examination revealed an epithelial proliferation, with eosinophilic cells, pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, arranged in trabecules, with mucinous areas, oncocytoid cellular transformation, areas of necros i s a n d h a e m o r r h a g e a n d a m i t o t i c r a t e o f 3 / 1 0 H P F. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for CK7, CK34Beta12, CEA, TTF1, Ki67, Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin, confirming the diagnosis of atypical carcinoid of the larynx. Conclusion: Although it has heterogeneous clinical and histopathological aspects, the atypical carcinoid of the larynx may present itself in a typical form, usually confirmed by specific immunohistochemical stains. Objective: There is limited evidence on the effects of prebiotics on morphology of rats oral tissues under II type experimental diabetes mellitus conditions. Method: Diabetes was induced in 42 Wistar rats with the intramuscular injection of the protamine sulfate. Long-term administration of protamine sulfate caused persistent hyperglycemia, reduced glucose tolerance and high insulin resistance. Animals were divided into experimental (1st) and group of comparison (2nd). 1st group of animals was treated with the prebiotic inulin supplementation. Oral tissues and salivary glands samples were examined morphologically, then with the help of computer morphometry. Results: Metabolism disorder due to alloxan-induced hyperglycemia resulted in pathomorphological changes in rat's mucous membrane of cheek, tongue and in minor salivary glands. Inulin treated animals presented with the activation of compensatory-adaptive processes, mucous membranes of cheek and tongue repair, as well as the restoration of the structure of salivary glands. Administration of inulin resulted in a significant decrease of keratinization disorder. Vascular pathology, perivascular edema, macrophage and lymphoid infiltrates had a smaller volume fraction compared with 2nd group. Inulin mediated reduction of a glycemia's level and had the significant antioxidant effect. The beneficial effect on the homeostasis of the oral cavity was also found due to stimulation of bifidum bacteria and lactobacilli growth. Conclusion: Inulin supplementation may improve morphological repair of rats' oral tissues with experimental type 2 diabetes. The prebiotic had proven useful to prevent mucosal inflammatory disorders. Enhanced structural adaptation stimulated the microbiocenosis optimization in the oral cavity. Results: A 52-year-old female, presented with congestion and periorbital pressure which caused blurred vision. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a right sinonasal mass, filling the ethmoid cavity and extended to skull base, periorbitary fat and nasal mucosa. Pathologic examination showed morphologic features similar to those reported for LGSSNM : Moderate to high cellular spindle cell proliferation. The cells had elongated nuclei with coarse chromatin. Some of the cells had nuclear pleomorphisme. The tumour was positive for S100 protein and AML and negative for desmin, CD34, and pankeratin. Ki-67 was assessed at less than 1 % of the spindle cells. A post operative CT scan revealed gross residual tumour, so that the patient received radiotherapy. After 7 months, the patient is disease-free with no signs of recurrence or metastasis.",

Objective: The sinonasal tract is a complex anatomic site, home to a wide variety of lesions. Although inflammatory polyps and papillomas are the most common diagnoses, occasional cases are more difficult, and separating reactive or benign from malignancy can be challenging. We report the case of a seromucinous hamartoma (SH) in a 53-year-old woman. Method: Microscopically, the lesion consisted of a mixed population of small and large glands lined by cuboidal to flattened cells within a hypocellular variable stroma. The glands did not show infiltrative growth or confluent, back to back architecture. The constituent cells were cytologically bland without mitosis and stained positive for CK7, CK19 and HMWK while CK20 was negative.

            "text": "Results: The main differential diagnosis for SH is low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma, non-intestinal type (LGSNAC), with which they are cytologically and immunohistochemically identical. However, the latter typically has complex growth patterns including micropapillary architecture and glands which are back-to-back or fused. Conclusion: SH is a rare benign lesion of the sinonasal tract. The lack of myoepithelial/basal cells is an important diagnostic feature and could be a diagnostic pitfall leading to an erroneous diagnosis of malignancy. Objective: POF is a reactive gingival overgrowth occuring frequently in the anterior maxilla in teenages and young adults. POF predominatly affects women. It is beliewed to arise from the periodental ligament and comprises of 9 % of all gingival overgrowths. Trauma or irritation have been implicated in the etiology of POF. Due to its clinical and histopathological similarities, some POFs are believed to develop initially as a pyogenic granuloma that undergoes fibrous maturation and subsequent calcification. Method: We present a 13-years-old male patient who has a swelling in the front of upper palate that had gradually increased in size during previous 3 months. Intraoral examination revealed a solitary, pedunculated mass. Intraoral periapical radiograph showed no significant bony changes. An excisional biopsy was done. Results: Histopathologic examination showed fibrocellular connective tissue interspersed with plump fibroblasts in between the collagen bundles, surfaced by stratified squamous epithelium. Stroma also revealed foci of calcification which resembled bone like ossifications. POF was diagnosed. Healing was uneventful and patient is followed up for 3 months without any recurrence. Conclusion: Identification of any reactive lesions (pyogenic granuloma, peripheral giant cell carcinoma, peripheral odontogenic fibroma..) requires the formulation of differential diagnosis to enable proper patient evaluation and management. Objective: Pure oncocytic carcinoma arising from a minor salivary gland is an extremely rare neoplasm with only a few cases reported in literature. Method: We present a case of 56 years old man with enlarged left cervical adenopathies. Fine needle aspiration was done and the smears showed an abundant epithelial cells with well-defined cell borders, round to oval, central to eccentrically located moderately pleomorphic nuclei with fine chromatin, prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. CT scan showed pathological cervical adenopaties without evidence of primary lesion. Oral cavity examination showed a swelling in oral mucosa localized around the superior left molars. Biopsy was performed. Microscopic examination showed solid sheets, nests, islands and cords of oncocytic cells with severe atypia and numerous figures of mitosis. Immunohistochemical studies were positive for CK 7 and antimitochondrial antibody. Results: The diagnosis of oncocytic carcinoma was made and it was based on clinical, radiological and morphological findings. Surgical excision of the lesion was not performed duo to advanced stage. Conclusion: However oncocytic carcinoma of the minor salivary gland is a very rare tumour, it has to be suspected if morphology and inmmunohistoquimical studies suggest that and antimitochondrial antibody has always to be performed. as 2 cases with intradermal location, previously. We present a distinctive adipocytic mesenchmal tumour with intramucosal location in adult woman. Method: A 60 -year-old woman was presented with an asymptomatic 3 cm diameter slightly elevated nodular lesion on the lower lip mucosa that had occurred for 6 months. The clinical examination was unremarkable. Total excision was performed. Results: Histopathologically, lesion was lobulated and composed of variable proportions of mature adipocytes, bland univacuolated and multivacuolated lipoblasts that extends to the submucosa. There was neither mitotic figure nor necrosis. The tumour involved the surgical margins. The cells showed no staining with mucicarmine, PAS and dPAS. There was negative staining for pan-cytokeratin, smooth muscle actin, PLAG 1 and positive expression for vimentin and S-100. The 9 months of fallow-up revealed no recurrence. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the present case is the first report of the lipoblastoma-like tumour with intramucosal location of the lip. Objective: To present a retrospective study of 32 years of the experience of our institution with respect salivary gland tumours. Method: A retrospective and descriptive study was desgined. Demographic and histopathologic variables were analyzed. Data was retrieved from the department patient's database and hospital clinical records. Results: Over a 32-year period, a total of 237 major and minor salivary gland tumours were identified. Benign tumours represented 120 (50.6 %) and malignant tumours 117 (49.3 %). The mean age of diagnosis for benign lesions was 40 years and for malignant lesions was 47 years. The most common site affected was the parotid gland for both groups. The most frequent benign tumour was pleomorphic adenoma in 90 (75.0 %) cases, Warthin's tumour in 16 (13.3 %) cases, followed by myoepithelioma and oncocytic tumours in 3 (2.5 %) cases. The most frequent malignant neoplasia identified were mucoepidermoid carcinoma in 29 (24.7 %) cases, adenoid cystic carcinoma in 15 (12.8 %) cases and lymphoma in 13 (11.1 %) cases. Only 9 (3.79 %) cases corresponded to the pediatric population (less than 15 year-old). Conclusion: Pleomorphic adenoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma were the most frequent benign and malignant tumours respectively. The data presented is similar to reports in other centers. Objective: A minority of meningiomas can occur in extracranial locations, the head and neck region being most frequently involved. Method: We report a case of extracranial meningioma in a 71 year old female, presenting as tumefaction in the left parietal region. Ultrasound examination revealed a tumour developing under the epicranial aponeurosis, with an underlying area of bone lysiss. The tumour's vascular pedicle originated from the intracranial space. There was no history of trauma. Total tumour removal followed by cranial reconstruction was performed in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.",

No tumour was visible on the inner part of dura mater. Light microscopic examination revealed an encapsulated lesion composed of spindle cells arranged in whirls. They infiltrated the entire thickness of the bone, but were limited to the outer layer of the dura. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for vimentin and EMA and negative for SMA, S100, CD34 and PR. Conclusion: The identification of the intracranial blood supply could explain this tumours main extracranial mass as arachnoid cells can be found in the sheaths of vessels that emerge through the skull foramina. Objective: Primary tracheal tumours are rare in adults and usually malignant. Only 10 % of them are benign. Hamartomata are tumour-like malformations in which occurs only abnormal mixing of the normal components of the organ. They frequently localized in lung parenchyma and rarely only in trachea. We report a case of a 69-year-old man with a 4-year history of progressive breathlessness. MRI revealed a well-circumscribed dilobe, polypoid mass in the upper third of the tracheal lumen. The lesion was obliterating the tracheal lumen by 40 % and bronchoscopy was performed. Method: We received a grayish, solid, elastic tumour measuring 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.6 cm. Results: Microscopically we observed the mucosa with respiratory and focal squamous epithelium and in submucosa a well-defined tumour with plenty, slightly abnormal vessels with size variety in a myxoid fibrous tissue. There were also adult fat tissue, groups of mucous secreting glands, cartilage and chronic inflammatory cells. There was no cytological atypia and a diagnosis of tracheal hamartoma was made. Conclusion: Benign tumours of trachea grow slowly and they don't have the potential to become malignant. However, based on its localization, they can even cause death due to airway obstruction. For this reason, early diagnosis is crucial. pleomorphic adenoma cases, 167 (70.7 %) out of 236 cases. Of the 82 malignant tumours, Adenoid cystic carcinoma 31 cases (37.8 %) was the most common salivary gland malignant neoplastic lesion followed by mucoepidermoid carcinoma 27 cases (32.9 %). Submandibular gland was the most common site in adenoid cystic carcinoma while parotid gland involved in majority of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Conclusion: Chronic sialadenitis was the most common non-neoplastic lesion, pleomorphic adenoma was the most common benign lesion and adenoid cystic carcinoma (followed by mucoepidermoid carcinoma) was the most common malignant lesion. Objective: Osteosarcomas are the most common tumours of the bone, a heterogenous group of primary malignant neoplasms affecting bones or mesenchymal tissues that ahve histopathologic evidence of osteoid production. We present a rare case of high grade chondroblastic osteosarcoma of the maxillary bone. Method: A 28-year-old, woman in fourth month of pregnacy was admitted to Surgery Department, for the evaluation of the newly diagnosed and rapidly growing mass of the upper jaw. Clinical examination revealed a significant swelling of the left cheek. Intraoral examination revealed a mass that was palpatory hard in consistence and was bleeding focaly. MRI examination showed a poorly defined tumour with indistinct margin. Patient underwent surgery. Frozen section revealed a malignant chondroid tumour suspected on chondrosarcoma. Macroscopically, tumour was fragmented, grayish in colour, hard in consistence. Results: Histology showed malignant neoplasm of mesenchymal origin which was consist of malignant appearing cartilage with peripheral spindling and osteoid production. High grade tomor component showed high mitotic rate. Immunochistochemically tumour cells showed S100, Vimentin, and focally Podoplanin positivity. The diagnosis was consistent with chondorblastic osteosarcoma, high grade. Conclusion: Postoperative course has been regular without unexpected adverse events. Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant bone tumour and it is a relatively a rare disease in the head and neck region. It occurs infrequently in the jaws where they have a better prognosis. Objective: Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the external auditory ear canal are extremely rare. They can clinically mimic granulation tissue and mistaken for inflammation. Method: A 46-year old male presented with progressive right ear blockage, associated with excessive ear digging. There was evidence of bleeding and on examination appeared like granulation tissue. A provisional diagnosis of right traumatic ear canal polyps was made. Excised specimen consisted of multiple bits of greyish brown tissue, measuring 10 mm in aggregate diameter. Entire specimen was submitted for analysis. Sections were stained with routine H&E and later with a panel of IHC markers, comprising pan keratin AE1/AE3, S-100, p63 and CD117. Results: Histology exhibited both cribriform and tubular pattern of adenoid cystic carcinoma component. IHC studies further confirmed the nature of the lesion. The epithelial cells were strongly positive for AE1/ AE3 and the myoepithelial cells showed patchy expression for S-100. p63 highlighted the prominent myoepithelial cells. CD117 showed strong positivity for the tumour element.",

The clinical location of one lesion was mandibulary anterior and the other cases were in mandibulary posterior area. Only one lesion showed multilobular radiographic features. Objective: Defining the histologic features of microcystic acinic cell carcinoma of the salivary glands (MACC) and discussing its main differential diagnoses. Results: A 60-old-year woman with no medical history presented with painful right submandibular swelling lasting for many years. On cervical ultrasound it corresponded to a hypoechoic lymph nodes. FNA cytology concluded to a salivary gland tumour that couldn't be typed. Frozen section examination concluded to a malignat salivary tomor. Further microscopic examination of the paraffin embedded tissue showed a tumour composed of sheets and microcysts. Tumour cells had a clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm. There were areas of mucosecretion. P 63 staining was negative. We concluded to a MACC. Conclusion: MACC has many overlapping features with mucoepidermoid carcinoma of salivary gland. P63 immunohistochemical staining can be useful in the differential diagnosis.

Results: Histopathologically, lesion was characterized by nests of glycogen-rich monomorphic clear cells within a hyaline stroma. Tumour cells were positive with pan-cytokeratin, cytokeratin-7 and revealed low proliferative index for Ki-67. Conclusion: Since, HCCC has a better prognosis and the adequate treatment is wide excision, it should to be differentiated from other clear cells carcinomas. No further therapy was given to the patient. Ten months after the surgery, the patient is symptom free without local recurrence and on regular follow up. Objective: Benign tumours of the palatine tonsil are estimated to 25 % of all neoplasms of the tonsil. Among these benign tumours most of them are squamous papillomas or lymphangiomas. Histologically, the normal tonsillar framework is usually devoid of adipocytes. That may explain the fact that adipocytic tumours are rare in this tissue. We present a rare case of a fibrolipoma of the palatine tonsil. Method: A 25 years old man presented with a foreign body sensation in the throat. Clinical examination revealed a polypoid smooth yellowish mass arising from the right tonsil. The patient underwent a bilateral tonsillectomy and the resected specimen was addressed for a pathological examination. Macroscopic analysis found a lobular yellowish mass measuring 1.5 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.7 cm arising from the right tonsil. Results: Microscopy showed tonsillar tissue with a polypoid lesion composed of mature adipose tissue surrounded with strands of fibrous tissue. The mass was covered of non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium. Conclusion: Fibrolipoma is a benign, slow-growing neoplasm composed of an abnormal collection of mature adipose cells with prominent bundles of mature fibrous tissue traversing fatty lobules. They usually occur in subcutaneous tissues but rarely in the aerodigestive tract especially palatine tonsil. Objective: To report an unusual case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) misdiagnosed as an odontogenic infection. Method: Using a retrospective study design, we analysed the patient file and pathological data. Results: A healthy 44-year-old Caucasian man presented with multiple dental caries and swelling of the left mandible for a month. There was neither any discomfort nor B-symptoms except lymphocytosis. An initial diagnosis with the first histopathological confirmation was buccal cellulitis. However, the patient had no response to antibiotic and surgical treatments. The second histopathological findings demonstrate diffuse, monotonous proliferation of large, round cells. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity to CD20, BCL-2, CD10, negativity to cyclin-D1, TdT and CD3 and no chromosomal change of BCL-2 and BCL-6 genes. Ki-67 reactivity was 90 %. The diagnosis of DLBCL-Stage IE was made. An MRI demonstrated a 3.8 \u00d7 3.1-cm mass involving peri-and paramandibular and parapharyngeal spaces with osteolytic area of the mandible. The patient was opted to 6 cycles of CHOP-R-14. Conclusion: Oral lymphomas are very rare, especially those present as a swelling in patients with poor oral hygiene. Maxillofacial/head and neck surgeons should be aware of this uncommon condition. We also review the clinicopathological aspects of the oral DLBCL. Objective: Describe the pathological characteristics of acinar cell carcinoma of the parotid gland. Method: We report the case of a 64-year-old female patient who presented with a parotid mass whose characteristics were clinically and radiologically suspected. The patient had an enlarged lumpectomy. We proceeded to a frozen section, then the tumour was embedded in formalin 10 %. Afterwards, we performed parafin sections and colored them with hematoxilin eosine. Results: Frozen section concluded to a benign lesion. However, the definitive examination showed a malignant epithelial proliferation often organized in full spans. Tumour cells line glandular lights or wider cavities. They are large and have round or polyhedral shape with granular cytoplasm. The nuclei are round and concentric. Cytoplasmic granules are PAS positive. The diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma of the parotid gland was retained. Conclusion: The acinar cell carcinoma is a rare malignant tumour of the parotid gland. Histologically, the tumour is characterized by serous acinar cells. It has a recurrence rate of 35 % with a risk of metastases of 16 %. Objective: Describe the pathological characteristics of the carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland. Method: We report the case of a 55-year-old woman who presented with a huge swelling of the parotid region evolving for a year. Physical examinaton and MRI were in favor of malignancy. The patient underwent a lumpectomy and lymph node dissection. The samples were embedded in formalin 10 %, then we performed parafin sections and colored them with hematoxilin eosine. Results: By microscopic examination, there was an invasive tumour consisting of malignant epithelial proliferation and benign myoepithelial proliferation within a fibromyxoid stroma. Malignant epithelial proliferation was composed of large round cells with abundant cytoplasm. They exhibit large nuclei that are often vesicular, with nucleoli and sometimes mitotic. The tumour cells form clusters sometimes centered by horny globes. These clusters are surrounded by regular myoepithelial cells. Lymph node dissection was negative and the resection limits were unscathed. The diagnosis of carcinoma was retained. Conclusion: Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is a type of malignant mixed tumour of the parotid gland. It results from the malignant transformation of a preexisting pleomorphic adenoma. Its prognosis is dominated by the capsular invasion and histological grade.",

Method: Sites, books and articles related to pathology were searched and interesting parts were selected. Then they were arranged by time order and suitable photos attached. Results: The results of this study were more than interesting to me, especially in the fields of frozen section, cytopathology and molecular pathology. Conclusion: We can learn from our ancestors how to think, to do research and how to try so much to reach advances in our careers. Objective: Finding of Trichinella spiralis in two patients with neoplasia rise an alert in Argentina to adopt preventive measures, since prevalence is unknown due to lack of mandatory obligatory communication. Method: Patient I: 61 years old female with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Patient II: 54 years old female with invasive ductal carcinoma. Quadrantectomy and breast reconstruction with muscle flap was performed. Due to intercurrent infections the flap was removed and submitted to pathological study. Results: Patient I: Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis was confirmed. Trichinella Spiralis larvae in pre laryngeal muscle was detected as a casual finding. The patient died 15 months after the trichinellosis diagnosis without parasitic treatment. There were no parasitism family history. Patient II: Trichinella Spiralis larvae was detected in the myocutaneous flap. Anti-parasitic treatment was contraindicated by the oncologist and the patient is asymptomatic after 2 years evolution. Breast cancer is in progression. Conclusion: Pork consumption non submitted to official surveillance should be avoided and penalized. It is necessary to remark the importance of mandatory communication of illegal slaughter to eradicate the disease. Objective: Dirofilaria, is a nematode parasite that is spread through mosquito bites. The definite host is the dog. Rarely humans may be infected but since they are not a suitable environment for the nematode, the worm first inhabits cutaneous tissues, then migrates to the right heart ventricle where it eventually dies. Fragments of the worm may reach the pulmonary arteries and lodge in a small calibre vessel to cause infarction or embolism that can be clinically silent or associated with chest pain, fever and haemoptysis. Method: A 58-year-old woman presented with chest pain. Imaging studies revealed a solitary nodule at the inferior lobe of the left lung that was surgically removed. Results: Upon gross examination the nodule appeared well circumscribed. Microscopically the central necrotic area was enclosed by a zone of granulomatous inflammation within a dense fibrous capsule. Masson trichrome, Elastica and Reticulin revealed the vessel wall as well as the prominent muscular lateral cords and the bilateral internal cuticular ridges of the worm which assumed a characteristic \"bat wing\" appearance Conclusion: Dirofilaria is a parasite that rarely affects humans and may clinically resemble a malignancy. A definitive diagnosis of dirofilaria species can be achieved by tissue biopsy for histopathology and molecular testing.",

Goodsir in 1842 and described in his paper published in the Edinburgh Medical Surgery Journal. Further reports have since been made in medical and veterinary literature. Sarcina is most commonly found in the stomach and is often associated with gastric outflow obstruction. Its appearance is distinctive and identification can be made on routine H&E staining. We present a case in which the presence of Sarcina was noted in a gastric biopsy, review the current literature, and discuss the significance of this organism. Method: We present a case of a 48 year-old gentleman who presented with vomiting. A CT scan showed gastric thickening and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. This revealed erythematous gastric mucosa and food residue. Biopsies were taken and histology showed a granulomatous gastritis. In addition, Sarcina-like organisms were seen. Special stains for micro-organisms (Ziehl Neelsen and PASD) were negative. Results: Review of the literature shows that it remains unclear if Sarcina is pathogenic or simply more likely to be identified in cases of gastroparesis or gastric outflow obstruction. In a series of five patients where Sarcina was identified in gastric biopsies, the presence of a concurrent gastric ulcer may put the patient at increased risk of complications such as emphysematous gastritis or perforation. Conclusion: The literature suggests that the presence of Sarcina organisms should prompt further investigation for functional causes of gastric outlet obstruction and delayed gastric emptying, such as occult malignancy. Other authors recommend treatment with antibiotics and anti-ulcer therapy in such cases. Results: Clinical History: A 19 year-old female presented with throat pain and fever. A Monospot test was positive. She deteriorated progressively in 3 days with increasing throat pain, worsening fever and dyspnea. She was hospitalized and on the second day of admission was found in cardiorespiratory arrest. She was resuscitated successfully. Chest X-rays revealed possible ARDS. She coded three more times in a period of 6 h and died. Histopathology: Cervical acute lymphadenitis, necrotizing tonsillitis, Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) and acute interstitial pneumonitis, acute splenitis and superficial splenic tear, acute hepatitis and severe hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Post-mortem laboratory tests: Elevated EBV Ab VCA IgG and IgM. Real-time PCR: 4.65 \u00d7 10^6 EBV copies/ml. Ferritin: >10,000 ng/ml (ref: 18-464 ng/ml).

Conclusion: AIM is a very common infectious disease worldwide that affects children and adolescents. In very rare cases, the disease is fatal due to splenic rupture, encephalitis, DIC and severe HLH. In this case we were able to demonstrate diffuse alveolar damage and severe HLH which ultimately led to the patient's demise. Viral load was extremely high and the cytokine pattern was that of a \"cytokine storm\" leading to increased microvascular permeability, DAD, and HLH. Objective: Morphological diagnostics of tuberculosis in immunosupressed patients may be extremely difficult due to unusual histopathological picture and appearance of acid resistant rods. Method: Autopsy data of a patient X, 80 yearss old, suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia Rfi stage 0/BinetA with isolated deletion of 13q is presented in comparison of clinical, bacteriological, PCR data made during life time with morphological changes, including Ziehl-Nielsen staining. Results: For 4 years she was suffering from chronic leukemia, within last 6 months was suspected tuberculosis. According recent clinical and X-Ray data patient had infiltrative tuberculosis with formation of the cavities with detection of M. tuberculosis in culture and PCR. On autopsy were seen only fungal lesions of trachea, bronchi mucous membranes and suspicious foci in lung tissue. During the routine histopathology were detected numerous fungal filaments probably Aspergillus) and foci with sclerosis. In Ziehl-Nielsen staining typical acid resistant rods were found practically in all fields of view. We considered as the most expressive the localization of the rods just upon fungus. Conclusion: 1) In immunosuppressive patient typical macro-and histological picture of tuberculosis may be absent. 2) Mycobacteria tuberculosis can be localized on the surface of fungi.",

The admitting impression was Rhabdomyosarcoma versus Lymphovascular Malformation. Histopathology specimen, complete work-up for malignancy, special stains and serum serology were done. Results: Skeletal survey, bone marrow biopsy, serum alphafetoprotein and Beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin were negative. Incision biopsy showed non-caseating granulomatous inflammation with giant cell formation and fibrosis. Gram stain, blood culture, tissue Acid Fast Bacilli, Galactomannan and Nitroblue Tetrazolium test were all negative. Serum enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for Strongyloides and Toxocara canis were positive. Conclusion: Visceral larval infection can manifest as aggressive soft tissue tumours and should be included in the differential diagnosis. Serum EIA is useful to detect the causative agent when histology does not reveal the pathogen due to tissue reaction and degenerative changes. Objective: Strongyloidiasis is an infectious disease caused by Strongyloides stercoralis. Disseminated form is associated with severe immunosuppression. It usually mimics severe sepsis and is challenging regarding diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis depends on clinical suspicion and demonstration of the larvae on fluid or tissue. Cutaneous evolvement is rare. Method: A 53-year-old men, HTLV-1 positive, presented with severe sepsis and neutrophilic leukocytosis without eosinophilia. Clinical suspicion was made because of a previous history of strongyloidiasis, vomiting, abdominal pain, hiporexia and maculous, brownish serpiginous abdominal skin lesions. Results: Histology revealed Strongyloides stercoralis in faeces parasitological exam. Larvae were seen among collagen fibers in skin biopsy, together with scant perivascular lymphoid cells and extravased erythrocytes. Larvae were also seen in duodenal biopsies and broncoalveolar and gastric smears. Conclusion: The diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis is based on the finding of larvae in different parts of the body, particularly faeces, gastric and tracheal secretions, bronchial, skin, lung and jejunal biopsies. Strongyloidiasis may cause life threatening infection. Regarding our patient, clinical improvement occurred after 21 days of subcutaneous Ivermectin and the last parasitological exam was negative.",

Due to the lack of clinical suspicion of spine lesions in case of parasitic diseases, doctors face serious difficulties in diagnosing this condition before surgery. Method: The 30-year old patient was operated at the orthopaedics department of the National Centre for Tuberculosis Control with a clinical diagnosis of active stage of tuberculous spondylitis (L1-2-3 vertebrae) with destruction of vertebral bodies. The condition of the patient was complicated by abscess. The patient complained of increasing back pain during the movement (and pain medication decreased the pain), fatigue and weight loss (5 kg during 5-month period), and he noted a deterioration of his condition within the last 4 months. The patient received treatment with anti-TB drugs, which did not have any effect but aggravated his physical condition. The patient received a routine examination, including CT, that allowed to identify destruction of multiple vertebral bodies (L1-2-3) and paravertebral abscess. Results: The patient had right-sided lumbotomy, a surgery to drain paravertebral abscess, necroectomy of vertebral bodies (L1-2-3). During the surgery, multiple cysts containing fluid and bone fragments were removed. Histological examination revealed bone grafts with signs of destruction and cystic structures with inner germinal layer. Conclusion: Our case demonstrates the problem in the diagnosis of spinal echinococcosis in clinical practice. Despite significant post-surgery improvement in the condition of the patient (absence of pain, the patient is able to walk independently), the presence of cystic structures with inner germinal layer creates a high probability of further contamination. Objective: The rarity of anorectal tuberculosis can lead to misdiagnosis of Crohn's disease or foreign body granuloma by unexperienced pathologist. In order to raise awareness of tuberculosis, we present a challenging case from high-incidence population (38.0/100 000). Method: Medical documentation and pathology slides were reviewed in the context of up-to-date medical literature. Results: A 44-year-old male complained about anal pain and bloody discharge for preceding 6 months. Haemorrhoids and chronic anal fissure were suspected clinically and excised. By pathology, foreign body granulomas were reported. A year later, patient experienced clinically recurrent anorectal symptoms; perirectal inflammation and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy by computed tomography; leukocytosis and high level of C-reactive protein. Despite antibacterial/antimycotic treatment, symptoms relapsed again 4 months later. Reevaluation of previous tissue material disclosed caseating granulomas with multinucleated giant and epitheloid cells surrounded by lymphocytes and fibrous tissue. Thus, anorectal tuberculosis was diagnosed. The following evaluation revealed pulmonary tuberculosis, history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for 15 years and presence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum and anorectal tissue. Conclusion: Tuberculosis can affect anorectal soft tissues mimicking haemorroids. The historic paradigm of careful search for caseous necrosis in granulomas still can disclose clinically challenging extrapulmonary tuberculosis, especially in high-incidence regions and HIV-infected patients.",

It is commonly practiced to diagnose both malignant and granulomatous lesions, rarely for suspected infective aetiology. Method: A 23-year-old retroviral positive male presented with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. CT scan revealed multiple, enlarged intraabdominal lymph nodes. A provisional diagnosis of lymphoma was made and EUS-FNA biopsy was carried out. A grayish brown fragment of 1 mm was received and processed in microwave tissue processor. Results: Histology showed mostly fibrinous material, with one localized fragment of lymphoid tissue exhibiting closely packed, diffusely distributed, yeast-like organisms measuring 2 to 4 \u03bcm in size. Similar yeast like organisms were seen in the surrounding fibrinous element, distributed in a loose fashion. The organisms were strongly positive for PAS special stain. Features of disseminated histoplasmosis involving abdominal lymph nodes were confirmed. Conclusion: The diagnosis of histoplasmosis or other opportunistic infections on EUS-FNA biopsy material can be very challenging, but rewarding at the same time. Clinical correlation with histology findings is a necessity on all challenging cases of EUS-FNA. Objective: Amebiasis is seen worldwide and is more prevalent in tropical regions. Incidence of amebiasis in Tunisia is 6 cases per year. The most frequent extraintestinal manifestation of amebiasis is liver abscess. Method: We report a case of a 47-year-old woman who presented with a 6-month-history of pelvic pain and heaviness. Results: Examination revealed a latero-uterine mass. Imagery based on ultrasound examination and CT scan found an ovarian suspicious malignant mass with ascites. Patient had hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendicectomy and omentectomy. Gross examination showed an ovary replaced by a 8x6cm mass of grayish-white nodular tissue. Histologic evaluation showed an intense inflammatory infiltrate, mainly composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes and histiocytes. Actinomycotic granules were seen as basophilic filaments radially arranged, In addition, we discovered numerous amebas among the inflammatory infiltrate and necrosis. Theses findings were consisting with an ovarian actinomycosis and amebiasis. The patient received specific antibiotherapy with a good clinical evolution. Conclusion: Although ovarian actinomycosis is commonly seen, ovarian amebiasis has never been reported in literature. therapy are available treatment options. Radiotherapy is an effective and non-invasive treatment that improves patient's quality of life. Conclusion: The presence of acrometastasis in patients with cancer helps staging the disease and usually indicates a very poor prognosis.",

Method: A 72 year-old man with RC submitted to surgery and chemotherapy was diagnosed with a LM deemed unresectable and underwent TACE. The patient died less than 48 h after the procedure and the autopsy was performed. Results: External examination showed Cullen's sign on the abdominal wall. Internal examination revealed extensive cystosteatonecrosis. The pancreas and peripancreatic tissues exhibited hemorrhagic necrosis and the liver showed a 4 \u00d7 3 cm nodule. On histological examination we observed numerous vessels occluded by reddish microspheres (Irinotecan beads) on multiple sites, including pancreas, liver, biliary tract, soft tissue and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The terminal accident was a sterile NAP (of both pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues) of embolic cause and the fundamental disease was a LM which was partially necrotic. Conclusion: NAP is a described complication of TACE and presumably occurs due to regurgitation of embolic material, which can occur only after the procedure. NAP should be kept in mind even when TACE is thought to have been safely performed. Objective: Spontaneous regression of cancer consists in the complete disappearance or partial shrinkage of a malignant neoplasm without appropriate treatment. It is an extremely rare event, apparently more common for renal cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukaemia, neuroblastoma and melanoma. Method: A 51 years old woman underwent left colectomy for treatment of an adenocarcinoma (staged pT3N1M0), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (twelve FOLFIRI cycles). Six years later two hepatic nodes, suggestive of metastases, were diagnosed by abdominal CT and MRI exams. Before the number and resectability of the hepatic lesions, the patient underwent a right hepatectomy. Results: No complications occurred in the postoperative period, and the patient was discharged on 7th post-operative day. The pathological examination revealed two metastatic nodules, completely necrotic, with no viable tumour. The patient was submitted to adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) and is currently in her 10th post-operative month, free of disease. Conclusion: The authors report an exceedingly rare case of spontaneous regression of colorectal liver metastases. There are only 21 cases of spontaneous regression of colorectal cancer accounted for in the literature from 1900 up to 2005, nine of which relate to remission of liver metastases.",

The relation between the factors affecting the etiopathogenesis (viral hepatitis, alcohol, metabolic disorders, etc.) of hepatocellular carcinoma and microscopic pattern of tumour, differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, and prognostic parameters was investigated in this study. Method: Eighty two cases that underwent resection for hepatocellular carcinoma between 2005 and 2010 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Average age of the cases was 53.47. Of the cases, 89 % (n = 73) were male and 11 % (n = 9) were female. The mean tumour diameter was 4.5 cm. Viral infection was the most important cause of hepatocellular carcinoma at a rate of 85 %, including viral hepatitis B, C, D and HIV. While in 91.5 % of the cases (n = 75) cirrhosis was observed in addition to tumour, %37.5 (n = 24) were established to have dysplastic nodules. Large portal vein or hepatic vein invasion was present in 23.1 % (n = 19) of the cases. Conclusion: Viral etiology for hepatocellular carcinoma (predominantly Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C virus) is still the most significant risk factor in our region. Objective: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas(PDAC) are difficult to diagnose, and do not have any specific immunohistochemical staining pattern . MUC expressions in PDAC can provide prominent clues to predict the prognosis. Evaluation of the relationship between MUC expressions, and survival in our cases is aimed in this study. Method: 54 PDACs resected between 2012 and 16 were stained with CK7, CK20, MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, and CDX2; and examined by 4 blind researchers under a multi-headed microscope. Diffusion and density of staining was scored as 0-3 using a certain scoring system. Histopathologic prognostic parameters were obtained from pathology reports. Survival informations retrieved from \"National Death Information System\". Datas were evaluated by \"Spss Statistics Programme\". Results: F/M ratio was 2/3; and mean age was 65. 43 % was alive, while 53 % was dead. Mean survival was 16 months. MUC1 staining was correlated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0,009). MUC5 density was correlated with lymphatic invasion (p = 0,01). Widespread of MUC6 was correlated with grade (p = 0,008), and survival (P = 0,047). Conclusion: MUC1, MUC5 and MUC6 stains might be useful to predict the risk of lymph node metastasis, grade, and survival of PDACs.",

            "text": "Objective: This study aims to re-evaluate a set of liver biopsies which has been diagnosed solely on H&E stains by performing a standard set of special stains on them. Method: The formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks of liver biopsies reported in two histopathology laboratories between 2008 and 2013 were retrieved. These were stained with H&E and the following standard special stains for liver tissue histology-Perl's Prussian Blue, Reticulin, Sirius Red, Shikata Orcein and PAS with Diastase. The stained slides were re analysed. Results: 74 liver biopsy paraffin blocks were received in the laboratories. 53 (71.6 %) were suitable for analysis out of which 51 (68.9 %) had their clinical details retrievable. In 29 cases (56.9 %), Perl's stain was positive for iron pigment within the hepatocytes with 17 (58.6 %) of these being Grade 1; 7 (24.1 %) Grade 2 and 5 (17.2 %) Grade 3. Shikata orcein revealed hepatitis B viral surface antigen in 15(29.4 %) of the cases while copper-associated protein was demonstrable in 6 (11.8 %) of the cases. The discovery of stainable iron implies some degree of disturbance of iron metabolism and a Grade 3 stainable iron requires investigation for genetic haemochromatosis. The demonstration of copper-associated proteins suggests biliary disease in a non-cirrhotic liver which also requires further investigation. Conclusion: This study highlights the deficiencies of reporting liver biopsies with H&E stain alone which does not help to fully investigate and manage the patient. Objective: The incidence of solid tumours is greater in patients with sarcoidosis. Joint presentation of the two diseases is an unusual finding. Method: A 26-year-old male smoker with a history of systemic sarcoidosis who presented with right lateral lymph-node enlargement and weight loss of 15 kg over 6 months. CT scan of chest and abdomen revealed bilateral laterocervical lymph-node enlargement, multiple swollen thoracic lymph nodes, and bilateral poorlydefined pulmonary nodules, the largest of which measured 1.5 mm. the spleen was enlarged. And A 30 mm hypodense lesion was visible in liver segment VI, subsequently confirmed with PET/TC. Abdominal MRI scan showed a possiblyneoplastic hepatic nodule measuring 4 \u00d7 3.5 cm in segment VI. Results: Examination of liver biopsy specimens revealed a population of neuroendocrine cells displaying positive immunostaining for CKEA1/ EA3, chromogranin and CD56+, and negative staining for TTF1; 1-2 % of proliferating cell were Ki67+, and occurred in conjunction with CD68+ multinucleated giant cells. Histochemical staining to rule out the presence of mycobacteria yielded negative results. The lesion was diagnosed as a liver metastasis from an unknown primary neuroendocrine tumour, within the context of systemic sarcoidosis. The patient was given one subcutaneous injection of 120 mg Lanreotide Autogel every 28 days, as a result of which chromogranin levels and liver function returned to normal. Conclusion: Sarcoidosis predisposes patients to certain types of tumours or whether it is the tumours that cause a sarcoid reaction remains a matter of debate. Objective: Keratin 7 and 19 (K7, K19) immunohistochemical staining (IHS) was employed in past studies to highlight ductular reactions (DR), \"untethered\" hepatocytes, and early loss of canals of Hering (CoH) in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). This study aims to determine utility of K7 and K19 as adjunctive diagnostic methods in diverse chronic liver diseases. Method: 79 archival liver biopsy specimens (LBx) of biliary, non-biliary, and overlap cases were reviewed. Activity grading and staging was done on H&E and trichrome slides. CoH per portal tract (C/P ratio) on K19, extent of DR, amount and distribution of K7+ hepatocytes were assessed quantitatively and semiquantitatively as appropriate. Biliary and nonbiliary groups, early and late stages of disease were statistically compared. Results: C/P ratio is lower in biliary than non-biliary diseases (P < 0.0001) and diminished in PBC and overlap cases compared to PSC (P < 0.0001). More untethered K7+ hepatocytes are seen in early biliary than non-biliary diseases (p < 0.0052) significantly increasing in later stages (p < 0.0011). DR differs (p = 0.00002) between non-biliary and biliary diseases especially in PBC. Conclusion: Early stage LBx K7+ untethered hepatocytes favor chronic cholestatic over hepatitic liver disease. Markedly diminished CoH strongly supports PBC. K7 and K19 is useful in assessment of LBx when characteristic histologic findings are absent.",

            "text": "Objective: Serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs) of the pancreas are rare exocrine pancreatic neoplasms, most of which are benign and do not communicate with the pancreatic duct. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is considered to be a precursor of ductal adenocarcinoma which is microscopically recognised in pancreatic ducts. Method: A 67-year-old Japanese woman presented with a 10-mm, multilocular, cystic lesion at the pancreatic body. Magnetic resonance pancreatography (MRP) showed stenosis of the main pancreatic duct at the pancreatic body and the dilatation of the distal side of the main pancreatic duct. Furthermore, communication between the cystic lesion and the main pancreatic duct was suspected by MRP. Distal pancreatectomy was performed under the preoperative diagnosis of an intraepithelial papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Results: Histologically, the cystic lesion was lined with non-atypical cuboidal or flat epithelium with clear cytoplasm, and thus was diagnosed as an SCN. PanIN-2 or -3 lesions with stromal fibrosis were observed at the main and branch pancreatic ducts. Histological examination revealed no communication between the SCN and pancreatic ducts. Conclusion: An SCN coexisting with another pancreatic neoplasm is rare. When dilatation of the main or branch pancreatic ducts coexists with an SCN, as in this case, it clinically mimics IPMN. Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of malignant tumour in the liver. Cell adhesions are important regulators of cell growth and motility and they are usually altered in cancer. The role of the hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule 2 (HEPACAM2), a member of the immunoglobulin family of adhesion genes, has not been analyzed so far in cancer. In the present study we studied protein expression levels of HEPACAM2 in HCC. Method: Twenty HCCs with available tissue were recruited from Pathology Department between 2008 and 2016. Clinical information was also obtained. A tissue microarray was performed with representative tumour regions and normal liver. Immunohistochemical techniques were applied to study protein expression levels of HEPCAM2 (Sigma Aldrich). Results: HEPACAM2 was weakly expressed in normal liver (nuclear staining). Most of HCCs showed a positive expression with three different staining patterns: nuclear, cytoplasmic and mixed. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between grade of differentiation and staining pattern. A significant correlation was noted between survival time, grade of differentiation and presence of metastasis. Staining patterns were also significantly correlated with presence of metastasis. Conclusion: Our study has revealed three different staining patterns of HEPCAM2 expression in HCCs with clinical relevance. Objective: Primary non-hodgkin lymphoma of the liver is an extremely rare entity. Fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the literature. Classically, it affects middle-aged males with non specific clinical expression and moderate biological perturbations. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinicopathological features of this tumour and to discuss differential diagnoses. Method: A case with primary non-hodgkin lymphoma of the liver was diagnosed in our department. Clinical data and microscopic slides were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Our study was about a 94-year-old woman who presented with right upper-quadrant pain, jaundice and fever. Laboratory tests showed cholestasis and cytolysis. A cholecystectomy was performed as well as a hepatic surgical biopsy motivated by biological findings. Histological examination revealed chronic cholecystitis without acute lesions that could explain the symptoms of cholangitis. Immunohistological examination of the liver concluded to follicular B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma, grade 1. There was no evidence of involvement of the lymph nodes or any other organ. These findings established the diagnosis of primary hepatic lymphoma. Conclusion: The diagnosis of primary hepatic lymphoma is important because the disease is treatable and with new therapeutic drugs, such as rituximab, overall survival has improved for these patients. * Charles Nicole Hospital, Pathology, Tunis, Tunisia",

Results: A 16-year-old girl complained of abdominal pain lasting for 6 months accompanied by weight loss, asthenia and anorexia. Physical examination identified an epigastric and right hypochondrial tenderness without a palpable mass. Abdominal CT and MRI showed a large pancreatic mass arising from the pancreatic body and tail measuring 10 cm and associated with two liver nodules, suggesting a pancreatoblastoma with hepatic metastases. A CT guided biopsy was performed. On histology, the tumour had a pseudopapillary architecture with fibrovascular stalks and small, uniform tumour cells with round nuclei. Tumour cells stained positively for CD 10, synaptophysin and Beta-catenin. We concluded to a SPTP that was confirmed after distal pancreatectomy with metastasectomy. The patient received post operative chemotherapy. Conclusion: SPTP are uncommon low malignant tumours that are rare in children. Metastatic disease unusual and only occurs in around 10 15 % of patients. Histologic differential diagnoses are pancreatoblastoma and neuroendocrine tumour. Immunohistochemistry is essential. Long term follow up is necessary since local recurrence or distant metastases occur in 10 15 % of patients. The value of chemotherapy remains unknown. Objective: Carcinosarcoma of the gallbladder is a rare aggressive neoplasm, accounting for 0.2 % of all gallbladder malignant neoplasms, and is composed of intermingled carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. The later can be heterologous, with osteosarcomatous or chondrosarcomatous elements present. We report a female patient who had advanced stage of this tumour, featuring chondrosarcomatous component with associated eosinophilic hyaline globules within the spindly component of the tumour. Method: Case Report: A 52-year old woman presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. Computed tomography revealed a huge exophytic gallbladder mass, invading or displacing the surrounding structures. The patient underwent radical cholecystectomy, transverse colectomy, distal gastrectomy, liver bed resection and omentectomy. Results: Gross Pathology: The resected gallbladder measured 13 cm and it contained a large exophytic friable tumour that measured 11 cm in length by 6 cm in diameter. Fleshy hemorrhagic tumour nodules were seen extending to the liver, omentum and wall of stomach and colon. Microscopic Findings: The tumour was biphasic featuring both solid malignant epithelial nest and spindly sarcomatous component with several islands of malignant cartilage, Several spindly cells show intracytoplasmic hyaline globules that was PAS positive. Conclusion: This is a rare case of carcinosarcoma of the gallbladder. We found 15 similar cases with chondrosarcomatous elements. However, this is the first case, to our knowledge, described with eosinophilic hyaline globules.",

Method: Here we report two cases of liver SFT and review all the cases described to date. Results: The first case of a 61-year-old man who presented with an accidental finding of a large mass in the left liver and the second case of a 79-year-old man who presented with and 13 cm mass in the liver and multiple pulmonary lesions. Parcial hepatectomy was performed and revealed an SFT confirmed by histopathology and immunohistochemical findings. Conclusion: Primary hepatic STF is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm. Originated in the submesothelial tissue of the liver, this entity is frequently misdiagnosed because of its rarity and unfamiliar characteristics. Despite of its, SFT of the liver should be included in the differential diagnosis of hepatic mesenchymal tumours. A consensus on the essential and definite diagnostic criteria for primary hepatic solitary fibrous tumour must be reached in a timely manner. Objective: Sclerosing hemangiomas (SH) are unusual mesenchymal tumours of the liver. Due to their rarity and atypical imaging the differential diagnosis of SH with malignant hepatic lesions is often challenging. Method: Case notes, histological and immunohistochemical slides of five cases of SH reported in the last 15 years in our hospital were reviewed. Results: The average patient age was 74.6 years (67-82), two men and three women. In two cases the lesions were ressected as possible malignant hepatic tumours, two as suspected metastases and one as an incidental finding. The lesions, ranging from 3 to 55 mm were well-demarcated, firm, white nodules with, in the larger lesions, irregular contours. Microscopically, compressed thin walled vessels with flat endothelial lining without cytologic atypia were seen in a hypocellular densely hyalinised and sclerotic stroma. Immunoreactivity for CD 31 and CD 34 were seen in the lining cells and type IV collagen in the vessel wall. Conclusion: SH are rare, benign hepatic lesions, often submitted for histopathological examination as suspected malignant tumours. Objective: Most tumours of the ampulla of Vater are well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) at this site is uncommon, and only 30 resected cases have been previously reported in the English literature.",

Pathological examination showed that the SRCC had infiltrated into the duodenal muscularis propria and pancreatic parenchyma, and lymph node metastases were identified. Based on the immunohistochemical staining patterns of the positive results for CD19, CD7 and CD20. Conclusion: The origin of SRCCs remains controversial. Since they are predominantly found in gastric cancers, one theory is that these tumours originate from heterotopic gastric mucosa.

            "text": "Objective: After cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma is the second most common type of primary melanoma. Herein, we present a patient with liver metastasis of an uveal melanoma. Method: A 65 years old male presented to the hospital due to abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant of 15 days' duration. The patient had an uveal melanoma 9 years ago and had received local radiotherapy. On clinical examination, the patient appeared icteric with palpable liver. The CT revealed multiple lesions in the liver, the largest being 18 cm. Unfortunately, the patient died due to hepatic encephalopathy and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome without any chemotherapy, due to the high bilirubin levels. Results: The biopsy revealed extensive infiltration of liver by a malignant tumour with solid growth pattern, spindle cells, prominent nucleoli, necrosis, pigment and multiple melanophages. Immunohistochemistry was positive for Melan-A, HMB45, S-100 protein and MITF-1, compatible with metastasis from uveal melanoma. Conclusion: 40 to 50 % of patients develop systemic metastases and the liver is involved in 95 % of patients. While the median time to systemic tumour recurrence in a review was 3 years and 4 months, our case with such a late recurrence shows that close monitoring of the patients for many years is mandatory. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed an EGFR mutation at exon 21p.L858R. Patient was treated with erlotinib until October 2014 due to -Thursday, 29 September 2016 .3 E-PS-14 Molecular Pathology progression. A new biopsy was performed, p.L858R EGFR mutation remains. MET was not amplified by FISH. New biopsy was performed in February 2015. An NGS analysis (Oncomine panel; >1800 mutations in 22 cancer-associated genes) on Ion PGM sequencer (ThermoFisher) on all tumour biopsies and cfDNA showed concordant variants such as EGFR-p.L858R and TP53p.I195T. No druggable pathways were found. Thirty-six years old male diagnosed in March 2014 with MLA. IHC analysis showed ALK/MET positive and ROS1 negative. FISH analysis found an ALK rearrangement. Patient was treated with crizotinib, new biopsy was performed after progression. ALK positivity persisted by IHC, FISH and RT-qPCR analysis. Same NGS modalities were performed on tumour biopsies and cfDNA. No hotspot mutations were found on 22 genes including ALK. Conclusion: NGS is a promising technique; however it might have limited implications in daily clinical practice for some patients. Objective: The most common mutation in melanoma that is applicable for targeted therapy is the point mutation BRAFV600E on the exon 15 of the BRAF gene. Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of 145 metastatic melanoma samples that were tested with next generation sequencing covering the codons 581 to 620 of the BRAF gene (on exon 15) and the exons 2,3 and 4 of the NRAS gene. Results: 49 (33.8 %) samples were positive for a mutation in the BRAF gene and 24 (16.6 %) positive for a mutation in the NRAS gene. Of 49 BRAF-mutated samples 36 (73.5 %) were positive for BRAFV600E, 10 (20.5 %) BRAFV600K, one (2 %) BRAFN581S, one (2 %) BRAFK601E and one (2 %) harbored a BRAFK601N/E586K double mutation. Conclusion: BRAF inhibitors are crucial in the treatment of BRAFV600E mutated melanoma. As the European medicines agency approved BRAF inhibitors for all mutations in BRAFV600, the testing of mutations in BRAFV600 is obligatory. Further, there are case reports and in-vitro data on mutations in exon 15 other than BRAFV600 that are sensitive to targeted therapy. Testing of these other mutations may provide further therapeutic options for patients and should thus be included in routine melanoma mutation analysis panels. Objective: Bronchial-Pulmonary Adenocarcinomas induced the development of EGFR targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, after molecular characterization. EGFR mutations are more frequently observed in patients with adenocarcinomas, female, non-smokers, East-Asian and predict response to TK Inhibitors (TKis). Method: A 66 years old woman presented two PET positive nodules in right lung different lobes in 2014. Then a right upper lobe surgical biopsy demonstrated an adenocarcinoma (acinar and solid patterns) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was analyzed for EGFR mutations by dideoxy sequencing (exons 19 and 21) and the exon 19 was also studied by fragment analysis. Results: EGFR exon 19 showed a duplication of the following amino acids: lysine, isoleucine, proline, valine, alanine and isoleucine; c . 2 2 1 4 _ 2 2 3 1 d u p T A A A A T T C C C G T C G C T A T;p.Lys739_Ile744dupLysIleProValAlaIle. The mutated allele had more 18 bp than wild type allele and this region corresponds to the tyrosine kinase domain; exon 21 was wild type. Conclusion: EGFR mutations are frequent, reflecting implication in lung adenocarcinomas pathogenesis and to prescribe personalized therapies. This case is similar to the rare case found by Kosaka T, Yatabe Y, Endoh H, et al. (2004) but biological significance and clinical outcome has not been referred yet. For now the patient is following Erlotinib with representative clinical outcome (RECIST). Objective: NGS in Pathology routine cannot be understood as an expensive methodology, to understand tumoural behavior, and is useful when diagnosis/therapy genes are enrolled. Method: Following three different histological types of lung cancer (micro-dissected: pre-neoplasic lesion and solid, acinar, and clear cell patterns separately sequenced) FFPE submitted to the Ion Torrent PGM for the 22 gene Oncomine panel analyzed from 10 ng of extracted DNA using 316 chips and 314 chips were analyzed, then data analysis was performed with the Ion Torrent Variant Caller Plugin (hg19) and Ion Report for prediction of the significance of the variants was produced. Results: All pre-neoplasic lesions showed KRAS hotspot mutations (COSM522 and COSM516), presence of PIK3CA (COSM249908) and TP53 (COSM10995 and COSM45044) found in two pre-neoplasic lesions. Tumours had similar hotspot pattern, with the same variants: KRAS (COSM522 and COSM516); TP53 (COSM10995; COSM43746 and COSM45044); and PIK3CA (COSM249908). Without significant differences between studied patterns, somatic variations were also found in FGFR2, DDR2, ERBB4, EGFR and MET genes. Conclusion: When compared with Sanger procedures, NGS brought easier interpretation of various sets of genes, related with carcinogenesis and allowing personalized therapy and/or previewing resistance to the treatment. The aim of NGS will be cost-effective lower procedures. Objective: Fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) have been the historical gold-standard diagnostic approaches for the detection of chromosomal translocations. However, these methods are technically demanding and the interpretation of the results is challenging, even to expert operators. In contrast, RNA workflows such as RT-PCR and targeted RNA-seq are being increasingly used in diagnostics to detect the cancer fusion transcripts because of their accuracy, precision and simpler interpretation. These highly sensitive diagnostic workflows require the availability of high quality and consistent control material. Method: To this end, using Horizon's proprietary genetic manipulation and manufacturing technologies, we have engineered highly characterised and renewable patient-analogue control material in the form of FFPE sections. Results: Our single cell diluted clones and controlled manufacturing procedures ensure precise and reproducible expression levels of the most commonly found mRNA fusion biomarkers allowing kit manufacturers to develop their assays and diagnostic end-users to monitor their pre-analytical (RNA extraction) and analytical workflows (end-point RT-PCR, RT-dPCR and targeted RNA-seq). This allows continuous monitoring of the performance of RNAbased diagnostic assays giving increased confidence in results and better patient's outcomes. Conclusion: Horizon will discuss the making, the applications, the performance and the future development of RNA FFPE Reference standards. Objective: Activating mutations in the KRAS gene are found in 30-40 % of colorectal malignancies and are associated with poor response to anti-EGFR therapies. Until recently, the guidelines recommended testing for mutations in KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), the most common mutations in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRCm) whose tumours harbor RAS mutations. The updated guidelines recommend that before treatment with anti-EGFR antibody therapy, patients with CRCm should be tested for mutations in both KRAS and NRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61) and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146). The effect of this extended mutational analysis on the percentage of patients that is more likely to benefit from an anti-EGFR therapy is studied. Method: 51 cases of CRCm were tested for detection of mutations in KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4 using RealTime PCR (Entrogene). Results: Mutations in KRAS gene were detected in 21 cases (41 %). 18 mutations were located in exon 2 (35 %), while 3 mutations were observed in exon 3 and 4 (6 %). In addition, 3 mutations were detected in NRAS gene (6 %). Conclusion: The updated guidelines lead to the detection of 12 % of additional patients who are unlikely to respond to anti-EGFR therapy. Objective: Determine the types of HPV isolated in invasive cancers in Tunisian patients in order to guide the introduction of the prophylactic vaccine in Tunisia. Method: We worked on 76 cases of invasive cervical cancer. For detection, we used primers MY09 / MY11 and GP5 + / GP6 +. Genotyping was performed by the technique of Reverse Line Blot. Results: All the samples were infected with at least one type of HPV. HPV 16 and 18 were the most frequent types, with a percentage of 94,8 %, the highest frequency was that of HPV 16 (86,8 %) . Conclusion: These results support the introduction of prophylactic vaccines to prevent infection with HPV 16 and HPV 18. Objective: Our study aimed to analyze Periostin (PN) in ovarian cancer (OC), and to correlate its expression with clinico-morphological parameters. Method: The study group consisted of 102 cases of OC histopathologically diagnosed as serous (67 cases), endometrioid (13 cases), clear cells (4 cases), mucinous (13 cases), and other subtypes (5 case); 37 cases were classified as stage I, 10 as stage II, and 55 as stage III; 22 cases were assessed as G1, 31 cases as G2, 46 cases as G3, and 3 cases as undifferentiated. Tissue fragments were immunohistochemically processed using anti-PN antibody. Results: PN expression was positive in 10 cases and negative in 92 cases. The positive cases included 6 serous OC, 2 endometrioid OC, 1 clear cells and mucinous OC, respectively; 3 cases were stage I, and 7 cases stage II; tumour grade was G1 (3 cases), G2 (4 cases) and G3 (3 cases). No significant differences were noted between PN and histological subtypes, stage and grade. Conclusion: PN expression in all tumour subtypes reflects a various distribution, unrelatedly to phenotype. Lack of statistical correlation could be explained by PN ability of architectural restructuring of extracellular matrix, with direct repercussion on invasion and metastasis. Objective: Colorectal cancer (CR) causes majority of mortality in the world. The cetuximab or panitumumab is an effective single agent or chemotherapy for metastatic CR treatment. Molecular markers of colorectal cancer, including KRAS, NRAS and BRAF gene mutations and the microsattellite instability status are evaluated for the development of personalized treatment. In colorectal ancer, frequency of KRAS and NRAS gene mutations are 30-42 % and 2.2-5 %, respectively. In this study, we aimed detection of the frequency of NRAS (codon 12, 13,and 61) gene and KRAS (codon 12, 13, and 61) gene mutations in Turkish population with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Method: We investigated KRAS gene (codon 12, 13, and 61) and NRAS gene (codon 12, 13, and 61) mutations by using pyrosequencing method in 60 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The Therascreen\u00ae KRAS Pyro\u00ae Kit (QIAGEN) and the Therascreen\u00ae NRAS Pyro\u00ae Kit (QIAGEN) were used. Results: The KRAS and NRAS gene mutations were not detected in 37/60 (61.6 %) patients. The KRAS gene mutations were detected in 21/60 (35 %) patients, which were G12D mutation in 13/21 patients, G12V mutation in 3/21 patients, G12C mutation in 2/21 patients and Q61L mutation in 1/21 patient. The NRAS gene mutations were detected in 3/60 (5 %) patients, which were G12D mutation in 1/3 patient, Q61K mutation in 1/3 patient and Q61R mutation in 1/3 patient. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the frequency of NRAS and KRAS gene mutations in Turkish patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is consistent with the literature. increases with decreasing expression of PTC-DR (p < 0.001). Therefore, the severity PTC destruction had a significant impact on the development of TG. Conclusion: Early US changes and capillary DR expression are helpful for predicting the development of TG. This may be useful for determining the patients' with the risk of TG and chronic rejection.",

Crary * University of Minnesota, Lab. Medicine and Pathology, Minneapolis, USA Objective: To evaluate the yield of kidney biopsies performed by different practitioners, using different imaging modalities for guidance, and with different performers of immediate interpretation of adequacy. Method: The number of glomeruli and arteries, and the rate of significant complications secondary to the biopsy procedure were retrospectively reviewed from 362 kidney biopsies. These parameters were compared between differing practitioners performing the biopsy (nephrologists or radiologists), differing imaging modalities for guidance (ultrasound or computed tomography), and between differing interpreters of biopsy adequacy conducted at the time of biopsy (general pathologists, renal pathologists, nephrologists). Results: Biopsies utilizing immediate interpretation were found to have more glomeruli (p = 0.002) and arteries (p = 0.019) when the biopsy was performed by a radiologist compared to a nephrologist. There were significantly more glomeruli (p = 0.0001) and arteries (p = 0.0005) in biopsies with the immediate interpretation performed by pathologists (no difference whether general or renal pathologist) compared to nephrologists. The rate of complications did not significantly differ regardless of biopsy operator or the interpreter of immediate adequacy. Conclusion: The yield of kidney biopsy material may depend on the practitioner conducting the biopsy and the interpreter of immediate adequacy at the time of biopsy. Method: Fifty-seven cases of diabetic patients were divided in DN group (n = 19) and DN superimposed group (n = 38). GBM morphometry, DN classification and quantification of TGF-\u03b21 and fibronectin expression were performed. Results: DN group showed thicker GBM than DN superimposed group. TGF-\u03b21 immunostaining in DN superimposed group was higher in glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. Fibronectin expression was higher in tubulointerstitial compartment. Class III presented higher proteinuria levels than Class I and increased GBM thickness than Class I and II. Class IV had higher serum creatinine levels and lower TGF-\u03b21 expression in glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments than Class I. Class III presented increased glomerular fibronectin comparing to Class IV. Patients with less than 10 years of diabetes showed increased GBM thickness and significant positive correlation between GBM thickness and proteinuria.",

Objective: BKV reactivation in immunosuppressed patients may cause nephropathy and organ loss in renal transplant recipients. BKV may also be associated with an increased risk of kidney and bladder carcinomas. We report a renal transplant patient with BKV nephropathy who developed a urinary bladder carcinoma 10 years post-transplant. Method: A 60-year-old female with microscopic polyangiitis received a kidney transplant and immunosuppressive therapy. Two years later a renal biopsy showed BKV nephropathy and 10 years later a urinary bladder biopsy revealed high-grade urothelial carcinoma with giant cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for SV40 was performed on both biopsies. Results: Renal biopsy showed a dense, cortical and medullary, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. The tubular epithelium exhibited numerous inclusions and strong SV40 nuclear immunoreactivity. Interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy affected >50 % of the cortex. Glomeruli (16) showed slightly increased mesangial matrix. No Ig or complement deposits were detected. Bladder biopsy revealed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with a multinucleated giant cell component and extensive, strong immunoreactivity for SV40 in tumour cell nuclei. Nonneoplastic urothelium was negative. Conclusion: This case adds to a small number of kidney transplant recipients showing an association between BKV reactivation and aggressive variants of urothelial carcinoma. The strong viral immunoreactivity displayed by tumour cells lends support to BKV oncogenic potential.",

Method: The patient's information and imagenology studies were retrieved in order to present this rare tumour. Results: Histological analysis revealed the tumour tissue fragment corresponded to cells in round nodules disposition and a few spindle shaped cells alternating with island of chondroid tissue in a myxoid backgrounds. It had no mitosis and mild atypia. Immunohistochemical markers based on S-100 were positive in tumour cells and the Ki67 was 1 %. The sample was negative for cytokeratin and carcinoembryonic antigen. A diagnosis of low grade myxoid chondrosarcoma was reported. Conclusion: Myxoid chondrosarcoma is a rare tumour, usually found in the lower extremities, with an intermediate grade, and tendency to relapse and metastasize. Chondrosarcoma accounts for 6 % of neoplasms of the base of the skull and 0.15 % of all intracranial tumours. To the authors' knowledge, this is the ninth report of this variant reported at this location. The tumour origin is believed to be the choroid plexus, the pineal region or the dura mater. It is more frequent in males. The incidence is unknown and the prognosis is generally poor due to its local invasion. Objective: Originally derived from the neural crest, melanocytes are normal constituents of the pia mater and subarachnoid. They are widely scattered across the meninges with higher density in the central area of the superior spinal cord, brainstem and skull base. Meningeal melanocytoma is an uncommon, slowly growing, well differentiated melanocytic neoplasm. It was first described in 1972 and currently accounts for less than 0,1 % of brain tumours. Method: A 47 years old man was admitted to our hospital, accusing bilateral paresthesia of the upper limbs, often accompanied by pain. MRI revealed a T1 hyperintense craniospinal lesion of about 19/17,6/ 41,1 mm occupying most of the spinal canal from the foramen magnum to C2-C3 level. Neurosurgical resection was performed. Results: The most striking feature of the tumour, both macroscopic and microscopic was that of a heavily pigmented lesion. Histopathological appearance featured nestes of slightly spindled, pigmented cells with oval nuclei and small nucleoli, often with perivascular distribution and accompanied by melanophages. No cytologyc atypia or mytotic figures were present. It was diagnosed as meningeal melanocytoma, later confirmed by immunohistochemestry. Postsurgical evolution was favorable and the patient undergoes neurological followup. Conclusion: Primary CNS melanocytic neoplasms have intrigued pathologists for many years. When evaluating these lesions, special attention must be paid to their histologic features to distinguish melanocytoma from its malignant counterpart. Objective: Gliosarcoma is a rare neoplasm of the central nervous system characterized by biphasic histological pattern displaying both glial and sarcomatous components. Method: A 62 year-old woman presented with a left sided hemiparesia and symptoms of intracranial hypertension. On physical examination, the patient was confused with left hemiplegia. Computer tomography revealed an irregular enhancing mass lesion involving the frontal insular cortex that was thought to be consistent with a brain metastasis. A craniotomy was performed with gross total resection of the tumour. Results: On gross examination, the tumour was grey colored with bleeding and necrotic components. Microscopic examination showed a mix of glial and sarcomatous components with large areas of necrosis. The glial component was composed of large atypical cells with numerous mitotic figures. The mesenchymal elements were composed of spindle shaped cells with elongated, excentrated, vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The glial components were GFAP positive. Mesenchymal cells were GFAP, KL1 negative, vimentin and caldesomon positive. The diagnosis of rhabdomyoblastic gliosarcoma was made . The patient passed away few days after surgery. Conclusion: Gliosarcoma is an aggressive tumour characterized by a biphasic glial and sarcomatous pattern. However, it is not well established whether it is a variant from glioblastoma or a separate entity. Objective: The papillary glioneuronal tumour is a relatively new entity in neuropathology. It was first described in 1996 as a \"pseudopapillary ganglioneurocytoma\" by Komori. In 2007 it was included in the WHO clasification with less than 40 cases reported in literature. Method: We present the case of a 51 years old man, admitted to our hospital with left sided hemiparesis, dizziness and headaches. Neuroimaging revealed a large, well demarcated cystic tumour in the right temporal and parietal lobes. Its largest diameter was of 73 mm and it contained an inner solid component of about 15 mm. The patient was scheduled for neurosurgery and intraoperative consultation was requested, revealing characteristic neuronal and glial features. The lesion was excised and thoroughly examined by light microscopy. Results: H-E histologic sections showed small oligodendrocyte-like tumour cells forming vasocentric papillae and solid, nodular structures with a neuropil-like matrix. The cells in this matrix ranged from oligodendroglia-like neurocites to well differentiated neurons. The final diagnosis was of a papillary glioneuronal tumour. Conclusion: While still an uncommon find, it is important to recognize this lesion as it is a grade I neoplasm with excellent prognosis. Despite sharing many common features to other neuroglial tumours, its papillary architecture is highly distinctive. Soon after excision, our patient's condition improved with slight remission of the symptoms. Objective: Ganglioneuroma is an asymptomatic clinically silent tumour that rarely occur in the adrenal glands. Diagnosis is often incidental because unlike other neuroblastic tumours it does not secrete excess catecholamine or steroid hormones. However, an index of suspicion with radiographic studies such as MRI, CT scan and tissue biopsy can aid early detection. Results: Case Report: A 25-year-old female presented with 10-months history of a right flank pain and persistent headache. Pain was none radiating and dull. Clinical examination was of a well-preserved female, with a 6 \u00d7 5 cm non tender right flank mass, BP = 120/80 mmHg, Pulse = 88 bpm, Urea and electrolytes were within range. CT scan revealed a circumscribed mass on the upper pole of the right kidney.",

Neuroschistosomiasis (NE) is considered a rare complication, affecting mainly the spinal cord, followed by cerebellum, with few cases affecting the brain. We report a case of cerebral schistosomiasis caused by S. mansoni with pseudotumoural presentation. Method: A 19-year-old man presented with headache and refractory seizures. The computed tomography (CT) showed a front-parietal expansive lesion with perilesional edema suggesting astrocytoma. Results: After excision, the histology revealed granulomas surrounding S. mansoni eggs. He was treated with praziquantel and prednisone, with clinical improvement and resolution of the lesion. Conclusion: In NE, the eggs of the parasites migrate through the vertebral venous plexus, causing immune reaction and granuloma formation. The spinal cord is usually affected by S. mansoni and S. haematobium and acute myelopathy is the most common manifestation. Cerebral disease is most often caused by S. japonicum and the clinical presentation varies from acute encephalitis to lesions that can be mistaken for tumours, especially gliomas. NE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions in the central nervous system of patients who live or have visited endemic areas.",

Hemangioblastoma occur both sporadically predominantly in the cerebellum and in association with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Method: A 71 year old woman presented with a 5 month history of headache, vomiting and walking instability. Imaging studies demonstrated a cyst in the cerebellum measuring 3 cm in greatest diameter with a well-circumscribed mural nodule measuring 1,4 cm. The lesion was resected. Results: Microscopically the nodule consisted of clear stromal cells in a rich capillary network. The stromal cells showed low mitotic rate and cells were positive for Vimentin,S100p, NSE and negative for GFAP, EMA,CD10,D240 and VEGF.A limited population of tumour cells was immunoreactive with CD56 and Inhibin A. The Ki67 index was low. Based on the previously mentioned morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics the diagnosis of hemangioblastoma WHO grade I was posed. Conclusion: Hemangioblastoma is an uncommon neoplasm which have rather characteristic MR imaging features. The prognosis is excellent if surgical resection can be achieved. Other neoplasms with clear cell features should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Objective: Report a central neurocytoma case in a Brazilian male. Method: Case description: A 20-year-old unconscious male was admitted to the department of emergency and he was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension (IH). He reported headaches during the last 6 months, and also blackouts and vomitings. The computerised tomography (CT) showed an expansive intraventricular tumour, with mass effect, and obstructive hydrocephalus. The histopathological analyse showed multiple softened and greyish material fragments measuring 2,8 \u00d7 2,4 \u00d7 0,6 cm, with regular structures and differentiated small lymphocytes like cells, with enlarged and bare nuclei, coarse chromatin, pale and clear cytoplasm, compact arrangements with rosettes like structures, rare mitoses and occasional atypia, without necrosis or haemorrhage. The Immunohistochemistry analyse (IHA) with the peroxidase system revealed EMA, GFAP, vimentin negative, Ki-67 (+4 %), CD57 (+) and IDH1 (inconclusive), and together with other findings that were compatible with Central Neurocytoma. Results: Discussion: Most patients present IH as initial symptom in neurocytomas. The clinical history is short and is not easy to make the differential diagnosis with other intraventricular tumours, such as oligodendroglioma and ependymoma, which was our first hypothesis. The IHA for the neuronal markers such as synaptophysin, calcineurin, neuron specific enolase and microtubule-associated with the protein 2, as well as the immuno-negativity for the glial fibrillary acidic protein and for the neurofilament proteins allowed our diagnosis. The tumour rarity and typical presentation are peculiarities in this case. Conclusion: Neurocytomas must be remembered as a cause of IH.",

Results: We report a case of a 30 years old man who presented symptoms of increased intracranial pressure for 2 months. The patient did not have any medical history or family history related to brain lesion. CT scan and Brain MRI showed a lobulated hypervascular 50 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 50 mm sized mass intensely enhanced on contrast study and occupying the whole of fourth ventricle with obstructive hydrocephalous. The treatement was the surgery excision. The tumour appeared macroscopically as cauliflowerlike, 40 mm sized masse, brownish and friable. Histopathology revealed a papillary tumour with a delicate fibrovascular core lined by columnar or cuboidal epithelial cells with vesicular nuclei without nuclear atypia, mitosis, and necrosis. Their appearance is very similar to normal choroid plexus. Conclusion: CPP is a benign neuroepithelial intraventricular lesion WHO grade I account for less than 1 % of all brain tumours.

Objective: To describe and analyze the characteristics of suicide cases occurred in Morocco and presented neuropsychiatric disorders due to drug intoxication, in order to contribute to the reduction of morbidity and mortality that result. Method: This is a retrospective study of all cases of suicide by drugswhich presented neuropsychiatric disorders -, occurred in Morocco between 1990 and 2013, and reported to the Moroccan Poison Control Centre. Results: In 24 years, 1674 cases were reported (399 adolescents and 1275 adults). The sex-ratio (F/M) was 2,9. The psycholeptics (59 %) were the most implicated from the morbidity viewpoint, the antiparkinsonians (5,3 %) were from the lethality viewpoint. The median duration of consultation was 4 h. The most observed neuropsychiatric disorders were somnolence (33 %) and hypoesthesia (29 %). Coma had appeared with a lethality of 4,9 %. Decontamination was carried out in 57 % of cases. Twenty-two cases have kept sequelae, 11 have died. Following the oddsratio analysis, the gender is a risk factor (a risk of 5 for males). Conclusion: Suicidal poisoning by nervous system drugs causes severe cases which require immediate medical attention but also a heavy management. The best therapeutic approach remains prevention, so it is important to follow the anti-toxic control strategy. Objective: To present a case of a pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PMA) in a 21yo male patient. PMA is a recently recognized WHO grade 2 tumour that was previously characterized as a subtype of the WHO grade 1 pilocytic astrocytoma. PMA is reported to have an average age at presentation ranging from 10 to 18 months. Method: The patient presented to our hospital with an episode of severe headache. An MRI scan revealed a mass in the suprasellar region of the brain. Two biopsies of the tumour, each measuring 0,5 cm, were sent to our laboratory and were examined using hematoxylin and eosin slides, as well as immunohistochemical techniques. Results: Microscopically the tumour was composed of piloid cells in a mucoid matrix, with a predominantly angiocentric cell arrangement. The lesion did not contain Rosenthal fibers or eosinophilic granular bodies. The tumour cells were positive for vimentin, GFAP, S-100 and Synaptophysin, while ki-67 was estimated at less than 3 %. These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of PMA. Conclusion: PMA typically presents in the very young (median 10 months) and can occur in older children. They are rare in adults. To our knowledge there are only 23 adult patients with PMA reported in the English language literature. Objective: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystem disorder that's characterized by the growth of nervous system tumours. Pilocytic astrocytomas, preferably located within the optic pathway, are the major type of central nervous system (CNS) tumours in this disease but synchronous lesions, especially in unusual ages and localizations, are rare. We will report a case. Method: A 42-year-old woman, with HIV infection, presented with seizure. The MRI revealed two synchronous CNS tumours: one in the parietal lobe and the other in the cerebellum. The previous year patient was diagnosed with a multifocal GIST of the small bowel. Results: Both CNS tumours had morphological features consistent with pilocytic astrocytomas, as cystic morphology, Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies. None had BRAF or IDH1 mutations neither MGMT hypermethylation. With that unusual combination of neoplasms pathologists alerted for NF1. After that other clinical signs of NF1 were found, so a genetic test was ordered. Conclusion: NF1's patients require a multidisciplinary follow-up where pathologists may play a role. Pathologist should always alert for NF1 when facing a pilocytic astrocytoma of optic pathway but synchronous pilocytic astrocytomas or multifocal GISTs, although not being a diagnostic criteria, should also raise suspicion. Objective: Spindle-cell oncocytoma (SCO) is a grade I tumour according to WHO/2007 classification. It was presumed that SCO arises from the folliculostellate cells of the adenohypophysis but recent immunohistochemical and ultrastructactural studies suggest that it derives from the pituicytes of the posterior pituitary and thus shares a common origin with pituicytomas and granular cell tumours. Method: A 52-year-old woman presented with headache and visual disturbances. CT scan showed a tumour with suprasellar extension compressing the optic chiasm that resembled a macroadenoma. The tumour could not be easily separated from the pituitary during the surgical operation.",

After splenectomy, the organ's weight was 200 g, measuring 12 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 6cm. Gross examination revealed a solitary, well-circumscribed, unencapsulated, redish, partially hemorrhagic tumour with maximum diameter 5.5 cm. Results: Microscopically, structurally disorganized splenic red pulp tissue (highlighted by reticulin stain), with no organized white pulp, was observed. Sinusoidal vascular structures were present, in an inflammatory background with histiocytic predominance. The cells of the lesion were positive for CD-8 and CD-34, focally positive for CD-31, whereas Factor VIII was negative. These findings were compatible with the diagnosis of splenic hamartoma. Conclusion: Splenic hamartoma is a tumour-like malformation most commonly representing an incidental finding. Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate a splenic hamartoma from a splenic hemangioma, which is the most common primary tumour of the spleen. A positive stain for CD-8 is helpful in such cases, as splenic hamartomas are immunoreactive for CD-8, while splenic hemangiomas are CD-8 negative. Objective: Thymic carcinoma frequently spreads to the pleural space, regional lymph nodes, liver and brain. However, the initial clinical presentation involving spinal metastases is extremely rare. Method: We present a case of a 62-year old female with progressive paraparesis. The CT and the MRI showed a neoplastic lesion with an intradural component, which caused the spinal compression, and an extradural component; located on the left edge of the spinal canal at the level of the thoracic vertebrae T11-T12. Results: Microscopically the neoplastic cells were of medium size, with scant cytoplasm, atypical dark nuclei, frequent mitoses. They were organized in solid nests. Necrosis was absent and crushing artifact was observed in some areas. The immunohistochemical study revealed positivity of the neoplastic cells for CKAE1/AE3, CK8, 34BE12, P63, CD5, while CK20, TTF1, GCDFP15, CD56, Synaptophysin, CD45(LCA), HMB45 were negative. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical examinations using CKAE1/AE3, P63 and mainly the thymic-carcinoma specific marker CD5 were crucial for confirming the primary site in the Thymus and should be performed in all cases of cancer of unknown origin. Objective: The Central Region of Ghana has many world heritage sites related to the slave trade dotted along its sandy beaches. We aimed at finding out the causes of death in the Central Region of Ghana, and highlight the potential effects of these causes of death on tourism and socio-economic development.

            "text": "Results: Out of 470 autopsies performed, 72 % were males and 28 % females. 52.8 % were young adults (18-44 years). Unnatural deaths were the leading cause of death (58.7 %) most being road traffic accidents (58-30.4 % as occupants of vehicles 21.4 % as pedestrians), followed by drowning (15.9 %). 14. 3 % of deaths were due to infections followed by cardiovascular deaths (6.8 %). Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of road traffic accidents and drowning in the Central Region of Ghana and infections remain a significant cause of death. This has a negative effect on tourism and socioeconomic development. Objective: The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification of the tumours of soft tissue considered the term hemangiopericytoma (HPC) obsolete, and places all such tumours within the extrapleural solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) category. In contrast, central nervous system SFT and HPC continue to be regarded as different entities in the latest version of the WHO CNS tumour classification. This study aims to highlight the helpful histological and immunohistochemical features of each of hemangiopericytoma and solitary fibrous tumour to enable reproducible classification. Method: 25 solitary fibrous tumours and hemangiopericytoma with variable histological features and different localization were selected and then stained for CD34; BCL2; VIMENTINE and CD99. Results: The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 50 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.25. The most common presenting clinical symptoms were a slow growing mass. The characteristic immunoprofile of solitary fibrous tumour was BCL2+ with diffuse staining; CD99+; VIMENTIN+ and CD34+ with a diffuse and intense staining. For hemangiopericytoma, the immunoprofile was BCL2+ with focal staining; CD99+; VIMENTIN+; and CD34\u00b1. Conclusion: Staining for CD34; BCL2; VIMENTINE and CD99 comprises a concise panel for distinguishing Solitary fibrous tumour from Hemangiopericytoma.",

Amyloid can be also detected with several techniques such as Congo-red stain, as well as crystal violet, thioflavin, methyl violet stains, cytokeratin 5/6 stain. The goal of this study is to reevaluate the stains of Congo-red and thioflavin-t of cutanous amyloidosis. Method: Twenty-seven cases of cutaneous amyloidosis diagnosed between 2013 and 2016 years were included the study. Congo-red staining and its typical polarization were used to diagnose amyloidosis. Original congo red stained sections were compared with decolorized and restained with thioflavin-t sections of 27 cases with cutaneous amyloidosis. Results: 16/27 patients were female and 11 were male. While 24 cases were localised cutaneous amyloidosis, 3 were systemic. Most of the localized amyloidosis were primary localized type except one secondary amyloidosis due to the seborrheic keratosis. Thioflavin-t was stained of all cases and it was evaluated easily than Congo-red. One case was diagnosed during the study who were not stained with Congo-red before.",

The neonate had dysmorphic facies with normal head circumference, presented with seizures and no respiratory activity. Postnatal USG of the head revealed HA. The neonate died 56 h after delivery. At autopsy, the transillumination sign was positive. Hemispheres were formed by 1 mm thick layer of pio-glial membrane. Cerebellum and optic nerves were atrophic. Otherwise, autopsy findings were within normal limits. Conclusion: We refer a rare case of HA, in which the injury of the brain must have developed between 13th and 23rd weeks of gestation. No infection or other possible known causes of HA were identified. Objective: Liver tumours are uncommon during childhood, when they show an age-dependent distribution and are mostly malignant. Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma (HMH) is a rare benign lesion, presumably congenital, usually occuring under the age of 2. There is still no agreement upon its histogenesis, whether it represents developmental anomaly, true neoplasm or reactive lesion resulting from biliary obstruction or anomalous blood supply. Results: A 1-year-old boy was admitted due to acute abdomen. Clinical investigation revealed a hepatic tumour (US, MR) which was surgically removed. The tumour was torquated around a stalk connected to falciform ligament, and adherent to omentum and transverse colon. Grossly, it had gray-brown, glistening, lobular surface and measured 6 \u00d7 5,5 \u00d7 4,5 cm. The cut-surface was necrotic and hemorrhagic, with only a narrow rim of preserved solid tissue at the periphery. Histologically, it was composed of abundant, myxoid and loose stroma with focally dilated bile ducts, sparse cords of hepatocytes and numerous blood vessels, some of which thrombosed. There were only a few mitotic figures, but no atypia. No extramedullary haematopoiesis was noted. The tumour margins were positive. Conclusion: Unlike classic HMH showing multiple cysts, sometimes resembling lymphangioma, the tumour in our case was solid and pedunculated. Although the lesion is benign and should not recur, since it may rarely progress into malignancy, we believe our patient should be followed-up for a longer period. Objective: Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a congenital disorder characterized by abdominal and urinary bladder distension, microcolon and abnormal GI peristalsis. Method: We report the case of a newborn with suspicious antenatal ultrasound findings: distended urinary bladder and abdomen. After the birth she was transferred to the NICU and multiple investigations were performed, including pathological examination of ileal and colonic biopsies. Results: Complementary investigations revealed a thick walled urinary bladder, narrowing of the rectosigmoid and other anomalies. The laparostomy confirmed the malrotation of the mesentery, with rightsided jejunoileum and left-sided ileocecal valve. The histology revealed fibrous submucosa and hyperplastic ganglion cells. Muscularis propria (MP) showed a hypoplastic external layer and hyperplastic myenteric plexus. Immunohistochemistry revealed weak SMA reaction of the internal MP layer. S100 showed the hyperplastic feature of the myenteric plexus. Calretinin was negative in ganglion cells and neural fibers. The ileum showed edematous submucosa, with atrophic MP, weakly positive for SMA. Ganglion cells were present and hyperplastic in the myenteric plexus. S100 and Calretinin were positive in neural structures. Conclusion: MMIHS is a severe disorder with poor prognosis and limited lines of treatment. The case presented revealed an interesting immunohistochemically profile, somewhat similar to Hirschprung's disease. The infant was alive 10 months after the birth, with left ileostomy and gastrostomy. Objective: Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is rare, with an incidence of 1/14.000 newborns, mostly sporadic, with rare cases linked to anomalies of chromosome 11, characterized by overgrowth leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance, known as hemihyperplasia. We aim to present a review of clinicopathologic correlation of BWS at our institution. Method: We present a 9 year retrospective (2006-2015) review of BWS, performing a correlation between pre-natal ultrasonography, morphological characteristics findings and literature. Results: The study included four cases, 2M/2F, with gestational age between 19 and 36 weeks, three from medical termination pregnancies and one from a fetal death. The characteristics found in ultrasonography were increased kidney volume in all cases; omphalocele, overgrowth, kidneys with low differentiation and macroglossia in half of cases. The characteristics features observed in autopsy were: dysplastic kidneys (75 %), increased adrenal gland (75 %) omphalocele (50 %), macroglossia (50 %), pancreatic hyperplasia (50 %), and reduction of the head perimeter (50 %). All cases, but one, have a clinical diagnose of BWS and one case have molecular confirmation (25 %), none with family history. Conclusion: The recognition of this syndrome is an important finding for a correct genetic counseling for future pregnancies of the parents. Objective: Meckel Gruber syndrome is a lethal autosomal recessive disorder, caused by the failure of mesodermal induction. It is characterised by meningo-encephalocele, policystic kidneys and polydactyly. Other abnormalities associated with this syndrome is cleft palate, cardiovascular disease, hepatic ductal dysplasia, oligohydramnios, genital deformations, bowed legs, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, pulmoner hipoplasia. The world wide incidence varies from 1 in 1.300 to 1 in 140.000 live births. Highest incidance was reported in Gujarati Indians. Method: A 29-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with gestation at 12 weeks. She had a previous healthy fullterm pregnancy. There was no history of teratogenic drugs or infectious disease. A routine ultrasonography revealed a single fetus with occipital encephalocel and bilateral polycystic kidneys. The pregnancy was terminated and a 22 g male fetus was delivered and send for autopsy. Macroscopic examination of the fetus showed polydactyly, occipital encephalocel measuring 2 \u00d7 1 cm and Objective: To describe the case of a middle-aged male with an incidental pulmonary cribriform adenocarcinoma and to review the literature on this entity. Method: A 50 year old gentleman, who was being followed up for a pericardial cyst discovered in 2012, was found to have a 10 mm left upper lung nodule on follow-up computed tomographic assessment in 2014. This lesion grew from 10 to 17 mm by the end of 2015 and thereupon, both the pericardial cyst and the lung lesion were excised. The tumour histologically exhibited a predominantly cribriform appearance, with mucin-filled acinar structures set in a desmoplastic stroma, together with a focal thyroid-like appearance. Diffuse TTF1 and CK7 positivity together with CK20, thyroglobulin, calretinin, synaptophysin, keratin 5/6 and calponin negativitiy confirmed the pulmonary origin of the tumour. Results: The patient is well, with no evidence of recurrence. Conclusion: Pulmonary cribriform adenocarcinomas are exceedingly rare and are often misdiagnosed as metastatic tumours. They are currently considered a subtype of acinar adenocarcinoma. They occur predominantly in older male smokers and do not seem to harbour epidermal growth factor receptor mutations, although other mutations, including mutations in KRAS, ALK1 and ROS1, have been isolated. Their behaviour is, as yet, unclear. Objective: Cancer stem cell markers are a group of pleuripotent cells actively dividing in an uncontrollable manner and are recognized by specific landmarks on their membrane as glycoprotein's or in the cytoplasm as enzymes or in the nucleus, e.g. ALDH1,CD-44, CD-133 etc. AIM-To detect CSC ALDH-1 in lung cancer and its clinicopathological correlation for prognostication. Method: Biopsies from 36 fresh previously untreated lung cancer patients visiting [ELMC&H & KGMU, Lucknow were taken. The biopsies were analyzed by using Haematoxylin and Immunohistochemistry for ALDH1 [Daco] . Results: In 36 samples analyzed, 35 were Non Small cell carcinoma [NSCLC] and 1 was Small cell carcinoma lung. On applying ALDH1 [IHC], 28 were positive (golden brown staining) and 08 were negative. Out of the 28 IHC positive cases all were NSCLC while out of the 08 negative cases 1 was SCLC and 07 NSCLC. Staging of lung cancer was performed in 29 out of the 36 positive cases. In the 29 cases staged, 68.9 % were in stage III+IV, 30.9 % in stage II+I. Seven cases could not be staged due to lack of CT findings. Objective: Pulmonary Hyalinizing Granuloma (PHG) is an uncommon lung disease suggested to be associated with exaggerated immune response to an antigenic stimuli. Method: We present the second case in the literature of PHG with Cattleman's Disease who was admitted with diarrhea and dry cough.",

Among these tumours, five showed predominantly solid pattern and in the remaining two-one was papillary pattern of growth. Concordance between IHC strong positive cases and FISH was 83.3 % (5 of 6). Conclusion: More sensitive, available and less expensive ALK IHC is recommended as screening. For All IHC positive cases to confirm ALK gene rearrangements FISH analysis is recommended. Proportion of patients with tumours positive ALK protein IHC and FISH is higher than in published data. Objective: Differential diagnosis between primary TTF-1 negative adenocarcinomas of the lung and metastatic ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas can be challenging. Therefore, we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of various mucins in resected primary adenocarcinomas of the lung and compared data to known expression patterns of mucins in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Method: We collected 215 cases of resected adenocarcinomas of the lung and explored the immunohistochemical expression of TTF-1, MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC and MUC6. Positive mucin expression was evaluated as percentage of positive cells and results were compared with positive or negative expression of TTF-1. Because up to 63 cases were not evaluable and due to the subsequent smaller sample size, statistical evaluation was limited and data was analyzed by descriptive means only. Analysis was performed by SPSS 21. Results: MUC1 was evaluable in 165 cases (100 %) and showed expression in all tumour cells in 86.7 % of cases (143/165). MUC2 was positive in 0.6 % (1/162). 17.9 % of the cases (27/151) were positive for MUC4 in all tumour cells and completely negative in 45 % of cases (68/151).",

We investigated the prognostic value of growth patterns, mitotic count, nuclear atypia, peritumoural lymphatic, vascular and airway spread, necrosis, the Kadota grading system and the modified Sica scoring system. Method: Between 2004 and 2013, 183 resected stage Ia LA could be matched with information on overall survival. The reviewed parameters were evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis, Log-Rank test, multivariate Cox regression and the ROC curve test. Results: Sensitivity (74-52 %) and specificity (44.7-57.5 %) were low for mitotic counts. Growth pattern (p = 0.038), nuclear atypia (p = 0.022), and vascular (p = 0.001) and airway (p = 0.038) spread were significant markers in the univariate model. We found no difference between low and intermediate grades in either the Kadota or the Sica system. By Cox regression, growth pattern (p = 0.001) and vascular invasion (p = 0.01) were independent prognostic markers. Conclusion: Growth pattern and vascular invasion were independent prognostic factors in stage Ia LA. A high mitotic rate does not necessarily confer bad prognosis. We suggest that LA grades should be assigned as low (in situ, minimally invasive, lepidic, acinar and papillary carcinoma) and high (solid and micropapillary). Objective: Pulmonary hypertension is a complex disease characterized by profound pulmonary artery adventitia (PA) remodeling. Our aim was to examine the hypothesis that fibro-proliferative and inflammatory changes of the PA adventitia are related to the presence of myofibroblast activation that induce Collagen V expression in a dependent IL-17 signaling manner. Method: Wister male rats were sacrificed 21 day after treatment with monocrotaline (MCT;n = 5) compared to controls (CTR;n = 5). Right ventricular pressure; HE and picrossirius red staining, immunohistochemistry for IL-17-related markers and \"in situ\" immunofluorescence for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and collagen types I and V, electron microscopy and fibronexus morphometry were used. Results: The right ventricular pressure and right cardiac hypertrophy index was higher in MCT than CTR group (p < 0,05). A significant increase of PA adventitia thickness (9-times vs CTR), total collagen (20 % vs CTR), collagen I (3-times \u00d7 CTR), collagen V (4-times vs CTR), fibroblasts + SMA expression (2-times vs CTR), plasmatic membrane of myofibroblast (4-times more fibronexus vs CTR), IL-17, IL-6 and TNF\u03b2 were observed.

About 50 % of the tumours occur in patients aged less than 30 years. There is no association with smoking. Computerized tomography of the chest shows a well-defined, centrally located endobronchial mass. A histopathological subclassification into lowgrade and high-grade types has been proposed. High grade tumours are rare, and the diagnosis should be determined after careful exclusion of adenosquamous carcinoma. A lack of TTF1 and napsin A in a MEC may also be useful for differential diagnosis. MAML2 rearrangement is exclusively seen in MEC. Conclusion: Primary pulmonary MEC represents a rare type of lung cancer. Patients with low-grade MECs, generally have a good prognosis after primary surgical resection.

Granulomas without any clinical signs or symptoms may be seen randomly in lymph nodes or lung parenchyma. This study aims to find frequency and histopathological features of granulomas within parenchyma and lymph nodes of resected lung tumours in our institution. Method: Of the 134 cases of resected lung tumours from the surgical database of our institution from 2011 to 2016, 15 cases had granulomas. H&E stained slides were evaluated to identify detailed histomorphological features of granulomas. Results: The patients were 4 females and 11 males ranging from 44 to 77 years (median 62 years). The diagnosis of lung tumours was adenocarcinoma (n = 7),squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3), large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (n = 2), pleomorphic carcinoma (n = 2),and atypical carcinoid (n = 1). All of the specimens had lymph node dissection. There were granulomas only in lymph nodes of 9 cases, only in parenchyma of 4 cases, and both in lymph nodes andadn parenchyma of 2 cases. Both granulomas and metastatic tumour were seen in same lymph node station in 1 case. Necrosis in granulomas was detected in 3 cases. Some of the granulomas of 2 cases had fibrosis. EZN stain was applied to 5 cases, one of them represented bacillus. Conclusion: Granulomas are identified in 11 % of our cases. The lymph nodes and parenchyma of the lung tumour specimens may contain granulomas which could be a sign of infectious or inflammatory pathology. Objective: Among rare forms of interstitial disseminated diseases of lungs, intravascular sclerogenic bronchoalveolar tumour is the most difficult for diagnostics; in majority of cases it is detected accidentally, which is caused by absence of pathognomonic clinical features. Method: Methods: histological material is obtained by minimally invasive videothoracoscopic access. Tinction with hematoxylin and eosin for Objective: Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a rare locally aggressive vascular tumour of intermediate malignancy. It occurs nearly exclusively during childhood. Adult cases have been reported recently. Method: A 36 year old woman that is presented with a superficial cutanous lesion on her arm. On histologic examination there is a tumoural lesion that was charachterized by vascular structure with irregularly shaped and randomly distributed. Some of the tumour cells were with vesicular and some of them were with hyperchromatic nucleus and with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Necrosis was not observed. There was only one mitosis in 10 HPF. In immunohistochemical staining, tumour cells were positive with CD34, CD31, SMA and were negative with HHV8. According to these histologic and immunohistochemical findings; our diagnosis was \" kaposiform hemangioendothelioma\". Results: Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma in adults are different from those in children. Although % 75 of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma presented with cutanous involvement, numerous anatomic location can be seen. Because of its invasive growth pattern and no-self healing tendency kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is classified as intermediate (borderline) malignancy. Conclusion: We are reporting this case because of its rarity in adults and also because of difficulties in differential diagnosis with other vascular tumours that have similiar histological features.",

About 300 cases have been described in the literature, 16 located in the spine. Here we describe a spinal case. Method: A 37-year-old man presented with generalized joint pain and pathological fractures of right femoral neck and calcaneus. Laboratory investigations revealed hyphosphatemia, normocalcemia, low levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and elevated levels of alkaline phosphate(AP). DXA scan showed a bone mineral density within the osteoporotic range. Thoracic CT scan disclosed a mass in L1 body and right vertebral pedicle. The lesion was biopsied and, subsequently, resected. Results: Histopathological examination revealed a tumour composed of bland spindle and epithelioid cells in a myxoid matrix. Thin-walled blood vessels were present, some with ectatic, tortuous outlines. Osteoclast-type giant cells and mature adipocytes were additionally found. Immunohistochemical staining was negative for pan-cytokeratins, CD34 and desmin and focally positive for SMA and S100 protein.",

Conclusion: PMT is an important cause of osteomalacia in the adult and must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Recognition of its histological features is critical, as complete tumour resection leads to cure in most cases. Objective: The most common spinal disorder in elderly is lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), resulting partly from ligamentum flavum (LF) hypertrophy. Its pathophysiology is not completely understood. The present study wants to elucidate the role of estrogen receptor (ER) in hypertrophied LF. Method: LF samples of 38 patients with LSS were obtained during spinal decompression. Twelve LF samples from patients with disk herniation served as controls. H&E and Elastica stains and immunohistochemistry for ER were performed. Proportion of fibrosis, loss and/or degeneration of elastic fibers and proliferation of collagen fibers were assessed according to the scores of Sairyo and Okuda. Group differences in ER, Sairyo and Okuda scores between patients and controls, additional orthopedic diagnoses and sex were assessed with the Mann-Whitney-U-test.",

            "text": "Objective: Chordomas are rare, slowly growing neoplasms of bone that arise from embryonic remnants of the notochord. These tumours typically occur in the axial skeleton. Method: Between November 2015-April 2016, in our department, were rendered three new diagnoses of chordoma with sacral, intracanalar and skull base locations. The pacients were 42, 55 respectively 75-years-old, the oldest one being male. Results: In all of the three cases, the tissue fragments received had a white-gray colour and soft or elastic consistency. The tumour showed a lobular growth pattern of round to ovoid cells, with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm growing in cords and clusters in a basophilic myxoid stroma. Variable amount of phisaliphorous cells were present. Nuclei were generally small, cytologically bland, some of them indented by intracytoplasmatic vacuoles. Despite of bland morphology, significant infiltration of bone and/or adjacent soft tissue was noticed in each case; tumour cells were positive for AE1AE3, EMA, S100 and showed scarce positivity for Ki67, thus confirming the diagnosis. Conclusion: In spite of low grade appearance, chordoma is an aggressive lesion with high risk of local recurrences and metastastatic potential which has to be differentiated from other chordoid lesions, with different treatment and prognosis such as chordoid meningioma, chordoid glioma or metastatic carcinoma. Objective: Clear cell chondrosarcoma (CCC) is a rare variant of chondrosarcoma, most commonly encountered in the proximal part of the femur or humerus, being considered a low-grade malignancy with high survival rates comparing with chondrosarcoma or chondroblastic osteosarcoma. Method: We present the case of a 41-year-old man having a large femoral tumour proximally located. Surgical excision and total hip replacement was performed. Results: Resection specimen included an 11/8/4 cm tumour extending from the femoral head and greater trochanter to the upper portion of the diaphysis. Histopathology revealed groups of cells with round, hypertrophic, centrally located nuclei, some with prominent single/multiple nucleoli, clear/pale-pink cytoplasm and distinct cytoplasmatic membranes. Cartilaginous areas and numerous woven bone trabeculae with osteoclast-like giant cells were present. Mitotic figures were rare. Tumour cells were positive for S100 and negative for AE1AE3, SMA and CD34, thus supporting the chondroblastic origin of the tumour. Based on morphology and immunophenotype a final diagnosis of CCC was established. Conclusion: Differential diagnosis of CCC imply exclusion of several entities belonging to various spectrum of diseases such as chondrosarcoma, chondroblastic osteosarcoma, chondroblastoma, osteoblastoma and metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma. Correct diagnosis is mandatory since CCC has a better prognosis than others malignancies with similar morphology.",

            "text": "Objective: The concept of benign notochord cell tumour (BNCT) was established recently and BNCT was listed on WHO classification of bone tumours in 2013. It is still challenging to distinguish precisely between BNCT and well differentiated chordoma because their histologic findings are quite similar each other. To know morphologic key features for distinguishing BNCT from chordoma we examined their histologic sections and then tried to differentiate between BNCT and chordoma components in lesions that are diagnosed \"chordoma arising in BNCT\" on imaging study. Method: HE-stained sections of BNCTs and chordomas found in our file were carefully examined under microscope. Results: Histologic findings of BNCT and well differentiated chordoma overlapped. BNCT-like components in chordoma, however, made a transition to typical chordoma histology and chordoma shows fine fibrous capsules and/or septa with/without vasculature in addition to lobular architecture, intercellular myxoid matrix, and bone destruction. Hence, the border of chordoma seems very smooth. In contrast, the border of BNCT seems slightly zigzag along the contour of adjacent marrow adipocytes. aim of this case report was to evaluate the histopathological and immunohistochemical features of these rare tumours. Method: We present the case of a 71-year-old man with a left testicular mass measuring 4.5 cm. Under the assumption of a testicular malignant tumour inguinal orchiectomy was performed. Results: Histopathological examination revealed testicular parenchyma presenting a cystic lession with intracystic blunt papillae lined by columnar epithelium, with hyperchromatic nuclei, areas of hobnail cells and very rare mitoses. A focus of microinvasion was present. The underlying stroma had a fibrilar ovarian-like aspect. Immunohistochemistry showed the expression of CK7, EMA, PLAP, WT1, CA 125 and ER, while Calretinin was positive in isolated cells, and CEA, MOC 31, CK20 were negative. Ki-67 value was 10 %. Final diagnosis was serous papillary tumour of the testis with low malignant potential-ovarian type. Conclusion: Serous papillary tumour of ovarian-type in the testis should be considered when the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma is suspected. The microscopic appearance combined with the immunoprofile of the tumours are helpful for differential diagnosis. Objective: The tumour microenvironment comprises numerous signaling molecules and pathways that influence the angiogenic response. As angiogenesis is essential for tumour growth and metastasis, controlling tumour-associated angiogenesis is a promising tactic in limiting cancer progression. WT1 is an important regulator of cancer growth via modulation of tumour vascularization. Method: A tissue microarray with 48 different cases of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCC) was performed with respective normal renal tissue as controls. Tumoural angiogenesis was assessed by immunohistochemical studies against WT1 and CD31 molecules (a reliable endothelial marker) (Roche). Samples were imaged using a 40X objective lens. ImageJ, a digital image analysis software, was used to quantify the percentage of positivity. Results: A strong WT-1 cytoplasmic stain was invariably observed in the endothelial cells from all cases and controls. None of cases showed WT1 in tumoural cells. Angiogenesis was significant observed in cases against controls by WT1 and CD31 expression. A strong correlation was found between WT1 and CD31 expression. No significant associations were determined between clinical variables and angiogenesis in CCRCC. Conclusion: WT1 is a reliable marker for angiogenesis. There is a strong correlation between WT1 and CD31 expression. Angiogenesis is not associated with clinical variables in CCRCC.",

Grossly, the tumour was a wellcircumscribed, solid and cystic mass with extensive necrosis. Microscopically it was composed of sheets of small cells with round nuclei, fine chromatin and scant cytoplasm, with occasional peritheliomatous growth. Immunohistochemistry showed strong membrane positivity for CD99. Rearrangements of the EWSR1 gene were found by fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirming the diagnosis of renal ES/PNET. The patient was treated with post-operative chemotherapy and no evidence of disease was found after 2 years of follow-up. Conclusion: Although rare, primary ES/PNET represents a diagnostic challenge and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of renal malignancies in young adults. Complementary studies are fundamental to differentiate it from similar renal small cell tumours, like blastematous nephroblastoma or neuroblastoma.

Pathohistological examination was performed by H&E staining, histochemical and immunohistochemical studies. Results: Diagnosis was made on a morphologic basis, proven by the histochemical and immunohistochemical studies. Morphologically, tumour consisted of pleomorphic cells with large, hyperchromatic nuclei and myxoid stroma positive for Acian blue. Immunohistochemical studies showed malignant cells positive for Vimentin, Alfa SMA, NSE, Synaptophysin, S-100, EMA, and negative for CKAE1/3, CD34, CD31, CD68, CD57, Desmin, HMB45, ALK1. Conclusion: Exstrasceletal myxoid chondrosarcoma of the penis is very rare tumour. This case presents that an exstrasceletal chondrosarcoma shows ultrastructural evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation and neuroendocrine immunophenotype.

            "text": "Objective: Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) is an unusual tumour of kidney. Cases of MTSCC combined with papillary renal cell carcinoma type I. (PRCC-T1) has been described, bringing into question relationship of both entities. Here we present an additional case. Method: A 62-year-old lady underwent nephrectomy for left kidney tumour measuring 60 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 50 mm. Five smaller tumours up to 13 mm and several serous cysts up to 30 mm were scattered around main tumour. Histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical staining for CK18, CD10, RCC and AMACR was performed. Results: The largest tumour was predominantly PRCC-T1, WHO/ISUP grade 3, with areas of necrosis and papillary, tubular or solid architecture. There was second component of the tumour composed of uniform spindle cells intermingled with cords or small tubules of cuboidal cells. Cells were embedded in myxoid, Alcian-blue positive matrix; a finding consistent with diagnosis of MTSCC (WHO/ISUP grade 3). Transition between both tumours was apparent focally. There was strong positivity of RCC and weak expression of CK18 in PRCC-T1 component, contrasting with no expression of RCC and strong positivity of CK18 in MTSCC component. PRCC-T1 was strongly positive for AMACR, while MTSCC component stained only weakly in focal pattern. CD10 expression was negative. Smaller tumours in surroundings were papillary adenomas without any remarkable features. Conclusion: MTSCC and PRCC-T1 may share morphological and immunohistochemical features. Although rare, the tumours with both morphologic components are described. The data from previous genetic studies reported in literature suggests that at least a part of such cases are rather PRCC-T1 with unusual growth pattern than real collision tumour. Objective: The present study aimed to assess changes in tumour grade, size, and pT in resampling of initial tumours as residual and recurrent tumours. Method: This study was conducted on 154 patients with bladder cancer who referred to Hasheminejad Kidney Center from 2003 to 2011. Residual and recurrent tumours were considered as the presence of tumour in second TUR-B specimens performed within 8 weeks after the first one and more than 8 weeks respectively. Results: The grade of tumour in 7.7 % of residual and 17.6 % of recurrent tumours changed from low to high. Increasing the primary tumour size from less than 3 cm to more was found in 15.4 % and 13.2 % of residual and recurrent tumours. Changing pTa to pT1 occurred in 6.8 %, pTa to pT2 in 3.4 % and pT1 to pT2 in 10.2 % of residual tumours. Also in recurrent tumours changing pTa to pT1 occurred in 12.1 %, pTa to pT2 in 1.5 % and pT1 to pT2 in 6 %. Conclusion: There is a possibility of changing the grade, size and pT in residual tumours because of incomplete sampling. The grade change in recurrent tumours may be due to new mutations and changes in size and pT indicate tumour progression. Objective: Benign intratesticular fibrous proliferations are rare and most arise from the paratesticular region. Testicular fibroma of gonadal stromal origin is much more rarer. According to the recent WHO classification they are classified under the sex cord/gonadal stromal tumour. The tumour presents as slow-growing, sometimes painful mass which is not associated with hormonal alteration. Method: A 52-year old male presented with scrotal pain lasting for 1 month. There was no history of trauma, urologic or hormonal symptoms. The ultrasonography revealed mildly heterogeneous wellcircumscribed mass in the left testis. The patient underwent left radical orchiectomy. Macroscopic examination showed testicular paranchymal mass measuring 2.1 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm which has white solid cut surface. Microscopically the tumour composed of uniform bland spindle cells within collagenous stroma. The mitotic activity was 0-1/10 HPF. Atypia and necrosis were absent. There was no associated minor sex cord elements. Immunohistochemically tumour cells were positive with SMA and vimentin, very focally positive with S-100, CD99 and CD34. Desmin and inhibin were negative. The Ki67 proliferating index was %1. Results: Histopathologic diagnosis was testicular fibroma. Conclusion: Testicular fibroma of gonadal stromal origin is a rare benign neoplasm which must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of benign intratesticular fibrous proliferations.",

We present three cases of nephrogenic adenoma of UB. Method: Three male patients underwent transurethral resection (TUR) of a previous confirmed bladder mass in two cases and urethral mass in one case, by imaging techniques. Standard procedure for histopathologycal analysis and immunohistochemistry was performed. Results: Two of the patients had previous history of chronic infection and one of them had previous prostatectomy. Two of them presented with dysuria and urinary frequency and the third patient had hematuria. One surgical specimen (utehral one) was a polipod lesion with diameter of 1,3 cm, and the another two consisted of urinary \"chips\" from bladder TUR. Microscopically small tubules, looking similar to mesonepric tubules, lined by a single layer of bland cuboidal cell with clear cytoplasm ant small nuclei were found. In one case some of the tubules were cysticaly dilated and some contained basophilic secretion. The stroma was edematous and rich of inflammatory cells. All three cases were CK7, EMA and PAX 2 positive. Conclusion: The accurate diagnosis of nephrogenic adenoma is important because it can mimic malignant lesions.",

Kutlu * Trakya University, Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Edirne, Turkey unusual for a bladder cancer, but suggestive of a testicular seminoma, immunohistochemistry was performed. Results: Tumour cells expressed PLAP, CD117, OCT4, and were negative for CK7, CK20, p63. The morphological features and the immunohistochemical profile led to a diagnosis of TS metastasis in the bladder. Reviewing the medical history, we found that 2 years before the patient had undergone orchiectomy for pure seminoma with multiple metastases. During this period the patient was lost of view. Conclusion: Although very rare, metastases of TS in the bladder should be kept in mind when facing a bladder tumour with unusual morphology. In our case, the patients' medical history prompted to differentiate between a TS metastasis in the bladder and an extragonadal seminoma. Objective: Post-transplantation Kaposi sarcoma is a well known complication due to the immunosuppressive agents. It is mainly seen in the skin but rarely visceral organs are also affected like lung, liver, gastrointestinal tract and lymph nodes. However there are only 4 cases of Kaposi sarcoma originated from the ureter in the literature. Method: A 52 years old man received a lived related kidney transplantation from his brother in our hospital. Hydronephrosis was seen at the transplant kidney with the USG after 10 months. MRI showed lymph nodes around the ureter and surgery was done for tissue diagnosis. After the diagnosis of mesenchymal tumour with intraoperative frozen section, that part of ureter was resected. Results: Microscopic examination revealed a spindle cell neoplasm under the epithelium of the ureter. The tumour was composed of nodules of spindle cells and slit-like vascular spaces with erythrocytes. The mitotic activity was increased also. Immunohistrochemistry showed positive staining with vimentin, Fli-1, CD31, ERG and HHV-8. On the other hand keratin, EMA, S-100, desmin and CD34 were negative. Kaposi sarcoma was diagnosed according to the histological and immunohistochemical features. Conclusion: Post transplant Kaposi sarcoma of the ureter is extremely rare and must be kept in mind that can arise even at the visceral organs. Objective: Primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) of kidney is a rare neoplasm with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Correct diagnosis leads to proper therapy. Method: We report a 21 year old man complaining of right flank pain and gross hematuria. Microscopic examination of H&E slides, IHC studies and PCR study of paraffin embedded blocks are evaluated. Results: CT scan revealed right renal mass. Microscopic examination of renal mass biopsy showed a small round cell tumour. IHC studies showed negative immune reactions for CK7, CK20, CD56, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD45, CD3 and CD 20 but NSE and CD99 were positive in tumoural cells. Real time PCR on paraffin block proved the presence of t (11-22) translocation (EWS-FL1 fusion transcript) which confirmed the diagnosis of PNET. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical nephrectomy. Microscopic examination of radical nephrectomy showed only therapy related changes with no tumour residue. The patient is symptom-free until now. Conclusion: Only two cases of renal PNET were previously reported from Iran. Macroscopically many of the cases are located in the medullary/pelvic region like. For definite diagnosis, IHC studies are required which show more than 90 % positivity for CD99. Cytogenetic analyses can be helpful showing EWS gene and ETS translocation.",

Method: A case of the nested variant of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is presented with differential diagnosis. Results: A 50-year-old man presented with hematuria. Physical examination no abnormal findings. Cystoscopic examination revealed that trigone, and right lateral wall of the bladder were replaced by mass approximately 3,5 cm in diameter. The tumour was macroscopically resected. Microscopically, tumour cells are infiltrated into part of the mucosal urothelium, lamina propria, and muscularis propria. Few mitotic figures were seen. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells showed diffuse CK 7, and focal CK20 expression. Chromogranin was not expressed. After a follow up period for 6 months the patient free from recurrence. Conclusion: Nested variant of urothelial carcinoma must be differentiated from the benign proliferative lesions of urothelium, such as von brunn nests, cystitis cystica and glandularis, nephrogenic metaplasia, inverted papilloma and paraganglioma. Despite its bland cytological features it behaves aggressively with invasion, metastasis and death being common. Objective: Endometriosis is the presence of functional endometroid tissue in ectopic foci outside of uterine cavity. Extragenital endometriosis rarely involves the ur\u0131nary system. It \u0131s usually diagnosed in women aged between 30 and 35 years. \u0130t is uncommon and even more likely to remain undiagnosed in postmenopausal women. Method: A 51-year-old postmenopasual woman, presented with pelvic pain worsening in the last 6 months. The gynecological examination was not remarkable. She was diagnosed with severe left hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to left ureteral obstruction resulting in 20 % left renal function. Computer tomography mass in left urethral distal segment with homogenous contrast uptake that appeared postcontrast series. cystoscopy in the left ureter, 3-cm polypoid mass was seen which fills the lumen. A cold cup biopsy was taken. Results: Histopathological examination; of biopsy specimen revealed benign endometrial gland and stroma underlining the normal urothelium. Immunohistochemical studies were performed for estrogen receptor, CK7, CK20 and CD10. The endometrial glands were positive for Estrogen receptore and CK7 while the endometrial stroma was positive for CD10. Ck20 stainingn not observed. Conclusion: Urinary tract endometriosis is observed in 1-2 % of women with endometriosis. Ureteral involvment may lead to obstruction progressive hydroureteronephrosis and renal loss. Polypoid endometriosis is a rare manifestation of endometriosis that may be mistaken for a neoplasm on clinical, intraoperative, or pathologic assessment. Objective: PEComas are rare mesenchymal tumours composed of cells that express both myogenic and melanocytic markers making their diagnosis difficult. The urinary bladder is an extremely rare location for PEComa. The association of urinary bladder PEComa with another type of mesenchymal tumour is quite unusual. The aim of the present paper is to present a rare case of PEComa of the urinary bladder in a patient previously diagnosed with gastric GIST. Method: A 66 years-old woman, with multiple comorbidities, including a gastric polypoid tumour (in 2004), was admitted in the hospital for investigation of an incidentally discovered bladder tumour. Results: The 12 mm resected bladder tumour with mesenchymal appearance on routine stain presented the following IHC profile: positive reaction for HMB45 and SMA, lack of reactivity for CK, EMA, S100, Des, ALK, CD117 and CD34. The resected gastric tumour (2004) was diffusely and strongly positive for CD117 and CD34. The patient remained disease-free 6 month after surgery for bladder lesion with no evidence of tumour recurrence or new neoplasms. Conclusion: Mesenchymal tumours detected metachronously in patients with history of GIST should be evaluated in order to confirm or to exclude metastatic GISTs, but may represent distinct lesions. The possibility, although very rare, of a urinary bladder PEComa should be considered and as a consequence a wide IHC panel must be performed in order to avoid erroneous diagnosis. Objective: Primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) are a group of small round cell tumours and presumed to be of neural-crest origin. PNET can rarely arise outside the nervous system except for bone and soft tissue. The kidney is a rare primary location for these tumours and approximately 50 cases of renal PNET (rPNET) have been reported in the literature. We describe a case of rPNET and review its clinical and histologic features. Method: The surgical specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded. The sections were stained with routinary H&E. Immunohistochemistry was performed. Results: The patient was 50-year-old man and underwent left radical nephrectomy. On gross examination, the tumour measured 6 \u00d7 5 cm in dimensions, with cystic areas and necrosis. Microscopically tumours consisted of small sized, round-oval shaped primitive cells with irregular nuclei and scanty cytoplasm, and presented rosette formation in some areas. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for vimentin and MIC-2(CD99). Microscopic and immunohistochemical findings were compatible with rPNET. Conclusion: Though a rare entity, due to its aggressive nature rPNET should be included in the differential diagnosis of renal tumours especially in children and young adults.",

            "text": "Objective: To study a correlation of AMACR and ERG expression with PSA levels and morphological features of the prostate cancer. Method: We studied a material of needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy from 702 prostate cancer patients (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The expression of AMACR and ERG was estimated with the use of immunostaining. For the statistical analysis the software Statistica8.0 and MedCalc12.4.0 was used. Results: The correlation of preoperative PSA levels with Gleason first component and Gleason score on needle biopsy and with Gleason score and TNM parameters in radical prostatectomy was identified. However, dispersive analysis didn't reveal significant differences of prostate cancer morphological features in patients groups with threshold values (ng/mL) PSA < 1, PSA = 1-4 and PSA > 4. ERG expression was detected only in cases with a PSA > 4. But the significant correlation of AMACR and ERG expression, PSA level and morphological features wasn't identified in radical prostatectomy material. A high PSA level was an important factor of tumour spread prognosis. So, PSA levels \u226516,08 ng/mL predicted a high risk of extraprostatic invasion and PSA \u2265 26,75 and \u226529,85 ng/ml-the presence of lymph node and distant metastases, respectively. Conclusion: Preoperative PSA levels correlated with Gleason score and TNM and had an important clinical significance as a prediction factor of extraprostatic invasion and metastasis . At the same time, prostate cancer from patients with PSA \u2264 4 ng/mL was ERG-negative, but wasn't a less aggressive compared with that from patients with PSA > 4 ng/ml by morphological features. Objective: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm thought to have originated from smooth muscle. They account for approximately 7 % of soft tissue malignancies. LMS's are generally seen in middle-aged and elderly patients, often located in uterus or gastrointestinal organs and constitute the majority of sarcomas developing from large vessels in the retroperitoneum. Male genitourinary LMS's are rare. We report an unusual case of scrotal leiomyosarcoma. Method: A 62 year old male presented with mass in the right scrotum. Clinical preoperative findings were consistent with lipoma. An exicisional biopsy was performed. Macroscopically there was solid nodular mass with 2.5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.5 cm dimensions. Cut surface was yellow in color with centrally creamy white area. In the microscopical examination, the lesion was a mesenchymal neoplasm composed of spindle cells with cigar shaped nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. There were nuclear pleomorphism and focal necrosis. Neoplastic cells displayed diffuse smooth muscle actin and caldesmon expression immunohistochemically. Desmin and EMA were focally positive. Stains for Pan-cytokeratin, S-100, CD34 and CD68 were negative. Ki-67 proliferation index was 50 %. Results: The final diagnosis was high grade LMS. Conclusion: LMSs can lead to significant clinical difficulty due to its wide differential diagnosis and rarity. Objective: Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) classified as a soft-tissue vascular tumour arising from pericytes, which arranged around capillaries and postcapillary venules and modulate blood flow and permeability.",

A considerable proportion of patients exhibits hypertension, hypoglycemia or additional paraneoplastic syndromes. Method: We report an uncommon case of bilateral metastatic renal HPC accompanying hypoglycemia and hypertension in a 52-year-old male. He had a history of mandibular HPC, and subsequent lung metastasis noted include bilateral renal HPC 5 years after initial presentation. Results: To our knowledge, this is the third reported case of bilateral metastatic renal HPC. After bilateral nephrectomy and the complete resection of the tumour the patient's blood pressure and blood glucose level returned to normal also with the influence of chemotherapy. During 2 years after surgery and chemotherapy, the patient had no evidence of hypertension and hypoglycemia. Whereas after 3 years the patient had come with stubborn hypoglycemia. Radiologic examination of the whole body revealed multiple metastasis both in liver and lung. Therefore, pazopanib therapy given to the patient for tumour recurrence and steroid therapy added for the control of stubborn hypoglycemia. The patient died 1 year after the second recurrence of the disease. Conclusion: The present case indicated that surgery with chemotherapy provides satisfactory outcomes and appears to control the paraneoplastic syndromes in renal HPC. Furthermore, the present case showed the strong effect of corticosteroid therapy, which ameliorated symptoms of hypoglycemia. Objective: To review a peculiar reaction in urinary bladder associated with inflammatory changes and poorly understood pathogenesis, developing benign glandular foci of metaplastic prostatic tissue. Method: Two cases of prostatic metaplasia of the urinary bladder were studied from a males of 37 and 68 years of age. Both were located at the dome of the bladder, with a size of 4 and 3 mm. One of them was closely situated to a small foci of superficial papillary urotelial carcinoma. Immunohistochemical studied was perform to assess the prostatic nature of the lesions. Results: Lesions were composed by closely packed glandular acini lined with two cell types, flat basal cells and cylindrical luminal cells. Nearby von Brunn nest could be seen and a glandular change evolving into the clearly developed prostatic glands. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was intensely positive, with p63 expression in basal layer. Cytokeratin 7 and 20 expression was seen with heterogeneous pattern. Alpha-methylacyl-CoA-racemase was weakly positive in one case. Conclusion: A few cases of ectopic prostatic tissue are describe in bladder wall. The metaplastic change we present in transition with inflammatory reaction and von Brun nests is probably an underreported change similar to the other metaplastic lesions commonly seen in the bladder. Results: A 52-year-old woman consulted for a right low back pain, without palpable mass. CT scan showed an adrenal well limited mass, measuring 11 cm which wasn't secreting on biology. The patient underwent a right adrenalectomy. At macroscopic examination, the mass was a well limited and encapsulated with a fleshy texture. It was lobulated and showed edematous, congestive and necrotic changes. Histological examination revealed a well-demarcated proliferation made of fairly monomorphic spindle cells arranged in short bundles or sometimes storiform and often without particular organization. The general appearance is heterogeneous with presence of densely cellular territories, alternating abruptly with less cellular territories of hyaline fibrosis or edematous or myxoid areas. The set is supplied by a vascular network where branched vessels sometimes adopting a staghorn morphology. There wasn't a significant pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The necrosis was rather ischemic. By immunohistochemistry, tumour cells expressed intensely and diffusely CD34. Conclusion: The clinical course of SFTs has always been a problem. The malignancy criteria vary depending on the series and tumour location. The pleomorphism, hypercellularity and mitotic index (>4 mitoses per 10GCF) are mainly the indicators of a poor prognosis.",

Method: A 61-year-old man with history of colorectal cancer underwent nephrectomy for left kidney tumour measuring 20 mm in diameter. Tumour involved cortex and medulla. Histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical staining for CK7, CK20, CDX2, PAX8, betacatenin and GATA3 was performed. Results: The tumour was composed of well-formed or cribriform glands of intestinal type adenocarcinoma and invaded cortex and medulla. Desmoplastic stroma and areas of necrosis were apparent. The tumour grew underneath urothelium or lined focally pelvic mucosa with abrupt transition to the normal urothelium. Some renal tubules were lined with dysplastic columnar epithelium, resembling in-situ carcinoma. There was expression of CK20, CDX2 and beta-catenin (weak membranous positivity) in the main tumour, in-situ tubular component and tumoural lining of the pelvis. PAX8 and CK7 was expressed in surrounding renal tubules or urothelium, no expression in tumour nor in situ component was seen. GATA3 was expressed in urothelial lining of the pelvis only. The diagnosis of metastatic colorectal carcinoma was established, excluding the possibility of collecting duct carcinoma or primary enteric type adenocarcinoma arising in urothelium. Conclusion: It is important to remember the possible involvement of preexisting epithelial structures in metastatic cancer. Such a finding may mislead the diagnosis and falsely point to primary cancer of the involved organ-in our particular case the kidney. Objective: Amyloidosis is a disorder with mainly extracellular deposition of misfolded protein. It can be primary, secondary or hereditary and the deposits can be systemic or localized. Amyloidosis of the bladder is a rare condition and generally localized. It mimics urothelial carcinoma clinically, cystoscopically, and radiologically.",

            "text": "Method: 63 years old woman was admitted to our hospital with macroscopic hematuria in 2013. On computed tomography, posterolateral and superior part of the bladder wall showed 2 cm thickness which was suspicious for tumour. Cystoscopy showed irregulary areas in the posterolateral side of the bladder. Curetted material was obtained by transurethral resection of bladder. Results: Biopsies revealed dense homogenous eosinophillic material in the lamina propria which stained orange red on congo red stain and showed apple green birefringence on polarization. There was no evidence of urothelial carcinoma or carcinoma insitu. There were no signs of systemic amyloidosis at the time of diagnosis and during the 36 months of follow-up. Conclusion: Amyloidosis of the bladder is a rare condition which can be easily confused with urothelial carcinoma because of its appearance on imaging as well as on cystoscopy. Histological examination is a requirement for definitive diagnosis. Objective: Mantle cell lymphoma of the prostate, primary or secondary, is rare. Less than a hundred cases have been reported in the literature. This scarcity is causing the delay in diagnosis usually done at the advanced stage of the tumour. Method: We report the case of a 67 year old man with no medical history, the history of his symptoms back to 4 months before admission by the installation of dysuria. Ultrasound revealed a prostatic hypertrophy. The patient had a resection by bladder size. Histological examination concluded prostatic localization of a mantle cell lymphoma, confirmed by immunohistochemical study. Results: Mantle cell lymphoma of the prostate is often discovered incidentally at autopsy or after surgery. The primary involvement of the prostate is rarely reported unlike secondary locations. The average age is 62 years. The clinical symptoms are nonspecific. Imaging is also nonspecific. The diagnosis is histological based on prostate biopsy. This is a malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma Small cell, cells are monomorphic with sometimes indented nuclei. Tumour cells usually express CD20, CD5 and Cyclin-D1. Conclusion: The prostate localization of mantle cell lymphoma is unusual and rare. Therapeutic consensus is not established. In first line, the teams propose chemotherapy in combination or not with radiotherapy. Objective: Primary T-cell lymphoma of male urethra is an extremely rare location for this type of cancer. We report the case of a 68 years old male patient who presented to the hospital with urinary obstruction symptoms that started 2 months prior. Clinical exam describes an urethral obstructive mass. Therefore, segmental penile urethrectomy is performed. Method: Surgical specimen was grossly examined and processed in the pathology department. Hematoxylin eosin and van Gieson colored slides were examined under the microscope. CD3, CD25, CD30, CD20 and Tdt markers were used for immunohistochemistry study. Results: Histopathology exam reveals a diffuse neoplastic proliferation with lymphoid features. The cells are medium sized, pleomorphic with vesicular nuclei, 2-3 small nucleoli and high mitotic index. The tumour involves male urethra and infiltrates cavernous bodies. The patient doesn't complaints about other signs and symptoms. Lab and imagistic results are within normal range. Tumour cells are positive for CD3 and CD25, with negative results for CD 30 and Tdt. Conclusion: Primary T-cell lymphoma of male urethra is a rare form of cancer with less than 5 cases reported in the literature. The tumour is extremely aggressive and can extend to the surrounding structures in a short period of time stressing the need for prompt diagnosis and therapy.",

Method: We report five cases of adrenal ML over 10 years from 2006 to 2016. A retrospective study was done by reviewing medical records. Demographic, imaging and clinicopathologic features are presented. Results: All patients were women. The mean age was 45 years, with ages ranging from 23 to 59 years. Four patients were diagnosed incidentally with a unilateral ML. The fifth patient presented bilateral ML revealed by flank pain. Initial diagnosis was based on imagery. All patients underwent a surgical resection. Definitive diagnosis was made by pathologic findings that showed adrenal gland tumour comprising mature adipose tissue with bone marrow elements. Follow-up of all patients showed no recurrence. Conclusion: The origin of ML remains unclear. Some theories have been discussed, including remnants of foetal bone marrow or misplaced haematopoietic cells. It is confirmed by histopathologic examination.

Method: The clinicopathological features of a case of PSEFK are described, with a review of the literature. Results: A 12-year-old girl underwent nephrectomy for a 5 cm right renal tumour. Grossly, it was firm and well circumscribed. Histologically it was a spindle and epithelioid cell tumour with eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm, moderate atypia and a densely hyalinised stroma with entrapped hyperplastic renal tubules. Mesoblastic nephroma and mixed epithelial-stromal tumour were considered initially, but upon review of the literature, PSEFK was recognized as the most likely diagnosis. Positivity for MUC4 and the presence of rearrangement of the EWSR1 gene confirmed the diagnosis. Seven other cases have been described to date, one of them with similar histological features.

Immunohistochemical study was performed using the monoclonal antibody anti-HLA-G. Five groups of expression marked HLA expression semi-quantitatively. Results: Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in four stages in our groups. HLA-G expression was positive in 68.5 % of cases. This positivity was assessed in 70 % of patients with stage I, 66.7 % of stage II patients, in 53.3 % of patients with stage III and in 81.8 % of patients with stage IV. These differences are not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The expression was intense and diffuse 7.4 % (4+ score). However, the level of HLA-G expression was significantly higher in I and IV stages in comparison with the other stages (p <0.0001). Conclusion: HLA-G was expressed in approximately half of ovarian carcinoma patients",

Results: Bone marrow was infiltrated with 30 % of medium sized atypical plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction and 10 % of larger multinucleated plasma cells with kappa light chain restriction. All plasma cells were positive for CD138 and CD117 but negative for CD20 and CD56. Lambda to kappa ratio was 5 to 1. Lambda positive plasma cells were also positive for Bcl-2 and Cyclin-D1, while kappa positive plasma cells were negative for both. Bone marrow biopsy revealed two morphologically and immunohistochemically distinct plasma cell populations, one expressing lambda and the other expressing kappa light chains, while serum protein electrophoresis identified only one IgG M-protein and no light chain restriction. Conclusion: Biclonal PCMs producing two different types of immunoglobulins are rare",

Case1 was 79 year-old Japanese female, who suffered from rapid swelling of the right buccal region. The tumour resection was performed. Local recurrence and multiple lung metastases occurred 2 months after operation, and she died. Case 2 is 63 year-old Japanese male, who suffered from the pain of the right mandible. The bulky tumour of the oral floor replaced the tongue and invaded to mandible. X-P showed multiple metastases to the left lymph nodes and bone. He died. Histologically, both tumours showed vascular channel-like structures by atypical cells, and some areas consisted of proliferation of spindle cells or hobnail cells. Immunohsitochemically, the tumour cells were positive for cytokeratins, p40 and vimentin, whereas they showed loss. Conclusion: PAC is exceeding rare and it is an extreme phenotype of ASCC, like \"angiosarcoma",

Case 2: A 34-year-old male patient with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and a 27 mm left jugular foramen tumour showing bone erosion on imaging. Results: Microscopic examination showed, in both cases, a tumour composed of papillary formations and tubular structures. The lining was single-layered, cuboidal with very mild atypia. Mitoses were scarce in the 1st case and inconspicuous in the 2nd. Immunostaining showed that the tumour cells expressed CK7, EMA, and focally GFAP. The proliferation index (Ki67) was low.

Cytology of the biliar tract was inconclusive. Imaging studies i c duodenopancreatectomy was performed. Results: Macroscopically, a diffuse thickening of biliary ducts was prominent, involving the intra and extra-hepatic portions and also the pancreatic duct, with focal stenosis. Histologically there was a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, with a IgG4+/IgG+ plasmocyte ratio >40 %; there was also an abundant eosinophilic infiltrate and fibrosis, occasionally with a storiform pattern; no neoplastic tissue was observed. Conclusion: Sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune pancreatitis are a common form of presentation of IgG4-related disease and clinically can mimic malignant neoplasms",

Method: We performed retrospective analysis of the reports of 1220 renal biopsies, received during the 2000-2014 period and concerning 898 patients with an age range between 9 months and 89 years. Results: An adequate sample was obtained in 717 cases. Clinical presentation was either transplant-related (26.0 %) or consisted of nephrotic syndrome (19.8 %), haematuria and/or proteinuria (17.2 %), tumour (7.5 %) or other (29.4 %), including systemic diseases and renal failure.

Method: A total of 39 representative and well preserved biopsies of 7 women and 32 men with small cell lung cancer were randomly incorporated in this study. Chemotherapy treatments were identified from medical records (first-line treatment: etoposide+carboplatin; and second-line treatment: ciclofosfamine+etoposide+epirubicin). Immunohistochemical staining was performed with Bond-Max auto-stainer and mTOR (Ser2448) clone was applied. Results: Mean survival was 205 days and only 8 patients (20.5 %) remained alive 1 year after diagnosis. Patients expressing positive mTOR had high survival rates (p = 0.01). Patients with positive mTOR or negative ERCC1 expression had longer survival when treated with carboplatin+etoposide (p < 0.05) (unpublished data). Conclusion: In this study patients with positive mTOR had significantly longer survival",

Lymph node metastasis were observed in 13 cases (28,9 %). LRP and MRP-1 expression were higher in all the ADCs compared to non tumoural tissue. No differences were found when comparing histological patterns, between primary tumour and metastasis, or according to smoking habits, gender and age. Conclusion: MRP export organic anions and are related to cytotoxic and antiviral drugs resistance. LRP expression is related to cisplatin resistance",

No gland formation or other differentiating features were observed. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were positive for vimentin, pancytokeratin (KerAE1/AE3), low molecular weight cytokeratin (Ker8/18), thyroid transcriptional factor-1 (TTF-1), high molecular weight cytokeratin (Ker34\u03b2E12) and p63 protein.

Authors aimed to study ERCC1 expressionin lung adenocarcinomas (ADC), according to histological patterns. Method: A series of 45 lung ADCs were studied. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed according to Streptavidin-Biotin protocol for ERCC1 antibody. Intensity and percentage of stained cells were registered. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney was performed using STASTISTICA 7 software. Results: Acinar pattern was present in 42 (93,3 %) cases, bronchiolo-alveolar pattern in 25 (55,5 %) cases, solid pattern in 18 (40 %) cases, papillary pattern in 7 (15,5 %) cases, and micropapillary pattern in 15 (33,3 %) cases. Lower ERCC1 expression was identified in acinar (p = 0,0016) and papillary (p = 0,019) patterns, compared to non-tumoural tissue. Papillary pattern showed lower expression compared to solid (p = 0,043) and BA/lepidic patterns (p = 0,044)",

Method: Nineteen CCRCC with low-grade metastases have been retrospectively collected and representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of both primary and metastatic tumours retrieved in each case for microscopic evaluation. Tissue microarrays were performed for the immunohistochemical analysis. Results: Males predominated in the series (12M/7F) Tumour size between 2 and 12 cm. Twelve cases were organ-confined and seven nonorgan confined. Metastases were all G1 or G2. One case metastasized three times and two cases did it twice. Elapsed time from primary to metastasis oscillated between 0 and 204 months. Twelve patients died of disease . Three patients are alive with disease and four are alive without disease. E-Cadherin expression was lost in 15 primaries and 16 metastases while N-Cadherin was expressed only in one primary and two metastases. Cadherins switching (E-Cadherin negative/N-Cadherin positive) was not detected in the primaries while reversal switching (E-Cadherin positive/N-Cadherin negative) was observed in two metastases",

The patient had poor compliance to the therapy and the disease relapsed, showing osteolytic lesions and a rise in seric prostate specific antigen (1416 ng/ml). Results: Echocardiography showed a massive hemopericardium, which cytologic examination revealed epithelial malignant cells negative for PSA, but unexpectedly positive for TTF-1 and CK7 immunostains. These findings, together with the imaging results, were highly suspicious of an occult primary lung carcinoma, so an atypical lung ressection was performed. Histologically, two components were identified: one cribriform, PSA positive, TTF1 and CK7 negative; the other predominantly solid, PSA negative, TTF1 and CK7 positive. These distinct properties were diagnostic of a primary lung adenocarcinoma being metastised by a prostate adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is one of the few reports of a tumour to tumour metastasis, namely a prostatic adenocarcinoma metastising to a lung adenocarcinoma",

The volume of anaplastic component was ranged from 5 to 20 %. In the cells of anaplastic component IHC revealed: SMA, vim, p63. At the same time in separate anaplastic cells marked loss of expression of panCK and CK 7, EMA. In all cases there were negative membrane and cytoplasmic expression of the protein E-cadherin in AC. Molecular analysis showed that AC was characterized by coordinated changes in expression levels of genes with increasing of ZEB1, ZEB2, VIM and significant decreasing of CDH1. Conclusion: Heterogeneity of PDAC is manifested by appearance of anaplastic (sarcoma like) component, in which epithelial tumour cells acquire properties of mesenchymal cells, and don't require presence of stroma and have an aggressive malignant potential impacting on survival of patients.

Method: An E\u03bc-Myc transgenic mouse cell line was crossed with a mouse cell line harboring conditional deletion of NFATc1 to create a cell line in which B cells have Myc over expression and NFATc1 gene deletion. The immunophenotype of E\u03bc-Myc BCLs was analysed by Flow cytometer. The nuclear localization of NFATc1 was assessed by western blotting and confocal microscopy. Analysis of RNA was performed in MYC induced BCLs. Results: The B cell lymphomas developed in E\u03bc-Myc mice showed an immature B-cell phenotype with constitutive nuclear localization of NFATc1. NFATc1 was also overexpressed and localized in the nuclei of human BCL cell lines. These findings suggest that NFATc1 expression is of importance in the pathogenesis of BCLs. Increased apoptosis in tumour cells with abolished NFATc1 indicates that NFATc1 is essential for the survival of tumour cells. In MYC induced BCLs, NFATc1 protein expression is regulated by post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. Conclusion: NFATc1 has an important role in the pathogenesis and survival of BCL. Our findings showed that this component of the CNdependent Ca2+/NFAT signalling pathway may be a promising target in therapeutic strategies of B cell lymphomas.

Method: surgical material from six patients 11-24 years old with TS and mosaicism in serum and gonadal tissue was studied. Immunohistochemistrical detection of Ki-67, Vimentin, Desmin, Inhibin-a, AR, ER. The tissue karyotype (TK) and SRY-gene has been detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction, the serum karyotype (SK)-cytogenetically. Data processing: Statistica 7.0. Results: Two patients with gonadoblastoma have had 45X/46XY SK and XO, XY TK, and SRY-gene in gonadal tissue (GT). Two patients with dygenetical gonads and fragments of ovarian tissue: 45X/46XX SK and XO TK, the SRY-gene is in one case-in GT. Two other patients with streak-gonads: 45X/46XY SK and XO/XY, XO/XY/XYY TK, the SRYgene is in both cases-one in serum and another one is in GT. Immunohistochemistrically: streak-gonads-high expression of Vimentin and low of all rest. DGOT-high expression of ER; DGGB-high expression of Inhibin-a, ki-67. Conclusion: karyotype in TS correlates (r = 0,32-0,4; p < 0.05) with different morphology. In two patients with absence of Ychromosome the SRY-gene was detected that in according to science sources is the result of SRY-gene translocation to Xchromosome during meiotic recombination.

Similarly, CD83 was expressed in neoplastic cells of 100 % of CHL (11/11), 93 % of GZL(16/  18)  and 43 % (9/21) of PMBL. The number of cases assessed with the two markers was variable because of the unavailability of unstained tissue sections of paraffin blocks in some cases. Conclusion: Fascin and CD83 are very sensitive markers for CHL but they are not specific. Negative results would support PMBL or GZL over CHL. A large panel of immunohistochemical markers is still recommended to distinguish the three entities, in which fascin and CD83 are of additive value.PS-11-003 CD30 and IgG4 are useful diagnostic markers of sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen W.-C. Chang * * MacKay Memorial Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Taipei, TaiwanObjective: Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) is a benign but rare lesion of the spleen, and the etiology is still unknown. In this study, we investigate the usefulness of CD30 and IgG4 as potential diagnostic markers. Method: We collected various vascular tumours of the spleen, including hemangioma, lymphangioma, littoral cell angioma, splenic hamartoma, Kaposi sarcoma, angiosarcoma, and SANT. The expression of CD30 on endothelial and stromal cells and the number of IgG4+ plasma cells are evaluated. Results: SANT exhibited expression of CD30 (1\u223c3+) on the endothelial and stromal cells, whereas none of the other vascular lesions expressed CD30 on the endothelial or stromal cells. The average number of IgG4+ plasma cells and IgG4 ratio were significantly higher in SANT compared to the other splenic vascular lesions. Conclusion: Our study showed that the combination of CD30 and IgG4 immunostains can be helpful in distinguishing SANT from other vascular lesions of the spleen. The expression of CD30+ endothelial and stromal cells and high IgG4+ plasma cell count also suggests that SANT might be a form of IgG4-related sclerosing disease.PS-11-004Evaluation of P53 protein expression in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS): Prognostic impact E.

Kitamura, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is monoclonally integrated into about 80 % of MCCs. JAK-STAT signaling activation is associated with some cancers. Therefore, we first evaluated the relationship of JAK-STAT signaling expressions to MCPyV-infection and prognosis in MCCs. Method: 50 MCC tumours (30 MCPyV-positive and 20 MCPyVnegative cases) were assessed immunohistochemically for expressions of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, p-MEK1/2 and p-Erk1/2, respectively, using Allred score. Clinicopathological data were analyzed statistically with SPSS software. Results: p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were expressed in 48/50 (96 %) and 39/49 (80 %) MCCs, respectively but not different between MCPyV-positive and -negative MCCs. Allred scores of p-MEK1/2 and p-Erk1/2 expression were significantly higher and lower in MCPyV-positive MCCs than MCPyV-negative ones (p = 0.002, p = 0.019, respectively). These JAK-STAT signals were not associated with OS or DSS of MCCs. However, in MCPyV-positive MCCs, strong intensity (IS; 2 or 3) of p-MEK1/2 was significantly associated with unfavorable OS (p = 0.031). Conclusion: We first demonstrated the significant association of higher p-MEK1/2 and lower p-Erk1/2 expression with MCPyV-positive MCC, and of higher p-MEK1/2 intensity score with poor prognosis only in MCPyV-positive subgroup.

The emergence of cytogenetic profiling may be helpful in identifying genetic subgroups associated with poor prognosis. PD-1/PD-L1 pathway assists tumour evasion from the immune system. We examined the expression of PD-L1 in invasive squamous cell carcinoma(INSCC) of the skin and adjacent in situ squamous cell carcinoma (ISSCC), actinic keratosis (AK) and normal skin (NS) to evaluate for possible PD-L1 implication in tumour progression. Method: Paraffin tissue sections from INSCC (n = 114) were stained for PD-L1. The expression on epithelial cells and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes/dendritic cells was evaluated using Allred score. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Results: ISSCC, AK and NS were observed adjacent to INSCC, in 43, 112 and 112 cases, respectively. PD-L1 epithelial cell expression was higher in INSCC compared to ISSCC, AK and NS (p = 0.025, p < 0.005 and p < 0.005, respectively) and in ISSCC and AK compared to NS (p = 0.039 and p = 0.034). PD-L1 lymphocytic/dendritic cell expression was higher in INSCC compared to ISSCC, AK and NS (p < 0.005 for all the comparisons), in ISSCC and AK compared to NS (p < 0.005 for all the comparisons) and in ISSCC compared to AK (p = 0.039). Conclusion: There is a gradual increase in PD-L1 expression during the progression from non-neoplastic skin to INSCC, through AK and ISSCC, implicating its participation in the neoplastic evolution.

They are affected in GI motor disorders including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. However, morphology of ICC network isn't sufficiently characterized in colitis. Aims: to assess the morphological changes of the ICC-MY in the distal colon using a murine model of acute ulcerative colitis. Method: Acute colitis was induced in adult male C57Bl/6 mice by 3 % aqueous solution of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, 40 kDa). Histological sections of distal colon were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. ICC-MY were marked in the whole mount of colon muscular layer with the anti c-Kit monoclonal antibody (ACK4). Digital images were obtained with fluorescence microscopy and analyzed with the ImageJ software. Results: DSS caused acute inflammation of the distal colon with extensive mucosal ulceration. Vacuolar alterations of smooth muscle cells were found. In control group colonic ICC-MY formed a tight network. In mice with ulcerative colitis there was a decrease in number of cells and in length of their processes. The network density decreased by 20-30 % in colitis. Also specific granularity appeared in some of ICC-MY. Conclusion: There are morphological changes of colonic ICC-MY, which includes a decrease in their number and a damage of their process.PS-16-051The immune score in patients with colorectal cancer: A possible approach for classification and prediction outcome A.

Kim, S.-J. Jang, S.-M. Hong * Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Seoul, Republic of KoreaObjective: Tumour budding in CRCs is a notable histologic feature associated with an adverse outcome and aggressive histopathologic findings, such as lymphovascular tumour emboli (LVE), perineural invasion (PNI), and an infiltrative growth pattern. We aimed to investigate the associations between molecular alterations and clinicopathologic parameters including tumour budding. Method: We examined KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutations in 90 CRCs using a multi-gene panel with the Sequenom MassARRAY technology platform and analyzed the results. Results: The incidences of KRAS, PIK3CA, NRAS, BRAF and TP53 mutations were 42.2 %, 12.2 %, 1.1, 2.2, and 23.3 %, respectively. A high tumour budding grade was correlated with KRAS mutations (p < 0.001). In addition, KRAS codon 12 and PIK3CA exon 9 mutations were associated with a high tumour budding grade (p = 0.016 and 0.006, respectively). LVE and PNI were correlated with KRAS mutations in exon 3 and 4 (p = 0.044 and 0.049, respectively). The median disease free survival of patients with PIK3CA mutant tumours in exon 9 was shorter than those of patients without PIK3CA mutation (28.3 vs 47.7 months, p = 0.030). Conclusion: Our results show the associations between certain KRAS or PIK3CA mutations and aggressive clinicopathologic findings such as high tumour budding grade, LVE, and PNI.PS-16-061 SATB2 is a promising biomarker for identifying colorectal origin in liver metastatic adenocarcinoma M.-Y.

Method: Investigated the bodies of 13 dead newborns at the age from 2 h to 28 days. Before the autopsy was carried out postmortem 3T MRI in T2 mode at sagittal projection. We determined the optical density of the right and left lung (DL), pleural fluid (DF) and calculated the airiness indicator of the lung tissue in both lungs (DF/DL). During the autopsy performed macroscopic, microscopic and microbiological examinations of the lungs. Results: Based on the results of morphological studies in 9 deaths of newborns was diagnosed bilateral focal-drain pneumonia. In 4 cases the causes of death were congenital malformations. At postmortem MRI the development of neonatal pneumonia accompanied by a decrease in the airiness indicator (DF/DL) less than 2.5 in both lungs. Indicators of the diagnostic value of postmortem MRI were as follows: sensitivity-88.9 %, specificity-100 %, overall accuracy-92.3 %.

Method: The distribution of SC-GCTs in relation to histological category (mature, immature, malignant), age and sex was analyzed in children aged 0-18 years diagnosed and treated in Mother and Child Health Care Institute of Serbia during 38-year period (1977-2014). Results: There were 71 SC-GCTs out of 259 GCTs in our series (27.4 %). It was by far the most frequent GCT in extragonadal localizations (71/110; 64.5 %). Fifty percent of SC-GCTs were diagnosed in the first month of life. Only 14 % of SC-GCTs were malignant in the first year of life and the youngest patient with the malignant form being 11-month-old baby. By contrast, 57 % of these tumours were malignant in children older than 1 year. Male to female ratio was 1 : 2.55. Conclusion: The relative frequency and distribution of SC-GCTs by histologic category, age and sex in our series was in accordance with the relevant summary data from the literature. Our results emphasize the importance of diagnozing and resection of SC-GCTs in the first months of life.PS-19-025 Molecular characterisation of a disseminated congenital melanoma with unexpected long term survival E.

Given the increasing number of clinically-relevant gene aberrations, single gene analyses are being outdated. NGS panels allow to simultaneously assess many cancer-related genes. We aim to evaluate the performance of CE-IVD NGS \"Oncomine Solid Tumour DNA kit\" (OST) in a single-center molecular diagnostic practice. Method: We evaluated the OST panel (22 genes) on Ion Torrent\u2122 NGS platform in previously analyzed retrospective and prospective cohorts of NSCLC and CADK (n = 90 and n = 100, respectively). Results: We confirmed all the known gene alterations of the retrospective group and we identified additional gene mutations (range 2-4) in 68 samples (75.6 %). Eighty-five prospective samples displayed adequate DNA quantity for NGS analyses. Clinically-relevant gene mutations were detected in 75 % of these samples. All the mutations were validated with RT-PCR-based techniques. Conclusion: NGS OST offered a greater numbers of clinically-relevant information with low DNA input and in a single batch, reducing time and costs of single gene evaluations. Although skilled personnel are required, this procedure provided a higher throughput of mutations in potentially actionable genes.

Of utmost importance will be the analysis of resistance mutations in advanced lung cancer patients under treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). One of the main challenges in the adaptation of ctDNA assays is evaluating technical sensitivity of the specific detection method; because the amount of ctDNA may be underrepresented in a background of cell free DNA (cfDNA) of non-cancer origin. Method: The genetically defined Horizon Quantitative Multiplex and cfDNA Reference Standards were used in our laboratory to establish the molecular detection workflow and to validate the technical sensitivity for the detection of mutations with low-allelic burden. Results: The expected allelic frequencies of mutations including EGFR (p.\u0394E746-750, p.V769-D770insASV, p.T790M, p.L858R), KRAS (p.G12D), NRAS (p.A59T, p.Q61K) and PIK3CA (p.E545K) were detected reproducibly with a custom-made targeted NGS panel for liquid biopsies which comprises hot-spot regions from 7 genes. The limit of detection of ctDNA assays (5, 1 and 0.1 %) were established.

Cancer Research, Heidelberg, Germany Objective: Accelerated cell cycle is often associated with aggressive tumour behaviour and poor disease prognosis. Giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) is a locally aggressive osteolytic lesion, in which neoplastic stromal cells drive osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction. We studied the link between cell cycle progression marker expressions of the mononuclear cell fraction and progression-free survival (PFS) in GCTB. Method: Duplicate tissue microarray samples of 154 cases (primary/recurrence 100/54) from 139 patients with a total of 40 progression events were immunostained for cell cycle markers and scored in digital slides. DNA index (ploidy) was measured with flow cytometry. Survival analyses were performed using Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) gap-time models. Results: In univariate analysis, ploidy (p < 0.0001) and the proportion of MCM2 (p = 0.016), cyclin D1 (p = 0.022), cyclin A (p < 0.001) and geminin (p = 0.015) positive cells showed significant association with PFS. The Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based best prognostic model (AIC = 271.6) included ploidy (HR = 6.20 [2.89-13.30], p < 0.0001), cyclin D1 (HR = 2.27 [1.10-4.71], p = 0.0274), MCM2 (HR = 2.64 [0.86-8.08], p = 0.0901); the second best (AIC = 271.8) also involved cyclin A (HR = 1.62 [0.81-3.23], p = 0.1732). Cell cycle phase progression was reflected by the positive association between gradually increasing hazards and elevated post-G1/S-phase cell fractions. Conclusion: Testing for ploidy and cell cycle progression markers can assist in selecting GCTB patients with high-risk of progression.",

Method: Study included 40 cases of urothelial tumours of urinary bladder. Immunohistochemical evaluation of Ki67 and Her2neu was done using streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method. Staining and evaluation using specific polyclonal antibody to Ki67 and Her2neu was done. Results: The Ki67 expression had significant association with tumour histological grade (p = 0.024) and muscle invasion (p = 0.021). The association of Her2neu expression had significant association with tumour histological grade (p = 0.001) and muscle invasion(p = 0.001). Muscle invasive tumours showed high expression of Ki67 (70.6 %) as compared to non-muscle invasive tumours (30 %). Her2neu over expression was in accordance with grade, 31.3, 60 and 93 % of low, intermediate and high grade respectively. Co-expression of both markers was demonstrated in 25 % of low, 40 % of intermediate and 78.8 % of high grade.In muscle invasive tumours 70.6 % showed co-expression as compared to non muscle invasive tumours(30.4 %). Conclusion: Ki67 and Her2neu expression correlated well with tumour grade and progression.

The mutation hot spots are positions \u2212124 and \u2212146 bp from ATG start site, which affected 64.5 % of the 327 bladder cancer. The purpose of this study was to test the ratio of TERT promoter mutations of urothelial carcinoma in Korean patients. Method: Direct sequencing was done in 142 paraffin-embedded urothelial carcinoma tissues and 69 cases of urine cytology samples. The tissues of urothelial carcinoma were 51 low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (LGPUC), 39 high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (HGPUC), and 52 invasive urothelial carcinoma (IUC). The cytology samples were 28 benign atypia or borderline, and 41 malignancy. Results: The tissue revealed mutation in 21.6 % of LGPUC, 23.1 % of HGPUC, and 3.1 % of IUC. None of the 28 negative or benign atypia cytology samples revealed mutation. The 41 cytology samples of malignancy showed mutation ratio of 26.8 %. The overall mutation ratio of urothelial carcinoma was 18.0 %. Conclusion: The TERT promoter mutation ratio of the urothelial carcinoma in Korean was lower than other ethnic groups.PS-25-027Evaluation of Muc1 and P53 expressions in noninvasive papillary urothelial neoplasms of bladder, their relationship with tumour grade and role in the differential diagnosis E.

Ayedi * Centre Hosp. Univ. Habib Bourguiba, Dept. de Pathologie, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) of the prostate represent a multivarious group of tumours that exist both in pure forms and associated with prostatic adenocarcinoma. Our aim is to evaluate pathological features of NET of the prostate. Method: Twenty cases of NET of the prostate diagnosed in the pathology department of university hospital Sfax (TUNISIA), were collected from January 2003 to December 2015. Results: Prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (ANED) accounted for 70 % of cases. Small cells neuroendocrine carcinoma (SNEC) accounted for 25 %. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LNEC) was diagnosed in one patient aged 76 years. The Mean age at diagnosis was 62.7 years (range: 18-83) for ANED and 76.75 years (range: 70-81) for SNEC. Serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were higher than10 ng/ml in all cases. Histologically, the proportion of neuroendocrine differentiation ranged from 20 to 90 % in ANED and from 5 to 70 % in 2 cases of mixed SNEC. Chromogranin and/or synaptophysin immunostaining were positive in all cases. PSA immunostaining was positive in 66 % of SNEC, 100 % of ANED and LNEC. Conclusion: It is important to continue to study NET of the prostate to either validate or dispute their predictive clinical significance and therapeutic implications.

Further studies are needed to investigate the biology and clinical implication of PTEN in NI-LGPUC. Sertoli cell tumour is a rare type of sex-cord stromal tumours of the testis. It accounts for less than 1 % of all testicular neoplasms. It is classified into three main variants by WHO. These are Sertoli cell tumour, not otherwise specified; large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumour; and sclerosing Sertoli cell tumour (SSCT). The later being an exceedingly rare variant. Method: Case report: A 48-year old Saudi man presented with infertility. On physical examination, he had a left scrotal mass without any nodal or distant metastases. Orchiectomy was done, and a rubbery white tan nodule about 2 CM in diameter was found within the left testis. Results: Microscopic examination revealed a tumour with areas of sclerosis and hyalinization, composed of cords, nests and trabeculae of uniform cells with small rounded nuclei, finely granular chromatin, small nucleoli, and modest amount of pale or slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. No mitotic figures, nuclear atypia or necrosis were noted. The differential diagnosis included seminoma, neuro-endocrine tumour, lymphoma, Leydig cell tumour and other sex cord tumours. Immunohistochemical markers for germ cell tumours, neuroendocrine tumours, lymphoma, and sex cord tumours were all negative. The tumour stained positive only for vimentin.Conclusion: This unusual and rare tumour posed a diagnostic dilemma. The vimentin positive only staining added to the difficulty in diagnosing it. Review of recent literature, and finding that several similar tumours stained only for vimentin, and the sclerotic nature of the tumour made it possible to reach the diagnosis.

Treatment suggestions based on an approximation of these subtypes by immunohistochemical criteria have been published by the St Gallen international expert consensus panel. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can be classified into the same molecular subtypes. Our aim was to study the relation between these newly defined subtypes and prognosis in DCIS. Method: Retrospective study of 21 cases of breast pure DCIS collected over a 13 year period(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010). The cases were classified into four molecular subtypes according to the recommendations of St. Gallen. Results: The DCIS were Luminal A in (33 %), Luminal B in (15 %), HER2 in (37 %) and triple negative in (15 %). Mean period of follow-up was 5.2 years(1-14 years). Invasive local recurrence with bone metastases were noted in 2 cases, and 5 to 6 years, respectively: a case Luminal phenotype A and a case of luminal phenotype B.Conclusion: Our results have demonstrated the prognostic value of molecular classification of DCIS.

To identify the differentiating features from other benign & malignant cells. To review the literature on malignant melanoma of female genital tract. Method: A 42 year old lady presented to gynaecology outpatient department with complaints of brownish vaginal discharge. Per speculum examination showed a mass in upper vagina. A screening conventional cervical cytology smear was taken, stained with papanicolaou stain and observed under microscope. Results: The microscopy showed loose aggregates as well as dispersed population of intermediate to large sized cells with nuclear pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli and abnormal mitoses. Few cells showed brownish cytoplasmic pigment. The squamous and endocervical cells appeared benign along with dense neutrophilic infiltration and a dirty background. A suspicion of malignant melanoma was given. Biopsy from the mass supported the diagnosis. The cells were positive for S-100 and HMB-45, and a final diagnosis of vaginal malignant melanoma was rendered. Conclusion: The eyes see what the mind knows. The possibility of malignant melanoma should be considered if the cyto-morphology is suggestive. Diagnosis on cytology is especially difficult for amelanotic melanoma. In low resource countries like India, cervical screening programmes are an important means to identify such malignant lesions.E-PS-03-002 Urine analysis of school age children of Dharan Municipality, Nepal S.

The authors propose to study the role of serotonin in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and eczema. Method: Immunohistochemical study was performed to study the expression of serotonin in the lesions of 15 patients with psoriasis, 12 patient with eczema and 10 normal skin specimens. Results: Sex ratio was 1.31 and the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 40 (6-86). Serotonin expression was negative in all normal skin biopsies. Expression of serotonin was significantly strong in the prickle cells, basal cells sweat gland cells and sebaceous gland cells of the lesions of psoriasis in 14 patients. In eczema, strong positivity was found in the prickle cells, basal cells and hair roots for 12 patients. There was no positive expression in the mast cells, collagen fiber, nerve, muscle, Langerhans cells, or epithelial cells of vessels in all of the specimens. Conclusion: Serotonin probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis and activity of skin inflammatory diseases. Immunohistochemestry may be of great interest to guide the treatment of such pathologies.E-PS-04-011 Primary PEComa of the skin: A case report G. Nikolic * , S. Vladisavljevic, L. Antovic, M.

Method: Clinical data have been collected from the medical records of patients and a rereading of slides has been made. The search for the MCV virus was carried out by PCR technique on tumourous tissue samples. Results: The average age at the time of diagnosis was 73,5 years. The cervico-facial locations were the most frequent, 3 patients had ganglionic metastases and 1 patient presented ganglionic and hepatic metastases, 3 patients had developed tumour relapse after surgical resection. Two architectural types were noticed: the form of intermediate cells and the form of small cells. The virological status has been studied as well for the primary tumour as the ganglionic metastases. The prevalence of the MCV virus in our series was 80 %. A positive virological status detected in the primary tumour was also positive in the ganglionic metastases testifying to the stability of the infection by MCV virus and the strong association between it and the Merkel cell carcinoma. Conclusion: The detection of MCV virus could represent an additional tool for the anatomo-pathological diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma.E-PS-04-037 Lymphangioma-like Kaposi Sarcoma: A case report of 3 cases A.

Method: Macroscopic examination followed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the specimen was performed.Results: Gross examination of the specimen showed a 5/4/3.2 cm left thyroid nodule with areas of necrosis without extra thyroidal extension. Tumour histological analysis revealed a predominant component of papillary carcinoma comprising different variants (follicular, solid and oncocytic) associated with a minor component showing spindle cell transformation, pleomorphic features and necrosis. The latter component was diagnosed as anaplastic dedifferentiation. The papillary component showed positivity for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin and CD56 different patterns of expression according to the variant. The anaplastic component showed negativity for all these markers and gain of vimentin expression. Twelve months after surgical resection the patient remained well without clinical and paraclinical evidence for cancer recurrence. Conclusion: This is an unusual case of ATC in that it is combined with a papillary thyroid carcinoma with different morphological variants and which proved to display mild pathologic behavior and relatively longterm patient survival probably due to the presence of a prominent papillary component E-PS-05-004 A rare case of pituitary sarcoidosis L.

Method: A 23 year old black African male presented with an abdominal mass and uncontrolled hypertension. His father and a paternal uncle died from complications secondary to hypertension at less than 35 years of age. The cause of the hypertension had not been investigated. Results: On examination a mass was found extending from the third part of the duodenum to the aorta bifurcation with multiple vertebral metastases. The 24 h urine normetanephrine level was 141 881 nmol/24 h. Histology confirmed a paraganglioma infiltrating the wall of the duodenum. The tumour cells showed loss of expression of SDHB and retention of SDHA expression and Sanger sequencing confirmed a mutation in the SDHB gene. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an African patient with an SDHB associated paraganglioma. Mutations in the SDHB gene are associated with extra-adrenal, abdominal and pelvic paragangliomas and are known to increase the risk of malignancy.

Only a few cases have been reported in living persons and have been considered of no clinical significance. We report a unique case of sebaceous glands in the esophagus diagnosed by endoscopy and biopsy in a 50-year-old woman. Method: The patient history of presented at another hospital with a dysphagia and appetite loss after treatment for fungal change. She came to the Third Central Hospital, Department of Endoscopy complaining of 2 months of unchanged symptoms. Results: Endoscopy revealed multiple small yellowish mucosal nodules scattered throughout the esophagus. Biopsy revealed fragments of squamous esophageal mucosa showing sebaceous gland formation. These glands consisted of units of large polyhedral cells with clear vacuolated cytoplasm. Conclusion: In this case, our patient had no history of GERD. Further studies are required to elucidate the causes and clinicopathological significance of such an unusual epithelial change.

Method: We have evaluated 70 serrated polyps from 58 patients. Histological sections were steined with hematoxylin and eosin and PAS-reaction with alcian blue. After determining the histological type of polyps (sessile serrated adenoma (SSA), traditional serrated adenoma (TSA) and hyperplastic polyps) we selected 36 polyps equal each type for genetic research. Determination of KRAS and BRAF gene mutations was performed by real-time PCR, analytical panel includes a mutation in exon 2,3,4 KRAS and gene mutation BRAF p. V600E. Runs data were processed using software the CFX Manager v 2.1. Results: Serrated lesions were found most frequently in the ascending (25,7 %) part and sigma (20 %) of the colon; sexual differences are not determined. Genetic research has revealed that 50 % of SSA present only BRAF mutation. In 58 % of cases TSA identified mutation KRAS. BRAF mutation was identified in 42 % of HP, KRAS mutation was found in 17 % of HP, and without mutations was 42 % HP.Conclusion: Serrated lesions occur equally in the right and left halves of the colon in both women and men. Gene mutation has been identified at 61 % of the serrated lesions; 25 % had KRAS and 36 % BRAF. E-PS-06-019 Carcinosarcoma of the stomach: A case study T. Kato * , M. Bamba, R. Kushima, S.

Method: The cases were retrieved from the electronic database and were picked up from the institutions slide archives. H&E slides were the elementary objects but the immunohistochemistry slides were examined as well by the authors. Results: The female / male ratio was 1,5:1. The patients were between the ages of 58 and 82. All of our examples were from different localizations which are stomach, choledoch duct, gallbladder, ascending colon and perianal region. The biggest tumour bulk was 8 cm in diameter at the ascending colon with metastatic lymph nodes. The patients distant organ metastasis situation was enabled to identify because the lack of clinical information. Conclusion: MANEC's are rare tumours but they are poorly differentiated malignant neoplasms. From our five patients the longest lived for 8 months only and all had high pT grades. The five tumours all had high grade neuroendocrine components although most of the epithelial components were low grade. The metastasis of the lymph nodes were also neuroendocrine carcinomas.E-PS-06-039 Regression grading in neoadjuvant treated pancreatic cancer: An interobserver study S. Kalimuthu * , S. Serra, N.

Results: Mesothelin positively stained 52 cases. All 117 cases did not react for calretinin, WT-1, and D2-40. The mesothelin expression was be relative to increased degree of pT stage (p = 0.006), AGC (p = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.020), distant metastasis (p = 0.0001), and presence of lymphovascular (p = 0.039) and perineural invasion (p = 0.018). Conclusion: The expression of mesothelin expression was associated with factors of poor prognosis.

GISTs represent 85 % of all mesenchymal neoplasms that affect the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study is to report a case series of 87 GISTs in a single centre and to discuss the diagnostic issues and follow-up results. Method: A retrospective search of unit's archive to collect all cases diagnosed for GISTs between January 2003 to April 2016. The localization, histopathological findings, size, Ki-67 proliferation rates of the tumours, clinical and surgical features, recurrences if any, follow up, and survival of the patients were evaluated. Results: Eighty seven cases of GIST were identified. 44 tumours were located in the stomach, 25 tumours in small bowel, 1 tumour in sigmoid colon, and 1 tumour in rectum. 16 cases involved extra-gastrointestinal locations. The mean age at diagnosis was 63,7 (range 27-93), while the male to female ratio was 0,74 (37 males/50 females). Patients presented with a variety of symptoms. Conclusion: The prognosis of these tumours is unpredictable and the prognosis depends on localization, tumour size and mitoses. Benign tumours have excellent prognosis after surgery, while malignant tumours therapy resistant. Reviewing the variables and relation with the prognostic factors were evaluated according to current literature.

I. Franco Rubio * Hosp. Universitario Miguel Servet, Dept. of Surgical Pathology, Zaragoza, Spain Objective: Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies. Variables studied more often are: the stage (FIGO), nodal status and histology of the primary tumour. There are currently more interest in biomarkers able to predict the evolution of these tumours. Expressions of VEGF and HIF-1 are observed. Method: Sample taken 115 women aged 22-89 years with cervical carcinoma in advanced stages (IIA IB2-VAT) being 51 % FIGO stage IIB. The immunohistochemical expression of VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1 parameters could be performed in 111 patients assessing their cytoplasmic expression (VEGF) and nuclear (HIF-1\u03b1), classifying them as negative (less than 10 % positive cells), weak expression (<25 %), moderate (26-50 %) and diffuse (>50 %). Results: VEGF expression was positive in 90.4 % with a slight predominance of diffuse expression (33 %). However HIF-1 was positive in 45 % and mostly with weak expression. Conclusion: VEGF and HIF-1 are biomarkers related to angiogenesis and neovascularization and there are targeted therapies against them. Routine antibodies performed in tissues pretreatment provides pathways for response, survival and prognosis of patients with expression of these markers.

Cherstvy * Belarusian State Medical University, Dept. of Pathology, Minsk, Belarus Objective: To determine the features of the aromatase cytochrome P-450 (ACP-450) expression in ectopic endometrium during active and inactive adenomyosis. Method: Biopsy material of 33 women with active (n = 22; average age 48,8 \u00b1 1,02 years) and inactive adenomyosis (n = 15, average age 49,3 \u00b1 0,85 years). IHC studies were conducted with the use of antibodies to ACP-450 (Abcam, 1: 200). Number of positive cells was counted in 5 fields of view at 400x magnification using Aperio ImageScope program. The program \u00abStatistica 10.0\u00bb (U-test by Manny Whitman) was used for statistical processing of the results. Results: The ACP-450 expression was revealed in the cytoplasm of epithelial glands of ectopic endometrium, cytogenetic stroma, in vascular endothelium, in the cytoplasm of myocytes. The expression level of ACP-450 is higher in active foci than inactive foci of adenomyosis (p < 0,05: positivity p = 0.000). During ROC-analysis excellent quality of the model was confirmed: the area under the ROC-curve was 0.9. The cut-off point between the groups-0.372, specificity of the method-80 %, sensitivity-75 %. Conclusion: High level of the ACP-450 expression in active foci of adenomyosis ensures their growth through local hyperestrogenimia.

LOX was associated with IT and PT. LOXL-3 was associated with ER, PR, and molecular subtype. LOXL-1 and -2 show no correlation with clinicopathologic parameters. Conclusion: FF and LOXs were associated with inflammation in breast cancer. However, there was no association between FF and LOXs. FF was associated with poor prognostic markers of breast cancer. Our results suggest that LOXs may contribute to the formation of a FF indirectly by inflammation in breast cancer.Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic utility of cell block preparations in FNAC of palpable breast lesions among female patients in Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria. Method: Cell blocks were prepared using 10 % neutral buffered formalin from the residual breast aspirates of 100 consecutive female patients attending the FNAC clinic of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. The slides of the conventional smears, cell block preparations and excisional biopsies were examined and results were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 20 (SPSS20). Results: Cell block preparations had lesser equivocal cases. In all, a definitive diagnosis was achieved in 76 % of cases on conventional smears and 84 % of cases on cell blocks. Of the 100 patients that had FNAC, 44 (44 %) had excisional biopsy performed. All cases that were benign on cell block were confirmed to be benign on histology as compared to 95.2 % of cases on conventional smears. There is increased cellularity and additional yield of 13 % for malignancy on cell block, with the preservation of cellular architecture pattern even with excessive blood. Cell block preparations enhanced the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of breast FNAC from 76.5 to 100 %, 91.7 to 100 %, 86.7 to 100 % and 91.6 to 100 % respectively. Conclusion: Cell block preparations remarkably improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast FNAC. We recommend that cell block techniques be incorporated in routine breast cytology examinations.",

Results: APC mutation (codon-935) was detected at 16 years of age. In the same year, a thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma (pT1) was performed. Seven years later, a prophylactic total colectomy revealed more than 100 adenomas. At the age of 30 years she performed breast silicone implantation and, 1 year after, breast bilateral tumours were diagnosed in core biopsy as fibromatosis (nuclear \u03b2-catenin+, estrogen receptors-). Bilateral mastectomy was performed and fibromatosis relapsed in the right thoracic wall 1 year later. Conclusion: This rare case illustrates a bilateral relapsed breast fibromatosis, very likely related to surgery and continuous implant trauma, in a FAP context. The increased risk of developing fibromatosis in patients with FAP should be considered in the decision to place breast implants. Surrogate molecular subtyping correlates with response to neoadjuvancy, with less frequent CPR in luminal cancers, being useful as a predictive parameter and it is readily available in most institutions. the pCR group compared to the pPR group. The NHEJ and NER pathways of DNA repair showed the most significant relevance. Expression profile of DNA repair genes associated with pCR was different in the node-positive and node-negative subgroups. PARP1 and PARP3 were upregulated in the node-positive subgroup with pPR. Conclusion: Although BRCA1 germline mutations are the principal defects in BRCA1-associated TNBC, our results indicate that the additional downregulation of other genes engaged in major pathways of DNA repair may play a decisive role in the pathological response to cisplatin neo-chemotherapy. The results suggest that patients with node-positive BRCA1associated TNBCs that do not exhibit pCR after cisplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be candidates for subsequent therapy with PARP inhibitors.",

Here, we compared the accuracy of dual SISH to FISH in HER2 (2+) breast carcinoma and evaluated the feasibility of dual SISH method in routine practice. Method: Sixty HER2 (2+) consecutive tumour samples diagnosed between January 2009 and February 2013 were selected. Demographic, histological and immunohistochemical features and FISH results were recruited from patient records and compared to dual SISH results. Our results are consistent with previously reported literature, indicating SISH can be used to determine HER2 status. However, preanalytical problems may cause inadequate or uncountable signals, making interpretation impossible for the pathologist and highlighting the importance of standardization and quality control programs. The results of our study pursuit us to suppose that there is an inverse correlation between Her2/neu amplification and polysomy of the chromosome 17 with low level expression of progesterone receptors. These patients still show high level of estrogen receptors. Further study of the connetion between progesterone receptor and Her2/neu may lead to important correlations in the treatment of patients with breast carcinoma. Nuclear reactivity within the tumour cells was considered as positive result. Correlation of EBER-ISH positivity with clinicopathological features was performed using Fisher exact test and p value <0.05 was considered as significant. Conclusion: A possible causal association of EBV in BC cases in Indian patients is suggested by high frequency of EBER-ISH positivity noted in our study. This might have therapeutic significance because of the possible role of EBV specific cytotoxic T cells in targeting EBV associated tumour cells and can be considered as a potential targeted therapy.",

Immune cell densities were quantified as cell/mm2 using the CAP guidelines. Correlation of immune cell densities with tumour sub-types was undertaken using paired t-test, ANOVA and Chi square. Results: A total of 27(25 %) patients had TNBC and 77(74 %) were non-TNBC patients. Patients with TNBC showed significantly increased infiltration of lymphocytes (T and B cells) compared to the patients with non-TNBC, while myelocytic infiltration was not significantly different. Within the TNBC group, infiltration of T-lymphocytes was significantly higher compared to B-lymphocytes. However, CD4 and CD8 infiltration was not significantly different within the TNBC group. Conclusion: Patients with TNBC show increased lymphocytic (both T and B lymphocytes) infiltration compared to the patients with non-TNBC. Moreover, TNBC are heavily infiltrated with T lymphocytes compared to the B lymphocytes. This suggests higher immunogenicity of TNBCs and may indicate a higher responsiveness of these cancers to immunotherapy. axillary lymph nodes excised were positive for malignancy.

We also found statistically significant correlation between Vav2 expression and ER/PR positivity. ER-positive carcinomas which are mostly well differentiated and have more indolent disease course, showed significantly higher Vav2 expression. Our findings suggest that Vav2 might play a relevant role in the invasive tumour progression, warranting further investigations. The mean age at diagnosis was 60 years. All patients presented with a palpable mass. They all underwent surgery and only four of them had neoadjuvant-chemotherapy. Twenty-seven patients had mastectomy and eight had lympectomy. Twenty-eight patients underwent axillary dissection. Macroscopic examination revealed a cystic cavity with endoluminal papillary lesion in two cases and a firm nodule measuring from 1.5 to 9 cm in 31 cases. Histopathology found invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) in 27 cases while the other cases were: two intacystic papillary carcinomas with invasion, two micro-invasive carcinomas, one invasive lobular carcinoma, one mixed invasive NST and lobular carcinoma with melanotic features, one mucinous carcinoma and one neuroendocrine carcinoma.

Results of touch imprint cytology were compared with permanent histology sections.Objective: Development of breast carcinoma is regulated by many factors. CAV1 is a protein that humans is encoded by CAV1 gene. The scaffolding protein encoded by this gene is the main component of the caveolae plasma membranes found in most cell type. Recent studies have shown the loss of stromal CAV1 expression in breast carcinomas may have a prognostic importance. In our study, we purposed to evaluate the interactions between stromal CAV1 loss and its association with different pathological and clinical parameters status in breast carcinomas. Identification of specific biomarkers is very important for prediction of clinical outcome in breast tumours. We demonstrated loss of stroma CAV1 expression in breast cancer correlate with tumour size, HER2 amplification, stage and lenf node involvement. These results suggest that CAV1 may play a role in the biology of breast cancers.",

Method: We reviewed the histologic slides, patients' clinical data and pertinent articles indexed in PubMed. Patient 2 is alive with no signs of recurrence after 90 months of follow-up. No microsattelite instability (MSI) was found in the tumour. Conclusion: Our cases support that BSC has a distinct morphology, variable immunoprofile and may behave aggressively, although it is unknown if it differs from other high grade carcinomas. MSI is not characteristic of BSC, contrasting with cutaneous counterpart. The diagnosis of cardiac tumour was made by echocardiography (in 14 cases), transthoracic and/or transoesophageal, and in intraoperative consultation (1 case). The definitive diagnosis was made in histopathological sections. Treatment was surgical removal of the tumour mass, with valve replacement in 5 cases.Conclusion: The analysis realized in our Institution verified the rarity of this diagnosis. Although PFE is a benign tumour, its high embolic potential can cause life-threatening complications, so early diagnosis is important because surgical removal is curative.Results: The AS group displayed significantly less SOS values compared to the AR group with an exception of calcified areas. The AS group showed significantly decreased SOS values following protease digestion, whereas the AR showed little reduction. The AS group presented type III collagen in the fibrosa and the ventricularis. In the AR group, both type I and III collagens coexisted at the fibrosa and ventricularis. By advanced glycation end-products staining, the AS group showed sparse, weak staining, whereas the AR group presented a strong positive reaction on the fibrosa. By lysyl oxidase staining the AS group showed scattered positive staining on the fibroblasts, while the AR group displayed negative staining. Conclusion: AS displayed tissue remodeling with destruction and repair, while AR showed static chemical alterations with slow turnover of collagen. The number of microvessels was not associated with severity of stenosis, intraplaque hemorrhage, or necrotic core size. Conclusion: Intraplaque hemorrhage was common in any types of coronary culprits; however, not all coronary culprits were associated with increased intraplaque microvessels.",

Pappa * , A. Dimitriadi, A. Linardou, B. M. Michaelides, G. Panselinas, Z. Pappas, G. Kakiopoulos, T. Choreftaki General Hospital of Athens, Dept. of Surgical Pathology, GreeceObjective: Warthin tumour is the second most common salivary gland tumour. Rarely, either the epithelial or lymphoid component of Warthin tumour can undergo malignant transformation, with an estimated incidence of less than 1 %. Several malignancies have been described in literature, but only few of Merkel cell. We report a case of a 69-yearold man presenting with distention of his left parotid gland. Parotidectomy was performed. Method: We received the left parotid gland measuring 6.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 2.7 cm. The cut surfaces revealed a well-circumscribed, grayish, solid, partly cystic tumour measuring 2.8 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2cm. Results: Microscopically we observed a malignant tumour arising in a Warthin tumour, comprising of solid sheets of small to medium size cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval nuclei, dusty chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Numerous mitoses and necrosis were seen. Immunohistochemically, a paranuclear \"dot-like\" positivity pattern for CKAE1/AE3, CK20 and Neurofilaments was observed. The cells stained also positive for CD-56 and Synaptophysin. Ki-67 was estimated 50-55 %. A diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma was made.

Our aim is to determine the immunoprofiles of the various biomarkers and their clinicopathological significance in SDC. Method: 152 cases of SDC were immunostained for HER2, HER3, EGFR, p53, AR, ER\u03b2, CK5/6, MUC1, PLAG1 and Ki-67. Also HER2 gene amplification were examined by FISH. Results: Immunoreactivity for each biomarker in SDCs was as follows: Interestingly, overexpression of HER2, HER3, EGFR and Ki-67 was significantly associated with SDCs ex pleomorphic adenoma rather than that in de novo SDCs. Both overall survival and progression-free survival of the patients with higher Ki-67 LI were significantly shorter than those of patients with lower Ki-67 LI. Moreover, both AR-negative and CK5/6-positive groups showed significantly shorter progression-free survival. There was no significant correlation between the other biomarkers analyzed and clinicopathologic parameters.Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that Ki-67, AR and CK5/6 are regarded as a prognostic factor in SDC. Diverse molecular mechanisms might play in the carcinogenesis of SDCs depending on their origin. \u00d6zg\u00fcl * , F. Canaz, M. Acikalin, E. Yilmaz, O. Pinarbasli, S.

Method: Retrospective review was performed of patients with adenocarcinoma of the sinonasal tract from 1996 to 2016. Demographic data, disease presentation, treatment, and survival rates were collected and evaluated. Results: 40 patients with sinonasal adenocarcinoma were identified. Twenty-five percent of the patients had wood-related occupations, 15 % working on the cork industry. Average age at time of diagnosis was 67 years (48-84 years). Fifty-eight percent of patients presented with T3 or T4 tumours. Surgery plus adjuvant radiation therapy was the most common primary form of treatment (58 %). 36 had the intestinal type and 4 had non-intestinal type histologies. Persistence of disease or local recurrence was seen in 26 patients (65 %). The overall 5-year survival was 59 %. Survival was decreased significantly in patients with T3 or T4 tumours and with disease's persistence after initial therapy. Conclusion: Sinonasal adenocarcinomas are locally aggressive tumours that usually present at high stages. Association with occupational exposure, namely with the local cork industry, was present.

Here, we report 3 new cases in order to illustrate clinical, morphological and histopathological features of these rare entities. Method: Our present study concerned 3 cases of fat containing thyroid lesions diagnosed as such in the department of pathology of Sfax Hospital. Results: The mean age of patients was 60 years with 2 females and one man. All patients presented multinodular goiter in physical examination and underwent total thyro\u00efdectomy. The thyro\u00efd specimens showed either yellow-tan nodules (2 cases) or diffuse yellow-brown appearance (2 cases). Histologic examination revealed 3 different patterns: (1) a well circumscribed fat nodule (thyrolipoma) in one case; (2) a diffuse fat infiltration (thyrolipomatosis) in one case; or (3) fat infiltration involving both patterns in one case. Moreover, a papillary carcinoma and a lymphocytic thyro\u00efditis were identified in one case of thyrolipomatosis. Conclusion: In summury, we reported 3 cases of thyrolipoma and thyrolipomatosis. Only one case have combined histological pattern with concomitant papillary carcinoma, which is an extremely rare feature in the literature.PS-12-033Histopathological differences between primary Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome and Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome accompanied by scleroderma U.

J\u00e1come Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o do Instituto Portugu\u00eas de Oncologia, Dept. de Patologica, Porto, PortugalObjective: There have been significant progress in our understanding of salivary gland tumours (SGT), with description of chromosomal translocations, that are useful for diagnosis, working as confirmatory test. CRTC1-MAML2 in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) correlates with better prognostic. EWSR1-ATF1 gene fusion is specifically found in hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma(HCCC). Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) was recently described and associated with ETV6-NTRK3 translocation. We aim to report three illustrative cases of SGT: Case 1(MASC)-23-year old female with a mass in the submandibular gland; Case 2(HCCC)-51year old female with a palatal mass with local recurrence after 10 years; Case 3(MEC)-51-year old female with a lesion of the tongue. Method: Clinicopathological information was collected from clinical files and pathology reports. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were used for molecular analyses using FISH.Results: Case1: Microcystic architecture and eosinophilic homogenous bubbly secretion. Immunoprofile: S-100 protein+, DOG-1-. Case2: Admixture of clear and eosinophilic cells, embedded in hyalinized stroma. Immunoprofile: Cytokeratin+, p63+, myoepithelial markers-. Case3: Squamous, intermediate, and goblet cells with mucus production. Conclusion: Molecular pathology offers new insights in terms of pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis that would help to improve the management of patients with SGT, adding value at a therapeutic level, particularly through the search of new biomarkers that could act as potential therapeutic targets. PS-12-036 Chordomas of the head and neck region B. Hayit * , D. Arik, E. Yilmaz, M. Acikalin, O.

They show a dual epithelial-mesenchymal differentiation and account for 1-4 % of all bone malignancies. Chordomas preferentially occur in the sacrum (50-60 %). The head and neck localisation is not common. Here we report chordomas of spheno-occipital, and cervical region diagnosed in our department and summarize clinicopathological characteristics of these cases. Method: Retrospectively, the cases diagnosed as \"chordoma\" were reviewed from 2002 to 2015. Clinicopathological features of cases with a tumour at spheno-occipital, and cervical region were assessed. Results: Of 7 cases (4 males, 3 females) with a mean age of 48.4 (13-75 years). Six cases were diagnosed as conventional chordoma and one was chondroid chordoma. Mean follow-up was 34.5 months (10-110 months). Recurrence was detected in 2 cases and distant metastasis was determined in one case. Conclusion: Chordomas resist chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Radical surgery and high-dose radiation are the most used treatments. Given the location and invasive nature of these tumours, complete resection is difficult.PS-12-037 Granular cell tumour: Report of seven cases I. Provatas * , C. Kouvidou, G. Kyriakopoulos, K.

Method: We reviewed the clinical chart and pathological report of a POM patient treated at Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Results: A 27-year-old African woman presented with a painless maxillary mass developing a few months ago. She denied previous trauma and any medical history. An excisional biopsy under local anaesthesia was performed. The histologic findings demonstrated a lobulated tumour mass composed of haphazardly arranged stellate and spindle-shaped cells in the myxoid stroma interspersed with variable amounts of collagen fibres. Islands of odontogenic epithelium were also presented. The diagnosis of POM was established. Conclusion: There have been limited numbers of POM reported in the literature. It is hypothesised that this tumour derives from an abnormal development of the pulpal organ or supportive structures of the teeth. Because of its rarity, there is no universally accepted treatment for POM. Its therapies vary from enucleation and curettage with/without peripheral ostectomy, to radical jaw resection with tumour free margin of 1.5-2 cm and removal of neighbouring teeth.

Zagalo, A. F\u00e9lix * IPO Lisboa FG, Servi\u00e7o de Anatomia Patol\u00f3gica, PortugalObjective: NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is a recently described entity with a predilection for young individuals and a poor prognosis. It is characterized by chromosomal translocation of the NUT gene. It usually involves midline structures with a minority of cases presenting outside of the midline axis. We describe an exceptional case of a NMC arising in the parotid gland. Method: A 34-year-old male presented with a rapidly growing left cervical mass. MRI revealed an isolated lesion of the left parotid gland measuring 30 \u00d7 21 mm. Parotidectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. Results: Gross examination revealed a 35 mm white solid infiltrating parotid tumour with invasion of the surrounding soft tissue, adjacent to the surgical margin. Histology showed a poorly-differentiated carcinoma with nests of undifferentiated cells merging with foci of necrosis and occasional abrupt foci of well-differentiated squamous epithelium with keratinization. In the context of a primary parotid carcinoma with squamous differentiation in a young patient, t(15;19) was determined by FISH. A diagnosis of NMC without metastases was rendered. Currently (4 months), the patient is undergoing adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of considering NMC in the differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinomas of the head and neck region in young adults, even outside of the midline structures.PS-12-043Dentin dysplasia type 1 in an orthognathic patient: A case report and literature review P.

Laga * CHUK, Dept. of Anatomic Pathology, Kigali, RwandaObjective: Rhinosporidiosis is a tropical disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi. Originally described by Seeber in Argentina, the disease is primarily observed in India and Sri Lanka. There is only one brief report documenting the disease in humans previously inRwanda (1993). The Anatomic Pathology Laboratory at the \"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK), a teaching hospital in Rwanda, started operating in October of 2013. We report four cases of rhinosporidiosis confirmed by histopathology. Method: We conducted a retrospective search for cases of Rhinosporidiosis in the anatomic pathology files of CHUK from 2013 to 2016. Slides were retrieved and the diagnosis was confirmed for all cases. PAS-D and MSS stains were performed in one case. Results: Four cases of Rhinosporidiosis were identified. Two cases were diagnosed in 2014, one in 2015, and one in 2016. All four patients were males. Their ages were 7, 12, 13 and 15. All presented with a history of nasal obstruction and had a nasal mass on exam. Of interest, three patients are from the same district (Gatsibo, Eastern Province) in Rwanda. Conclusion: We document four cases of Rhinosporidiosis from the Eastern Province, Rwanda; three within the same district.

Method: A 56-year-old man, with no medical history, presented with epistaxis.Results: On otolaryngological examination, a polypoid mass of nasal cavity measuring 1 cm. The craniofacial CT scan showed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass originating from the left maxillary sinus, without bone involvement. The detailed metastatic work-up was negative. The endoscopic biopsy resection revealed small round cell tumour expressing diffusely CD99. The neuroendocrine, lymphoid and epithelial markers were negative. A EWS gene rearrangement was demonstrated by FISH molecular analysis. The patient underwent several cycles of neoadjuvent chemotherapy and he was still under follow-up without features of recurrent disease for 15 months. Conclusion: PNET is rarely encountered in sinonasal region. It is exceptional in middle-aged adults. We tend to show that despite the aggressive character of PNET, an early diagnosis at a localized stage can improve the outcome.Gazi Univer. Fac. of Dentistry, Oral Pathology, Ankara, Turkey",

There were 16 males and 6 females and their ages varied from 51 to 80 years with a median age of 51 years. Nasopharynx is the most common location (13 cases). In 18 cases lymphomas were of B-cell phenotype (8 cases diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 8 small cell lymphoma, 1 plasmablastic lymphoma and 1 Burkitt lymphoma). They were of T-cell phenotype in 3 cases (1 case LT NOS, 1 case NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type, 1 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 1). Hodgkin lymphoma was diagnosed in 1 case.Conclusion: The present study shows that the most common location of Lymphomas of WR is the nasopharynx. Median age in our series was 51 years, most lower than that reported in the literature. Our study shows a predominance of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma sub type as shown in in the literature.PS-12-057 Papillary carcinoma arising in a thyroglossal duct cyst: A case report A.-M. Teodora Domsa * , A. R. Trif, M. Muresan, D. Crisan Cluj-Napoca, RomaniaObjective: The thyroglossal duct cyst (TGDC) is the most common congenital abnormality of the thyroid gland development. It is estimated that it occurs in 7 % of the adult population. However, the highest incidence of thyroglossal duct cyst is encountered among children and adolescents. Only 1 % of TGDC develop carcinomas: 90 % of all carcinomas are papillary thyroid, 5 % squamous cell carcinomas, 2-3 % follicular carcinomas; anaplastic carcinomas are rare and medullary carcinomas have never been described. TGDC carcinomas are more frequent in women, with a sex distribution of 1,5:1 up to 2:1. Method: We present the case of a 25 year old woman with a pre-laryngeal mass, unrelated to the thyroid. Clinically and imagistically, the thyroid gland was unmodified and no enlarged lymph nodes were identified. The mass was excised using the Sistrunk procedure. Results: Paraffin embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically, revealing a TGDC component with a papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from it, confirmed by immunostaining for cytokeratin 19. Conclusion: Because total thyroidectomy was not performed in this case, the dilemma of differentiating between primary TGDC papillary carcinoma and metastatic thyroid papillary carcinoma remains unsolved, so longterm monitoring of the thyroid gland is needed.PS-12-059 Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma of the parotid gland: A case report K. Horvat Pavlov * , L. Manojlovic, M. Meter, S. Ga\u0161parov, S. Manojlovic Clinical Hospital Merkur, Pathology, Zagreb, CroatiaObjective: Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA), the most common malignant neoplasm of minor salivary glands, occurs very rarely in major salivary glands, most frequently in parotid gland. Less than 40 cases have been reported to date. Its morphological diversity and exceptional occurrence in major salivary glands make diagnosis difficult. Method: 52-year-old woman presented with retroauricular oval nodule, present for several years, increasing in size recently. Surgically excised specimen was a circumscribed, partly incapsulated nodule measuring 2,5 cm. Microscopically tumour was composed of monomorphic, cuboidal cells with vesicular nuclei and lightly eosinophilic, focally clear cytoplasms, forming lobular, tubular, trabecular and solid patterns with scant eosinophilic, somewhere myxoid stroma. Tumour focally infiltrated adjacent adipose tissue. Strong immunoreactivity for CK7, Vimentin, S-100, and moderate GFAP positivity was observed. Proliferative index Ki67 was low. Results: Defining characteristics of PLGA are cellular uniformity and great histologic variability. PLGA may occur either de novo or develop in a pre-existent pleomorphic adenoma. Only 8 cases of de novo PLGA originating in major salivary glands were reported. Pleomorphic adenoma presents the main differential diagnostic dilemma. PLGAs uniformly express CK7, S100 and vimentin positivity and GFAP is usually negative, although some authors reported positive staining in up to 15 % of PLGAs. Pleomorphic adenomas reveal strong positivity for GFAP. Conclusion: GFAP positivity in major salivary gland PLGA may suggest a malignancy arising in pre-existent pleomorphic adenoma.PS-12-060Dedifferentiated epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of the parapharyngeal area: Case report E. Yilmaz Ak\u00e7ay * , T. Canpolat, A. N. Erkan, P. B\u00f6rcek, O. Gunhan Baskent University, Pathology, Ankara, TurkeyObjective: Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) is a rare low-grade salivary gland malignancy of presumed intercalated duct origin comprising 1 % of all salivary gland tumours. High grade transformation in EMC is a recently recognised entity with few cases reported in the literature. Abrupt transition of the myoepithelial and/or ductal component of EMC into high grade carcinoma is referred to as \"dedifferentiated EMC\". The most common site of involvement was the parotid gland, followed by the submandibular gland, the palate and nasal cavity. Method: An additional case of dedifferentiated EMC in the parapharyngeal area. The patient was a 65-year-old man presented with a rapid growth of a mass in the left submandibular area which he had first noticed 4 years ago. CT imaging demonstrated a 41 \u00d7 30 mm, central necrotic lesion extending from nasopharynx to parapharyngeal area Histologically, most parts of the lesion were high-grade carcinoma with sheetlike and nestlike growth of markedly atypical cells and comedonecrosis, whereas the minor part consisted of typical EMC. Results: We report this case with histological and immunohistochemical analyses and review of the literature. Conclusion: The aggressive behaviour of dedifferentiated EMC suggests that it is important to recognise this variant of EMC to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.PS-12-061Sporadic endolymphatic sac tumour: Case report and review of the literature E.

Results: Cells of SCN may express markers of stem cells (Oct.-4, CD 117, CD34), mesenchymal (SMA, Desmin, Vimentin) and epithelial (CK, EMA) differentiation, play central role in the pathological remodeling and mesenchimal-epithelial transdifferentiation in lungs. Conclusion: Remodeling of lung tissue in SCN is the key process in structural rearrangements in IIP. Persistent and severe damage of SCN leads to the development of fibrosis and adenomatous hyperplasia and lung cancer. PS-13-004 The role of TRAP1 in the assessment of invasion in lung adenocarcinoma with lepidic pattern M.-S. Roh * , H.-J. Koh * Dong-A University, Dept. of Pathology, Busan, Republic of KoreaObjective: The extent of invasive component in lung adenocarcinomas is associated with clinical outcomes. However, determination of invasion is the most difficult issue in practical pathologic diagnosis. The TNF receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), an important member of mitochondrial heat shock protein 90 family, is involved in neoplastic progression because of its ability to suppress cell death and reorganize cellular metabolic pathways. Method: We performed immunohistochemical detection of TRAP1 in 57 small (\u22643 cm) resected lung adenocarcinomas with lepidic pattern [11 adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), 24 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and 22 invasive lepidic adenocarcinoma (ILA)] to evaluate relationship between expression of TRAP1 and invasion. Results: No TRAP1 expression was seen in non-neoplastic alveolar parenchyma. MIA (17 of 24, 70.8 %) and ILA (17 of 22, 77.3 %) more frequently showed expression of TRAP1 than in AIS (4 of 11, 36.4 %). Although the frequency of TRAP1 expression between MIA and ILA did not reach statistical significance, ILA frequently showed high (strong staining in \u226550 % of tumour cells) expression of TRAP1. Conclusion: The expression of TRAP1 may contribute to local tumour invasion and TRAP1 can be a potentially useful marker for assessment of invasion in lung adenocarcinoma with lepidic pattern.PS-13-005Four-year audit on molecular testing in metastatic lung cancer on small biopsy/cytology samples in an Irish rapid access lung cancer centre A. Fabre * , T. Brady, J. Murphy, D. Timlin, E. Hanrahan, C. O'Brien, S. Finn * St. Vincents University Hospital, Dept. of Histopathology, Dublin, IrelandObjective: To assess the frequency of EGFR mutations and ALK fusion over a 4 year period and in advanced stage non small cell lung carcinoma. Method: Molecular data from the laboratory files were recorded to include sex, age, type of sample (cytology/histology, biopsy vs. surgical) on which molecular testing was performed (RT-PCR and FISH), type of mutations, histological subtypes, and failure rates.Tuesday, 27 September 2016, 09.30-10.30, Hall 11.3 PS-13 Pulmonary PathologyResults: 301 cases were collected, and in 87 %, the sample type tested was non surgical (biopsy/cytology) . Women represented 53 % of the cohort, 30 % of the testing was done on cytological samples, of which 65 % were EBUS samples. Thirty-one percent of testing was done on lung CT guided core biopsy samples. Adenocarcinoma represented 88 % of the tumour subtypes. Regarding EGFR, 13 % of patients were found to harbour mutations with 71 % of these being women. Exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutation were the most common (51 and 23 %). ALK rearrangement was detected in 3 % of cases, 56 % were women. TTF-1 was expressed by tumour cells in 87 % of EGFR mutated adenocarcinomas and 83.3 % of ALK rearranged adenocarcinomas. In this cohort with a predominance of small samples, failure rate for EGFR testing reached 9 and 15.6 % for ALK FISH testing. Conclusion: This audit from a single institution with a rapid lung cancer assessment clinic and formal MDT appraisal of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer, provides similar rates of EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement to that published in non -Asian populations, in a cohort where 87 % of molecular tests were done on biopsy/cytology samples, further emphasizing the feasibility of these techniques on small samples Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte, Dept. of Pathology, Lisbon, PortugalObjective: Placental transmogrification of the lung is an unusual histopathologic pattern first described by McChesney in 1979, characterized by formation of placental villus-like structures in the lung parenchyma. This condition has been described in patients with bullous emphysema and fibrochondromatous hamartomas. The aim of this work is evaluate the prevalence of this rare feature in this type of pathology. Method: A total of 103 pulmonary hamartomas and 410 bullous emphysema diagnosed in the Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte (Lisbon) during16 years (2000-2015)  were retrieved. Histologic slides of all these cases were reviewed for the presence of villus-like papillary projections and/or placenta-like structures. Results: Placental transmogrification was identified in 3 of 513 cases (0.58 %) of pulmonary resections; 1 case with clinical information of hamartoma and 2 of emphysema. Histologically showed multiple villous structures resembling placental chorionic villi. Conclusion: Placental transmogrification is regarded as an unusual benign lesion curable by surgical resection. The origin and pathogenesis are still unknown; some authors have hypothesized that this condition is likely a congenital malformation; others believe that a proliferating respiratory epithelium exceeding the stromal component may induce placental papillary projections. In our opinion probably results from the development of oedema, fibrosis, and chronic inflammation in the residual alveolar tissues.PS-13-008 Experience in determine ROS 1 with immunohistochemistry and FISH in primary lung adenocarcinoma in the 12 de Octubre hospital from 2013 to 2016 (Madrid, Spain) G. T. V\u00e1zquez Ben\u00edtez * , A. B. Enguita Valls * Hospital 12 de Octubre, Dept. of Pathology, Madrid, Spain Objective: Determine the number of patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma and translocation of ROS-1 gene with immunohistochemistry and FISH, to compare results of both techniques in a period from January 2013 to March 2016 in the 12 de octubre hospital. Method: In a retrospective observational study, we identified 436 patients diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma in the 12 Octubre hospital from January 2013 to March 2016. All patients were performed determination of biomarkers, including ROS-1.Results: 436 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, 62 % were males and 38 % female, with an average age of 74 years. 1.1 % of the cases had ROS-1 gene translocation, and the average age was 53 years (60 % were men). 80 % of cases were positive also with immunohistochemistry. There was only one case with ROS-1 positivity by immunohistochemistry and had no gene amplification by FISH. Conclusion: The incidence of translocation of the ROS1 gene in our study population was 1.1 %. Comparing the two techniques, we observed a high correlation between positive cases. Our results are similar with the published literature that estimate the incidence of ROS-1 in 1 % of patients and could be benefited with anti-tyrosine kinase treatment.PS-13-009 Fluorescent in SITU hybridization analysis of the ALK gene in 2045 non-small cell lung cancer patients from Northwest Spain (Galicia) I.

S\u00e1nchez Ares * Universitary Clinical Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Santiago de Compostela, Spain Objective: Description of our experience as a referral center in the public health care system of Galicia, in Northwest Spain, for the identification by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) rearrangements in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; and the correlation between ALK patterns and clinicopathologic features. Method: 2045 samples of NSCLC patients were collected from 2010 to 2015 and tested by FISH. We examined 1686 paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and 395 cytological samples (306 cell block preparations and 53 cytological smears), and investigated any correlation between the FISH results and the clinicopathological features. Results: Tissue samples showed a higher rate of successful evaluation %) in cytological smears. This translocation was associated with a non-smoker history, younger age, female gender, stage IV, and an adenocarcinoma histological type. Conclusion: ALK evaluation by FISH is feasible in both tissue and cytological samples. Clinicopathological features of our ALK positive patient series are similar to those previously reported in the literature. PS-13-011 Microvascular proliferation is associated with aggressive tumour features and reduced survival in lung adenocarcinomas M. Ramnefjell * , C. Aamelfot, L. Helgeland, L. Akslen Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Dept. of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, NorwayObjective: Despite new treatment options in lung cancer, there is still need for new and better prognostic factors to assist in treatment decisions. Angiogenesis has been associated with tumour growth and dissemination, and our research group has found that vascular proliferation index (VPI) is a valuable prognostic marker. Here, we studied the prevalence and prognostic impact of VPI on cancer specific survival (LCSS) in lung adenocarcinomas (AC). Method: Selected tumour slides from a cohort of 210 patients surgically treated for AC at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway, during 1993-2010, were stained for Nestin/Ki-67 (dilutions 1:50/ 1:100). VPI was evaluated as the ratio between proliferating vessels (pMVD) and the microvessel density (MVD). Cut-off value was set at 1.9 % (median). Angiogenesis by VPI can be evaluated by Nestin/Ki-67. High VPI is associated with aggressive tumour features such as tumour grade and stage, and also reduced LCSS, in lung AC. VPI could be a marker for prognosis and should be studied in other cohorts. Ishibashi-Ueda * , M. Nishihira, Y. Ikeda, K. Ohta-Ogo, M. Matsumoto, J. Nakashima, T. Matsuyama, N. Ueda National Cerebrovascular Center, Dept. of Pathology, Suita, JapanObjective: Pulmonary intimal sarcoma (PIS) is a rare tumour and difficult to diagnose because its clinical features often mimic chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). We report a recurrent CTEPH case of 65-year-old man to clarify the cause of recurrence of CTEPH by histology. Method: The excised specimens of the first and the second pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) were compared histopathologically and immunohistochemically. Results: The excised specimen of the first PEA composed of organized and hyalinized thrombus without cellular component. The patient showed a good outcome for 5 years after PEA. However, because of recurrence of pulmonary hypertension, re-PEA was performed. The obtained specimen of the second PEA showed undifferentiated intimal sarcoma in peripheral pulmonary artery with gelatinous appearance macroscopically. The histology of the gelatinous part showed spindle-shaped sarcoma cells scattered in myxomatous extracellular matrix. The proximal part of the specimen composed of non-specific hyalinized material like thrombus which was the same appearance of the first PEA specimen. The patient had no underlying disease such as coagulation abnormality, deep venous thrombosis, or any other primary malignant disease. He died after the second PEA for 6 months, although adjuvant chemotherapy was done. Conclusion: After 5 years of initial operation of PEA, CTEPH re-occurred. The cause of this case of CTEPH finally revealed intimal sarcoma of pulmonary artery. PIS is a rare disease. The histological feature of extracellular matrix of PIS was very similar to organized thrombus of CTEPH. The behavior of PIS occasionally mimics CTEPH because PIS is sometimes slow growing accompanying with rich extracellular matrix like thrombus.PS-13-013Histological conformity of primary lung carcinoma type in biopsy and operation material A. Jukna * , I. Strumfa, A. Vanags, J. GardovskisRiga Stradins University, Dept. of Pathology, LatviaObjective: To compare the histological diagnosis of lung carcinoma in biopsy and operation material in order to detect the frequency of morphological conformity. Method: The retrospective study included 59 consecutive patients who underwent both pulmonary biopsy and resection due to primary lung carcinoma. The histological tumour type was assessed in haematoxylineosin (HE) stained slides. Immunohistochemistry was performed upon necessity. Lung tumour classification by World Health Organization, 2015 was applied. Descriptive statistics was performed including detection of 95 % confidence interval (CI). Results: The study group comprised 59 cases of which 44 (74.6 %; CI = 62.2-83.9) showed morphological conformity of diagnosis in biopsy and operation material by HE. These cases comprised squamous ). Fifteen tumours (25.4 %; CI = 16.1-37.8) were diagnosed as non-small cell carcinomas by HE in the biopsy. Among these, 11 cancers (18.6 %; CI = 10.7-30.4) were attributed to specific histological subtypes after evaluation of surgical material or by immunohistochemistry but 4 cases (6.8 %; CI = 2.7-16.2) remained as large cell carcinomas.Conclusion: Three fourths of primary lung carcinoma can be reliably diagnosed by HE in biopsy. The remaining cases necessitate investigation of operation material (if available) and immunohistochemistry. Habougit * , P. Dal-Col, M. Mobarki, O. Tiffet, B. Trombert Paviot, J. M. Vergnon, P.

            "text": "Objective: BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumour suppressor involved in regulation of the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, repair of DNA damage and apoptosis. Loss of BAP1 protein expression in mesothelial proliferations has so far been shown to be 100 % specific for malignant mesothelioma. However, few studies have investigated the rate BAP1 loss in pleural metastasis of other malignancies. Our objective is to determine the rate of BAP1 loss in lung adenocarcinoma. Method: Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 was performed on sections from a tissue microarray containing 80 confirmed cases of lung adenocarcinoma. The cases were interpreted as showing BAP1 loss if nuclear staining was completely absent in all tumour cells and present in lung stromal and inflammatory cells serving as internal controls. Cases showing BAP1 loss in the internal controls were excluded. Results: After exclusion of 11 cases, 1 out of 69 cases of lung adenocarcinoma (1.4 % of cases) showed BAP1 loss. The remaining 68 cases showed preserved nuclear expression of BAP1 in both the lung adenocarcinoma and internal controls. Conclusion: Loss of BAP1 expression is a rare event in lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, BAP1 is a potentially useful addition to the immunohistochemical markers used to distinguish mesothelioma from pleural metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.PS-13-017 Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in patients of pulmonary adenocarcinoma: Correlation with cancer stem cell markers and prognosis W.-J.

Rulle * , Z. Tsourti, A. Warth, M. Calabuig, E. Verbeken, A. Sejda, R. Kammler, L. Bubendorf, A. Soltermann, on behalf of the ETOP Lungscape Consortium University Hospital Zurich, Dept. of Pathology, SwitzerlandObjective: The tumour suppressor PTEN serves as surrogate biomarker for hyperactive PI3K/Akt signalling, whereby its protein expression is a valuable read-out. However, no consensus regarding the optimal immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol for fixed tissue exists. In this ETOP (European Thoracic Oncology Platform) Lungscape project we correlated pathologist's H-scores with computer-generated intensity measurements. Method: 6 PTEN+ and 6 PTEN-tumour cases were centrally stained on whole sections with 3 different antibodies (MmAb 6H2.1 DAKO, RmAb 138G6 Cell Signaling and RmAb SP218 Spring Bioscience) and the scanned webbook H-scored by ETOP pathologists (range 0-300). Cases were also assembled into an EQA tissue microarray, stained locally with SP218. All stainings were finally analyzed using ImageJ for pixelbased intensity on tumour epithelia. Results: All 3 antibodies successfully differentiated PTEN+ versus PTEN-cases. Computer H-scores were highly associated to pathologists', but with lower averages. Relative variability between centers was higher for PTEN-. On TMAs, computer scores showed lower inter-center variability. For 138G6 and SP218, sensitivity and specificity were high for moderate values of threshold h (0-20). Conclusion: SP218 yields a clean IHC and well separates PTEN+ from PTEN-cases, favouring standardization across laboratories. Pathologists tend to H-score higher than the computer, likely due to integration of various signal intensities.PS-13-020 Is better prognostic stratification of lung carcinoid tumours possible? L. Brcic * , M. Heidinger, A. Zenko Sever, M. Fediuk, M. Jakopovic, S. Seiwerth, F.-M. Smolle-J\u00fcttner, H. Popper * Medizin. Universit\u00e4t Graz, Inst. f\u00fcr Pathologie, AustriaObjective: Lung carcinoid tumours are rare neuroendocrine neoplasms. According to WHO classification typical and atypical forms exist, based on mitotic count and/or necrosis. This grading system is still the best prognostic parameter. Our study aimed to identify markers for subgroups having higher risk of metastasis, progression and worse overall survival. Method: Patients from two institutions who underwent resection between 1971 and 2015 with adequate clinical information and archived material were identified. Tumours were stratified using mitosis count and/ or necrosis. Immunohistochemical assessment of cyclin A, B and E (distinctive expression during cell cycle), neurotrimin, zinc finger protein like 1, and sorting nexin (lost on genomic level as demonstrated previously by arrayCHG and LOH), NCAM isoform 140kdA and Ki67, was performed. Results: 297 patients (M = 148; F = 149; mean age: 49.3) were identified. 202 typical carcinoids (TC) and 95 atypical carcinoids (ATC). NCAM 140 kdA isoform demonstrated negative reaction in practically all TC, while ATC presented with faint reaction. Overall, cyclin E expression was lower in ATC, while cyclin B and A were higher expressed in ATC, especially in the ones with higher mitotic rate. Preliminary data demonstrated protein expression loss of neurotrimin, zinc finger protein like 1, and sorting nexin in ATC. Conclusion: NCAM isoform 140Kd is predominantly expressed in high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas and only minimally in ATC, whereas absent in TC. Different forms of cyclins are activated at specific time during mitosis and better reflect cell-cycle activity compared to Ki67. Staining for cyclins might be better suited for prognostic stratification of patients with carcinoids.PS-13-021 Contributions of cytology examination in the diagnosis of non small cell lung tumours: A retrospective study S. Ben Rejeb * , I. Msakni, M. A. Bani, F. Gargouri, D. Ghachem, O. Bel Hadj Amine, B. Laabidi, A. Bouzaiani Military Hospital of Tunis, Dept. of Pathology, TunisiaObjective: Despite great advances in imaging technology for a better visualization and detection of lung cancer, early diagnosis of the neoplasm remains challenging. Cytology has a considerable contribution in the diagnosis of lung cancer; however it has an imperfect specificity for the subtyping of carcinomas. We aim in this study to determine the diagnostic reliability of pulmonary cytology in the diagnosis of non small cell carcinoma (NSCC). Method: We have compared cytological and histological findings in patients who underwent the diagnostic procedure under suspicion of lung cancer (LC) over a period of 4 years. Results: Of a total of 981 patients, 167 were microscopically diagnosed with a LC which was classified as NSCC in 83, 83 % of cases. The sensitivity and specificity of cytology were 97.94 and 100 %, respectively. The cytology-histology correlation in NSCC group was 65 %. In 5 cases, cytological specimens were highly suspicious of malignancy but assignment to a NSCC or a SCC was not possible. Microscopically, they were classified as a SCC in one case, adenocarcinoma in one case and squamous cell carcinoma in two cases. Conclusion: Cytology is a reliable diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of lung malignancies, however, its contribution in tumour typing remains limited.PS-13-022Quantitative expression analyses of TTF-1 in NSCLC V. Bertram * , C. Zacharia, F. Langer, R. Bohle * Universit\u00e4t des Saarlandes, Medizinische Fakult\u00e4t, Homburg, GermanyObjective: The aim of this study was to enhance diagnostic sensitivity for the detection of primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas. Therefore we analysed TTF-1mRNA by qRT-PCR and needle microdissection in 199 cases. Method: TTF-1 mRNA and protein were detected by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (Clone: 8G7G3/1) in FFPE tumour tissues. Overall 51 acinar (AC) and 50 solid pulmonary adenocarcinomas (SOL) were analysed. 49 pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 49 pulmonary metastasis of colorectal adenocarcinomas (mCRC) served as controls. \u03b22M served as housekeeping gene. Results: TTF-1 mRNA expression was highest in AC and SOL. The Ct values amounted up to 23 \u00d7 10^3. mCRC and SCC showed significantly lower values. TTF-1 mRNA was detected in 88,2 % of AC und 76 % of SOL, but only in 6,5 % of SCC's and 8,1 % of mCRC's. TTF-1 protein was positive in 64,7 % of the AC's and in 60 % of the SOL's. 10 % of SOL's and 25,5 % of AC's were TTF-1 protein neg./mRNA pos. Conclusion: The quantification of TTF-1 mRNA gives additional tumour specific information in 18 % of the TTF-1 neg. pulmonary adenocarcinomas. Thus, TTF-1 transcript quantification from FFPE tumour tissue can be considered as a valuable diagnostic tool, potentially accelerating clinical procedures.PS-13-023Pleural malignant mesothelioma: Evaluation of histopathological types and interventional diagnostic methods H. N. \u00dcrer * , S. Altin, I. C. Kocaturk, N. Arda Yedikule Chest Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Istanbul, TurkeyObjective: We reviewed PMM cases in this study to investigate the diagnostic value and timing of interventional methods and their effects on histopathological types. Method: A total of 164 subjects were included in the study. The subjects were examined in terms of age, gender, histopathological type, diagnosis of PMM as well as number and type of any previous interventions, results of reports and timing of diagnosis. In conclusion, the first diagnostic intervention option should be the minimal invasive method in pathological approach to pleural diseases. When no satisfactory pathological diagnosis could be achieved in PMM suspected patients through clinical and radiological means, we recommend that more invasive methods should be attempted without delay.",

Csanadi * , C. Antfang, \u00c9. Kocsm\u00e1r, C. Kayser, V. Gumpp, J. Rawluk, U. Nestle, S. Wiesemann, M. Werner, G. Kayser University of Freiburg, Surgical Pathology, GermanyObjective: The PI3K/PAKT/mTOR pathway is activated in many cancers, thus reducing apoptosis and allowing proliferation. On the other hand, it can be antagonized by PTEN. In up to 60 % of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung the PIK3/PTEN/AKT pathway is affected. Therefore we investigated the association of the expression between PTEN and pAKT and correlated these data with histological subtypes of NSCLC. Method: Expression of PTEN and pAKT was analyzed by double stain immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays from 444 NSCLC tissues and correlated with clinical and pathological parameters. Results: PTEN expression showed correlation with age and smoking habit. Furthermore, PTEN was significantly higher expressed in adenocarcinoma (p = 0.001). Interestingly, pAKT expression was more intense not only in adenocarcinoma, but also in large cell neuroendocrine lung cancer compared to other NSCLC types (p = 0.001). Moreover, a coexpression of PTEN and pAKT in the same cell occurred prevalently in adenocarcinoma (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The different expression profiles of PTEN and pAKT according to histological subtypes of NSCLC hint at diverging regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in different NSCLC subtypes.PS-13-034 Subcellular localization of PTEN and pAKT correlates with histological grading in NSCLC A. Csanadi * , C. Antfang, \u00c9. Kocsm\u00e1r, C. Kayser, V. Gumpp, J. Rawluk, U. Nestle, S. Wiesemann, M. Werner, G. Kayser * University of Freiburg, Surgical Pathology, GermanyObjective: The activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as well as the loss of PTEN are known tumour inducing factors. Furthermore, the relevance of the subcellular localisation of PTEN and pAKT was lately described. Therefore, we investigated their expression in NSCLC, with special emphasis on protein localisation. Method: In 444 NSCLC-and corresponding non-neoplastic lung tissue the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of PTEN and pAKT was tested by double stain immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinical and pathological parameters. Results: Both PTEN and pAKT were significantly higher expressed in tumour cells in comparison to non-neoplastic lung tissue. Furthermore, cytoplasmic PTEN showed first upregulation toward poorer differentiated tumours and loss in undifferentiated large cell lung cancer samples (p = 0.003). Cytoplasmic pAKT expression got more pronounced with dedifferentiation (p = 0.009). Conclusion: Our data suggest that the subcellular localisation of PTEN and pAKT is important in the dysregulation of the PIK3CA/PTEN/AKT pathway in different histological grading.PS-13-035 Automated ALK and ROS1 FISH: A comparison between Leica Biosystems Kreatech FISH Probes for BOND and manual FISH A. O'Grady * , S. Curry, E. Kay, P. Wong Royal College of Surgeons, Dept. of Pathology, Dublin, IrelandObjective: A panel of lung cancer fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes has been released for use on Leica Biosystems' Bond platforms. These FISH probes were tested on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases side by side with manual methods to compare the quality of staining and the work flow efficiency of the automated FISH assay. Method: A study of 10 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded NSCLC cases were tested with the Kreatech ALK and ROS1 FISH probes on the Leica BOND III platform and compared to the results achieved using manual methods. Results: All automated tests resulted in diagnosable slides with 100 % concordance (n = 20) between the two methods. The hands-on time per sample with the automated probes is reduced by over 1 h. Conclusion: The comparison study showed that the automated FISH assay resulted in an identical clinical outcome to the manual assay. The reduced hands-on time and the possibility for laboratories to combine automated FISH with routine immunohistochemistry workflow, makes FISH on BOND a promising new addition to the test menu of an Anatomical Pathology laboratory.PS-13-036 Determination of EGFR by liquid biopsy in patients with primary large cell carcinoma of lung from November 2015 until March 2016 at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) G.

Enguita Valls * Hospital 12 de Octubre, Dept. of Pathology, Madrid, Spain Objective: Analysis of EGFR in plasm and lung tissue in patients with large cell carcinoma of lung in a period between November 2015 and March 2016 at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre of Madrid. Method: Determination of EGFR by real-time PCR using the Kit System Cobas Z 480 Roche, for genetic screening of mutations, deletions or insertions in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the EGFR gene both DNA circulating blood material and tissue pulmonary.Results: Were performed 62 determinations of EGFR in patients with large cell carcinoma of lung, with an average age of 72 years, of which 17.7 % were positive in plasm, with good agreement with lung tissue determinations, and 3.2 % were not evaluable. Of the positive cases, there was a jarring case that showed positivity in pulmonary tissue and negativity in plasm. However, another case was positive only in plasm. Conclusion: Lung biopsy is the currently used technique for diagnosis of malignancy, even it is an invasive method, sometimes difficult. Therefore liquid biopsy may have an important role in genetic determinations. Because of these findings of the present study, it may be considered liquid biopsy as a method for early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.PS-13-037Prognostic significance of nuclear grade in malignant pleural mesothelioma: A single institution experience S. Erbil * , B. Yaman, A. \u00c7evik, Y. Ertan, A. \u00d6zdil, A. Veral, D. Nart Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Pathology, Izmir, TurkeyObjective: Malignant pleural mesothelioma(MPM) is an uncommon aggresive malignancy associated with asbestosis exposure. We investigated whether certain histomorphologic parameters correlated with survival of surgically resected MPM. Method: From January 2000 to December 2015, we retrospectively reviewed tumour slides of surgical specimens of 30 patients with histologically confirmed MPM. Seven histomophologic features including histological pattern, nuclear grade, depth of invasion, lymphocytic host response(LHR), necrosis, stromal desmoplasia and mitotic index were investigated and analyzed in SPSS 18.0. Results: We classified 90 % of the patients(27 of 30) as epithelial and 10 % of them(3 of 30) were biphasic type. Subtypes were categorized by histological patterns; solid pattern was most common with 36,7 % (11 of 30). Desmoplasia was observed 63,3 % (19 of 30) of cases. LHR was scored as low in 40 %, intermediate in 36,7 % and high in 23,3 % of patients. Invasion depth was above 5 mm in almost all cases with two cases exceptional. We counted less than 5 mitosis/50 HPF in 56,7 % (17 of 30) and five and more mitosis were counted in 43,3 % of cases. Prognostic datas of 11 patients were collected with five of death after surgery. Conclusion: High nuclear grade might be considered significantly associated with death ratio in MPM. Larger series are required to determine associations between morphological features and survival.PS-13-039 Histology versus cytology in the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer: Is it a real advantage? M. A. Bani * , I. Msakni, S. Ben Rejeb, L. Bel Hadj Kacem, D. Ghachem, F. Gargouri, O. Bel Hadj Amine, A. Bouziani, B. Laabidi * Military Hospital of Tunis, Dept. of Pathology, TunisiaObjective: Currently, most cytopathologists are able to correctly distinguish small cell lung cancer (SCLC) from non small cell lung cancer on the basis of cytologic samples, and, indeed, 75 % of lung cancers are diagnosed based on cytology. The authors propose to study the concordance of diagnosis between cytology and histology. Method: Retrospective study of all cases of SCLC diagnosed over a period of 4 years. Results: Over a period of 4 years 981 fine needle aspiration samples were obtained from patients with suspicious thoracic lesions. In 167 patients, a cytological diagnosis of malignancy was obtained, and 168 received a parallel or subsequent histological diagnosis. A total of 25 patients with histologically proven SCLC were included. Sex ratio was 8 and the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 64 (34-87). Cytology was performed in all cases. Only 22 cases were conclusive of SCLC. Cytological and histological typing was concordant in 97 % cases (kappa = 0.97). Immunohistochemistry was conducted in 5 cases to correct the diagnosis. Conclusion: Cytology examination is fairly accurate for typing SCLC and can be regarded as an acceptable procedure for diagnostic. In doubtful cases, the use of ancillary techniques, such as immunocytochemistry, may be required to improve the diagnostic yield.PS-13-040Mesenchymal stem cells-and conditioned medium reduce fibrosis in pulmonary parenchyma but promote increased artery adventitia remodeling in bleomycin-injured mice A.

Results: Pulmonary fibrosis collagen I modulated was significantly reducedin MSC and CMcompared to BLM rats (p < 0.05), whereasa significant increase in fibrosis collagen V modulated was found in PA from MSC rats (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Pulmonary fibrosis collagen I modulate is reverted byMSC and CM treatment However, MSC and CM treatment modulate collagen V fibrosis in PA, thus suggesting a new important link between pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension.Objective: Recently, Trimboli et al. demonstrated that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inactivation in stromal fibroblasts of mouse mammary glands accelerates malignant transformation of mammary epithelial tumours and leads to massive remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM). Based on these findings we investigated the protein expression of PTEN in the immediate peritumoural stroma, called matricellular space, and the corresponding tumour epithelia of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) together with relevant extracellular matrix proteins. Me thod: E xp r e s s i o n o f P T E N a n d E CM p r o t e i n s w e r e immunohistochemically determined on a tumour tissue microarray of 456 patients with NSCLC of all pT stages. Additionally, 48 cases were evaluated on whole slides. Results: PTEN expression in both cytoplasm and nucleus was higher in the matricellular cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) than in the carcinoma epithelia. Complete loss of stromal PTEN was infrequent. High PTEN in both stroma and tumour was associated with lower pT and smaller tumour size. High vimentin, versican and collagen but not periostin expression was positively correlated with PTEN in both tumour and stroma. Conclusion: PTEN loss in both cytoplasm and nucleus occurs more frequently in lung SqCC than AdC. Peritumoural CAFs have a higher PTEN protein expression than the adjacent malignant epithelia. PTEN protein synthesis decreases with increasing tumour size.PS-13-042Pulmonary epithelioid haemangioendothelioma-a case report N. Derrabi * , F. Marnissi, M. Karkouri * Ibn Rochd University Hospital, Pathology Dept., Casablanca, MoroccoObjective: Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE) previously known as intravascular bronchoalveolar tumour. This is a rare disease, with approximately 50 cases described in the literature. Method: We report the case of a 60 year old women with treated for myomateux uterus. We discover by chance in CT scan a basi-thoracic mass left. Left lower lobectomy and lymph node dissection were made. Histological examination concluded epithelioid haemangioendothelioma, confirmed by immunohistochemical study. Results: About 60-80 % of patients with EHE are women. Patient ages range from 7 to 81 years. About 50-70 % of patients are symptomatic at presentation. Imaging show multiple bilateral perivascular nodules, that mimic metastatic cancer or granuloma. At macroscopy, EHE presents with multiple circumscribed nodules with a grey-white cut surface and chondroid appearance. At histopathology, EHE round to oval nodules, composed of strands and solid nests of rounded to slightly spindled cells, with intracytoplasmic lumina containing red blood cells. Most EHE expresses the vascular markers CD31, CD34 and focal cytokeratin expression is present in 25-30 % of cases. Conclusion: This tumour can affect multiple organs. The prognosis is very unpredictable, with life expectancy ranging from 1 to 15 years. There is no single effective treatment, though spontaneous regression and response to chemotherapy and interferon are reported.Objective: Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (SP) is a epithelial tumour, formerly nomed sclerosing haemangioma. We report two cases of SP in two women aged 63 and 45 years. Histological examination and immunohistochemistry was accurate diagnosis of the nature of the tumour. Method: Case 1: 63 year old women, Chest CT shows solitary mass in the right lower lobe. The patient had a lower lobectomy and lymph node dissection. Histological examination concluded SP, confirmed by immunohistochemical study. Case2: 45 year old women treated for breast neoplasm, CT scan done under the staging. Chest CT shows multiple left parenchymal nodules. Histological examination concluded sclerosing pneumocytoma.",

R. Machado * , A. T. Fabro, H. R. Cruvinel, P. d. Santos Le\u00e3o, A. L. dos Santos, C. Bueno, R. A. Oliveira, C. A. Rainho, H. H. Bok Yoo, V. L. Capelozzi * HCFMB-UNESP, Biobank, Botucatu, BrazilObjective: Acutepulmonary thromboembolic (APTE) is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a thrombo that has traveled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream. Our aims was to determinate a plasma microRNA profile as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of APTE. Method: 17APTEpatients and 10 patients and 10 healthy volunteerswere sequentially studied in 2016. All relevant clinical data from medical records andangiotomographyresults were analyzed. An optimized protocol for RNA extraction from plasma samples by Qiagenmirneasy serum/ plasma kit in combination with the Vac-Man\u00ae Vacuum Manifold were used. The Illumina TruSeq Small RNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit was used to generate small RNA library directly from total RNA. Clustering and sequencing was accomplished using the Illumina NextSeq500. Further databases and software used for analysis were the Diana software. Results: Dyspnea was the most common symptoms experienced by patients. Only one patient had deep venous thrombosis. All patients had unchanged echocardiography. High-quality RNA were extracted. Circulating microRNAs were differentially expressed and associated with prognostic outcome (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The MicroRNA profile might reflect alterations in Virchow's triadof APTE, providing some clue for biomarker screening, however it still needed to be validated to clinical practice.PS-13-046 Mutation profile and protein expression for predictive testing in lung adenocarcinoma: A study of 200 patients from Brazil J.

Our aims was to determinate the mutational status versus protein expression is related to impact on survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Method: 200 patients with NSCLC were selected in 2014-2016 for immunohistochemistry and 80 for next generation sequencing. All relevant clinical data from medical records, like survival time, were analyzed. A protocol for DNA extraction from frozen samples by QIAmp DNA kit were used. The Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Sample Prep Kit was used to generate DNA library. Clustering and sequencing was accomplished using the Illumina NextSeq500. Further databases and software used for analysis were the VariantStudio. CD44, EGFR, P53, VEGF, KRAS, HER2, PIK3CA, BRAF and ALK antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry and analyzed by AperioSystem. Results: Different type of mutation were found. The most of them correlated with the respective protein expression. CD44 mutation is present in 33 % of them and related with CD44 expression in a survival time-dependent manner. Mutation status versus protein expression were differentially expressed and associated with prognostic outcome (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Personalized cancer medicine in DNA-based high-throughput genomic technologies might provide excellent results for biomarker screening, however it still needed to be validated to clinical practice.PS-13-047Lung cancer of clinically unknown primary: An autopsy-based study E. Kocsm\u00e1r * , I. Kocsmar, J. Karczub, A. Kiss, Z. Schaff, G. Lotz * Semmelweis University, Faculty of Medicine, Budapest, HungaryObjective: Lung is the most frequent primary site identified by autopsy in the clinical (type-1) Cancer of Unknown Primary origin (CUP) cases. To reveal the factors behind this, our goal was to examine the clinicopathological differences between CUP and non-CUP metastatic lung cancers. vs. 37 % in total and 90 vs. 57 % in adenocarcinomas) furthermore pain as first clinical symptom (26 vs. 13 %) were significantly more common in CUP cases of the lung. Conclusion: Higher frequency of the peripheral localization among lung CUPs can contribute to keeping the primary site clinically hidden. Occurrence of these cases can be reduced by taking into consideration clinicopathological differences of the CUP and non-CUP metastatic lung cancers. Autopsy is necessary for the correct post-mortem identification and classification of CUP cases.PS-13-048 EGFR mutational status in a series of non small cell lung carcinomas: Data from daily practice L. Tadic Latinovic * , Z. Eri, A. Salapura, L. Novakovic Lackovic, M. Stanetic, J. Stanic University Clinical Center, RS, Dept. of Pathology, Banja Luka, Bosnia and HerzegovinaObjective: The prognosis of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still poor. Activating epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are important genetic alterations with dramatic therapeutically implications. Up to now, in contrast to Asian populations only limited data on the prevalence of those mutations are available from patients with European ethnicity. Method: In this study, routine EGFR testing with real-time PCR assay for 198 patients with NSCLC patients from Bosnia and Herzegovina were tested in various types of tumour samples. The incidence of EGFR mutations from clinical routine in Bosnia and Herzegovina was lower than those reported in other Caucasian and European populations. Bozkurtlar * , I. Erbarut Seven, R. A.

Wen * , A. Furtado, A. Sanches, D. Tente * CHVNG/E, Pathology, Vila Nova de Gaia, PortugalObjective: To introduce the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of one case of uncommonly located NUT carcinoma with unusual chromosomal rearrangement. Method: A 22 years old male patient suffered from rapidly progressive pleural effusion. Multiple pleural nodules were identified in CT examination and were surgically biopsied. The specimen was totally submitted for histological examination, including immunohistochemical staining. Detection of special chromosomal rearrangement by FISH was also carried out. Results: Histologically, the tumour was predominantly composed of sheets or nodules of small undifferentiated cells with hyperchromatic nucleus and scant cytoplasm, among which some nests of large cell with vesicular nucleus and ample cytoplasm were observed. The transition between the two kinds of cells was abrupt. Large areas of coagulative necrosis and desmoplasic stroma were present. No obvious squamous differentiation was observed. The tumour cells were diffusely immunoreactive with antibodies to p63, Vimentin, CD34 and NUT protein and focally to SMA. Split of Chromosome 15 was detected by FISH, but rearrangement with BRD4 was not identified. Conclusion: NUT protein positive confirmed the diagnosis, although, in this case, the location, morphology and genetic changes were not typical for nut carcinoma.Akdeniz Uni, School of Med, Pathology, Antalya, TurkeyObjective: Multiple minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules are incidentally found during pathologic examination of lung biopsies. In some patients, these nodules cause diffuse radiologic abnormalities and restrictive lung disease, which has been called as diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis.Method: Here in, we present a 60-year-old woman with this uncommon lesion. She had complaints of dispnea and cough. Computerized tomographic evaluation revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules/densities. She underwent open surgery. Results: Histopathologic evaluation showed multiple interstitial nodules distributed in a randomized fashion. Epithelioid and spindle cells were seen in a vaguely nested growth pattern around vessels. Immunohistochemically, these cells were positive with Vimentin, EMA, Progesterone receptor and Beta-catenin, negative for Melan A, S-100, HMB45, Desmin and estrogen receptor.Conclusion: In the presence of these features, pathologists should be aware of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis in the clinical setting of multiple pulmonary micronodules.

In this report we present a particular case of this condition in a 33 year old male patient, where thymic seminoma emerged within fourth branchial cleft cyst, unusually located in the anterior mediastinum. Method: The patient underwent thoracic computed tomography which showed an anterior mediastinal mass that was removed by thoracotomy. Histopathological and immunohistochemical assesments were performed in order to establish the diagnosis. Results: Histopathological examination reveals a cystic cavity lined by epithelium (positive for AE1/AE3, P63) with a seminomatous germ cell tumour proliferation developed within its walls. The large tumoural cells arranged in sheets and separated by fibrous septa show strong positivity for CD 117, PLAP and D2-40. Around the cyst there are areas of thymic tissue positive for Tdt. Conclusion: The final diagnosis, based on paraclinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features was primary thymic seminoma. To our knowledge, there are no previously reported cases in literature of primary thymic seminoma originated in a fourth mediastinal branchial cleft cyst.

Method: The immunoexpression of p16 on tissue micro-arrays of tumour from 100 resected OSCC cases was correlated with clinical and histopathological parameters and response to therapy [assessed by tumour regression grade (TRG) using Mandard's scoring system].Results: In all, 19 cases were positive for p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 81 were negative. The p16 positive tumours were smaller in size at presentation (mean \u00b1 SE = 4.32 \u00b1 0.34 cm) than p16 negative tumours (mean \u00b1 SE = 6.02 \u00b1 0.33 cm) (p-value: 0.028). The proportion of p16 positive tumours in the middle third oesophagus (12/19; 63.2 %) was higher when compared to p16 negative tumours which were proportionately more in the lower third oesophagus (46/81; 56.8 %) (p-value: 0.048). The p16 positive tumours revealed a better neoadjuvant therapy response in 25 % (3/12) of cases which had scanty residual viable tumour; whereas only 13 % (10/16) of the p16 negative tumours revealed scanty residual viable tumour with predominant fibrosis (p-value: 0.002).Conclusion: The expression of p16, a surrogate marker for HPV, could be used as a useful predictive biomarker in assessment of OSCC. Fraga * , C. Abrantes, P. Serra, R. Oliveira, H. Garcia, L. Prado e Castro * CHUC, Dept. de Anatomia Patol\u00f3gica, Vila Real, Portugal Objective: Thymic adenocarcinomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant epithelial neoplasms showing glandular differentiation and/or mucin production. The extreme rarity and similarity with metastases from adenocarcinomas of other organs makes this a challenging diagnosis, especially in small biopsies. Method: We present an autopsy case of a 61 year old woman with clinical suspected pulmonary thromboembolism. Results: The complete autopsy study revealed a large tumoural mass in the superior anterior mediastinum, with whitish and yellowish areas and firm consistency. Microscopic examination showed a poorly cohesive signet ring cell carcinoma in relation with vestigial thymic structures. There were metastases in thoracic and upper abdominal lymph nodes. The lung showed innumerable micrometastic foci and massive neoplastic thromboembolism in small, medium and large caliber vessels. No other lesions were identified in any other organs. Conclusion: Cause of death was massive pulmonary embolism by a poorly cohesive signet ring cell carcinoma. The presence of the main tumoural mass in the anterior superior mediastinum, coupled with the absence of any other tumoural lesion at autopsy supported the diagnosis of primary thymic adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells (classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma by the 2015 WHO bluebook).

            "text": "BMSI -JPMC, Dept. of Pathology, Karachi, PakistanObjective: The aim of the present study was to observe the expression of p53 gene in selected cases of cutaneous SCC & BCC in local population of Karachi, Pakistan. Method: A total of 64 NMSC cases were selected, morphologically reevaluated and mutations in exon 5-8 of p53 gene were observed. Results: SCC cases showed 34.3 % p53 mutation, most of which i.e. 45.4 % were seen in exon 6. This was followed by 36.3 % mutations in exon 7 and 18.1 % in exon 8 while no mutation was recorded in exon 5. Amongst BCC cases, exon 5 mutation represented 30.7 % of all, followed by 19.2 and 15.3 % exon 6 and exon 8 mutations respectively. Exon 7 mutations were noted in combination with exon 5 in 7.6 % cases and with exon 6 in. 3.8 % cases. Nodular variant showed 11.5 % cases with single exon 8 mutation. Dual exon 8 mutations were observed in combination with exon 6 constituting 15.3 % of BCC cases. Moreover 3.8 % cases of twin morphologies including nodular and pigmented as well as solid and adenoid combinations each also revealed similar combination of exon 6 and 8 mutations. Conclusion: Exon 8 of p53 gene was expressed in moderately and poorly differentiated grades of SCC. Similarly exon 8 expressed either singly or in combination with exon 6 amongst BCC cases was a unique finding in the present study which may have some prognostic implications.PS-15-003Skin stripping method using proteases to evaluate structural stability by a scanning acoustic microscope K. Miura * , Y. Egawa, T. Moriki Hamamatsu University, School of Medicine, Dept. of Health Science, JapanObjective: A scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) can detect tissue stiffness by speed-of-sound (SOS) because harder tissues show greater SOS. Major structural components such as collagens or elastins alter with genetic background, aging and environmental insults. If chemical modifications of these structure proteins are visible, we can evaluate aging, metabolic disorders and damages. To solve this problem, we have developed tissue stripping (TS) method using proteases. Method: Young and elderly skin images were observed by SAM and LM. Pepsin or collagenase were applied on the section and SOS of each component was compared before and after digestion. Results: In elderly skins, dermal fine collagen fibers and degeneted elastic fibers were easily digested by proteases. In younger skins, thick collagen fibers in the dermis showed resistance to proteases. Hypertrophic scars also showed strong resistance to digestions compared with usual wound fibrosis. In the skin of Ehlers-Donlos syndrome, slender dense collagen fibers intermingled with elastic fibers in the dermis showed slower SOS than normal skin. By protease digestion, subtle or no decrease in SOS was found. Conclusion: Structural stability of tissues alters by different conditions and diseases, which can be objectively evaluated by SOS changes by this TS method.PS-15-004Reliability and usefulness of BRAF and NRAS mutational analysis in sentinel lymph nodes of melanoma patients C. Haas * , H. Arnholdt, H. Starz Klinikum Augsburg, Abt. Pathologie, GermanyObjective: There are conflicting results concerning the usefulness of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) for the determination of the mutational status of melanoma patients. We tried to elaborate methods for the reliable determination of the mutational status of SLN metastases in routine diagnostics and evaluated its level of concordance between metastases and primary tumours and thus its usefulness for prognostication and prediction. Method: The mutational spectrum of BRAF and NRAS of SLN melanoma metastases was analyzed by two approaches: 1. DNA was extracted from microdissected SLN-metastases and primaries. The BRAF and NRAS mutation status was then determined by ARMS-PCR and/or Sanger sequencing. 2. RNA was extracted from SLN-metastases, reverse transcribed and analysed by ARMS-PCR. The determined mutational status was compared to that of the corresponding primary. Results: With ARMS-PCR on DNA from microdissected SLN metastases the mutational status of melanomas can be reliably determined and is highly concordant with the primary tumour. Determination of the mutational status based on cDNA is less sensitive and, therefore, the rate of discordance between SLN metastasis and primary is higher. Conclusion: With adequate methods the mutational status of SLN metastases of melanoma patients can be reliably determined and is of prognostic and predictive value.PS-15-006 Recurring multifocal cutaneous leiomyosarcomas in a patient with childhood history of bilateral retinoblastoma A. Dumitru * , T.-A. Georgescu, M. Sajin, A. Chefani, A. M. Lazaroiu, G. Simion, M. Costache * University Emergengy Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Bucharest, RomaniaObjective: Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma is an uncommon malignant tumour arising from the smooth muscle cells of the dermis, accounting for less that 3 % of all superficial soft tissue sarcomas. Most cases develop in adult Caucasian males in the sixth decade of life. Although these tumours may develop virtually anywhere, they tend to have a predilection for the extensor surfaces of the extremities, as well as the scalp and torso. Most of the time they are solitary, measuring between 0.5 and 3 cm in diameter and presenting no regional or distant metastases after complete surgical excision. Recent genetic studies reveal that mutations of the Rb gene may lead to the development of retinoblastoma, as well as leiomyosarcoma Method: We report the case of a 41 year-old patient, with early childhood history of bilateral retinoblastoma, presenting in 2013 with two tumours located in the left axilla and in the right gluteal region. Results: The tumours were histopathologically diagnosed as cutaneous leiomyosarcomas. The patient returned in June 2015 with three more cutaneous leiomyosarcomas, which were surgically removed, with negative safety margins. The tumours were located on the left thigh, left axilla and right pectoral, respectively. In January 2016 the patient had a third presentation, with several new cutaneous leiomyosarcomas: on the left thigh, in the middle third of the right forearm and in the deltoid, subumbilical and the posterior cervical regions. Conclusion: We believe that this unusual presentation of multiple recurrent cutaneous leiomyosarcomas, as well as the childhood history of bilateral retionoblastoma are most likely linked to a mutation in the Rb gene. However, genetic testing should be performed in order to confirm this assumption.PS-15-007 Expressomics investigation of MHC II positive areas in melanoma F. M. Bosisio * , Z. Kalender Atak, J. Wouters, J. van den Oord Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Translational Cell and Tissue Research, BelgiumObjective: Melanoma has an enhanced immune resistance. One of the mechanisms is immune modulation. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules can be expressed by melanoma cells, thereby participating in immune modulation. MHC class II have a controversial role in melanoma, with some studies associating them with unfavorable outcome and others with regression. To clarify their role in melanoma, we microdissected HLA-DR positive and negative areas in the same melanoma and compared their expressomics. Method: 58 melanoma metastasis were collected from the Department of Pathology of the KU Leuven. Immunohistochemical staining were obtained for HLA-DR. Two cases with heterogeneous HLA-DR expression were selected. HLA-DR positive and negative areas were microdissected and compared after Next Generation Sequencing. Bioinformatic and pathway analysis were performed. Results: 70 genes were upregulated in HLA-DR+ areas. Most of them were immune-related. Most of these genes favoured an immune suppressive inflammatory environment. Moreover, they indicated the presence of a mixed B and T infiltrate and of molecules involved in T-B cross talk and germinal center formation. Pathway analysis confirmed these findings. Conclusion: HLA-DR positive melanoma areas present an immunerelated molecular phenotype, with an expressomic signature suggestive for an immune suppressive microenvironment and a germinal center-like reaction.PS-15-008In situ evaluation of the correlation between the pattern of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, INF-gamma levels and MHC molecules expression in melanoma metastasis: Remarks to the current morphologic classificationF. M. Bosisio * , M.-S. Dheur, J. Wouters, N. Volders, M. Stas, N. van Baren, J. van den Oord Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Translational Cell and Tissue Research, BelgiumObjective: The pattern of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (\"TILs\") is a known prognostic factor in melanoma, with a brisk infiltrate having the best, and an absent infiltrate the worst prognosis. Though, there is a lack of knowledge on the functional status of these TILs in these categories in patient's tissue. For stratification of patients that may benefit from immunotherapy, knowledge of this TILs-status is mandatory. Method: 58 melanoma metastases were collected from the Department of Pathology of the KU Leuven. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed for HLA ABC, TAP1, TAP2, CD8, CXCL9. CD8+ TILs were classified in brisk, non-brisk and absent. CD8, CXCL9 and INF\u03b3 levels were measured by qPCR. CD8 mRNA quantification did not correlate with INF\u03b3 levels nor with MHC I expression. Considering the CD8 patterns, instead, a correlation was found: the \"brisk\" category was invariably associated with high levels of INF\u03b3 and MHC I overexpression, while the \"absent\" category invariably had low INF\u03b3. The \"non-brisk\" category turned out to be very heterogeneous regarding INF\u03b3 levels.Conclusion: A thorough functional evaluation of the \"non-brisk\" category is needed for further stratification of patients in need of immune checkpoint therapy. Okubo * , M. Nishiya, S. Yasuhira, C. Maesawa, T. Masuda Iwate Medical University, Dept. of Pathology, Japan Objective: We have examined how forced expression of the NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (NQO1), a major quinone-reducing enzyme in cytosol, affects the survival of Rhododendrol (RD) -treated cells.Method: The growth inhibitory effect of carnosic acid (CA) and RD or its metabolite on the normal human epidermal melanocyte (NHEM, HEMn-LP/hTERT-1) and B16BL6 cells was assessed by cell counting and WST assay and Western blot. Melanin quantification was detected by spectrophotometry after cells were treated with CA and RD. Results: We found that treatment of the mouse melanoma cell line B16BL6 or normal human melanocytes with carnosic acid, a transcriptional inducer of the NQO1 gene, notably suppressed the cell killing effect of RD. This effect was mostly abolished by ES936, a highly specific NQO1 inhibitor. Moreover, conditional overexpression of the human NQO1 transgene in B16BL6 led to an expression-dependent increase of cell survival after RD treatment. Conclusion: Our present results clearly demonstrated that forced expression of NQO1 mitigates the cytotoxicity of RD without notably affecting the inhibition of melanin synthesis. An obvious explanation for this is that NQO1 reduces quinone compounds originating from RD to less toxic catechol forms.PS-15-010A unique haematopoietic malignancy in a 73 year old Iranian male E. Smyth * , C. Shilling, J. Quinn, G. Murphy, M. Leader * Beaumont Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Dublin, IrelandObjective: A 73 year-old male presented with a 6 month history of an enlarging exophytic lesion on the lower back. The lesion was itchy, the patient had no systemic symptoms. Method: A biopsy was taken.Results: Histopathlogy showed an infiltrate of large undifferentiated lymphocytes. MIB1 was expressed in over 90 % of malignant cells.Immunohistochemistry and cMYC rearrangement studies demonstrated that the malignant cells were positive for CD45, CD4 and cMYC but negative for other markers. cMyc translocation was present on FISH analysis. PCR revealed a B-cell clone. Bone-marrow biopsy was negative. PET scanning confirmed extensive lymph-node involvement. The diagnosis was a primary cutaneous haematopoietic malignancy with systemic involvement. The patient was commenced on treatment, there was significant reduction in tumour size at 6 weeks.Conclusion: This case presented a diagnostic challenge for the following reasons: The indolent clinical presentation and the negative bone-marrow biopsy were not in keeping with the high proliferation rate and primitive nature of the tumour. The neoplasm was exceptionally primitive and thus negative by immunohistochemistry for B-cell markers. Molecular analysis was required to determine a B-cell clone. Similar cases have not been reported in the literature.PS-15-011 Correlation between clinico-pathological features of oral lichen planus and concomitant treatments J. M.

Blanco Carri\u00f3n * Clinical Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Santiago de Compostela, Spain Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the correlation of the histopathological features and clinical variants of lichen planus, as well as with age, gender or concomitant medical treatments. Method: We have studied 59 adult patients (36 females and 23 males) cases with firm clinical and histopathological diagnosis of OLP. Clinical parameters recorded included age, sex, location of the lesions in the oral cavity, clinical variant of OLP, toxic habits (alcohol and smoking) and concomitant treatments. Histopathologically, the presence of ulceration, degree of interface lesion, distribution, intensity and composition of the inflammatory infiltrate were evaluated. Patients taking multiple drugs seem to present a form of OLP more severe with atrophy and erosion of the epithelium Plasma cells are most commonly found in cases showing deeper infiltrate inflammatory infiltration. PS-15-012 Value of the histopathological features in predicting B-RAF status in cutaneous malignant melanoma J. M. Su\u00e1rez Pe\u00f1aranda * , O. Figueroa Silva, A. Estany Gestal, M. Bouso, C. Aliste, M. D. S\u00e1nchez Aguilar Clinical Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Santiago de Compostela, Spain Objective: Establishing the relation between several histopathological features of cutaneous melanomas (CM) and the presence of V600E B-RAF mutation and infer, if possible, its presence from the pathological characteristics of the neoplasm. Method: We have retrospectively reviewed 90 cases of CM and have assessed the presence of V600E B-RAF mutation on paraffin embedded tissue (Cobas\u00ae 4800, Roche). The histopathological features evaluated were lateral circumscription of the lesion, the percentages of melanocytes along the basal layer and nest formation, predominance of epithelioid or spindle cells and degree of pigmentation.Results: B-RAF mutated melanomas showed better lateral circumscription than those with wild-type B-RAF (52 vs. 33,3 %) and over 50 % of the neoplastic cells formed well-defined nests (33,3 vs. 21.7 %). The percentages of melanocytes along the basal layer were very similar in mutated and non-mutated lesions. Large amounts of cytoplasmic melanin were only present in non-mutated melanomas (12,5 vs. 0 %) and predominance of epithelioid cells was noted in mutated melanomas (73,1 vs. 65,6 %). Nevertheless, differences were never statistically significant. Conclusion: According to our results the predictive value of histopathological features is not accurate enough to infer the B-RAF status.PS-15-013The first Danish family reported with an AQP5 mutation presenting diffuse non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma, hyperhidrosis and frequent corynebacterium infectionsA.

Tsiliaka * , A. Linardou, S. Pappa, A. Dimitriadi, C. Karambogias, E. Mpoulios, P. Konstantopoulou, G. Kakiopoulos * General Hospital of Athens, G. Gennimatas, Dept. of Surgical Pathology, GreeceObjective: Cutaneous nocardiosis is a rare infectious disease. It is often misdiagnosed because of its rarity and nonspecific clinical presentation. It typically affects immunosuppressed individuals with a history of trauma and can be subdivided into 3 clinical entities that include: Lymphocutaneous infection, superficial skin infection and cellulitis. Method: The patient (with history of Wegener disease under therapy) presented with a circumscribed, whitish-red skin lesion of left leg and clinical diagnosis of erythema nodosum was considered. Biopsy was performed. Macroscopic examination revealed a whitish-red, circumscribed lesion measuring 1,15 \u00d7 0,8 \u00d7 0,7 cm. Results: Histological examination revealed chronic inflammation of the papillary dermis and an area of acute inflammation in the reticular dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, with a small central abscess. This was surrounded by smaller, similar lesions. Staining for PAS and GMS was negative. These findings were compatible with Sweet Syndrome. However later clinical examinations revealed a Nocardia infection. Thus a special modification of GMS was carried out, which showed Nocardia aggregates in the dermis. Conclusion: In such cases, it is important to take into consideration all clinical information in addition to the histological results, in order to reach a correct diagnosis.PS-15-015 Squamoid eccrine ductal carcinoma: Report of two cases H. Sahin * , F. E. Kombak, Z. D. Akdeniz Dogan, Z. L. Cinel Marmara University, Pathology, Istanbul, TurkeyObjective: Squamoid eccrine ductal carcinoma (SEDC) is an extremely rare variant of ductal eccrine carcinoma which represents less than 0.01 % of all cutaneous tumours. As our knowledge is limited to very few case reports, biological potential of tumour is still debatable. We report two cases diagnosed as SEDC in our department. Results: Case 1: An 80 year-old female patient presented with a lesion on her forehead. A punch biopsy was misdiagnosed as SCC. Excisional biopsy showed squamous and ductal areas, frequent mitosis, and extensive perineural invasion. P63, CEA, and EMA stainings were positive.Case 2: A 43 year-old male patient presented with a lesion on his lower abdomen. An excisional biopsy performed. Squamous and ductal components, keratin cysts, stromal hyaline degeneration, and perineural invasion were noted. Tumour was positive with P63, P40, CEA, and EMA. Conclusion: SEDC usually occurs on extremities,scalp, and trunk of middle aged or elder patients. Tumour nests, which are composed of ductal (eccrine) and squamous features,are diagnostic. SEDCs have a better prognosis than other eccrine carcinomas. Differential diagnosis includes SCC, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, porocarcinoma, malign mixed tumour, and metastatic tumours. Further information is needed to understand SEDCs.",

Pruetpongpun, P. Rerknimitr * Dept. of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, ThailandObjective: To demonstrate histopathology of Penicillium marneffei infection in AIDS and anti-interferon gamma autoantibodies patients. Method: Retrospective descriptive study of cutaneous penicillosis confirmed by tissue culture and histology at Thammasat University Hospital during2007-2015.   Results: Only three patients were available for study. Case 1 had AIDS with multiple umbilicated lesions on face and trunk. Case 2 and 3 had anti-interferon gamma autoantibodies, suggestive of adult-onset immunodeficiency. Case 2 presented with multiple erythematous papules and nodules confluent to plaques at the upper chest, neck, and face. Case 3 had multiple abscesses and ulcers with sporotrichoid pattern at left forearm. The histopathologic features include mixed inflammatory cells in-Cutaneous penicillosis in immunocompromized hosts has variable clinical presentations and histopathologic features. The predominant histopathologic features are interstitial infiltration of mixed inflammatory cells, non-necrotizing granuloma (often poorly-formed), and superficial ulcers. In AIDS case, the intracellular yeasts are abundant, without granulomatous response. In contrast to anti-interferon gamma autoantibodies cases, the yeasts are rare with granulomatous response.PS-15-021 Primary cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma: A misleading tumour S. Ben Rejeb * , D. Ghachem, A. Dhaoui, W. Bayoudh, A. Souissi, A. Ayari, R. Ben Romdhane, K. Bellil Military Hospital of Tunis, Dept. of Pathology, TunisiaObjective: Tumours arising from myoepithelial cells are rare and mostly benign. Most malignant variant reported cases arise from salivary gland. Only 11 cases of cutaneous myoepithelial carcinoma (CMEC) were reported. We aim to describe a case of CMEC with a brief review of literature. Method: A 50-year old woman presented with a nodular well circumscribed flesh-colored lesion of 7 mm, located on the nasal wing. Surgical excision was performed. Results: Histopathological examination revealed a dermal poorly differentiated neoplasm arranged in a solid pattern. Cells were epithelioid with an abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and centrally located or eccentric nuclei containing prominent nucleoli. Tumour stroma was fibrous. Surgical margins were infiltrated. Six months later, tumour recurred, showing almost all histological features initially observed with more marked nuclear atypia. Mitotic rate was 4/10HPF. At immunohistochemistry, cells expressed vimentin, CK7 and S100 protein. Mib-1 index was 50 %. Negative staining for cytokeratin/androgen receptors/ PHDLA1 and p63 ruled out an adnexal tumour. Vascular markers (CD34/CD31/ERG), muscular markers (desmin/caldesmon/actin/ myogenin), histiocytar markers (CD68/CD163/MMP11), plasmacytic markers (CD138/mum-1) and melanocytic markers (Melan-A/ HMB45) were negative. Conclusion: CMEC has variable morphologic and immunohistochemical features, expressing at a varying degree both epithelial and muscle specific markers. CMEC may thus be misdiagnosed as no single profile is diagnostic.PS-15-022 Intralymphatic nevus cells in benign neviC. Leblebici * , C. Kelten, M. S. Gurel, E. Hacihasanoglu * Istanbul Education and Research Center, Dept. of Pathology, TurkeyObjective: The histogenesis of nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes is controversial and various hypotheses have been used to explain their origin. One of them is the transport of cells from cutaneous nevi or lesions to lymph nodes, called mechanical transport theory. We investigated in our cases of benign nevi to obtain evidence to substantiate this theory. Method: 369 benign cutaneous nevi were prospectively evaluated in excisional biopsy samples. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD31 and podoplanin (D2-40) were performed in the cases with intralymphatic nevus cell aggregate (ILNA), suspected for ILNA and/or intralymphatic nevus cell protrusion (ILNP). Results: A total of 13 intralymphatic nevus cell aggregates (ILNAs) were found in 10 patients. Six ILNA were verified with their histology as well as immunohistochemically with D2-40 and CD31. Protrusions of nevus cells inside the lymphatics (ILNP) were seen in all cases of ILNA and also in 27 nevi where an ILNA was not observed. Conclusion: We suggested that ILNAs can be dislodged with local minor trauma and be carried inside the lymphatic vessel to the draining lymph node. Our findings supported the mechanical transport theory.Objective: Porocarcinoma is a rare malignant tumour but the most frequently encountered malignancy of the sweat glands. It is a rare association with Jadassohn nevus. Method: We present a case of a 69 years old female with a porocarcinoma arising in a Jadassohn nevus of the scalp. Results: The tumour had 1,5/1,5/0,5 cm, white and yellow appearance and ulcerated. Microscopic aspects included basaloid, squamoid and pleomorphic features, with high mitotic rate (22 mitosis/ HPF), a clearly infiltrative growth pattern and connection to underlying epidermis. The tumoural proliferation formed ductal structures. Desmoplasia and little necrosis were present. In the periphery of the malignant lesion, signs of a remaining Jadassohn nevus were present: some acanthosis and papillomatosis, foci of basaloid hair papillae-like proliferations and rare apocrine glands. Tumoural proliferation was positive for panCK, p63, p16 and p53, focally positive for EMA and negative for BerEp4. Endoluminal ductal cells were highlighted by CEA, EMA and CK7. Ki67 index was about 20 %. Conclusion: Histopathological aspects and immunohistochemical profile sustain the diagnosis of porocarcinoma and a remaining Jadassohn nevus. Probably most porocarcinomas reported in scalp location were developed on Jadassohn nevus which could represent a risk factor.PS-15-024Primary extramammary Paget's disease: Report of 13 cases A. Konstantinova * , K. V. Shelekhova* Dept. of Pathology, Clinical Research and Practical Center for Spec. Oncological Care, St. Petersburg, RussiaObjective: Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a rare neoplasm usually presenting in the anogenital area. We report characteristics of the 13 cases. Method: We measured the depth from the epidermal surface to the deepest located tumour cell in the adnexa. We used the Allred Score for steroid receptor evaluation and CAP recommendations for HER 2 results reporting. Results: There were 12 females and 1 male. Median age was 66,9 years. The lesions were solitary and occurred in the anogenital area. Two patients had recurrences of the EMPD. Three patients had history of breast cancer and one had mammary Paget's disease. Morphology was similar in all cases: large tumour cells had clear and pale granular cytoplasm and round nuclei. Tumour cells formed solitary units, solid nests and glandlike structures in the epidermis. Hair follicles and eccrine ducts were the most commonly affected adnexal parts, maximal depth of involvement was 2.9 mm. ERs were positive in 4 cases. PRs were positive in one case. ARs were positive in 8 cases. Her2/neu staining was positive in 4 cases and coexpression of Her2/neu and AR were found in 4 cases.Conclusion: Described morphological and IGH characteristics of EMPD should be taken into account when planning therapy. Leblebici * , E. Pasaoglu, C. Kelten, S. Darakci, N. Dursun Istanbul Education and Research Center, Dept. of Pathology, TurkeyObjective: The clinical and histopathological distinction between keratoacanthoma (KA) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is often troublesome. We investigated the utility of CK 17 and Ki-67 in distinguishing between KA and SCC. Method: Immunohistochemical staining patterns for CK 17 and Ki-67 were evaluated in 24 KA and 27 SCC cases. The pattern of staining was evaluated as central, peripheral and diffuse according to basal/peripheral and suprabasal/central cell staining in tumour lobules. Results: We found that 22 of 24 (92 %) KAs stained with a peripheral pattern for Ki-67 and a central pattern for CK 17, while only 2 of 27 SCCs (7 %) displayed the same pattern. The majority of SCCs(16/27, 59 %)   stained with the diffuse pattern for both markers. The sensitivity and specificity of the central staining pattern of CK 17 for identifying KA was 92 and 70 % respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of the diffuse staining pattern of Ki-67 in favor of SCC was 81 and 100 % respectively. Conclusion: The diffuse staining pattern of Ki-67 is useful for the diagnosis of SCC, while the central staining pattern of CK17 is in favor of KA. Ki-67 and CK 17 may be useful in differentiating between KA and SCC.Samara Medical University, General and Clinic Pathology, RussiaObjective: We presented a case of coexisting diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DBCL) with primary cutaneous Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in metastatic lymph nodes(LNs) in parotid gland.

Also 21.6 % patients were below 40 years. Most (43.6 %) were well differentiated carcinomas with the poorer grade tumours occurring in the younger age groups. Of the 140/175samples tested for microsatellite instability (MSI) status, 45 patients (32.1 %) were high frequency MSI (MSI-H). A right sided location and poor differentiation correlated with MSI-H tumours (p values of 0.013 and <0.001 respectively). The strongest associations were found between MSI-H status and residual adenomatous tissue, worse tumour grade, more Crohn-like feature and more advanced pathological staging with p values <0.001 each.Conclusion: High frequency MSI (MSI-H) colorectal carcinomas were frequent in the study. The disease occurred earlier. Premalignant (adenomatous) lesions were few possibly accounting for the low rate. These point to the CIMP pathway in their tumourigenesis.

Method: The study was conducted in Oncology Center, Mansoura University from March 2008 to December 2014. A retrospective analysis was done for intraoperative FS for suspected ovarian neoplasms. The FS and permanent paraffin section (PS) results were compared and the overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were determined. Results: The study included 105 patients and the overall accuracy of FS in determining malignancy was 81.7 %. The sensitivity for malignant tumours was 75.32 % with specificity of 100 %. For benign tumours, the sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 93 %, respectively. Borderline tumours had the lowest sensitivity of 100 % with specificity of 95.19 %. Conclusion: The present study concurs that frozen section is an accurate test for diagnosis of benign and malignant tumours in postmenopausal women thus determining the extent of surgery done for them. On the other hand, accuracy rates for borderline tumours are low.E-PS-07-006Metastatic endocervical adenocarcinoma in a mature cystic teratoma: A case of tumour-to-tumour metastasis F. Santos * , C.

Nov\u00e1 * General University Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Prague, Czech RepublicObjective: Epithelioid trophoblastic tumour (ETT) is a very rare tumour with a differentiation toward chorionic-type intermediate trophoblastic cells. The tumour originates mostly in the uterine corpus, lower uterine segment or cervix. Only about 20 cases arising in the extrauterine location have been reported so far. Method: We report a case of a 31-year-old female with ETT arising in endometrioid cyst of the fallopian tube. Results: A 31-year-old female underwent unilateral salpingectomy during a laparoscopic surgery for a suspicion of tubal endometriosis. Grossly, the fallopian tube was dilated with a cystic lesion in the wall. Histologically, the cystic formation consists of typical structures of endometrioid cyst with multiple foci of trophoblastic cells, which reepithelialized the inner surface of the cyst. Conclusion: Hereby we described the first case of ETT arising in endometrioid cyst, which was moreover located in the fallopian tube. We should be aware of the possibility of unusual primary locations of this rare tumour. The differential diagnosis includes the other trophoblastic tumours and lesions, epithelioid smooth m u s c l e t u m o u r a n d s q u a m o u s c e l l c a r c i n o m a . Acknowledgements: This work was supported by Ministry of Health, Czech Republic (Project RVO-VFN 64165). associated and a TCR monoclonal population with no IgH rearrangement in the cutaneous lesion. Conclusion: We present a metachronous B and T cell PTLD. Coexistence of T and B cell PTLD are extremely rare with only six cases reported. T/NK cell PTLD are infrequent and EBV is usually negative. Most of primary cutaneous PTLD are of T-cell origin (mostly mycosis fungoides) in the largest series published.E-PS-08-018 Heparin-tryptase complex in mast cells I. Buchwalow * , D. Atyakshin, V. Samoilova, W. Boecker, M. Tiemann * Institute for Hematopathology, Immunohistology, Hamburg, GermanyObjective: Mast cells play a central role in numerous diseases. When activated, mast cells degranulate and release granule-derived mediators including tryptase and heparin. Much knowledge has been gathered about tryptase activation by heparin, but little is still known about the state of heparin-tryptase complexes. To address this issue, we examined in situ heparin-tryptase complexes of mast cells in human tissues. Method: We performed double fluorescent labeling of heparin and tryptase in mast cells. Heparin was visualized using a fluorescent dye berberine. Tryptase was detected using immunohistochemical technique. Results: Double labeling of tryptase and heparin allowed us to differentiate mast cells of three distinct physiological states: (a) mast cells containing only tryptase, (b) mast cells containing only heparin, and (c) mast cells containing both tryptase and heparin in their secretory granules. Furthermore, we compared the efficiency of counting mast cells stained for heparin and tryptase with other methods used for mast cell detection. Conclusion: Tryptase immunolabeling permits to identify significantly much more mast cells than other staining methods and therefore can be recommended as a routine stain for counting mast cells in diagnostic labs. Double staining of heparin and tryptase can also be used for characterization of mast-cell sub-populations depending on tissue localization. Objective: Disseminated cryptococcal infection is an uncommon initial manifestation with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Method: We report a rare case of a 50-year-old male without medical history, who was referred to our hospital for evaluation of pancytopenia. He presented with fever and bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. On examination, there was mild splenomegaly. Complete blood count reading showed mild anemia, leucopenia with severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were done to evaluate pancytopaenia. Results: The bone marrow aspiration showed no hemoparasites or immature cells. Bone marrow biopsy showed small aggregates of histiocytes, foamy cells, showing a diffuse hyperplasia, and the presence of refractile yeast like organisms suggestive of cryptococcal species. Alcian PAS stain showed thick capsule positive for acid mucopolysaccharide. No granulomatous response was seen. A diagnosis of cryptococcosis of bone marrow was made. A HIV infection was suspected and the elisa test result and westernblot confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusion: Bone marrow examination plays a critical role in diagnosing opportunistic fungal infection like cryptococcosis as a cause of pancytopenia and leads us to suspect and confirm HIV infection in this case.Objective: Laryngeal cancer accounts for 5 % of male cancers and 25 % of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. The highest incidence is found in Europe. he aim of this work is to have a rough idea of its impact in our population. Method: Our study focused on 150 samples collected at the pathological anatomy department of the University Hospital of Constantine extended over a 5 year period from January 2010 to December 2014. The fixer used is Formalin 10 %. Close examination of the surgical specimen after inking allows to take samples buoyant compared to surgical excision margins. The samples are cut into thin sections of 4 \u03bcm thickness and plated onto g l as s s li d e s a n d t h e n c o l o re d wi t h h e m at o x y l i n e o s i n . Immunohistochemical examinations are made at the request case by case. Results: Among the 150 laryngeal tumours diagnosed, 148 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, fibrosarcoma and malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The gender distribution has shown a male predominance a sex ratio of 1M / 0,08W. The age of our patients varies between 37 and 87 years with an average age of 63,40 years. The age group most affecteted is between 60 and 69 years. The mature well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent histological type represented by 112 cases. Conclusion: Cancers of the larynx are linked to a vast majority predominantly male which is consistent with the literature smoking and partly alcoholism. The mature well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent type. Early diagnosis at the time of dysphonia allows conservative treatment.",

Laplace-Builh\u00e9 * Gustave Roussy, Dept. de Biopathologie, Villejuif, FranceObjective: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical value of Full-Field Optical Coherence Tomography (FFOCT) imaging in the management of patients with Head and Neck cancers, by making a reliable histological diagnosis on FFOCT images produced from surgical specimens. FFOCT produces \"optical biopsy\" images quite similar to that obtained with classical histological procedures, but without any tissue preparation and in a few minutes. Method: We performed images of healthy and cancerous samples from surgical specimens of oral cavity, pharynx and larynx. All images were interpreted in a random way by two pathologists. The FFOCT based diagnostic was compared with the histological slides, in order to constitute an image atlas. Results: FFOCT images provided a quick assessment of microscopic tissue architecture and could be easily used by both pathologists. The correlative study is in progress and preliminary results are reported here. Conclusion: FFOCT is a fast, non-invasive imaging tool that can be inserted into the pathology lab workflow to provide a quick microscopic assessment of tissue. With a similar system with a rigid endoscopic probe, in vivo and in situ imaging could be performed and thus guide the surgeon in real time during endoscopy or surgery. Objective: To investigate a sensitive marker that contributes to progression from normal tissue to premalignant laryngeal lesions (PLLs) and from PLLs to laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) . Method: In 116 PLLs and LSCC patients and 19 without dysplasia matched sets of tissue and plasma samples from Beijing Tongren Hospital, miR-21 was analysed by droplet digital PCR and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction based on paraffin-embedded tumour tissue and plasma. Results: Compared with controls, miR-21 levels in tissue and plasma were significantly higher for both PLL and LSCC groups (for both groups vs controls: P < 0.0001 for tissue; P < 0.05 for plasma). Areas under receiver-operating curves (AUC) for tissue miR-21 were PLL group vs controls: 0.9026 and LSCC group vs controls: 0.8681. For plasma miR-21, AUCs were PLL group vs controls: 0.7355 and LSCC group vs control: 0.6723. Conclusion: The present study indicates that miR-21 is involved in progression from normal to PLLs and from PLLs to LSCC. Furthermore, normalized PCR results for miR-21 might be used to discriminate between normal and ordinary hyperplasia before the emergence of dysplasia and premalignant lesions with malignant potential.

Pontinha, D. Grangeia, M. Ferraz-Oliveira * CHLC-EPE / FCM-UNL, Anatomia Patol\u00f3gica / Anatomia, Lisboa, PortugalObjective: Actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative granulomatous inflammation caused by anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria of Actinomyces species. In abdominopelvic actinomycosis,primary gastric actinomycosis have rarely been reported. Factors that precipitate intra-abdominal actinomycosis include surgery, inflammation, and visceral perforation. There is no specific radiological or endoscopic appearance and the image findings usually include an infiltrative lesion with diffuse gastric wall thickening, highly suggestive of a neoplastic disease. Method: Case report with literature review. Results: A 70 years-old man with a tubular adenocarcinoma of antrum (pT2N0M0), submitted to a subtotal gastrectomy with sequent gastrojejunostomy. On the third year of follow-up he presented with diffuse abdominal pain and abdominal distention, with no history of fever or other symptoms. CT-scan and endoscopy were performed and findings were consistent with recurrence. Even though no tumour was documented by biopsies the patient was submitted to a resection of the anastomosis and residual stomach. The histologic examination revealed a transmural inflammatory process associated with the presence of suture material and of Grocott's, and Gram positive morphologically consistent with Actinomyces. Conclusion: Although extremely rare, gastric actinomycosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gastric wall thickening and tumour-like or infiltrative lesions, particularly in patients with history of previous gastric surgery. Objective: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a vascular proliferative disorder, occurs in HHV8 infected patients as is influenced by immune status. Usually limited to skin it may involve mucosae, visceral organs and lymph nodes. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder affecting neuromuscular transmission. It is associated with thymoma in 15 % of the cases, and for those the neoplasm should be removed. The treatment can also include radiotherapy and/or pharmacological options, including immunosuppressive drugs. Method: Case report with literature review. Results: A 50 years old male patient with MG and thymoma submitted to thymectomy and treated with immunosuppressive therapy. During follow-up, after surgery, an expansive maxillary sinus was diagnosed and undertaken by endoscopic surgery. At that time, the histologic report concluded for a \"kaposiform hemangioendothelioma\". Five years after, his MG relapsed and more immunosuppressive therapy was prescribed. A few months after, newly pigmentation skin lesions appeared and were biopsied. The pathologic findings were consistent with KS. The previous maxillary tumour was then reviewed and the evidence of positivity for HHV8 turned it to a Kaposi sarcoma. Conclusion: KS is a rare disease, but incidence varies according to individual factors such as immune status of the patient. A potential correlation between KS and MG can be considered. Objective: In era of smart phone, we send e-mail for second opinion, and discussed with each other in chatting smart phone application such as Line messenger, Google Hangouts or Kakaotalk. But scanning glass slide was time-consuming and hard work, whatever if you could use brandnew slide scanner from Leica's Aperio digital pathology. Capturing image from Olympus microscope with camera was used in daily practice for conference and hospital-to-hospital discussion, but it is expensive and there are a few microscopes with Olympus camera in one hospital. Microscope adapter for smart phone could be fascinating alternative method to get pathology photo. There are some adaptors in market, but they have some disadvantages for using daily practice by pathologists. Method: Two commercial adaptors were tested to capture pathology image by smart phone for presentation and interdepartment consultation. Microscopes from Olympus, Nikon and Leica were also used.Results: The quality of microscopic photo was suitable for use in presentation using any smart phone adaptors. Conclusion: Microscope adapter for smart phone works well for capturing useful pathologic image.",

Naqvi * Hamilton, CanadaObjective: Determine sought after practice-related pathology information. Method: We surveyed online pathology information users via an open access pathology website and recruited via informal appeals, Facebook and Twitter. Results: Twenty-seven surveys were completed, relatively few in relation to the unique visitors numbers of the web site during the survey period (~4000). The most sought after elements (1-2 of 5 point scale) were images (80 %), microscopic descriptions (76 %), information on immunohistochemical stains (68 %), reporting/sign out language (68 %), and image annotations (60 %). Less sought after information included special stains (52 %), additional references (40 %), cancer staging (36 %) and grossing (32 %). Respondents frequently (1-2 of 5 point scale) sought information from colleagues (75 %), offline textbooks (60 %), search engines (56 %), open databases (e.g. PubMed, Google Scholar) (52 %), review journal papers (33 %), open access sources-other than the hosting web site (44 %), login services (36 %) and Wikipedia (20 %). Conclusion: Images and microscopic descriptions are likely the most sought after elements online. The interest in sign out terminology may represent a desire to simplify and standardize reporting. Users of pathology information online still rely heavily on offline resources.

A. Milner jr. * , B. Holladay * Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dept. of Pathology, Boston, USA -Thursday, 29 September 2016 .3 E-PS-12 IT in Pathology Objective: A primary goal of any health care system should be to attain universal access for all patients within a catchment area. In the cancer care model, this requires that any physician encountering a patient they suspect of having a malignancy have access to a system that ensures rapid, accurate, and reliable pathology for primary diagnosis of cancer. Sub Saharan Africa faces immense challenges in providing adequate coverage and each region, country, and district with unique obstacles to overcome when meeting the health needs of the population. Method: The American Society of Clinical Pathology (ASCP), in partnership with the White House Office of Science Technology Policy and the Clinton Global Initiative, recently launched a 26.5 million dollar multi-year initiative which begins with assessment of potential countries with the greatest need-including collaboration and capacity program building with local officials and staff-to deploy full service pathology infrastructure for eligible countries to strategically to meet their population needs. Results: Working in parallel and together, Steering Committees for Diagnostics and Technology, Care and Treatment, In-Country Medical Education, Bioethics, and Monitoring & Evaluation have focused on each potential country to optimize success. The maximal intervention includes deployment of automated histopathology systems and integrated whole slide imaging systems linked through a customized laboratory information system to a dedicated team of pathologists from the United States. Conclusion: This long-term project will roll out to 10 or more countries in Africa as well as Haiti. An overview of the project will be presented as well as experiences data from countries launched to date.E-PS-12-005 Immunohistochemistry and special stains automated instrument interfaces J. M. Tuthill * * Henry Ford Health System, Pathology, Detroit, USA Objective: To implement an interface between the anatomic pathology LIS and automated immunohistochemistry and special stain instruments. Method: We partnered with our vendors, Sunquest Information Systems and Dako, to implement a bi-directional HL7 interface between our AP-LIS, (Sunquest CoPath) and our automated immunohistochemistry (IHC) and special staining platforms, eliminating dual order entry and associated errors while improving workflow efficiency and capacity. Results: System implementation resulted in direct time savings of 575.7 Hrs/YR for IHC staining automation and 118.2 Hrs/YR for special stains increasing capacity and efficiency in histology. Transposition, slide relabeling and run time errors were eliminated improving patient safety and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: The impact this project was the simplification of the workflow and run setup process, as orders were seamlessly transferred electronically between the AP-LIS and the IHC and special stain autostainer instruments. The implementation of unique ID technology and the HL7 interface has greatly reduced patient mis-identification. By eliminating slide relabeling from the process, we have further automated the workflow, which has resulted in the savings of hundreds of hours of labor. The histology lab is now able to better allocate resources, while at the same time, increasing efficiency and capacity.E-PS-13-001 Lipid histiocytosis of the gallbladder neck lymph node and obesity A. Handra-Luca * , M. Ben Romdhane, B. Straub * APHP University Paris Nord, GHU Avice, Dept. of Pathology, Bobigny, FranceObjective: The objectives of this study were to report the features of lipid histiocytosis of the gallbladder neck lymph node. Such lesions are rarely reported nowadays. Method: Two cases diagnosed with gallbladder neck lymph node lipid histiocytosis were analysed for clinical, morphological and immunohistochemical features. Results: The two obese patients presented with gallbladder lithiasis detected on CT-scan. The treatment consisted in coelioscopic cholecystectomy. Microscopy revealed subacute/chronic lithiasic cholecystitis and foci of vacuolated cells in the gallbladder neck lymph node. These cells were positive for CD68, CD31, S100-protein, adipophilin and TIP47; negative for cytokeratin and Alcian blue. Conclusion: In conclusion, we report lymph node lipid histiocytosis diagnosed microscopically after cholecystectomy. While such lesions may remain unidentified on imaging procedures, the microscopic analysis may require special stains and immunohistochemistries for ruling out adenocarcinoma metastasis. Objective: Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) represents 0.02 % of primary hepatic neoplasms in children. Here we present a case of an FNH from a 2 year-old male, review its epidemiology, pathophysiology, definitive histologic features, treatment and prognosis. Ultimately, we aim to raise awareness of a rare benign lesions in an age group where a primary liver mass usually represents a malignant tumour. Method: Herein we describe the case of a 2 year-old male who presented with a year-long history of an abdominal mass, atypical radiologic findings and normal alphafeto protein levels. Results: The tumour was thought to be a hepatoblastoma and was excised. Histopathological examination demonstrated focal nodular hyperplasia. The patient was discharged well after surgery. Conclusion: Recognition of benign primary liver lesions in the pediatric age group where malignant tumours are more frequently seen is essential because prognosis and treatment greatly differs.E-PS-13-004 Acrometastasis as the initial presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma A. U. Kiriwandeniya * , T. Wijerathne * University of Sjayawardenepura, Dept. of Pathology, Colombo, Sri LankaObjective: Acrometastasis occur infrequently, accounting for approximately 0.1 % of all metastatic osseous involvement. Its presentation mimics infectious or inflammatory disease. Primary manifestation of HCC as acrometastasis is extremely rare. Method: Case report: A 59 years old alcoholic male was admitted with sudden onset profuse bleeding from an ulcer involving middle and proximal phalanx of left middle finger. According to the patient this was a chronic wound following a road traffic accident. Patient underwent amputation of this finger for the clinical diagnosis of chronic osteomylitis. Macroscopy showed a continuous lesion from skin to bone with evidence of bone destruction. Microscopy together with immunohistochemistry (HepPar 1 antibody) confirmed a deposit of a HCC with skin and bone infiltration. Follow up radiological investigations revealed two foci of hepatocellular carcinoma with background cirrhosis. Results: Discussion: HCC show a haematogenous spread usually via pulmonary circulation and vertebral circulation. Hence the mechanism of spread into bones other than the bones of the axial skeleton, bypassing the lung is not explained. Amputation, radiation, excision, and systemic Objective: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) accounts for about 20 % of biopsies performed for glomerular disease in Poland. Activation of complement plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IgAN. Recent data revealed the ability of polymeric IgA to activate the lectin pathway. Mesangial deposition of C4d is considered to be a consequence of lectin pathway activation. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical presentation, laboratory data, and histological lesions in renal biopsy in IgAN patients with positive and negative staining for mesangial C4d. Method: Material consists of kidney biopsies obtained from 43 adult patients who underwent a renal biopsy between 2010 and 2015, and were diagnosed in Department of Nephropathology, Medical University of Lodz. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data at the time of presentation were collected. The renal biopsy specimens were routinely processed by light microscopy and immunofluorescence. C4d in glomeruli was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. Histological lesions were classified using Oxford pathologic classification criteria. Statistical analysis were performed to assess the differences in clinical presentation, laboratory data and the renal damage between C4d (+) and C4d (\u2212) groups of IgAN. Results: Of 43 patients with IgAN, 11 were classified as C4d positive, and 32 as C4d negative. Hypertension, severe proteinuria, high level of serum creatinine, low eGFR at the time of presentation, as well as tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis >50 %, and endocapillary proliferation were significantly more frequent in C4d (+) group than in C4d (\u2212) group. Conclusion: C4d positive mesangial staining in IgAN is associated with more severe clinical course of the disease and more severe renal damage. Results: Among clinical factors, the proportion of patients with a high body mass index (>25 kg/m2) was significantly higher in DN patients than in non-DN patients. The prevalences of coronary heart disease, smoking, and hepatitis B and C viral infections; degrees of HLA mismatches; donor age and gender; and type of immunosuppression were not different between the two groups. Laboratory features showed lower serum albumin and creatinine levels in DN patients than in non-DN patients. Renal allograft histology showed increased percentages of global glomerulosclerosis and higher degrees of mesangial matrix increase, interstitial fibrosis, arteriolar hyalinosis, and arteriosclerosis yet lower \"ptc\" scores in DN patients than those in non-DN patients. Objective: The aim of this study is two-fold; first to investigate the importance of proteinuria in the determination of renal pathology in donors, and second to find out the importance of renal biopsy in the selection of donor for transplantation. Method: Among 679 donors only 70 showed proteinuria. Serial 24-h urine protein and microalbumin examined, and all of them underwent renal biopsy. Renal biopsies examined by light, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Results: The mean 24-h urine protein found 438 \u00b1 302 mg/day in 70 cases. Among 70 cases with proteinuria, only 21 (30 %) had a chance to become a donor after biopsy (Group 1). Biopsy findings of these 21 cases were nonspecific. In group 2, the biopsy diagnosis was FSGS in 17, IgA nephropathy in 8, MPGN in 4, IgM nephropathy in 3, and TIN in 2, hypertensive nephropathy in 2, MGN in 1, MCD in 1, lupus nephritis in 1 and nonspecific biopsy findings in 10 cases. A significant difference found between group 1 (284,8 \u00b1 114 mg/day) and group 2 (503 \u00b1 333 mg/day) in regards of 24-h urine protein (p < 0.01). In addition significant differences was noted between group 1 (34,2 \u00b1 59,2 mg/day) and group 2 (143 \u00b1 275,4 mg/dl) in regards of 24-h urine microalbumin (p < 0.01). Only 16 patients from group 2 also showed microscopic hematuria in addition to proteinuria. Conclusion: We suggested that proteinuria greater than 300 mg was a marker of renal disease. We concluded that microalbuminuria determination may be a more reliable marker of renal disease, and the presence of microalbuminuria should preclude donation. Objective: We aimed to study the ultrastructural (US) findings and capillary HLA-DR expression in 52 renal allografts with acute humoral (AHR), acute vascular (AVR), acute tubulointerstitial (ATR) and chronic humoral rejection (CHR) and correlate these findings with the development of transplant glomerulopathy (TG). Method: ATR, AVR, AHR, and CHR were found in 12 (23 %), 12 (23 %), 14 (27 %) and 14 (27 %) patients, respectively. Peritubular capillary DR (PTC-DR) and glomerular DR (GDR) expression evaluated. The lower intensity of PTC-DR was considered to indicate more extensive PTC destruction. Results: US changes including capillary endothelial swelling and multilamellation, subendothelial widening and GBM duplication found to be highest in biopsies with AHR compared to biopsies with ATR and AVR (p < 0.001). The loss of PTC-DR expression, therefore, the destruction of PTC was found highest in biopsies with AHR and CHR compared to biopsies ATR and ACR. TG was developed 8,3 %, 33,3 % and 57,1 % in patients with ATR, AVR and AHR respectively (p = 0,01). The development of TG was 45,5 \u00b1 9,2 months in ATR cases, 20,7 \u00b1 8 months in AVR cases and 7,2 \u00b1 3 in AHR cases. Capillary endothelial swelling, subendothelial widening, multilamellation, and GBM duplication showed a great impact on the development of TG. The risk of TG development -Thursday, 29 September 2016 .3 E-PS-15 Nephropathology Conclusion: To our knowledge, statistical data regarding renal pathology is scarce throughout. This is one of the largest series of a single hospital in the literature and the first in our country.",

Kini, D. P. * St Johns Medical College, Dept. of Pathology, Bangalore, IndiaObjective: Search for a cause for Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) is crucial to determine its treatment and management. Primary MGN was a diagnosis of exclusion until the discovery of target antigen, PLA2R. Lack of published data from Indian population prompted this prospective study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies in MGN patients by using cell based indirect i m m u n o f l u o r e s c e n c e t e s t ( I I F T ) a n d c o r r e l a t i n g w i t h clinicohistopathology and response to treatment. Method: MGN cases (n = 34) diagnosed by renal biopsy and IIFT were evaluated for serum PLA2R using IIFT on biochip containing HEK 293 cell lines transfected with cDNA coded for PLA2R and also investigated for causes for MGN. Positive cases were followed up for a period of 6 months of treatment with a repeat testing. Results: PLA2R positive MGN cases (n = 14) had higher 24 h proteinuria (10 \u00b1 2.46 g) with BM thickening vs 7 \u00b1 3.8 g proteinuria in secondary MGN additionally showing mesangial hypercellularity and endocapillary proliferation. Clinical profile of both groups was same. Sensitivity and specificity were 70 and 100 %; 8 complete remission; 2 partial and 2 no response. Remission was less in PLA2R group. Conclusion: Anti-PLA2R in serum is a good reliable biomarker for primary MGN and for monitoring its disease activity. Objective: Although some degree of physiological changes develop in kidney function or pre-existing renal disease can be exacerbated, some women develop renal disease during the course of the pregnancy. We describe here renal biopsy data of our pregnant patients presenting with renal disease. Method: We retrospectively searched for the kidney biopsies performed in pregnant women in our hospital database. Results: We re-evaluated kidney biopsies of 17 pregnant women with mean age of 29.5 years. Mean gestational age at which biopsy has been performed was 13.8 weeks. Biopsy diagnoses were focal segmental glomerular sclerosis in 8 (47 %) cases (one of them is perihilar type), preeclampsia in 6 (35.2 %) cases, thrombotic microangiopathy in 1 (5 %) case, IgA nephropathy with preeclampsia in 1 (5 %) case and mesangial proliferation in 1 (5 %) case. One patient had twin pregnancy and one patient had systemic lupus erythematosus before pregnancy. Two patients had undergone therapeutic curettage in their 9th weeks of gestation and one patient has lost her baby in 25th weeks of gestation. Conclusion: Kidney biopsy may be a difficult procedure during pregnancy, however it offers the opportunity to make a correct diagnosis, with which timely management are crucial to improve outcomes. Objective: Structured pathology reports might be as useful for renal biopsy reporting as they have been for reporting cancer resection specimen. For efficient reuse in quality control, registries and research, structured reports should consist of structured data, not just structured text. Here we present a method to generate and maintain a data set for renal biopsy reporting. Method: The openEHR specification and archetype editor were used to create the information model. The information model is managed and further developed in the multilingual open knowledge platform http://arketyper.no/ckm/en. Results: The information model for structured renal biopsy reporting consists both of structured data and free text elements. Typical data elements are e.g. number of glomeruli (numeric) and grade of arteriosclerosis (list of internal codes). Knowledge support based on international consensus is provided for each data element allowing for consistent data input. The model is intended to be a maximum data set, which can be adapted for use in individual pathology departments. The data structure can be implemented in pathology information systems. Data can be transferred to registries using electronic communication standards in healthcare.Conclusion: The information model is accessible in the open knowledge p l a t f o r m h t t p : / / a r k e t y p e r. n o / c k m / e n ( h t t p : / / a r k e t y p e r. no/ckm/en/#showArchetype_1078.36.547) and will be optimized by a thorough collaborative review process. Objective: Meningiomas stem from arachnoid cap cells, the so-called meningiothelial cells. According to their histopathological features meningiomas are classified either as WHO grade I (the meningiothelial, fibrous / fibroblastic, transitional / mixed, psammomatous, angiomatous, microcystic, secretory and the lympholasmacyterich subtype), grade II (the atypical and the clear cell subtype) or grade III (malignant or anaplastic phenotype). Method: We report on a case of a 62-year old female patient who was referred to hospital because of progressive obliviousness and concentration difficulties. Results: An occipital convexity-meningioma was diagnosed and subsequently resected. Within the tumour tissue there were multiple spheroid precipitates, i.e. secretion products that turned out to consist of collagen. Part of the tumour cells displayed positive reactions for vasogenic substances, namely for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Correspondingly, the diagnosis \"WHO Grade I Collagen Forming Meningioma\" seemed to be most appropriate.",

            "text": "The \"WHO grade I collagen forming meningioma\" we report on produces collagen and angiogenic substances. To the best of our knowledge, no such entity has been reported on in previous literature. We propose this collagen producing meningioma as a novel WHO grade I meningioma subtype. Results: Histological examination showed a hypervascular tumour consisted by interwoven fascicles of spindle to epithelioid cells with an oncocytic granular cytoplasm. Immunophenotypically the neoplasm was positive for S100, Galectin-3, Vimentin, EMA, Annexin-A1 and TTF-1, while it was characteristically negative for GFAP, Chromogranin, Synaptophysin, CD68, TFE-3, IDH1R132H and CD34. SDHB, ATRX and INI1 expressions were retained. Ki-67 index was 10 %. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of spindle-cell oncocytoma from pituicytoma is difficult and relies upon clinicopathological criteria and even ultrastractural studies to reveal the abundant mitochondria and the junctional complexes at the cell borders. Recently, some authors propose that SCO is a variant of pituicytoma. Objective: Menengiom is the most common intracranial tumour. It is a benign neoplasm which arises from the arachnoid cap cells of the cerebrum and the spinal cord. Method: Angiomatous meningioma(AM) is a rare histological subtype of meningioma, constituting %2.1 of all meningiomas. Histologically, its blood vessel component exceeds %50 of total tumour area. AM is reported in two types which are microvascular and macrovascular. AM also demonstrates some distinct features compared to other benign meningiomas, such as it seems that male female ratio for AM is higher than that for general meningioma. Results: We report a clinical case of a 77 year old woman with ang\u0131omatous men\u0131ng\u0131oma in the cerebrum which was suspected for hemangioblastoma by radiologists. Objective: Extracraneal non-dural or ectopic meningiomas are very rare, but their similitude to their intracranial more common counterpart in terms of histologic and immunophenotypic features, usually allows an accurate differential diagnosis with other headand-neck lesions. Method: We report the case of a 70-year-old woman presenting with a slow growing frontal subcutaneous mass, static on palpation, progressing for 6 years. Computed tomographic scan described an extracraneal soft tissue mass, contiguous with the external aspect of the cortical of the frontal bone, causing superficial erosion and sclerotic reaction. The patient underwent tumour resection. Results: Surgical specimen was a flat 3,5 \u00d7 2,3 \u00d7 0,7 cm fragment of tan-yellow tissue comprising bone splinters. Histologic analysis showed a neoplastic lesion, composed of epithelioid and fusiform cells, with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm of syncytial appearance, round to oval uniform nuclei with delicate chromatin and occasional small solitary nucleoli. The cells formed occasional whorls and were disposed in a collagenous background. No necrosis or mitotic activity were identified. Tumour cells showed immunoreactivity to epithelial membrane antigen, S100 protein and progesterone receptors. Final diagnosis was of a grade I extracraneal fibrous meningioma.Conclusion: This case illustrates the characteristics of these rare extracraneal lesions. In cases such as this, an intracaneal component must always be excluded.",

Caparovski * UKIM -Skopje, Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Republic of Macedonia Objective: Lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma is a very rare subtype of benign meningioma, which is characterized by prominent inflammatory cell infiltration with sparse meningothelial component. The incidence is less than 1 % of all meningiomas. We present a case of 45-year-old male without any systemic hematologic abnormalities. Method: The patient was admitted at the Neurosurgery Clinic with headache, confusion, disorientation, nausea and vomiting. Neurological examination and complete blood count were normal. The MRI revealed isodense, contrast-enhanced dural mass in the right frontal parasagital region. Total tumourectomy was done and gross examination showed oval, well-circumsribed tumour with diameter of 4 cm. Results: Microscopic analysis showed neoplasm composed of rare nests of meningothelial cells surrounded by extensive lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrate, separated by proliferated colagenous connective tissue bands. The meningothelial cells had round to o v a l n u c l e i w i t h o u t c l e a r c y t o p l a s m i c b o r d e r s . Immunohistochemistry showed positive signal for EMA, PR, CD3, CD4, CD20, LCA, CD79alfa and Bcl2; focal positive signal for CD138, IgA, IgD, IgG, IgM, \u03bb, k and negative signal for CD34, CD10,CD23.

Saygin * Karadeniz Technical University, Pathology, Trabzon, TurkeyObjective: Meningioma is a neoplasm derived from meningothelial cells representing various histopathological features. Metaplastic meningioma is one of the rarest subtypes. Metaplastic meningioma exhibiting extensive xanthomatous changes, namely 'xanthomatous meningioma', is an extremely rare variant of meningioma. Method: The surgical specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded. The section were stained with routinary H&E. Immunohistochemistry was performed. Results: A 32-year-old male patient presented to outpatient clinic with dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass lesion with 7,4 cm diameter in the right frontal area. Total resection of the tumour was performed. Microscopically, the tumour composed of two components. The conventional meningioma component showed polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei. The xanthomatous component was composed of tumour cells with vacuolated clear cytoplasm and round nuclei. Immunohistochemically, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), Vimentin and Progesterone were expressed in both the conventional meningioma and the xanthomatous component. CD68 was expressed only in the xanthomatous component.Those xanthomatous cells had been considered as neoplastic meningothelial cells, but not macrophages, because of being positive for EMA. This case was diagnosed as xanthomatous meningioma, WHO grade 1. Conclusion: It is important to pathologists not to misidentify xanthomatous tumour cells as macrophages.E-PS- [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Posterior fossa tuberculoma in a 9-year old boy mimicking posterior fossa tumour T. Pasupati Meenakshi * * Clinipath Pathology, Histopathology, Puchong, MalaysiaObjective: Posterior fossa tuberculoma in young children without classical symptoms of fever or lethargy can initially present with neurological symptoms and mimic a tumour, both clinically and on imaging studies. A diagnosis of tuberculoma can be missed without proper history and clinical work up. Method: A 9-year old boy presented with repeated episodes of headache of 1 month duration and unsteady gait for 1 week. CT scan and MRI showed a space occupying lesion in the posterior fossa and a malignant posterior fossa tumour was considered. A right suboccipital paramedian craniotomy and tumour excision was done. Specimen received was soft, grayish white to pale yellow, measuring in aggregate 42 mm. Entire tissue was analyzed. Results: Histology exhibited extensive areas of caseative necrosis, surrounded by epithelioid cells, numerous Langhans giant cells, lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells. Focal areas of microgranulomas with surrounding reactive gliosis was noted. No Cryptococci or fungal element was discernible. Post operatively, a very high ESR and history of direct contact with his father, a patient treated for pulmonary tuberculosis was confirmed. Conclusion: Intracranial tuberculomas are often mistaken as tumours in neuroimaging studies and not detected in early stages. The importance of clinical history and other ancillary investigations is reemphasized. Objective: A case of intermediate grade melanocytoma of the brain in a 42year-old woman is presented. Primary melanocytic tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) are classified as well differentiated melanocytoma and malign melanoma. This case has been considered worth presenting as it is in the quadrigeminal cistern, it is invasive and it is rare. Method: The surgical specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded. The sections were stained with routinary H&E. Immunohistochemistry was performed. Results: Histological examination revealed the tumour to be composed of cells which have oval shaped to fusiform nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm. There were concentrated melanin pigments in some areas. Also brain invasion was detected. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for Vimentin, HMB45, Tyrosinase and focally positive for S100, MelanA and KBA62. Ki67 index was found as % 0-1. Conclusion: Primary melanocytic tumours of CNS arise from melanocytic cells in leptomeninx. They are usually seen as noninvasive masses. It is important to distinguish it from meningiomas and melanotic schwannomas. Neoplasm which has minimal atipia and brain invasion or increased mytotic activity is defined as intermediate grade. It is foreseen that it will behave more agressively.",

            "text": "Are we pathologists reducing ourselves to replaceable technicians? L. Nichols * * Mercer University, School of Medicine, Dept. of Pathology, Macon, USA Objective: To show how the ever increasing need to use immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and molecular diagnostic testing risks making pathologists mere technicians who render tissue diagnoses and to present some potential remedies. Results: As an example, years ago, a lung biopsy showing adenocarcinoma would be signed out using only routine hematoxylin & eosin staining, but now increasingly requires immunostaining to confirm that it is lung primary and molecular testing for mutations conferring sensitivity to targeted therapy. Pathologists can make themselves less replaceable if they bring their diagnoses to direct encounters with patients (as a team member), decision-making conferences (such as tumour boards), policymaking meetings (like patient safety committees), clinicopathologic conferences, radiologic conferences and clinical case-based teaching in medical education. As an example, pathologists are in a unique position among medical educators to expertly edit a case presentation of lung primary adenocarcinoma to teach how the signs and symptoms relate to the radiology, microscopic pathology, treatment and prognosis. Conclusion: Instead of withdrawing into roles of nothing more than back-room morphologist diagnosticians, pathologists can find ways of integrating their diagnoses and knowledge of pathology into patient care and medical education, ways that utilize their knowledge as physicians. Objective: Splenic hamartoma is a rare tumour with incidence <1 % in autopsies. We present a case of a splenic hamartoma in a 56-year-old woman. Conclusion: Amyloid deposits could be evaluated by using Congored, crystal violet or toluidine blue stains. Congo red stain is the most used method but it needs technical and laboratory experiences. Thioflavin-t or Congo-red stains under ultraviyolet light could more be helpful and sensitive. However limited number of patients was included this study, thioflavin-t staining could be an alternative or additional method for Congo-red staining in cutaneous amyloidosis. Objective: We illustrate an autopsy case in which the diagnosis of fat embolism was made with exclusive focus on standard staining (Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining) of pulmonary sampling. Method: We present a case of 60 year-old female who was a victim of a traffic accident which caused a tibial closed fracture. She He was hospitalized and scheduled for a surgical operation. Clinical deterioration occurred, followed by rapid death. Results: The external examination and the autopsy showed no specific asphyxia syndrome without any particular finding except cardiac hypertrophy. A histological examination with standard staining has been performed showed the presence of embolic fat droplets in some alveolar capillaries with a total narrowing of the vascular lumen. Conclusion: The histological examination with H&E staining can be conclusive in case of postmortem diagnosis of fat embolism. The pulmonary sampling in such case must be exhaustive. The pathologist must be warned thus he will pay particular intention in order to find fat droplets in the capillary lumen. Objective: We report the autopsy findings and the histological features of two autopsy cases, in which tumour pituitary lesions lead to sudden death. Method: Report of two cases. Results: First observation: A 41-year-old woman presented a sudden agitation. She dead almost 30 min after. Macroscopic autopsy findings included a heavy edematous brain associated to a large tumour arising from the sella turcica associated to a hypertrophy of the pituitary gland. Microscopic examination revealed a pituitary adenoma and an intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of the cavernous sinus known else as Masson's tumour. Second observation: A 52-year-old man with a history of head ache treated symptomatically. He presented a sudden loss of consciousness and he dead few minutes after. The macroscopic findings of the autopsy included essentially heavy edematous brain with a pressure cone of the cerebellar tonsils. Also we noticed a large tumour (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2cm) associated to a pink-grey hypertrophy of the pituitary gland. Microscopic examination showed homogenous pituitary hyperplasia. Conclusion: These two cases highlight the need for a thorough postmortem investigation, including a microscopic examination of the pituitary gland. Objective: Gaucher disease is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder in which an enzymatic deficiency causes an accumulation of harmful quantities of certain fats. It is not described as a cause of sudden death. Method: Here, we report a case of a 33 year-old-female with a medical history of valvular stenosis died suddenly in suspected circumstances. Results: The external examination revealed brownish, reddish, yellow, and green subcutaneous hemorrhages on the torso as well as the upper and lower extremities. The autopsy showed a sclerosis and calcification of the left cardiac valve associated with an abnormally enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) with a hypertrophy of the lymph nodes. A histological examination was performed showed Gaucher's cell in the splenic, hepatic and lymph node tissue. Unfortunately, the bone marrow was not collected. Conclusion: By this observation we underline the important role of histology in solving some critical problem and the value of routinely collecting bone marrow during an autopsy to enable accurate testing and diagnosis. Objective: We report two cases of sudden unexpected death due to undiagnosed glioblastoma with special focus on the histological features. Method: We report two cases. Results: First observation: A 42-year-old woman was found dead in her house, in advancing degree of putrefaction. A medicolegal autopsy was performed showing essentially a gray discoloration of the brain with partial liquefied parenchyma. Also, a varicolored brain tumour of the right frontoparietal region was identified. It contained regions of necrosis and hemorrhage, extended to the skull bone. Histologically, although the brain parenchyma was adversely affected by the autolytic artifact, we noticed a tumourous tissue composed of mostly poorly differentiated pleomorphic astrocytic cells associated to an important degree of nuclear atypia and a large zone of necrosis. Second observation: A 64-year-old man suddenly collapsed in prison and dead some minutes after. A medicolegal autopsy was required. Pathological findings showed a heavy weighed brain. At coronal sections, the cerebral hemispheres were asymmetrical with deviation of midline structures from right toward left. In the right fronto-parieto-temporal region we noticed an enlarged spherical mass (cm 14 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5), with variegated appearance. Histologically, a small-cell astrocytic neoplasm with focal gigantocellular differentiation featuring necroses was described and a diagnosis of a glioblastoma was retained. Conclusion: In cases with sudden death with suspected intracranial pathology the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach, including the forensic medicine and the pathologist is compulsory. Objective: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a form of large vessel granulomatous vasculitis, mainly affects the aorta and its branches in different ways. We illustrate an exceptional case of sudden death due to TA diagnosed on the basis of histologic features. Method: We report a case of a 19-year old girl suddenly collapsed at home and died few minutes after. Results: In autopsy, we find a significant circumferential narrowing of the aorta and the major branches notably the carotid artery with a major symmetric hypertrophy of the heart associated to a moderate left ventricular dilatation. A histological examination was performed that confirms the myocardial hypertrophy and the massive pulmonary edema. Moreover, it specifies that this parietal vessel infiltration is panarteritis due to TA. To our knowledge, this is the first described report of such complication of TA which occurs as a sudden death with such mechanism. Conclusion: By our case we underline that autopsy must be completed and the aorta and the branches have to be dissected and explored very thoroughly. And finally, we emphasize the important role of autopsy in explaining such threatening mechanism of some rare disease. Objective: It is already known that increase of intra-abdominal pressure has a negative effect on the function of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiovascular ans urinary tracts. Our purpose was to research the influence of intra-abdominal on the brain. Method: The experimental research: male rats of the same age, weight, diet (n = 100). Among them: a control group (n = 10)-intact animals without affecting; comparison group (n = 90)-animals, which was artificially created by intraabdominal hypertension of different degrees (15, 25, 35 mm Hg) and different exposure times (3, 12, 24 h). The method of creation of intra-abdominal hypertension-pneumoperitoneum. We made the morphological examination of the brain tissue. Results: We got the next results: 15 mm Hg-only pericellular swell, the general structure of the brain and cerebellum are kept; 25 mm Hg-capillarstasis, perivascular swell, plethora, gliosis of t h e b r a i n t i s s u e ; 3 5 m m H ge x t e n s i v e z o n e s o f encephalomalacia, gliosis of the brain tissue, hemorrhages, brain depression. These changes amplified at increase in an exposition of intra-abdominal hypertension. Conclusion: The degree of changes of the brain tissue depends on the level and time of the intra-abdominal hypertension. Objective: Caroli syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree and congenital hepatic fibrosis. It occurs in more than 60 % of the individuals with autosomal polycystic kidney disease and appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner due to a mutation of the PKHD1 gene, which is also linked to ARPKD. It has an average incidence of less than 1 case per 100,000 people, with more reported cases of Caroli syndrome than of Caroli disease. Method: We report the case of a late preterm female infant diagnosed with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and no family history of renal disorders. At gross examination we observed markedly enlarged kidneys with bosselated surface, occupying most of the abdominal cavity and containing multiple small cysts in the renal cortex and medulla. Results: Microscopic evaluation showed radially arranged, elongated cysts, lined by cuboidal or flattened epithelium and surrounded by interstitial fibrosis. Microscopic evaluation of the liver revealed unusually numerous, irregular and dilated intrahepatic bile ducts accompanied by congenital hepatic fibrosis, highly suggestive for Caroli syndrome. Conclusion: Although extremely rare, Caroli syndrome should be taken into consideration as differential diagnosis in neonates with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary tree or congenital hepatic fibrosis. We emphasize the importance of high resolution ultrasonography as primary imagistic modality for evaluation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, especially during the perinatal and neonatal periods. Objective: Hydranencephaly (HA) is a rare congenital condition of unknown etiology, in which cerebral hemispheres are absent and neonatal skull can be transilluminated. Method: Routine USG examination was performed at the 13th and 23rd weeks of gestation. Autopsy of the neonate after termination of pregnancy was performed using routine procedures enriched with transillumination of the skull using a bright light source. Results: First USG examination showed normal brain. Although the next USG scan revealed the pattern of empty fetal skull, this was overlooked. Objective: Patau syndrome was first described in 1960 as a group of birth defects caused by trisomy of chromosome 13. The estimated incidence of trisomy 13 at the time of delivery was calculated as 1.6 per 10,000 deliveries. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by impaired cortisol synthesis. The incidence ranges from 1:10000 to 1:20000 births and is more prevalent in some ethnic groups, particularly in remote geographic regions. Approximately 95 % of all congenital adrenal hyperplasia cases are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene, on chromosome 7, prevalence is 1:2500 newborn infants. Method: The case of a 1-month-old girl with of trisomy 13, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21-hydroxylase deficiency) and cystic fibrosis. Results: We find syndactyly, polydactyly, gnathoschisis, hypoplasia of the aortic tract, bicorporeal septate uterus. Histology the presence of adrenal hyperplasia. The pancreas showed extensive fibrosis, acinar destruction and dilatation of ducts. The typical acidophil content in the secretory ducts and acini of the pancreas was confirmed. Conclusion: Thus, this case demonstrates of Patau syndrome combined with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and cystic fibrosis. Objective: Swyer syndrome is a rare manifestation of disturbances of gonadal and sex development in which the individual has 46,XY genotype but is phenotypically a girl. Method: We present a case of 11-year-old girl, admitted to hospital with complaints of lower abdominal pain, anorexia and subfebrile temperature. Ultrasonography revealed a large tumour of the right ovary. By laboratory investigations, the alpha-fetoprotein level in serum was 15,954 IU/ml (laboratory reference range, 0-4.6). The chromosome analysis revealed 46,XY karyotype. The patient underwent lower laparotomy and right adnexectomy. Results: Grossly, the tumour (17 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 8 cm) was nodular, grayish-white. It had cystic areas. Histological examination revealed a mixed germ cell tumour with the reticular pattern, characteristic of yolk sac tumour. Alveolar, glandular and trabecular architecture was present. By immunohistochemistry, alpha-fetoprotein and CD117 were expressed. There were regions composed of primitive mesenchyma enclosing cysts lined by cytokeratin AE1/AE3-positive respiratory epithelium. Areas containing immature lipocytes, hyaline cartilage and ossification were also found. Prophylactic left adnexectomy was performed. The histopathological examination showed the typical features of gonadoblastoma: cells with inconspicuous cytoplasm and small round-to-oval nuclei, surrounded by ovarian-type stroma. Conclusion: Swyer syndrome is associated with a significant risk of developing different germ cell tumours including teratomas. Prophylactic gonadectomy is recommended.",

            "text": "The case report of pleomorphic anaplastic neuroblastoma with unique evaluation of carbon isotopic composition in tumour tissue J. Kobos * , K. Taran Objective: Pleomorphic anaplastic neuroblastoma (PAN) was described for the first time as an aggressive histological type characterized clinically by advanced stage of disease with abdominal dissemination and poor response to treatment [1] . Rarity of this entity together with its unusual biology may render PAN diagnostically challenging. Method: The patient was 3-years old boy presented with pathological mass originating from right suprarenal gland with tumour dissemination in abdominal cavity and bone marrow infiltration accompanied by elevated concentrations of catecholamines and their metabolites in the urine. The isotope ratio measurement in frozen tumour tissue, performed with the use of Sercon 20-22 Continuous Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (CF-IRMS) coupled with Sercon SL elemental analyzer for simultaneous carbon-nitrogen-sulfur (NCS). Results: In microscopic examination of tumour tissue pleomorphic and anaplastic cells were fund as well as necrosis and microcalcifications. Immunophenotype of tumour cells appeared not clear. Neuron-specific enolase and Protein Gene Product 9.5 were positive, neuroblastoma 84 marker was found in single tumour cells only. Myogenic differentiation protein presence and myogenin cytoplasmatic reaction were also observed. Proliferation Ki-67 index was 60 %. The isotope ratio measurement in frozen tumour tissue have revealed the following results: the stable carbon isotopes ratio 13C/12C (\u03b413C) was \u221227.25 \u2030. Conclusion: Stable isotope ratio measurement is an unique procedure in oncology. The method meets the highest requirements concerning measurement quality and credibility. Striking low values of carbon stable isotope ratios in PAN tissue in presented case may also be related to its aggressive clinical behavior in presented case and helpful in individual patients' treatment consideration. Objective: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a sporadic non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, first described as \"lipoid granulomatosis\" by Jakob Erdheim and William Chester in 1930. It is a very rare disease that typically affects middle-aged patients and has a significant male predominance. In paediatric age is extremely rare. Method: We report a case 4-years-old child that presents extensive lesion in the base of the skull, with destructive behaviour of osteolytic type and tissue component, with associated diabetes insipidus-clinical suspicion of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Results: Histopathological evaluation of biopsies revealed infiltrating lesion by histiocytes with a foamy cytoplasm, with positive staining for CD68 and negative for CD1a, Langerin and S100 protein. Genetic study confirmed BRAF V600E mutation, and patient began therapeutic with dabrafenib. Conclusion: ECD is a very rare disease, especially in paediatric age, and it is associated with high mortality rates. BRAF V600E mutation was recently described in about 50 % of patients with ECD which lead to worldwide therapeutics with BRAF inhibitors, that proved to be very beneficial with increase in survival rates. Objective: Melanotic neuroectodermal tumour of infancy (MNTI) is an extremely rare, pigmented neoplastic entity of neural crest origin. More than 90 % of these tumours occur in the head and neck region, especially the maxilla, during the first year of life. However its presentation since birth and intracranial extension is more exceptional. Method: We report the case of a 1-month-old girl who presented a cranial swelling since birth rapidly growing. Radiologic investigations showed a richly vascularized mass with extra and intracranial extension. Those clinical and radiologic findings were suggestive of juvenile hemangioma. The child underwent complete surgical excision. Results: Histopathological examination revealed the tumour consisted of the two cell components. The first type was small round cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio consistent with neuroblastic cells. The second type was large polyhedral cells containing melanin. The Ki67 index was 90 %. No adjuvant treatment was proposed after surgery. Conclusion: MNTI is considered to be a benign tumour with good prognosis and rarely behaves as a malignant the clinical behavior of this tumours may be distinguished by the pathological findings. Objective: Infantile digital fibromatosis (IDF) is an uncommon benign proliferation of myofibroblasts in the dermal tissue on the digits and toes with a marked tendency for recurrence. The tumour may often resolve spontaneously. We discuss through this case report clinicopathological features of this tumour. Method: We report a 2-year-old girl without notable medical history, who presented three firms nodular lesions of the 4th and 5th fingers of the left hand appearing since 3 months.",

Microscopically, the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue contained a benign proliferation made of non atypical myofibroblasts with a fascicular pattern. The tumour cells were placed on a hyaline collagen matrix highly vascularized. The trichromatic Masson staining revealed many inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of neoplastic fibroblasts. Conclusion: The IDF is a rare benign tumour of childhood, characterized by a good prognosis. Despite the spontaneous regression reported in the literature, surgical excision is the best treatment for these tumours. Objective: Neuroblastoma is the commonest solid tumour of childhood derived from neural crest ectoderm that occur either in the adrenal gland or associated sympathetic ganglia. Here, we presented an unusual presentation of neuroblastoma arising from the sympathetic chain. Method: We reported an autopsy case of abdominopelvic neuroblastoma occurring in a 37-week-old newborn male who died on the second day because of cardio-respiratory failure.Results: The complete autopsy demonstrated moderate ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions, congested and oedematous lungs, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and a globular tumour in the abdominopelvic region compressing the left kidney which showed a pyelo-calyceal hydronephrosis. The tumour was well-circumscribed with smooth external surface, had a firm consistency, and measured 8 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 cm. On cut section, the tumour appeared heterogeneous with peripheral focal hemorrhagic areas. On microscopic analysis, the tumour was composed of lobules of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. Rare mitotic figures were observed. At few places, the tumour showed neuropil and schwannian stroma. On the basis of these findings, diagnosis of poorly differentiated neuroblastoma was considered. Conclusion: The presented case highlights the significance of detailed histological analysis in neonatal neuroblastomas with unusual presentation. Objective: The Currarino triad is a relatively unknown hereditary disorder, composed of an association of a congenital anorectal stenosis (or another type of low anorectal malformation), an anterior sacral defect, and presacral mass. The triad may be incomplete but the sacral bony defect is considered to always be present. The sacral mass may be a teratoma, an anterior sacral meningocele, an enteric cyst, dermoid, or a combination of these. Rare cases of malignant transformation were described. Constipation is the most common presenting symptom. Method: Case report with literature review. Results: A newborn female with a vestibular fistula and chronic constipation. During follow up she needed periodic rectal dilatations. When was 3 years-old she started non-responding to laxative therapy and imaging exams revealed a presacral mass, hemisacrum and anorectal stenosis. Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty and tumourectomy of the presacral mass were then performed, which pathology evaluation was compatible with a mature cystic teratoma.Conclusion: Apart from the mandatory rectal examination in patients with severe chronic constipation, an imaging complementary study of the pelvic region may help to diagnose the Currarino triad. Pathology support is essential for the precise diagnose of the presacral mass and exclusion of any malignant transformation. Objective: The 2015 World Health Organisation classification of lung tumours defines colloid adenocarcinoma as \"an adenocarcinoma in which abundant mucin pools replace air spaces\". This category now includes those cystic neoplasms which were previously classified as 'mucinous cystadenocarcinoma'. We present a case of a colloid adenocarcinoma of the lung, which was entirely cystic in nature.",

The patient underwent a right lower lobectomy. Results: Macroscopically, a 93 mm thin-walled, uniloculated cyst was identified, filled with mucinous material and abutting the pleura. Histologically, the cyst was lined partly by atypical mucinous epithelium, which expressed CK20 and CDX2, and partly by benign ciliated columnar epithelium, which expressed CK7. Conclusion: Fewer than 100 cases of pulmonary colloid adenocarcinoma have been reported in the literature. The most important issue for the pathologist is to distinguish whether these tumours represent a primary pulmonary neoplasm or a metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining of colloid adenocarcinoma is variable and may not be helpful. Therefore, clinical and radiological correlation remains vital in the management of such patients. synoptical study, under Masson's method, with the aim to detect the intensity of sclerotic processes. Results: Thoracobiopsy results showed, that together with remained lung tissue, there are structureless homogeneous formations, represented with vitreous connective tissue, where the separate petrification focuses are found, similar formations fill the lumens of alveolas and bronchias, sometimes they include vesicular structures. In zones of pathological formations and hyalinosis, immured deformed bronchias with epithelium metaplasia were found, lumens are spasmed. In lung parenchyma presence of multiple angiomatosis focuses is shown, at that vessels turned to strange form, some of them were filled with \u00abchylous\u00bb content, others were plethorical, arteriovenous anastomosis was found. In subpleural zone of lung tissue vessel proliferation of different size was found, with fibrinoid degeneration of their walls andperivascular lymphoid infiltration with background of fibrosis. Walls of lung arteries are thickened irregularly, muscular layer is hypertrophic. At tinction of tissue material under Masson, hyalinized structure include the connective tissue, partially stained in shades of blue and violet, which certifies the presence of fibrosis process.Conclusion: Described clinical observation shows that adoption of computer tomography and diagnostic videothoracobiopsy of lung into clinical practice gives the ability of morphological verification of rare forms of lung pathology, which allows excluding the diagnostic mistakes, differentially choose the pathogenetic therapy and estimate the disease prognosis.",

            "text": "Objective: In practice, there is frequent histological overlap between atypical lipomatous tumour and a spindle cell lipoma. In the literature, there are few cases reports of this tumour arising in different locations like salivary glands, oral cavity and gingiva. However, rarely it has been described in the larynx. Method: Case report. Results: A 58-year-old women presented with difficulty in swallowing. On examination an exophytic tumour was seen involving the supraglottis and piriform fossa bilaterally. Debulking surgery was perfomed and multiple tissue fragments were sent for histological analysis. Histologically, the neoplasm showed features closely resembling spindle cell lipoma, being composed of mature adipose tissue associated with bland spindle cells interspersed within the collagen bundles. No atypical lipoblasts or florette cells were seen. On Immunohistochemistry, the spindle cells stained positive with CD34. The differential diagnosis included a spindle cell lipoma and atypical lipomatous tumour (well differentiated liposarcoma). Based on the histological features, the former was more favoured. However to further support the diagnosis, FISH analysis was performed for MDM2 amplification. Surprisingly, there was very convincing MDM2 amplification, in keeping with a atypical lipomatous tumour closely simulating a spindle cell lipoma. Conclusion: Atypical lipomatous tumour is a slow growing, infiltrative, and non-metastasizing neoplasm that is microscopically and diagnostically challenging (2). It rarely arises in larynx and has to be distinguished from a spindle cell lipoma which can closely resemble it morphologically. FISH analysis for MDM2 amplification should be considered in the cases with overlapping features to differentiate atypical lipomatous tumour from a benign spindle cell lipoma. Objective: Vascular tumours range from benign hemangiomas to lesions that are locally aggressive but infrequently metastasize, to relatively rare, highly malignant angiosarcoma. There is a paucity of studies on vascular tumours in Nigeria. The objective of this study is to determine and document the relative frequency and pattern of these tumours in our locality. Method: The materials consisted of tissue blocks, glass slides and duplicate copies of histopathology reports of patients whose soft tissue biopsy specimens were received in the Department of Pathology of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital in the of Nigeria, over a period of 10 years. The method employed included retrieving the histopathology request forms, from where clinical data such as age, gender and site of affectation were obtained. The corresponding retrieved archived haematoxylin and eosin slides were reviewed by the Authors and the diagnoses were confirmed. The tumours were classified based on WHO typing of vascular tumour. Objective: Clear cell sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour affecting primarily young adults. This is a melanin-producing soft tissue sarcoma which arise in the deep soft tissue of the distal extremities associated with tendons and aponeuroses. Clear cell sarcoma was described first by Enzinger in 1965 and molecular genetic analysis is highly recommended since the t(12;22) that characterizes clear cell sarcoma has been identified in malignant melanoma. Method: A 33 year old men presented with a 6 month history of a slow growing lobulated gray-white mass in the left big toe measuring 3,4 cm in greatest diameter. The mass was resected. Sections from the mass were studied by means of morphology and immunohistochemistry. Results: Histological examinations confirmed a diagnosis of clear cell sarcoma. Immunohistochemically the neoplastic cells were positive for S 1 0 0 p , M e l a n A , H M B 4 5 , P 1 6 a n d n e g a t i v e f o r EMA,CK7,CK19,Pankeratin,actin,desmin,FXIIIA. The cytoplasm contained large amounts of intracellular glycogen (PAS+). Conclusion: The overall prognosis of clear sarcoma is poor. Tumour, size necrosis and local recurrence have proved to be the most robust prognostic factors. Complete surgical resection remains the optimal treatment for this aggressive chemoresistant tumour. Objective: Ossifying fibromyxoid tumour of soft parts (OFMT) is a well recognised mesenchymal neoplasm of uncertain lineage, first described by Enzinger et al. in 1989. Rarely have cases been reported as malignant. As a result of its controversial origin and uncertain biological behaviour, some do not recognise malignant OFMT. Criteria for malignancy have not yet been defined and universally accepted: there is still confusion and uncertainty between pathologists how to recognise a malignant variant of OFMT. We report a patient with history of typical OFMT that developed multiple metastases. We propose that the Folpe and Weiss criteria, modified to include S100 expression, are used to recognise and characterise malignant OFMT. Method: 9 years following initial diagnosis of OFMT, the patient presented to the sarcoma clinic with a solid lesion in the right calf. Biopsy confirmed OFMT and further imaging including CT, MRI and CT-PET identified six other, distant and radiologically similar lesions. Results: Primary tumour (2006): Histologically it was pseudocapsulated with monomorphic rounded cells proliferation and extensive bone formation. Mitotic index: 4 mitoses x10HPF. IHC profile: positive expression for Vimentin. Negative expression for S100, Desmin, CD34, Bcl 2 and CK's. Metastases histology (2015): Histologically it was similar to the previous tumour. IHC profile showed positive expression for CD10 and negative expression for S100, SMA, and Desmin. Overall in view of the clinical history, was regarded as a metastasis. Conclusion: We confirm the existence of an OFMT with distant metastases and using Folpe and Weiss criteria, we demonstrate the presence of malignancy.",

            "text": "Objective: Lipoma arborescens (LA) is an uncommon intra-articular lesion of the synovium, characterized by villous proliferation of the synovium and replacement of the subsynovial tissue by mature fat cells. Whether LA is neoplastic or not is still not entirely clear. The aim of the study was to evaluate the disease process in LA, with respect to the clinical parameters, and histopathological and immunohistochemical features. Method: Case files of LA diagnosed on histopathology between 2010 and 2016 were collected, to study the case history, and tissue sections were reviewed for the histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis. Results: Seventeen cases of LA diagnosed on histopathology were included in the study, of which one occurred in the hip and the rest were localized to the knee. One patient with psoriatic arthritis has bilateral knee lesion. Four of the cases were primary LA and the rest had significant past history (osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). On histopathological examination, all case showed villous proliferation of the synovium with infiltration with mature adipocytes and focal lymphocytic infiltration. All tissue samples of LA were HMGA2 negative. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that LA is a reactive proliferative condition in response to chronic irritation, injury or inflammation. Objective: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a malignant angiocentric vascular neoplasm composed of cords of epithelioid endothelial cells in a distinctively myxohyaline stroma and characterized by translocations resulting in either WWTR1-CAMTA1 or YAP1-TFE3 fusion gene. Method: A 76 year-old male patient presented with a multiple vertebral and pelvic lytic lesions without primary known, also had bone pain and constitutional syndrome. Bone marrow biopsy was performed, histopathology showed a bone marrow cellularity and hematopoietic devoid of fat, composed of cords and strands of epithelioid cells with variable amounts of palely eosinophilic, often glassy cytoplasm and occasional intracytoplasmic vacuoles (vascular chanel formation), embedded in a myxohyaline stroma, with scant mitotic activity. No necrosis was identified. Results: On immunohistochemical analysis, the neoplastic cells were positive for: CD31, CD34, ERG, vimentin, CAMTA-1, CKAE1-AE3 (focal). And negative for: EMA, TTF1, CD99, CD117, S-100, PSA, desmin. The lession was diagnosed as an EHE. Objective: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) it is an aggressive sarcoma, although no etiological factors have been recognized. UPS most commonly occurs in the extremities, trunk and retroperitoneum, but primary lesions of the parotid gland occur infrequently. Method: A 70 year-old female patient presented with a 1,5-month history of a slowly enlarging but asymptomatic left-sided neck mass. Fine-needle aspiration revealed cellular evidence of a spindle cell neoplasm with features suggestive of sarcoma. Incisional biopsy was performed, histopathology demonstrated enlarged cells with round to oval vesicular nuclei most of wich contained a small nucleolus. The cytoplasm was slightly eosinophilic. Multinuclear giant cells were often observed (CD68+), mitotic figures were also abundant, and there was no necrosis. Vascular invasion was identified (CD34+). Residual atrophic ducts were scattered in the tumour adjacent gland tissue. Results: On immunohistochemical analysis, the neoplastic cells were positive for: Vimentin, EMA, \u03b11antichymotrypsin. And negative for: CKAE1/AE3, S-100, melan-A, HMB-45, CD45, CD99, CD117, SMA, desmin, CD31, CD34, D-240, sinaptofisin, CDX2, GCDFP15, mammaglobin, calponin, CD10. The mass was diagnosed as an UPS of the parotid gland. The patient died 1 month after diagnosis. Conclusion: -In the most recent WHO classification, UPS is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. It represents no more than 5 % of an adult soft tissue sarcomas. -UPS of the parotid gland is considered an uncommon malignancy. -The treatment of choice for the primary site is surgical resection with cervical lymphadenectomy for advanced tumours. Postoperative radiation therapy is recommended in view of the high rate of local recurrence. Objective: Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) is a rare malignant mesenchymal tumour composed of neoplastic cells producing bone osteoid. It accounts for about 1-2 % of all soft-tissue sarcomas. Method: We report a case of a ESOS involving the forearm, assessing its clinical, radiological and microscopic features. Results: A 57 year-old man presented with an enlarging mass on the lateral-volar aspect of the right forearm. CT-exam demonstrated a well-demarcated soft-tissue mass with no connection to the bone. A biopsy was performed, the morphological examination revealing a spindle-cell proliferation with high cytological atypia and a increased mitotic rate, arranged in a storriform pattern, with a non-specific immunohistochemical profile. Following surgical excision, the tumour was found to exhibit neoplastic osteoidm a t r i x f o r m a t i o n a n d c h o n d r o i d d i f f e r e n t i a t i o n . Immunohistochemical profile exhibited diffuse positivity for SMA, CD99 with focal S-100 staining in the chondroid area and negative staining for CD34, CK7, AE1-AE3, CDK4, CD57 and p53, therefore excluding other malignancies such as synovial sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Based on the histological features, immunohistochemical profile and radiological aspect, a diagnosis of ESOS was made. Conclusion: ESOS represents a rare and challenging diagnosis, requiring extensive histological examination correlated with the radiological findings. Objective: Desmoid type fibromatosis is rare soft tissue tumour. The objective of our study is to investigate the epidemiological, clinical and histological features of 7 cases of desmoid tumour. Method: It is a retrospective analysis about 7 cases of desmoid tumour collected in our service during 10 years. Settings concerning sex, age, localisation, size and histology were precised in each case. Results: Six cases were female and one was male. The most represented age group was between 40 and 60 years. Two cases was localized in the cervical region, two cases in the abdominal wall, one case in the inguinal area, one case in the right thigh and one case in the right hypochondria. The size varied between 2 and 12 cm. All cases showed a variably cellular proliferation composed of spindle cells arranged into fascicles with dense collagen separating the tumour cells. The cells lack nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic figures were rare. Characteristically there is infiltaration of muscle tissue. Conclusion: Desmoid tumour is a benign slowly growing soft tissue tumour with potential local recurrence and invasive growth, requires prolonged surveillance. The Treatment of choice is large surgical resection. Radiotherapy has been shown to improve local control of aggressive fibromatosis. Objective: Among the rare tumours diagnosed in our department figure liposarcomas. These tumours are extremely hard to diagnose without IHC coloration because the histological picture they present is difficult to differentiate from other histological entities. We will present the case of a 28-year-old young man admitted to the cardiovascular surgery department on February 15, 2016 and diagnosed with mediastinal tumour and generalized myasthenia gravis. Method: Macroscopic examniation shows two fragments: 1. An 1.5/1.5/ 1-cm, discoidal tumoural fragment, no incapsulation, hard consistency, yellow-brown-reddish in colour with brownish central areas; 2. An 8/6/2cm thymus, surrounded by, and intricate with adipose tissue in its mass. Results: Of the thymic carcinomas, there were 6 men and 3 women (ages 25-77 years, mean 58). The histologic types were 5 squamous, 1 small cell neuroendocrine, 1 large cell neuroendocrine, 1 clear cell, and 1 undifferentiated thymic carcinoma. Of the 9 cases, five were resections, with tumour stages of pT2 (1 case), pT3 (3 cases) and pT4 (1 case). All of these tumours were incompletely excised. Immunohistochemistry for CD117 showed positivity in only the squamous carcinomas (4/4). CD5 was positive in all of the squamous carcinomas (4/4) and the one case of undifferentiated thymic carcinoma (1/1). The undifferentiated carcinoma was positive for TTF-1, CK8/18, and synaptophysin (focal). Pax-8 was only positive in the 1 case of undifferentiated thymic carcinoma (1/1). Of 6 patients with follow-up, the patient with clear cell thymic carcinoma developed spinal metastases; one patient with squamous cell thymic carcinoma had drop metastases and was placed on hospice care; and the others were alive with no evidence of disease. Monday, 26 September 2016-Thursday, 29 September 2016, Hall 11.3 E-PS-22 Thymic and Mediastinal Pathology Conclusion: Thymic carcinomas are locally aggressive with potential for metastasis. Immunohistochemical stains for CD117 and CD5 were positive in all squamous carcinomas in this series, potentially useful in determining site of origin. Results: ROs demonstrated predominantly BerEP4 expression, but no CK19 expression. Unlike ROs, ChRCCs showed CK19 expression, but no or focal BerEP4 expression. This distinctive opposite expression pattern was highlighted in HOCTs. CCRCCs showed variable expression patterns for both antibodies. PRCC demonstrated diffuse and strong CK19 and BerEp4 expressions in a variable proportion. Unlike CCRCC, MCRCN showed BerEP4 expression, but no expression for CK19. Unclassified RCCs showed strong CK19 and weak BerEP4 expressions in epithelioid areas, but no or scattered CK19 and BerEp4 expressions in spindle cell areas. UC-RP showed diffuse and strong CK19 expression, but no or focal BerEP4 expression. Conclusion: This study revealed that 1) BerEP4 and CK19 expressions are variable and distinctive in epithelial tumours of kidney and renal pelvis, 2) an immunoprofile of BerEP4 (+)/CK19 (\u2212) is favor of RO unlike ChRCC, 3) PRCC, type 1 expressed both biomarkers, and 4) although RCC subtypes express CK19 in a variable proportion, diffuse and strong CK19 expression is favor of UC-RP.",

Erdem * , A. Cirakoglu, E. Benli Method: The study included a total of 46 cases of prostate. 22 of them were PA, 24 of them were PAH. The youngest case was 46 years old, the oldest case was 83 years old in PA. GS ranged from 4 to 10. PV ranged from 21 to 135. PSA values ranged from 1 to 1122. The youngest case was 50 years old, the oldest case was 86 years old in PAH. PV ranged from 36 to 111. PSA values ranged from 1 to 16. Results: Statistically, there were significant correlations between psa and GS (p = 0.031) in PA cases. However, There were not significant correlations between PSA and age (p = 0.121) and age and GS (p = 0.824). There were not significant correlations between PV and age (p = 0.175) and PSA and PV (p = 0.110). There were not significant correlations among age and PSA and PV (p = 0.468, 0.693, 0.346 respectively) in PAH. Conclusion: Relationship between PSA and GS may be more significant correlation within prognostic parameters in PA. Objective: Tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma (TCC) represents less than 1 % of renal carcinomas and is a new entity recognized by WHO classification (2016) . For decades considered a \"low-grade collecting duct carcinoma\", its tubular differentiation was evidenced by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. A possible relationship with Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC) based on similarities and synchronous papillary lesions has been investigated. We present a synchronous TCC and PRCC in the context of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Method: A 58 years-old male presented with fever, hematuria and lumbar pain post-TURP. TC showed hydronephrosis and renal atrophy of the left kidney without obstruction. Renogram revealed a non-functioning left kidney and a nephrectomy was performed. Results: Macroscopic examination revealed two cortical separated tumours: a 2 cm, unencapsulated, spongy tumour and a close but independent, white and irregular lesion with 0,6 cm. Microscopically these tumours corresponded to a TCC and a type 1 PRCC, respectively. Conclusion: A pathogenetic relationship between TCC and PRCC has been explored by several groups. TCC shares cytogenetic chromosomal gains with PRCC. However, by gene expression profiling discordant results were obtained. Only three TCC in ESRD are reported in the literature. This is the second synchronous TCC and PRCC diagnosed in ESRD. Objective: Cell adhesion molecules (CAM) are required for maintaining a normal epithelial phenotype. Abnormalities in CAM expression have been related to cancer progression. This study aimed to analyze ecadherin, p-cadherin and b-catenin expression in urothelial carcinomas and to correlate them with clinicopathologic data. Method: Thirty-six paraffin tissue blocks from corresponding urothelial carcinoma cases were selected. Tissue microarrays were constructed using three cores of each case. Immunostains were performed using antibodies for e-cadherin, p-cadherin and b-catenin. The immunohistochemical results were correlated with conventional clinicopathological parameters. Results: All cases were usual urothelial carcinomas without any other specification. Patients'age ranged between 47 and 84 years old (mean age 67.3 years). Nineteen cases (19/36, 52.8 %) were of high grade and one third of the tumours were infiltrative. Expression of e-cadherin and pcadherin was observed in 54.3 and 41.2 % of the cases, respectively. There was no association between CAM expression and tumour size, grade, infiltration or aggressive behaviour. A positive association was observed between e-cadherin and p-cadherin expression (p = 0.002). The majority of the cases (72.2 %) expressed b-catenin. -Thursday, 29 September 2016 .3 E-PS-23 Uropathology Objective: Hydatid disease (HD) is an endemic parasitic enfestation in several Mediterranean countries and constitutes an important health problem. It may arise in any organ, however isolated kidney involvement represents 4 % of the confirmed cases. Preoperative diagnosis of renal HD is difficult even in an endemic zone. Our aim is to emphasize the importance of this rare tropical disease in order to encourage physicians to consider this entity in differential diagnosis of a renal mass. Results: A 67-year-old female patient presented with complaints of left flank pain. The medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a mild costovertebral angle tenderness. Routine hematology and biochemical tests showed a mild leukocytosis (18,78 K/uL). BUN, urea and creatinine levels were normal. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a multilobular cystic renal mass of 4,7 \u00d7 4,2 \u00d7 2,8 cm in size in the left kidney, which was suspicious for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The patient underwent a radical nephrectomy and a pathologic diagnosis of renal HD was reached. Thorax and cranial CT revealed no sign of HD. The patient was given a medical treatment of oral albendazole. Conclusion: It should be noted that renal HD is rare entity that may easily be confused with multicystic RCC, radiologically. Objective: To report a rare case of an urothelial carcinoma of the prostatic urethra presenting as a testicular tumour. Method: A 64-year-old man presented with hematuria and a palpable mass to the right testis. AFP and bhCG were within normal range and a right orchiectomy was performed. Results: Macroscopically, the testis was grayish, solid, hard. Microscopically, a malignant, poorly differentiated tumour was observed, with mostly intratubular and focally intertubular growth throughout the testis, resembling embryonal carcinoma. A detailed immunohistochemical approach showed negativity for Vimentin, PLAP, CD117, bhCG, AFP, InhibinA, CD30, NSE, CK20, PSA, CD57 and positivity for p53, CKAE1/AE3, CK7, CK34bE12, p63, AMACR and uroplakin. A month later, transurethral resection of the prostate was performed, due to urinary obstruction. Microscopically, an invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma was diagnosed. Because of the similar microscopical and immunohistochemical characteristics of both tumours, the tumour of the testis was diagnosed as a metastasis of the aforementioned urothelial carcinoma. Conclusion: Despite the rarity of documented cases of metastatic urothelial carcinoma to the testis, especially with prominent intratubular growth, the bladder and pelvis should not be overlooked as possible sources. They may simulate primary testicular neoplasms, even in patients with known extratesticular primaries, but information in this topic is limited. Objective: We present a urinary bladder paraganglioma in a 38-year-old man. Method: The patient presented with palpitations, headaches, perspiration and abdominal pain 2 min after urination. A 24 h urine test showed high levels of noradrenaline and normetanephrine, while catecholamines, adrenaline, dopamine, metanephrine and VMAwere within normal range. Computed tomography showed a lesion at the posterior bladder wall which was locally excised. Results: We received a nodular greyish tumour with median diameter 4.5 cm. Microscopically, the neoplasm was located among smooth muscle cells, with high cellularity and solid, trabecular, pseudorosettes focally and classic Zellbalen (alveolar) architecture. The cells had abundant, amphophilic cytoplasm with median to severe nuclear pleomorphism and focally, giant, multinucleated cells. Mitoses were scarce (0-1/10 High Power Fields). The neoplastic cells were positive for neuroendocrine markers and negative for CKAE1/AE3 and p63 and the presence of sustentacular cells was confirmed with S100. Conclusion: Paragangliomas of the urinary bladder are derived from paraganglion cells in the bladder wall. They account for less than 0.05 % of bladder tumours. They usually show clinical symptoms with hypertension, hematuria, headaches and syncope which are associated with urination (\"micturition attack\"). Young age, hypertension, micturition attacks and invasion through the bladder wall may indicate increased potential for malignant behaviour. Objective: we present two cases of Small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the urinary bladder, a rare but distinct neuroendocrine neoplasm that accounts for less than1% of all urinary bladder cancers. Method: Two patients, a 70 year-old woman and a 50 year-old man both chronic smoking, who was admitted to the medicine with history of gross hematuria. Cystoscopy showed a white tumour occupying the bladder. Results: Pathological diagnosis revealed a Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Conclusion: Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the urinary bladder is very rare and it is predominantly a disease of elderly Caucasian men with a median age of 73 years often reveled with macroscopic haematuria. Diagnosis is confirmed with transurethral resection for tissue sampling. Macroscopically, SCC may appear as a large solid, isolated, polypoid, nodular mass. Histologically, all tumours are invasive at presentation. They consist of small cells with nuclear molding, scant cytoplasm and nuclei containing finely stippled chromatin. Mitoses are present. Necrosis is common. Roughly 50 % of cases have areas of urothelial carcinoma and exceptionally squamous cell carcinoma and/or adenocarcinoma. This is important, because the presence of these differentiated areas does not contradict the diagnosis of SCC. The diagnosis is supported by positive immunostaining for CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. The differential diagnosis is metastasis, lymphoma, lymphoepithelioma-like or plasmocytoid carcinoma and a poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma Objective: Glomus tumours were first described by Masson in 1924 as a benign mesenchymal tumour that arises from the subcutaneous tissue of the extremities. It can be rarely seen in visceral organs like kidney. We described an extremely rare primary renal glomus tumour which has only nine reported cases in the literature. Method: A 51 years old woman admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. USG and MRI findings revealed a cystic lesion located at the lower pole of the left kidney. The lesion was cystic and 46 mm in diameter with 16 \u00d7 10 mm and 30 \u00d7 10 mm solid nodules in it. The lesion was excised by partial nephrectomy. Results: Macroscopically, the mass was well circumscribed, multicystic and measuring 70 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 40 mm in size. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of bland cells with round to oval nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. There was no atypical mitosis and necrosis. Immunohistochemically, there was strong positivity with vimentin, SMA, CD34, collagen and laminin. On the other hand EMa, keratin, CD10, CD117, HMWK, p63, pax-8 and GATA-3 were completely negative. Conclusion: We presented the morphological and, immunohistochemical features of the glomus tumour to differentiate it from the other renal tumours on the basis of the literature.",

            "text": "Objective: The most common pediatric renal tumour is Wilms' tumour which occurs between 6 months and 3 years of age. Specific syndromes and clinical presentations are also associated with Wilms' tumour. However there are some rare entities that are in the differential diagnosis of Wilms' tumour. Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney and rhabdoid tumour are two rare renal tumours which account %2-3 of all malignant pediatric kidney tumours. We report here two renal neoplasms with a clinical suspicion of Wilms' tumour. Method: First case is a 10 month's old male patient with inguinal diaper dermatitis and diarrhea. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed a large 11 cm sized right renal mass with heterogeneous enhancement. The patient underwent right nephrectomy with an initial diagnosis of Wilms' tumour. Wilms' tumour diagnosis was ruled out with microscopical and immunohistochemical findings. End diagnosis was a clear cell sarcoma. Results: Second case was a 2 years old male child with complaint of abdominal flank mass and hematuria. Abdominal CT showed a left sided 10 cm sized renal mass. Initial diagnosis was Wilms' tumour. A hipodens lesion on the liver and bilateral pulmonary metastasis were seen on CT. Rhabdoid tumour of the kidney was the final diagnosis with lack of INI1 immunostaining. Conclusion: Clear cell sarcoma and rhabdoid tumour should be considered in the differential diagnosis when dealing with a pediatric tumour. Loss of INI1 immunostaining, absence of epithelial, mesenchymal components and lack of WT1 immunostaining, pale H&E staining of the tumour cells or identifying the rhabdoid features of the tumour should alert the pathologist for these rare entities. Objective: Prostate carcinomas showing aberrant diffuse-nuclear p63 expression are extremely rare. This protein is strongly expressed in prostatic basal cells and absent from usual-type acinar prostate cancers. Method: A 71 -year-old male patient presented with lower urinary tract symptoms for of 1-month duration and his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 8.6 ng/mL. A ten-quadrent transrectal ultrasonographyguided prostate needle biopsy was performed. Results: Transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate detected atypical, small prostatic glands suspected for adenocarcinoma at 2 cores. These atypical glands were diffusely strongly positive for p63 in the secretory cells, negative for HMWCK, positive for AMACR, positive for PSAP, and negative for GATA-3. The diagnosis was prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7, with aberrant diffuse p63 expression. The patient underwent a radical prostatectomy and the final diagnosis was prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7, stage pT2a. Conclusion: The differential diagnosis of p63-positive prostatic adenocarcinomas includes urothelial carcinoma with microglandular pattern, basal cell proliferations, such as basal cell hyperplasia or basal cell carcinoma. Particularly, pathologist need to be aware of this rare and unusual phenomenon which is taken from needle biopsy. Objective: Clear cell (tubulo) papillary renal cell carcinoma is a distinct subtype of renal cell carcinoma first described in the setting of end stage renal disease. Method: Histologically, the tumour cells are cuboidal to low columnar cell with clear cytoplasm and papillary and tubulo-papillary configuration. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells generally show diffuse expression for cytokeratin 7, CA9 (cup-shaped pattern), HIF-1, GLUT-1 and high molecular weight cytokeratin, but negative for AMACR, RCC Ma and TFE3. CD10 is negative or focally positive in most tumours. Genetically, this tumour has no characteristics of clear cell RCC or papillary RCC. These tumours appear to be indolent in nature, with no current documented cases of metastatic spread. The aspects of disease concept and clinical behavior are to be fully elucidated. Results: A 61-year-old male presented with flank pain of 2 years durations. He gave a history of an open prostatectomy 6 years ago. Ultrasound and computer tomography of Abdomen showed stones in the right ureter and calyces. The patient was performed right nephrectomy due to non functional kidney. The renal mass was revealed incidentally during the pathological examination. \u0130mmunohistochemically, tumour cells showed diffuse expression for cytokeratin 7 but were negative for AMACR. Conclusion: As this a very rare tumour, we presented this case. Objective: Urothelial carcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation is a rare and highly malignant neoplasm. A variable proportion of syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells with positive \u03b2-hCG immunohistochemical expression, along with nests of transitional cell carcinoma, are characteristic of this particular entity. Method: Case 1: 69-year-old male with macroscopic hematuria. A 9 cm necrotizing mass was detected in the left kidney by ultrasound and CT. Case 2: 61-year-old male with macroscopic hematuria. A 4 cm mass was detected in the left kidney by ultrasound. Results: Both cases showed similar histological features. Nests of high grade transitional cell carcinoma, as well as areas with syncytiotrophoblast cells were detected. \u03b2-hCG was intensely positive in syncytiotrophoblast cells. In addition, transitional cells showed CK7 and CK20 immunostaining. Conclusion: Urothelial carcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm of the renal pelvis. It tends to be multifocal, it is more common in males and occurs more frequently at an advanced age. Multiple risk factors are associated: cigarette smoking, industrial carcinogens and chronic irritation, as well as genetic factors. Urothelial carcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation is a rare condition and it is associated with highly malignant clinical behavior. Increased \u03b2-hCG serum and/or urine levels are the first symptom in some patients. Objective: Metastases of testicular seminoma (TS) to the urogenital system are rarely reported, with only a few cases involving the bladder. Method: We present the case of a 55-year-old man admitted to the Urology Department for hematuria and a bladder cancer suspicion. A transuretral resection was performed and the morphological features suggested a malignant tumour infiltrating the bladder wall, composed of nests of polygonal tumour cells with abundant cytoplasm, separated by fibrous septa with lympocytes. The overlying urothelium was normal. Considering this morphology, neoplasms, but increased awareness of the entity and complementary diagnostic tools may help in its correct classification.",

Cozaru * Ovidius University of Constant, Faculty of Medicine, Constanta, RomaniaObjective: Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the testis is an uncommon disease and that represent 1-2 % of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It accounts for about 9 % of testicular neoplasms. Histologically, 80 % to 90 % of primary testicular lymphomas are diffuse large-cell type with B cell phenotype, but isolated cases of other histological subtypes have been described such as Burkitt and burkitt's-like types in 10-20 % of cases, mainly in HIV+ patients. Method: In many cases, the frequency and histologically type of those tumours can be confused with undifferentiated embryonar testicular carcinoma. In both situations the prognosis is unpropitious, but lymphoma needs radiotherapy before and after surgery depending by stage. Embryonar carcinoma of testis is treating by chemotherapy in conventional-dose of cytostatic. Results: In this paper we present a case report with primary non-Hodgkin testicular lymphoma in one 34 years old patient. The particularities of case are the age of patient and tumour morphological features witch can be confused with undifferentiated seminoma. Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the usefulness of immunohistochemistry in pathology diagnoses especially in locating rare diseases at several levels. Objective: Evaluation of CD44 and EGFR genes expression as markers of aggressiveness factors expression in urinary bladder lesions in relation to bilharzasis. Method: Urinary bladder biopsies were subjected to histopathological examination, Immunohistochemical and FISH technique. Results: Our results showed that cases of bilharzial cystitis showed significantly higher percentages and higher scores of CD44 expression compared to non-bilharzial cystitis (p < 0.01). Bilharzia (TCC+SCC) cases showed significantly higher scores of both EGFR and CD44 expression, compared to non-Bilharzial (TCC+SCC) cases. EGFR protein and gene were upregulated in malignant urothelial lesions namely TCC and SCC, with significant correlation with grade of neoplasia. CD44 expression was also upregulated in urothelial bladder lesions especially SCC and was correlated positively with both the grade and stage of malignancy. All examined control, cystitis and adenocarcinoma cases showed negative results for EGFR gene activation by FISH technique. All cases of bilharzial TCC showed positive gene expression which is considered significant when compared with other non-bilharzial TCC (p < 0.01). No significant difference in gene expression was detected between bilharzial and non-bilharzial cases of SCC (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Grouping cases of (TCC+SCC), showed a significantly higher scores of both EGFR and CD44 expression in bilharzial patients compared to non-bilharzial patients, pointing to the possible role of bilharzial infection in progression of cancer and can be used as a markers. TCC subgroups showed variable expression of EGFR and CD44, denoting possibly different molecular backgrounds.",

Isik Gonul * Gazi University, Surgical Pathology, Ankara, TurkeyObjective: MiT family translocation renal cell carcinomas (TRCC) are malignant neoplasms that are mostly seen in young adults or children. They were first published in the 2004 WHO classification as Renal Carcinomas Associated with Xp11.2 translocations /TFE3 gene. Method: There are many types of TFE3 and TFEB transcription factor gene fusions that cause TRCC. Different histologic patterns can be seen in this tumours; but the major component is usually clear cells with papillary structures and cell islands encircled with thin walled capillaries. Results: We have collected our 4 TRCC cases that were diagnosed between the years 2010 and 2015. Of these 4 cases only 1 is a female and the ages of the patients are between 6 and 16. None of our patients had a history of cancer or familial background with tumours. All of our patients were in advanced stage such as 2 patients stage 3 and 2 patients stage 4. Conclusion: MiT family translocation renal cell carcinomas can be seen in adults also but they are mostly pediatric tumours. They have different histologic appearances like papillary, alveolar, tubular, etc. They have to be in mind while distinguishing renal cell carcinoma subtypes.",

Erem * Karadeniz Technical University, Pathology, Trabzon, TurkeyObjective: Corticomedullary mixed tumours are rare primary benign tumours of the adrenal gland and approximately 20 cases have been reported in the literature. Herein, we describe a case of corticomedullary mixed tumour of the adrenal gland and review its clinical and histological features. Method: The surgical specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded. The sections were stained with routinary H&E. Immunohistochemistry was performed. Results: A 36-year-old woman presented with hypertension, obesity and hepatomegaly. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging showed a left heterogeneous incidental adrenal mass and patient underwent a left adrenalectomy. On gross examination, resected tumour was a single well-circumscribed ovoid mass measuring 4.5 \u00d7 4 cm and confined within the normal adrenal gland with cystic areas. Histological examination showed a single tumour mass composed of an admixed population of adrenal cortical and medullary cells. Immunohistochemical studies were positive both for cortical cells (inhibin-\u03b1 and synaptophysin) and medullary cells (Chromogranine A). Microscopic and immunohistochemical findings were compatible with corticomedullary mixed tumour of the adrenal gland. Conclusion: Corticomedullary mixed tumour of the adrenal gland is very uncommon and usually discovered on histological examination. ",
