In this study, we used Kunming outbred mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbANKA) to elucidate the profiles of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) and its ligand galecin-9 (Gal-9) in the development of ALI. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 6 PbANKA-infected red blood cells. The lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) were harvested at days 5, 10, 15, and 20 post infections (p.i.). The grade of lung injury was histopathologically evaluated. Tim-3-and Gal-9-positive cells in the lungs and MLNs were stained by immunohistochemistry, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of Tim-3, Gal-9, and related cytokines were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analyses were performed from days 18 to 20 p.i. The results showed that the pathological severities in the lungs were increased with times and the total protein level in the BALFs was significantly elevated in PbANKA-infected mice. The numbers of Gal-9 + and Tim-3 + cells in the lungs were significantly increased, and the mRNA levels of both Gal-9 and Tim-3 in the lungs and MLNs were over-expressed in PbANKA-infected mice.

Accumulating evidence indicates that galectins fall into the category of immune regulatory molecules. Gal-9 ameliorates respiratory syncytial virus-induced pulmonary immunopathology through regulating the balance between Th17 and regulatory T cells (Lu et al. 2015) . Gal-9 exerts its pivotal immunomodulatory effects by inducing apoptosis or suppressing effector functions via engagement with its receptor, Tim-3. Interaction of soluble Gal-9 with Tim-3 expressed on the surface of activated CD4 + T cells renders them less susceptible to HIV-1 infection, while enhanced HIV infection occurs when Gal-9 interacts with a different receptor than Tim-3, indicating the versatile role of Gal-9 in viral pathogenesis (Merani et al. 2015) . In addition, the plasma levels of Gal-9 appear to track dengue virus inflammatory responses and may serve as an important novel biomarker of acute dengue virus infection and disease severity (Chagan-Yasutan et al. 2013) . In this study, we demonstrated that PbANKA infection induces the upregulation of Gal-9 and Tim-3 expressions in the lungs and MLNs. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that KM mice may be a good alternative animal model for the study of lethal murine malaria (Huang et al. 2013) . In this study, we successfully constituted a PbANKA-induced ALI in KM mice, dyspnea, or respiratory insufficiency occurred between 18 to 22 days p.i. before deaths. The lung tissue damages were observed from day 5 p.i.; histopathological examination showed that the major changes in the lungs of these mice were characterized by inflammatory cellular infiltration (mainly polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, and mononuclear cells in the alveolar and interstitial sites), alveolar edema, and hemorrhage, with highly parasitized RBCs. In addition, the level of BALF total protein was increased in our animal model, which is indicative of alveolar-capillary membrane barrier disruption (Ware and Matthay 2000; Guidot et al. 2006) . Immunologic mechanisms are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of malaria-induced ALI, and the study of cells and molecules with immunoregulatory activity has begun to gain importance in recent years. Studies have highlighted the immunomodulatory properties of \u03b2-galactoside-binding protein, Gal-9, and its receptor Tim-3 in parasitic diseases (Katoh et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2014 ). Gal-9 can be highly modulatory for immune function depending on the circumstance (Wiersma et al. 2013) , and some of this activity is mediated by the inhibitory molecule Tim-3 (Zhu et al. 2005) . Although data about the role of Gal-9/TIM-3 pathway in the pathogenesis of human diseases is emerging, research about their role during malaria is scarce. In the present study, by using immunohistochemical technique, we found that the numbers of Tim-3 + and Gal-9 + cells in the lungs and MLNs of PbANKA-infected mice were significantly increased at all the times in comparison of uninfected controls; at the same time, the mRNA levels of Tim-3 and Gal-9 were significantly increased in the lungs and MLNs after infection. It has been reported that Tim-3 binding to Gal-9 stimulates anti-microbial immunity (Jayaraman et al. 2010) . Administration of exogenous reGal-9 significantly ameliorates hepatocellular damage caused by liver ischemia and reperfusion injury in mice, which may be a new therapeutic strategy against innate immunity-dominated liver tissue damage (Hirao et al. 2015) . In addition, our data showed that pro-inflammatory (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were over-expressed in the lungs, and IL-6 and IL-10 were over-expressed in the MLNs after PbANKA infection. IL-10 is originally released by Th2 cells but now is found to be produced by other types of cells as well including B cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells (O'Garra and Vieira 2007) . The activation of the immune system by antigens released by P. falciparum plays an important role in the induction and worsening of lung damage (Boulos et al. 1993 ). CD36 and Fyn kinase are critical mediators of malaria-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction in mice infected with PbANKA (Anidi et al. 2013) . Therefore, although the actual regulatory mechanisms for the control of cell surface Gal-9 and Tim-3 were unknown, the increase of Gal-9 + and Tim-3 + cells as well as the enhancement of Gal-9 and Tim-3 expressions in PbANKA-induced ALI, which may play an important role in the development of ALI in murine malaria.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 123, "text": "(Merani et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 375, "end": 391, "text": "(Lu et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 839, "end": 859, "text": "(Merani et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1081, "text": "(Chagan-Yasutan et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1370, "text": "(Huang et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2081, "text": "(Ware and Matthay 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2082, "end": 2101, "text": "Guidot et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2486, "text": "(Katoh et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2501, "text": "Wu et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2586, "end": 2607, "text": "(Wiersma et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2681, "end": 2698, "text": "(Zhu et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3308, "end": 3331, "text": "(Jayaraman et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3569, "end": 3588, "text": "(Hirao et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3960, "end": 3985, "text": "(O'Garra and Vieira 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 4132, "end": 4151, "text": "(Boulos et al. 1993", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 4283, "end": 4302, "text": "(Anidi et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, because the nature of the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway in malaria is poorly defined, we studied their expression, immunological, and pathological relevance in a mouse model in the current study.
