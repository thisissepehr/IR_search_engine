The putative NS1 resulting from such a spliced transcript encoded a 750-780 amino acid protein with a carboxy terminus that showed significant similarity to that of the canine and bovine bocaviruses NS1 ( Figure 5C ) [39, 40] . A study using RT-PCR for the detection of HBoV1 viral transcript in human lung epithelial cells did not detect the NS splicing proposed here [41] . On the other hand, the proposed NS1 RNA splicing and NS1 protein expression itself were detected using Northern blots and NS1 C-termini specific sera, respectively, in 293 and human epithelial cells transfected with plasmids expressing HBoV1 transcripts (Jianming Qiu, personal communication).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 921, "end": 925, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 926, "end": 929, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1077, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 261, "text": "Figure 5A", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 464, "end": 474, "text": "Figure 5A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 909, "end": 918, "text": "Figure 5C", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Splicing in NS."}, {"text": "Most PCR-positive stool samples contained HBoV2B (76 of 101), making this genotype the most commonly detected enteric human bocavirus (Table  1) .

HBoV1 was detected in only 4 of the 101 positive samples. Stool samples from patients with AFP in Nigeria and Tunisia both showed a high prevalence of HBoV2A+B (21%-26%). Because both patients with AFP and healthy contacts from Tunisia showed a comparable prevalence of HBoV2, no asso- ciation was observed between AFP and HBoV2 excretion. The prevalence of HBoV2 in adults with diarrhea from the United States and Nepal were also compared with those in healthy matched subjects. No associations were observed between HBoV2 shedding and diarrhea. Although the numbers of HBoV3 and HBoV4 detected were relatively small, it was noticed that the 8 HBoV3-and 4 HBoV4-positive samples were found among 192 samples from patients with AFP, whereas these 2 species were not detected among 96 healthy Tunisian matched contacts. Comparing the combined Nigerian and Tunisian patients with AFP infected with HBoV3 and HBoV4 to Tunisian controls yielded a 2-tailed Fisher's exact P value of .01, whereas comparing only the Tunisian patients with AFP with Tunisian controls gave a P value of .059. HBoV3 was also found in 1 patient with diarrhea from the United States and from 1 healthy person each from the United States and Nepal.

The availability of novel bocavirus genomes will allow the design of species-specific PCR or microarray oligonucleotides for their detection and for the disease association studies that are now required for the 3 recently characterized enteric human bocavirus species (HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4). Based on the phylogenetic clustering observed for a large number of partial VP1 sequences ( Figure 1 ) and the distances among full genomes (Table 2) , we propose for future classification that HBoV strains showing 18% protein and 110% nucleotide difference in the complete VP1 gene should be considered different species, whereas those showing 11.5% protein and 15% nucleotide difference should be considered different genotypes.
