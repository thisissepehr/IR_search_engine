To achieve equivalent protective efficacy in the absence of EP, we evaluated VEEV and EBOV DNA vaccines constructed using minimalized Nanoplasmid expression vectors that are smaller than conventional plasmids used for DNA vaccination. These vectors may also be designed to co-express type I interferon inducing innate immune agonist genes that have an adjuvant effect. Nanoplasmid vaccinated mice had increased antibody responses as compared to those receiving our conventional pWRG7077-based vaccines when delivered by IM injection, and these responses were further enhanced by the inclusion of the innate immune agonist genes. The Nanoplasmid VEEV DNA vaccines also significantly increased protection against aerosol VEEV challenge as compared to the pWRG7077 VEEV DNA vaccine. Although all mice receiving the pWRG7077 and Nanoplasmid EBOV DNA vaccines at the dose tested survived EBOV challenge, only mice receiving the Nanoplasmid EBOV DNA vaccine that co-expresses the innate immune agonist genes failed to lose weight after challenge. Our results suggest that Nanoplasmid vectors can improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of alphavirus and filovirus DNA vaccines.",

            "text": "Despite their ability to trigger potent innate and adaptive immune responses, the widespread use of DNA vaccines has been hampered logistically by the requirement of specialized methods such as electroporation (EP) for effective delivery. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Delivery methods that require specialized training, advanced technology, or access to a sustainable power source pose significant challenges in remote areas or when enacting a ring vaccination strategy in an outbreak setting. A simpler approach for DNA vaccine delivery that can provide protective efficacy comparable to EP could be advantageous for the broader applicability of this platform. One possible approach for improving DNA vaccine immunogenicity is to modify the DNA vaccine backbone itself. This can include modification of the promoter to enhance antigen expression, removal of antibiotic selection markers, and elimination of nonfunctional sequences that can limit expression. Nature Technology Corporation (NTC) has tested this approach by developing minimalized Nanoplasmid expression vectors. 6, 7 These vectors are smaller than traditional DNA vaccine plasmids, allowing for improved uptake and persistence in transfected cells. Large extragenic regions of bacterial DNA can also mediate transgene silencing in certain tissues, a phenomenon that may be avoided by the use of shorter DNA sequences. 8 This subsequently leads to increased transgene expression that can yield enhanced immune responses and sustained improvements in immunological memory. 9 NTC has also designed Nanoplasmid vectors that co-express innate immune immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA) agonists to function as type I interferon-ab (IFN-ab)inducing genetic adjuvants. These vectors co-express a retinoic acidinducible gene I (RIG-I) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) agonist (NTC-eRNA) or the dsRNA RIG-I agonist as well as a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) stimulating CpG motif (NTC-eRNA-CpG). IFN-ab is a powerful genetic adjuvant, enhancing both cellular and humoral responses. [10] [11] [12] [13] NTC previously tested an influenza H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine expressed from the NTC-eRNA vector. 14 Vaccination with the NTC-eRNA/HA vaccine significantly improved antibody titers and antibody binding avidity compared to the standard NTC/ HA vector. Additionally, as IFN-ab is required for optimal DNA vaccine immunogenicity, 1, 15, 16 inclusion of an IFN-ab stimulating agonist may compensate for any reduction in the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine delivered in the absence of EP.",

            "text": "Our laboratory has developed and evaluated DNA vaccines for several highly pathogenic biodefense-related targets, including the alphavirus Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). Natural mosquitoborne transmission of VEEV to humans can result in severe neurological disease, but aerosol VEEV infection may yield increased morbidity and mortality compared to that observed with natural infection. [17] [18] [19] [20] We previously demonstrated that a candidate VEEV DNA vaccine (pWRG/VEEV) expressing codon-optimized E2 and E1 envelope glycoprotein (GP) genes delivered by intramuscular (IM)-EP elicits robust VEEV-specific immune responses and protects mice and nonhuman primates (NHPs) against aerosol VEEV challenge. 21, 22 Subsequently, the pWRG/VEEV vaccine candidate proved to be safe and highly immunogenic in a Phase 1 clinical study, with all subjects developing VEEV-neutralizing antibodies following IM-EP delivery. 23 We have also previously developed and tested a candidate Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) GP DNA vaccine (pWRG/EBOV). When delivered by IM-EP, this DNA vaccine elicited protective immunity against IM EBOV challenge in mice and NHPs. 24, 25 pWRG/EBOV-vaccinated NHPs developed pre-challenge EBOV-neutralizing antibodies, as well as high numbers of EBOV-specific T cells. 25 Our data suggest that DNA vaccination may be an effective means of eliciting protective immunity against filovirus infection, as both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are likely required for protection against EBOV challenge. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Here, we explored the potential benefit of Nanoplasmid vectors engineered to express the codon-optimized VEEV and EBOV GP genes without and with co-expression of the innate immune agonists. Specifically, we evaluated the immune responses and protective efficacy elicited by each of these vaccine candidates following IM injection in a murine model. Our results suggest a potential path forward for VEEV and EBOV Nanoplasmid DNA vaccines delivered by IM injection in the absence of EP.",

For this, COS-7 cells were transfected with 50, 100, or 250 ng of the individual Nanoplasmid constructs or our standard pWRG7077 vaccine plasmids, and the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for analysis of antigen expression levels by flow cytometry. At all DNA concentrations tested, transfection with the various Nanoplasmid constructs resulted in a significantly increased percentage of VEEV E1 + , VEEV E2 + , and EBOV GP + cells compared to pWRG7077 transfected cells ( Figures 1A, 1C , and 1E). To determine whether the increases in antigen expression observed for the Nanoplasmid constructs persist over a longer period of time, we harvested COS-7 cells transfected with 50 ng of the individual Nanoplasmid constructs or our standard pWRG7077 vaccine plasmids at various time points for a period of 7 days after transfection for analysis of antigen expression levels by flow cytometry. In these experiments, significantly increased percentages of VEEV E1 + , VEEV E2 + , and EBOV GP + cells were observed for the Nanoplasmid constructs as compared to the pWRG7077-based constructs up to 7 days post-transfection ( Figures 1B, 1D, and 1E ). Representative histogram plots of VEEV E1 expression are shown in Figure S1 .",

Vaccination with the NTC/VEEV construct resulted in slightly improved, but statistically similar, total immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-VEEV antibody levels compared to those observed in mice receiving the pWRG/VEEV vaccine (Figure 2A ). In contrast, the NTC/VEEV construct with the added isRNA RIG-I agonist yielded a significant increase in total IgG titers. However, additional inclusion of the CpG motif within this construct did not further boost the total IgG response compared to the NTC-eRNA/ VEEV vaccine. Although not statistically significant, vaccination with the NTC-eRNA/VEEV or NTC-eRNA-CpG/VEEV constructs also resulted in IgG1 and IgG2a subtype antibody titers that trended slightly higher than those for the pWRG/VEEV or standard NTC/ VEEV constructs ( Figures 2B and 2C) . Moreover, vaccination with both isRNA-expressing Nanoplasmids trended toward slightly enhanced VEEV-neutralizing antibody generation, suggesting a broad improvement in the humoral response ( Figure 2D ). Unlike for the antibody response, we observed little discernable difference in the cell-mediated immunity elicited in vaccinated mice, as those receiving either the pWRG/VEEV or various Nanoplasmid VEEV DNA vaccines displayed similar numbers of VEEV E1-or E2-specific IFN-g + (Figures 3A and 3B ) and interleukin-2 + (IL-2 + ) T cells (Figures 3C and 3D) as quantified by ELISPOT. Of note, no groups vaccinated with any of the VEEV DNA vaccines delivered by IM injection developed humoral or cell-mediated immune responses equivalent to those observed for the pWRG/VEEV IM-EP control group.",

This is most likely due to IFN-ab's ability to upregulate co-stimulatory molecules, priming CD4 + T cells, and driving the subsequent B cell response. 36, 37 IFN-ab also amplifies the sensitivity of the B cell receptor, boosting the ability of naive B cells to produce high-affinity antibodies. 38 Somewhat surprisingly, the addition of CpG motifs had a limited effect on VEEV DNA vaccine immunogenicity. One possible explanation for this result is the limited effect of TLR9 signaling on DNA vaccine immunogenicity. 1, 39 Alternatively, our results may suggest that a peak response was achieved by inclusion of the RIG-I agonist, and more subtle immune differences may be better discerned at a lower vaccine dose.",

Because neutralizing antibodies directed against the envelope glycoproteins is the most widely accepted correlate of protection against VEEV, 40-42 the trend toward increased neutralization measured for the NTC-eRNA/VEEV and NTC-eRNA-CpG/VEEV vaccinated groups represents one possible explanation for the improved protection from aerosol VEEV challenge. However, neutralizing antibody titers are not always significantly associated with protection against VEEV challenge by the aerosol route. Non-neutralizing antibodies have also proven effective at preventing lethal alphavirus infection, and it has been reported that vaccine-elicited IgG2a (i.e., T h 1 phenotype) correlates strongly with protection from aerosol VEEV challenge. 43 This effect may be due to IgG2a's broad range of effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement fixation. 40 The co-expression of isRNA from the Nanoplasmid vector resulted in increased IgG2a production, albeit not to a statistically significant degree. However, IM vaccinated mice that had a higher ratio of IgG2a to IgG1 appeared to be better protected from VEEV challenge (Figure S2) , suggesting that the improvement in IgG2a levels may have been substantial enough to afford greater protection from challenge. Taken together, the IgG2a data combined with the improved neutralizing capability suggests that the isRNA expressing Nanoplasmid vectors can shape multiple facets of the adaptive immune response required for protection against VEEV challenge.",

The humoral response was further boosted by the addition of the dsRNA/CpG adjuvant. Notably, both Nanoplasmid vaccinated groups exhibited higher levels of IgG2a than did the pWRG/EBOV group. While the correlates of protection for EBOV remain unclear, several reports have detailed the role of IgG2a in conferring protection to EBOV challenge in mice. 28, 44 Moreover, Warfield et al. 45 previously reported that an EBOV VLP vaccine elicited strong ADCC activity in vaccinated NHPs. Follow-on studies suggested that this vaccine elicited weakly neutralizing, but highly protective T h 1 antibodies. 46 Our study suggests a similar protective effect of IgG2a, as IM vaccinated mice with a higher ratio of IgG2a to IgG1 lost less weight following challenge ( Figure S3 ). Although we were not able to quantify significant changes in protection to EBOV challenge at the DNA dose tested here, it is noteworthy that Nanoplasmid vaccination did not negatively impact protective efficacy. In fact, the sustained weight seen in the NTC-eRNA-CpG/ EBOV group suggests that the isRNA may have the ability to augment protective efficacy beyond what was measured here.

However, several questions remain to be addressed in future studies. Of interest is the ability of the Nanoplasmids to improve immunological memory, as well as their ability to spur affinity maturation. Previous reports demonstrating sustained antigen production from Nanoplasmid transfected cells suggest that these effects are possible, but we have yet to characterize them as they were outside the scope of these studies. Finally, as no groups vaccinated by IM injection generated immune responses equal to those elicited by IM-EP, further studies are required to determine whether the Nanoplasmid vectors sufficiently enhance DNA vaccine immunogenicity such that they could offer protective immunity to NHPs, which are a more relevant model of human disease.",

The pWRG/ EBOV DNA vaccine plasmid was constructed in a similar manner by inserting the codon-optimized GP genes (Geneart, Regensburg, Germany) of EBOV-Kikwit 1995 (GenBank: U28077) into the pWRG7077 eukaryotic expression vector as described previously. 24 Codon-optimization of the EBOV GP gene sequence resulted in the ablation of the 7U/8U genomic editing motif of EBOV, preventing production of soluble GP (sGP). The Nanoplasmid vaccines were produced by standard restriction digestion-mediated transfer of the pWRG7077 VEEV and EBOV transgenes into the Nanoplasmid NTC9385R, NTC9385R-eRNA41H, or NTC9385R-eRNA41H-CpG vector.

The RNA is transcribed by either RNA Pol II (isRNA encoded downstream of transgene in the 3 0 UTR; CpG RNA) or RNA Pol III (isRNA transcribed independently from transgene; eRNA41H, a 114 bp RNA Pol III convergently transcribed non-palindromic dsRNA based isRNA that activates RIG-I). 14, 47 In these vectors, EBOV or VEEV transgenes are expressed from the CMV promoter upstream of the HTLV-IR expression enhancer. 48 Research-grade pWRG7077 vaccine plasmids were manufactured by Aldevron (Fargo, ND), while research-grade Nanoplasmid vaccine plasmids were manufactured by Nature Technology Corporation (Lincoln, NE).",

Mice were subsequently challenged on day 50 with 2,000 PFU of mouse-adapted EBOV Mayinga-76 (ma-EBOV) via the IP route. The mice were monitored daily for clinical score and survival. The collective weights of all mice per group were measured daily. 15 days following challenge, the surviving mice were euthanized by exsanguination under deep anesthesia.",

            "text": "High bind ELISA plates (Corning, Corning, NY) were coated with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing either the VEEV E1/E2 antigen or the EBOV GP antigen encoded within the DNA vaccines. VLPs were produced by co-transfection of plasmids expressing the codon-optimized glycoprotein genes (E3-E2-6K-E1) of VEEV IAB (strain Trinidad donkey) or EBOV GP (strain Kikwit 1995) and a scaffolding murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag protein as previously described. 12, 13 Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with pWRG/MLV Gag and either pWRG/VEEV or pWRG/EBOV. Cell supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h post-transfection, pooled, clarified by centrifugation, and filtered through a 0.45 mm filter. VLPs were concentrated through a Centricon filter unit with a 100-kDa cutoff (EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA) according to manufacturer's instructions. VLPs were then pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion in virus resuspension buffer (VRB; 130 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) by centrifugation for 2 h at 106,750 \u00c2 g in an SW32 rotor at 4 C. VLP pellets were re-suspended overnight in VRB at 4 C, pooled, and diluted 10-fold with VRB. The diluted VLPs were re-pelleted without a sucrose cushion as described above. VLPs were re-suspended in 1/ 1,000 volume of VRB relative to starting supernatant and then stored at \u00c080 C. ELISA plates were coated at a concentration of 150 ng/well, and then incubated overnight at 4 C. The following day, plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and then blocked with Neptune Block (ImmunoChemistry Technologies, Bloomington, MN) for 2 h at 37 C. Plates were washed again prior to being loaded with 2-fold serial dilutions of mouse sera in duplicate (dilution range 1:200 to 1:25,600). Serum dilutions were carried out in Neptune Block. Plates were incubated at ambient temperature for 1 h prior to being washed, and then incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-mouse (SeraCare Life Sciences, Gaithersburg, MD) in Neptune Block for 1 h at ambient temperature. Plates were washed again and then developed with Sure-Blue TMB substrate (SeraCare Life Sciences, Gaithersburg, MD). Absorbance at the 450 nm wavelength was detected with a Tecan M1000 microplate reader (Tecan Group, Switzerland). Pooled naive sera collected prior to vaccination were used as an internal control for each assay group. A plate cutoff value was determined based on 2 \u00c2 the average absorbance of the pooled pre-bleed sera from each respective group. End-point titers were determined using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). For antibody subtyping ELISA, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and anti-mouse IgG2a secondary antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. EBOV nucleoprotein ELISA plates were coated with recombinant EBOV nucleoprotein (PanThera Biopharma, Aiea, HI) at a concentration of 10 mg/mL and assayed as described above.",

The sera and pseudovirion mixture was incubated overnight at 4 C. Following this incubation, 50 mL was inoculated onto Vero-76 cell monolayers in clear bottom, black-walled 96-well plates in duplicate. Plates were incubated at 37 C for 18-24 h. The media were discarded and cells were lysed according to the luciferase kit protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). A Tecan M200 Pro (Tecan Group, Switzerland) was used to acquire luciferase data. The values were graphed using Graph-Pad Prism software and used to calculate the percent neutralization normalized to cells alone and pseudovirions alone as the minimum and maximum signals, respectively. The percent neutralization values for duplicate serial dilutions were plotted. 80% PsVNA (PsVNA 80 ) titers were interpolated from 4-parameter curves, and geometric mean titers were calculated in GraphPad Prism 8.",
