However, it remains unknown whether this association represents an independent risk for poor outcome. We aimed to estimate the attributable effect of CMV reactivation on mortality in immunocompetent ARDS patients. Methods: We prospectively studied immunocompetent ARDS patients who tested seropositive for CMV and remained mechanically ventilated beyond day 4 in two tertiary intensive care units in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2013. CMV loads were determined in plasma weekly. Competing risks Cox regression was used with CMV reactivation status as a time-dependent exposure variable. Subsequently, in sensitivity analyses we adjusted for the evolution of disease severity until onset of reactivation using marginal structural modeling. Results: Of 399 ARDS patients, 271 (68 %) were CMV seropositive and reactivation occurred in 74 (27 %) of them. After adjustment for confounding and competing risks, CMV reactivation was associated with overall increased ICU mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 2.74, 95 % CI 1.51-4.97), which resulted from the joint action of trends toward an increased mortality rate (direct effect; cause specific hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95 % CI 0.86-2.90) and a reduced successful weaning rate (indirect effect; cause specific HR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.58-1. 18 ).

The two possible outcomes are interrelated as increased mortality may negatively impact the duration of mechanical ventilation. A competing risks analysis accommodates for this by providing two measures of association. First, the cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR) estimates the direct effects of CMV reactivation on each outcome of interest (i.e., mortality on the ventilator and successful weaning). Second, the subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) estimates the risk of dying from reactivation at a given time-point, while accounting for the competing risk of successful weaning. To obtain direct estimates of cumulative risks in terms of the SHR we used the Fine and Gray model [23] .

As a post hoc sensitivity analysis, we then used marginal structural modeling to assess potential residual confounding by differences in the evolution of disease severity prior to CMV reactivation between both groups, but found very similar results (Table 3) . Changing the definitions of our primary end points to include all deaths in the ICU (irrespective of mechanical ventilation status) and discharge (rather than successful weaning) also did not change these findings (Table S1 ). Furthermore, the independent association with mortality remained among subgroups of patients receiving and not receiving high dose corticosteroid therapy; SHR 2.60 (95 % CI 1.29-5.25) and 3.61 (95 % CI 1.24-10.48), respectively (Table S2 ).

In summary, the total burden of organ dysfunction was slightly higher in patients at the start of CMV reactivation compared to matched non-exposed control subjects, although individual markers of pulmonary dysfunction and inflammation were similar. More importantly, there was a clear trend towards resolution of organ dysfunction over time in nonexposed subjects that was less pronounced in patients having CMV reactivation.

However, a greater understanding of pathophysiology and clinical risk factors is necessary to select the optimal target population for such strategies. In our study, reactivation rates were 27 % in ARDS patients overall and 34 % among those with concurrent septic shock. The latter finding might be explained by the increased severity and duration of immune suppression that may be observed in patients with septic shock, including a pronounced depletion of T cells [31, 32] . Indeed, a recent study investigating the potential use of antiviral prophylaxis based on the screening of ARDS patients for CMV seroprevalence found that such a strategy is unlikely to be beneficial overall, but suggested a possible benefit in a post hoc subgroup of patients with septic shock [16] . As the proportion of patients with CMV reactivation increased in time, altering the minimal length of stay in the ICU as a criterion may also improve the selection of a high-risk target population. Until then, a pre-emptive treatment strategy (by which patients would be screened for CMV and treated only if reactivation occurs) seems more attractive because the number of patients exposed to the toxicity of (val)ganciclovir would be reduced by 73 %. However, the effects of pre-emptive compared to prophylactic treatment on relevant patient outcomes are most likely lower, as treatment is initiated only after reactivation has already begun. Intervention trials comparing prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment, and wait-andsee strategies are necessary before any evidence-based recommendations regarding the clinical management of CMV reactivation in critically ill patients with ARDS can be made.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 109, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 110, "end": 113, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 587, "end": 590, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 887, "end": 891, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study has several strengths.

First, Cox regression analysis requires that censoring of survival time must be non-informative, but in our study this was clearly not the case since ARDS patients who are weaned and discharged from the ICU alive are in a better health state than those who remain on the ventilator beyond that time point [33, 34] . Furthermore, when ICU mortality is the event of interest, then discharge must be regarded as a competing event as it precludes this outcome from being observed [14] . The use of the subdistribution hazard model provides a general solution to this informative censoring. Second, the median time to CMV reactivation in our cohort was 8.5 (IQR 4-11) days. If ignored, such delays may cause distortion (termed immortal time bias) as nonexposed time observed before the onset of reactivation will be wrongfully attributed to the exposed time at risk, resulting in underestimation of effects associated with CMV reactivation [35, 36] .

First, even the use of advanced methodology cannot rule out the possibility of unmeasured confounding in an observational study. Therefore, it remains somewhat uncertain whether the excess mortality that we observed can be fully attributed to CMV reactivation, or whether other unknown factors-including other viral reactivations [8, 37]-may also be involved. Second, the principle of multivariable analysis to adjust for confounders is to statistically 'force' exposed and non-exposed patients to be similar in all aspects of disease aside from their reactivation status. However, in a dynamic ICU setting, during which critically ill patients continuously deteriorate and improve over time, it is very difficult to verify whether such adjustment was successful. We performed marginal structural modeling as a sensitivity analysis to assess the possible impact of variations in the evolution of disease severity between patients on our effect estimates, yet found very similar results as in our primary analysis. Third, we measured systemic CMV reactivation in plasma but did not collect information about concurrent viral loads in the lungs. This study, therefore, provides no insight into either the prevalence or relevance of pulmonary CMV reactivations. Of note, previous studies have shown that pulmonary reactivation may occur without the concurrent viremia [4, 38, 39] . Furthermore, we focused exclusively on the occurrence of reactivation while patients were on mechanical ventilation (primary analysis) or in the ICU (sensitivity analysis), as we considered these to be the most relevant time windows to potentially treat or prevent CMV reactivation in the ICU. However, because of this deliberate focus we cannot provide information about possible episodes of reactivation that may have occurred later. Likewise we did not investigate the occurrence of reactivations after day 35 in the ICU.
