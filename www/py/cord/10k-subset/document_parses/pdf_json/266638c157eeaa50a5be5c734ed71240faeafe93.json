[19] To further reduce the prevalence of HBV, a new vaccination program was implemented in CCI-HBV areas in 2011 (2011 Program), aimed at all healthy adults (HBsAb seronegative) and infants. As part of HBV-FTVT Strategy, 2011 program was different from 1992 program in many aspects including that the 10 \u03bcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was used to achieve immunization effect in CCI-HBV areas. [20] Together, the 1992 and 2011 Programs reduced HBsAg carrier rate in < 15 years-old in Zhejiang province to less than 1%. [19] The 2011 Program confirmed that universal vaccination acted as a protection by creating an immune barrier. [21] In harnessing the power of existing community healthcare programs, CCI areas have achieved longterm follow-up of HBV infections to verify the transformation of HBV carriers (the new infection rate, etc) and apply standard antiviral therapies to reduce patient mortality. These measures led to the HBV mortality in Zhejiang province decreased from 1.54% (2010) to 0.98% (2015). According to the screening data, the second round of HBsAg prevalence has decreased compared with the first round with significant difference. This also proves the effectiveness of CCI comprehensive intervention. In addition, the study of HBV new infection transformation is ongoing. With the development of digital medicine, multiple medical data sources are now available, covering medical system data (HIS/LIS/RIS/PACS/EMR), health behavior data (continuously updated EHRs and personal portable devices), medical tests and medical records, etc. All these data sources constitute a large-scale database, which forms a relatively realistic picture of disease prevalence and cannot be ascertained by artificial calculation. For this reason, the NIP cloud computing was selected for the project data processing task. Now the national information cloud platform is available to all CCI communities and it's under continual development with data uploading.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 189, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 582, "end": 586, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 707, "end": 711, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 819, "end": 823, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Quality control is vital for the epidemiological field research, which could help researchers to discover bias in the data collection process.
