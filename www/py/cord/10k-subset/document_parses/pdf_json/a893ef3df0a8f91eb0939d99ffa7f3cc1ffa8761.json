The timing and underlying mechanisms of ASM transition from a phasic to a tonic contractile phenotype are yet to be established. We characterized phasic ASM contraction in preterm (128 day gestation), term ($150 day gestation), 1-4 month, 1 yr, and adult sheep (5yr). Spontaneous phasic activity was measured in bronchial segments as amplitude, frequency, and intensity. The mechanism of phasic ASM contraction was investigated further with a computational model of ASM force development and lumen narrowing. The computational model comprised a two-dimensional cylindrical geometry of a network of contractile units and the activation of neighboring cells was dependent on the strength of coupling between cells. As expected, phasic contractions were most prominent in fetal airways and decreased with advancing age, to a level similar to the level in the 1-4 month lambs. Computational predictions demonstrated phasic contraction through the generation of a wave of activation events, the magnitude of which is determined by the number of active cells and the strength of cell-cell interactions. Decreases in phasic contraction with advancing age were simulated by reducing cell-cell coupling. Results show that phasic activity is suppressed rapidly after birth, then sustained at a lower intensity from the preweaning phase until adulthood in an ovine developmental model.

Jesudason draws a creative link between asthma and phasic ASM contraction [7] . Transient airflow limitation, which is a primary characteristic of asthma [36] , is conceptually similar to the rhythmic mechanical response associated with phasic ASM contraction. The hypothesis proposed by Jesudason states that reversion to a prenatal ASM phenotype contributes to asthma onset [7] . Given the early life presentation of asthma, we further speculate that phasic ASM contraction may never completely transition in individuals at risk of asthma development. There is now an abundance of evidence to suggest that a number of prenatal factors contribute to asthma development including fetal growth kinetics [37] [38] [39] , preterm birth [40] , and intrauterine infection [41] . Deficits in airway function at birth and in childhood are independent risk factors for the development of asthma [42, 43] . Wheezing, an apparent symptomatic expression of airflow limitation, is common in infants [44] . Notably, wheezing phenotypes also include transient wheeze [45] which is perhaps most analogous to phasic ASM contraction. An unanswered question is whether the established associations between adverse events in early life and asthma are mediated by a direct effect on airway function that may include persistence of or regression to phasic ASM contraction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 245, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 322, "end": 326, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 544, "end": 547, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 870, "end": 874, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 875, "end": 879, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 880, "end": 884, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 901, "end": 905, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 935, "end": 939, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1063, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1159, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1225, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are limitations and assumptions in both biological and computational models used in the present study. Sex is a potential confounder, particularly in the older groups. Males were only available in the 1-yr-old group, while 5-yr-old females were studied as these were the mother ewes of the younger groups. Younger groups comprised both male and female lambs. Recent studies have raised the possibility of sex differences in ASM behavior and the role of sex hormones in the etiology of asthma is acknowledged [46] . Indeed, there is a sex-dependent shift in asthma prevalence from childhood to adulthood; the prevalence of asthma is greater in boys than girls during early childhood, but this trend is reversed after puberty [47] . It seems less likely that sex differences will be expressed at the level of the isolated airway in vitro, where normal regulation from external stimuli is lost. For example, while male sex hormones increase airway responsiveness to cholinergic stimulation via a vagus nerve-mediated reflex mechanism, contractile response of isolated tracheal and bronchial ring segments to carbachol are not different between males and females [48] . No obvious differences were observed between males and females in the present study, further, any sex differences cannot explain a decrease in phasic activity with age.

We also did not specify the nature of cell-cell interactions which might include information flowing through gap junctions, calcium waves, or mechanical force-induced signaling that can lead to cell activation [19, 23, 49] . For example, when a cell is in the activated state, it may release mediators as well as produce localized force that can affect the activation state of the neighbor cell. These processes may take time which may in part be represented by the period associated with the refractory period T r . Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the ASM cell does not have a refractory period. To test the effect of T r on model results, we carried out various complementary simulations and found that T r \u00bc 0 was not different from T r \u00bc 1 suggesting that the refractory period is not an essential component of the model. Another simplification is the assumption that axial forces do not contribute to the expelled volume during a full airway contraction. Finally, the effects of the extracellular matrix were also neglected. Contractile forces can propagate through the collagen fibers to neighboring as well as more distal cells potentially influencing their activation. However, as the extracellular matrix strengthens during maturation [50] , its stiffness is expected to increase with potential effects on ASM phenotype and contractility.
