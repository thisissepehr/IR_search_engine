            "text": "The application of transgenesis has increased exponentially since its introduction in the early 1980s and is still one of the most powerful methods to study gene function. As approaches to solve scientific problems became more complex, transgene design evolved alongside. At this moment, the versatility in strategies and applications of transgenic animal models are both staggering and exciting at the same time. An attempt to give a fully comprehensive overview of all variations in transgene design described in the scientific press would be an illusion and exceed the aim of this chapter. Nevertheless, the strategy to generate a transgenic animal model (i.e., design of a transgene) warrants special attention to ensure the highest chances for success. Therefore, this chapter provides a concise overview of the elementary requirements of a transgenic construct and some considerations in transgene design. In addition, a number of aspects are discussed that may influence choices early on in the process of designing and generating a transgenic mouse model.",

Secondly, transgenes, including elements that control their expression, may either be fully derived from a native genomic locus or be assembled from genomic DNA or copy DNA (cDNA) and (heterologous) regulatory elements (see Subheading 1.2) . In addition, a range of regulatory systems offers a certain degree of control over transgene expression (see Subheadings 1.3 and 1.4). Size constraints, inherent to particular cloning systems, may limit the use of native regulatory elements: if a transgene becomes too large for regular plasmid or cosmid-based vectors, or when genetic complementation is desired (e.g., with DNA fragments spanning large genomic deletions), one can switch to systems that allow cloning of very large DNA segments (see Subheading 1.3; Chapter 9).

The origin of a transgene may range from prokaryotes (e.g., reporter genes such as \u00df-galactosidase) to worms or flies and higher eukaryotes like man. Human DNA is applied most widely to generate transgenes in experimental biomedical research. This choice offers several advantages. First, from a biomedical viewpoint, many known genetic disorders in humans have been mapped and extensively characterized at the molecular level: mutations or deletions have often been identified and mutant alleles are readily available (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . This makes it possible to generate transgenic models with \"diseased\" alleles and study structure-function relationships in the context of common (mouse) alleles. Second, despite structural divergence, most genes have been well conserved between mouse and man. This may become an important issue when, for instance, the biological activity of the (trans)gene product is dependent on protein-protein interactions or homodimerization. Such interactions may no longer occur between proteins originating from species that have diverged too much during evolution. It is possible that the (trans) gene product alters expression of the mouse homolog, either at a transcriptional, translational, or posttranslational (stability) level. Needless to say, these aspects are important, since they may all affect the outcome of experiments. Third, at a practical level, screening for founder mice generated by pronuclear microinjection,",

Structural differences between human and mouse genes make it possible to screen for transgeneity relatively easy. Primary sequence differences, often concentrated in noncoding regions (introns), provide a convenient way to discern between the transgene and the endogenous mouse gene by simple restriction endonucleases analysis. Sequence differences are not necessarily confined to noncoding regions but may also occur in coding regions (exons): the mRNA transcribed from the human transgene and that from the endogenous murine counterpart may differ in size and/or nucleotide composition. The latter may become useful in case size similarity hampers straightforward interpretation. If gene products differ at the amino acid level, Western analysis also presents a means to discriminate between endogenous and transgene-related expression, provided antisera are available that specifically detect the (trans)gene product. Alternatively, discrimination of the transgene-encoded protein can be easily accomplished by adding an epitope to the proteins' amino acid sequence, such as a synthetic Flag-, multiple Histidine (His), protein-derived tags (i.e., Hemagglutinin (HA) , c-myc) or virus-based tag (i.e., V5, PY -polyoma). In addition, follow-up studies such as immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP assay) and protein purification, may significantly benefit from such tags, in case the availability of immunological tools against the transgene product is limiting. Importantly, the effect of tag addition should be evaluated in vitro prior to embarking on in vivo experiments, as the addition of small peptide tags may affect protein function in vivo.",

Often, (part of) the first (noncoding) exon attached to a promoter is used in combination with coding sequences within a transgene; care should be taken that transgene translation starts at the intended ATG, and not in upstream heterologous exon sequences (see Subheading 1.3). Moreover, the effect of including introns in a transgene seems independent of its position within the transcriptional unit, although 3\u00a2-positioned splice acceptor and donor sequences have been known to result in aberrant splicing products. These observations suggest that recognition and processing by spliceosomes is instrumental in the observed upregulation of transgene expression. In addition, some endogenous introns appear to harbor regulatory elements with structural and functional similarities to enhancers, Locus control regions (LCRs), or Matrix attachment regions (MARs) (see Subheading 2.2) which direct transgene expression in a position-independent or cell type-specific fashion (9-17). Since regulatory regions are usually not cloned along with cDNA, these have to be provided \"separately\" and are most often not endogenous (1). Endogenous regulatory elements may be included when the DNA originated from a genomic clone (2) . The experimenter has a certain degree of freedom to tailor transgene design to specific requirements ((3); see also The choice of regulatory elements that drive transgene expression is broad (Fig. 2) , and is primarily determined by the aim of the model. However, in all instances, a number of indispensable elements that control gene expression need to be included in a transgene.",

The promoter region should comprise a Kozak/ ATG sequence at which transgene translation commences (see Subheading 1.2; (18)). If the expression pattern of a transgene needs to parallel that of the endogenous mouse gene, one needs to include native regulatory elements. Regulatory elements can be included that augment transgene expression, such as enhancers, which typically act in an orientation-independent manner. MARs, scaffold attachment regions (SARs), and chromosomal insulators are believed to insulate (trans)gene expression from the influences of surrounding chromatin (15) . LCRs confer position-independent and copy number-dependent expressional characteristics to a transgene. In addition, LCRs provide transgene expression at physiological levels, often with a cell lineagespecific enhancer activity. The application of LCRs in transgenesis is discussed in detail elsewhere (reviewed in (15) ). The advantage of including such elements in transgenes is obvious: whereas transgenes with \"minimal\" promoters may become inactive by the insertion into transcriptionally silent chromatin, transgenes carrying, for instance, LCRs will not. However, not all endogenous loci contain such elements and most often their position relative to coding regions within the locus is not known. If faithful reproduction of the endogenous expression profile is required (see also Subheading 1.4), without actual knowledge of the position of regulatory element within a transgene, there is obvious advantage in using large DNA segments as transgenes (see Subheading 1.3).",

            "text": "In the early days of transgenesis, it was often difficult to obtain faithful transgene expression patterns, i.e., which parallel expression of their endogenous counterparts, for a number of reasons (e.g., lack of knowledge in regard to nature and location of regulatory sequences of a locus; size restrictions of cloning systems). The use of a full-length relatively small mammalian gene (i.e., 15-20 kb), including 5\u00a2 and 3\u00a2 and internal regulatory regions, may yield faithful transgene expression patterns. In such a fortunate situation, not only coding sequences, but also cell lineage-specific and other regulatory elements are located within or close to the intron-exon structure of a locus. However, the exact location of elements that exert transcriptional control over a (trans)gene of interest need not always be known and often there may be many kb removed from the actual transcriptional start site. For a number of applications, like genetic complementation of large deletions and gene therapy, it is imperative to include such regulatory features in a transgene (19) (20) (21) . Fortunately, when transgenes become too large (i.e., up to 100-150 kb) for \"conventional\" plasmid-based cloning, a number of modern cloning techniques have overcome this hurdle: one needs to resort to cloning systems employing P1 artificial chromosomes (PAC), yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC), or bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) (see Chapter 9) . In addition, other cloning methodologies have been described to generate plasmids for biotechnology purposes, such as recombineering (see Chapter 11) . In principle, any gene can be cloned into these systems. Exceedingly large YACs (>500 kb) are transferred into embryonic stem cells first and via this route used to generate transgenic mice (see Chapter 9 ). An obvious and important advantage of using large stretches of genomic DNA is that with these systems the chances of obtaining cell lineage-specific, integration site-independent, and copy numberdependent expression characteristics are greatly improved (22, 23) .",

To ensure global and ubiquitous expression of a particular transgene, general-type promoters, such as those derived from histones, \u00df-actin, or housekeeping genes (e.g., phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)), but also viral promoters are often applied. Needless to say, if a heterologous promoter is chosen to drive transgene expression, one should adhere to those promoters that have been proven to function in vivo, or thoroughly test the novel system first. In the latter case, the experimenter should realize that in vitro expression characteristics of novel promoters may be very different than those in vivo.

In order to determine the minimal requirements for tissue-restricted expression of a particular promoter, it needs to be dissected at the molecular level. Classical promoter studies can be applied in vitro and in vivo to map the elements present within and surrounding a gene of interest. The promoter is tested in vivo by fusing it to reporter genes, such as \u00df-galactosidase, CAT, luciferase, or GFP. This approach is standardly used to examine spatio-temporal expression patterns and tissue specificity of native promoter sequences in vivo. To bypass embryonic lethality of a transgene or to study the effects of tissue restricted transgene (over)expression, tissue-specific, inducible, or combinations of these regulatory systems (binary transgenic systems) may be employed. Several binary transgenic systems have been developed, often employing prokaryotic expression control systems (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) .

Commercially available agarose gel extraction kit, such Qiagen gel extraction kit, may be used. Although optional, some laboratories apply Elutip-D columns for subsequent purification of DNA for microinjection, with very satisfactory and consistent results (see Subheading 3.1.4; Note 8). 1. Aside from promoter choice, the overall structure of a transgene has considerable influence on its activity. In eukaryotes, foreign DNA sequences (e.g., viral DNA, transgenes) are often methylated and inactivated as part of a host defense system against transcription of potentially harmful genes (39) (40) (41) . Although the exact mechanisms by which (trans) genes are transcriptionally silenced are not clear on all aspects, the presence of prokaryotic sequences (i.e., plasmid) should be minimized in a transgenic construct (the strategy (i.e., restriction sites) by which the transgene is released from plasmid sequences is a crucial part of the transgene design). In addition, it appears that the presence of bona fide intronexon structures in a transgene circumvents some of these problems (see Subheading 1.2).",

Breakpoints within the ABL locus are known to occur relatively 5\u00a2 within the first intron. The transgene harbors a heterologous (see Subheading 1.4) general-type metallothioneine promoter(24). The first BCR exon plus part of the first intron, which is fused (open arrow) to a short part of the first ABL introns and the second ABL exon, provide a splice donor (SD) and a splice acceptor (SA) site and preserve a simple but truthful mammalian intron-exon structure (see Subheading 1.2); an additional SD/SA pair comes from the ABL exon 2/intron 2 and intron 2/exon 3 boundaries. The main body of ABL exons, which spans about 32 kb, was cloned into the transgene as a cDNA segment. In this configuration, the transgene spans a mere 10 kb.
