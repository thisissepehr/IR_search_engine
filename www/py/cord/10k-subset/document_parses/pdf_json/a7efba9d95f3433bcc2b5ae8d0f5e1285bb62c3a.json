We show that the IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR represses mRNA translation and the rs4803217 allele modulates the extent of translational regulation. We analyzed the structures of IFNL3 variant mRNAs at nucleotide resolution by SHAPE-MaP. The rs4803217 G allele mRNA forms well-defined 3\u2032 UTR structure while the T allele mRNA is more dynamic. The observed differences between alleles are among the largest possible RNA structural alterations that can be induced by a single nucleotide change and transform the UTR from a single well-defined conformation to one with multiple dynamic interconverting structures. These data illustrate that non-coding genetic variants can have significant functional effects by impacting RNA structure.",

Studies on the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of liver disease 1 , have revealed a striking example of how human genetics affects the outcome of infection. Genome-wide association studies performed on diverse patient populations have identified polymorphisms near the interferon-\u03bb 3 (IFNL3; formerly IL28B) gene that predict the efficacy of interferon-based therapy for chronic infection. These polymorphisms are also strongly predictive of spontaneous HCV clearance during the acute phase of infection [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

This SNP was previously reported to regulate IFNL3 expression by changing seed base pairing with HCV-induced microRNAs 29 . We genotyped a large number of patients with chronic hepatitis C from the IDEAL Cohort 30 to evaluate associations of this variant with treatment phenotypes. Molecular analyses suggested that rs4803217 is functional in regulation of mRNA translation efficiency. RNA structure probing by SHAPE provided a physical explanation for these functional differences and revealed that IFNL3 mRNA structure is markedly altered by this common SNP. Together, these findings support a model in which IFNL3 mRNA translation efficiency, governed by allele-specific mRNA structures, modulates clearance of HCV infection.",

The most strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were rs12979860 in European-Americans and African-Americans, and rs8099917 in East Asians. These SNPs likely co-segregate with polymorphisms that directly affect biological functions related to IFNL expression or activity. To identify candidate functional variants in the IFNL3 gene region, we searched for variants in high linkage disequilibrium with rs12979860 (hereafter referred to as the 'discovery SNP') by analysis of available human genome sequence data (1000genomes.org). We identified a SNP (rs4803217) in the 3\u2032 UTR of IFNL3 that is highly correlated (best tagging SNP according to 1000 Genomes Project) to the discovery SNP [31] [32] [33] [34] (Fig. 1A) . The rs4803217 G allele is correlated with the protective C allele of the discovery SNP. This variant was an intriguing candidate as the source of viral infection-related phenotypes because 3\u2032 UTRs often contain cis-acting RNA elements that control mRNA translation and decay. Rs4803217 is also flanked by AU-rich elements (AREs; Fig. 1B ), sequence motifs that have been linked to post-transcriptional gene regulation 35 . Therefore, we conducted a large-scale genetic association study examining rs4803217 and HCV clearance in a cohort of chronically-infected patients.",

In contrast, the rs4803217 G and T IFNL3 reporter mRNAs showed distinct profiles across the gradient. Across three biological replicates, the G allele mRNA was more highly represented in denser gradient fractions, reflecting incorporation into polysomes, than the T allele mRNA (Fig. 2B ,C and Supplementary Figure S3 ). We quantified the areas underneath the lines for both G and T alleles and found that the allelic difference in area between polysome fractions (fractions 7-12) and non-polysome (fractions 1-6) fractions were significantly different (p = 0.01) (Fig. 2C ). This result indicates that the G allele mRNA was more abundant in polysome fractions compared to the T allele mRNA. Correspondingly, levels of non-translating mRNA (sedimenting between the 40S ribosomal subunit and the 80S monosome) were higher for the rs4803217 T mRNA. Figures 2B and S3 were quantified for both polysome fractions (fractions 7-12) and non-polysome fractions (fractions 1-6). The plot shows the differences in area between the G and T alleles (G minus T). Unpaired t-test (two-tailed) was used to calculate the P value from the three independent experiments (p = 0.01). Error bar represents the SEM. We did note that a significant amount (15%) of the T-allele reporter mRNA was found in dense gradient fractions (10) (11) (12) , suggesting that a portion of the T allele reporter mRNA escapes repression and is efficiently translated.

            "text": "rs4803217 alters structural conformation of the IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR. There is extensive literature linking 3\u2032 UTRs with translational control [see reference 39 for a recent review]. A growing body of evidence indicates that 3\u2032 UTR structure regulates mRNA translation and decay by modulating interactions with trans-acting factors 40 . Moreover, genetic variants that alter mRNA structure and function, termed RiboSNitches, have been described 41 . We directly examined whether the rs4803217 SNP physically modulates the structure of endogenously expressed IFNL3 mRNA using selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) 42 . We examined the structure of IFNL3 mRNA under non-denaturing conditions in the context of total purified cellular RNA. SHAPE analysis was performed on deproteinized RNA as this approach allows for direct assessment of mRNA structure independently of trans-acting proteins or RNAs. The structure of the IFNL3 mRNA was probed using the fast-reacting SHAPE reagent 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7) and products were analyzed by massively parallel sequencing using the SHAPE-MaP strategy 43 (Supplementary Figure S4) . We used human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells for these experiments because they express IFNL3 mRNA upon transfection with poly(I:C) (Supplementary Figure S5A) . Importantly, A549 cells are heterozygous at rs4803217 and levels of mRNA from each allele were directly correlated with the gene dosage (Supplementary Figure  S5B ). Using the MaP approach, sequencing reads derived from IFNL3 were sorted by SNP identity at rs4803217; this made it possible to examine the structures of both alleles under identical conditions in the same experiment (Supplementary Figure S4) . SHAPE data were collected on a 266 nt long region of the IFNL3 mRNA containing the last 125 nt of the coding sequence (including the stop codon) and the 3\u2032 UTR, excluding the terminal 23 nt and the poly(A) tail. SHAPE-MaP reactivities report a model-free measurement of the degree of RNA structure 42, 43 . The rs4803217 G allele had lower SHAPE reactivity, and thus more stable structure, near the region close to rs4803217 than did the T allele (Fig. 3A) . We next calculated Shannon entropy values for each rs4803217 allele. Shannon entropies are derived from a SHAPE-directed partition function and report a measure of whether an RNA region is likely to form a single well-defined structure [43] [44] [45] . The median Shannon entropies across the IFNL3\u2032 UTR were much lower for the G allele, especially near the rs4803217 site, than for the T variant ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figure S6) . We next performed a correlation analysis of SHAPE reactivities between the G and T alleles by calculating R 2 across the mRNA regions to address the overall structural similarity between the two alleles (Fig. 3C) . The SHAPE reactivities in the open reading frame (ORF) are highly correlated between alleles, and moderately correlated at the very end of 3\u2032 UTR. In contrast, a very low or zero correlation was observed in the region of rs4803217. This indicates that a drastic local change in structure is induced by the SNP. In sum, the G allele 3\u2032 UTR adopts an overall well-defined, highly structured conformation; whereas, nucleotide-resolution SHAPE probing indicates that the T allele adopts multiple conformations. In addition, structural differences between the two 3\u2032 UTR alleles are centered on the SNP region.",

Given its low Shannon entropy, the structure of the G allele could be modeled with a high degree of confidence, as evidenced by the preponderance of highly probable helices (Fig. 3D, bottom) . In contrast, the 3\u2032 UTR for the T allele is predicted to adopt multiple conformations, comprised of helices with base pairs of lower individual probability (Fig. 3D, top) .

In contrast, the U variant is not predicted to stably adopt this stem-loop structure (Fig. 4A) . We calculated the free energy change of 3\u2032 UTR RNA folding 48 for each allele and found that the rs4803217 G to U change alters relative free energy by approximately 7 kcal/mol. This difference in relative free energy is close to the largest possible increment achievable by altering a single base pair 49 . We calculated the expected free energy changes for all possible nucleotide changes in the context of the IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR (529 sequence variants) and in the context of the intact mRNA (2851 sequence variants). The increase in folding free energy due to the change from G to U at rs4803217 ranked the highest among all possible substitutions in 3\u2032 UTR, and the third among all possible substitutions in the intact mRNA, indicating that this position has a strong influence on RNA folding (Fig. 4B) . Direct SHAPE experimental interrogation and free energy increment calculations thus suggest that the rs4803217 SNP induces close to the largest possible change in RNA structure.",

Changing rs4803217 from G to C resulted in reduced expression, similar to the rs4803217 T reporter construct (Fig. 5B) . Restoring the predicted base pair in this mutant by introducing a G at nt 45 increased expression, consistent with RNA structure opposing repression. Interestingly, introduction of G at nt 45 (C45G) in the context rs4803217 G, which is predicted to interrupt base-pairing, had increased expression which was opposite of the effect on expression initially expected. However, this mutant resulted in a free energy of RNA folding similar to the rs4803217 G 3\u2032 UTR (Fig. 5B) by inducing a register shift in base pairing and ultimately preserved the stem loop associated with escape from repression 48 (Supplementary Figure S8) . For each of the constructs analyzed, the expression levels were inversely correlated with folding free energy. Together, the mutagenesis data further reinforce the model that the T-allele has a more variable structure than the G-allele mRNA and that stable structure is associated with enhanced HCV clearance.

Due to gene regulation at the level of mRNA translation, the modest differences in IFNL3 mRNA levels, as a function of genotype, reported in some studies may underestimate actual differences in IFNL3 protein levels, as we observed here for the IFNL3 rs4803217 SNP (Fig. 1) . This is consistent with a recent report of ~ 7-fold differences in IFNL2/3 serum levels between HCV patients who are homozygous at the discovery SNP 26 . Consistent with this work, a recent independent study identified a distinction between CC versus non-CC genotype (discovery SNP) for IFNL3 protein plasma levels 27 . However, we acknowledge that our results do not formally establish a causal relationship between rs4803217 and IFNL3 levels in patients.",

We discovered that the nucleotide at rs4803217 influenced the global structure of IFNL3 mRNA. The G allele was much more highly structured and the free energy difference between the G-and U-containing mRNAs was predicted to be close to the upper limit in structural stabilities achievable by a single-nucleotide sequence change.",

            "text": "The observed change in protein expression is likely the result of differential binding of trans-acting factors, induced by the differential folding of the 3\u2032 UTR variants. The SHAPE-derived secondary structures show that rs4803217 T reduces structure of a region overlapping ARE1 and 2 (Fig. 4A) , suggesting that unidentified trans-acting ARE-binding proteins may access these elements more efficiently in the T allele mRNA. Recently, McFarland et al. reported that the IFNL3 mRNA is regulated by AU-rich elements and also targeted by muscle-specific micro(mi)RNAs (miR-208b and miR-499a-5p) whose expression is triggered by HCV replication. These authors found that rs4803217 was functional using IFNL3 reporter mRNAs. However, the SNP did not confer regulation when ARE1 or ARE2 were mutated, in agreement with our observation that rs4803217 alters structural conformation of regions encompassing ARE1 and ARE2. With respect to the mechanism involving action of miRNAs, the rs4803217 T to G allele would disrupt miRNA-mRNA seed base-pairing 29 . Thus, the dramatic effects of rs4803217 on IFNL3 mRNA structure that we report here may regulate interactions with ARE-binding proteins and miRNAs. However, we note that, when the SNP position was mutated to a C, we observed a level of reporter expression similar to that of the T-allele (Fig. 5B) . The rs4803217 C mutation abolishes seed-region base-pairing to the proposed regulatory miRNAs, similar to the G-allele. This suggests that the regulation we characterized in HeLa cells, which may lack expression of the implicated miRNAs, is mediated primarily by effects of RNA structure on interaction with trans-acting factor(s) other than miR-208b or miR-499a-5P. Further study is needed to define the complement of relevant trans-acting factors that may differentially regulate variant IFNL3 mRNA transcripts through repression of translation and/ or induction of mRNA decay. Recently, RNA sequencing analysis of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) revealed transcriptional activity upstream of the IFNL3 gene that is coincidentally induced by treatment with poly I:C 36 . Moreover, a dinucleotide variant (rs368234815 TT/\u0394 G) in this region is associated with HCV clearance and may alter translation of a specific mRNA isoform encoding the novel IFNL4 36 . IFNL4 is antiviral against HCV in vitro yet is poorly secreted and does not appear to be strongly expressed in PHHs 15, 57 . In the rs368234815 \u0394 G genotype, which is predicted to express IFNL4 and is in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the non-protective (T) rs12979860 allele, IFNL4 production may exert effects that would be unexpectedly deleterious to HCV clearance 36 . Rs368234815 was recently reported to be more strongly associated with some patient phenotypes than rs4803217 in different patient cohorts, and thus may be dominant in determining HCV clearance in patients 37 . Further study is needed to understand the potentially maladaptive effects of IFNL4 expression and dissect possible interactions between rs4803217 and ss469415590 variants in control of HCV infection.",
