Primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma (PPSCC) is a rare malignancy; thus, a related PE is extremely rare. Case presentation: A previously healthy 49-year-old female patient was admitted to Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital owing to chest tightness, cough, and breathing difficulty that persisted for 3 days. Following admission, a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography revealed an embolism in the main pulmonary artery, upper and lower pulmonary artery branch. The patient was treated with alteplase, warfarin, and antibiotics. Over the following year, she experienced recurrent chest pain and tightness and breathing difficulty, with multiple CT pulmonary angiography revealing thrombosis in the right and left main pulmonary artery. No abnormalities were observed in surrogate markers of autoimmune diseases, tumor antigen testing, or ultrasonography; thus, the cause of recurrent PE was not identified. Subsequently, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination revealed diffuse heterogeneous thickening of the right pleura and substantially increased glucose metabolism. A CT-guided pleural biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the pleura eventually revealed a diagnosis of PPSCC. Conclusions: PPSCC is a rare tumor that lacks specific clinical manifestations and is difficult to detect with imaging techniques. The occurrence of PE as the primary manifesting symptom in a patient with PPSCC is extremely rare. Thus, malignant tumors should be considered in patients with no risk factors for PE and/or in those with recurrent PE.

Pleural fluid cytology for malignant cells is the simplest way to diagnose malignant tumors, but the diagnostic yield of pleural fluid cytology is low [19] . In recent years, PET-CT has been increasingly used to diagnose and stage primary malignancies [20] . Some reports have confirmed that a PET-CT can accurately distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, as pleural malignancy shows increased FDG uptake [20, . The gold standard for the diagnosis of a pleural tumor involves the pathological analysis of a pleural biopsy. Percutaneous CT-guided Tru-Cut needle biopsies are considered a superior diagnostic method. The reported rate of diagnostic sensitivity on CT guidance to target areas of pleural disease has been shown to increase the sensitivity to 87.5% [22] . However, thoracoscopy pleural biopsy is now widely considered the gold standard diagnostic modality with a diagnostic yield of up to 99% [23, 24] . Early detection, early resection, and thorough removal of tumors are important for the treatment of primary pleura tumors and prevention of recurrence. Total surgical resection is the best treatment for early PPSCC. As a minimally invasive procedure, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is the optimal method for the removal of early pleural tumors [25, 26] . Early PPSCC can be removed by VATS; if it is not possible to obtain the surgical margin of the tumor using VATS, the procedure should be converted to an open thoracotomy [27] . For tumors with unclear boundaries and suspected malignant pleural nodules, intraoperative frozen examination should be used to determine whether an extended resection should be performed to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve the prognosis [2, 25] .
