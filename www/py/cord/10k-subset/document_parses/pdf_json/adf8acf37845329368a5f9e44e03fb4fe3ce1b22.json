However, controversial results were obtained regarding the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. This study examines the role of IL-8 in the recruitment and activation of PMNs in the lung of pneumonia patients. The interesting aspect of this study is that it is a site-specific analysis of the infected and uninfected lungs of the same patient. The level of IL-8 mRNA, protein and myeloperoxidase present in the cells of the bronchioalveolar lavages (BALs) taken from the areas of known pneumonic consolidations on chest X-ray (infected lung) are compared with the BALs obtained from areas of no obvious infiltrate (non-infected lung). The results obtained from the infected and non-infected lungs of pneumonic patients were further compared with that of a control group of non-smoking patients. The level of IL-8 mRNA and protein were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. There was a significant increase in the level of IL-8 mRNA in the infected lung as compared to its level in the non-infected lung (p < 0.001). In correlation with the increase in mRNA, IL-8 protein concentrations in BAL fluids from the infected lung were 6 fold higher than those taken from the non-infected lung (p < 0.0001). This pattern was also consistent with MPO activity in the BALs (4.5 fold more MPO activity in the infected lung as compared to that of the non-infected lung), indicating that IL-8 is directly implicated in neutrophil accumulation that follows acute respiratory infection. The results of the present study, therefore, indicate the involvement of IL-8 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.

The accumulation and appearance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the tissue may be considered as an initial marker of acute inflammatory reaction [1] . Neutrophils participate in the host response to a number of infectious and non-infectious diseases and in leukocyte migration [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . They contain cytoplasmic granules that function in storage of bioactive neuromolecules (specific or secondary granules) or in fusion with phagosomes (azurophilic or primary granules). The azurophilic granules contain a variety of enzymes including myeloperoxidase, muraminidase, cathepsin A, D, E, G, 5\u2032-nucleotidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, elastase, collagenase, azurocidin and the defensins HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, arylsulfatase, \u03b1-mannosidase, N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, acid \u03b2-glycerophosphatase and cationic peptides. The specific granules on the other hand contain vitamin-B 12 -binding protein, neutral proteases, lactoferrin, alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme, and probably collagenase [7] . Although the mechanisms that regulate the release of substances from both the granules are almost the same, there are certain specific stimuli such as IL-8 and zymosan that induce the release of substances from secondary granules [8] .
