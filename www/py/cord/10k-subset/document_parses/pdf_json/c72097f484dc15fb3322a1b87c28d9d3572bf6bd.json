The human interferons (HuIFN) are formed by human cells naturally during life or in culture in response to various stimuli, especially a viral infection. There are at least 22 subtypes of HuIFNa, which have 70% of their 166 (or 165) amino acids in common, but differ in at least some biological properties (Finter 1991) . The single HuIFN{3 has many of the same properties as IFNa, and shares about 30% of the amino acids (the cytokine once termed IFN{3-2 is now classified as interleukin-6). There is one HuIFNw with 172 amino acids , which is chemically closely related to IFNa but antigenically quite distinct; it has not yet been separately tested in patients. IFN')' (formerly termed type 2 or 'immune' IFN) is a T cell Iymphokine which is very different from other IFN in its chemical structure and most of its properties, and has thus far been little used in viral infections. This review, however, will mainly consider results obtained with preparations of IFNa.",

Because of22 years of previous research on the virus interference phenomenon (Henle 1950) , the potential value of IFNs as antiviral agents for use in patients was realised as soon as they were discovered by Isaacs and Lindenmann (1957) . However, sufficient amounts of IFNs to allow clinical evaluation became available only in 1970, and were then nearly all used in trials in cancer patients. Indeed, IFNs have so far been used mainly in the management of some forms ofleukaemia and other types of cancer, but they are now increasingly being used to treat the chronic viral infections discussed in this review .",

As a result of intracellular processes that are still being elucidated, IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the cell nucleus are activated and a number of proteins are synthesised. These include the Mx protein and its human analogue (Weitz et al. 1989) , which have specific antiviral functions, and 2 enzymes, 2'-5'oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 A synthetase) and a protein kinase, which probably produce the general resistance of treated cells to viral infection (Hovanessian 1989; Pestka et al. 1987 ). This antiviral state reaches its peak some 6 or more hours after a cell is first exposed to an IFN, but once established may persist, though slowly waning, for many hours (table I) . To make IFN in amounts sufficient for clinical uses required human cells to act as the source in numbers that initially seemed almost impossibly large. The first solution was to use white blood cells obtained as a by-product from freshly donated transfusion blood (Strander & Cantell 1966) . When these were treated with a mouse parainfluenza virus, Sendai, they formed what was termed leucocyte IFN ( fig. 1 ). After partial purification, this product was used in almost all clinical studies until about 1979. Leucocyte IFN is relatively expensive and difficult to make and control, and even the cells from many thousands of individual blood donations yield only sufficient IFN to treat a few patients at a time.",

Other relatively common side effects include lassitude, fatigue, depression, leucopenia , thrombocytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes. These effects are dose related at least over the range from about I to about IOMU, but vary greatly in severity from one individual to another, some patients being intolerant of even a very small dose, whereas others accept relatively large amounts without difficulty.

As IFN induces a long-lived antiviral state in nasal epithelial cells in culture, this is surprising and suggests that mechanisms other than straightforward protection of the cells against rhinovirus may operate in vivo. The minimum effective dose is 2MU given once (Samo et al. 1984) or preferably 3 times (Phillpotts et al. 1983 ) per day, but a single larger daily dose of 5MU or lOMU is slightly more effective in reducing symptoms and virus shedding (Hayden & Gwaltney 1983; Samo et al. 1983; Scott et al. 1982) . In most protection studies against rhino viruses, IFNa administration was continued for 3 days after virus challenge. If IFNa was given after the symptoms of a cold had started, it had a minor effect on virus shedding, but the course of the cold was not changed (Hayden & Gwaltney 1984) .",

A small proportion of the many patients with such nongenital warts fail to respond even to repeated local treatments with a variety of conventional agents, with resultant great frustration to patient and physician alike. It has been shown in a number of studies that preparations of human leucocyte, Iymphoblastoid and recombinant IFNa and of IFNJ3 can be beneficial in such patients (e.g. Eron et al. 1986; Gibson 1986; Gibson et al. 1984; Niimura 1983) . The best regimen in terms of dose, route and frequency of administration, and duration of treatment remains to be defined with each of these, but experience with human Iymphoblastoid IFN suggests that intralesional administration is the most advantageous route in the treatment of severe and persistent skin warts (Gibson 1988) . A single injection of between 3 and 5MU into the base of the largest or most troublesome wart each week for 12 weeks gave an impressive rate of clearance (21 patients out of 27; 78%), and there was also improvement in both nearby and distant warts. Such intralesional injections are briefly painful, the extent depending on the site involved, and there are the usually mild Drugs 42 (5) 1991 influenza-like side effects associated with treatment with such a dose of IFN. Nevertheless, because there is no clinically detectable local tissue damage and the success rate is relatively high, this regimen has proved acceptable to most of the patients involved. Berman et al. (1986) reported mean responses of 86.1% in the treated warts of 4 patients given intralesional injections of 0.1MU of IFNa-2b, and 38.0% in 4 given placebo.",

In a placebo-controlled study with high-dose (35MU daily) IFNa for 12 weeks in patients with much earlier disease, antiviral effects were noted in terms of numbers of patients becoming HIV culture-negative (Lane et al. 1990 ).

The serum contains high levels of HBeAg, HBV DNA and DNA polymerase; there is little or no histological evidence of liver inflammation; and biochemical abnormalities are minimal. Most paediatric patients are in this phase . Since continued HBV replication usually has serious late consequences, as discussed below, it is logical to treat with an antiviral agent such as IFNa at this stage. IFNa may also help to break immune tolerance: if this occurs , whether spontaneously or as the result of treatment, cytotoxic T cells recognise the virus antigens and increased levels of HLA Class I antigens on the sur-Drugs 42 (5) 1991 face of infected liver cells and lyse them. If all are eliminated there is full recovery from the infection, but if HBV continues to replicate in some hepatocytes, these in turn are then lysed by the T cells, and progressive liver damage results. Thus, the prime objective of any treatment is to stop HBV replication, usually monitored in terms of the loss of HBeAg and other markers of virus replication from the serum, and sometimes followed by the development of anti-HBe antibodies; such changes are associated with loss of biochemical markers of liver inflammation and improvement in liver histology (Hoofnagle et al. 1981; Liaw et al. 1983; Perillo et al. 1990; Realdi et al. 1980 ). Suppression of virus replication will also reduce the infectivity of a carrier, a result particularly important for health care personnel and for women of childbearing age. About 90% of the offspring of carrier mothers who are HBeAg positive become carriers of hepatitis B virus , in contrast to only 8% of those born to HBeAg-negative carrier mothers (Oon 1988) .",

            "text": "In terms of criteria for choosing patients for treatment, there are 2 considerations. Theoretically, the earlier the patient is successfully treated in the course of the disease, the lower the number ofhepatocytes that will contain integrated HBV sequences. In a recent trial, about 10% of patients cleared both HBeAg and HBsAg, and were also found to be free of circulating HBV DNA as tested by the polymerase chain reaction (Perillo et al. 1990 ). However, the early immune tolerance phase of chronic hepatitis B virus infection is characterised by low serum levels of liver enzymes, and the levels of these are the best guide to the likely response to IFNa therapy: high levels of serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) are associated with an increased response rate (Hoofnagle et al. 1988; Perillo et al. 1990 ). It has therefore been suggested that only patients with serum ALT levels greater than twice the normal should be treated with IFNa (Hoofnagle 1990). Thus, the later in the course of the disease that a patient is treated with IFNa, the more likely he or she is to respond, but the greater the likelihood that there will by then be liver damage and that most hepatocytes will contain integrated HBV DNA, with a consequent correspondingly high risk of later development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The choice of when to treat with IFNa must therefore be made by balancing the likelihood of response against the not insubstantial cost of the treatment. It has been suggested that the response to IFNa is less in Asiatic patients, especially child-ren , than in Caucasians, but in more recent studies adult male Chinese have been shown to benefit (Liaw et al. 1988) . Patients with HIV infection respond relatively poorly (Me-Donald et al. 1987) . Successful IFNa treatment is clearly not a simple reflection of its antiviral effect. The virus is eliminated only following some change in the balance of the host immune response, the nature of which is not yet understood, and there remains the problem that the majority of patients do not clear HBV when treated with IFNa, perhaps because the antiviral effects of IFNa are blocked by the terminal portion of the polymerase protein , as shown in vitro by Foster et al. 1990 ). At present, there is no way of increasing the response above the 30 to 40% level seen in most of the clinical trials, even though a number of approaches have been tried. The most promising of these appeared to be the use of IFNa after pretreatment with steroids, but early reports of success with this protocol (Perillo et al. 1988 ) seemed not to be confirmed in a later study (Perillo et al. 1990 ). However, results from a recent study (Y.F. Liaw, to be published) suggest that this regimen can indeed improve the results in certain categories of patients. Chinese children treated with IFNa-2 who developed relatively high titre neutralising antibodies were found less likely to respond than those with low titre antibodies or none (Lok & Lai 1991; Lok et al. 1990 ).",

Within an 8-year period, the histological picture changes from one of chronic persistent hepatitis to chronic active hepatitis and finally to cirrhosis. These patients represent another category of patient urgently needing treatment. Here, the benefits of IFN treatment can best be assessed in terms of the total loss ofHBV DNA from the serum .

In a more recent study with IFNa given 3 times a week for 24 weeks, serum alanine aminotransferase levels fell to normal or near-normal levels in 28% of those who received a dose of IMU and in 46% of those who received 3MU; in the latter group there were improvements in liver histology, with regression oflobular and periportal inflammation. After the treatment course, about half of the responders relapsed (Davis et al. 1989) . In a similar trial in which the dose was 2Mu given 3 times each week for 6 months, 48% of the patients showed a complete response in terms of a normal geometric mean level of serum AST during the course of treatment; 33% had normal enzyme levels at the end of treatment, but at follow-up after 6 to 12 months only 10% had sustained this response (DiBischelie et al. 1989) . Several studies are in progress in which higher doses of IFNa are being given for longer periods. When lymphoblastoid IFN was given 3 times weekly at a dose of 3MU, the preliminary results showed a response in 5 of 7 patients (71%) at the sixteenth week of treatment (Jacyna et al. 1989 ).",

In contrast, as discussed in the preceding sections, IFNa preparations have proved of considerable value for the treatment of certain chronic viral infections affecting millions of people.
