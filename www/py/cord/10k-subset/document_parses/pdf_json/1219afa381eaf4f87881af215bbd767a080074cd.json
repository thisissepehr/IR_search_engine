Climate change may further exacerbate existing cardiovascular disease due to heat stress and higher exposures to airborne particles. 4 As was pointed out by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, 5 \"\u2026the ability to evaluate, track, and project health effects varies across climate impacts. For instance, health outcomes differ in terms of whether complete, long-term datasets exist that allow us to quantify observed changes, and whether existing models are able to project impacts at the time scales and geographic scales of interest. \u2026\" The USGCRP further acknowledged the need for data that can be used to characterize the impacts of climate change on human health.",

[6] [7] Research hypotheses and approaches will therefore also have to address the complications arising not only from the fact that climate change-related impacts will be situation-, chemical class-, location-, season-, and source-specific, 8 but will also be a moving target. Further, research approaches will be driven by temporal, geographical and data collection considerations. For example, melting of glacial ice may reintroduce persistent organic pollutants into the environment 9 resulting in higher levels of these chemicals in fish in Arctic diet; 10 exposure data needs for this issue would be geographically circumscribed and local entities may be appropriate for conducting the research. In contrast, geographic changes for vector-borne infectious diseases may require research over large areas (e.g., several countries) and include multiple research groups. Other types of predicted changes in human exposures related to climate change include: changes in exposures to pesticides and other contaminants in water used for irrigation associated with modifications to agricultural practices; 11 changes in fate and transport processes for chemicals and pathogens; 11 increased ozone exposures, allergen exposures, chemical exposures associated with wildfires, thermal extremes, exposures associated with extreme weather events, vector-borne infectious diseases, food-and water borne diseases, and exposure to harmful algal blooms; 12 and indoor and outdoor exposures related to dampness and flooding. 13 These exposures are unlikely to be temporally constant, but will rather continue to shift as the globe continues to respond to climate change.",

There is less research on the long-term health ramifications after the extreme event has struck a location, which can occur from weeks to years after the event has left an area. These negative outcomes can be due to a loss of infrastructure and public services, degradation of ecosystem services, loss of economic stability, damage to property, and destruction of facilities that contain or house hazardous material. 16, 17 Monitoring health outcomes of extreme events poses a variety of difficulties. 18 The interactions between extreme events and potential health impacts are affected by geography and landscape, response of local populations, and vulnerable populations. 19 This becomes especially difficult to monitor if the biological or chemical threats released by the extreme event are transported to locations away from the event. For example, heavy precipitation and flooding can quickly mobilize and transport contaminants to new locations causing hazards that can be overlooked by those monitoring or providing surveillance of health outcomes, because the contamination is outside the area being investigated. 20 Populations also move away from the impacted areas to escape the disaster or for economic reasons. 21 As these displaced populations can be difficult to track, monitoring health exposures and outcomes after an extreme event might not capture the full extent of the populations impacted.",

            "text": "Globally, record daytime and nighttime high temperatures have increased. Today, in the US, a record high temperature is twice as likely to be broken as a record low, and night time temperature records show a strong upward trend. 27 Increases in extreme heat may impact health in many ways, with effects ranging from hospitalizations for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases to mortalities and other heat-related illness, some of which are mediated through air pollution. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] To quantify the empirical evidence regarding heat exposures and impaired health, epidemiological studies have relied on different exposure metrics. Strengths and weaknesses of these metrics are briefly described here; harmonization of metrics to improve our ability to interpret heat-related exposure data is needed. Average temperatures: Average outdoor temperature, often used by epidemiologists to investigate heat-related acute health outcomes, 33, 34 include average daily, weekly or monthly temperature, or average of maximum daily temperature over week, months or season. Although these metrics may have excellent spatial or temporal coverage for short study duration and are very useful in the study of acute health outcomes, they represent weather as opposed to climate and provide no information on local climatology. Heat waves: Heat waves are commonly defined as a certain number of consecutive days exceeding location-specific thresholds. 35 Thus, frequency and duration of heat waves by definition address climate variability, whereas long-term changes in the patterns of these heat wave characteristics provide information on changing climate. One major drawback to using this exposure metric is frequency (e.g., heat waves are uncommon in substantial parts of the US) and inability to capture isolated days where high maximum temperature may have direct implications for health. Extreme heat events: Extreme heat events are calculated based on local climatology derived using a long baseline (usually 30 years). This metric overcomes the limitation of infrequency (such as in the case of heat waves), considers the local climatology of an area, can be specific to a time of year (day of year, calendar month, or season), and can be created from a baseline of relative (percentile value) or absolute values (measure of temperature) that show the change over a long period of time and responds well to large-scale climate phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. 36 Several data sources can be used to derive extreme heat-related exposure metrics. The CLIMDEX project has produced a suite of indices for the more extreme aspects of climate. The indices use daily temperature data from both gridded and station-based datasets and are used in global and regional research; 37 however, they are dependent on the operational schedule of observation stations and have a varying temporal scale. To our knowledge, none of the 27 metrics created by the CLIMDEX project have been used in epidemiological studies.",

            "text": "Climate change and exposure to infectious disease agents. A large number of infectious disease agents cause morbidity and mortality both in the US and abroad, including foodborne, water borne, vector borne, zoonotic, and soil-associated agents. In the US, the burden of illness caused by infectious diseases each year is substantial. Foodborne diseases alone, many of which have strong links to the environment, are estimated to cause 9.4 million episodes of illness, resulting in 55,961 hospitalizations and 1351 deaths. 41 Waterborne diseases are also important, with between 4.26 and 11.69 million annual cases of acute gastrointestinal illness attributed to public drinking water systems in the US. 42 Approximately 75% of all recently emerging infectious diseases in humans, including diseases such as Lyme disease, West Nile virus infection, SARS, and avian influenza originated in animals 43 with emergence often associated with ecological change. 44 Vectorborne diseases remain highly important in the US. The number of Lyme disease cases is estimated at 300,000 cases per year, 45, 46 and since its introduction in 1999, over 3 million West Nile virus infections have resulted in close to 780,000 illnesses. 47 Climate disruption has had a significant impact on the environment, and in future years will have an increasingly important role as a driver of changes in the ecology of these diseases, influencing both disease incidence and distribution. Severe storms, heat waves, and weather patterns have been linked to outbreaks of many environmentally-sensitive infectious diseases. West Nile Virus transmission intensity has been associated with warmer than normal summer temperatures. 48 Rift Valley Fever outbreaks in East Africa have been correlated with ENSO events. 49 Plague transmission in the Southwest and Rocky Mountain region has been linked to temperature and rainfall patterns leading to increases in wild rodent populations. 50 Waterborne disease outbreaks have been associated with heavy rains and also with drought conditions. [51] [52] [53] It is very challenging to link changes in transmission patterns of infectious diseases directly to climate change for multiple reasons. First, climate change takes place very slowly, requiring disease surveillance data to be collected systematically and consistently over many years. Second, meaningful correlations rely on multifactorial datasets consisting of both disease surveillance and weather data, collected over comparable temporal and spatial scales. For example, exposure to precipitation, soil moisture, and humidity could impact infectious disease research, particularly for respiratory and vector-borne diseases. Third, and perhaps most significant, climate is the only one of a multitude of possible ecological and epidemiologic factors that mediate disease risk in humans. 54 For example, it has been suggested that climate change and El Ni\u00f1o are contributing factors to the current Zika epidemic in the Americas. 55 Although this is within the range of possibility, attribution is particularly challenging without knowing the relative contribution of numerous other factors including global travel and the frequency and range of movement of infected humans, poverty and overcrowding, introduction of the disease into an immunologically na\u00efve human population, and limited public health resources in some affected areas. Progress is being made, however, in understanding how the multiple drivers of disease emergence work together and interact with weather patterns and trends associated with climate change.",

            "text": "DBPs and drought. Climate change will likely significantly affect our water resources. Climate change is already linked to prolonged and severe droughts in many parts of the US, notably in the Southeast and Western states. In addition to placing restraints on fresh water resources, droughts concentrate contaminants in rivers and lakes. Contaminants enter surface waters through several routes, including treated wastewater effluents, agricultural run-off and historical industrial activity, and during times of drought, these contaminants will concentrate in these surface waters; in fact, some rivers can become composed primarily of treated wastewater. Prime examples include the Santa Ana River in Southern California, which is 90% treated wastewater during the dry season, from April through October, 56 and the Trinity River in Texas, which consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent under base flow conditions. 57 In addition to contaminants, natural organic matter (NOM) and bromide and iodide (Br \u2212 and I -) salts concentrate in rivers during times of drought, 58 which will react with chlorine and monochloramine during drinking water disinfection to form hypobromous acid and hypoiodous acid, which in turn react with NOM to produce brominated and iodinated DBPs. 58 Because brominated and iodinated DBPs have greater toxicity compared to chlorinated DBPs, 58 the link between climate change-related drought and adverse human health effects is an important area of research for exposure scientists. In addition, many anthropogenic contaminants can react with disinfectants to form DBPs. 59, 60 Notable examples include iopamidol, a medical imaging compound, which reacts with chlorine to form the highly genotoxic DBP iodoacetic acid, 61 and the fungicide tolylfluanide, which reacts with ozone to form the carcinogenic DBP N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). 62 Drought also results in less desirable water sources being used for potable drinking water, including brackish groundwater and seawater, as well as reuse of wastewater. In fact, many coastal cities such as Hong Kong use seawater for toilet flushing, and disinfection of these waters can produce more toxic brominated and iodinated DBPs, which could adversely impact marine ecosystems. [63] [64] [65] [66] Wastewater reuse, which is less expensive than seawater desalination, is gaining public acceptance and has already been adopted in Singapore, as well as Orange County California, both of which use advanced treatment and recharge before potable use. In addition to droughts, climate change can also induce extreme weather events like floods, which result in more run-off of fertilizers, pesticides, NOM, and other materials that further complicate disinfection and DBP formation chemistry.",

Small sensors have utility in informing across many aspects of climate change effects, which include air quality, meteorology, water quality, human health responses, and others. Depending on hardware, some sensors can report measurements each second, though this is often at ineffectively high-method detection limits. Because sensors are low cost, easy to build and deploy, and are capable of producing prodigious quantities of data, caution is warranted in managing the large datasets that can be produced, and how to best address the voluminous information provided. Further, sensors rarely include robust quality assurance procedures, an essential component of any measurement. This is an important consideration of small sensor use where quality and precision of sensors vary greatly across manufacturer and technology, with some sensors observed to have a high degree of inaccuracy and imprecision. A significant open question to be addressed is calibrating and validating a sensor measurement; lacking this, the reported values are little more than an approximation.

It is likely not feasible in the short term (0-3 years) for individual laboratories, currently using only targeted methods, to consider routine application of NTA methods. However, steps can be taken now to ensure that NTA methods are viable for most analytical labs within the next decade. Widespread application of NTA methods will require effective leveraging of pooled resources-specifically, sharing of curated chemical libraries, mass spectral databases, authentic chemical standards, and data processing/analysis software. Official laboratory networks and research consortia will also be necessary to facilitate broad coverage geographically, temporally, and across media. With proper planning and communication, it is likely that new monitoring networks will be established within the US and worldwide within the next decade (see, e.g., the NORMAN Network: http://www.norman-network.net/). Exposure and climate scientists are therefore strongly encouraged to begin collectively considering how these NTA methods and monitoring networks can be used to test research hypotheses that link modifications in chemical exposure with changing climate. 81, 82 Methods for biological agents in indoor home environments. In a changing climate, it is anticipated that acute (e.g., hurricanes and flooding) and chronic (e.g., changing profiles in outdoor pollen and indoor allergens and microbes) events will affect exposures to biological agents in the indoor environment. 83 Indoor air often contains biogenic agents including bacteria, fungi, and allergens from plants (pollen) and animals (dust mites, insects, rodents and furry pets). 84 Microbial agents and pollens infiltrate homes from outdoors; once inside, microorganisms find surfaces that can provide nutrient and moisture sources sufficient for growth. On the other hand, animal allergens have exclusive niches inside the home because of the presence of the organisms from which they are derived.",

Although reporting the presence of a pet is straightforward, dust mite exposure assessment often relies upon dust sampling followed by immunoassay for the allergen(s) (Chew et al. 85 ). Air sampling is required for pollen grain and mold spore assessment; however, some allergen assays have been developed, which enable assessment of their allergen content in dust samples. 86, 87 In addition, researchers have focused on fungal fragments as a major source of exposure rather than spores or colony-forming units. 88, 89 Given that fungal fragments can remain airborne for longer periods of time, they could be a more constant source of exposure, which has been underestimated with traditional shortterm air sampling methods. Thus, long-term air sampling methodologies (e.g., electrostatic cloths that can either passively collect dust from the air or be used to wipe settled dust), which are easy-to-use and not burdensome to residents would be ideal. Also, having time-defined exposures throughout the year would capture changes in types and concentrations of pollens and fungi that might occur with climate change.",

            "text": "Indoor post-disaster exposure assessment after extreme weather events is often hampered by a lack of electricity, equipment, and trained technicians that can operate complicated sampling equipment. Recent advances in using electrostatic cloths to passively collect dust have overcome these limitations. 90 Further, the cloths can be collected and stored for long periods of time until resources become available to analyze them for indoor biological agents such as allergens or microbial agents. Another advantage of the electrostatic cloths is that they can be used to wipe television screens to actively collect dust samples once residents are able to move back to their homes. In conjunction with a data logger to measure how much time the television is being used, investigators could estimate \"time spent indoors\" in order to calculate dose (i.e., concentration per unit time). Heretofore, dose has not been commonly used in postdisaster exposure assessment of indoor biological agents; rather, concentrations have been used as proxies for exposure. 91 Researchers now have improved analytical options-with improved detection limits-for measuring biological agents in home environments. 92 For example, centrifugal filter tubes can be used to concentrate dust extracts, increasing the overall sensitivity of the method. Another advance includes the use of the halogen assay to quantify immunologically active allergen containing particles with very low sensitivity. 93, 94 Further technological advances that improve our ability to measure agents in indoor home environments include sensors that can both sample and analyze environmental chemicals such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For example, real-time VOC sensors have been developed to examine exposures to microbial agents. 95 Mold odor as reported by residents has been associated not only with asthma exacerbations but also with the development of childhood asthma. 96 Children spend most of their time in indoor environments 83 surrounded by building materials and furnishings that can sustain mold growth, 97 which leads to emissions of microbial VOCs (mVOCs) such as 3-methyl furan. 98 In addition, higher humidity levels in homes can lead to increased release of formaldehyde from building materials and furnishings. 99 As both formaldehyde and mVOCs are respiratory irritants, 100 detection at levels below the odor threshold of humans by realtime VOC sensors could permit the removal of hidden mold growth before the occurrence of substantial building damage or respiratory symptoms/disease.",

            "text": "For decades, the US military's public health and bioenvironmental functions have leveraged weather and climate monitoring in order to inform and mitigate potential environmental exposure risk to its personnel. All branches of the military have various internal programs to adapt and prevent heat and cold injuries. The Army for instance charges commanders with developing and implementing such measures and programs through its Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation 350-6. Since the 1950s, the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, or WBGT, has provided health officials with a relatively consistent measure of heat stress risk using a combination of temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar angle, and cloud cover measurements. 109 Currently, military installations employ single station WBGT observing platforms, which limit utility away from main bases. Monitoring is also often complicated by the fact that body armor and other gear can increase WBGT by 5-10\u00b0F. Efforts like those by the Army Research Laboratory to employ an algorithm-driven Hot Environment Assessment Tool (HEAT) based on conditions sensed using portable electronic devices (e.g., smart phones) along with potential future weather or climate prediction efforts to model WBGTs around the world enhance the military's ability to gauge heat stress risk. 110 The AFHSC collaborates with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, US Department of Agriculture, and other US Government and international organizations to monitor climaterelated infectious disease risks globally. 49, 111 Furthermore, from a strategic perspective, the DoD recently released its Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap (CCAR), which included recommendations for the Department to assess the effects of projected climate change on the distribution of disease vectors.",

In addition to advances in environmental exposure tools and surveillance mentioned above, weather and climate monitoring and prediction are key to the US military decision maker's toolkit in assessing personnel risk. To provide relevant climate situational awareness, the 14th Weather Squadron (DoD's largest climate center) leverages its Climate Monitoring, Analysis, and Prediction, or CMAP capability to monitor and inform AFHSC, bioenvironmental teams, commanders, and others on climate variability and long-term changes that could impact or exacerbate health concerns for US military personnel and those we support. Ultimately, a combination of exposure tools and models such as those mentioned in this section and others will help the US military gain a firm understanding of health risks posed to its personnel associated with changes in climate.",
