Our analysis revealed that the heterogeneous molecular diversity of disease chapters and the blurred boundary between disease categories in ICD should be further investigated. Here, we propose a new classification of diseases (NCD) by developing an algorithm that predicts the additional categories of a disease by integrating multiple networks consisting of disease phenotypes and their molecular profiles. With statistical validations from phenotype-genotype associations and interactome networks, we demonstrate that NCD improves disease specificity owing to its overlapping categories and polyhierarchical structure. Furthermore, NCD captures the molecular diversity of diseases and defines clearer boundaries in terms of both phenotypic similarity and molecular associations, establishing a rational strategy to reform disease taxonomy.",

            "text": "Disease taxonomy plays an important role in defining the diagnosis, treatment, and mechanisms of human diseases. The principle of the current clinical disease taxonomies, in particular the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), goes back to the work of William Farr in the nineteenth century and is primarily derived from the differentiation of clinical features (e.g. symptoms and micro-examination of diseased tissues and cells) (Council et al., 2011) . Despite its extensive clinical use, this classification system lacks the depth required for precision medicine with the limitations of its rigid hierarchical structure and, moreover, it does not exploit the rapidly expanding molecular insights of disease phenotypes. For example, many diseases (e.g. cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases) in the current disease taxonomies have either high genetic heterogeneity (Bianchini et al., 2016; McClellan and King, 2010) or manifestation diversity (Arostegui et al., 2014; Jeste and Geschwind, 2014; Mannino, 2002) , which give little basis for tailoring treatment to a patient's pathophysiology. Furthermore, disease comorbidities (Hu et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2008; Hidalgo et al., 2009) , temporal disease trajectories (Jensen et al., 2014) in clinical populations, various molecular relationships between disease-associated cellular components and their connections in the interactome (Blair et al., 2013; Goh et al., 2007; Barabasi et al., 2011; Rzhetsky et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2014) , and many successful drug repurposing cases (Li and Jones, 2012; Chong and Sullivan Jr., 2007; Ashburn and Thor, 2004; Wu et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2005) altogether demonstrate the vague boundary between different diseases in current disease taxonomies. Moreover, the deep understanding of diseases based on the advances in disease biology, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data necessitates the reclassification of disease taxonomy (Mirnezami et al., 2012) .",

Further insights will arise from integrating all types of biomedical data with a single framework to exploit diseasedisease relationships. Data integration methods that utilize multiple types of data, including ontological and omics data, have been used to classify and refine disease relationships (Gligorijevic and Przulj, 2015; Menche et al., 2015; Gligorijevic et al., 2016) . Despite these efforts, the development of a molecular-based disease taxonomy that links molecular networks and pathophenotypes still remains challenging Hofmann-Apitius et al., 2015; Jameson and Longo, 2015) .",

To achieve this, we first quantify the category similarity among the ICD chapters using ontology-based similarity measures and investigate the molecular connections of disease pairs in the same ICD chapters. Furthermore, we seek the correlation between category and molecular similarity, and check for the heterogeneity of molecular specificity and correlated boundary between categories in ICD taxonomy. Finally, we construct a new classification of diseases (NCD) with overlapping structures. The aim is to provide clear boundaries between distinct diseases belonging to different categories using a new disease classification scheme ( Fig. 1 & Fig. S3 ). Fig. 1 . Overview of the new disease taxonomy construction and validation. a. Similarity calculation between the disease pairs in ICD taxonomy, including the calculation of 1) category similarity; 2) Phenotype similarity (based on ICD-MeSH term mapping) and 3) Molecular profile similarities (based on ICD-UMLS term mapping) of disease pairs in ICD; b. Module or community annotations of disease association network by chapters in ICD or NCD. We generate disease association network, in which nodes represent diseases and the link weights represent their corresponding phenotype or molecule profile similarities. The module annotations of the disease network correspond to ICD chapters or NCD categories; c. Construction of integrated disease network (IDN) and generation of NCD. The links of IDN are fused from the multiple similarities (e.g. phenotype similarity and shared gene similarity). Based on IDN, NCD is generated by community detection algorithms with overlapping disease members; d. Quality evaluation and validation of ICD and NCD. The molecular specificity (or inverse molecular diversity) and network modularity are used for evaluation and comparison of the quality of two disease taxonomies. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of NCD with two independent phenotype-genotype association datasets, namely GWAS and PheWAS.",

Furthermore, although ICD-10 does have more codes than ICD-9-CM, the structure is kept almost the same. We obtained the high-quality phenotype-genotype (disease-gene) associations from Disease Connect database (2015 version) (Liu et al., 2014) , leaving out the less reliable text mining entries and focusing only on Genome-wide association study (GWAS), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and differential expression evidence types, and manually mapped those diseases in unified medical language system (UMLS) codes to ICD and MeSH codes (SM Section 1.6).",

For example, if two disease pairs have close positions (e.g. have a low level common parent disease) in the disease taxonomy, then we would expect that those disease pairs might have common genes or shared protein-protein interactions or similar phenotypes. We calculated the category similarity between disease pairs using a widely used semantic similarity measure (i.e. Lin measure using information content) (Lin, 1998; Pesquita et al., 2009) to represent the closeness of disease pairs located in the ICD taxonomy. Information theoretic measures such as information content have been used in the context of ICD-9-CM previously (Dahlem et al., 2015) . The category similarity measure takes as input two concepts c1 and c2 and outputs a numeric measure of similarity. If two ICD codes have a very specific common parent code in the taxonomic tree structure, then the category similarity would be~1.",

In this algorithm, we integrated the correlation between category similarity and module similarity with significant disease-chapter associations (which are based on the shared gene similarity) to predict the additional chapters for a given disease.

The principle of the algorithm adheres to the positive correlation between category similarity (or the closeness of position of the disease pairs in ICD disease taxonomy) and molecular profile similarity of disease pairs, which means that strong molecular profile similarity between disease pairs would indicate close locations of them in the disease taxonomy.

To reduce the possible noise and bias of disease related data sources, we applied a multi-scale backbone algorithm (Serrano et al., 2009 ) to obtain high reliable disease links (with significantly high weights than the random expectations) from the three disease networks. We finally obtained 53,241, 8554 and 134,370 high reliable links for MSDN, SGDN and HSDN, respectively and retained most nodes (1744 for MSDN, 1782 for SGDN and 1814 for HSDN) of these networks. To further reduce the possible weak associations (the disease pairs with high module similarity but no direct protein interactions) derived from module similarity, we calculated the minimum length of the shortest paths (MSPLs) between each disease pairs and used it as a filtering criterion (with MSPL\u22641) for MSDN, which resulted in a more biological meaningful subset of MSDN with 33,611 links and 1694 diseases.",

The modularity of these 17 top-level categories (this makes a good comparable partition with ICD chapters) in the network of 223 sub-categories is 0.426, which means a rather good partition of the network. These 17 NCs contain different numbers of sub-categories ranging from 4 to 25 or of diseases ranging from 53 to 369 (Fig. S11c & Data S10), covering diseases from all of the 17 chapters of ICD taxonomy (Table S11) .

If the diseases in such NCD sub-categories would tend to involve shared genes, then the diseases would be more likely associated with one another than other diseases. To test this hypothesis, we obtained the overlapping disease codes (ODC) in both NCD and the two external phenotype-genotype association databases and evaluate the degree of these ODC disease links in each NCD sub-category when considering two diseases linked if they share common genes. In detail, we firstly obtained the common disease codes involved in both NCD and UCSC-GWAS or PheWAS database. Then we generated a disease network with shared genes derived from the two datasets, in which two diseases linked if they shared at least one common gene. After that for each NCD sub-category, we generated a complete disease network with the ODC diseases in it and overlaid the network on the disease network with shared genes.

The category similarity distribution showed that most disease pairs (135,271, 87.52%) had similarities between 0.2 and 0.5 (Fig. S4a) . Disease pairs within this range mostly belong to different disease subcategories in the same chapter, such as diseases of other endocrine glands and disorders of thyroid gland.

The top two disease chapters with the highest median molecular diversity were Chapter 2 (3.87e-03) and Chapter 1 (1.31e-03) (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, we found that neoplasm (Chapter 2) and infectious disease (Chapter 1) categories tended to have higher molecular diversity compared to their complementary categories (Neoplasms vs. Non-Neoplasms p b 2.2e-16, Infectious diseases vs. non-infectious diseases p = 2.0e-02, Fig. S5b-c) and random controls. We also found that disease categories annotated as \"other/unspecified\" categories (SM Section 3.1) had higher molecular diversity compared to disease categories with specific conditions (p = 9.75e-03, Fig. S5d , Data S4; see SM Section 3.1) and its random control. These results indicate that the diseases in neoplasms, infectious diseases, and \"Other/unspecified diseases\" categories should be further investigated for molecular subtypes.

When we mapped ICD chapters as grouping annotations on the disease networks filtered by with appropriate weight thresholds, and calculated their modularity, we observed very low modularity values (Fig. 2e) . Since modularity is a widely used measure to validate the quality of partitions/module structures in complex networks, this means that the grouping of ICD chapters does not agree with the natural topological groupings of their corresponding molecular networks (disease modules). This finding gives strong evidence for the blurred disease boundaries of the ICD taxonomy, possibly arising from the complexity of the underlying molecular mechanisms, in particular the possible overlap of their respective subnetworks, or disease modules, in the interactome.",

We observed a strong positive correlation between category similarity and module similarity (see Methods, SM Section 5.1) of diseases, indicating that two diseases with higher module similarity would be more closely localized in the disease category (Fig. 3a, Here, we utilize the module similarity between disease pairs to predict the categories of similar diseases. In particular, we determine the taxonomic closeness (SM Section 2.1) of each given disease pair to predict the additional categories of diseases, by applying heuristic rules incorporating the positive correlation between category similarity and module similarity (see Methods, SM Section 5.1). In particular, using the 598,420 disease pairs with positive module similarity (Data S7), we generated 2057 predicted additional category results for 722 out of 1883 disease codes (38.3%) in which each disease code had~4 categories on average (Data S7&8). We found that the number of predicted categories positively correlated with the molecular diversity of the original disease codes (Fig. 3c , PCC = 0.547, 95% CI = [0.514, 0.578], p b 4.94e-324; for External validations see SM 5.2). This indicates that diseases with multiple pathogenic pathways could be captured by polyhierarchical mapping. For example, the 20 diseases in Chapter 8 (i.e. Diseases of the Respiratory System) have been predicted to belong to over five additional chapters, such as neoplasms, infectious diseases, and diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 3d) , which is consistent with the heterogeneous pathogenesis of COPD and asthma (Grainge et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2015) .

These findings demonstrate that our NCD framework has clearer boundaries between distinct diseases belonging to different categories than those in the original ICD disease taxonomy. Moreover, to validate the robustness of NCD predictions, we calculated the degree of associations in terms of network density among the diseases in each sub-category of NCD. To this end, we investigated the overlaps with the disease pairs connected by shared genes using two independent phenotype-genotype association databases, GWAS and PheWAS (see Methods, SM Section 1.2,1.6 & 8). We found that for the 223 sub-categories in NCD, network density was significantly higher compared to random controls (GWAS: p-value = 9.42e-197, Fig. 4j ; PheWAS:p-value = 1.31e-14, Fig. 4k ). This means that the diseases in the 223 sub-categories in NCD would tend to have shared genes. For example, the New Chapter: NC12 in NCD, including 11 sub-categories and 136 ICD diseases (belonging to eight ICD chapters), is enriched with respiratory and airway diseases (e.g. COPD and asthma).",

From the molecular network perspective, we first investigated the utility, shortcomings, and inconsistencies of ICD-9-CM, the established disease taxonomy for clinical settings. We found that there exist a considerable number (~40% of our investigated diseases) of diseases, for example, cancer and infectious diseases, that have diverse molecular network mechanisms and tend to interact more with diseases from other chapters. It is also these molecularly diverse diseases that mainly contribute to the blurred boundary of ICD disease taxonomy (see Methods, SM Section 4&7). Upon exploring the molecular diversity and cross-chapter interactions between diseases, we propose a novel disease classification system based on the integration of the clinical and molecular profiles of diseases. In particular, we integrate disease networks taking into account molecular and phenotypic connectivity among diseases, predict the multiple disease categories that diseases belong to, and finally validate the biological cohesiveness of our NCD by network topological measures such as modularity and shortest path length.",

            "text": "Our findings indicate that although general correlations exist between disease closeness in ICD taxonomy and underlying molecular profiles, ICD still displays significant limitations with regard to the heterogeneity of molecular diversity and clear category boundaries. In our NCD, a disease with a high molecular diversity tends to be classified into multiple disease categories, which indicates that there exist more disease subtypes for that disease. For example, \"malignant neoplasm of the pancreas\" was reclassified into 11 sub-categories and 4 NCs, which is consistent with a recent study wherein 4 phenotypic subtypes of pancreatic cancer were enriched for 10 distinct molecular mechanisms (Bailey et al., 2016) . Therefore, we believe that the new disease classification system may help facilitate precise clinical diagnosis and correct prognosis (Jameson and Longo, 2015) , and does so in alignment with refined molecular network diagnostics. Furthermore, the molecular network underpinnings and overlapping disease categories of NCD provide a credible relationship map between diseases and disease categories that may radically transform our current understanding of diseases and relevant treatment paradigms. On the one hand, our approach accurately links diseases with all possible underlying mechanisms in the molecular interaction network. On the other hand, it presents a promising approach to the identification of targeted drugs for the treatment of related diseases. For example, breast cancer and influenza (both in NC11.M02) may share potential drug targets (Park, 2012) . As another example, metformin, widely prescribed to treat metabolic syndrome (in NC11.M02), could alter the gut microbiome composition and function, improve gut microbial dysbiosis (Forslund et al., 2015; Cabreiro et al., 2013) , and also prevent colorectal cancer (also in NC11.M02) through microbiomeinfluenced immune response modification (Nakatsu et al., 2015) . Here, it is important to note that while a considerable number of diseases have a strong environmental component, our main focus has been the many diverse molecular determinants. In the future, additional environmental factors such as epigenetic changes can be added into the data integration scheme to further refine the classification.",

            "text": "There exist several potential limitations of this work. Although we have aimed to address the possible confounders by constructing random controls and using external evaluations, the incompleteness and bias incorporated in the integrated data sources are likely to influence the generalization of our results. For example, DiseaseConnect yields an incomplete disease-gene database: 1883 ICD diseases could be mapped (Table S11) , leading to only 1797 diseases included in the NCD. Furthermore, as with other studies that rely on literature-based and ontological knowledge, investigation bias remains an issue, where the molecular mechanisms (e.g. related genes and their interactions) of some diseases (e.g. cancer) being more intensively studied than others may influence the results . We expect the results of similar works to be more refined in the future as biomedical datasets become more complete. The incorporation of more comprehensive disease-gene data sources, such as DISEASES (Pletscher-Frankild et al., 2015) and MalaCards (Rappaport et al., 2017) , could result in an improved study. While we have chosen to keep individual external gene expression datasets outside the scope of this study since gene expression is highly tissue-and cell-type dependent, it presents an interesting future direction and could potentially improve the quality of the resulting disease categories if exhaustive lists of tissue-specific expression datasets are used in dedicated studies. In addition, our NCD merely delivers a two-level taxonomy framework without elaborated hierarchical structures in the same disease categories, which could be further refined or optimized through methods like hierarchical clustering algorithms (Murtagh and Contreras, 2012) and systematic posteriori ontology engineering method (Gessler et al., 2013) . Finally, high-quality ontologies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (Kohler et al., 2014) and Disease Ontology (Kibbe et al., 2015) , can be used for external validation, or for further integration to obtain more robust and extensive NCDs.",

At this point, a realistic assumption is that the translation of this classification to the clinic will need some time. That said, while Fig. 5 . Biological insights of new disease taxonomy. a. The New Chapter containing airway diseases (NC12) consists of 11 sub-categories and 136 ICD diseases belonging to 8 ICD chapters. The subcategories overlap in the underlying molecular interaction network, while still separately including the disease genes (asthma and COPD, respectively) that characterize each subcategory; b. The disease network of neoplasms in NCD. The 32 sub-categories significantly representing neoplasms are divided into 4 NCs (G1). Helicobacter pylori [H. pylori] (041.86), malignant neoplasm of stomach (151), duodenal ulcer (532), peptic ulcer, site unspecified (533), which have significant relationships, are clearly clustered into a subcategory (NC11. M07) (G2); c. A sub-category (NC06.M10) in NCD, which includes diseases from 8 different ICD chapters with shared molecular mechanism and phenotypes. Fifty percent (13/26 = 50%) of the diseases in NC06.M10 share a PPI module, the biological function of which is enriched with immune system response, while over 90% (25/26 = 96.2%) of the shared common phenotype of this module is \"Pain\". the ICD is originally made \"by clinicians for clinicians\", it is now widely used by biomedical researchers as well to gain a deeper understanding of human diseases. We therefore believe that researchers will be the first and direct beneficiaries of our approach.",
