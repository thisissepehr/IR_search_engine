Serotype, sequence type, clonality, antibiotic resistance genes and surface protein profiles of GBS are scarce in Ethiopia, a reason that this study was planned to investigate. . Methods: Sixteen colonizing GBS isolates obtained from recto-vaginal swabs of pregnant women and body surfaces of newborns were further analyzed. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, and whole genome sequence (WGS) methods were done for antibiotic susceptibility test, and molecular characterization of the isolates. Results: All the GBS isolates analyzed were belonged to four capsular serotypes: II, 11/16(68.8%), V, 3/16(18.8%), Ia and VI each with 1/16(6.3%) and five sequence type (ST-2, ST-10, ST-14, ST-569 and ST-933). Sequence type-10 was the most predominant ST followed by ST-569. The five STs were grouped into the four clonal complexes (CC -1, CC-10, CC-19, and CC-23). Different surface proteins and pili families such as ALP1, ALPHA, ALP23, PI-1 / PI-2A1, PI-1 / PI-2B, and Srr1 were detected from WGS data. All isolates were found to be susceptible to the tested antibiotics except for tetracycline in MIC and WGS test methods used. Tetracycline resistant determinant genes such as TETM and TETL / TETM combination were identified.

However, molecular profiles of GBS in many countries outside of these regions was not well documented [1, 2] . GBS causes early-onset neonatal disease (EOD) which is characterized by onset of clinical symptoms during the first week of life (0-6 days) following birth; it usually results in vertical transmission from colonized pregnant women to newborns during or just before delivery [3] . The other form of GBS disease appears in infants is the late-onset disease (LOD) -characterized by the onset of symptoms within 7 days to 89 days of age.

Another study conducted in Italy also revealed that the tetracycline resistance rate was 62/91 (68.1%), all resistant isolates harbored the tet(M) gene [21] . On the same way, resistant to tetracycline was observed in all 19 (100%) strains and 18/19 (98.0%) was correlated with presence of the tetM gene in a study carried out in Iran [40] . Tetracycline resistance is due to acquisition of tet determinant that encodes for antibiotic efflux or ribosomal protection in gram positive cocci [51, 52] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 236, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 391, "end": 395, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 574, "end": 578, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 728, "end": 732, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 733, "end": 736, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The limitation of this study was that the numbers of the GBS isolates sequenced were small.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitation"}, {"text": "In this study, the MLST data reveals that the study isolates are of different phylogeny and is suggestive of different clones circulating in Ethiopia.
