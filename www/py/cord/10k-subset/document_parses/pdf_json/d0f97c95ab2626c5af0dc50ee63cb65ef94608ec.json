In sucklings, infectious virus as well as specific antigen was first detected in the nasal mucosa at 12 hr, then in the nerve cells of the olfactory bulbs. At this stage viral particles were demonstrated both in the supporting cells and olfactory cells of the nasal mucosa. In the posterior part of the brain and spinal cord, virus was detected on days 3 to 4 postinoculation when viral growth was clearly demonstrable in the liver, spleen and intestines. In weanlings too, infection was first established in the nasal mucosa, shedding infectious virus in the nasal washing until day 6 postinoculation, and later infection spread to the brain and spinal cord. In weanling mice, however, neither infectious virus nor viral antigen was detected in the liver or other visceral organs, while serum neutralizing antibody became detectable on day 5 postinoculation, increasing in titer thereafter. Histopathologically degenerative and necrotic changes were observed in the nasal mucosa and central nervous system of both age groups of animals coincidentally with the presence of viral specific antigen, while inflammatory response was much less prominent in sucklings. In the liver, spleen and intestines, however, some lesions were observed only in sucklings.",

Sera were collected from 3 infected weanling mice at an interval of 1 or 2 days after virus inoculation. They were diluted in 2fold steps with MEM supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) (Difco, U.S.A.) after heating at 56 C for 30 min. To 0.5 ml of the serum dilutions were mixed equal volumes of a virus suspension containing approximately 200 PFU/ 0.2 ml. After incubation at 37 C for 45 min, 0.2 ml of the mixture was inoculated in triplicate on confluent DBT cells grown in 60-mm petri dishes. After 1 hr incubation for virus adsorption, the cells were overlayed with MEM supplemented with 10% TPB, 5% calf serum and 0.9% Bacto agar (Difco, U.S.A.). Two days later, cells were stained with neutral red (1 : 10,000) and developed plaques were counted 8 hr after staining. Neutralizing titer of the serum was expressed as reciprocal of the serum dilution giving 50% plaque reduction as compared to the control. As for suckling mice, sera were collected on day 5 from 5 animals, pooled, heated at 56 C for 30 min and assayed in the same manner as in the cases of 4-week-old mice. No infectious virus was detectable in the sera after inactivation.",

As shown in Fig. 2A , neutralizing antibody appeared on day 5 postinoculation which increased gradually in titer until the end of the experimental period. No antibody was detected in pooled sera of infected sucklings. Fig.  2A Histopathology At 12 to 24 hr postinoculation, degeneration and necrosis appeared in epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa and some necrotized cells were desquamated to fall into the nasal cavity (Fig. 4A ) in sucklings. At 36 to 48 hr some proliferation of nasal epithelial cells was demonstrable, and thereafter a regenerating process was clear, resulting in structural recovery on days 3 to 4 postinoculation. At this stage of infection, the olfactory bulb underwent degeneration and necrosis of nerve cells with hyperemia in the arachnoid. On days 5 to 6, these necrotized cells increased in number with proliferation of glia cells. Later, the other parts of the brain and spinal cord were involved. In the liver, a few small necrotic foci were seen on day 3, which increased in size and number on days 4 to 5 (Fig. 4B) . Inflammatory response at the necrotic sites was rather poor while a few monocytes were detected in some cases. At the same stage or later, some neutrophils were found in the red pulp of the spleen, and necrosis occurred in exocrine cells of the pancreas. Degeneration of the epithelium with accumulation of neutrophils was seen in the small and large intestines (Fig. 4C) .",

It was also suggested that natural infection of MHV in mice might presumably occur via the i.n. route (22) .

The virus titer increased logarithmically in this site, reaching a maximum at 36 hr postinoculation when viral antigen was densely distributed within the nasal epithelial cells as well as in the tunica propria. Numerous viral particles were observed in the epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa as well as in a space between microvilli of the epithelium, suggesting that MHV-S grown in the nasal mucosa and shed into the nasal cavity might be a source of transmission to other individuals. Concomitantly with viral growth, there were degeneration and necrosis in the nasal mucosa followed by a regenerating process. At this stage of nasal infection there was no significant viral growth in any other part of the body. Also, in 4-week-old mice, an immunofluorescent study and virus titration revealed that virus multiplied first in the nasal epithelial cells. Thus, the present study revealed that MHV did multiply and produce some lesions in the nasal mucosa in both susceptible suckling mice and resistant weanling ones, as suggested in our previous studies using MHV-JHM (9), although it had not been considered as yet that MHV can multiply and cause some histopathological changes in the nasal mucosa (1) .",

Also in rat coronavirus (RCV) and sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) infections, the epithelium of the nasal mucosa of the rat seems to serve as the initial target (3, 14) , as has been observed at the early stage of MHV-S infection in the mouse. However, RCV has a tropism to the respiratory system producing histopathological changes and SDAV to the salivary and lacrimal glands rather than the respiratory system. The 3 murine coronaviruses, MHV-S, RCV and SDAV, can be said to have a similarity in the tropism at the early stage of infection (3) . The phenomenon observed in MHV -S infection is also compatible with human coronavirus infection which involves only the upper respiratory tract (19) .",

This suggests that infection in the anterior part of the brain is transmitted to the posterior part through nerve cells, cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood stream, while there appeared no or little tissue damage in the meninges. Since infectious virus appeared in the liver on day 2, it is likely that the infection of the liver and other visceral organs is due to virus disseminated after multiplication in the nasal mucosa, although viremia failed to be detected. The virus grown in the liver may be liberated into bile and then into the intestinal lumen, where it may have a chance to infect the epithelial cells of the mucosa. At the last stage of infection, infectious virus was found also in the large intestine with some virus specific antigen or histopathological changes, although the titer was much lower than in the small intestine. From these findings, virus excreted in feces is supposed to be mostly derived from the liver or the small intestine. Transmission of MHV-S from the liver to the lumen of intestine has a similarity to that of human hepatitis A virus infection (4, 6) , although no viral multiplication in the intestines has been evidenced in the latter (5) .",
