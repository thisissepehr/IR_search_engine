Sexual contact networks should be scale-free to reflect the powerlaw statistical distribution of sex partners, but bipartite networks are more likely to accurately reflect needle sharing among injecting drug users (IDUs). Several network model types can be adopted, including daily contact networks that make use of individual activity records (Barrett et al, 2003; Stroud et al, 2007) or bipartite networks composed of individuals and most frequently visited places (eg homes, train stations, school buses, workplaces, restaurants) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 855, "end": 876, "text": "(Barrett et al, 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 877, "end": 896, "text": "Stroud et al, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Network-based epidemic simulations"}, {"text": "Data granularity and detail also affect network topology structures: if a disease control agency can trace all IDU activities, it is possible to use identified matches to build a relatively precise daily contact network.

Static demographic data (eg age, gender, profession, educational level, marital status) can be represented as the social network attributes of nodes. In addition to well-constructed and appropriate assumptions, individual movement and contact patterns require support in the form of demographic, geographic, and transportation data-for instance, average daily movement statistics for railway passengers between counties and cities, statistical distributions of family members per household in each county, numbers of employees in workplaces, and numbers of students in classrooms.

For example, Ferguson's Southeast Asian influenza simulation (Ferguson et al, 2005) uses statistical data for group density, household size, age distribution, school and workplace size, and individual travel information. The spread of HIV among homosexuals serves as a negative example-that is, movement, location, and means of sexual contact are less obvious, making it more difficult to build a network-based HIV epidemic simulation (Sumodhee et al, 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 190, "text": "(Ferguson et al, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 542, "end": 564, "text": "(Sumodhee et al, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Network-based epidemic simulations"}, {"text": "The four properties considered most important for building network-based epidemic simulations are:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Network-based epidemic simulations"}, {"text": "1. Time scale. In the case of HIV diffusion via heterosexual intercourse, frequency distributions of sexual behaviours over 1 month or 1 year show power-law distribution features (Schneeberger et al, 2004) , but the same is not true when the time scale is reduced to 1 day or 1 week. It is also important to remember that different diseases have different incubation periods (5 days for SARS versus 6 months to 20 years for HIV) and immunization periods. 2. Geographic scale. Care must be taken when selecting this scale. Whereas CASMIM can be applied to simulate SARS outbreaks in modern cities such as Taipei or Singapore, simulating multi-region epidemic dynamics requires additional demographic data. One possible solution is building a separate CASMIM for each city and measuring transportation flow between paired cities. For example, a new form of influenza tends to be expressed as a large-scale epidemic, therefore models for countries that have multiple regions require the consideration of cross-border transportation networks. Building a social network for any modern city with an established mass transportation system must assume a strong and varied mix of human movement, which can affect considerations of inter-regional transportation. 3. Data dependency. Data granularity determines the best method for building a network model. Using homosexual HIV diffusion as an example, a situation in which data are limited to frequency distributions of sexual contact restricts modellers to using abstract von Neumann and Moore neighbourhood concepts (Huang et al, 2005b) . However, if movement within a high-risk contact group can be traced, modellers can create simulations capable of predicting further development. 4. Extendability. Due to the diversity of data collected for epidemiology issues, simulations of specific infectious diseases often require modifications to existing network models. For example, the homogeneous mixing hypothesis used in random networks assumes that all members of a group are well-mixed (ie equal probabilities exist for contact between any two members), but data on sexual contact or needle sharing do not support this hypothesis. Therefore, extendibility is a major concern when applying an existing network model to new epidemic simulations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 205, "text": "(Schneeberger et al, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1579, "text": "(Huang et al, 2005b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Network-based epidemic simulations"}, {"text": "In the next two sections we will share our modelling experiences to construct network-based epidemic simulations.

Layer 1 addresses population contact within the same age group, with Susceptible, Exposed, Infective and Removed (S-E-I-R) statuses used as governing equations to simulate disease transmission. The Susceptible-to-Exposed transmission process begins with the initial transmission of a very small number of pathogens. During the early part of the Exposed stage, pathogens reproduce but remain below a threshold for active transmission to other Susceptible individuals. After a certain period in which individuals move from Exposed to Infective status, the number of pathogens becomes sufficiently large for transmission to other Susceptible hosts. Eventually the host enters the Removed stage in which it achieves a state of immunity or dies. Layer 2 addresses the difference in contact densities between two age groups. Layer 3 addresses regional commuting between population centres. We assumed that children and seniors are immobile, since the bulk of their activities occur close to their homes.

Prediction results are presented as the curves marked with squares: pre-2006 results were well above actual 2003-2008 HIV epidemic curves (eg 1047 cases predicted for 2003 compared to 861 actual) and post-2007 results were below the actual number (1782 versus 1935). Taiwanese health authorities initiated an HIV harm reduction policy in December 2005. Despite the low policy participation rate (30%), it exerted a strong positive effect in terms of bringing the HIV epidemic under control by reducing the number of new HIV-positive cases from 3386 to 2924 by the end of 2006. This represents the first decrease in the number of new HIV cases in Taiwan since 1986. A stronger harm reduction policy was activated in June 2006, Bipartite relations among injecting drug users (IDUs) and their meeting locations. resulting in a further decrease in the number of new HIVpositive cases to 1935 by the end of 2007.
