Arsenic trioxide effectively induces apoptosis in BCLL cells and shows selectivity for leukemic B-cells in respect to T-cells and normal B-cells of healthy age matched controls. The reason for this specificity profile is currently unknown but we believe that it is intricately linked to enzymes involved in the redox homeostasis of the cell.",

Not surprisingly, heat shock proteins and metallothionein were among the strongest upregulated genes. A striking number of RNAs coding for ribosomal proteins was downregulated especially after 18h reflecting a massive inhibition of the translational machinery during apoptosis. Additionally, the downregulation of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase I indicated an active downregulation of mitochondrial respiration during late apoptotic phase. Among the most downregulated genes we found the adhesion molecule CD24 and the B-cell marker CD79b which code for proteins enhancing the metastatic potential of malignant cells and a marker for trisomy 12 in CLL, respectively. Interestingly, many genes counteracting oxidative stress like thioredoxin reductase, glutathione reductase, peroxiredoxin 1, superoxide dismutase 1+2 and heme oxygenase were upregulated in all patients tested. The high number of upregulated redox relevant genes stresses the importance of oxygen radicals in arsenic trioxide mediated apoptosis in BCLL cells. We believe that the molecular mechanism making cells susceptible to As 2 O 3 can be targeted also by other substances interfering with radical detoxification. In search for such a substance which has synergistic effects with As 2 O 3 a library of 1500 compounds is currently screened. Background: Heat Shock Protein 32 (Hsp32), also known as Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1), has recently been identified as a stress-related survival molecule that acts anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective in inflammatory reactions. Recent data suggest that Hsp32 is also expressed in neoplastic cells in various malignancies.",

Expression of Hsp32 mRNA was demonstrable by RT-PCR, and the Hsp32 protein by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. In addition, we were able to demonstrate expression of Hsp32 mRNA and of Hsp32 protein in the CD34+/CD38-progenitor/stem cell fraction in the leukemic clone in patients with AML. The Hsp32-inducing compound hemin (10 \u00b5M) was found to promote expression of Hsp32 in AML cells. Incubation with the Hsp32-targeting drugs pegylated zink protoporphyrin (PEG-ZnPP) or styrene maleic acid-conjugated ZnPP (SMA-ZnPP), resulted in a dosedependent inhibition of growth of leukemic cells at pharmacologic concentrations (IC 50 : 5-30 \u00b5M for cell lines and primary AML cells). The SMA-ZnPP-induced growth-inhibition of AML cells were found to be associated with induction of apoptosis as evidenced by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and by a Tunel assay. In consecutive experiments, combination experiments were performed using SMA-ZnPP and AML cell lines. In these experiments, SMA-ZnPP was found to synergize with cytarabine in producing growth inhibition in all AML cell lines tested.",

NOTCH2 is implicated in the development/homeostasis of murine Cd5+ B1 B-cells, suggesting a potential function for human NOTCH2 in B-CLL leukemogenesis. Here we show that freshly isolated B-CLL lymphocytes (n = 30) express an activated form of NOTCH2 (N2IC) irrespective of their prognostic marker profile (ie. IgVH mutational status, CD38 expression, cytogenetics). Although the majority of cultured B-CLL samples downregulate their NOTCH2 activity within one day (24 out of 30), DNA-bound N2IC complexes could be maintained by the phorbol esther TPA (1 ng/ml) accompained by an upregulation of the NOTCH2 target gene CD23 and increased cell viability. These effects are sensitive to the PKC-d inhibitor Rottlerin. The PMA induced NOTCH2 activity was found to be resistant to the \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSI) DAPT and compound E in 24 out of 30 B-CLL cases suggesting that the vast majority of B-CLL cases express an activated form of N2IC which is not tethered to the plasma membrane and, thus, does not require \u03b3-secretase for signaling. NOTCH2 inhibition either by DAPT in a GSI sensitive B-CLL case or by siRNA mediated NOTCH2 gene silencing suggests a functional relation between NOTCH2 dependent CD23 expression and B-CLL cell viability. Retrovirally transduced N2IC rescues BL41-cells from B-cell receptor (BCR) mediated apoptosis, a mechanism thought to prevent the uncontrolled expansion of CD5 + B-cells. Thus, deregulated NOTCH2 signaling seems to be a common phenomenon in B-CLL and might be critically involved in the maintenance of their malignant phenotype.",

Deletion of p53 (del17p) can be detected in 5-15% of untreated cases with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and represents a negative prognostic factor of disease progression and therapy failure. The MDM2 gene encodes a negative regulator of p53. Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the intronic promoter region of the MDM2 gene (a T to G exchange at nucleotide 309) has been reported to increase expression levels of MDM2 leading to attenuated function of p53, and linked to the observed higher incidence of tumors in carriers with the homozygous G/G or heterozygous T/G genotype, respectively. We therefore investigated whether the MDM2 SNP309 genotype is also associated with onset or course of disease in B-CLL.

In Zukunft k\u00f6nnte eine multizentrische prospektive zentrale Datenerfassung wesentlich die Erkenntnisse \u00fcber die Erkrankungsverl\u00e4ufe von Patienten mit Karzinoiden vertiefen. Integrin adhesion molecules regulate many cellular behaviors, including cell migration, proliferation, differentiation and cell survival. Recently, CD98hc has been identified to mediate integrin induced signal transductions via direct CD98hc/ integrin beta cytoplasmic tail interaction. Cell adhesion is inducing integrin dependent focal adhesion kinase (FAK), src family kinases (SFK), Akt and Rho-GTPase phosphorylation and activation. Depletion of CD98hc expression or blockage of CD98hc / integrin complex formation impaired integrin induced signal transduction leading to an increase in Freie Vortr\u00e4ge Onkologie cell death and stop in proliferation. Furthermore, a genetic knockout of CD98hc in animals is embryonic lethal on E 3.5 to E 9.5. While cell adhesion in tumor cells is dispensable, the cytoplasmic domains of integrins have been shown to be essential to guarantee tumor cell functions. Consistently, it has been shown, that an overexpression of CD98hc in murine fibroblast show anchorage-independent growth, while a genetic knockdown in a teratocarcinoma model blocked tumor growth. In the present study we aimed to characterize the role of CD98hc in malignant diseases as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker, as well as to identify a functional role of highly expressed CD98hc in tumorigenesis. Therefore, we screened different renal cancer types in multi tissue arrays. While CD98hc is highly expressed in papillary renal cancer and in renal cell cancer (RCC), no CD98hc could be detected in oncocytoma or chromophobe renal tumors. Interestingly, CD98hc expression directly correlated with differentiation of renal cell cancer (grading). A retrospective study we correlate CD98hc expression in 120 RCC samples with respective patient data, which gives clear insights in a potential prognostic role of CD98hc expression in this disease. These in vivo immunohistochemisty data could be confirmed in a well defined cell line, Kaci2, showing high CD98hc expression, accompanied with a high proliferative phenotype. Using different strategies to interfere with CD98hc expression, like siRNA we could analyze the functional role of this protein in tumor cell behaviors like cell survival and proliferation. From this data we conclude, that CD98hc might represent guidance for the rational use of CD98hc staining in diagnostic/ prognostic histopathology. An understanding of the mechanisms how CD98hy mediates integrin-dependent signaling could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for oncology. Background: Recent evidence suggests that the addition of trastuzumab to antracyclin-containing combination chemotherapy increase the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced her2/neu positive breast cancer. Due to the overlapping cardiotoxicicty of trastuzumab and antracyclins there is an increased risk for cardiac side effects in the treatment of this patient population.",

Patients receiving an allogeneic HSCT were significantly less often classified as having \"proven\" IFI. Patients diagnosed with \"proven\" IFI and being treated with antifungal monotherapy significantly more often received treatment with (liposomal formulations of) Amphotericin B (26/147, 45%, p = 0.009), compared to patients having \"probable\" (18/147, 29%), or \"possible\" IFI (14/147, 35%). Antifungal therapy was significantly more often switched in patients with \"proven\" IFI (10/28, 33%) (p = 0.015), compared to patients with \"probable\" (15/28, 25%) or \"possible\" IFI (3/28, 7%). Fungus-related death significantly more frequent occurred in patients having \"proven\" IFI (19/22, 86%; p = 0.0), compared to patients with \"probable\" (3/22, 14%) or \"possible\" IFI Poster (0/22, 0%). Aspergillus fumigatus and terreus were the predominant cause of IFI in 151/167 cases (90%), followed by Candida species in 13/167 patients (8%). The overall mortality rate was 72.5% (121/167). Fungus related death occurred in 13% (n = 22). In univariate analysis, patients being diagnosed with \"possible\" IFI had a significantly better OS (3 yr OS: 100%; 95%, CI; p = 0.0) compared to \"probable\" (3 yr OS: 91%; 95%, CI) and \"proven\" IFI (3 yr OS: 53%; 95%, CI). By multivariate analysis, only being diagnosed with \"proven\" IFI turned out to be an independent risk factor for a dismal outcome (HR 1.67 (1.05-2.66), 95%, CI; p = 0.018).

Costs for combination therapy developed in a 7-fold accretion comparing \"older\" Amphotericin B/ Itraconazole (6,000 \u20ac) to the most expensive \"novel\" pairing lAmB/ Caspofungin (42,930 \u20ac).",

Schwarzmeier 1,2 , U. Jaeger 1 , M. Shehata 1,2 B-cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a disease of accumulation of clonal B cells which could be due to inhibition of apoptosis and long survival of the leukemic cells. This could be due to the activation of anti-apoptotic cascades through interaction with the lymphoid microenvironment. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of lymph-oid microenvironment in activation of the potent anti-apoptotic PI3-K/Akt signal transduction pathway and prolongation of survival of B-CLL cells. Stromal fibroblasts of bone marrow (BMFs) were used as an in vitro model for lymphoid microenvironment and to test their ability to inhibit spontaneous apoptosis of B-CLL. Co-cultivation of B-CLL cells with human BMFs significantly inhibited apoptosis of B-CLL cells. Trans-well culture experiments indicated that the supportive effect is provided by cell-cell contact and soluble mediators produced by viable fibroblasts. To explore the involvement of PI3-K/Akt pathway in the anti-apoptotic effect of stromal fibroblasts, co-cultures were performed in presence of PI3-K inhibitors (wortmannin or LY294002) or siRNAs against PI3-K (p110 subunit) and Akt1. These inhibitors significantly reduced the supportive effect of stromal fibroblasts and induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells. Induction of apoptosis was associated with a significant decrease in the intracellular PIP3, PI3-K, PDK1 and Akt1, NF-kappa B, IKK, and de-phosphorylation/activation of tumour suppressor protein PTEN. Studies using phosphospecific anti-PTEN antibody demonstrated that PBMC of CLL patients (n = 40) highly express a phosphorylated (inactive) form of PTEN. The results demonstrate that PI3-K/Akt pathway is involved in inhibition of apoptosis of B-CLL cells and suggest that interaction of the leukemic cells with lymphoid microenvironment maintains the activation of this pathway. The data also suggest that targeting this pathway represents a new therapeutic approach in B-CLL. Background: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is the most prevalent leukemia in the western world and is characterized as a monoclonal disorder with a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes. The search for tumorigenic stem cells in hematopoietic neoplasias has been initiated decades before and cells sharing stem-cell properties have been identified in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (AML, CML) and several solid tumors. Striking parallels can be found between cancer cells and stem cells regarding their capacity for long-term self-renewal. Signaling cascades such as the Wnt-, Sonic Hedgehog-, and Notch-pathway have been described to regulate self-renewal mechanisms during stem cell development and malignant transformation. Furthermore, various tumors have been shown to include side populations (SP) of stem-like cancer cells expressing on their surface membrane transporters of the ATP-binding cassette family (ABC-family) responsible for genotoxic drug resistance, another well-described property of stem cells.",

Since carcinogenesis is usually a multistep and multigenic process, it is unlikely that one single genetic polymorphism would have a dramatic effect on cancer risk. Therefore, single-gene studies are likely to provide limited value in predicting risk.

Interestingly, the incidence of the VH 1-69 gene that is commonly reported in the literature was lower than expected, while the V genes 4-34, 3-21, 3-7 and 3-23 together made up 36% of cases. The CDR3 regions of BCRs using VH 3-21 and 3-7 were highly conserved between B-CLL clones from different patients, suggesting a strong antigenic selection. Analyses of the HLA status of patients with V gene 3-21 and V gene 3-7 revealed distinct DRB1 alleles overrepresented in these groups compared to the allele frequency of the European population. Analyses of the TCR genes demonstrated expression of all 20 TCR beta family V genes in our patients. However, the TCR CDR3 size distribution pattern revealed a high frequency of oligoclonal/monoclonal T cells in the CD8+ T cell subset (over 50% of all TCR V genes analysed), while in the CD4+ population only around 10% clonality was observed. Additionally, clonality within the CD4+ T cell populations was more common in cases from unmutated CLL. In four patients with a rearranged BCR VH 3-21 gene we found T cell clones using the TCR BV 3 gene on both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. TCR sequence analysis demonstrated a conservation of the CDR3 regions between these T cell clones, suggesting a common antigenic trigger. VH 3-21 has been shown to be an independent prognostic marker in CLL irrespective of mutational status.",

Background: The intrinsic antiangiogenic protein vasohibin has been shown to be a negativ feedback-regulator of VEGF and bFGF signalling in human endothelial cells. It has been reported recently, that VASH1 acts specifically on endo-thelial cells. Therefore, VASH1 has been considered as a canditate for antiangiogenic therapies, but intracellular processing and secretion of VASH1 are still unknown, due to the lack of a classical signal peptide sequence in the protein. Moreover, a novel alternative splicing isoform (VASH1B) was studied for its antiangiogenic effects in comparison to the main VASH1 product (VASH1A).",

Age and FAB do have strong additional prognostic impact, while gender shows a differential influence, favouring in younger patients males and in older patients females. The age*FAB interaction represents much more pronounced risk differences between RA/RARS vs. RAEB/RAEBt/CMML in younger than in older patients. Cytogenetics as expressed by c-IPSS has strong prognostic impact, comparable in magnitude to that of FAB. Age and gender show weaker main effects, but marked interactions. The fact that prognosis based either only on the c-IPSS or only on age, gender and FAB is clearly less powerful, underlines that c-IPSS and the other considered characteristics add independent explanatory power to a prognostic model and therefore have to be considered jointly. Ergebnisse: Sp\u00e4testens 2 Stunden nach Beginn der Atemtherapie besserte sich der PaO 2 /FiO 2 Quotient auf Median 305 (229-480), die AF senkte sich auf 15/min (12-16) und spezifische Chemotherapie (Induktiontherapie/Reinduktion bei AML, VAIA bei Sarkom, Carboplatin/Docetaxel bei Adenocarcinom) bzw. antibiotische Therapie konnte fortgef\u00fchrt bzw. gleichzeitig zur Beatmung eingeleitet werden. Der Patient mit Agranulozytose erhielt Granulozytenkonzentrate, G-CSF und Breitspektrum AB-Therapie bei SIRS und transfusionsassoziertem Lungenversagen. Alle Patienten sprachen auf die krankheitsspezifische Therapie an und konnten nach 3 Tagen Median (1-6) von der nicht invasiven Atemtherapie entw\u00f6hnt werden. Durch rechtzeitigen Beginn der nicht invasiven Therapie wurde diese von den Patienten gut toleriert, und es musste kein einziger Patient intubiert werden. Von den Patienten mit akuter myeloischer Leuk\u00e4mie erzielten 2 Patienten eine komplette h\u00e4matologische Remission und sind zurzeit noch in Remission.

Background: Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction are generally regarded as the most important mechanisms by which p53 exerts its tumor suppressive effect. Two main targets have been identified in this respect: (1) p21 Waf1 , as an essential regulator of cell cycle arrest downstream of p53, and (2) PUMA, as the largest single contributor towards p53induced cell death. While deactivation of p53 in mice leads to a 95% incidence of tumors (71% thymic lymphomas) and death within 7 months, the loss p21 Waf1 or PUMA by themselves does not result in a tumorigenic phenotype. Thus, simultaneously disabling these targets may be required to recapitulate the p53-null phenotype in mice.",

Surprisingly, DKO mice are resistant to the development of spontaneous tumors, with only an 11% tumor incidence after 18 months of age, and none within the lymphoid system. Furthermore, the loss of both PUMA and p21 Waf1 protects mice from the development of thymic lymphomas following whole-body irradiation. Isolation of the lymphoid organs following whole-body irradiation demonstrated little loss of total cellularity within the thymus of DKO mice, again demonstrating, as with the exvivo thymocytes, their resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis.

Additionally, the p53-mediated induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to irradiation and DNA damage do not appear to be essential for tumor suppression. In DKO mice, thymocytes harboring DNA damage induced by radiation treatment are not cleared by apoptosis. Yet this pool of 'mutated' cells are unable to give rise to a tumor clone. Thus, significant and perhaps more important tumor suppression mechanisms still exist despite the loss of both PUMA and p21 Waf1 , or are activated because of it. The urokinase system has originally been implicated to assist the angiogenic process by it's proteolytic properties, thereby supporting new blood vessel formation in malignant diseases. It is now becoming increasingly evident that uPA additionally elicits many pro-angiogenic responses like differentiation, proliferation and cell migration in a non-proteolytic fashion via induction of intracellular signal transduction. Thereby, high malignancy in certain tumors has been shown to be accompanied by high levels of urokinase secretion.",

In contrast to canonical growth factors, like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), uPA elicits anti-apoptosis independently of the PI3-kinase pathway. uPA-induced cell survival is dependent on the type of extracellular matrix used indicating the involvement of integrin adhesion receptors. Thereby, uPA induces phosphorylation of the CDC42 downstream effector p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), which leads to IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKa) phosphorylation, a prerequisite for NFkappaB activation. Blocking NFkappaB by using the specific NFkappaB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 or by adenoviralmediated overexpression of its inhibitor, IkB, inhibits uPAinduced XIAP expression as well as uPA-induced cell survival.

Background: Yttrium-90 (Y-90) Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Zevalin) is a murine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody devel-oped for radioimmunotherapeutic targeting of CD20+ lymphoma cells. Using Zevalin, a localised cytotoxic radiation is administered to malignant cells with only minimal side effects on other organs.Methods: 38 patients with relapsed or refractory Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) were treated in this cohort. 26 patients had relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, 8 patients had relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 2 patients suffered from Immunocytoma and 1 patient had mantle cell lymphoma. The median age was 63 years. 35 patients were extensively pre-treated with a median of 13 prior therapy cycles (range 3-19). In 3 patients Zevalin was administered as first line therapy. The Zevalin treatment regimen consisted of pre-treatment with Rituximab (250 mg/m^2 intravenously on day 1 and 8) to deplete peripheral blood B cells followed by Zevalin infusion on day 8. A mean of 1067 MBq (range 680-2040) Y-90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Yatrics-Zevalin, Schering AG) was administered. Remission was evaluated 3 month after Zevalin therapy.Results: So far the response to treatment could be evaluated for 33/38 patients. The overall response rate was 76%. 58% (19/33) achieved complete remission/complete remission unconfirmed (CR/CRu), 18% (6/33) achieved partial remission and 24% (6/33) showed no or only minimal response to treatment (5/6 succumb to disease and 1/6 had progressive disease). The response of 5 out of 38 patients is not yet evaluated. 16 out of the 19 CR/CRu are still in CR/CRu with a median duration of response of 16 months (range 5-27).

This surface molecule has been involved in various processes such as tumorigenesis, haematopoiesis and inflammation. The standard CD44 isoform is expressed on all types of mature blood cells, on the majority of mononuclear bone marrow precursors and on all CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells. Changes in expression of CD44 have been shown during the early differentiation of primitive haematopoietic cells as well as in certain aggressive lymphomas. Elevated expression of CD44 has been reported from patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia (AML, CML) or a late form of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).",

Retinoid-X-receptor-alpha (RXR\u03b1) is the predominant RXR protein in myeloid cells. RXR\u03b1 is able to heterodimerize with other nuclear receptor (NR) family members or form signalcompetent homodimers. RXR\u03b1 partner availability regulated by intracellular RXR\u03b1 abundance is thought to determine NR signaling. However its regulation in primary neutrophil versus monocyte differentiation remained uncharacterized. Here we show that myeloid progenitors express RXR\u03b1 protein at sustained high levels during M-CSF-induced monopoiesis. In sharp contrast, RXR\u03b1 is downregulated during G-CSF induced late-stage neutrophil differentiation. Ectopic RXR\u03b1 inhibited G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation of granulocyte progenitors as well as their differentiation to late stage LF+ neutrophils in a serum-free culture model of CD34+ human progenitors. Furthermore, ectopic RXR\u03b1 was sufficient to redirect G-CSF stimulated progenitors to monocytes. In line with its elevation in monocytes, RXR\u03b1 failed to inhibit, but rather augmented M-CSF-dependent monocyte generation. Functional genetic interference with RXR\u03b1 signaling in hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells using a \"dominant-negative\" RXR\u03b1 promoted the generation of late stage granulocytes in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, downregulation of RXR\u03b1 protein is required for neutrophil generation. This differential regulation of RXR\u03b1 protein expression is determined by granulocyte versus monocyte cytokine signals.",

By contrast, transcripts for Flt-1, KDR, and Flt-4 were expressed variably in leukemic cells. In some cases, a correlation between VEGR expression and the type of leukemia was found. Likewise, in AML, KDR mRNA was found to be expressed primarily in blast cells in patients with FAB M4 (7/9; 78%) and M7 (2/2). Transcripts for KDR were also detected in 2/3 patients with mast cell disease, but were not detected in patients with CEL. Interestingly, Flt-1 mRNA levels were found in the patient with MCL and in the MCL cell line HMC-1, but neither in patients with SM or CEL nor in the CEL-related cell line EOL-1. Another interesting observation was that Flt-4 mRNA was expressed in neoplastic monocytes in a majority of all CMML patients examined (7/9; 78%).

Various antiemetic drugs are available for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). While conventional 5HT 3 -receptor antagonists obviously represent a major milestone in the management of acute CINV, prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting on days 2-5 requires repeat dosing. Palonosetron, a novel 5HT 3 -receptor antagonist, has both a longer plasma halflife and a higher binding affinity. With a single IV dose of 0.25 mg, Palonosetron provides an optimal prevention of acute nausea and vomiting and an improved efficacy in the delayed phase. The objective of this pharmacoeconomic analysis was to economically assess two antiemetic treatment options: palonosetron (0.25 mg IV d1) versus ondansetron (8 mg IV plus 8 mg PO d1 + 2 \u00d7 8 mg PO d2-5).",

Mutationen in der DPD f\u00fchren zu einer verminderten Enzymaktivit\u00e4t und somit zu einem verlangsamten Abbau von Pyrimidinen. Dies kann bei Patienten, die mit 5-FU oder 5-FU Prodrugs behandelt werden, zu schweren toxischen, im Einzelfall lebensbedrohlichen Nebenwirkungen f\u00fchren.Methodik: Von J\u00e4nner 2004 bis Dezember 2005 untersuchten wir 205 konsekutive Patienten mit verschiedenen Malignomen auf die DPYD-Mutation der IVS14+1G A. Es wurden alle Patienten gescreent, bei denen eine Chemotherapie mit 5-FU oder 5-FU-Prodrug geplant war. Von allen Patienten wurde vorher wurde ein schriftliches Einverst\u00e4ndnis eingeholt. Die Untersuchung erfolgte mit einer real-time-PCR mit der LightCycler\u2122-Technologie. Wir berichten \u00fcber die Wertigkeit dieser Screeninguntersuchung, in Bezug zu den aufgetretenen Diarrhoen, bei Patienten bei denen die Mutation nicht nachgewiesen wurde. Ergebnisse: Eine heterozygote DPYD-Mutation wurde bei 3 Patienten nachgewiesen, diese wurden nicht mit Fluoropyrimidine behandelt. Von den 202 Patienten ohne Mutation erhielten 139 eine pyrimidinhaltige Chemotherapie, 36 nur 5-FU oder Capecitabine, 103 in Kombination mit anderen Chemotherapeutika. Einundachzig Patienten (58 %) erlitten keinen Durchfall, bei 29 (40 %) kam es zum Auftreten leichterer Durchf\u00e4lle (WHO-Grad I u. II), schwere Diarrhoen (GIII u. IV) traten bei insgesamt 18 Pat. (13 %) auf. Es gab keine Todesf\u00e4lle, welche auf Durchfallerkrankungen zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren w\u00e4ren. Schlussfolgerungen: Bei 139 Patienten ohne DPYD-Mutation trat kein Todesfall auf Grund von Durchfall auf. Schwere Durchf\u00e4lle k\u00f6nnen aber auch bei Patienten ohne Exon14-Mutation nicht ausgeschlossen werden.

Alle drei Substanzen zeichnen sich durch unterschiedliche Wirkungs-und Nebenwirkungsprofile aus. Ein interdisziplin\u00e4res Expertengremium hat 2006 einen klinisch praktikablen Algorithmus zur rationalen Zweitlinienbehandlung erarbeitet. Docetaxel gilt weiterhin als eine Standardtherapie und kann auch bei eingeschr\u00e4nkter Nierenfunktion sicher eingesetzt werden. Pemetrexed weist bei gleicher Wirksamkeit eine deutlich geringere H\u00e4matotoxizit\u00e4t auf und hat damit bei H\u00e4mato-toxizit\u00e4t in den Vorzyklen oder bei erh\u00f6htem Infektrisiko eine bevorzugte Rolle.

Hinterberger Sozialmedizinisches Zentrum Ost, Donauspital, Wien, \u00d6sterreich Grundlagen: Die Prognose bei metastasiertem bzw. rezidiviertem Zervixkarzinom konnte durch verschiedene Therapieans\u00e4tze in den letzten 15 Jahren substantiell nicht gebessert werden. Zum Einsatz kommen in erster Linie Cisplatin, aber auch Carboplatin, Ifosfamid, Paclitaxel und Irinotecan zeigen Aktivit\u00e4t in diesem Krankheitsstadium. Der therapeutische Nutzen der \"targeted therapy\" bei dieser Tumorentit\u00e4t ist unklar. Methodik: Wir berichten \u00fcber eine Patientin, die 2 Jahre nach prim\u00e4rer Operation und nachfolgender konkomidanter Radiochemotherapie mit Cisplatin und 5 FU einen malignen Querschnitt durch Rezidivmanifestation L2/L3 mit tumor\u00f6ser Weichteilkomponente entwickelte. Nach Laminektomie und Bestrahlung und postoperativer Instabilit\u00e4t wurde bei nachgewiesener EGFR Expression eine Kombinationstherapie Irinotecan/Cetuximab durchgef\u00fchrt. Ergebnisse: Bei gutem Ansprechen konnte nach 2 Zyklen eine stabilisierende Operation durchgef\u00fchrt werden. In weiterer Folge konnte eine vollst\u00e4ndige Mobilisierung der Patientin erreicht werden. Nach insgesamt 6 Zyklen zeigt sich eine gute partielle Remission die bereits \u00fcber 3 Monate dokumentiert ist. Schlussfolgerungen: Die Kombinationstherapie mit einem Antik\u00f6rper stellt m\u00f6glicherweise eine Therapieoption bei metastasiertem bzw. rezidiviertem Zervixkarzinom dar. M. Huber 1 , W.

Classifications as well as age and gender may further confer prognostic information. This study evaluates the impact of cytogenetics by a Cox-model that simultaneously considers the inferences between the c-IPSS and age, gender and FAB. Main effects and interactions of these characteristics are estimated.Methods: In a series of 243 primary MDS patients treated with supportive care only, median survival was 31 mo and the median follow up 34 mo.The median age was 72 years (77 pts.<= 66 yrs, surv. 35.2 mo;166 pts. >66 yrs, surv. 31 mo). 124 patients (51%, surv. 29.5 mo) were male and 119 (49%, surv. 31 mo) female. According to the FAB classification the distribution and median survival were as follows: RA 74 pts. (30.5%), 68 mo; RARS 27 pts. (11.1%), 65 mo; RAEB 55 pts. (22.6%) 14 mo; CMML 62 pts. (25.5%), 25 mo; RAEBT 25 pts. (10.3%), 9 mo. According to the c-IPSS the distribution and median survival were as follows: low 153 pts. (63%), 61.3 mo; intermediate 49 pts. (20.2%), 24 mo; high 41 pts. (16.8%), 11.4 mo. The predictive importance was modelled by a Coxregression.",

            "text": "Background: Clinical practice does not always adhere to approved indications and accepted treatment guidelines or recommended schedules and regimes. Reasons therefore may be avoidance of expensive drugs, off-label use of registered drugs or treatment modifications due to comorbidities and toxicities. Moreover, expectations on the efficacy and tolerability of novel drugs based on published results from well-controlled clinical trials do not always stand the test of \"real life oncology\". Concerning drug safety, pivotal approval studies are notoriously underreporting rare toxicities and missing longterm sequelae. To investigate such important issues is a principal duty of the oncological community and can be properly evaluated by representative population-based surveys. Aiming this we have taken multiple myleoma as a paradigm malignancy and developed an internet-based IT infrastructure for a national myeloma survey (LACCITO). Besides providing a comprehensive view on the actual use of myeloma treatments, such a surveillance programme will provide an instrument for quality assessment of cancer care on a national level, generating benchmark values amenable to all participants and health care providers.Methods: Data will be collected cross-sectionally for all Austrian myeloma patients receiving any treatment in the 4th quarter of 2006 (retrospective T 0) and the 1st quarter of 2007 (retrospective T 1). 6 months onward (T 2) from T 1 an outcome inquiry on all pts. identified at T0 and T1 will be entertained, as well documentation of all new treatment decisions and additionally identified pts. At 12 months a second reappraisal on the whole cohort will be performed. Data will be analyzed using standard descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Maier estimates for disease outcome. Austrian hospitals and practicing hemato-oncologists will be invited to take part in LACCITO. This survey will be performed under the auspices of the OEGHO. The documentation form will be offered as a brief questionnaire on paper as well as by an internet-based data record form. A prototype registry developed at the Medical University of Innsbruck including myeloma therapies, risk factors, adverse events, response and survival data as well as basic health economic variables will be used for data collection. If requested participating centers and oncologists will receive support by a registry assistant for data extraction from source data files.Results and conclusions: The LACCITO project represents a cross-sectional survey designed to generate a \"real time\" report on the current therapeutic management of multiple myeloma in Austria. The data base will be further exploited for health economical analysis and health technology assessment (HTA). Methods: We report on 10 patients with mild to marked unexplained cytopenia without definitive signs of a myeloid neoplasm or criteria for an MDS. Cytopenia was observed for at least 6 months and was not attributable to any other underlying disease.Results: In one patient a thorough re-examination of the bone marrow revealed more than 10% dysplastic bone marrow cells, so that the diagnosis MDS could be established. In two patients, a karyotype-abormality (trisomy 14; monosomy 7) was detected in a small subset of bone marrow cells. Progression to overt MDS was seen in two of the ten patients, including the one with monosomy 7 in whom an increase in blast cells (8%) was found. In the remaining cases, no MDS developed in the follow-up. These patients were classified as 'idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS)', a term that has recently been proposed by Mufti and others.Conclusions: We recommend to use this term in all patients with unexplained cytopenia in whom minimal criteria for MDS are not met and no other underlying diseases, that could cause cytopenia, are detected. In addition, we recommend a long term follow-up in order to document or exlcude a prephase of MDS. Background: About 2-3% of all colorectal cancers occur in the context of the autosomal dominantly inherited Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC Lynch syndrome), which is due to mutations in mismatch repair genes. It is of vital clinical importance to diagnose index patients with cancer potentially due to Lynch syndrome. Genetic councelling and testing should be offered to family members. Given certain genetic predispositions, life-long preventative care would be indicated, especially, at focus on colorectal carcinomas, but also with a view for detecting other localizations (endometrium, urothelium, ovaries) . The problems associated with the diagnosis of HNPCC are to be demonstrated on the basis of one of the world's largest documented HNPCC-family, including 51 members over 4 generations.Methods: Because of clinical suspicion for HNPCC, the index patient was analyzed for mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 by direct sequence analysis. A causal mutation (+1343 A>del) was detected in exon 12 of MLH1 gene. Concordantly, putative carriers of this mutation were genotyped.Results: 10 family members carrying the mutation were found, four of them developed a colorectal carcinoma , one of them 3-fold metachronic. Moreover, particularly striking is the age of the person diagnosed (39 years), under controlled circumstances, with an early-stage tumor localized in the coecum and one person who deceased very young (28 years with a sigmoid tumor). There are indications of anticipation in successive generations. The variety of HNPCC tumors is also displayed in the cases of two family members, who had a carcinoma of the stomach, duodenum and endometrium.Conclusions: The primary HNPCC diagnosis by clinical recognition and genetic testing of the index patient plays an essential role in the early detection of these tumors within a preventative care program.",
