The incidence of NEC is reduced when infants are fed human milk. However, in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), it is standard practice to freeze and/or pasteurize human milk, which deactivates bioactive components that may offer additional protective benefits. Indeed, our pilot study showed that one feed of fresh mother's own milk per day was safe, feasible, and can reduce morbidity in preterm infants. To further evaluate the benefits of fresh human milk in the NICU, a randomized controlled trial is needed.",

Infants in the intervention (fresh human milk) group (n = 1549) will receive at least two feeds of fresh human milk (i.e., within 4 h of expression) per day from the time of enrollment until 32 weeks' corrected age or discharge to home. Infants in the control group (n = 1549) will receive previously frozen human milk following the current standard protocols. Following informed consent, enrolled infants will be randomly allocated to the control or fresh human milk groups. The primary outcome is the composite outcome mortality or NEC \u2265 stage 2 at 32 weeks' corrected age, and the secondary outcomes are mortality, NEC \u2265 stage 2, NEC needing surgery, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), weight gain, change in weight, increase in length, increase in head circumference, time to full enteral feeds, and finally, the number and type of critical incident reports, including feeding errors.",

Between May 1, 2015 , and April 28, 2018, we found that the incidence of mortality in infants born at < 30 weeks' gestation at 25 hospitals in China was 25%, and the incidence of NEC was 6.2% [Siyuan Jiang, MD, written communication, October 2018]. Elsewhere, the overall mortality from NEC was reported to range from 15 to 30%, with more severe cases of NEC resulting in a higher mortality rate. For infants who survive, a significant risk exists for long-term complications and morbidity, including impaired neurodevelopment [1, 2] .",

Human milk contains both nutritional components (e.g., proteins, amino acids, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals) and bioactive components (e.g., live immune cells, cytokines, hormones, and growth factors) that have antimicrobial and antiinflammatory properties [6, 7] . More recently, Hassiotou (now Kakulas) et al. [8] showed that human milk is a rich source of pluripotent stem cells that, when ingested by the infant, enter the blood stream and are incorporated into the major organ systems of the infant. Although their exact function still remains unknown, breast milk stem cells possibly benefit the infant through actively participating in growth and/or regeneration. The current evidence strongly suggests that fresh human milk may have a significant protective effect against both infection and NEC [9] .",

The use of formula in low birth weight or very preterm infants was reported to increase the risk of developing NEC when compared with donor human milk [10] . Although human milk, either mother's own or donor milk, appears to be the best feeding source for the nutrition, immunoprotection, and development of the preterm infant, current practices related to the handling and use of human milk in the NICU raise questions about whether we are deriving the maximum benefit from its use. Currently, in many NICUs worldwide, milk expressed by mothers of preterm infants is frozen and stored prior to use. When the infant requires oral feeds, frozen milk is defrosted and warmed, fortifier is added as needed, and the milk is then fed to the infant. Freezing human milk at either \u2212 20\u00b0C or \u2212 80\u00b0C and for longer times decreases the energy content and amount and bioactivity of several important components of human milk [11, 12] , including the fat, carbohydrates, secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, antibacterial factors, and antioxidants [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In addition, defrosted human milk does not contain any live stem cells because they have a half-life of approximately 4 h and die when human milk is frozen and/or heated [8] .",

In addition, following freezing, human milk shows lipid peroxide formation [45, 46] .

Some guidelines recommend that preterm infants are fed pasteurized mother's own milk because of the potential risk of contamination by CMV. However, this may be unnecessary considering that if a mother is CMV positive, the infant already will have been exposed to CMV in utero. We will address this concern in our study by requiring every neonate admitted to the NICU to be tested for CMV and pasteurizing infected milk before use.",

Furthermore, excess oxygen can secondarily lead to retinopathy of prematurity or chronic lung disease in preterm infants [45] . NEC, intraventricular/periventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity are all thought to be consequences of the imbalance between antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress [50] . Previous studies reported that human milk has important and essential antioxidant components, which may prevent and protect against diseases in infancy [45] . Human milk feeding remains an essential tool to help in the protection against free radicals, oxygen reactive species and oxidative stress, with fresh human milk having been reported to have the highest antioxidant activity [45] .",

To minimize the potential bias from families leaving the study, we will use intention-to-treat analysis. If applicable, we will also conduct regression adjusted for propensity score estimated based on the infant and NICU characteristics available. Last, in China, approximately 17% of infants born preterm per year are discharged against medical advice and die at home. These infants will be included in our intention-to-treat analysis.
