He had rapid neurologic decline and his clinical course was complicated by refractory seizures and malignant brain edema. He was managed with oseltamavir and peramavir, corticosteroids, intravenous gamma globulin treatment, anticonvulsants, intracranial pressure management with external ventricular drain placement, hyperosmolar therapy, sedation, and mechanical ventilation. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasal secretions confirmed 2009 H1N1 virus infection; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for 2009 H1N1 viral RNA. Follow-up imaging demonstrated improvement in brain edema but restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia. We provide a review of the clinical spectrum of neurologic complications of seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1, and current approaches towards managing these complications. Conclusions 2009 H1N1-associated acute encephalitis and encephalopathy appear to be variable in severity, including a subset of patients with a malignant clinical course complicated by high morbidity and mortality. Since the H1N1 influenza virus has not been detected in the CSF or brain tissue in patients with this diagnosis, the emerging view is that the host immune response plays a key role in pathogenesis.",

On the 6th illness day, he presented to the emergency department of a community hospital with lethargy and confusion. He was electively intubated for airway protection. His chest X-ray (CXR) was normal. Routine admission laboratory tests including hepatic transaminases were within normal range. A non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) did not reveal any abnormalities (Fig. 1, top row) , and he underwent lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 53 WBC/ll with 91% lymphocytes, 6 RBC/ll, protein 113 mg/dl, and glucose 59 mg/dl. He was diagnosed with meningoencephalitis and started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and oseltamivir (150 mg twice daily per nasogastric tube). On the morning of the third-day of hospitalization, he experienced tonic-clonic seizures and remained comatose with extensor posturing afterwards. Repeat head CT (Fig. 1 , bottom row) demonstrated diffuse brain edema and effaced basal cisterns. He received fosphenytoin, mannitol, and propofol.

On arrival, his initial examination demonstrated a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3 (E1V1M1). His repeat CXR did not demonstrate On the bottom row, the small arrow points to effacement of basal cisterns (left) and subcortical brain edema (larger arrows, bottom row, left and right). This subcortical edema is confirmed on MR imaging (Fig. 2) any infiltrates or signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). An external ventricular drain was placed by the neurosurgeon at the bedside. He reported that the CSF pressure noted at the time of initial catheter placement was elevated. The first recorded intracranial pressure (ICP) was 10 mm Hg, and this reading was taken after the expected loss of CSF during the procedure. On the second day of NICU hospitalization, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 4 (E1V1M2) and average ICP was 7 mm Hg. Throughout the remainder of the hospitalization, the recorded ICP remained below 20 mm Hg. Initial ICP was maintained with external ventricular drainage at 0 cm relative to the external auditory canal and a midazolam infusion (5 mg/h). Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring demonstrated diffuse, severe slowing in the delta range and no electrographic seizures. On hospital day 3, MRI of the brain was obtained (see Fig. 2 ). He received 20 days of dual neuraminidase inhibitor treatment (oseltamivir 150 mg twice daily per nasogastric tube, peramavir 600 mg IV daily); intravenous gamma globulin (1 gm/ kg 9 2 days); dexamethasone (10 mg IV load, 6 mg IV every 6 h with taper over 4 weeks); ICP monitoring and management; ventilator support; and anticonvulsants (fosphenytoin, levetiracetam). His weekly Glasgow scale scores showed delayed improvement (3, E1V1M1, admission): 5 (E2V1M2, week 1), 5 (E2V1M2, week 2), 5 (E2V1M2, week 3), 9 (E3V2M4, week 4). The midazolam infusion was discontinued on hospital day 4, after clinical observation and EEG confirmation that he was not having electrographic seizures. Thereafter he received intermittent doses of lorazepam as needed for sedation while on the ventilator. Over 3 weeks, neuroimaging demonstrated improvement in his brain edema with restoration of his basal cisterns, and the external ventricular drain was successfully weaned and removed. More rapid weaning of his external ventricular drain was not attempted due to severe neurologic impairments with GCS less than eight and radiographic appearance of diffuse brain edema and effaced basal cisterns.",

Below the mucosa, the free nerve endings of the olfactory nerves may also become infected. As seen with Herpes simplex viruses, some postulate that influenza virus could penetrate and replicate at the olfactory mucosa and the free nerve endings with resultant axonal transport of virions to the olfactory bulbs, to the olfactory tract, and finally to the brain [15] . There is some literature to support this mechanism when one looks at H5N1, or avian influenza, where mice inoculated intranasally with H5N1 developed CNS lesions in the pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellar nuclei. Astrocytes and glial cells were positive for viral antigen but viral replication ceased before 7 days [16, 17] . Further study is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of CNS disease complicating influenza A infection.",

The degree of encephalopathy varies from a confusional state to obtundation. It is important to recognize that a small portion of cases can rapidly deteriorate to coma and subsequent brain death due to diffuse, malignant cerebral edema. Focal and generalized seizures often occur and can be present with either mild or severe cases. The presence of fever and altered mental state should prompt clinicians to pursue CSF analysis unless neuroimaging or laboratory studies reveal a contraindication. Influenza illness may include upper respiratory symptoms, pneumonia, or diarrhea (more commonly in young children with seasonal influenza). A thorough medical assessment to exclude other causes such as sepsis, metabolic or toxic disorders, structural CNS diseases, and other CNS infections is warranted. We define encephalitis by the presence of inflammation in the CSF or demonstration of viral infection in brain biopsy or autopsy specimens. We define encephalopathy when CSF is acellular and brain biopsy or autopsy specimens have failed to demonstrate viral infection. In some cases, this distinction is arbitrary and the case has borderline CSF pleocytosis or CSF analysis was not performed due to malignant brain edema. A consistent observation is that patients with seasonal influenza-associated encephalopathy rarely ever have evidence of influenza viral RNA in CSF based on RT-PCR analysis of CSF. Furthermore, there is no evidence of seasonal influenza virus infection of brain specimens. In one case series, only one out of 18 patients with acute seasonal influenza-associated encephalitis had influenza viral RNA detected [5] .",

For example, the International Pediatric Multiple Chronic condition * Sometimes classified as ADEM [18] Sclerosis study group [18] listed ten terms that have been used to describe acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Some terms focus on the triggering event, such as post-infectious encephalomyelitis; others on pathologic or pathophysiologic features such as acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis or hyperergic encephalomyelitis. These authors also classify acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leucoencephalitis (also known as acute necrotizing encephalitis, (ANE)), and acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis as hyperacute forms of ADEM. These diagnostic terms are of great historical interest. They generally preceded modern neuroimaging and relied more on the clinical and pathologic details. The study group also lumps a diversity of neuroimaging findings under the diagnosis of ADEM including: ring-enhancing lesions; diffuse and multi-focal regions of T2 hyperintensity with and without associated hemorrhage; multi-focal lesions with associated mass effect (tumefactive lesions); and images with symmetric, bithalamic edema. While we prefer one term (ADEM) rather than ten terms to describe post-infectious encephalitis, we are concerned that the pathophysiology and outcome of a process leading to the formation of ring-enhancing lesions (demyelinating, for example, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis) must be radically different than that causing bithalamic edema (necrotizing, for example, ANE). In reality, IAE presents along a spectrum ranging from milder cases with normal neuroimaging to more malignant cases with abnormal neuroimaging and less favorable outcomes. For the sake of discussion and literature review, we present a simplified classification scheme based on clinical and imaging findings.",

Like our patient, their case also showed confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale. Because of the additional finding of microhemorrhages demonstrated on gradient echo MRI sequences, they diagnosed acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis or Hurst disease. Their patient also had restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia (see Fig. 2 ). Because their patient had severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with oxygen saturation readings in the range of 70-80%, the authors attributed the basal ganglia findings to hypoxic brain injury. Our patient did not have advanced pulmonary disease, hypoxia, or hypotension.",

Monitoring for respiratory compromise due to neuromuscular weakness with timely respiratory support if needed is critical. Plasmapheresis or gammaglobulin treatments are also helpful.
