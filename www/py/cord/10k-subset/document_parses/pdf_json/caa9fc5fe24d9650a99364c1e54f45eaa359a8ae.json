The two distinct terms appearing in this expression represent the contributions due to infected individuals in the same community (c) and in the other community (c ), respectively. Notice that for 2 interacting populations, as considered in the main paper, we can reduce the number of independent equations from 12 to 10 by exploiting density conservation within each population, i.e. Z Z (c) = 1, where Z (c) denote the fraction of individuals in state Z and community c = 1, 2.

In order to generate modular networks with n C communities and adjustable community strength, we first group nodes into n C different communities. Here we chose for simplicity to assign exactly N/n C nodes to each community. Each node receives a random number of open connections drawn from a Poisson distribution with averagek. We then classify each of these connections as either a within-community or an inter-community stub with probabilities 1 \u2212 and , respectively. Links are finally created by matching stubs. Withincommunity (between-community) stubs are matched with each other according to a configuration model. We eventually discard self-links, multiple links between any pair of nodes and unmatched stubs. For large networks, the number of discarded stubs is usually negligible compared to the number of links. Notice that this algorithm enables us to independently set both the degree distribution and the strength of the community structure.",

At the same time, a naive susceptible can also be infected by either B 1 or B 2 . To avoid co-infections with B 1 and B 2 , we loop over the neighbours of the naive node in a random order, checking for each infectious neighbour node if infection occurs or not (according to the corresponding infection probability, i.e. either \u03b2 1 or \u03b2 2 ) and stopping iteration at the first successful infection event.

We stop simulations 400 time steps after either B 1 or B 2 becomes extinct, or, alternatively, after reaching the maximum simulation time T max . The former stopping condition is dictated by the need to discern simulations where A is able to persist from those where it becomes extinct right after extinction of either one of the B strains. When any of the stopping conditions is met, we check which pathogens have survived and the corresponding prevalence.

In (a) we can observe two types of transitions in the behaviour of X A : the sharp transition at \u03b4 c = 0.5 corresponds to a leap from state [A&B 2 ] to state [A&B 1 ]. As \u03b4 c is further increased, extinction of A becomes increasingly probable as the state [B 2 ] is reached with a higher frequency. This transition is, however, gradual and around \u03b4 c = 1.3 a crossover is reached where states [A&B 1 ] and [B 2 ] are reached with equal probability. Other parameters are as in figure 6 .",
