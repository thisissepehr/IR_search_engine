We hypothesize that the fivefold difference in the rate of microcephalic neonates between the NE and other regions is partially an effect of the population prior immunity against Dengue viruses (DENV), that cross-react with ZIKV. In this ecological study, we analysed the interaction between dengue fever epidemics from 2001 to 2014 and the 2015/2016 microcephaly epidemic in 400 microregions in Brazil using random-effects models under a Bayesian approach. The estimated effect of the time lag between the most recent large dengue epidemic (>400/100,000 inhabitants) and the microcephaly epidemic ranged from protection (up to 6 years prior) to an increased risk (from 7 to 12 years). This sustained window of protection, larger than described in previous longitudinal studies, is possibly an effect of herd immunity and of multiple exposures to DENV that could boost immunity.",

            "text": "One of the reasons that made it possible for researchers to associate the microcephaly epidemic in the Northeast (NE) region of Brazil with the Zika virus (ZIKV) was the high rate of dispersion of the virus and the large number of babies born with similar characteristics in the same maternity wards, in the same week, and sometimes even in the same day. This repeatedly happened in different cities of the region in a short time 1 . Despite all the research done on the first epidemics of ZIKV in Yap Islands and later in French Polynesia [2] [3] [4] , it was only after the Brazilian epidemic that Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) was described 5 . This could be due to the small population in the previously affected areas and to the large number of births concentrated in the same hospitals of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Even so, a robust analysis using secondary databases estimated a peak of 49.9 microcephaly cases per 10,000 live births in the NE region, whereas for the other regions the peak did not surpass 10 cases per 10,000 live births 6 . So far, microcephaly ratios as high as in the Brazilian NE region have not been described in any other region in the world that had undergone a Zika epidemic [7] [8] [9] . Several reasons for this discrepancy were suggested -poor data quality [10] [11] [12] , the unreliability of secondary data sources 13, 14 , virus genetic variation 15 , socioeconomic factors 16 , dengue immunity profile of the population 17 , and women postponing pregnancy or having abortions [18] [19] [20] . The antigenic similarity between ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV), sharing approximately 54% of their amino acid envelope proteins, results in immunological cross-reactivity 21 . In vitro studies have shown that anti-DENV antibodies can both enhance and neutralize ZIKV infection [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . In animal models, mice that received plasma with a low level of anti-DENV antibodies had a higher mortality rate after ZIKV infection than mice that received plasma without antibodies. However, all mice that received plasma with a high level of anti-DENV antibodies survived after ZIKV challenge and presented milder symptoms 22 . Human plasma collected \u2264100 days after PCR-confirmed DENV infection binds and cross-neutralizes ZIKV in vitro. On the other hand, late-convalescent-phase plasma does not harbour durable, high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV 27 . However, the understanding of cross-neutralizing antibody responses among individuals with prior DENV exposure, particularly how these responses evolve over time and in various transmission contexts in flavivirus-endemic countries is quite unknown 28 .",

The second random-effects component was an independent and identically distributed Gaussian random effect by microregion. Vague priors were used and the inference was done under the Bayesian approach using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) 32 . To evaluate the time lag between the microcephaly epidemic and a previous dengue fever epidemic, we assessed several rate thresholds (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and statistical distributions (Supplemental Material). The best fit, according to the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) 33 , was obtained with the zero-inflated Poisson model and 400 cases per 100,000 inhabitants as the threshold of a dengue epidemic.",

It should be noted that the notification system for Zika was only implemented in February 2016, when the Zika epidemic was decreasing in the NE region. Therefore, we could not control for Zika incidence in the models. It is possible that the differences in microcephaly rates were a consequence of different ZIKV attack rates across the regions, as suggested in a recent paper 37 . In this study, after testing for other concurrent factors, ZIKV was assumed to be the only cause of the microcephaly epidemic, with no unmeasured confounders or effect modifiers. However, if Zika incidence alone explains the excess microcephaly rates, then microcephaly would simply be a proxy for Zika, and it remains unclear as to why the NE region would have presented with a Zika incidence more than ten times larger than anywhere else in Brazil 37 .",

This hypothesis is based on what is described for sequential heterotypic DENV infections (there are four DENV serotypes). It has been established that a narrow range of pre-existing anti-DENV antibody titres is associated with the risk of severe dengue disease, while high titres protect against clinical illness 29, 38 . As the antibody titres decay over time, there is a window of cross-protection between the DENV serotypes. A previous study found that a shorter interval between first and www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ second infections was associated with protection from clinical illness 39 . Additionally to antibodies, DENV-specific CD8 + T cells from previous exposure also seems to play a role against ZIKV. Mice primed with DENV and 30 days later challenged with ZIKV during pregnancy presented reduced burden in maternal and fetal tissues, and increased fetal viability compared to non-immune mice. DENV-immune CD8 + T cells were required for this cross-protection. However, mice challenged 80 days after DENV priming were not protected, indicating the transient nature of cross-protection again 40 .",

However, the reduction in the incidence of Zika after the last epidemic in Brazil in 2016 limits the ability to use prospective studies [43] [44] [45] . Some cohorts previously designed to study dengue and that have been adapted to also study Zika are of great value. For example, a recent study in the Pau da Lima cohort in Salvador, a large city of the NE region, Brazil, found that the titres of DENV-antibodies measured before the Zika epidemic were inversely associated with the risk of ZIKV infection 46 .

Our window of protection is wider than detected in a longitudinal analysis of human immune sera, which showed a cross-neutralizing antibody response to ZIKV on DENV-immune subjects 1-3 years after DENV infection 28 . The larger window at the ecological level is possibly an effect of herd immunity and of multiple exposures to DENV that would boost immunity.

We recognize the potential inaccuracy on the measurement of neonates' cephalic perimeter. Considering 10% fewer neonates classified as microcephalic in the NE and 10% more in other regions, the difference would be fourfold, instead of five. As for the under notification of dengue fever, we have no reason to believe there was a trend over the years that would affect our results.",
