In this current manuscript used red blood cell hitchhiking loaded/absorbed with nanocarrier for targeted delivery to the lung and the brain. I think that this paper does show a degree of novelty based on the prior concept of nanocarrier targeting with the addition of the particles to red blood cells. The authors do a good job of convincing me that this approach can be translatable, and their validation of the effect of NC uptake across multiple species provides good evidence of the efficacy of future use. The delivery of these NC particles is explored well, and the mechanism of delivery in the lungs is elucidated and well explained.

            "text": "1. The novelty of this work is the weakest point of this manuscript because of the fact that the paper lacks strong justification of the systems functioning in multiple organs outside of the lungs. This targeting of lung tissue has already been shown by this group in 2013 & 2015, and this paper reads more like a re-tune of old methods than a novel approach to target new organs. 2. Most importantly, this paper is missing a disease model where the investigators tested their cell career and demonstrated the clinical translatability of this system. For example, they show in Fig.  6 that intra-arterial delivery of RBC -hitchhiked NC resulted in higher NC uptake in the brain. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of this system they should use disease model such as orthotropic brain tumor model, try to deliver blood-brain-barrier non-permeable anti-cancer therapeutic and should demonstrate that RBC -hitchhiked system can deliver in the target organ and can achieve clinically relevant therapeutic efficacy. 3 . I would like to see more validation of no harm being done to the RBC 's that are coated with the particles. The aggregation assay shown is convincing that the NC addition itself does not cause aggregation, and arterial pressure is also measured and shown not to be increased, but is it known whether this coating affects the transfer of oxygen to or shuttling of carbon dioxide from tissues, or if the NC coating causes damage to arterial or venous walls during transit to the target organ. Experiments designed to address these questions would be critical. 4 . One thing that the authors should also consider exploring is whether or not the NC 's only pool in the organ downstream of the injection site or whether a portion of the RBC NC 's can remain in circulation and traffic to other organs. Demonstrating this does not will bolster the claim that this approach can be targeted to a specific organ. 5. Finally, while the paper demonstrates, using multiple validations, that the NC coated RBC 's deliver their targets in the lungs with a much higher ratio than the liver and spleen, and the mechanism of this delivery is explored in depth, the authors do a poor job of convincing the reader that this type of particle delivery carries much effectiveness outside of the lungs. One experiment is done to assay this delivery in the brain, and it was not completed or explained with a depth even close to the prior experiments showing efficacy in the lungs. In fact, the two major organs talked about in the intro, the heart, and brain, are scarcely even studied or referenced in the paper until the last figure, and in this figure, the data is not overall convincing that this new therapy provides a benefit over existing approaches. More validation of the delivery of the NC 's is needed in other organs before the title of this paper, as well as the claims it makes in the introduction, can be confidently stated. 6. In Fig.6 , the delivery of RBC -hitchhiked NC resulted in higher NC uptake in the brain is exciting as it is extremely difficult to cross the BBB and deliver any therapeutic to the brain. What is mechanism pretending to RBC carrier crossing the BBB without any inflammation? Authors should at least speculate in their discussion. And most importantly, what would be next step to make this career only brain or lung-specific? 7. In fig. 6 it would be nice to add another cell type as a negative control to demonstrate the career cell specificity towards these target organ. 8. In Fig 3C , what is the cause of the experimental variability between Exp#1 and Exp#2? Please Discuss. 9 . The statistical analysis is missing for Fig. 3 , 4, 5 and 6.",

However, the utility of intraarterial cannulation and administration is an (extremely) invasive technique requiring retrograde (usually) advancement of the device and subsequent therapeutic manipulation/delivery of the payload (drug, stent, etc.) These procedures are fraught with inherent risk and are undertaken in extreme circumstances as espoused by the authors (myocardial infarction, embolic cerebrovascular accident). They can and are done in less urgent/emergent situations, but it still requires a procedure, anesthesia (usually), and associated costs/risks. Again, this is not a limitation that needed to be overcome in the manuscript but it is an acknowledged limitation moving forward.

For example, did type I or type II pneumocytes take up the product? This fact is critical because most drugs/agents do not act only (or ever) on the endothelium to produce their effect(s), but actually on the parenchymal cells within the organ beyond the endothelium. Therefore, the major limitation of this paper is the lack of demonstration of parenchymal deposition/delivery to prove concept definitively and should be documented prior to publication.",

Overall the model experiments are very powerful, and the investigators have been able to demonstrate feasibility in models in mice, pigs, and in an ex-vivo human lung system. Much of the work on mechanisms of uptake and removal of the agents from the RBC s is clear, but it is curious why the role of macrophages has not been investigated. In Figure 3a -b, a stain specific for mouse macrophages should also have been used. In addition, if the mice are first treated with clodronate, to eliminate macrophages, how does this change the pattern of distribution of the injected agents? This does NOT have to be done exhaustively, but it would be important to address this question in at least one of the mouse models.",

When RH was first serendipitously discovered using bare polystyrene beads, the effect size (e.g., %ID in the lungs) was much smaller than that obtained with lung-targeting nanoparticles (NPs) that had been reported for >20 years, such as NPs coated with anti-PECAM antibodies 3, 4 . Only by screening numerous NP formulations did we find that two NPs, liposomes and nanogels, performed markedly better than all other screened NPs, and indeed better than anti-PECAM-NPs. By finding which NPs allow high-level organ delivery by RH, we dramatically changed the original RH finding from a curious but minor effect, making RH now a technique with dramatic effect sizes and capable of working with clinically-translatable NPs. \u2022 Third, this work was the first to investigate safety of RH, which turned out to give surprising results. We did not at all expect to find that the NPs used in the first report on RH, bare polystyrene, were quite deleterious to RBCs, causing severe aggregation (see Figure 4 ). By comparison, the top hits in our NP screen of RH, liposomes and nanogels, caused no such safety issues. This paper was thus pivotal in showing that RH can be safely performed, but only with select NPs, a surprising set of findings crucial for future development. \u2022 Fourth, we are the first to show the mechanism of NP transfer of RH. Previously, it was speculated without evidence that during RH, NPs transfer to the endothelium. Here we used histology to show that speculation was indeed true. Further, we made the unexpected discovery that intravascular leukocytes also participate in the transfer (Figure 3 ). \u2022 Finally, this manuscript shows that RH works not just in mice, but also rats, large animals (pigs), and even humans. Such generalizability was not easy to anticipate, since RBC properties differ greatly between species in terms of surface epitopes, stiffness, and the ratio of RBC-diameter to body size. Thus, the novel finding that RH works in many animals suggests a conserved mechanism, and perhaps one that occurs naturally. But most importantly for develop of RH as a medical technology, it works in common large animal models and even ex vivo human lungs. We wholeheartedly agree that it is of paramount importance to study the safety of RH extensively. Therefore, we have edited the manuscript to highlight our extensive studies of safety here and in another manuscript, and we additionally added new safety experiments according to the reviewers clinically astute impression of where safety issues may arise.",

To elucidate this phenomenon, we have added in Supplemental Figure 1 , which contains multi-organ biodistributions after injection at 3 different arterial sites (the right internal carotid artery, the left renal artery, and the common carotid artery). As seen in Supplemental Figure 1 , compared to free NCs, RH NCs display lower organ uptake in all off-target organs except for the lungs. The lungs have higher uptake with RH. This fits with the reviewers hypothesis that after intra-arterial injection into a target organ, some RBC-NCs pass through without transfer, and transfer to the next capillary bed, which is the lung. We have added to the Discussion section our hypothesis on the mechanism and a discussion of how this may constrain the types of cargo drugs that are optimal for brain-directed RH, as cargo drugs must not have pulmonary toxicity. Nonetheless, while lung delivery is increased after intra-arterial RH, the key finding is that we increase brain delivery by orders of magnitude.",

Finally, while the paper demonstrates, using multiple validations, that the NC coated RBC's deliver their targets in the lungs with a much higher ratio than the liver and spleen, and the mechanism of this delivery is explored in depth, the authors do a poor job of convincing the reader that this type of particle delivery carries much effectiveness outside of the lungs. One experiment is done to assay this delivery in the brain, and it was not completed or explained with a depth even close to the prior experiments showing efficacy in the lungs. In fact, the two major organs talked about in the intro, the heart, and brain, are scarcely even studied or referenced in the paper until the last figure, and in this figure, the data is not overall convincing that this new therapy provides a benefit over existing approaches. More validation of the delivery of the NC's is needed in other organs before the title of this paper, as well as the claims it makes in the introduction, can be confidently stated.",

First, we investigated whether RH NCs localize uniformly throughout the brain or display regional enrichment. We injected I-125-labeled RH NCs into the right internal carotid artery, and then sliced the mouse's brain to image it with autoradiography (Fig 6b) . As shown above, the RH NCs were strongly biased to the right side of the brain (the side injected into), though the left hemisphere receives some, likely due to the high degree of collateral flow that occurs via the Circle of Willis. Additionally, within the right hemisphere it is evident that NCs localize at higher concentrations in a few anatomically defined brain regions, such as the striatum. We next performed a similar experiment with rhodamine-labeled RH NCs (Fig 6c) , and found again the right-left assymetry, and relatively large puncta, whose size (>>200 nanometer NCs) is reminiscent of the puncta found in cells in the lungs after RH. Finally, we attempted to determine if RH caused local tissue damage in the brain, by examining H&E sections of the brain (Fig 6d) . Since RH NCs deliver much more to the targeted hemisphere (Fig 6b) , we would expect more damage to the targeted (right) side. However, we observe no right-left assymetry in tissue morphology, suggested RH NCs do not damage brain tissue. Similarly, the RH NC brains displayed no differences compared to uninjected mice. While this is only a first test of safety of RH in the brain, it is encouraging, and an initial step towards the indepth safety testing presented for the lung in Figure 4 .",

In that situation, we would want to deliver drugs to the endothelium, not to the parenchyma. The endothelium serves as the gatekeeper for the parenchyma, controlling influx of serum proteins and leukocytes, which have a major influence on ischemia-reperfusion injury 6, 7 . Therefore, many groups have used drugs that target the brain's endothelial cells in order to improve outcomes in stroke 8 . Thus, our goal with RH is to deliver drugs to or near the brain's endothelium, not cross the BBB.",

In ARDS, the endothelium is responsible for the capillary leak that causes the alveoli to fill with liquid, thus causing deoxygenation. Thus, targeting the endothelium is indeed one of the major goals for these diseases. We have added these sentiments to the Discussion.",

            "text": "The work by Brenner and colleagues provides an interesting and novel approach for the specific delivery of therapeutic agents (nanocarriers, NC) to targeted organs, based on first adsorbing the NC to erythrocytes (RBCs, red blood cell hitch-hiking, RH). Overall the model experiments are very powerful, and the investigators have been able to demonstrate feasibility in models in mice, pigs, and in an ex-vivo human lung system. Much of the work on mechanisms of uptake and removal of the agents from the RBCs is clear, but it is curious why the role of macrophages has not been investigated. In Figure  3a- This is a very good point. Since intravascular leukocytes were a surprise player in the mechanism of RH, we agree that further investigation is warranted. We therefore pursued the reviewer's suggested experiment with clodronate. To eliminate intravascular macrophages, we injected into each mouse 280 uL of 0.5mg/mL clodronate liposomes 48 hours before IV injection of RH NCs, a scheme which we have previously shown eliminates intravascular macrophages. As seen below, clodronate had no effect on the biodistribution. This suggests that macrophages may play a small role in the total lung uptake in a healthy animal. In retrospect, that may have been expected, since healthy rodents have very low numbers of pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs; 11 ), but PIMs accumulate in ARDS lungs, such as those we analyzed with histology in Figure 3 . Therefore, we attempted giving clodronate and then intratracheal LPS, but the mice all died and we ran out of time while optimizing the dosing. It seems likely that the leukocytes we stained in Figure 3 are actually \"marginated\" neutrophils, since the lungs have a very high concentration of such resident intra-vascular neutrophils both in health and disease 12 . However, given our in vitro results in Figure 3 , it is likely that any \"professional phagocyte,\" whether it's a neutrophil or macrophage, is able to pull NCs off RBCs.",

            "text": ", this paper is missing a disease model where the investigators tested their cell career and demonstrated the clinical translatability of this system. For example, they show inFig. 6that intra-arterial delivery of RBC-hitchhiked NC resulted in higher NC uptake in the brain. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of this system they should use disease model such as orthotropic brain tumor model, try to deliver bloodbrain-barrier non-permeable anti-cancer therapeutic and should demonstrate that RBChitchhiked system can deliver in the target organ and can achieve clinically relevant therapeutic efficacy.We very much agree with the reviewers that therapy is the ultimate goal of RH. Therefore, we have demonstrated that RH effectively ameliorates a major disease, pulmonary embolism (PE). PE involves clots that form in deep veins migrating into the lungs, causing shock, hypoxemia, and death. In the US alone, there are 600,000 cases of PE each year, with 60,000 deaths. Thrombolytics, such as the tPA variant reteplase, are used to dissolve the clots, but only a tiny fraction of the reteplase goes to the lungs, with the rest causing off-target bleeding, including life-threatening intracranial bleeds. To show RH may solve that problem, here we used a previously validated model of PE, in which 125 I-labeled fibrin clots are injected into the lungs, allowing PE levels to be quantified by measuring 125 I levels in the lungs. As shown inFig 6a,we first made NCs (nanogels) with reteplase conjugated onto the surface, and such reteplase-NCs displayed identical in vitro enzymatic activity as unconjugated reteplase. We then measured PE clot dissolution in vivo in mice receiving the fibrin-clot PE model, which were also injected either with saline, RH reteplase-NCs, or with free reteplase-NCs. As",

Below is a point-by-point response to the reviewers' constructive comments. Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author): This manuscript is now much-improved manuscript, and the author should be commended for their effort to address the majority of the reviewers' critics. Notably, adding a disease model pulmonary embolism now demonstrated the translational value of this approach. However, it is clear how the effectiveness of such approach was quantified in Fig.  6d . It would be nice to add a reference to their method section. Also, immunohistochemical analysis of animal lungs demonstrating the clearance of the emboli would significantly strengthen their study. Response:\u2022 We have added in references to two papers which used the exact same pulmonary embolism (PE) model we employ. Those two papers also show that the radiotracing method we used to measure PE burden correlates with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in this model. We did not add in an IHC figure because we did not have enough time to complete that experiment. Addtionally, the radiotracing is far more sensitive and quantifiable than IHC, as shown in the two papers we referenced. Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author):The investigators have produced a first-rate manuscript that is for the most part now acceptable for publication. A few issues need to be resolved. First, the response to my question concerning macrophages and clodronate is fine, but it (and the figure) MUST be included in the paper, either as a regular figure, or as a supplementary figure. Other readers will have the same question about macrophages, and the figure is needed to address these questions..",
