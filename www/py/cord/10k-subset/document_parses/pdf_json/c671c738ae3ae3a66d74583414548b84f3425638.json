Particularly, we focused on a previously unreported drug-indirubin, a compound obtained from the Indigo plant, which is now mainly used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In the current study, our results shown that indirubin could enhance the BAT activity, as evidenced by up-regulated Ucp1 expression and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function in vitro cellular model. Furthermore, indirubin treatment restrained high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain, improved glucose homeostasis and ameliorated hepatic steatosis which were associated with the increase of energy expenditure in the mice model. Moreover, we revealed that indirubin treatment increased BAT activity by promoting thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in BAT and induced browning of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (sWAT) of mice under HFD.

Two important characteristics of BAT or beige adipocytes are high mitochondrial DNA copy number and high rates of oxygen consumption. Our data showed that indirubin treatment significantly enhanced the mitochondrial OCR (Fig. 1f-e) in differentiated brown adipocytes, suggesting an elevated of the mitochondrial activities. Collected, our results suggest that indirubin can increase activity of the brown adipocytes by upregulating the BAT-enriched gene expression and by increasing mitochondrial activity. We next focused on indirubin for further in vivo research. In the present study, our results showed that indirubin treatment remarkably reduced body weight gain and adiposity and improved whole-body metabolism in HFD mice, but there was no significant difference on normal chow diet conditions (Fig. 2) . At the molecular level, we found that indirubin treatment in vivo resulted in higher UCP1expression levels (both in mRNA and protein levels) in BAT and sWAT ( Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively) , which was in accord with the in vitro screening results (Fig. 1) . Additionally, indirubin treatment also strongly upregulated the expression levels of BAT-enriched thermogenic genes involving in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as the OXPHOS proteins in BAT and sWAT ( Fig. 6 and Fig. 7) . Importantly, indirubin treatment also caused browning effect on sWAT, as reflected by the increased expression of beige specific markers (Tbx1, Cd137, and Tmem26) in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 7e) .

Besides, previous research also reveals that patients with obesity and NAFLD exhibited a reduced adiponectin transcription in adipose tissue and decreased adiponectin concentration in plasma [71] . In addition, other moleculars, such as FGF21 and BMP, have also been suggested as exercise mimetics [72] [73] [74] . Interestingly, our present findings showed that indirubin treatment did not lead to obvious alteration in the expression levels of common adipogenic maker genes (PPAR\u03b32, Ap2) in BAT and sWAT, but not adiponectin in BAT, which was increased significantly (Fig. 6d) . In consist with this, the expression level of Fgf21was also significant upregulated in differentiated brown adipocytes (Fig. 1e) and sWAT of mice under HFD after treatment with indirubin (Fig. 6d) . Moreover, in our current work, we also found that indirubin improved systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis, ameliorated hepatic steatosis and obviously decreased the expression of inflammation-related genes in liver tissues induced by HFD (Fig. 5) .

It has been proved that increased PKA activity specifically in adipose tissue could upregulate UCP1 expression and ameliorate metabolism discords. PKA activates p38 MAPK and increases the expression of UCP1, thereby promoting thermogenesis in BAT [75, 76] . Moreover, increased PKA activity has also been linked to induction of browning in sWAT [77, 78] . In adipocytes, activated PKA increases the thermogenesis-related genes such as Pgc1\u03b1 and Ucp1 expression through phosphorylating the transcription factor CREB [22, 61] . PGC1\u03b1 plays a key role in thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism. It has been reported that PGC1\u03b1 promotes the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, thereby subsequently enhancing the mitochondrial biogenesis [61, 79] . Up-regulation of PGC1\u03b1 expression in adipose tissues leads to a robust resistance to obesity and related diseases [80] . The activation of PKA triggers p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which also phosphorylates and activates of downstream effector PGC1\u03b1 [75, 81, 82] . PGC1\u03b1 then modulates the expression of UCP1, thereby promoting thermogenesis and browning in adipocytes [83] [84] [85] . Given that the PKA and p38 MAPK signaling pathway is critical for BAT activation and browning of (s) WAT, we next to evaluate whether indirubin treatment had any effect on PKA activity in adipocytes. Our study in vitro showed that indirubin significantly increased phosphorylation of PKA substrate (Fig. 8a) . In particular, the present study showed that indirubin treatment could significantly increase the abundance of active phosphorylated forms of CREB and p38 MAPK in adipocytes. We also treated adipocytes with PKA inhibitor (H89) and p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB208503), respectively. PKA inhibitor or p38 MAPK inhibitor treatment clearly blocked the level of brown fat enriched mark proteins (UCP1 and PGC1\u03b1) (Fig. 8a-b) .

Likewise, it should be considered that other closely related compounds, such as SB216763 and SB415286 (two GSK3 inhibitors), may also regulate one or both pathways controlled by indirubin in fat. Recent reports have indicated that small-molecule inhibitors of GSK3 have favorable metabolic effects in rodents, which exhibit some of the same metabolic effects as FGF21 administration, including improved glucose tolerance and prevention of diet-induced obesity [87] [88] [89] [90] . One potential mechanism by which these agents could induce thermogenenic activation is by inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 in a PKA-dependent manner, which in turn result in enhanced activity of p38 MAPK signaling module [91] . In our study, we found treatment of differentiated brown adipocytes with indirubin (10 \u03bcM) indeed showed a modest inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 by enhanced the phosphorylation of Ser-9 (p-GSK3\u03b2) (Ser9) in vitro (Supplymentary Figure 3) . However, from our results, we are unable to conclude on the relative contribution of GSK3\u03b2 or its paralogs to BAT activation. A precise mechanism by which indirubin treatment in adipocytes lead to increased thermogenesis remains to be further determined, but it is clear that PKA and p38 MAPK activation is very important for the effects.
