Six health zones, including Beni, Butembo, Oicha, Mabalako, and Musienene in North-Kivu province, and Mandima in Ituri province have since reported confirmed and probable EVD cases. Within a month, 122 EVD cases (91 confirmed, 31 probable), including 82 deaths (67% case-fatality rate) had been reported with an additional nine suspected cases pending laboratory testing for EVD [2] . North Kivu province shares borders with Uganda in the east, and there is frequent cross-border movement due to trade, farming, healthcare, and social activities. In addition, North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been the centre of interethnic clashes for some time now, and harbor over a million displaced persons, with active rebel activities causing prolonged insecurity. Since December 2018, there has been a continuous influx of refugees into Uganda, resulting in a high risk of EVD introduction into the country.",

Guinea was the epicenter and the initial site of the largest-ever EVD outbreak, leading to intense transmission in Guinea as well as the neighbouring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone. Transmission to neighbouring countries was associated with illprepared health systems and poor inter-governmental coordination, factors that led to poor disease surveillance, insufficient infection prevention and control and clinical care. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone had a long history of socio-economic underdevelopment due to civil conflict leading to very weak and severely underresourced health systems. The outbreak was further exacerbated by infected persons crossing the highly porous borders of the countries involved [5, 6] . As a result, this outbreak caused significant mortality, with reported case-fatality rates of up to 70%.",

The NTF developed a multi-agency Incident Management System (IMS) to coordinate preparedness efforts and guide central and field EVD activities. The major IMS components are command and management of preparedness activities, resource management, communication, and information management. The NTF assigned an Incident Management Commander (IMC) and team, made of 6 technical subcommittee team leads encompassing the eleven key WHO EVD preparedness components, including: 1) epidemiological surveillance (contact tracing, capacities at PoEs, and laboratory incorporated); 2) case management and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) including psycho-social support, waste management and safe and dignified burials; 3) risk communication and community engagement; 4) vaccination, therapeutics, and research; 5) emergency coordination including budgeting and resource mobilisation; and 6) logistics [10]. The IMT was responsible for planning and managing preparedness resources and activities, guiding activity implementation through the DTFs, and reporting back progress from each district to the NTF. After the initial risk assessment, 20 districts bordering North Kivu and Ituri provinces were categorized as high-risk for EVD importation, 10 as moderate-risk, and the remaining districts as low-risk. Through the IMS, all 20 high-risk and 10 moderate-risk districts were supported to formulate and/or reactivate their DTFs to constitute sub-committees for the 6 core preparedness and coordinate interventions at district level. The DTFs comprised the district political, civic, security, and health leadership as well as technical advisors from different partners working in the districts.",

Through face-to-face interviews with key informants and discussions with the DRRT, the NRRT scored activities under each core capacity of preparedness. The assessment team verified responses by looking at documented evidence and implementation of the recommended core capacities at the district and health facility level. The NRRT held group discussions with health facility teams on epidemiological surveillance, case management, IPC, laboratory and contact tracing. Scores were assigned to each of the core capacity components (green for complete/in place and red for incomplete/not yet in place) and then percentages of the total tasks that were completed for each core capacity were computed for Fig. 2 National Budget and Financial Contribution to EVD preparedness by Implementing Partner each district. Any district with a level of preparedness component at \u226450% was considered unprepared (red), between 50 and 75% was considered as fairly ready (yellow), and those above 75% were considered prepared for that component.

The NRRT held key informant interviews with the District Health Team (DHT), which included the District Health Officers, Surveillance Focal Persons, Health Inspectors and Health Educators, and local leaders at known border PoEs and along priority porous borders. Several official and non-official high-risk crossing points for population movement from DRC across border districts were identified. Trained facilitators also interviewed Township Chairpersons, Town Clerks, Subcounty Chiefs, Mayors, and transport operatives in the high-risk locations. In addition, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with village leaders, community health workers in the cited high-risk locations for DRC population were held. The FGDs were guided by an adapted PopCAB FGD guide to gather information about the type of people crossing the border, their points of origin, congregation points, reasons for entering Uganda, duration of their stay and destinations. GPS coordinates for each of the locations were recorded. We developed summaries from key informant interviews and focus group discussions aided with sketch maps to track crossborder movements and indicate key locations for the DRC population. The facilitators integrated participatory mapping with spatially-accurate, printed maps in the key informant interviews and focus group discussions to identify location information for priority points of interest and travel routes. Respondents described population movement patterns associated with refugees who leave the Uganda settlements to visit their relatives in DRC and return back to Uganda. In addition, they described the patterns of persons newly-arriving from the DRC to established refugee reception centers and resettlements areas in Uganda such as Kyangwali in Hoima District or Kyaka II in Kyegegwa District, as well as DRC traders traveling across Lakes Albert and George to major markets in towns in the Ugandan border and non-border districts for business, and others who fly directly to Entebbe International Airport from Goma, Eastern DRC. The DRRT used the results to identify several official and non-official high-risk border locations with population movement from DRC into border districts.

The aim of the initial Ebola vaccination campaign was to protect frontline health and non-health workers in Uganda under a compassionate-use strategy to protect persons at potential risk for EVD in advance of an outbreak. Once approval was granted, the MoH, with support from the WHO, secured 3000 vaccine doses, established and trained national vaccination teams, organized cold chain logistics, selected districts and mostat-risk workers in health care facilities, PoEs and other locations (laboratories, airport, etc.), and commenced voluntary vaccination. Vaccination proceeded according to a site-by-site plan ranking highest-to lowest-risk sites for EVD case introduction from the DRC. The vaccination campaign planning committee used PopCAB results from identified districts to inform their decisions about which heath care facilities and Poe to target during the initial vaccination campaign. An additional 3000 doses of vaccines were later secured to scale up the vaccination exercise. By the end of April 2019, Uganda had vaccinated 4419 health workers in 13 high-risk districts (Fig. 6 .",

With support from several partner organizations, Uganda was able to activate the NTF and create an active IMS and a partner coordination matrix, mobilize resources and carry out preparedness activities in 30 designated high-and moderate-risk districts on its western border with DRC as well as on adjacent borders with Rwanda and South Sudan and the central urban hubs of Kampala and Entebbe, linked to population movements from and to the DRC's outbreak hotspots. In addition, Uganda has established multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary national and district task forces, and technical subcommittees for each preparedness pillar that advise the NTF and act as liaisons between the NTF and the high-and moderate-risk districts. These quick actions were most influenced by Uganda's experiences with four previous EVD outbreaks [16] . With this experience and support from partners, activation was quick and was established with relative ease. The lasting impact of these efforts is a high likelihood that it could generate momentum towards national and partners' commitments to support long-term emergency preparedness for future outbreaks.",
