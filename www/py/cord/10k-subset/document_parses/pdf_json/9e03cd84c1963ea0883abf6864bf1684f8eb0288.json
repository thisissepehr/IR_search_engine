This mechanism would entail lower rates of 1918-1919 pandemic-associated morbidity and mortality among older adults, relative to their experience with pre-1918 influenza viruses. Although detailed morbidity rates by single year of age and season are lacking, Kentucky mortality data are consistent with prior immunity to the 1918-1919 pandemic virus in age cohorts born before 1892-1894. The global pandemic virus of the 1830s, the possibly related transregional virus of 1847, and their descendants may have conferred protection against the 1918 pandemic virus [8] . Accordingly, prior influenza exposure in the mid-to-late 19th century may have protected older Kentucky adults against severe 1918-1919 pandemic-associated mortality. In contrast, individuals living in more remote areas in the 19th century may have escaped these pandemic strains and, consequently, may have experienced high excess mortality rates during the 1918 pandemic [10, 11, 25] . Thus, geographical differences in adult mortality rates linked to historical influenza virus circulation patterns tend to favor the antigenic recycling hypothesis. Further rationale for this hypothesis comes from a related mortality-sparing phenomenon that was observed in the 1957, 1968, and 2009 pandemics and associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies in older individuals [32] [33] [34] [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 140, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 255, "end": 258, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 259, "end": 262, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 827, "end": 830, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1210, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1214, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1218, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1614, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1619, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1620, "end": 1624, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1629, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Although the antigenic recycling hypothesis is an attractive explanation of the low 1918-1919 pandemic excess mortality rates among older adults, it is a less parsimonious explanation for younger individuals.

Accordingly, our sensitivity analysis excluding military deaths among non-Kentucky residents points to a lower death rate among young adult males and a peak risk later in life, compared with the main analysis. However, we believe that this analysis underestimates the death rates among males because it does not include deaths occurring among Kentucky residents who were training out of state or were involved in combat. Consistent with other military settings, the population of Camp Taylor had a much higher death rate than the rest of Kentucky, at approximately 1.8%-1.9% (Supplementary Materials).

Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis with a traditional seasonal Serfling approach yielded very similar excess mortality estimates. Additionally, our excess mortality estimates for Kentucky are highly consistent with those reported for other locations [2, 4, 9, 10, 23] .
