This phase can be wholly environmental, where for example infected humans excrete parasite eggs in feces and others are exposed via contaminated food or, as in the case of hookworm, where contact with contaminated soil can result in penetration of the parasite through the intact skin. Alternatively, the environmental phase may consist of time spent in an intermediate host, such as a snail or fish, itself subject to heterogeneous environments.

Asexual reproduction in the snail produces cercariae, another free-swimming aquatic stage with a lifespan on the order of a day, which penetrate the intact skin of a definitive host and mature into adult worms. The worms sexually pair and the female lays copious numbers of eggs that are the source of pathogenic response in the host. Some of these eggs find their way into the feces or urine, are excreted and the cycle begins again. The intermediate host, a freshwater snail and the two free-living aquatic stages are known to be subject to environmental stresses such as temperature 1 and shear forces present in the water column. 2 For S. japonicum, the species that causes schistosomiasis in east and southeast Asia, transmission is further complicated by the fact that a variety of mammals can serve as the definitive host, 3 including rodents, dogs, cats, pigs and water buffalo, the latter of which is particularly important to sustaining transmission in the lower Yangtze environment. 4 In China, considerable progress has been made since the 1950s controlling transmission of S. japonicum in humans and domestic animals. From a total of 433 endemic counties in 1959, the disease has been eliminated from 260 counties leaving approximately 800,000 infected people and another 60 million at risk. 5, 6 However, these represent only a small fraction of the worldwide total of schistosomiasis cases that the World Health Organization estimates at 200 million, 85% of which are in Africa. 7 Most of these infections are suffered by poor people, particularly children and most are preventable and treatable, although effective vaccines remain a hope for the future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 738, "end": 739, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 786, "end": 787, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 982, "end": 983, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1147, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1459, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1461, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1647, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Where schistosomiasis transmission has been eliminated, targeted environmental modifications have often played an important role. 8 Conversely, major environmental changes such as water development projects have often led to a sustained elevating effect on schistosomiasis prevalence. 9 The underlying mechanisms shaping this relationship are poorly understood. An expansion in the preferred habitat of intermediate host snails is often implicated in these prevalence increases, yet few data exist to fortify this claim. 10 In China, recent evidence points to the influence of changing water levels on intermediate host populations. 11 Yet a clear mechanistic understanding of the processes that lead to increased disease is lacking and therefore opportunities to mitigate the disease impact of water projects using engineering or design principles is limited. 12 Schistosomes are not alone among disease systems where mechanisms bridging environmental factors and epidemiological parameters have been poorly characterized. For example, although it has been well established that meningococcal meningitis in western Africa exhibits seasonal patterns, the particular causes remain uncertain and could range from low humidity to wind speed. 13 Similarly, multiple drivers have been proposed for the seasonal nature of cholera, including rainfall, temperature and planktonic blooms. Yet the specific roles of these drivers have not been resolved and well-established dynamic features, such as the second cholera peak experienced in endemic regions in south Asia, have gone largely unexplained. 14 Given the limited mechanistic understanding of environment-disease interactions, mathematical models that describe them have seldom included the effects of time-varying environmental processes on transmission dynamics. Where they have been included, seasonality is commonly incorporated phenomenologically, using mathematical functions that are periodic in time and therefore describe in a generic way the seasonal variation in a parameter-a simple sinusoidal function is a common example. Few examples exist where seasonal forcing functions describe the actual processes underlying the environmental drivers of disease dynamics. 15 Because models that incorporate seasonality are sensitive to which parameters are externally forced as well as the shape of their forcing, there is a pressing need to identify the actual mechanisms at play.

For the case of West Nile virus, for example, simulation studies have suggested that concentrating pesticide spraying efforts during the spring, when most transmission occurs among birds, could be more effective than the current practice of spraying in response to human cases in the late summer and early fall when mosquito numbers are already in decline. 16 Ultimately, models and management practices that incorporate the timing of key events such as intermediate host reproduction and parasite development are essential to developing more successful control strategies. Understanding these mechanisms is also vital for estimating the long-term impact of impending climate change at global and regional scales on environmentally mediated diseases, whereas current projections are, to a large extent, empirically-based. Indeed, it has been argued in the case of malaria, for example, that models which are mechanistic, based on plausible underlying drivers of the system and basic biology, rather than empirical relationships, are more useful for predicting and responding to, the influence of climate change. 17 Table 1 summarizes the evolution from simple deterministic models, to complex spatially-explicit, individually-based models appropriate for studying re-emergent scenarios in the Sichuan environment, where connectivity and environmental heterogeneity structure the dynamics of transmission.

Juveniles are submerged during early stages of development, while adults are often found above the water line on vegetation and on shaded moist soil.

With respect to the S. japonicum parasite, I term these flows parasite diffusion, using the phrase to encompass all diffusive pathways along which parasites are transported into new and existing locales. The presence of suitable pathways can affect the probability of emergence of transmission, the level of worm burden within a community once transmission is established and how transmission spreads to neighboring areas.

The indirect transmission of schistosomiasis differs from recent epidemiological modelling of social connectivity and contact networks for communicable disease spread. [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] Within the context of the endemic transmission situation, small-scale human mobility can spread parasites from village to village. This effect may be small though in comparison to other social behaviors, such as the renting or selling of water buffalo which, if infected, can potentially release much larger numbers of eggs into the environment. While these factors might be modeled much like hydrological connectivity over the small scale via inter-village flows, they differ from the hydrological situation in that these processes can occur over much larger spatial scales and much less predictably.

The simplest form would be a stochastic compartmental model, where the risk group structure would be maintained with each compartment being comprised of a number of identical individuals. However, the static representation of the aggregation of parasites in humans in the deterministic model, even within our risk groups, does not translate easily to the re-emergent situation where, initially, the population is parasite-free. Hence, an individually-based model is preferred. 31 Individual-based micro-simulation models have been utilized in studying schistosomiasis transmission in endemic settings, but without our emphasis on environmental factors. 85 In ecology there has also been considerable interest in individually-based models. 86 There, the analog to our discrete population of humans is a population of animals in a heterogeneous, but continuous environment. There are particularly interesting approaches being explored which might allow us to naturally utilize our GIS data base and GPS-based maps in an individually-based model. 87 Figure 8 . A diagrammatic conceptualization of the re-emergence model. The frame of reference of the flowchart is the interaction of one individual with the ditch environment. Stochastic introduction processes include host migration and import of cercariae and miracidiae, while cercarial exposure, egg distribution and hydrologic transport processes are implemented on a spatially-explicit, segmented mapping of the ditch environment. Figure 8 schematically represents the elements of a new model in which the stochastic introduction of parasites is implemented by means of migration of infected hosts and advective parasite transport. Heterogeneous ditch environments, then, serve as platforms wherein eggs are released from infected individuals who, along with uninfected individuals, traverse the waterway environments and are potentially infected by contact with cercarial contaminated water. Stochastic implementations of the egg release and cercarial exposure processes are particularly suitable for a system where transmission is strongly conditioned by both environmental and behavioral factors that defy deterministic formulation. Moreover the stochastic model proposed here provides the structure to capture the potentially large influence of chance events that have been recognized to govern early epidemic dynamics, even in relatively large populations.
