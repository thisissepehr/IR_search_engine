We examine fundamental mechanisms involved in the vesiculation processes induced by a cluster of envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of the dengue virus (DENV) using molecular dynamics simulations and a coarsegrained model. We show that an arrangement of three E-M heterotetramers (EM 3 ) works as a bending unit and an ordered cluster of five such units generates a closed vesicle, reminiscent of the virus budding process. In silico mutagenesis of two charged residues of the anchor helices of the envelope proteins of DENV shows that Arg-471 and Arg-60 are fundamental to produce bending stress on the membrane. The fine-tuning between the size of the EM 3 unit and its specific bending action suggests this protein unit is an important factor in determining the viral particle size.",

Biological membranes consist of phospholipid bilayers with embedded integral and peripheral proteins that can rotate and translate laterally. Membranes may attain curvature as a consequence of asymmetry imposed by its own constituents, such as cholesterol, or by the presence of external molecules, such as proteins that can insert hydrophobic domains into one side of the bilayer with membrane-piercing \u03b1-helices [7] . This type of helix can hook the opposite side of the membrane and produce a local constriction on membrane thickness or they may act as scaffolds for membrane curvature [1, 8, 9] . Moreover, domains of different lipids or clusters of proteins, as well as the boundaries of an open membrane, may produce lines of tension that introduce extra forces on the membrane [10, 11] .",

These include local membrane bending [1] followed by virus budding and final membrane scission, in which the virion is detached from the cellular membrane [12] . Specifically, the dengue virus (DENV) [13, 14] is coated by replicas of two proteins, namely envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins, forming 90 E-M heterotetramers (2 E + 2 M) that cover a spherical phospholipid membrane. The E protein presents a soluble ectodomain (sE) and a transmembrane domain (TMD) that acts as an anchor. The M protein resides under the E protein shell, practically immersed in the virus membrane (figures 1(A) and (B)). The transmembrane domain of the E-M heterotetramer is subdivided into stem and anchor helices (figure 1(A)); the stem helices have a polar/nonpolar surface pattern and are all accommodated at one side of the bilayer surface, while the anchors, mostly hydrophobic, present polar residues only at their distal loops [14] [15] [16] . Theses loops connect two helices of the E protein (ET1; ET2) and two helices of the M protein (MT1; MT2).",

Essentially, this work concerns the description and analysis of the membrane bending and vesiculation mechanisms induced by the envelope proteins of the DENV. The EM 15 system emulates a fragment of the DENV envelope: it is composed of an open membrane patch of 59 \u00d7 59 nm 2 encrusted by 1/6 of the outer structural proteins of DENV immersed in solvent particles, amounting to the equivalent of three million atoms.",

We present in silico mutagenesis experiments that corroborate the notion that the membrane-bending forces are a consequence of the phospholipid rearrangement triggered by the relatively short length of the TMD of the E-M proteins. As more E-M heterotetramers are assembled in a symmetric setup, the resulting curvature in the planar phospholipid bilayer leads to a self-assembled vesicle, impelled by the accumulated mechanical stress imposed by the proteins and also by a line of tension along the membrane boundary.",

Hence CG can not be used to generate simulation trajectories, the resulting ensemble is not a Boltzmann ensemble and the concept of time is ill-defined.

In the case of DENV, the anchor helices ET1 and ET2 are 16 and 17 residues long, respectively, whereas they are only 12 and 14 residues long for MT1 and MT2, respectively. Initially, the TMD of the E-M proteins was aligned closely to the upper layer of a continuous membrane (figure 2(A); see also the Methods section); this configuration is thermodynamically unfavorable because the anchor helices, which are relatively short, have their polar loops in a hydrophobic environ ment (the middle portion of the membrane). Therefore, a prompt rearrangement of the lipids molecules and cholesterol molecules takes place, producing a local constriction on the membrane: the bottom layer is attracted by the polar tip of the anchor helices, pulling down the whole TMD, which gets embedded deeper into the membrane, pressuring the upper monolayer. Promptly, the E-M heterotetramer becomes attached to the membrane through the amphipathic EH1, EH2, and MH helices. Concomitantly, the lipid rearrangement leads to a number of polar phosphate groups from the bottom layer to move toward the polar helices' loops. After about 50 ns, the system is stabilized in a conformation that shows an upper planar layer and a bottom layer containing an indentation right below the TMD ( figure 2(B) ), which leads to a locally reduced thickness of the bilayer. This is in good agreement to the experimental observation made using cryo-electron microscopy that the membrane thickness is reduced by the transmembrane helices of E and M [14] .",

In turn, along the x-direction, the overall curvature is practically zero ( figure 3(B) ). The local radius of curvature R C observed along the y-axis, just at the middle of the protein cluster, converges asymptotically to the actual radius of the mature DENV particle [14] R virus \u2248 25 nm (figure 3(C), full symbols). R C corresponds to the average between the internal and external bilayer radii of curvatures. This result suggests that, by imposing a defined curvature upon the membrane, the transmembrane helices of the EM 3 cluster may be a key factor in determining the virus size as well as the number of its envelope components.",

Tension is also accumulated along the membrane rounded edge, which forces to reduce its perimeter; see Movie-1 and 2, in supplementary material (stacks.iop.org/ JPhysCM/29/504002/mmedia).

The overall impact of such migration is a decrease of 16% in the total area occupied by all lipids and, as one would expect, a corresponding increase in 19% in lipid density in the whole vesicle. This behavior is, however, asymmetric between the layers: while the inner layer area decreases 36% and its densitydefined as the number of lipid head groups per unit area of the membrane-increases 28%, the outer layer shows a different behavior due to the large number of lipids that it accepted during vesiculation; its area expanded by 10% and its lipid density also increased by 12% ( figure 6 ).

(A) Structures of the EM heterotetramer (two E and two M) of DENV: domain I (DI, red), domain II (DII, yellow), and domain III (DIII, blue) are the three domains collectively called ectodomain of E. The TMD is composed of (i) stem: six helices (two sets each of EH1, EH2, and MH) partially embedded into the bilayer, and (ii) anchor: eight membrane-piercing helices (two sets each of ET1, ET2, MT1, and MT2). (B) Structural surface of DENV as crystallographically determined; note the fivefold axis at the center of the figure (blue circle-like spot). White lines highlight the three systems considered here, composed of one (EM 1 ), three (EM 3 ), and fifteen (EM 15 ) EM heterotetramers. (C) EM 1 system: one EM heterotetramer anchored in a flat continuous membrane connected with its images through the periodic boundary conditions. (D) The EM 3 system corresponds to three EM 1 shaped as an irregular rhombus also planted parallel into the flat 'continuous' membrane. (E) In turn, the EM 15 system (shown in smaller scale here) consists of five groups of EM 3 , facing each other in a rotationally symmetric fashion, embedded into a flat open membrane patch of size 59 \u00d7 59 nm 2 . It reproduces a planar version of the cluster of fifteen EM heterotetramers around the fivefold axis of the icosahedral symmetry of the DENV.",

The number of lipids molecules and cholesterol molecules in the upper layer was about 22% less than in the lower layer, due to the surface area S p occupied by the protein cluster. Five EM 3 structures constituted the building blocks of the EM 15 system, forming a cluster of 15 E-M heterotetramers. Note that six such raft-like domains are needed to cover the entire DENV (figures 1(B) and (E)). The lines coming out from the DENV five fold symmetry axis and passing through domain II of the ectodomain of protein E of each EM 3 (figures 1(B) and (E), colored yellow), define the five arms of the EM 15 system. Each EM 3 block bends the membrane along each arm of the EM 15 cluster.",
