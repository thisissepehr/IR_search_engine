Therefore, viral infection is defined as a presence of an identifiable viral organism with inflammatory symptoms.

Mortality among immunocompetent patients with lower UTI is extremely low; however, viral UTI with high viral load can be associated with high mortality in immunocompromised patients because of associated viremia and multiorgan viral infections and failure. Antivirals themselves have significant side effects, and their use may induce organ rejection [4] .

Recently, hemorrhagic cystitis was considered a complication of chemotherapy, especially with alkylating drugs such as busulfan. However, with improved methods of viral detections, it was found that viral infections are a common cause of hemorrhagic cystitis. In a prospective study of more than 100 children who underwent bone marrow transplantation, hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in 25.5%, and viral cause was identified in more than 95% of children with hemorrhagic cystitis. Polyoma BKV was detected in the urine of 21 patients (80.8%), adenovirus (AdV) was detected in four ( Viral hemorrhagic cystitis can also occur after renal transplantation, but its prevalence is lower than in bone marrow transplantation recipients, which may be attributed to lower risk of BKV reactivation rate after renal transplantation. This is thought to be secondary to less pronounced suppression of cellular immune response, which is needed to prevent rejection in solid organ transplantation [6] . BKV and AdV are the most common viral pathogens isolated in hemorrhagic cystitis after renal transplantation. BKV can cause interstitial nephritis, ureteral stenosis, and hemorrhagic cystitis and is almost always treated with antivirals [7] . Adenoviral hemorrhagic cystitis is usually self-limiting, and treatment depends on clinical picture. Detection of AdV in urine in patients with hemorrhagic cystitis is pathognomic of adenoviral cystitis [5\u2022\u2022, 8, 9] .",

The darker the color in the well, the more antigens (viral particles) present in the specimen.

ELISA is a relatively simple and fast technique that is often used in automatic assays; however, small changes in volumes of sandwich antibodies or developer will affect the results (pipetting error). In automatic instrumentation, the chemicals are dispensed from prefilled containers, and \"carry-over\" contamination between different runs of assay can easily occur.

Because developments of antibodies against a virus take time and use of immunosuppressants may modulate immune response, lack or presence of antibodies may not exclude or confirm current infection. This is especially true in viruses, such as HSV, CMV, and BKV, with a high prevalence (17%, > 60%, and > 90%, respectively) among an immunocompetent population in the United States [15, 16] . HSV and BKV are especially important in urology. To find out if a patient was ever exposed to HSV, one can measure immunoglobulin G against HSV levels, which should be elevated. During acute or recent infection, the immunoglobulin M titer allows for differentiation of new viral infection versus history of exposure in the past. Immunoglobulin M increases within 2 weeks of exposure. The results for antibodies are reported as titers, and increasing titers makes it more likely that the patient has current infection. Because of some nonspecific binding of a patient's antibodies to the antigen, good quality laboratories stratify their titers into negative, undetermined, and positive. Undetermined titers can be a result of nonspecific binding or of current infection when the host has not yet produced enough antibodies to be detected. If levels of antibodies are within an undetermined level, the assay should be repeated in 2 to 4 weeks, or direct method of detection should be used.",

Even a single change in the nucleotide sequence can affect the binding of primers, and if the annealing temperature is high, the presence of a virus may not be detected (false-negative result). The viruses also occur in multiple genotypes (example HPV or AdV) thus, often one assay is not able to detect all genotypes.

BKV has a significant homology to a neurotropic virus, causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or JCV. BKV was first identified in the urine of a renal transplantation recipient with the initials B.K. (by Dr. Sylvia D. Gardner in 1971). The BKV virus has a urotheliotropic nature and can be identified in the collecting system epithelium and transitional epithelium. The typical cytopathologic changes of BKV are often found in a healthy person, and it is believed to represent transient shedding of virions in urine, most likely secondary to stress or decreased immune response. The patient's cytopathologic changes resolve within 3 months, and there seems to be no clinically significant sequelae of BKV-positive cytology in immunocompetent people [20] . High-grade transitional cell carcinoma can be difficult to distinguish from BKV on cytology, and follow-up cytology may be considered in patients with risk factors for transitional cell carcinoma [21] . Up to 0.3% of the healthy population and 3% of pregnant women will have BKV-positive urine cytology [22] . The interest in BKV paralleled development in potent immunosuppressants and the discovery of an association between reactivation of BKV in patients with renal transplantation and progressive nephropathy and allograft loss-polyomavirus-induced nephropathy [23] . The BKV is commonly found in the urine of patients with hemorrhagic cystitis and ureteral strictures, especially after bone marrow and solid organ transplantations ",

Most BKV infections occur within 1 to 6 months after transplantation (Table 4 ). The clinical diagnosis needs to be confirmed by detecting the virus in the urine or blood. Recipients of renal transplantation may also have associated graft dysfunction, and renal biopsy may show typical interstitial nephritis with characteristic changes in tubules. The presence of BKV in renal parenchyma may be detected by commercially available antibodies. Because of the high prevalence of positive antibodies in the serum and lack of a reliable viral cell culture, the diagnosis of BKV lower UTIs requires molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time PCR, which allows for the detection of BKV and an estimation of the number of viral copies per mL of urine or blood [25] . BKV DNA is rarely detected in the urine of a healthy individual. Urine cytology can be indicative of BKV infection by identifying so-called \"decoy\" cells; however, sensitivity of decoy cells in diagnosis of BKV infection in hemorrhagic cystitis is low [26] . Real-time PCR tests and quantification of viral copies seem to have prognostic value and can be used to monitor response to therapy. BKV is detected in 87% of patients with hemorrhagic cystitis after bone marrow transplantation, and the prevalence of BKV is statistically higher than in patients without hemorrhagic cystitis [3\u2022\u2022]. BKV is more prevalent than AdV in patients with hemorrhagic cystitis [5\u2022\u2022,27]. Urine should be sent for BKV and AdV detection by PCR for every patient with hemorrhagic cystitis who is immunocompromised.",

Cidofovir can also be given IV at a similar dose; however, bladder instillation may avoid nephrotoxic complications of the drug. Cidofovir is active against the CMV and AdV, though it is less active against BKV, and by itself, it can cause nephropathy. Thus, intravesical instillation may be a better option for hemorrhagic cystitis, especially because the AdV plays a role in some of the patients with hemorrhagic cystitis, and cidofovir may be active against both organisms [1\u2022\u2022,32,33\u2022\u2022,34]. The response to treatment is measured by quantitative real-time PCR and resolution of hematuria. Although BKV is (without a question) the dominant viral cause of cystitis, only 50% of patients with BKV viruria will develop hemorrhagic cystitis, and prophylactic treatment with cidofovir may not be necessary. However, preemptive management-starting therapy as soon as the patient develops cystitis-may be beneficial, taking into account the high morbidity associated with hemorrhagic cystitis after bone marrow transplantation. One study showed that ciprofloxacin prophylaxis decreased the viral load of BKV as compared with cephalosporin. The mechanism of this finding is unclear [35] .",

The diagnosis using molecular techniques is faster because the culture can take up to 21 days. Adenoviral disease refers to presence of virus and symptoms of invasive disease.

Cidofovir is becoming an optional treatment of adenoviral infections and should be considered a first-choice antiviral to treat AdV cystitis. Lower dose (1 mg/kg three times per week for 3 weeks) is used in renal transplantation patients because of concern of nephrotoxicity of cidofovir, but this regiment fails to prevent HSV or CMV infections, and a higher dose (5 mg/kg once a week, IV or intravesical) may be a better choice [42, 33, 43] . It is possible that the nephrotoxicity of cidofovir is a result of often reduced immunosuppression and rejection and not the result of cidofovir itself, and a higher dose with continued immunosuppression may result in less long-term complications. Ribavirin, which has relatively poor activity against AdV, has been more successful in treating human leukocyte antigen-matched bone marrow recipients. Ribavirin is less successful in decreasing mortality in children [44] [45] [46] . Ganciclovir is mostly used for prevention of CMV infection; however, it has been used in the treatment of hemorrhagic cystitis in transplantation patients [47] . Vidarabine (10 mg/kg/day for 5 days) has been successfully used in the treatment of hemorrhagic cystitis and may be a viable alternative to cidofovir, but it is less active in generalized AdV infections [45, [48] [49] [50] .

CMV reactivation or new infection are common in transplantation patients, and they can cause significant mortality and morbidity, hence CMV prophylaxis is commonly employed in patients after transplantation. CMV is a relatively rare cause of lower UTIs; however, circumferential evidence supports the association between CMV and hemorrhagic cystitis [51] . Reports of resolution of hematuria after treatment with IV ganciclovir have added further evidence linking CMV and hemorrhagic cystitis [51] . Although rare, CMV cystitis can also occur in immunocompetent patients [52] . Hemorrhagic cystitis has been clearly associated with reactivation of CMV [53, 54] .
