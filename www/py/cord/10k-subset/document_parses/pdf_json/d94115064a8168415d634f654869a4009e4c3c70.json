Overall, adherence to the hand hygiene intervention in terms of soap and alcohol use appeared low when benchmarked against rates recommended in health care settings. However we note that a previous randomized community study found that 38% of households used more than 57 g of alcohol hand sanitizer during a 2-week period [30] , whereas more than 50% of the households in our study used more than 56 g in 10 days.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 659, "end": 663, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Overall, the SAR was lower than we had expected. Only 6% of household contacts developed laboratory-confirmed influenza, whereas 5%-18% of contacts developed clinical influenza, depending on case definitions. This is in contrast to previous studies in France [21] , Seattle [31] and other places [19] , where SARs were approximately 25% (laboratory-confirmed influenza in the latter two studies). There could be a number of reasons for this. First, there has not been significant antigenic drift in the predominant circulating strains of influenza viruses in recent years, potentially resulting in higher levels of pre-existing immunity among our study population. Secondly, our inclusion criteria specified that an index subject should be the only member of their household to be suffering from ILI, and no other household contacts should have experienced ILI in the past 14 days, to ensure that the index is a true index within the household. However, the latter condition may have biased our recruitment towards households where some members were already immune from infection, since among households where all contacts were susceptible there might be a greater possibility of secondary cases being observed prior to the index case presenting to their primary care provider 1-2 days after symptom onset (Figure 2a ). However the French study used similar inclusion criteria and found a much higher SAR [21] . Antiviral prescriptions for index subjects followed with home visits appears to affect transmission as would be expected [19] , where there was a relative reduction in the SAR of approximately 30% albeit based on a limited sample size. Vaccination of household contacts might also have reduced the risk of secondary infection (Table 3 ). Finally, environmental or behavioral differences could lead to differing secondary transmission rates in our study, for example differences in use of air conditioning, high background use of face masks, or differences in the amount of time spent with family members at home. We did not collect the relevant data in the present study however; future studies should consider these externalities. Results from other settings with a similar design would be helpful in assessing, at least qualitatively, these respective effects.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 259, "end": 263, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 274, "end": 278, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 296, "end": 300, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1409, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1533, "end": 1537, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1306, "end": 1316, "text": "(Figure 2a", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1746, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The variability in clinical SARs depending on the choice of case definition has been noted in previous studies [21, 32, 33] . Influenza infection is associated with a wide spectrum of symptoms and severities, and in our study 4 (19%) of the 21 laboratory-confirmed secondary cases were asymptomatic. On the other hand, only 10 (48%) of laboratory-confirmed secondary cases reported fever $38uC. With such a range of symptoms caused by influenza, and when infections with other circulating upper respiratory viruses cause similar symptoms, collectively referred to as influenza-like-illnesses, it is difficult to find a single case definition which is highly sensitive and also highly specific for influenza virus. With a small sample size it is not possible here to derive clinical prediction rules [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] , however we compared three alternative case definitions and found that the most predictive (with highest area under the ROC curve) was at least two of the following signs and symptoms: fever $37.8uC, cough, headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints (Appendix Table S1 ). While the clinical SARs rely on self-reported symptoms, the diaries were checked for completeness and accuracy by trained nurses during home visits every 3 days. The proportion of asymptomatic infection in our study was lower than might have been expected (i.e. closer to 50%) based on earlier studies with paired serology [31] , perhaps suggesting that we might have missed some infections when assessing the secondary outcomes of clinical influenza. The corollary is that the true secondary infection rate might well have been higher than estimated (and estimable) by our SARs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 115, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 116, "end": 119, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 120, "end": 123, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 804, "end": 808, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 809, "end": 813, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 814, "end": 818, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 819, "end": 823, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 824, "end": 828, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1445, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1106, "end": 1114, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The dropout was higher than anticipated; all subjects were advised of the study requirements and gave informed consent before being recruited into the study (and tested by rapid influenza test without charge), but 35% of randomized subjects/ households refused to allow any home visits. These decisions were independent of the allocated intervention, since the interventions were only revealed during the first home visit. Dropout was higher among the group randomized with a negative result on the rapid diagnostic test (after June 1, 2008), perhaps because subjects interpreted their negative result as indicating they did not have influenza thus did not require follow-up. A negative rapid test result does not rule out influenza virus infection [39] , and we chose to randomize such subjects to allow wider generalizability in terms of including index subjects with a likely greater range of influenza viral shedding profiles albeit with the limitation that some index subjects might have been infected with a different pathogen; in the latter case those households would be unnecessarily followed up since only households with index subjects with confirmed influenza (by viral culture or RT-PCR) were included in the final analyses.

First, the use of a point-of-care test to detect influenza virus infection, ensuring that the majority of followed-up households will include an index case with laboratory-confirmed influenza (98% in our study), could also preferentially detect those potential recruits with higher viral shedding and subjects with lower levels of viral shedding would be more likely to receive a false negative rapid test results, and not be recruited. However we note that statistical power would be generally increased if index cases were more infectious since we might therefore observe more secondary transmission; the limitation here relates more to generalizability. Secondly, our design results in an unavoidable delay between onset of symptoms in the index subject and the application of the intervention (Figure 2c ). If a significant amount of influenza transmission occurred prior to the intervention, we might have underestimated the efficacy of the non-pharmaceutical interventions or lacked the statistical power to find significant differences. In our analyses we investigated the SARs for those households where the intervention was applied within 36 hours of symptom onset but there was no indication of greater efficacy in this subgroup. Thirdly, there is the potential for recruited households to be biased towards including household contacts with pre-existing immunity, as discussed above. An alternative approach would have been to randomize a much larger cohort of initially uninfected households, who were then followed throughout an influenza season. However such a longitudinal study would require greater resources by several orders of magnitude than the one proposed here, due to the low attack rate of influenza.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 937, "end": 947, "text": "(Figure 2c", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, there remains a serious deficit in the evidence base of the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions.
