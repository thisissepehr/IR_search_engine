However, there is still a need for reliable disease burden estimates to provide a more detailed picture of the impact of influenza. Therefore, the objectives of this study is to estimate the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza virus infection and associated hospitalisation costs in adult patients in the Netherlands during two consecutive influenza seasons. Methods We conducted a retrospective study in adult patients with a laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection in three Dutch hospitals during respiratory seasons 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. Incidence was calculated as the weekly number of hospitalised influenza patients divided by the total population in the catchment populations of the three hospitals. Arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were estimated and included costs for emergency department consultation, diagnostics, general ward and/or intensive care unit admission, isolation, antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment. These hospitalisation costs were extrapolated to national level and expressed in 2017 euros.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The study population consisted of 380 hospitalised adult influenza patients. The seasonal cumulative incidence was 3.5 cases per 10,000 persons in respiratory season 2014-2015, compared to 1.8 cases per 10,000 persons in 2015-2016. The arithmetic mean hospitalisation cost per influenza patient was \u20ac6128 (95% CI \u20ac4934-\u20ac7737) per patient in 2014-2015 and \u20ac8280 (95% CI \u20ac6254-\u20ac10,665) in 2015-2016, potentially reaching total hospitalisation costs of \u20ac28 million in 2014-2015 and \u20ac20 million in 2015-2016. Conclusions Influenza virus infections lead to 1.8-3.5 hospitalised patients per 10,000 persons, with mean hospitalisation costs of \u20ac6100-\u20ac8300 per adult patient, resulting in 20-28 million euros annually in The Netherlands.

Unit prices for laboratory tests were retrieved form the Dutch Healthcare Authority [24] , medication prices from the National Health Care Institute [25] , and medical consultations and hospital admissions were estimated using Dutch reference prices [26] , using the weighted mean unit cost for hospital admission. The weighted mean unit cost takes into account the distribution of general ward and academic hospital beds in The Netherlands. Diagnostics for patients with an RTI on an emergency ward were assumed to include a chest X-ray and laboratory diagnostic tests, including full blood examination, respiratory viral PCR panel, and urine analysis (see supplemental file, Table S3 ). The urine analysis included a urine screening test and a pneumococcal urinary antigen test. For ICU patients, diagnostics, isolation and medication costs were already included in the total ICU admission costs. Costs for antibiotic treatment on the general ward were calculated for average antibiotic therapy course of one week in line with the most recent SWAB guidelines [18] . Different antibiotic SWAB treatment regimens on the general ward for mild and moderate severe CAP (\u03b2-lactam antibiotic) versus severe CAP (2nd/3rd generation cephalosporin) were chosen for costs estimations of antibiotic treatment [27] . Medication costs for oseltamivir on the general ward were calculated for the duration of 5 days according to SWAB guidelines. A bottom-up calculation was done for the additional costs for isolation in the first week of admission in the general ward, including residing in single rooms, additional associated workload for medical personnel, and usage of FFP1 masks [28, 29] . Arithmetic mean hospitalization costs per adult influenza patient were estimated and extrapolated to the national level. We attempted to obtain annual national hospitalization costs attributable to influenza by multiplying the estimated influenza incidence with the estimated average hospital costs per influenza patient. We could not exclude that the number of more severely affected patients, resulting in an extremely prolonged hospital stay, might have been overrepresented in our study sample.

In Canada, higher hospitalization costs per influenza patient (in 2015 euros) were found (\u20ac10,312, 95% CI \u20ac9776-\u20ac10,848). The longer arithmetic mean LOS (10.8 days) and higher in-hospital mortality (9.3%), taking into account costs for readmissions within 30 days, may also account for the difference with our study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 250, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 251, "end": 255, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 256, "end": 260, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 261, "end": 265, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 295, "end": 299, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 310, "end": 314, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 324, "end": 328, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 348, "end": 352, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Costs"}, {"text": "Differences in case definition and study population are illustrated by Dutch studies, which focused mainly on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [9, 10, 45] and invasive pneumococcal disease [10] in, respectively, an adult [9, 45] and elderly population [10] . Vissink et al. [10] reported that mean hospitalization costs of an elderly CAP patient amounted to \u20ac8081. In comparison, we found arithmetic mean influenza-related hospitalization costs of \u20ac6183 (95% CI \u20ac4937-\u20ac7625) in the same age group. The higher hospitalization costs found by Vissink et al. could be explained by their inclusion of more detailed cost data on diagnostics and treatment during admission and having an older elderly study population (56% versus 31% in our study). An additional explanation is that CAP has a great variation of causative pathogens that may result in a longer hospital stay (12.0 days versus 8.5 days in our study) and higher in-hospital mortality (11.1% versus 5.5% in our study) with consequently higher hospitalization costs. This was also illustrated by the study of Spoorenberg et al., showing that CAP caused by S. pneumoniae and S. aureus is associated with higher hospitalization costs mainly due to longer duration of hospital stay [9] . They estimated a mean hospitalization costs per CAP patient of \u20ac4098, which is lower than our hospitalization costs per influenza patient. The difference in mean hospitalization costs could be explained by the exclusion of all immunocompromised patients and a lower percentage of ICU admissions (7.5% versus 18.4% in our study) in the study by Spoorenberg et al.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 148, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 149, "end": 152, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 153, "end": 156, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 191, "end": 195, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 223, "end": 226, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 227, "end": 230, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 254, "end": 258, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 276, "end": 280, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1085, "text": "Spoorenberg et al.,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1239, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Costs"}, {"text": "The differences in hospitalization costs between the general and academic hospitals found in our study are attributed to a longer LOS in the general hospital (JBZ), mainly caused by longer length of stay on the general ward. Although we do not have a definite explanation for this result, several hypotheses could be made. Firstly, it is possible that pressure on hospital beds during influenza epidemics is higher in academic hospitals, resulting in different policies with respect to supported early discharge between the general and academic hospitals. Secondly, the amount of patient transfers to other hospitals could be higher in academic hospitals than in general hospitals. Thirdly, academic hospitals have a lower threshold for admitting immunocompromised patients, who are, therefore, less ill and require a shorter LOS, leading to lower hospitalization costs. On the other hand, general hospitals more often admit patients without significant comorbidities, but are more severely ill and require a longer LOS, with higher associated hospitalization costs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Costs"}, {"text": "Similar to the US study of Young-Xu et al. estimating costs of influenza-attributed hospitalizations [46] , we found the highest costs in the age group 45-64 years. Although higher hospitalization costs are largely driven by LOS [44] , mean LOS in our study was actually higher in the \u2265 75 age group. Nevertheless, the highest hospitalization costs per patient in the age group 45-64 years can be partly explained by the highest percentage of ICU admissions and the longest stay per admitted ICU patient. In agreement with this result, Rozenbaum et al. found the highest mean hospitalization costs per ICU patient with CAP (\u20ac16.374) in age group 50-64 years [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 101, "end": 105, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 229, "end": 233, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 658, "end": 661, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Costs"}, {"text": "The low-risk group had the highest hospitalization costs, which could largely be explained by the longest median LOS per patient and ICU days per ICU patient.

In addition, the main outlier in hospitalization costs belonged to an influenza patient in the low-risk group and in the age group 45-64 years. This influenza patient without comorbidities was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and acute renal failure, requiring dialysis. In contrast to our results, other studies [41, 42, 46] stated that underlying medical conditions contributed to an increase in total hospitalization costs for adults and elderly.

Therefore, for the first time, we could report incidence of hospitalized influenza patients in The Netherlands. Another strength is that we took differences in unit prices for admission to the general ward, in both general as academic hospital settings, into account, using weighted mean for calculation of hospitalization costs. There are also several limitations that have to be taken into account in this study. Our seasonal cumulative incidence for influenza hospitalizations is based on three Dutch hospitals, which might not be representative for the incidence and associated mean hospitalization costs in the entire Dutch population. It is also important to note that the overall arithmetic mean hospitalization costs per influenza patient are likely to be an underestimation of the true costs, caused by unavailable cost indicators. Firstly, we did not take into account patient transfers to other hospitals because of capacity problems during the influenza epidemic or readmissions of the influenza patient. This could have underestimated our mean hospitalization costs to some extent. Secondly, excluding influenza patients admitted less than 24 h, underestimated our incidence estimates and our national hospitalization costs as well; whereas, the mean hospitalization cost per admitted influenza patient was overestimated. Thirdly, 'other costs' were underestimated in our analysis, because insufficient data were collected on treatment and diagnostics during admission. To compensate for this, assumptions had to be made for the duration of isolation, empiric antibiotic therapy and duration, and oseltamivir treatment. Data on additional treatment and use of diagnostics because of complications during hospital admission were not available in our dataset and, therefore, disregarded in our cost estimate. For one severe outlier, we retrieved additional information on complications during hospital stay resulting in better insight in the mean hospitalization costs. Fourthly, no data were available on hospitalized patients with an RTI with negative influenza virus test results. Even with RT-PCR, false-negative test results may occur due to improper or poor sample collection, handling and/or processing [50] . False-negative influenza test results could have underestimated the total hospitalization costs per influenza patient. Finally, this study was purely limited to hospitalization costs. Information on healthcare use before and after hospital admission, on patient costs and related productivity losses were absent and, therefore, not considered in the current study. Extrapolation of mean hospitalization costs of influenza patients to national level is a rough estimation and has to be interpreted with caution, because the representativeness of the study hospitals is unknown and outliers could have resulted in overestimation of the total hospitalization costs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2323, "end": 2327, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strengths and limitations"}, {"text": "Influenza virus infections lead to 1.8-3.5 hospitalized patients per 10,000 persons, with mean hospitalization costs of \u20ac6100-\u20ac8300 per adult patient, resulting in 20-28 Mio. euros annually in The Netherlands.
