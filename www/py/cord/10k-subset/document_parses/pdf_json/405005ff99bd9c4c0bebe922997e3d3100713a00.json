The incidence rate was 144 episodes (95% confidence interval, 128-160) per 100 child-years. First infections appeared at a median age of 8 (interquartile range, 6.0-11.7) months. Annual seasonal peaks changing from PeV-A1 to PeV-A3 were observed. Infection was positively associated with age \u22656 months, summer season, nonexclusive breastfeeding at age <3 months, and formal childcare attendance before age 12 months. Sole PeV infections were either asymptomatic (38.4%) or mild (32.7%), while codetection with other viruses in stool swabs was common (64.4%).",

Recently, PeV-A3 seroepidemiology in Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States was shown to be similar [12] . The overall prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to PeV-A3 increased from nearly 33% in children aged 1-2 years, to 65% in those aged 5-9 years, peaking at 78% in adults aged 20-29 years, and then declining to 42% in older age groups [12] .

These have included secondary analyses of monthly stool samples collected from 3 months until 1-3 years of age in participants of 3 case-control studies from Norway and Finland. These studies were designed originally to determine the incidence of type 1 diabetes in genetically at-risk children [13] [14] [15] . By age 12 months, 43% of 108 Norwegian children recruited between 2001 and 2006 had at least 1 PeV detection, which increased to 86% by 2 years of age [13] . A similar pattern of PeV infection, but with lower incidence rates, was observed in 200 Finnish children enrolled between 1996 and 2007 where by age 12 months 22% had PeV detected in their stools on at least 1 occasion, which increased to 48% approaching their second birthday [15] . In these longitudinal cohort studies, PeV-A1 was the most commonly observed genotype (76%-93%) with PeV-A3 and PeV-A6 detected only occasionally [13] [14] [15] . Limited symptom and epidemiological risk data were reported by the 2 Norwegian studies, both of which found no association between PeV detection and respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms [13, 14] . Other studies assessed upper airway samples for various viruses, including PeV, in healthy older children and adults, but either lacked sufficient numbers or clinical or sociodemographic data to determine risk factors for PeV infections or only sampled infrequently [16] [17] [18] .",

The association between potential risk factors and PeV detection was examined using mixed-effects logistic regression with the child entered as a random effect to account for repeated measurements. Risk factors considered were age (categorized as 0-<3 months, 3-<6 months, 6-<12 months, 12-24 months), sex, exclusive breastfeeding, older siblings in the household, childcare attendance (none/informal/formal), season of PeV detection, and season of birth. Given the strong association between breastfeeding and childcare with age, both breastfeeding-by-age and childcare-by-age interaction terms were included in the models. All variables (except sex) were analyzed as time-varying variables. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. In multivariable analyses, all variables were included in the regression models. A linear regression model was used to investigate the association between symptoms and PeV cycle threshold (Ct) values, with the latter being inversely proportional to the amplified target nucleic acid in the sample, representing a semiquantitative estimate of viral load. Ct values from the first PeV detection in each episode were analyzed. Data were analyzed using Stata version 15.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).",

However, the RT-PCR studies relied upon clinical samples, which may bias the PeV detection ages as PeV-A3 is associated primarily with disease before age 3 months [2, 3, 5, 7, 11] . Unlike stools, PeV was detected rarely in nasal swabs (0.2%) and was always associated with a PeV-positive stool of the same genotype, supporting fecal-oral as one transmission route. Previous community-based studies reported higher PeV detection rates (4%-9%) in respiratory samples from asymptomatic subjects [16, 18] , possibly resulting from different sampling techniques (gargle and nasopharyngeal swabs). In contrast, infants hospitalized in Brisbane with PeV-A3-associated sepsis had high and comparable positive nasopharyngeal swab (86.2%) and stool (88.9%) detection rates [19] . Given the asymptomatic or mild nature of cases in our study, this observed discrepancy with hospitalized infant PeV detection rates is likely a reflection of more severe systemic disease.",

This coincided with the outbreak of PeV-A3-associated sepsis in Australian infants [5, 19] , and aligns with the predicted timing of a genomic recombination event leading to a more virulent phenotype [28] . Nevertheless, in our cohort PeV-A3 was not associated with severe symptoms, even when detected during the outbreak period or within the high-risk first 3 months of life. Case-control studies [32] and the sharp increase in PeV infections after age 3 months in our cohort suggest maternal antibody protection against PeV-related disease early in life. Thus, emergence of a novel recombinant PeV-A3 strain and declining PeV-A3 neutralizing antibodies in women of childbearing age at a population level may contribute to the biennial outbreaks in Australian infants [12, 32] .",

Although completion rates were excellent for such a demanding study, not all diaries and swabs were returned. Finally, the 2 genotyping regions used in this study are highly conserved within the genome and may not reflect the true genetic diversity shown by the PeV-A3 recombinant variant associated with sepsis [28] . The sharp increase in ORChID PeV-A3 cases observed during the first PeV-A3 outbreak [19] suggests this recombinant variant was circulating within the community.",

            "text": "In summary, ORChID extends previous limited seroprevalence and community-based surveys by confirming that PeV infections from multiple genotypes are common during the first 2 years of life, with virus shedding primarily through the fecal route. Prolonged PeV shedding is from sequential infections with different genotypes rather than a single virus episode. Annual outbreaks occurred in the summer/autumn months with the severe disease-associated PeV-A3 succeeding PeV-A1 as the predominant strain in the 2013-2014 season, but it and other PeV infections were typically asymptomatic or associated with mild ARI or AGE symptoms. Despite participants being predominantly from advantaged families, which may limit the extrapolation of findings to lower socioeconomic settings, these observations illustrate the value of unselected, high-resolution longitudinal community-based cohort studies helping to identify the overall epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical features associated with infection rather than focusing exclusively upon the few cases with severe disease.",
