The hydrophobic Leu142 is replaced by an arginine. In particular, replacement of Ala138 in USP18 by a polar residue in other USPs might block the access of the bulky and hydrophobic Trp121 side chain of ISG15 (Fig. 4d) . In contrast to IBB-1, IBB-2, located on blocking loop 1, mediates hydrogen-bond interactions with ISG15 ( Fig. 4e) . The corresponding blocking loop in USP7 is extended by two residues and adopts a conformation incompatible with ISG15 or ubiquitin binding. No hydrogen bonds are formed between USP7 and ubiquitin in this region (Fig. 4f) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 362, "end": 371, "text": "(Fig. 4c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 493, "end": 502, "text": "(Fig. 4c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 946, "end": 955, "text": "(Fig. 4d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1072, "text": "Fig. 4e)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1286, "end": 1295, "text": "(Fig. 4f)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "IBB-1 and IBB-2"}, {"text": "To evaluate the roles of IBB-1 and IBB-2, we created USP18 variants bearing the respective residues of USP7.

Likewise, we generated an ISG15 variant bearing an arginine residue instead of Trp121 (ISG15 W121R), as well as a variant in which Trp121, Pro128 and His149 of ISG15 were changed to the corresponding residues of ubiquitin (ISG15 W121R P128G H149V). The interaction of mouse USP18 with ISG15 and several variants was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; binding curves and parameters in Supplementary Fig. 5) . ISG15 bound to immobilized USP18 with a high affinity characterized by a fast association and dissociation phase. The K d of 1.49 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5M (mean \u00b1 s.d.) is in good agreement with the K d of 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M determined previously by microscale thermophoresis 28 . Changing the residues in IBB-1 to the corresponding residues of USP7 (variant USP18 IBB-1-USP7 ), or making To analyze the effects of changes in IBB-1 and IBB-2 on the catalytic activity of the enzyme, all three variants of mouse USP18 were tested for covalent adduct formation with ISG15-PA, ct-ISG15-PA and Ub-PA 44 . Wild-type (WT) USP18 reacted readily with ISG15-PA and ct-ISG15-PA within 1 min. In contrast, USP18 IBB-1-USP7 formed no adduct, even after 5 min. The covalent adduct was observed only after prolonged incubation (Fig. 5a) . USP18 IBB-2-USP7 reacted almost as rapidly as WT, but completion of the reaction was impaired, as indicated by the presence of unreacted USP18. Strikingly, mutation of both IBBs in USP18 IBB-1-USP7-IBB-2-USP7 completely abolished covalent-complex formation (Fig. 5a) . Notably, neither WT USP18 nor the USP18 variants reacted with Ub-PA, even after prolonged incubation (Supplementary Fig. 6a) . As shown by multiple sequence alignments, IBB-1 and IBB-2 are well conserved among mammalians (Supplementary Fig. 7) . To evaluate whether human USP18 recognizes the ISG15-like mouse USP18, we built a 3D model of the human USP18-ISG15 complex on the basis of the structure of the mouse USP18-ISG15 complex. As expected, the interaction surfaces are complementary, and the model suggests that IBB-1 of human USP18 is crucial for reactivity (data not shown). To evaluate these observations, we expressed and purified human USP18 and generated a human ISG15-PA probe. Because the interaction surfaces in the USP18-ISG15 complex are well conserved between human and mouse proteins, we tested whether the ISG15-PA active site probes would label USP18 across species.

For USP18 IBB-1-USP7 , only minor residual catalytic activity was observed (0.5% of WT activity), whereas USP18 IBB-2-USP7 still cleaved the model substrate but did so with a lower efficiency than that of USP18 WT (65% of WT activity).

Likewise, the corresponding counterpart in ISG15, which carries the bulky tryptophan protruding from the surface, is also highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. 8) . Thus, the hydrophobic interaction described here appears to be strictly conserved among different species. In particular, IBB-1 of USP18 and the hydrophobic patch of ISG15 are among the most conserved regions between these proteins. A similar degree of conservation was observed for only the catalytic cleft of USP18 and the C-terminal tail of ISG15 (Supplementary Figs. 7b and 8b) . In contrast, instead of carrying the two hydrophobic residues Ala138 and Leu142 (Mus musculus numbering), fish USP18 carries an aspartate and a histidine residue at the corresponding positions ( Supplementary  Fig. 7a ). Most interestingly, in fish ISG15, these variations are compensated by an exchange of the hydrophobic Trp121 and Pro128 (M. musculus numbering) to the polar residues arginine and glutamine, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 8a) . A molecular model of a USP18-ISG15 complex bearing these mutations suggests that the side chains of these polar residues can form several hydrogen bonds. This type of interaction is reminiscent of the interactions between other USPs and ubiquitin. Thus, we speculated that fish USP18 might not be restricted to ISG15 but may also be able to recognize ubiquitin. To test this hypothesis, we expressed USP18 from Danio rerio in HEK 293T cells and analyzed the cell lysates for reactivity with ISG15-and Ub-reactive probes (Fig. 6a) . USP18 from D. rerio reacted readily with mouse ISG15-PA (Fig. 6b) . Most interestingly, USP18 from D. rerio reacted with not only ISG15-PA but also mammalian Ub-PA, whereas mouse USP18 showed no cross-reactivity with Ub (Fig. 6c) , as previously reported 28 . Although the portion of covalent modification of USP18 from D. rerio with Ub appeared to be less than that with ISG15, the modification was clearly visible and was not observed when the active site cysteine was mutated to alanine (Fig. 6c) . These data further support that the IBB-1 region is critical for ISG15 specificity. 5  1  40  5  1  40  5  1  40  5  1  40  40  40  5  1  40  5  1  40  5  1  40  5  1  40  40  40 Time ( with an ISG15 protease is currently available. Our analysis demonstrates that only the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 is sufficient for USP18 binding and activity. Moreover, we identified the structural determinants essential for the extraordinary substrate specificity of USP18. We mapped two regions, IBB-1 and IBB-2, which are unique to USP18 and recognize regions that are present in the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 but are absent in ubiquitin. Analysis of sitespecific variants showed that IBB-1 is the major determinant of ISG15 cleavage, whereas IBB-2 has only minor contributions. This result is also reflected in the conservation of IBB-1 across different species. Whereas these residues are strictly conserved in IBB-1 in mammals, fish USP18 shows no conservation within IBB-1. Our results suggest that fish USP18 is a DUB cross-reactive with ubiquitin and ISG15. Furthermore, the IBB-1 region in fish USP18 has characteristics of ubiquitin-specific DUBs and lacks the two hydrophobic amino acids characteristic of IBB-1 of USP18.

A more drastic decrease in affinity was observed for USP18 IBB-1-USP7-IBB-2-USP7 , which contained both changes. To validate these results, we also analyzed variants of ISG15 with changes in the residues interacting with IBB-1 of USP18. The exchange of Trp121 in ISG15 to the corresponding arginine of Ub (variant ISG15 W121R) caused a clear decrease in affinity, and mutation of all three interacting residues, Trp121, Pro128 and His149 (variant ISG15 W121R P128G H149V), almost completely abolished the interaction with USP18. Likewise, the observed binding ratio of ISG15 per immobilized USP18 decreased to 0.4 when Trp121 was mutated, and no clear stoichiometry of binding could be obtained for the variant ISG15 W121R P128G H149V, thus indicating that the observed binding might be due to a residual unspecific interaction.

In addition, some USPs show crossreactivity toward ISG15 (ref.26). To ensure specific functions of the different USPs, most enzymes of the USP family have additional large domains mediating interaction with other protein complexes 47 or specific organelles48 , or they show temporal distributions49 . In contrast, USP18 is a notably small member, which comprises only the USP core domain. Nevertheless, USP18 is specific for ISG15 and is not cross-reactive toward ubiquitin or any other member of the Ubl family28,29 . Thus, the unique specificity must arise entirely from the USP core domain itself. Models based on structures of the isopeptidases USP21 (ref.27) and the viral SARS CoV PLpro 50 , both of which cleave ISG15 and ubiquitin, suggest that USP18 might recognize both Ubl domains of ISG15. In the USP21-di-Ub complex, the N-terminal Ub domain is in contact with the finger domain. In the SARS CoV PLpro, binding of the N-terminal Ubl domain to the thumb domain has been observed.
