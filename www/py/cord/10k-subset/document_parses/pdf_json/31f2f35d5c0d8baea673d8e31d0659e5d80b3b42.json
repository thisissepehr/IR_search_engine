Design: Clinical study of a series of cases. Patients and participants: 11 previously healthy children with septic shock admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. Interventions: None. Measurements and results: Oxygen consumption, oxygen delivery (DO 2 ), serum bicarbonate, arterial pH, gastric intramucosal pH (pHi), gastroarterial carbon dioxide tension gradient, serum lactate, pyruvate, lactate to pyruvate ratio (L/P), ketone body ratio, and the esterified to free carnitine ratio were measured serially at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after admission to the pediatric ICU.

One patient presented an increasingly abnormal L/ P ratio with normal lactate levels, suggesting an increased utilization of pyruvate rather than an increased cytosolic redox potential. Although values of gastric pHi < 7.30 were observed in 43 % of samples, serial measurements in individuals showed significant variability and unpredictable trends. Free fatty acid concentrations, ketone body production, and carnitine levels remained within the normal range. Conclusions: In this study, trends in serum bicarbonate and lactate somewhat characterized the recovery of children with septic shock. Based on our data, it is unclear how other markers may have been used to modify therapy. ation parameters may characterize survivors of sepsis [7, 8] . The value of serum lactate as evidence of anaerobic metabolism and critical oxygen delivery has been questionned [6] . However, persistently increased blood lactate levels may also help to identify nonsurvivors of severe sepsis [9] . It has been proposed that the redox potential of cytosol and that of liver mitochondria may be evaluated by the lactate to pyruvate (L/P) ratio and the ketone body ratio, 3-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratio (3OHB/AA), respectively. These are excellent indicators of the adequacy of cellular oxygenation in vitro [5, 10] , but they have not been extensively studied in humans with sepsis [11] . In fact, there are few data on the production of ketone bodies and related carnitine metabolism in this population. Finally, it has been recently reported that gastric tonometry may predict mortality among adults with sepsis [9, 12, 13] and that the measurement of interstitial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2 ) may reflect regional splanchnic hypoperfusion and/or hypoxia [12, 13] .

The figure shows that serum lactate levels rapidly normalized over time in all individuals. The lactate to pyruvate (L/P) ratio displayed significant variability over the study period. One child (closed triangle) presented increasingly abnormal values of L/P ratio at normal lactate levels while he was recovering from sepsis ICU stay was 8 7 days. The use of dopamine or dobutamine alone (15 mg/kg per min) was required in 3 children, dopamine and dobutamine (15\u00b120 mg/kg per min, 10\u00b115 mg/kg per min, respectively) were required in 2 patients, and 6 children were treated with three vasopressors (dopamine 15\u00b125 mg/kg per min, dobutamine 10\u00b143 mg/kg per min, and epinephrine 0.2\u00b10.7 mg/kg per min). All patients were survivors from pediatric ICU. VO 2 , DO 2 , arterial pH (pHa), and levels of serum bicarbonate are presented in Fig. 1 . The figure shows that large variations were observed for both VO 2 and DO 2 . We noted unexpected values of VO 2 < 100 ml/min per m 2 at the end of the study in 3 patients. However, supranormal levels of DO 2 ( > 570 ml/min per m 2 ) [8] were observed in 7 of 8 patients, accounting for 56 % (18/32) of DO 2 measurements. Only 23 % (13/57) of pHa measurements were lower than 7.35; this was secondary to high minute ventilation induced by mechanical ventilation (data not shown). Overall, the steadily increasing values of serum bicarbonate reflected well patients' recovery from septic shock. Levels of serum lactate and pyruvate and the L/P ratio are presented in Fig. 2 . The figure shows that serum lactate levels rapidly normalized over time in all individuals. We noted abnormal levels of lactate in 29 % (15/53) of samples and of L/P in 27 % (14/53) (normal lactate < 1.8 mmol/l, L/P 16 5 [28] ). Increasingly abnormal values for the L/P ratio were noted at normal lactate levels in 1 patient who was recovering, suggesting increased pyruvate utilization. Nevertheless, upon admission, the L/P ratio was significantly inversely correlated with VO 2 (r 2 = \u00b10.8; p = 0.02) and with pHi (r 2 = \u00b10.5; p = 0.03). Regional markers of splanchnic hypoperfusion are presented in Fig. 3 . The figure shows that both DPtCO 2 -PaCO 2 and gastric pHi displayed significant variability over time with unpredictable trends in individual measurements within the first 24 h. We noted abnormal levels of pHi in 72 % (38/53) of samples and of DPtCO 2 -PaCO 2 in 78 % (41/53) of samples (normal pHi < 7.35 [14, 15] , DPtCO 2 -PaCO 2 < 7 mmHg [29] ).
