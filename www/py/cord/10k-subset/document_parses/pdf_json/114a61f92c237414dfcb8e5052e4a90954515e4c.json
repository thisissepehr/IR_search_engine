Use of other alkylating agents and etoposide may also increase the risk of HC. When cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide is metabolised in the body, it produces a metabolite called acrolein. Acrolein will cause direct toxicity to the inner lining of the urinary tract, the urothelium. The degree of damage is dose dependent, and the toxicity may increase with previous or concomitant radiation therapy and if busulfan is included in the conditioning regimen together with cyclophosphamide. The time of duration that acrolein is exposed to the bladder also contributes to the degree of damage. For cyclophosphamide, the maximal concentration of active metabolites is reached after 2-4 h of oral or intravenous administration. Most of the cyclophosphamide, 35-80% of the dose, is excreted in the urine as metabolites, and up to 20% is excreted as intact drug (Hassan and Ljungman 2003) . In patients with decreased renal function, particularly in severe cases, decreased renal excretion may result in increased plasma levels of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites.

The damaged urothelial cells provide a milieu for viral replication. Immunosuppression leads to viral reactivation and causes viruria. However, the exact pathogenetic link between BKV and HC remains enigmatic. Other viral agents such as adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other polyomaviruses similar to BKV may also but less often cause HC.
