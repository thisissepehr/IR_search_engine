OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to describe how individual and contextual challenges can impact compassion within critical care and palliative care settings. DESIGN: This qualitative study adopted phenomenology and autoethnography to inform data collection, and principles of activity theory and realist inquiry for data interpretation. PARTICIPANTS: Five clinicians who work in critical care (n = 3) and palliative care (n = 3) participated in the study. APPROACH: Qualitative data were obtained from ethnographic observations, interviews, and focus groups. Participants observed and recorded field notes (n = 53) on instances of suffering and compassion in their workplace settings. At the end of the study period, they participated in a focus group or individual interview to reflect on their experiences.

Contextual constraints consisted of situational pressures, the clinical environment, gaps in education, and organizational culture. The distribution of compassion within teams and how teams adapt their behaviors in response to perceived needs for greater compassion modulated these challenges.

We found that it was the emergent interplay of these factors that modified expressions of compassion rather than individual and independent interactions between single factor and expression of compassion. While these factors describe how expressions of compassion are modified, we also found that many clinicians dynamically responded to fill perceived gaps in others' expressions of compassion. Our findings advance our understanding of how compassion can be shaped and constrained, and how clinicians adapt their expressions of compassion in response to gaps in others' actions and behaviors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We found both individual and team-based challenges to compassion. This contrasts with discourses of compassion in healthcare that have focused on compassion in relation to a single clinician, 15 rather than upon the contexts in which they are working.

Identifying these challenges provides a framework through which individuals, teams, and organizations can examine their own practices and work settings to identify how compassion could be enhanced. For example, feedback and coaching may facilitate better alignment between intentions and perceptions, and fostering continuity of care could be considered in clinician scheduling. Awareness of the multiple factors influencing compassion might also help team members have compassion for one another and facilitate self-compassion when the ideals of clinical care have not been realized in practice. Compassion has in some ways become a \"god-term\" subordinate to other aspects of care and an \"ultimate motive\" accepted at face value and not questioned. 17 Yet, compassion may be marbled and layered. Our study identified limits to compassion and the unintended suffering that may occur within actions intended to express compassion. While clinicians do not intend to cause suffering, compassion unfolds through interactions between people with different worldviews and priorities; what is experienced may not be as intended. Through witnessing suffering, feeling powerless to relieve suffering, and at times unintentionally contributing to suffering, clinicians may suffer themselves. 18, 19 And from a systems perspective where resources are finite, spending more time with one patient may limit time spent with another. We are not advocating that compassion be avoided, but rather draw attention to these unintended consequences so that they can be anticipated and their effect mitigated. For example, resilience training, contemplative practices, and peer support may prevent or reduce the impact of vicarious trauma and burnout. 20 We were surprised to discover the extent to which compassion can be distributed between team members rather than being the responsibility of a single individual. When compassion is both an individual and team endeavor, monitoring and reflecting upon individual and team behaviors becomes a shared pursuit that could modulate some of the challenges of compassion. Awareness of what makes compassion difficult could help clinicians proactively identify when they do not have the capacity for compassion and ask a colleague to devote more attention towards compassion. Similarly, when teams notice constraining factors, they can be more intentional in enacting compassion, more vigilant for gaps in compassion, and more prepared to fill in gaps. These concepts of teamwork have previously been described within the general teamwork literature as mutual performance monitoring, backup behavior, and adaptability, 21 and have been applied to managing emergency medical situations. 22 The patient safety literature also considers the collective competence of a team in addition to individual performance. 23 To our knowledge, how these concepts of teamwork could apply to the relational dimensions of medicine has not previously been considered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 202, "end": 204, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1237, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1767, "end": 1770, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1773, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2217, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3127, "end": 3129, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3194, "end": 3196, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3317, "end": 3319, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Including compassion as one of the many aims that a team strives to achieve has implications.
