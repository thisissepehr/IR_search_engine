BmNPV often causes silkworm diseases and results in substantial economic losses for silkworm industry; thus it is an important task to effectively prevent and cure silkworm diseases caused by BmNPV. In the insect host cells, the expression of the viral gene and the replication of viral DNA occurred in a series cascade. The infection course of BmNPV depends on the adjustment and expression of hundreds of viral genes. Phase characteristics of virus gene transcription and cascade regulation of virus gene expression mainly accomplish at the level of transcription; that is to say, the production of the expression in the former phase will directly or indirectly influence that in the next phase through trans-acting. DNA polymerase and DNA helicase of BmNPV are indispensable genes of the viral DNA replication process and they all belong to early expressed genes, the expression of which does not require the existence of other gene products. If we can block and destroy these two genes' expression, we can theoretically inhibit the replication of viral DNA.",

The phenomenon of RNAi has been observed in various species including plants, fungi, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells [1, 2] . RNAi has been shown to protect against invading genetic elements such as transposons, transgenes and viruses, which potentially share a long dsRNA trigger. RNAi is a cellular process of gene silencing. The initial dsRNA is processed by the Dicer RNase into short fragments of 21 23 nt in length in an ATP-dependent manner [3 5] . These short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) then incorporate ribonuclease compound into dsRNA-inducing silencing complex (RISC) to guide cycles of specific RNA degradation. The siRNA thus acts as a guide, restricting the ribonuclesae to cleavage of RNAs only which are complementary to one of the siRNA strands. Therefore, the specificity of this defense mechanism is based on nucleic acid base pairing between siRNA and its target RNA [6 8] . RNAi often occurs at the post-transcription stage, so it is usually described as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS).",

This model of antivirus will offer an experimental basis and technical insight into the research on plant virus prevention and human virus disease therapeutics.

Fig. 3 shows that total DNA of normal silkworm cells as a positive contrast had no hybrid signal; however, total DNA of infected cells, which transfected A p2 or A H had a very weak hybrid signal by contrast with the negative contrast (dot 1). The quantity of viral DNA in dot 3 and dot 4 reduced 72.3% and 63.4% compared with negative contrast by gel imaging system. Results indicated that A p2 and A H can effectively block the replication of BmNPV. ( ) The distribution of introduced dsRNA in cells. One way to further understand the mechanism of RNAi is to track the introduced dsRNA in live cells. Scientists found that the incorporation of a fluorophore into dsRNA would not affect its ability to induce gene silencing and had no cytotoxic effect associated with the fluorescent moiety [10] . So FAM-labeled dsRNAs were transfected into silkworm cells and observed by fluorescence microscopy to determine their subcellular distribution pattern (Fig. 4) . 4 h after transfection, a majority of transfected dsRNA remains in lipid vessels and no fluorescence could be seen in karyons. However, after 24 h, the dsRNA had dissociated from its lipid carrier and appeared to be localized discretely in the cytoplasm in close proximity to the nuclear membrane. 48 h after transfection, more fluorescence could be seen in karyons. This location was very similar to what was previously reported for siRNA in mammalian cells [10] . Finally, time course showed that the labeled dsRNAs were maintained in cultured silkworm cells for up to 5 d. After 6 d, the signal was too weak to be detected.",

This indicates that there is an uncertainty in the design of dsRNA; the inhibitive effect on different regions of target genes can be very different. By studying the inhibitive effect on viruses by various doses of dsRNA after transfection, we discovered that Ap 2 and A H have two very distinctive characteristics, as explained below:",

Not only it can raise the effect of the reaction system but also counteract the effect of ADARs (RNA-dependent adenylate deaminase) [11] , so it can enhance the effect on inhibition. However, the effectiveness will be impaired if the concentration exceeds a certain level (e.g. 4 Pg/well). The reasons may be that the excess dsRNA will firstly produce an over-abundance of siRNA, which remains in the cells after cell division. This could disturb the response of RNAi in other cells by competing with other dsRNAs to combine with RNAi-specific enzymes. Secondly, when the dosage of dsRNA is raised, the quantity of TransMessenger transfection reagent needed in transfection will be increased, whereas the test of MTT indicated that transfection reagent had a toxic effect on cells when its dosage exceeded 32 PL. So the effect of RNAi was impaired.",

Because we used instantaneous transfection with dsRNAs in silkworm cells, there was a homeostasis between the production and degradation of mRNA while RNAi was taking place. At the same time, RNAi would be inhibited due to the decrease in the generation of siRNA caused by the gradual increase in the active deamination of ADAR S . This will result in a rise in the virus titer. Therefore, our plan was to establish a plasmid vector, in which we used the promoter of RNA polymerase (e.g. U6, H1) to express dsRNA or siRNA in cells [12] , so the concentration of siRNA in cells would remain stable. This can not only significantly decrease the cost, but also improve the operability of RNAi technology, and ultimately enhance its inhibitive effect. In addition, we discovered an apparent difference between the amount of dsRNA utilized in our experiments and the amount of usage documented in ref. [13] . This may be due to the fact that different types of cell or virus have different sensitivities to dsRNA.",

However, this inhibitory effect differed slightly from that previously seen in Drosophila S2 cells. In S2 cells, the inhibition of gene expression induced by dsRNA was in the order of 70% 100% [14] .
