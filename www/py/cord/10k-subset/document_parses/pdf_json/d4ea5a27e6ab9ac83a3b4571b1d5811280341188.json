            "text": "Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (2008): 111-115 | Recombinant fusion protein is widely used as an antigen to raise antibodies against the epitope of a target protein. However, the concomitant anticarrier antibody in resulting antiserum reduces the production of the desired antibody and brings about unwanted non-specific immune reactions. It is proposed that the carrier protein transgenic animal could be used to solve this problem. To validate this hypothesis, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgenic mice were produced. By immunizing the mice with fusion protein His6HAtag-EGFP, we showed that the antiserum from the transgenic mice had higher titer antibody against His6HA tag and lower titer antibody against EGFP compared with that from wild-type mice. Therefore, this report describes an improved method to raise high titer antipeptide polyclonal antibody using EGFP transgenic mice that could have application potential in antibody preparation.",

            "text": "Antibodies are widely used in life science research and clinical applications. In raising antibodies, antigen is often prepared by coupling the antigen peptide to a carrier protein, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] or bovine serum albumin [6, 7] . In this case, the immunogenicity of the short target peptide is enhanced due to the enlargement of the antigen molecule, but it is a laborious process. Recombinant fusion proteins, using maltose-binding protein [8, 9] and glutathione S-transferase (GST) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] as the carrier proteins, have also been adopted to raise antibody. The fusion proteins are easy to acquire with recombinant DNA technology and purified by well-established affinity chromatography methods. However, the majority of antibody components in the antiserum generated by these methods are against the carrier proteins [15, 16] . Therefore, the titer of the desired antibody is often low and a nonspecific effect might exist. To avoid this problem, the synthetic high-density multiple antigenic peptide system has been applied to raise antipeptide antibody [17, 18] . Although there is no anticarrier antibody in the antiserum, the use of the multiple antigenic peptide system is limited to very short peptides because of the space tendency of the branched multiple antigenic peptides [19] .",

The purified proteins His6HAtag-GST and GST-EGFP were used for detection of the antibody titer against His6HAtag and EGFP [ Fig. 2(A) ]. The corresponding plasmids were named p6HHA-GST and pGST-EGFP, respectively. The purified fusion proteins were separated by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [ Fig. 2(B) ]. The purity of the proteins was estimated to be approximately 90% for His6HAtag-EGFP and 85% for His6HAtag-GST. EGFP transgenic mice generated higher titer polyclonal antibody against His6HAtag with a reduced titer of anti-EGFP EGFP is the auto-antigen for EGFP transgenic mice, as pre-immune sera from EGFP transgenic mice did not give positive reactions to GST-EGFP (data not shown). After immunization with purified protein His6HAtag-EGFP, the antisera from EGFP transgenic mice and wild-type mice were titered against His6HAtag-GST and GST-EGFP, respectively, by ELISA. The results showed that the titer of the antiserum against His6HAtag-GST protein was raised to approximately 5300 for EGFP transgenic mice, and to approximately 2600 for wild-type mice [ Fig. 3(A) ]. As for the titer of antiserum against GST-EGFP protein, EGFP transgenic mice showed the average titer of 6500, whereas wild-type mice showed a titer of 15,000 [ Fig. 3(B) ]. The target/carrier ratio (the antiserum titer of anti-His6HAtag to that of anti-EGFP protein) of the transgenic mice was significantly higher than that of wild-type mice [ Fig. 3(C) ].",
