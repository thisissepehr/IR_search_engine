CDV causes a multifocal demyelinating disease in dogs. The mechanism of demyelination in distemper has been subject of several studies [17] . There is no doubt that the initial demyelinating lesion in distemper is directly virus induced, since there is a clear correlation between the occurrence of demyelination and CDV replication in the cells of the white matter [20] . However, ultrastructural studies generally agree that there is little evidence for oligodendroglial infection, the obvious explanation for the phenomenon of demyelination. Indirect evidence for oligodendroglial impairment in acute lesions is the observation of segmental demyelination and of ultrastructural pathological changes of oligodendrocytes [11, 16] . Such changes in oligodendrocytes had been reported earlier in vitro using primary canine brain cell cultures [24, 25] . These cultures have been extensively used to study viral tropism. These in vitro studies showed that -in contrast to other cells such as astrocytes and macrophages -oligodendrocytes hardly express CDV protein [27] . However, we could show that these cells underwent a restricted infection with transcription of CDV RNA, and that this phenomenon correlated with down-regulation of myelin gene transcription, presumably the underlying reason for degeneration of these cells [9] . Although infection of primary dog brain cell cultures with virulent CDV closely mimics the infection in the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo, extrapolation of in vitro findings to the disease in vivo has to be viewed with caution. The extension of the in vitro findings in vivo has so far been obscured by the lack of reliable oligodendrocyte labelling techniques in canine brain tissue sections, in contrast to cultured canine oligodendrocytes which can be specifically labelled by a wide variety of antibodies [22, 23] . The advent of in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques for demonstrating oligodendrocytes on paraffin sections [1, 4] opened a new avenue to investigate oligodendrocytes in vivo.

Considering the large number of oligodendrocytes in the canine white matter, systematic lysis of these cells could not have escaped our attention.

In the present study we applied extensive double-labelling techniques to establish a direct correlation between demyelination and oligodendrocyte infection. Because of the marked downregulation of myelin gene transcription in the lesions, the usefulness of the ISH technique to identify oligodendrocytes on the basis of PLP mRNA expression in doublelabelling experiments was reduced in demyelinating lesions. On the other hand, the demonstration of small quantities of CDV mRNA may be difficult in the very early stages of infection, preceding demyelination. Despite this rather narrow \"window\", by systematically screening the periphery of demyelinating plaques and investigating infected white matter areas in which demyelination and PLP down-regulation had not yet occurred, we did find infected oligodendrocytes. The number of oligodendrocytes expressing CDV protein was exceedingly low. This was not unexpected in view of the above-mentioned electron microscopical studies [7, 16] and CDV infection experiments in brain cell cultures [24] . However, the number of oligodendrocytes expressing viral RNA was much higher than CDV protein-expressing oligodendrocytes. This finding confirms that restricted infection of oligodendrocytes also occurs in vivo, as already described for cultured oligodendrocytes [27] . This is not surprising, since our previous studies showed evidence for restricted infection in neurons in distemper in vivo [13] . This finding has been confirmed by others [14] and restricted infection in CNS cells has been reported since in other viral systems [5] . It is possible that cell-specific factors such as MxA proteins control such events [15] . While this study confirms restricted oligodendrocyte infection in vivo, which we pre-viously found in vitro, its causal relationship to down-regulation of myelin gene transcription and demyelination is not as apparent in vivo as it was in vitro [9] . Demyelination in distemper lesions is complete and all oligodendrocytes in a focus are affected, as shown in the present study. Yet the number of CDV mRNA-expressing oligodendrocytes found in infected but not yet demyelinated areas seems -with 8% of all oligodendrocytes in the infected area -rather small to explain ensuing demyelination. We found that the number of oligodendrocytes in canine white matter at least matches the number of astrocytes. Therefore, if myelin gene down-regulation were to be due to restricted infection, one would also expect a significant number of cells expressing only viral mRNA but no CDV protein in fully demyelinated lesions, in which oligodendrocytes are no longer detected by ISH techniques. However, the total number of cells in demyelinated areas showing restricted infection, as seen on double labelling for CDV protein and mRNA, was of the same order of magnitude as the number of restrictively infected oligodendrocytes found in infected but not yet demyelinated areas. It appears, therefore, that oligodendrocytes do not easily support CDV infection, in contrast to astrocytes, in which very strong signals for transcription and translation of CDV were obtained.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1128, "end": 1131, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1135, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1193, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1463, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1594, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1643, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1732, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1822, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2073, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we have shown that CDV infection leads to massive down-regulation of myelin gene expression in demyelinating lesions and that this effect correlates in part with restricted infection of oligodendrocytes. However, we could not establish a full correlation between demyelination and oligodendrocyte infection in the quantitative sense. It is possible that minimal CDV transcription, which is below the limit of detection of the methods used, already suffices to shut down the oligodendroglial metabolic machinery. Alternatively, an indirect mechanism could play a role in oligodendrocyte dysfunction. It is known that these cells are dependent on other cell types for their survival [12] . Even though CDV is a non-cytolytic virus, the massive viral load in myelinated areas could perhaps lead to impairment of supportive functions of these other cell types.
