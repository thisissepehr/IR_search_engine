VE-cadherin was metabolically radiolabeled with D-[6-3 H]glucosamine, isolated by immunoprecipitation, purified by SDS-PAGE and in-gel digested with endoproteinase Asp N. Oligosaccharides were sequentially released from resulting glycopeptides and analyzed by chromatographic profiling. The results revealed that VE-cadherin carries predominantly sialylated diantennary and hybrid-type glycans in addition to some triantennary and high mannose-type species. Highly branched, tetraantennary oligosaccharides were found in trace amounts only. Immunohistochemical labeling of VE-cadherin and sialic acids displayed a codistribution along the intercellular junctions in endothelial cells of human umbilical arteries, veins, and cultured endothelial monolayers. Ca 2+ -depletion, performed on cultured endothelial cells, resulted in a reversible complete disappearance of VE-cadherin and of almost all sialic acid staining from the junctions. Sialidase treatment of whole cells caused a change of VE-cadherin immunofluorescence from a continuous and netlike superstructural organization to a scattered inconsistent one. Hence, cell surface sialic acids might play a role in VE-cadherin organization.",

            "text": "The vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) is endothelium specific (Suzuki et al., 1991; Lampugnani et al., 1992) and belongs to endothelial adherens junctions that are commonly found in endothelium of all locations in situ and in culture (Simionescu et al., 1975; Simionescu et al., 1976; Franke et al., 1988 Franke et al., , 1989 . Ca 2+ -dependent cadherins are integral membrane proteins that consist of a large amino-terminal extracellular domain (ectodomain) with five repeats, one membrane spanning domain and a short carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Takeichi, 1995) . The extracellular domains probably occur as parallel \"strand dimers\" by which the terminal repeat of the extracellular domain binds to cadherins of adjacent cells (antiparallel \"adhesion dimers\") forming a zipper-like cell-to-cell connection (Shapiro et al., 1995a,b) . Cadherins are linked to cytoplasmic actin filaments via \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-catenin (plakoglobin) (reviewed in Jou et al., 1995; Klymkowsky and Parr, 1995; Takeichi, 1995; Aberle et al., 1996; Yap et al., 1997) . The cadherin/catenin complex of the epithelium and endothelium contributes to tissue organization and maintenance in developing and adult organisms (for review, see Dejana et al., 1995; Klymkowsky and Parr, 1995; Takeichi, 1995; Aberle et al., 1996; Yap et al., 1997) . In endothelial cells, the cadherin/catenin complex seems to be crucially involved in certain physiological and pathophysiological reactions such as regulation of permeability, extravasation of leukocytes and tumor cells, as well as cell migration and resistance to fluid shear stress (Lampugnani et al., 1992 (Lampugnani et al., , 1997 Dejana, 1996; Del Maschio et al., 1996; Feldmann et al., 1996; Rabiet et al., 1996; Levalle et al., 1997; Schnittler et al., 1997; Moll et al., 1998; Schnittler and Feldmann, 1998) .",

Treatment with PNGase F resulted in a shift of the VE-cadherin band from about 135 kDa to about 90 kDa (arrow) in agreement with the expected molecular mass calculated from its amino acid sequence (Figure 2 , lane 3). The second band (dotted line) is assumed to represent a degradation product. Incubation with endo H also led to a small but significant shift in the electrophoretic mobility of this glycoprotein ( Figure 2 , lane 5). Therefore, isolated glycopeptides were first treated with endo H. Oligosaccharides released were separated from residual glycopeptides by reverse-phase (RP-) HPLC. Endo H-resistant glycopeptides were incubated with PNGase F. The resulting reaction mixture was again subjected to RP-HPLC to isolate free glycans. Approximately 16% and 73% of total radioactivity were released by the two enzymes. Residual 11% of radioactivity, still eluting in the peptide fraction, could be shown to comprise exclusively N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and no N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and are, therefore, assumed to result from the innermost GlcNAc residue(s) remaining bound to the peptide(s) after endo H cleavage (Kobata, 1979) . After reduction, oligosaccharide alditols were fractionated by anionexchange HPLC. The results revealed that the majority of human VE-cadherin glycans carry negative charges. Complex type species, released by PNGase F, comprised neutral glycans (F0, 7% of radioactivity) in addition to species with one (F1, 49%), two (F2, 38%), or three (F3, 5%) negatively charged residues ( Figure 3A ). Oligosaccharides released by endo H, representing oligomannosidic or hybrid-type glycans (Kobata, 1979) , similarly carried predominantly (75%) one negative charge (data not shown). Treatment with sialidase from V.cholerae or mild acid hydrolysis converted all charged species into neutral compounds demonstrating that the negative charge was exclusively conferred by sialic acid. In the case of PNGase F-sensitive oligosaccharide alditols, charged glycans were separated by preparative anion-exchange HPLC and individually digested with \u03b12,3-specific sialidase from Newcastle disease virus. Monosialylated species could not be degraded and, thus, solely contained \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid, whereas di-and trisialylated glycans both contained one (or two) \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid residue(s) in addition to \u03b12,3-bound sialic acid ( Figure 3B -D). For further characterization, all glycans were completely desialylated.",

This was corroborated by high-pH anion- exchange chromatography (HPAEC) of the desialylated glycans ( Figure 4A ). Only species H3 (14% of radioactivity within this fraction) coeluted with an oligomannosidic standard oligosaccharide (OM9), whereas the elution volumes of the two major components, H1 and H2 (62% and 24%), did not correspond to those of oligomannosidic standards, but to two hybrid-type standard glycans, M III and M IV (Geyer et al., 1984) , respectively (for detailed structures, see Figure 4 caption). To further prove their identity, half the amount of endo H-sensitive compounds obtained was digested with \u03b1-mannosidase from jack beans. Rechromatography of the resulting products by HPAEC demonstrated that two products were formed eluting at the positions of authentic ManGlcNAcOH and GalGlcNAcMan 2 GlcNAcOH ( Figure 4B ). Digestion of the second half of the sample with \u03b2-galactosidase ( Figure 4C ) resulted in a shift of the elution volumes of the two hybrid-type species corresponding to the loss of one galactosyl residue each whereas the elution position of the oligomannosidic glycan H3 remained unchanged. Therefore, it may be assumed that the two major oligosaccharide alditols, H1 and H2, represent hybrid-type species with one N-acetyllactosamine antenna and two or three \u03b1-linked mannosyl residues. From their sensitivity towards endo H, it may be further concluded that the terminal mannosyl residue present in H1 glycans is \u03b11,3-linked (Kobata, 1979) . The minor component H3, on the other hand, represented an oligomannosidic glycan with nine Man residues.",

Although determination of chromatographic parameters does not allow a structural assignment a priori, comparison with the elution volumes of a set of appropriate oligosaccharide standards in at least two different chromatographic systems gives reliable results (Liedtke et al., 1997) . The glucose units obtained from internal calibration with isomaltooligosaccharides were compared with those of authentic fucosylated di-, two isomers of tri-, tetra-, and bisected dianten- nary standard oligosaccharide alditols. The majority of glycans thus identified (Figure 5A-D; fractions F01, F11, F13, F21, F31, F32) represented fucosylated species with two, three, or four N-acetyllactosamine antennae in addition to a few species not coeluting with any of these standard glycans (fractions F02, F12). This assumption was supported by gel filtration data which suggested the presence of incomplete triantennary species lacking one (or two) galactosyl residue(s). To further substantiate these assignments, the four fractions of complex type glycans as well as the respective oligosaccharide standards were treated with \u03b2-galactosidase from D.pneumoniae. Resulting products were again analyzed by HPAEC and, in part, also by gel filtration. As shown in Figure 5E -H, compounds identified as fucosylated di-, tri-, and tetraantennary species coeluted with the respective agalacto oligosaccharide standards after \u03b2-galactosidase treatment. Species F02 and F12, formerly eluting at 4.62 and 4.44 glucose units ( Figure 5A ,B), now coeluted with triantennary agalacto oligosaccharide standards ( Figure 5E ,F) and thus may be assumed to comprise fucosylated triantennary species with one (or two) incomplete antenna(e). Differentiation between the possible isomeric forms, however, was not possible. The elution position of species with 2.9 glucose units ( Figure 5A ) did not change after digestion with \u03b2-galactosidase, indicating the presence of incomplete species without any galactosyl residue. Because of their elution properties, it may be further concluded that they were also lacking, to a certain extent, outer GlcNAc residues. Since these glycans represented only minor constitu- Numbers (IM3-6) with arrows indicate the elution volumes of isomaltooligosaccharides with 3-6 glucose units; 2, 2b, 3, 3\u2032, 4, elution volumes of fucosylated diantennary, bisected diantennary, 2,4-branched (3) and 2,6-branched (3\u2032) isomers of triantennary and tetraantennary oligosaccharide standard alditols; 2g, 3g, 4g, elution volumes of the respective agalacto oligosaccharide standards (after degalactosylation, the two triantennary isomers and the bisected diantennary species coelute at 3g). ents, they were not further analyzed.

This netlike structure has not been described before and represents a highly ordered VE-cadherin organization only observable in confluent endothelial cell cultures.

After recalcification (1.8 mM of extracellular Ca 2+ ), VE-cadherin and MAA/SNA staining completely reappeared at the junctions within 30 min ( Figure 7D ,D1,E,E1).

They further indicate that sialic acids located at the interendothelial junctions are predominantly bound to Ca 2+ -dependent molecules, presumably VE-cadherin.

Under these conditions, VE-cadherin changed its continuous junctional distribution to a largely scattered morphology but was still localized at interendothelial junctions. Importantly, the VE-cadherin superstructure largely disappeared showing small protein clusters of various sizes indicating a loss of lateral adhesion between VE-cadherin molecules ( Figure 7A,A1) .

Since the separation systems used relied on different physicochemical parameters, comparison of the chromatographic data with those of oligosaccharide standards with known structures allowed a first structural assignment. Although anomeric configurations and linkage positions of the respective monosaccharide units were only unraveled in the case of sialic acid, galactosyl-and, in part, mannosyl residues, structures could be postulated on the basis of the general rules of mammalian glycoprotein-N-glycan architecture (Vliegenthart and Montreuil, 1995; Sharon and Lis, 1997) . The results revealed that human VE-cadherin is substituted predominantly (\u223c40% of total glycans) by sialylated diantennary complex-type glycans in addition to about 28% of sialylated hybrid-type species. Higher branched N-glycans, i.e., triantennary and, especially, tetraantennary chains as well as high mannose-type oligosaccharides were less abundant. Our data provided no evidence for the presence of oligosaccharides carrying \"bisecting\" GlcNAc as it has been shown by Nguyen and coworkers for bovine capillary endothelial cell carbohydrates (Nguyen et al., 1992) . Since the assignment of glycan structures is solely based on their chromatographic properties, however, the presence of small amounts of (eventually incomplete) bisected oligosaccharides cannot be completely ruled out. In conclusion, natural human VE-cadherin appears to be mainly decorated with carbohydrates of restricted branching pattern.",

            "text": "The high degree of sialylated oligosaccharide structures prompted us to visualize sialic acid residues at the surface of endothelial cells by lectin staining with MAA and SNA. Besides labeling of cell surface proteins, interendothelial junctions were strongly stained by these lectins which are specific for \u03b12,3and \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids. The junctional appearance of MAA/SNAlabeling was largely restricted to VE-cadherin (observed by double labeling) whereas PECAM-1 appeared more extendent at the junctions both in vivo and in culture. In addition, although endothelial cells are thin reaching seldom more than 3 \u00b5m in height, the use of confocal laser microscopy allows a rough localization with a resolution of \u223c0.5 \u00b5m. By this technique, VE-cadherin immunofluorescence as well as MAA/SNA-labeling appeared predominantly at the apical pole of the junctions whereas PECAM-1 was primarily located at the basal pole. This is in line with previously published data obtained by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrating a basal localization of PECAM-1 and an apical localization of VE-cadherin within the interendothelial junctions (Ayalon et al., 1994) . Furthermore, Ca 2+ -depletion experiments showed that the junctional presence of sialic acids as well as the presence of VE-cadherin was reversibly dependent on extracellular Ca 2+ -concentration whereas the junctional localization of PECAM-1 remained completely unchanged under all conditions. Additionally, it has been shown that VE-cadherin but not N-cadherin is clustered at the intercellular junctions (Salomon et al., 1992; Navarro et al., 1998) . Hence, it may be assumed that junction located sialic acids might be primarily bound to VE-cadherin, which is in agreement with the carbohydrate analyses of purified VE-cadherin. The remaining weak MAA/ SNA staining after Ca 2+ -depletion might be related to Ca 2+ -independent molecules such as PECAM-1.",

At overlapping endothelial cell junctions, a netlike VE-cadherin organization was visualized. This network can be considered as extended VE-cadherin clusters and is assumed to considerably increase the interendothelial adhesion properties. It has been shown by crystal structural analysis that cadherins are obviously organized as \"parallel strand dimers\" that interact with \"parallel strand dimers\" of opposite cells (adhesion dimers) forming a zipper-like structure (Shapiro et al., 1995a,b) . The formation of such a superstructure possibly requires lateral association of the assumed cadherin strand dimers that might be influenced by carbohydrate residues. The discussion on the contribution of glycan chains to VE-cadherin function, however, is still contradictory. Yoshimura and co-workers (Yoshimura et al., 1995 (Yoshimura et al., , 1996 provided evidence for a functional role of E-cadherin glycosylation in that murine melanoma B16-hm cells transfected with the (\u03b21-4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III) cDNA showed a higher expression of E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts than control cells. Since the presence of bisecting GlcNAc residues is known to block further branching of glycoprotein-N-glycans (Schachter, 1986 (Schachter, , 1995 Fujii et al., 1990) , respective glycans can be assumed to remain predominantly in the diantennary state. Therefore, the authors conclude that the reduced branching pattern of E-cadherin glycans, induced by ectopically expressed GnT-III, might be responsible for an elevated expression at the cell-cell border. This observation is in good agreement with our results revealing mainly diantennary and hybrid-type glycans on natural VE-cadherin. On the other hand, it has been observed that E-cadherin containing F9 cells still aggregate after tunicamycin treatment suggesting a glycan independent E-cadherin adhesive function (Shirayoshi et al., 1986) . Our data show that sialidase treatment of living endothelial cells caused a significant change in VE-cadherin cellular organization. Under these conditions, VE-cadherin still appeared at interendothelial junctions but displayed a scattered immunofluorescence pattern including the disappearance of its superstructure. In contrast, PECAM-1 underwent no morphological changes. Thus, the results described may at least suggest an involvement of sialic acid residues in the structural organization of VE-cadherin. The question, as to whether this finding depends, in fact, on sialic acid residues linked to VE-cadherin glycans, remains open since we cannot exclude that removal of sialic acids from the cell surface may cause indirect effects on VE-cadherin organization, as well.",

From the above results, one might speculate that VE-cadherin glycan chains represent the backbone for the presentation of sialic acids which might be involved in Ca 2+ -binding and, thus, in the maintenance of the rod-like VE-cadherin structure and its superstructural organization. Further studies are required, however, to definitely prove the influence of carbohydrate substituents on VE-cadherin function.",

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-(FITC), tetramethyl isothiocyanate-(TRITC), and cyanine 3-(Cy3) labeled secondary antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg). For lectin, antibody, and phalloidin labeling, fresh human umbilical cord vessels were canulated and perfused with Medium 199 to remove blood components and subsequently fixed with 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS containing 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.5 mM KH 2 PO 4 ; pH 7.4).

Samples were then washed with PBS and incubated for 60 min with FITC-or Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or TRITC-labeled sheep anti digoxigenin Fab fragments. For double-labeling of lectins (MAA and SNA) and specific antibodies directed to VE-cadherin as well as PECAM-1, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and incubated contemporary with MAA/SNA and the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as described above. After several washes with PBS (15 min), the coverslips were mounted on glass slides covered with 60% glycerol and 1.5% n-propylgallate as an antifading substance.
