            "text": "Public health is politically paradoxical because its core conceptual componentsthe exercise of public authority and the promotion of population health -stand in practical tension that belies their theoretical promise. Across Western nations, public policymakers stand accused of failing properly to honor and support the crucial contributions that public health makes to the improvement of health outcomes and of overinvesting in acute medical care services, the need for which timely interventions in prevention and health promotion might have averted. The dramatic budgetary discrepancies in Western nations between the massive funds devoted to medical care and the minuscule sums allotted to public health are often taken as evidence that in such matters, political leaders are irrational (or perhaps uninformed, or captured by big-moneyed medical interests) and that good public policy would have epidemiologists and other public health experts running, or at least orchestrating, the show. This paper explores the sources of this tension between population health and political power within the concept of public health and seeks to show why these strains prove to be so durable, indeed irresolvable. The argument and evidence draw largely on the United States, but the supposition -anyway, the hope -is that the analysis will also throw light on the politics of public health in other nations.",

            "text": "Rainer Maria Rilke 1 In 1966, Herbert Kaufman, a political scientist then at Yale University, surveyed the literature on the politics of public health and bewailed the barren scene. The public health profession tended to view itself as an evidence-based calling that stood above and beyond politics, while political scientists were slow to see how public health agencies and programs illuminated central disciplinary preoccupations such as budget making, recruitment of personnel, and the infl uence of constituencies on the performance of public agencies. Not a single public health text that Kaufman reviewed \"included anything more than a passing reference to politics, and most\u2026 did not contain even that.\" Conversely, the political science texts he surveyed contained \"virtually no references to the politics of public programs.\" 2 More than 40 years later, both public health and political analysis have expanded their practical and theoretical reach, but their trajectories are mainly parallel, rarely convergent. The public health community seldom acknowledges that its work is pervasively political, much less explores in depth how that political saturation shapes its professional life. Public health is supposedly driven by science, whereas politics turns on tainted tasks such as raising campaign funds from special interests, pandering to voters, catering to constituents, and indulging ideologies. On the other side, even on the increasingly rare occasions when political scientists step away from formal modelling and inspect concrete public policies, public health programs rarely win their attention. A careful review of the literature on the politics of public health policy by Tom Oliver in 2006 found a sizable body of studies on health policy (which had of course expanded its scope enormously in the United States and elsewhere since Kaufman wrote in 1966), but rather limited offerings in the fi eld of the politics of public health per se. 3 Much of course depends on defi nitions. \"Health\" nowadays is everyone's affair, from individuals styling their lives to corporations abating their pollutants, so the weight of explication must fall on \"public.\" One can defi ne \"public health\" as the sum of interventions undertaken by the public sector in health affairs, but a formulation that indicates no conceptual distinction between, say, how public programs such as Medicare pay for healthcare and how local public health agencies mobilize to combat bioterrorism or the spread of swine fl u is too indiscriminate to sustain insights into the politics of policy subfi elds. This paper, therefore, with an eye more on utility than precision, takes \"public health\" to mean the arts and science which advisors to and agents of the State employ in exercising their (public) authority to identify and address threats that derive from sources in the environment for the health of populations (For CEA Winslow' famous defi nition. 4(p.39) Though crude, this formulat ion divides the fi eld of inquiry into traversable units. Health coverage policies (national health insurance or national health services) give people access to care. Policies that support research on, or the practice of, acute care medicine develop the capacity of medical innovators and physicians to cure ailments grounded in physiological and/ or biochemical processes. Public health policies aim to keep groups of people (\"populations,\" and of course individuals within them) from getting sick. To study public health politically is to inquire how public institutions and actors (executives, legislatures, courts, bureaucracies, sub-national govern ments) and stakeholders in the private and voluntary sectors (interest groups, the media) shape the formulation and implementation of policies and programs the public health fi eld proposes and pursues.",

That these tools ought to be broadened and put in service of genuine planning that would replace institutional fragmentation with the comprehensive, coherent, coordinated arrangements communities deserve has long been a central tenet among public health afi cionados. Needless to say, these arguments have never found much of an audience beyond the public health community itself, and even the relatively powerless local Health Systems Agencies the US federal government sponsored between 1974 and 1986 tended to treat public health agencies as one constituent among many others. Some nations, and some US cities, however, now require that Health Impact Assessments be crafted and presented to policymakers who thereby presumably gain an accurate understanding of the implications of existing arrangements and of proposed public and private decisions for the health of the public. 7 By envisioning and estimating in advance as many potential threats to health as is feasible, such prognostic exercises are essentially prospective syntheses of the familiar protective, preventive, and promotional functions of public health. Benefi ciaries are, in principle, the community as a whole, and by its nature the strategy may implicate a virtually limitless range of public and private stakeholders. 7 Provision: In the US, public health institutions -especially city, county, and state health centers, clinics, and hospitals -deliver medical services to disadvantaged citizens (particularly the uninsured and some of those covered by Medicaid) and non-citizens, including illegal aliens. This public \"safety net\" cares for a distinct subset of the community and in doing so, negotiates incessantly with the purchasers, payers, and philanthropists about the resources from Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Dispro portionate Share funds, state appropriations, local tax levies, commercial payments, and foundation grants that allow them to stay in operation. This activity has been a chronic sore point for a contingent of public health leaders who have hoped that the federal government would one day create equitable and universal healthcare coverage and thus, by no longer \"draining vital resources away from population-wide services,\" 4(p. 13) let them get on with their proper roles and missions. Until 2010, the profession's pleas for universal coverage fared little better than those demanding health planning and the rationalization of community healthcare systems; indeed, the safety net duties of public health personnel appeared to be growing.",

The measure authorizes the expansion of Medicaid and the creation of income-related subsidies for most of the presently uninsured, aiming to increase coverage to roughly 95 percent nationally. However, it does not address the needs of illegal immigrants, who will presumably continue to get care from the safety net, as will (presumably) insured Americans who cannot readily fi nd \"mainstream\" providers to treat them. In short, provision is likely to remain a not insubstantial function of public health authorities for the indefi nite future. How these duties are acquitted in the future will depend, then as now, on a set of little-studied political variables that include: the legal status and strength of state and local public health agencies; the power of local medical societies (which may resist public health encroachments on any and all patients but the unprofi table and unappealing -e.g., substance abusers and those with sexually transmitted disease); and the entrepreneurial energies of local public health leaders.",

The public components of local safety nets are big business: city and county politicians control sizable shares of their budgets, residents benefi t from the jobs these institutions sustain, suppliers of their goods and services make money. Not a few public professionals, however, view safety nets dominated by large municipal hospitals as an anachronism and urge that such facilities, and the money they now consume, be used to create accessible primary care centers, leaving inpatient activities to increasingly under-occupied voluntary hospitals. Outcomes of these intra-professional fi ghts span a continuum from hardwon successes to bitterly-fought fi ascos, and rarely fail to consume sizable time, attention, and political capital. 8, 9 WHY PUBLIC HEALTH POLITICS IS PROBLEMATIC Even cursory contemplation of these fi ve functions of public health reveals a formidable policy presence that renders highly salient benefi ts to populations both general and special and likewise impinges prominently on the agendas of a wide range of public and private stakeholders. If the objective of health policy is to improve the health of populations (a not unreasonable proposition), public health can legitimately claim a record of accomplishment equal to or perhaps greater than that of acute care medicine, 10 which \"played almost no part in better health in 1900 and only a small part through 1950.\" 11 The contributions of medicine have grown tremendously since the mid-20 th century, but all the same, \"improvements in the physiology of one generation have been shown to result in improvements in the next or even a third generation,\" which implies that \"our grandchildren will continue to reap the benefi ts of the public health investments\" made in the early and middle 1900s, 12 all of which leaves ample and ambiguous scope for credit claiming by both the public health and medical services sectors.",

Indeed this community often views politics \"as a contaminant of an ideally rational decision-making process,\" not as an \"essential element of democratic governance.\" 4(p.5) The implementation of public health prescription into political practice in America has been problematic for centuries. When smallpox struck the Massachusetts colony in the early 18 th century, Boston's selectmen forbade the inoculations endorsed by Cotton Mather who was rewarded with a grenade thrown through a window of his house bearing the inscription, \"Cotton Mather, You Dog, Dam you; I'll inoculate you with this, with a Pox for you.\" In the last years of that century, yellow fever epidemics fueled a political fracas between Republicans, who believed the disease had local origins, and Federalists, convinced that it was imported by foreign enemies.",

As tuberculosis spread, \"no public regulatory agency took charge,\" even to enforce sanitary measures then on the books, and the struggle against the disease was ceded to sanitarians and sanatoria. 13 In these examples, as in contemporary cases, the public health enterprise faces several political challenges, none of them new, and none receding in importance. First, although the arguments for population-based policy interventions are obvious to public health professionals, they are often a hard sell to generalist policymakers for a myriad reasons. Formidable barriers, as Daniel Fox explains, include: the relatively low priority most voters assign to improvements in population health; the diffusion of responsibilities for effecting such improvements; the absence of evidence on matters of consequence to policymakers; the frustrations policymakers encounter in groping their way through such evidence as does exist; the resistance that measures to improve population health may trigger among medical professionals, manufacturers of medical technology, and segments of the public health community itself; and the special political infl uence that those who suffer serious chronic disease, and their families, often wield. 14, 15 As Constance Nathanson's review of interventions to curb smoking and reduce transmission of HIV by intravenous drug users in the United States, Great Britain, and France, demonstrates, even knowledge bases that seem self-evidently to justify public health policies must navigate various political \"contingencies\". 16 Second, the psychology of loss aversion and the political dynamics that attend intense preferences encourage policies that help sick people recover and subordinate those that keep them from getting sick in the fi rst place. Christ won fame for raising Lazarus from the dead, but had he merely prolonged his longevity no one (save perhaps Lazarus) would have known or cared. Virtually everywhere in the West, the centerpieces of healthcare policy are coverage that enables citizens to enter the acute care system when they need to do so and the quest for research breakthroughs (emanating in new technologies, that is, drugs, devices, and medical procedures) that mitigate or cure disease.",

            "text": "Third, public health interventions often stir controversies about the legitimate role of the state vis-\u00e0-vis individual autonomy and liberty and about the scope of personal versus social responsibility. John Stuart Mill's insistence that the State may abridge individual liberty only when harm to others is at issue, but not to constrain the choices of individuals \"for their own good\" resonates fi rmly in Western settings. 3 These concerns are especially salient in the US, which makes small government per se a point of national pride, but also extend well beyond the 50 states. Constraints on and disincentives for smoking, fi nes for failure to use seat belts while driving, and distribution of condoms to prevent unwanted pregnancies and the transmission of sexual diseases, for example, have all faced libertarian and/or moralistic objections. Today's preoccupation with the \"obesity epidemic\" likewise raises questions about how far governments should go toward infl uencing how much citizens weigh, what they eat, and how often they exercise. 17 -19 Sometimes grievances fl are quickly and then linger: for instance, in the past decade a social movement of parents who blame the autism of their children on vaccinations \"has blindsided public health offi cials\u2026and united the secular left and the religious right around distrust of government\u2026\" 20 Fourth, following statistical trails routinely leads public health practitioners into surprising (and surprised) institutional and organizational environments and the political turfs they occupy, as Fassin's instructive study of public health interventions in France to combat lead paint poisoning in children illustrates. 21 These int erventions followed a meandering path from physicians bewildered by symptoms of developmental retardation; to suspicions -and mounting evidence -that lead paint, peeling from walls in dilapidated apartments occupied by poor residents lay behind the symptoms; to pressures applied to city health and housing offi cials by an expanding coalition of public health physicians, toxicologists, social workers, offi cials in maternal and child protection agencies, leaders of humanitarian organizations, and experts on foreign approaches to the problem; and fi nally to French legislation in 1998. In quite a different policy arena, advocates for active living, who seek to change the \"built environment\" in communities in ways that encourage biking, walking, and other physical exertions in the course of daily life, fi nd themselves grappling with zoning codes, master plans, housing departments, park and recreation offi cials, real estate developers, mayors, city councils, transportation agencies, and other public and private stakeholders who occupy political niches little related to the accustomed preserves of public health and, for that matter, the mainstream healthcare system.",

Since then, public health professionals have found it easier to argue that cessation of smoking, moderate consumption of alcohol, safe sexual practices, regular exercise, and consumption of more fresh fruits and vegetables and fewer junk foods can help to forestall illness, including such dreaded ailments as cancer, stroke, and heart disease is at least as important as the curative approach of the biomedical model traditionally thought to hold the key. \"Healthy\" has become a familiar modifi er for all manner of entities, activities, and conditions -for instance, cities, eating, aging, and living.

At what age it becomes cost effective to cover mammograms and pap smears for women, for example, and at what intervals these procedures should be recommended, are vexing issues contested not only in learned journals but also on page one of the daily press. Cheap, effective vaccinations are one thing; screening tests applied to millions of people, most of whom are unlikely to contract the illness in question, are another. 28, 29 Analytical and empirical sorting out of the benefi ts, costs, and savings of public health interventions are becoming ever more fragmented and context-dependent -a sign of scientifi c maturation and sophistication, no doubt, but also a source of uncertainty for policymakers in search of solutions that are (in Ronald Reagan's famous formulation) if not easy, at least simple.",

Not long ago government mandates, now nearubiquitous in the West, that drivers of automobiles use seat belts, could be derided by those determined to live free and die as a grievous assault on individual liberty. 17 Restrictions (and taxes) on smoking have advanced steadily in many nations, albeit by diverse routes and at different paces. In the US, for example, antismoking organizations led the charge for legislation and court decisions that curbed the \"rights\" of smokers and tobacco companies; in Great Britain such measures awaited the support of the medical elite. 16 In the US, the fl amboyant moral fervor that produced Prohibition continues to shine a judgmental spotlight both inward (on the \"personal responsibility\" of individuals to adopt healthy lifestyles) and outward (on the profi t-maximizing depredations of corporations that, but for aggressive regulation, would blithely spread toxins throughout the nation's air, water, and workplaces). 32 Demonization of tobacco fi rms worked well in the fi ght for laws and regulations against smoking, and that strategy is being reprised by some anti-obesity activists in the assault on manufacturers of junk foods. 33 The growth of political support for government regulations that constrain the rights of individuals and corporate bodies in order to protect the health of the public does not invariably enlarge and preserve the power of public health agencies, however. Visions of \"holistic\" leadership by public health professionals routinely succumb to the bureaucratic fragmentation endemic in US healthcare policy. In the US, for example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the commodities (now including tobacco) denoted by its title, the Federal Trade Commission oversees the advertising of consumer products, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration has charge of workplace safety, and the Environmental Protection Agency not only enforces requirements under the landmark \"public health\" laws that aim to reduce pollution in the nation's air and water but also regulates insecticides, fungicides, and rodenticides (and shares authority with the FDA over substances used in food processing plants). Kaufman also remarked on this fragmentation. 2 Nor is political support for regulation inexhaustible. Policymakers in Great Britain and the US, for instance, wary of intruding too coercively into the citizenry's weight, eating habits, and exercise patterns, have begun to contemplate and experiment with \"libertarian paternalist\" strategies of health promotion such as personal fi nancial incentives, that is, payments to individuals who lose weight and take up exercise. 34, 35 But perhaps policy must go beyond \"mere\" incentives to subsidies: calculating the costs of government recommendations that Americans greatly increase their consumption of green leafy and deep-yellow vegetables, J. Oliver concludes that, barring a huge decrease in their price, \"We would need to pay people to eat them.\" 18",

Leaders in the fi ve cities it funded -Detroit, Oakland, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Baltimore -soon concluded that the most salient threats in question were violence, drugs, teen pregnancies, and other problems with which one coped by (for example) helping kids to stay in school instead of dropping out and offering appealing activities in the largely unsupervised after-school hours of 3-7 pm. These objectives had little to do with health institutions or public health, and much to do with school systems and the opaque set of voluntary institutions that constitute the after-school sector. The broader the social determinants of health with which public health professionals seek to engage (e.g., income distribution, housing conditions, employment markets, work conditions, stress, status) the more must they learn to map and navigate across complex and unfamiliar institutional terrain.",

Provision (in the US) gains prominence as the number of uninsured and medically disadvantaged grows, but disturbs those who rue it as a distraction from the proper missions of the fi eld.

The dominant fact of life of contemporary public (including healthcare) policy is growth of government, which seeks to shape and steer healthcare systems that, in the United States and elsewhere, grow steadily larger and more problematic. This pattern is decades old, but its manifestations are, in the nature of the case, new: endless policy innovations launch new political adventures, devoid of certainty and riddled with contingency. 19 On the surface, this growth of healthcare policy is not good news for public health, as much of it in the United States and elsewhere centers on the eternally ambivalent building up and reining in of acute care systems and their myriad, multiplying specialized factors and sectors of production. Not far below the surface, however, lies better news: within the interstices of healthcare policies are targets and windows of opportunity in which the fi eld may fi nd settled policy turf. Advocates of health promotion work to win statutory and fi nancial support for bike lanes in federal transportation laws; demonstrations aiming to prevent falls by, and counter social isolation of, the aged may be embodied in Medicare; state insurance laws may be made to mandate coverage for screening procedures; needle exchanges among drug users may gain legitimacy in the struggle to prevent transmission of HIV.",

Such allies and champions are made -socially and politically constructed -not born of evidence, epidemiological or other, which may help to generate political demand for what the profession seeks to supply but is seldom if ever suffi cient to change policy by itself.

Those who hope to shape the multiple social, cultural, and physical environments that determine the health of populations need more than glancing acquaintance with policy venues that have, superfi cially, little to do with health per se. Beyond that, they should be conversant with, and prepared to draw on, historical and social scientifi c insights that illuminate these environments and help to \"translate\" their institutional properties into terms that can speak persuasively to policymakers. And public health leaders should gain skill in appraising these bodies of knowledge, which enrich the policy content and claims of public health specialists, in the contexts of the political obstacles and opportunities that confront them and the strategies available for coping with the former and capitalizing on the latter.",
