A labelling efficiency close to 100% indicates that injected and uninjected cells enter S-phase with equal efficiency after injection of control antibody. NIH 3T3 cells were transformed with membrane-associated, receptor-like proteins (src, fms and fes 2 ,17-20) by transfection of cloned viral DNA. Approximately 12-15 h after microinjection of antibody 259, a distinct morphological reversion from the transformed phenotype was observed in cells that had been transformed by each of the three viral oncogenes. Transformed cells that had a rounded or spindle-shaped morphology with a refractile appearance reverted to the flattened shape of untransformed NIH 3T3 cells. Figure 1 shows such reversion after injection into src-transformed cells. Morphological reversion continued until 30-50 h after injection (at which time injected antibody had disappeared from the cells); then the cells became morphologically transformed once again (data not shown) 13 . In addition to its morphological effects, antibody 259 decreased dramatically the thymidine incorporation of transformed cells labelled during a 3-h pulse between 15 and 24 h after antibody injection. In Fig. 2a -d the decrease in thymidine incorporation following injection of antibody into Jms-and Jes-transformed cells is clearly visible. Several different clones transformed by each oncogene were analysed. In each of the three trans form ants labelling efficiencies varied from 10 to 30% (Table la) . For comparison, ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and untransformed NIH 3T3 cells had labelling efficiencies of 10-15% (Table O.

The transforming genes of these viruses are not closely related to the sequences of cellular genes or retroviral oncogenes but they may function similarly. These viruses commonly possess multiple transforming genes l . Transformation by these viruses displays differences in dependence on c-ras, just as observed with retroviral oncogenes. NIH 3T3 cells transformed by one such virus, bovine papillomavirus (BPV; from D. R. Lowl 5 ), were tested as described above, together with WI38 and BALB 3T3 cells transformed by simian virus 40 (SV40). Antibody 259 clearly induced morphological reversion in BPV-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2e,f) and reduced thymidine incorporation. While the antibody clearly inhibited entry into S-phase in cells transformed by BPV, the labelling efficiencies were normally between 26 and 45% (Table 1 b) . It is unknown whether the difference in labelling efficiencies between cells transformed by this virus and those transformed by the membrane-associated oncogenes is significant. In cells transformed by SV40, on the other hand, the anti-ras antibody inhibited proliferation little if at all. While both cell types tested are efficiently inhibited by the antibody prior to transformation!6, labelling efficiencies after SV40 transformation were 86 and 93 %, similar to those observed with the mos and raj oncogenes.

The cell lines listed above were also injected with non-neutralizing antibody 238. For antibody 238 injections, average labelling efficiencies were in the range 95-105% (see text). NIH 3T3 cells transformed with the sis oncogene 20 showed a labelling efficiency of 17 \u00b1 2%. In transfected cells not characterized previously, a cloned cell population was analysed by Southern blotting to ensure that the viral oncogene had become incorporated into cellular DNA. Growth in soft agar and morphological examination verified that the transfected cells displayed the phenotypic characteristics of transformed cells. Labelling efficiencies were obtained by first determining the percentage of injected cells which had incorporated thymidine, then dividing this percentage by the percentage of uninjected cells on the same plate which were labelled. * These cells were transformed by transfection 29 of the viral oncogene described in the reference cited. Clones of transformed NIH 3T3 cells obtained in soft agar were tested by Southern analysis to ensure that the transfected oncogene had been incorporated into the cellular genome.

As described above, this antibody neutralizes ras protein within the injected NIH 3T3 cell!3. However, it is possible that another cellular protein is also neutralized by the antibody. To ascertain that it is in fact c-ras proteins which are neutralized and responsible for the results described, we tested numerous tumour cell lines. In these tumour lines the phenotype of antibody inhibition strongly correlates with the presence of a mutant ras oncogene l6 . Furthermore, deletion mutants of the ras gene which are biologi-NA~TU~R~E~V~O~L~.3~2~0~10~A~P~R~IL~19~86~ _________________ LETTERSTONATURE------------------------------------~54~3 cally active but which do not bind antibody 259 have been prepared recently; cells transformed by such mutants were not altered morphologically, nor did they show greatly inhibited thymidine incorporation, after injection of antibody 259 26 \u2022 It is assumed that while viral oncogenes function without normal control, their mechanism of action is similar to that of related cellular genes. Here we have presented evidence to support this idea in the case of growth factor receptor-like molecules and related oncogenes. It is therefore possible that these data might aid in understanding the way in which cellular genes interact in the control of normal proliferation. Our results indicate that some receptor-like oncogenes depend on ras proteins while some cytoplasmic oncogenes do not. There are, of course, numerous oncogenes which we have not yet tested which might behave differently from those described here. With this limitation in mind and on the basis of our present data, we propose that an important class of proliferative signals are received at the cell surface by receptor molecules such as growth factor receptors, and the c-ras proteins are essential in the transfer of these signals to cytoplasmic effectors having serine kinase activity; the effectors then modify target molecules which are directly involved in initiating a proliferative cycle. Accordingly, if the cytoplasmic effector were mutated such that it functioned without activation, proliferation would continue independently of c-ras proteins. Receptor molecules, on the other hand, would always require c-ras to stimulate proliferation.",

This observation is of immunological significance because such activated astrocytes can act as antigen-presenting cells, as demonstrated with myelin basic protein for antigen-specific encepbalitogenic T-cell lines 3 \u2022 However, the lack of lymphatic drainage in brain and the presence of the so-called blood-brain barrier restricting traffic of cells and macromolecules suggests that IFN-y may not be readily available, at least during the initial phases of viral infections. The question therefore arises as to whether astrocytes can be induced to express Ia antigens by other signals directly related to viral infection and possibly independent of IFN-y. In the present report we demonstrate that a neurotropic murine hepatitis virus induces expression of Ia antigen on astrocytes in tissue culture without infection, rendering these brain cells competent to participate directly in the immune response to a viral infection.The murine coronaviruses are a group of agents causing acute, subacute or chronic infections in mice or rats accompanied by different disease processes 4 , The JHM strain of this group is neurotropic and has been shown to induce acute or subacute encephalomyelitides which depend on virus as well as host factors 5 \u2022 One important factor in the case of subacute encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats is the immune response, which is directed not only against the virus but also against brain tissue 6 \u2022 As various types of central nervous system (CNS) disease are associated with this neurotropic murine coronavirus strain, we chose this virus to define its interaction with rat brain cells in culture with respect to the induction of Ia antigen on astrocytes,As a baseline for our study, we analysed the response of Lewis primary glial cell cultures consisting of macro phages carrying Fc receptors (Fc receptor+) and astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+) (Fig,2a-c) to recombinant rat IFN-y (10 U ml-1 ; Fig. la ). Recombinant rat IFN-y induced the expression of Ia on numerous cells in the primary cultures, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that 3-10% of the cells were induced to express Ia compared with the control after 18 h treatment with 10 U ml-1 IFN-y, reaching a maximum at",
