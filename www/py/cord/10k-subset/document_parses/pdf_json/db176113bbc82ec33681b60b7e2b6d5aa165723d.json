To evaluate their virucidal efficacy, these products must be tested with appropriate model viruses with different physico-chemical properties under conditions representing practical application in hospitals. The aim of this study was to evaluate a quantitative carrier assay. Furthermore, different putative model viruses like adenovirus type 5 (AdV-5) and different animal parvoviruses were evaluated with respect to their tenacity and practicability in laboratory handling. To evaluate the robustness of the method, some of the viruses were tested in parallel in different laboratories in a multicenter study. Different biocides, which are common active ingredients of surface disinfectants, were used in the test. After drying on stainless steel discs as the carrier, model viruses were exposed to different concentrations of three alcohols, peracetic acid (PAA) or glutaraldehyde (GDA), with a fixed exposure time of 5 minutes. Residual virus was determined after treatment by endpoint titration. All parvoviruses exhibited a similar stability with respect to GDA, while AdV-5 was more susceptible. For PAA, the porcine parvovirus was more sensitive than the other parvoviruses, and again, AdV-5 presented a higher susceptibility than the parvoviruses. All parvoviruses were resistant to alcohols, while AdV-5 was only stable when treated with 2-propanol. The analysis of the results of the multi-center study showed a high reproducibility of this test system. In conclusion, two viruses with different physico-chemical properties can be recommended as appropriate model viruses for the evaluation of the virucidal efficacy of surface disinfectants: AdV-5, which has a high clinical impact, and murine parvovirus (MVM) with the highest practicability among the parvoviruses tested.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Nosocomial virus infections can prove fatal to people who are particularly vulnerable to infections.

In Europe, EN 14476 describes the standard for determining virucidal activity, which involves two non-enveloped viruses and a quantitative suspension assay [11] . This quantitative suspension test is performed in a test tube. The shortcoming of this assay is that the virus particles are suspended in a large volume of disinfectant, which makes inactivation of viruses easier due to the high amount of contact between the disinfectant and virus particles.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 522, "end": 526, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Therefore, suspension tests do not reflect real conditions. In practice, viruses are immobilized on objects and/or work surfaces with a high protein load from body fluids, which may protect viruses from disinfection. To ensure that surface disinfectants are able to inactivate microorganisms, they must be tested for their efficacy under close to real-life conditions. This type of practical assay has long been standardized for the testing of the bactericidal activity of chemical disinfectants [12, 13, 14] . Bactericidal disinfectants are tested stepwise according to European test principles, beginning with a suspension test (EN phase 2, step 1) and then a quantitative non-porous carrier test simulating practical conditions (EN phase 2, step 2) [14, 15] . In contrast to the test for bactericidal activity, until now, no European standard for virucidal efficacy testing that simulates practical conditions exists. Such a test should be based on model viruses that can be dried on carriers. The choice of model viruses is of great importance when establishing such a carrier test. The requirements for model viruses are as follows: high resistance to disinfectants and drying, combined with simple virus propagation in cell culture. The model viruses that are already being used in the suspension test and that fulfill these requirements can be taken into account. In the suspension test, according to EN 14476 (phase 2/step 1), poliovirus type 1 LSc-2ab and adenovirus type 5 strain (AdV-5) Adenoid 75 are used as model viruses. Both viruses are suitable with respect to their resistance to active ingredients, but polioviruses have some drawbacks. In general, the use of poliovirus is only temporary, and in the future, such use will require higher biosafety levels because of the global polio eradication program, which was initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1988 [16] .

Disinfection research in virology is somewhat neglected, although prevalence studies and personnel monitoring have shown contamination hazards [25] . The useful dilutions and contact time of virucidal surface disinfectants are still based on concentrations that will pass either an European suspension test, that is, EN 14476, or a national standard, such as the German DVV/ RKI suspension test [11, 18] . In order to improve time/concentration relations of surface disinfectants which reflect dayly needs in clinical surroundings further more practical testing is necessary. Therefore, a virucidal quantitative carrier test that simulates practical conditions was evaluated in this study. The method was based on the EN 13697 standard for the following reasons [14, 20] : In 1993, experts from the veterinary, food, industrial, domestic and institutional fields within the framework of CEN/TC 216 developed such a quantitative surface test for bactericidal and fungicidal products that mimics real conditions [26] . Derived from this work is the European standard EN 13697 [14] , a quantitative non-porous surface test for the evaluation of the bactericidal and/ or fungicidal activity of chemical disinfectants without mechanical action (phase 2, step 2). Ring trials during the 1990s demonstrated that this surface test, when using dried bacteria or fungi on stainless steel carriers, could result in 10-fold lower reduction factors than those obtained using suspension tests [13] . This observations are also supported by studies of Peters and Spicher on Staphylococcus aureus which showed an increased resistance to formaldehyde, from 0.8% in the suspension test to 1.2% in the surface test [27, 28] . Based on this observatiuons, it is assumed that virucidal disinfectants might also show an increased resistance in the surface test. However, a virucidal surface test is required to substantiate this notion and for further knowledge. The next issue of this study was to find suitable candidates for the test viruses of a surface test.. In Europe, model viruses that cover a broad spectrum of physico-chemical properties have been used for testing and verifying the efficacy of disinfectants under practical conditions. Currently, poliovirus and AdV-5 are used by the European Standard EN 14476 as model viruses for quantitative suspension tests [11] . Poliovirus was excluded from this study because it is relatively sensitive to the drying process, with a loss of titer of approximately 3 log 10 [17] . In addition, due to the WHO polio eradication program, poliovirus will need to be substituted with another model virus with similar properties in the future. The thermoresistant virus BPV is used for the determination of the virucidal activity of chemothermal disinfection procedures in both the EN 14476 and the DVV/RKI guideline. However, BPV is difficult to grow in the laboratory. In contrast, PPV and MVM are easy to propagate. Therefore, this study investigated the suitability of AdV-5 and four different animal parvoviruses (BPV, CPV, MVM, and PPV) as putative model viruses that can potentially substitute for poliovirus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 593, "end": 597, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 598, "end": 601, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 960, "end": 964, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 965, "end": 968, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1212, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1276, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1681, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1898, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1899, "end": 1902, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2554, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2702, "end": 2706, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "One of the basic requirements for a model virus is stability during a drying process.

MNV demonstrated a similar stability during drying as AdV-5 and parvoviruses. The virucidal susceptibility of MNV is similar to those of PPV in our study [21] . Concentrations of 1500 ppm for PAA and 2500 ppm for GDA were needed to inactivate 99.99% of MNV within 5 min [21] . However, the activity range of alcohols was nearly the same as for AdV-5 in our study. Ethanol (50%, v/v) and 1-propanol (30%, v/v) could inactivate MNV-1 on stainless steel discs by 4 log 10 units within 5 min, and 2-propanol was not active. As already mentioned, one of the aims of our study was to evaluate the reproducibility of the method used. We could show, that there were no considerable intra-and inter-laboratory log 10 RF differences discerned for the PVs. The observed log 10 RF discrepancies were found at concentrations with low efficacy and might be caused by a number of factors (e.g., the manner of the preparation of the test virus suspension, limitations due to cytotoxic reactions, inactivation kinetics). Our study has some limitations that are based on the nature of virus cultivation. For example, if all labs used viruses and cells from the same origin at an identical passage number and equal culture media, as well as under other identical conditions, the results would perhaps differ to a lesser extent. On the other hand, the performance of our study includes the biological variety that appears during disinfectant testing. High standardization for virus cultivation and reproducible measures to minimize cytotoxicity are necessary for performing this method. Further standardization of this method might be achieved by the introduction of certain reference biocides with defined reference ranges, such as GDA, PAA, or ethanol. This and further ring trials will contribute to improving the comparability of virucidal tests between laboratories.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 708, "end": 712, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 713, "end": 716, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 717, "end": 720, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 721, "end": 724, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 725, "end": 728, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 804, "end": 807, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 826, "end": 830, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1064, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1180, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, our results present a feasible method that enables an efficacy assessment that simulates applications in hospital settings.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Based on our results MVM and AdV-5 can be recommended as appropriate model viruses for the evaluation of virucidal efficacy of surface disinfectants.
