We present our experience with H1N1-associated ARDS and successful bridging of lung function using superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) in combination with continuous positive airway pressure/assisted spontaneous breathing (CPAP/ASB). Methods: We admitted five patients with H1N1 infection and ARDS to our intensive care unit. Although all patients required pure oxygen and controlled ventilation, oxygenation was insufficient. We applied SHFJV/CPAP/ ASB to improve oxygenation. Results: Initial PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio prior SHFJV was 58-79 mmHg. In all patients, successful oxygenation was achieved by SHFJV (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio 105-306 mmHg within 24 h). Spontaneous breathing was set during first hours after admission. SHFJV could be stopped after 39, 40, 72, 100, or 240 h. Concomitant pulmonary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection was observed in all patients. Two patients were successfully discharged. The other three patients relapsed and died within 7 weeks mainly due to combined HSV infection and in two cases reoccurring H1N1 infection.

High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) and highfrequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) are characterized by rapid delivery of small tidal volumes (V t ) (1-3 ml/kg predicted body weight) at high frequencies (2.5-5 Hz). As such, P mean during jet ventilation is comparable to the pressure level of PEEP in conventional mechanical ventilation due to its minimal V t . Yet, P peak and P mean are markedly reduced with a reduction of tidal hyperinflation and tidal decruitment [8] . Furthermore, oxygen toxicity may be reduced as lower FiO 2 often are required compared with mandatory ventilation [8] . This beneficial effect could be demonstrated in animal models of HFOV.

There are two options in resolving this problem. The simplest approach is to establish spontaneous breathing.

In the case of severe hypercapnia, the use of Interventional Lung Assist (ILA) can improve CO 2 clearance. We observed a high mortality rate, which can be -explained, in part, by patient selection. All of our patients presented in this report were admitted with fixed hypoxemia despite optimized conventional ventilation. Two patients presented a prolonged period of hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation before admission. One of these patients was already on mechanical ventilation 14 days due to septic CMV-colitis and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia with poor prognosis. The other patient was admitted to our ICU after a prolonged period of severe hypoxemia and septic shock with hypoperfusion. All five patients had a HSV-PCR-positive BAL, confirmed via lung biopsy in one patient. Viral coinfection with HSV may cause and prolongs a status of persistent immunosuppression during severe H1N1 infection, which is associated with a high risk of death.
