All the three phenomena affect the food security and well being of nearly a billion people earning less than $1 a day. An overwhelming share of these people live in Africa and Asia, two continents that also bear a disproportionate share of the world's disease burden, particularly in terms of HIV-AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Among the poor are some 125 million stunted and underweight children and over 10 million orphans.",

Moreover, wide experimentation with GM technologies is currently taking place within the public research systems of developing countries. The challenge for developing countries thus seems to be how to manage the risks associated with biotechnology, not whether to deploy it, particularly since biotechnological benefits would be mostly domestic-to their own producers and consumers. Yet due to the popular opinion against these technologies and the regulatory requirements prompted by these concerns, in the European Union and East Asia, the costs of environmental and other risk assessment are large-and they are mounting. 1 \"Biotechnology\" has been defined by the Office of the Technology Assessment (OTA) of the U.S. Congress as \"any technique that uses living organisms or substances from those organisms, to make or modify a product to improve plants or animals, or to develop microorganisms for specific uses.\" It encompasses both \"traditional biotechnology,\" which includes well-established technologies used in commercially useful operations such as biological control of pests, conventional breeding of plants, animal vaccine production, and cell and tissue culture techniques, as well as \"modern biotechnology,\" which includes recently available tools for expediting selection and breeding ranging from the use of recombinant DNA, monoclonal antibodies, molecular markers, and transgenic techniques, to genetically engineered live organisms used to modify a variety of characteristics in host plants and animals such as productivity enhancement, growth cycles, and resistance to a variety of environmental or genetic stresses.",

The new tools are already being applied in a variety of human and animal healthrelated issues-for example, to develop vaccines for AIDS and malaria, immunization for other commonly encountered diseases, and to improve diagnostic tools for tropical diseases, among others. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and bilateral donors have provided several million dollars for such research (Govindaraj and Sarna). Biotechnology is helping the developing countries and the CGIAR centers in germplasm enhancement including gene identification and characterization, marker assisted selection, DNA sequencing and finger printing, transformation for herbicide and drought resistance, enhancement of nutritional quality, and control of animal diseases (Lele et al., p. 44) . Animal disease control in developing countries has far reaching global health implications. Foot and mouth disease alone causes losses estimated at $12 billion. An estimated 50% of organisms are naturally transmitted from livestock and wild species to humans. The recent rapid DNA sequencing of the SARS virus demonstrated the high return to the new biological tools. SARS caused damage of well over $30 billion to China and East Asian economies.",

Credible empirical evidence is emerging from the studies of the early trials and/or adoption of Bt cotton in China (Pray et al., , India (Quim and Zilberman, , Mexico (Traxler et al.) and Bt maize in South Africa (Ismael, Bennet, and Morse) that suggests more stable and/or higher yields in selected locales compared to conventional varieties under comparable circumstances. The new GM technology (in the form of seed and related inputs) is highly divisible and per unit of output farm production costs are reported to be low due to the reduced use of pesticides and labor. Using these studies Traxler estimated positive incremental profits per hectare in Bt cotton production relative to conventional varieties across countries although with substantial variation in the level of profits among countries. Less visible but important benefits reported by Pray et al. in China include improved human health and well being as a result of the reduced application of chemical inputs and less use of labor. They report well over 4 million farmers had planted GM cotton in the Yellow River Delta by 2001 with substantial increase in cotton production.",

Six developing countries had over 25% of the global share of 150 odd million acres of transgenic crops in 2002.

It suggests farmer share in total benefits as high as 88% and 86% from GM crops in developing countries like China and Mexico, respectively, compared to the farmer share of 45% in the U.S. cotton industry. Traxler argues that although the high cost of basic research on biotechnology is confined to a handful of multinational companies, the process of plant breeding using the particular genes is relatively low cost and can be afforded by most developing countries (Traxler) . Technology transfer takes place through licensing. Absence of enforcement of IPRs benefits farmers and maximizes the production of GM crops, Giannakas argues that zero enforcement is an optimal strategy for developing country governments wishing to maximize adoption and maintain competitiveness of their producers vis-\u00e0-vis producers in competing countries. Multinational private companies, nevertheless, are conducting most of the trials in developing countries. Excluding China during the 1991-99 period, as many as 630 trials were undertaken by multinational companies compared to 87 by the developing country private sector and 97 by the developing country public sector (Traxler) . But this proportion may be changing rapidly. The number of commercial seed companies in developing countries, virtually absent around the time of the green revolution in the 1970s is growing. Furthermore, many multinational corporations have acquired seed companies in developing countries.",

However, information on these public sector investments and the nature of their interaction with the private sector is still incomplete. Moreover, even large developing countries cannot match the resources of multinational companies.

This was notwithstanding active maize trade under NAFTA with the United States, a producer of transgenic corn. But the controversy surrounding the alleged discovery of transgenic DNA in traditional varieties of maize grown in the remote highlands of Oaxaca region in Mexico has already involved prestigious scientific establishments such as the University of California, Berkley scientists, the Nature magazine, multinational corporations involved in GM crops, and NGOs (Mann, 1617-18) . The controversy goes to show the high stakes, the high costs, as well as the fundamental importance of urgently putting in place credible, independent scientific assessments and broadly accepted procedures. The need for such international standards and procedures is particularly high, although costly in terms of time, resources, and expertise, from the perspective of developing countries because the claims also touched CGIAR's Centro International de Mejorameinto de Maiz y Trigo (CIMMYT) but turned out to be without foundation. These claims potentially jeopardize food security not simply of the poor in Mexico but of those other developing countries that rely on the CGIAR maize germplasm to increase maize productivity in their countries.",

The World Bank's safeguard policies now cover environmental assessment, natural habitats, pest management, indigenous people, forestry, dam safety, cultural property, involuntary resettlement, international waters, and disputed areas. The \"do no harm\" safeguards, among other reasons-result in risk avoidance behavior among World Bank staff and managers, leading to fewer World Bank investments in water, forests, marginal areas, pesticides, and research. Overall agricultural lending to developing countries has declined precipitously since the early 1990s and currently only $50 million of the Bank's agricultural loans go to biotechnology (Lele et al.) .",

In the case of cotton, the mainstay of several poor countries in West Africa, 25,000 large U.S. cotton producers received $3.6 billion of agricultural subsidies in 2001, with price declines in Benin alone leading 250,000 cotton-dependent people to fall below the poverty line (Watkins, . Tariffs imposed by industrial countries on processed agricultural commodities from developing countries are several times higher than tariffs on nonprocessed commodities. Thus the future import dependence of developing countries depends not only on how well they manage their domestic policies and natural resources and embrace technical change to remain internationally competitive but on the agricultural policies of OECD countries.",

The GM debate has also reduced incentives for food-deficit Zambia to import food aid supplied GM maize, because Zambia fears it could close access to the European markets when maize surpluses do emerge in Zambia. This is even though the FAO world food summit in 2002 endorsed the promotion of GM crops and WHO declared no evidence of health hazards from GM maize.",

The CGIAR's productivity enhancing germplasm enhancement research, which fueled the green revolution and lifted millions out of poverty and hunger, has declined at 6.5% annually during this same period due to unpopularity of even the conventional germ plasm improvement research in the constituencies of some OECD donor countries. The CGIAR spends only $25 million annually on biotechnology compared to well over $10 billion by the private sector. Its center by center approach to research is fragmented and lacks a critical minimum mass of scientists or equipment. It also lacks a system level policy, strategy, or capacity for biotechnology and IPRs or public-private partnerships. And CGIAR's environmental research is not sufficiently focused on its plant science research at a time when environmental consequences of biotechnology research are attracting worldwide attention.",

Currently there is a huge gap between the R&D capacity in developed and developing countries, with nearly 10 times as many scientists per capita in industrial countries as in developing countries. Global collective action is needed to take advantage of the communications and information technologies, exploit economies of scale in the organization of institutional solutions, reduce search and transaction costs for developing countries, harmonize standards of bio and food safety, bridge the scientific, human, and informational gap, and establish the confidence of the consumers and civil society through clearly defined international standards and norms.",
