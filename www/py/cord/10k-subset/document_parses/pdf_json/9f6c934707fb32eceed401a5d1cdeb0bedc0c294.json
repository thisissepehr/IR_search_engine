This study evaluated the associations between histological parameters and liver CSCs (LCSC) in HCC, and compared CSC in HCC associated with and without hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Methods: Seventy-nine tumors (49 surgical resections from 46 patients, and 30 from autopsy) were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for the LCSC marker EpCAM, liver progenitor cell (LPC) marker CK19 and NCAM were performed and were correlated with histological features of tumor behavior. Results: Thirty-three tumors (41.8 %) showed positive staining for EpCAM. CK19 and NCAM expression were seen in 26 (32.9 %) and 4 (5.1 %) tumors respectively. The expression of EpCAM and CK19 correlated significantly with each other (p<0.001). EpCAM expression was significantly associated with features indicating aggressive tumor behavior, including younger age of onset, higher serum AFP levels, tumor cell dedifferentiation, increased mitotic activity, and vascular invasiveness.

Factors which initiate and perpetuate UC are not well understood. It is still unclear if any relationship exists between cytokines, oxidative stress, gastrointestinal (GI) motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in UC patients. Therefore, the present study was planned to examine the relationship between these factors among UC patients. Methods: Total 120 UC patients and 125 age and sex matched controls with no GI symptoms were enrolled. Levels of plasma IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 were measured in all subjects by using ELISA. Lipid-peroxidation (LPO) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured by standard methods. Orocecal transit time (OCTT) and SIBO were measured by lactulose and glucose hydrogen breath tests respectively. Results: Out of 120 UC patients, 74 were males with mean \u00b1SD of age 45.6\u00b117.5 years. Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 in UC patients were significantly higher Indian J Gastroenterol (November 2013) 32(Suppl 1):A1-A132 Background: Data from India suggest that colorectal cancer (CRC) occurs in 0.94 % to 1.8 % of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We report our data on CRC in UC. Methods: Data on 430 patients (248 males [57.7 %]; mean age 44 [SD 14.6] years; median duration of disease 6 (Interquartile range 7) years with UC were available for analysis from the inflammatory bowel disease database maintained since 2005. Thirty-eight (8.8 %) patients had proctitis, 95 (22.1 %) proctosigmoiditis, 131 (30.5 %) left-sided colitis, 159 (37 %) pancolitis and extent was unknown in 7 patients. Patients with histologically confirmed CRC within the segment with colitis were compared with those without CRC, to determine risk factors for the development of CRC. Results: Twelve patients (2.8 %) developed CRC. The incidence density was 3.556/1000 patient-years of disease (PYD) overall-2.995/1000 in the first 10 years, 3.338/1000 PYD at 10 to 20 years, and 7.030 /1000 PYD at >20 years. On univariate analysis age, gender, duration of disease, extent of colitis, smoking, duration of 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy, family history of inflammatory bowel disease, medication compliance and disease control were considered for analysis. Extensive colitis (disease proximal to splenic flexure) (p = 0.01), longer duration of disease (p =0.00001) and poor control of disease (p=0.007) were associated with development of CRC. On multivariate analysis, duration of disease (p = 0.0099) and extent of colitis (p =0.0273) were significant factors for development of malignancy.

Genomic instability is the hallmark of cancer and microsatellite instability (MSI) is an important factor in tumor development. MSI is a hypermutable phenotype caused by the loss of DNA mismatch repair activity. It is important to identify MSI clinically as they have a better prognosis and differ with response to chemotherapy. Limited data is available on the incidence of MSI in Indian CRCs. The objectives of this study were to identify the extent of MSI in Indian CRC patients below 50 years and determine promoter methylation status of hMLH1 and hMSH2 in relation to MSI. Methods: Ninety-one individuals with CRC were recruited (Bethesda guidelines); patient characteristics were noted down. Colorectal tumors were tested for MSI by NCI recommended Bethesda panel using labeled primers and the fragments were separated and analyzed on Beckman Sequencer. Promoter methylation status was determined by restriction enzyme digestion and PCR. Results: MSI-High was detected in 13.2 % (12/91), MSI-low in 35.2 % (32/91) and the rest were Microsatellite stable (MSS) 51.6 % (47/91). Majority (8/12) of the MSI-H tumors were associated with rectum (site of the tumor, were moderately or poorly differentiated (12/12) and the tumor type was adenocarcinoma (10/12). Promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with instability, both MSI-H and MSI-L. Conclusions: In the present study, MSI, both high and low was associated with 48.4 % of CRC patients below fifty years of age. recognition of HCV by immune system, triggers pathways leading to type-I interferon production, and induce an antiviral state. HCV associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and B cell lymphoma. HCV infection causes a 5 to 10 fold increase in mutation frequency in Ig heavy chain, BCL-6, p53, and \u03b2-catenin genes of in vitro HCV-infected B cell lines and HCV-associated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymphomas, and HCCs, but not in lymphomas of non-viral origin or HBV-associated HCC. HCV induces a mutator phenotype and may transform cells by a hit-and-run mechanism in the host. Gene sequences codes for TRAF6-binding motifs in TRIF 250-PEEMSW-255 and in MAVS, 153-PGENSE-158 and 455-PEENEY-460 were analyzed for mutations by direct sequencing, and IFN-\u03b2 levels from 63 patients of CHC and 38 healthy individuals. We made an effort to confirm these protein interactions by co-immuno precipitation of TRAF6 with MAVS and TRIF isolated from biopsy of 47 chronic hepatitis C patients and 12 autopsy liver tissue and Western blotting. Alignment sequences code for MAVS and TRIF motifs which interacts with TRAF6 revealed they were highly conserved. MAVS and TRIF interact with TRAF6 in CHC patients. Thus there is no association of sequence variations with these protein interactions in CHC patients.

Objective: To clone, sequence and characterize full-length HCV from plasma of patients with GT3a infection. Study design: Molecular characterization of five patients with HCV GT3a infection was performed by assessing its genomic variability with other genotypes and subtypes, by measuring Shannon entropy, analyzing extent of positive selection and performing physico-chemical analysis. Results: Genetic analysis by Shannon entropy measurement revealed two novel hypervariable regions (HVR) within the envelope protein E2 of HCV GT3a, named as HVR496 and HVR576 with a variable 5-8 amino-acid insertion site and a putative N-glycosylation site. Phylogenetic analysis revealed these sequences formed a distinct clade and was of earliest evolving representatives of the HCV GT3a. Evolutionary analysis of E2 region encompassing most of HVR region ie. HVR1, HVR496, and HVR576 showed that positively selected sites were largely restricted to these HVR regions.

High resolution manomtery was done in left lateral position using 16 channel water perfusion system. Basal LES pressures were recorded for 1 minute. Peristalsis was recorded for ten swallows of 5 mL water each. Age and sex distribution, basal and nadir LES pressures and esophageal peristaltic pattern were analyzed in the two groups. Unpaired t test was applied. Results: A total of 46 patients (31-RE and 15-NERD) formed the study group. The age and sex distribution in the two groups was similar. The basal LES pressures were significantly lower (p=0.003) in the RE group. The peristaltic pattern showed normal peristalsis in eleven and nonspecific dysmotility in 4/15 patients with NERD. In patients with reflux esophagitis, normal peristalsis (18/31), nonspecific dysmotility (7/31), hypertensive peristalsis (2/31), absent peristalsis in lower 2/3 of esophagus (3/31) and hypotensive peristalsis (1/31) were noted. Conclusion: Patients with RE have significantly lower LES pressures and show abnormal peristaltic patterns compared to patients with NERD.

Juned Khan, P S Rajan, P Karthikeyan, Amol Shinde, C Palanivelu G E M Hospital and Research Centre, 45, Pankaja Mill Road, Ramanathapuram, Coimbatore 641 045, India Background/Aims : Leak after esophageal anastomosis or perforation has high morbidity and mortality especially due to sepsis, mediastinitis and malnutrition. Management of this is a therapeutic challenge. This study reviews our experience treating postoperative esophageal leaks with the esophageal stent. Methods: Between 2007 and 2012, 11 patients with intrathoracic anastomotic leak after esophagectomy (n=8), perforation following hellers cardiomyotomy (n =3) were treated with endoscopic placement of a removable covered SEMS. The clinical details of these patients were analyzed and recovery pattern studied. Result: Eleven patients had stents placed for leak occlusion after esophagectomy (n =8), or myotomy (n=3). The mean interval between surgical intervention and stent placement was 7 days. Occlusion of the leak occurred in all 11 patients as documented by gastrograffin study on 2nd day following stenting. One patient had stent migration partially which was replaced with another lengthy stent and required feeding jejunostomy also temporarily. None of the other patients had Stent migration or any stent related complications. Eleven stents were removed without residual leak at mean duration of 75\u00b133 days. One patient had a stricture after stent removal that required endoscopic dilatation. Conclusion: The esophageal stent is an effective method for occluding a postoperative esophageal leak.

Intrathoracic leaks, at esophagogastric anastomosis can lead to mediastinitis and sepsis. Early detection and appropriate measures to drain intrathoracic collection and preventing continuing leak into mediastinum should be the aim. Rarely leaks can also occur after Heller's cardiomyotomy. Here we report 3 cases where we used combined thorocoscopy and endoscopic approach to successfully manage intrathoracic leak. Methods: Of the three patients, two had undergone minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma of lower esophagus. Both the leaks were detected on postoperative day 4 when patient developed features of mediastinitis and collection. The third patient had undergone laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy. The leak was detected on postoperative day three. In all three patients the approach to drain the pleural collection was right thoracoscopic with patient in prone position. Thorough drainage and lavage of the mediastinum and right pleural cavity was done. In one case a small segment of the gastric conduit which was discolored at the anastomotic line was excised and re-suturing done.

Its infection is very common affecting approximately 80 % to 90 % of Indian population 2. The cagA gene ie. (cytotoxin-associated gene) is considered to be a marker for the presence of a pathogenicity island (cag PAI), and individuals infected with cagA-positive H. pylori strains have a higher risk of developing peptic ulcers and gastric cancer 4. The vacA gene encodes a vacuolating toxin excreted by H. pylori present in all strains and having two variable parts 5 the s-region (signal) and the m region (middle). Materials and Methods: Sixty-five gastric biopsies were collected from the patients suffering from various gastroduodenal diseases in Guwahati, Assam. Out of 65 biopsies H. pylori was successfully isolated from 10 gastric biopsies. The genomic DNA was isolated by C-TAB method from the isolated strains. For the rest of the 55 biopsies from which we failed to isolated H. pylori, genomic DNA was isolated directly from the biopsies by using mammalian DNA isolation kit (Himedia). Urease PCR was positive in 30 genomic DNA indicating the presence of H. pylori DNA. Multiplex PCR was done for the strains which were urease positive. All the H. pylori strains were cagA, vacA, positive. Results: The average age of the 30 patients included in the study was 38.06 yr. and the M:F ratio was 1:0.5. All the strains were cagA and vac A s1m1 positive (100 %) as shown in Table 1 .

The expression and localization pattern of survivin and STAT3/pSTAT3 was studied by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: Survivin was highly expressed in diffuse and intestinal type of gastric adenocarcinoma in both cytoplasm and nucleus. The intestinal metaplastic and dysplastic tissues showed moderate cytoplasmic expression of survivin with low nuclear involvement. A high STAT3 and pSTAT3 immuno-positivity was invariably detected in nucleus and cytoplasm of majority of adenocarcinoma lesions irrespective of their types. Intestinal metaplasia lesions showed moderate expression of STAT3 diffusely located in cytoplasm while in dysplasia lesions, moderate expression equally localized to nucleus and cytoplasm was observed. The ureC significantly correlated with nuclear survivin in adenocarcinoma lesions. On the contrary, cagA positivity was correlated with cytoplasmic survivin and STAT3 in pre-cancer lesions. Survivin positivity was found strongly associated with STAT3 and pSTAT3 positivity irrespective of subcellular localization of these proteins. The AUCs obtained in normal vs. adenocarcinoma was 0.949 and 0.900 (p <0.001) for cytoplasmic survivin and STAT3, respectively.

Various etiological factors are implicated for its pathogenesis including genetic cause. E-cadherin, VEGF and MMPs expression may be helpful in better understanding of the disease and its potential therapeutic implication. Material and Method: It is a prospective study performed in 73 biopsy samples from gastric carcinoma (n=73) which were collected following surgery/endoscopy. Twenty-seven controls were taken for comparison. Expression of E-cadherin, VEGF, MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-3 was done through RT-PCR. Results: Most of the patients were between age group of 40-60 year (56.2 %). Forty were male and 33 females. Most patients had BMI<18.5 (57.5 %). On tumor histology, 48 (65.8 %) were intestinal type whereas 25 diffuse. E-cadherin was under expressed in 38.4 % cases of gastric carcinoma (p =0.01). However, no correlation of E-cadherin was noted with site of growth, serosal invasion, lymph node or liver metastases. The underexpression of E-cadherin was more pronounced in advance gastric cancer (stage III+IV) (p=0.13).

Its complications include re-obstruction (10 %), stent migration (10 %), persistent pain (5 %), perforation (4 %), pancreatitis (4 %) and bleeding 5 %. Here, we report a case of tumor bleed following SEMS which was successfully managed endoscopically using argon plasma coagulation. Case Report: 38/M, a case of in-operable antropyloric growth who had underwent palliative pyloroduodenal uncovered SEMS placement 2 months back for GOO, presented with history of seven days of melena, abdominal pain and exertional dyspnea. Patient did not have any features of stent obstruction at current presentation. On examination patient was pale and abdomen revealed a hard immobile mass in the epigastrium. Lab investigation was unremarkable except for anemia. The possibilities considered were tumor bleed, SEMS related bleed or bleeding secondary to a cause unrelated to the tumor. Endoscopy revealed multiple areas of diffuse bleed from the tumor surface seen through the uncovered SEMS. The bleed was managed effectively by endotherapy using argon plasma coagulation.

Data from India is very limited with regard to its incidence and hence we did a retrospective study to find out the incidence and endoscopic characteristics of this type of cancers. Methods: In this retrospective study records of all carcinoma stomach patients diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy between May 2009 and June 2013 were analyzed to find out the incidence and endoscopic characteristics of signet ring cell carcinoma of stomach. Results: The total number of stomach cancers diagnosed was 50 out of 3,091 gastroscopies done (1.62 %) and the incidence of signet ring cell carcinoma was 40 % (20 out of 50). The average age of onset is earlier (50 yrs vs. 60 yrs) and male to female ratio is equal (1:1 vs. 4:1) in SRCC when compared to adenocarcinomas. Most common site involved in SRCC of stomach is antrum (75 %), followed by body (65 %) and fundus (35 %). Two patients (10 %) had bilateral ovarian tumors suggestive of Krukenberg's tumor.

Human Defensin-5(HD-5) is a paneth cell specific defensin expressed at the base of small intestine. Reduced expression of HD-5 could compromise mucosal host defenses and predispose to intestinal mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A decrease of the paneth cell\u00b1-defensins can alter the intestinal microbiome allowing mucosal invasion and triggering inflammation. Objective: To evaluate the expression status of HD-5 mRNA in IBD patients in comparison to non-IBD healthy controls. Methods: Biopsies from the terminal ileum were obtained from 24 patients with confirmed IBD (WHO criteria) and 27 non-IBD healthy controls. RNA was extracted and amplified through generation of cDNA. PCR amplification was done for candidate gene (HD-5). Amplicons were resolved through agarose gel electrophoresis and semi-quantified by densitometry. Result: The gene expression of HD-5 was found to be decreased significantly (p=0.03) in IBD patients (0.24) as compared to non-IBD controls (0.32).

Out of the 110 patients, 32 were tested positive (prevalence 29 %). Mean age group was 35 yrs (Range 20-62 years), 21 of these patients had dual deficiency anemia. Discussion: Our study revealed a prevalence of 29 %, which is higher than that reported in various other studies from India. Grading of smears can be used to access response to therapy. Conclusion: In addition to common enteropathogenic organisms, Cryptosporidium is indicated as a key causative agent of diarrhea in humans. In many cases, it can cause persistent recalcitrant diarrhea requiring preventive and therapeutic measures.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis has a chronic relapsing course, characterized by intense eosinophilic infiltrate in one or multiple segments of the intestine (esophagus to rectum) with varying depth of infiltration (mucosal, muscular and serosal) and unpredictability in presenting symptoms. HES is one of the causes for secondary eosinophilic gastroenteritis.

Background : Campylobacter is an important cause of bacterial gastroenteritis with C. jejuni and C. coli being commonly associated. In the present investigation the prevalence of Campylobacters in and around Chandigarh and their antibiotic resistance profile was done. Methods : Stool samples from 1,145 diarrheal patients and 102 healthy subjects from hospital and community were cultured microaerophilically on Campylobacter media for 48 h. The suspected colonies were identified by Gram stain, biochemical and serologic investigations. Molecular confirmation was done using specific primers to unique regions of 16SrRNA, C. jejuni (hipO), C. coli (aspK), C. lari (glyA) and C. upsaliensis (lpxA) genes. Identification of specific genes to look for resistance to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and streptomycin was also done. Results: Campylobacters were isolated from 30 (2.6 %) diarrheal samples but none from healthy subjects. The most frequent serogroups were Group S:27, Group B:2, Group Z5:52 and Group V:32 in descending order. Of the 30 positive patient samples for Campylobacter species, 27 were C. jejuni and 3 were C. coli. DNA amplification revealed C. jejuni in 78.9 %, C. coli in 1.8 % and co-infection of C. coli and C. jejuni in 19.3 % of the cultures but no C. lari or C. upsaliensis. Antibiotic resistance was 40.0 % for nalidixic acid, 23.3 % for ciprofloxacin, 50 % for tetracycline and 20 % for streptomycin. Conclusion : C. jejuni species is most commonly isolated among the Campylobacter diarrheas. High degree of resistance was seen for nalidixic acid and tetracycline and moderate degree of resistance were seen for ciprofloxacin and streptomycin. Background: Clostridium difficile produces two major enterotoxins, Toxins A and B which are responsible for nosocomial diarrhea in patients who receive antibiotics and other medications. The disease can lead to life threatening manifestations like pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. A phenotypic and genotypic investigation of C. difficile isolates obtained from patients reporting to a tertiary care hospital was done. Methods: Fecal samples from 356 patients suspected to have C. difficile infection were incubated overnight anaerobically in Robertson's cooked meat media. From this culture was done directly and after alcohol-shock on Columbia blood agar and incubated for 48 h. Suspected colonies of C. difficile were identified biochemically and also by amplifying speciesspecific triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) gene. Isolates found to be positive for C. difficile by both phenotypic and genotypic methods were further processed for identification of toxins A and B. Toxigenic status of C. difficile was identified both by ELISA and by PCR. Results : Phenotypically and genotypically 29 (8.1 %) C. difficile isolates were obtained. C. difficile toxins A/B were detected by ELISA in 12/29 (41.4 %) of the total isolates. PCR for tcdA and/or tcdB genes were identified in 16 (55 %) of the isolates. Two (12.5 %) of the toxigenic isolates were positive for tcdA alone whereas 5 (31.2 %) of the toxigenic isolates elaborated tcdB gene alone.

In FO+CO(1:1)+DMH and FO+CO(2.5:1)+DMH groups, Bax was increased in postinitiation phase only in comparison to DMH treatment. An increase in Bcl-2 expression initially followed by a decrease in FO+CO(1:1)+DMH and FO+ CO(2.5:1)+DMH groups was observed. Cyto c expression was increased in FO+CO(2.5:1)+ DMH and FO+ CO(1:1)+DMH as compared to DMH treatment. FO+ CO(2.5:1)+DMH administration increased caspase-3 in both phases as compared to FO+CO(1:1)+DMH and DMH animals. In both phases, there was an increase in MMP levels in FO+CO(1:1)+DMH and FO+ CO(2.5:1)+DMH in comparison to DMH group. The chemopreventive action of FO may involve activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway in experimental colon carcinogenesis. Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality can be reduced by the detection and removal of early-stage, treatable neoplasia. There is currently lack of established markers to detect early neoplastic changes. The aim of this study was to determine copy number variations (CNVs) in genes within CNVs as potential markers for the detection of neoplasia in both ulcerative colitis-associated (UC-CRN) and sporadic colorectal neoplasia (S-CRN). Materials and Methods : We employed array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) to identify copy number aberrations in tissue samples of UC nonprogressor, progressor and S-CRC. Microarray study was followed by validation of a panel of markers by using Taqman based real time PCR method along with the microsatellite instability (MSI) status in a subset of samples. Immunohistochemistry analyses were also performed in a subset samples. Results: Integrated analysis showed 10 overlapping regions between UC-Progressor and S-CRC, majorly in 8q and 12p regions, comprising of C-MYC and CCND2 respectively. A panel of 6 genes with or without MSI was successful in detecting neoplasia in S-CRC with overall accuracy of 54 % and 58 % respectively in comparison to 29 % in UC high risk samples. The IHC study showed that p53 and CCND1 were significantly overexpressed in an increasing pattern from high risk pre-neoplastic to neoplastic stages. EGFR and AMACR expressions were observed only in neoplastic conditions of UC-HR samples. Conclusion: Study identifies genomic aberrations in the form of CNVs present in UC-CRN and S-CRN and may help identify genes driving carcinogenesis and further understanding of disease pathogenesis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "LI-9"}, {"text": "Mohd Talha Noor, Satyarth Choudhary, Bhagwan Singh Thakur, Neeraj Jain, Sunil Jain Department of Gastroenterology, Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences, Indore 543 111, India Background : Inflammatory bowel disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. In this study we describe the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease from a tertiary care centre in central India. Methods: Between June 2011 and June 2013, clinical profile of 51 patients with inflammatory bowel disease attending the outpatient and emergency departments of our hospital was analyzed. Evaluation of these patients included history taking, clinical examination, hemogram, liver function tests, stool examination and colonoscopy. Patients of Crohn's disease were classified according to montreal classification. Results: Out of 51 patients, 34 were diagnosed as ulcerative colitis and 17 as Crohn's disease. Among 34 patients (mean age 40.2\u00b110.4 years) of ulcerative colitis 10 (29.4 %) had pancolitis, 9 (26.5 %) left sided colitis, 12 (35.3 %) proctosigmoiditis and 3 (8.8 %) had proctitis. Four (11.8 %) had extraintestinal manifestations (peripheral arthropathy 3, ankylosing spondylitis 1, episcleritis 1). All of these patients were managed medically. Among 17 patients (mean age 37.5 \u00b113.8 years) of Crohns disease, 7 (41.2 %) had nonstricturing, non-penetrating disease (B1), 8 (47.1 %) had stricturing disease (B2) and 2(11.8 %) had penetrating disease (B3).

PLA2s have been implicated in diverse pathological conditions, including inflammation, tissue repair and cancer. The different PLA2s, identif\u00efed to date, can be classif\u00efed into three groups: secreted PLA2 (sPLA2), calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) and calcium-dependent cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2). Aim: To evaluate the role of PLA2 isoforms in cigarette smoke and benzo(a)pyrene-induced molecular changes in colon cancer cells. Materials and Methods: The effects of different concentrations of cigarette smoke and benzo(\u00b1)pyrene at different time interval were assessed on two lineages of colon cancer cells (HCT-15 and HT-29). The effect of cigarette smoke and benzo(\u00b1)pyrene on cell viability, reactive oxygen species, cell membrane integrity, cell apoptosis and proliferation was assessed by MTT, DCFHDA, DHE, DHR123, FDA, AnnexinV-PI, and CYQUANT kit respectively. We screened both cell lines for different PLA2 isoforms expression by using RT-PCR. Results: The cell viability, cell membrane integrity and proliferation, deteriorated with time and increase in cigarette smoke and benzo(\u00b1)pyrene concentration which may be due to increased ROS production and apoptosis. Both the cell lines expressed all the PLA2 isoforms except IIA, IIE, V, and VII.

Methods: PCR-SSCP (Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism) analysis followed by DNA sequencing was used to detect mutations in MCR of Exon 15 of APC and Exon 3 of \u03b2catenin. The concentration of APC and \u03b2-catenin mRNA in tumor, adjoining and distant normal mucosa specimens (35 each) was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The ratio of APC and \u03b2-catenin cDNA copies/\u03b2-actin cDNA copies was used to represent the mRNA expression level in different tissues. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expression pattern of APC and \u03b2-catenin. Results: The frequencies of mutations in MCR of exon 15 of APC and exon 3 of \u03b2-catenin in 35 tumor tissue samples were 45.0 % and 20.0 % respectively. Furthermore, the overall mRNA expression of APC gene was down-regulated and that of \u03b2-catenin gene was up-regulated in tumor tissue samples by 16 fold and 22.5 fold respectively as compared to distant normal mucosa. In addition to this, \u03b2-catenin mRNA levels in tumors with lymph node metastasis positive cases were significantly increased as compared to tumors without lymph node metastasis. The protein expression of APC was decreased and that of \u03b2-catenin was increased in tumor tissue samples as compared to normal and adjoining mucosa.

Further dissection of the NF-kB complex in supershift assays demonstrated complete absence of p65 in the NF-kB complex, which is formed by homodimerization of the p50 component in pregnant FHF patients. Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of p50 and p65 proteins both showed higher levels of p50 expression and a complete absence or a minimal expression of p65, indicating its nonparticipation in NF-kB dependent transactivation in pregnant FHF patients.

His symptoms improved over 48 hours and had gradual resolution of abscess size, IVC compression, proteinuria and other parameters. Discussion: Amebic liver abscess can cause thrombosis of the portal vein or IVC or can compress these veins causing bilateral pedal edema and ascites. But significant IVC compression causing renal vein congestion and leading to a picture like nephrotic syndrome is extremely rare. Huddle reported a case of ALA complicated with nephrotic syndrome due to external IVC compression which recovered after drainage of the abscess. Liver abscess in close proximity to the IVC or hepatic veins, >5 cm in size or with pedal edema or anasarca should undergo CT or doppler USG to demonstrate compression or abnormal flow.

Similar findings have been observed in patients with chronic liver disease. This phenomenon has been termed relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI). We therefore decided to screen for relative adrenal insufficiency in severely stressed chronic liver disease patients and compare them with patients of sepsis. Methods: We enrolled 20 patients with chronic liver disease and 20 patients with severe sepsis. Patients who had received steroids in last 6 weeks were excluded. Cortisol levels were measured by a radioimmune assay technology (Sourcerer RIA counter, Oakfield Health Care). The peak cortisol level was defined as the highest cortisol level obtained after synacthen administration at 60 minutes. The criteria for adrenal insufficiency were defined as follows: baseline value less than 15 mcg/dL (414 nmoL/litre), or cortisol response less than 9mcg/dL (less than 248 nmoL/litre) with a baseline value between 15 and 34 mcg/dL. Results: Adrenal insufficiency is common in patients with both chronic liver disease and severe sepsis. In our study we found the incidence of adrenal insufficiency to be 60 % and 55 % in chronic liver disease and sepsis respectively, In our study mean arterial pressure, serum bilirubin, vasopressin dependency, renal dysfunction and bacteremia were independent factors predicting adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients with chronic liver disease and severe sepsis.

Cancer recurrence occurs in regional lymph nodes (LNs) in substantial number of patients. Routine histopathological examination of resected LNs is unable to diagnose micrometastasis and hence immunohistochemical analysis was initiated. Recently, RT-PCR is being considered more sensitive method. Aim: To study the prevalence of micrometastasis in biliary and pancreatic cancer using RT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry Patients and Methods: Total 71 LNs (68 from cancers and three from non-cancer) were dissected along the hepatoduodenal ligament, common hepatic-artery, celiac-axis, peripancreatic, suprapyloric and infrapyloric region from cholangio, gallbladder and pancreatic carcinoma. Histological examination was made by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry was performed on serial sections of paraffin-embedded tissues using CAM5. Two and K-Ras monoclonal antibodies. Total RNA was isolated and 1\u03bcg was used to prepare cDNA. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in triplicate using syber green and specific primers for K-Ras, MAGE3, CK20 and CEA. 18S RNA was used as the control for normalization. Relative expression of each gene was analyzed by calculating the LogRQ of Ct value. Results: Out of 68 LNs, 23 were positive for malignancy on histopathological examination. Of these positive LNs, 17 showed more than two fold up-regulation of K-Ras, MAGE3, CK20 or CEA gene expression. Most of the nodes were positive for dual expression of K-Ras, MAGE3 or CK20 by RT-PCR. Eighteen HE negative LNs also showed upregulated expression of either one of these genes. However, these nodes did not reveal CAM5.2 and K-Ras staining by IHC.

Caroli's syndrome is associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. There is description of a patient with both OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome) and Caroli's disease along with cystic renal disease occurring in 1:250,000 births it is rare. Most cases appear to be sporadic, but others are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Case Report: We hereby report a case of a 18-year-old female born out of a second degree consanguineous marriage with history of delayed milestones, and past history of recurrent abdominal pain; fever and jaundice requiring multiple admissions since one and half years of age. She presented to us with decompensation in the form of abdominal distension and swelling of legs. Further work up revealed her to be in Child class B. USG abdomen and MRI was done which showed the characteristic bile duct dilatations with portal bundle of vessels passing through which was seen as a \"central dot sign\". Her previous biopsy report was reviewed which was also consistent with a picture of hepatic fibrosis dilated bile ducts and cholestasis leading to a final diagnosis of Carolis disease. She was subsequently counselled and put on a cadaveric deceased liver donor transplant wait list. Conclusion: When one encounters a case of cholestatsis with recurrent cholangitis presenting in a younger age group as our patient among the various differential diagnosis one should keep in mind congenital disorders like Carolis disease. Literature shows that these patients may end up in decompensation ultimately needing liver transplantation as in our case. This case is presented for its rarity, the characteristic central dot sign which was well seen on imaging and to highlight on congenital diseases like Caroli's.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding is an important route for enteral feeding in patients deemed unfit for oral feeding due to various neurological and non-neurological causes. All patients who underwent PEG insertion from January 2011 to January 2013 were included in our study. Out of 105 patients 80 % were male with mean age of 56 years. Intracranial bleed due to road traffic topped the indication followed by stroke and degenerative neurologic diseases. Complication rate was mere 7 % with commonest being peg site infection. Buried bumper syndrome and bleeding were other complications although none necessitated removal of PEG tube. At mean of 100 days about 25 % patients had their tube removed due to clinical improvement. Twenty percent of our patients died due to non-PEG related complication. In conclusion, PEG feeding is an essential and safe feeding route in a set of patients with a minimal risk of complications and negligible mortality.

Hence, we studied the frequency of FM among patients with IBS and healthy controls from India.Conclusion: Fourteen percent of patients with IBS in this study had FM, which was not higher than the frequency among healthy controls.Background: Alterations in the gut microbiota, such as reduction in population of beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and increase in pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa may play a role in pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, we aimed to study fecal Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Pseudomonas in patients with IBS and healthy controls (HC) using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Methods : Three consecutive stool samples were collected from 40 patients with IBS (Rome III criteria) and 30 HC. DNA was extracted from stool samples and quantified. Patients with IBS had pathogenic bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa more often in their feces and in higher number. Number of beneficial bacteria was lower in feces of IBS patients than HC. Hence, we suggest that dysbiosis may play a role in IBS.Siva Sankar Reddy Gangireddy, Shaesta Mehta, Prachi S Patil Department of Digestive Diseases and Clinical Nutrition, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Mumbai 400 012, India", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF11": {"text": "Phenotypic and genotypic investigation of Clostridium difficile isolates obtained from patients reporting to a tertiary care hospital", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF12": {"text": "Rupal Sinha , Showket Hussain, R Suresh Kumar, Kapil Kumar, Pankaj Pande, Shivendra Singh, Dinesh Chandra Doval, Seemi Farhat Basir, Mausumi Bharadwaj Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Institutional Area, Rohini, New Delhi 110 085, Institute of Cytology and Preventive Oncology (ICMR).

Worldwide studies showed radiotherapy for carcinoma prostate as the main cause of CRP. In India carcinoma cervix is the predominant cause. This is the first Indian study to evaluate role of argon plasma coagulation in CRP. Objective: To evaluate -1. The efficacy of APC on rectal bleeding and other symptoms in CRP. 2. Short and long-term complication of APC. 3. Correlation between success of therapy and colonoscopic severity or rectal bleeding score (RBS). Design: Prospective study Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Methods: APC (max 4) treatment sessions given in CRP patients with rectal bleeding score -2, at the interval of 1 month till RBS remained -2. Therapeutic success is RBS -1. Follow up done for 6 months. Colonoscopic severity grading was also done. Results: Forty-two female patients (mean age 51.88 yrs) with carcinoma cervix (37) and carcinoma endometrium (5) patients were studied. Thirty-four (80 %) patients had therapeutic success out of which 50 % had complete cessation of bleeding. Therapeu-Rectal ulcer developed in 7 (17 %) patients. One patient had recurrence of symptoms after 3 months of follow up. Conclusion: APC is excellent treatment modality in mild and moderate CRP but less effective in severe CRP.Preprobiotics vs. rifaximin in the treatment of IBS-DPravir Gambhire, Samit Jain, Piyush Somani, Q Contractor, Pravin Rathi Department of Gastroenterology, T N Medical College and B Y L Nair Hospital, Mumbai Central, Mumbai 400 008, India Background: IBS is a chronic condition with no known cure. Clinically important benefits might be achieved in patients with preprobiotics particularly in those with diarrheapredominant symptoms in light of alterations in commensal enteric bacterial species in this subset. There is also accumulating evidence pointing towards the benefit of a short course of rifaximin in the global improvement of patients with IBS-D.Aims and Objectives: To assess the efficacy of preprobiotics vs. rifaximin for patients with IBS-D. Materials and Methods : It was a comparative parallel randomized study. Male/female patients between 18 to 65 yrs, with a diagnosis of IBS as per Rome III criteria, were included, the patients in the preprobiotic arm were given perprobiotics for 14 days while those in the rifaximin arm got Tab 400 mg TID for 14 days. The patients were interviewed at baseline and weekly for 4 weeks; the parameters to scale the symptoms included likert scale, subjective global assesement score and irritable bowel syndrome score. Stastical Analysis : Qualitative data was represented in form of frequency and percentage. Association between qualitative variables was be assesed by chi-square test. Before -after comparison of qualitative data within each group was be done using McNemar Test. Quantitaive data was be represented using mean\u00b1SD and median and IQR (Interquartile range). Results: Significant improvements in global symptoms of IBS (p<0.05) and bloating (p<0.05) throughout the 4-week follow up in the rifaximin group, although differences in relief of diarrhea, and generalized ill feeling between the two groups were not significant. Conclusions: Short course of rifaximin was better than the preprobiotics in the IBS-D subset.Invalidity of ROME III criteria in diagnosing Indian patients with irritable bowel syndrome Gautam Ray B R Singh Hospital, Sealdah, Kolkata 700 014, IndiaBackground: Though Rome III criteria is used to diagnose IBS in West, the same is not validated in India where normal bowel habit is quite different. Methods: A questionnaire in English (and in local vernacular) containing questions of ROME III criteria was administered to 100 patients consulting for symptoms of IBS who had normal colonoscopy (39), sigmoidoscopy (61) and negative stool OBT. All had normal hemoglobin, ESR, blood sugar and thyroid status. Bristol Stool Scale. Symptoms were abdominal pain 23/ discomfort 54, bloat 21, mucus in stool 94 [all >25 % time], visible distension in none, more frequent/looser stool with pain onset 65/72, relief with stool passage 53, passing stool after meals 67, straining at stool in none, pain at least 3 days/ month and 3 months/year 75, milk intolerance leading to stoppage of taking milk 96. Thirty-seven felt they had no diarrhea and 11 felt constipated with incomplete evacuation even when passing 3 stools/day. Conclusion: Rome III criteria is invalid in Indian patients. Patients' feeling of incomplete evacuation and mucus in stool are important as also associated milk intolerance.An evaluation of the symptom of constipation in Indian patientsGautam Ray B R Singh Hospital, Sealdah, Kolkata 700 014, IndiaBackground: Normal bowel habit of Indians is quite different from the West and hence the definition of constipation but this has not been appropriately studied. Methods: Seventy consecutive patients complaining of sub-Conclusions: A feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation is interpreted as constipation in India, most have benign neuromuscular etiology due to drug intake or comorbid illness. Most consulters are elderly males. The definition of constipation needs to be coined by large scale populaton studies. To study the clinical profile, categorize and compare various subtypes of primary constipation. 2) To assess success of biofeedback therapy (BFT) in DD. Material and Methods: Consecutive constipation patients (April 2011-December 2012) were evaluated. Patients <18 years and secondary constipation were excluded. 'FC' and 'C-IBS' were classified by Rome-3 module. Patients underwent FBS, calcium, TFT, stool examination, colonoscopy, anorectal manometry (ARM) with balloon expulsion test and colon transit study (CTS). Patients with DD were given BFT. Results: Out of 128 patients 23 %, 58 % and 19 % had secondary constipation, FC and C-IBS respectively. Ninety-nine patients had primary constipation. Mean age-53.50 (18-86) years, (77 % males). Forty-six, 15 and 40 had NTC, STC, DD respectively. 34/40 had paradoxical anal contraction and 6/40 had impaired rectal propulsion. 'FC' and 'C-IBS', were clinically and pathophysiologically similar except for abdominal pain. Patients with DD were more likely to have history of finger evacuation, straining, incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction than no DD (p <0.001). Sixty-nine percent patients with STC had \u22643 stools/ week compared to 37 % with NTC. 30/40 patients with DD underwent BFT but 20 completed \u22654 sessions. Seventy percent with \u22654 sessions had improved CSBM with increase in anal relaxation time. Conclusion: NTC is most common subtype of primary constipation. Symptom profile can predict pathophysiologic subtype but investigations (ARM and CTS) are needed to confirm them. DD showed good response to BFT.Prevalence of hyponatremia in treatment nai\u00c3\u00afve patients with cirrhosis and ascitesBackground: Serum sodium is a simple, readily available and objective marker of disease severity in cirrhosis. Several studies have shown that hyponatremia is a strong predictor of early mortality. Moreover, the accuracy of MELD -Na has been shown to be slightly superior to that of MELD in candidates for transplantation. The present study was done to determine the prevalence of hyponatremia (serum sodium<130 meq/L) in treatment na\u00efve patients of cirrhosis and ascites during their first hospital admission Methods: This is a prospective and observational study. It enrolled 125 consecutive treatment na\u00efve patients of cirrhosis and ascites who were admitted for the first time at Jagjivanram Hospital, Mumbai and Choithram Hospital and Research Centre, Indore between May 2008 to March 2013. A detailed history regarding use of diuretics, antibiotics, albumin, intravenous fluids, previous episodes of ascites and therapeutic paracentesis was taken. Diagnosis of cirrhosis and ascites was confirmed by clinical, radiological, endoscopic and laboratory investigations. Serum sodium levels were sent within two hours of admission. The data collected was analyzed to determine prevalence of hyponatremia. Results: The mean age of patients was 54.92 years (23-78 years). The majority of patients were males (80 %). Thirty-four patients had serum sodium levels of <130 meq/L. Majority of these patients (29, 85.3 %) had serum sodium levels between 120-129 meq/L while two patients had serum sodium levels below 110 meq/L. Three patients had serum sodium levels between 111 to 119 meq/L. The mean MELD score was 20.94 (range 7-39). Twenty-four patients had MELD score of more than 15 while only one patient had a score of <9. Conclusions: The prevalence of hyponatremia in treatment na\u00efve patients with cirrhosis and ascites during first hospital admission is 20.7 %. It is more common in patients with MELD score of >15 suggesting the presence of advanced liver disease.Utility of serum pro-BNP as a marker of cardiac dysfunction in liver cirrhosis B Varun Rao, K Panduranga Rao, B Ramesh Kumar, K Venugopal Reddy Background: Unrecognized cardiac dysfunction is a cause for increased mortality in the peri trans-plant period (arrhythmias and overt heart failure) and after TIPS (pulmonary edema). Aim: 1) To find the prevalence of cardiac dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis. 2) To study utility of serum pro-BNP as a marker of cardiac dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: Total of 85 patients with cirrhosis were included in the study after satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria between September 2011 to September 2013. All of them underwent evaluation for presence of cardiac dysfunction by 2D-Echo (systolic/diastolic dysfunction) and ECG (QT Prolongation). Serum pro-BNP was measured in all the patients. Patients were divided into two groups group A -those with cardiac dysfunction, group B -those without cardiac dysfunction. Clinical and biochemical indices in both the groups were compared. Results: Out of 85 patients Child A-18, Child B-39, Child C-28. A total of 38 (44.7 %) patients had cardiac dysfunction. Prevalance of cardiac dysfunction was more in Child C 21/28 (75 %) compared to Child B 15/39 (38.46 %) and Child A 2/ 18 (11.11 %). Out of 85 patients corrected QT interval was prolonged in 30/85 (35.29). QT prolongation was more common in Child C (46.42 %) compared to Child B (35.89 %) and Child A (16.66 %). QT was prolonged in 21/38 (55.26 %) patients with diastolic dysfunction. Serum pro BNP was elevated in 33/38 (86.84 %) patients with cardiac dysfunction. Mean serum pro-BNP levels are higher in Child C compared to Child A, B. The levels also correlate with MELD score. Conclusions: Prevalence of cardiac dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis is 44.7 %. Pro-BNP is elevated in majority of the patients with cardiac dysfunction (86.84 %). Higher mean levels of pro-BNP are seen in Child C as compared to Child A, B. The levels also correlate with MELD score.Background and Aim of Study : To estimate the prevalence of portal hypertensive polyps in patients with portal hypertension due to any etiology.Patients and Methods: This is a prospective observational study of patients with portal hypertensive polyps. All patients in age group of 18 to 80 years who had portal hypertension diagnosed by clinical, laboratory and imaging criteria who went upper GI scopy from the period of May 2012 to April 2013 were included in the study. Diagnosis of portal hypertensive polyps was confirmed histologically. Patients with proton pump inhibitor use, gastric varices, H. pylori gastritis, history of inherited polyposis syndromes, patients who refused consent were excluded. Results: A total of 3,621 upper GI endoscopies were done of which 428 patients had portal hypertension. Polyps were noted in 9 patients (2.1 %), out of 428 patients 366 had chornic liver disease and 62 had extrahepatic portal hypertention. Out of them 1 was excluded due to rapid urease test positivity. Histopathological examination showed four had extensive vascular proliferation and glandular hyperplasia (portal hypertensive polyp) two had hyperplastic polyp and other two had neuroendocrine tumor. Endoscopic appearances of polyps varied considerably, with sizes ranging from 5 mm to 15 mm. Polyps were sessile or pedunculated, singular or multiple, found in the antrum, body of the stomach. There is no specific endoscopic features to identify portal hypertensive polyps. Conclusion: Portal hypertensive polyps are rare. There is no specific endoscopic features. Biopsy is necessary for diagnosis. Long-term studies are needed to characterize their significance.Budd-Chiari syndrome in abdominal tuberculosis-causative or coincidental: A rare case reportS Sathiamoorthy, T S Rameshkumar, H Azimudin, M G Manoj, Manimaran, Chitra, Murali, Malarvizhi, M S Revathy, A R Venkateswaran Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Government Stanley Medical College, Chennai 600 001, IndiaBackground: Tuberculosis (TB) as a cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) has less been documented in literature. Here we report a rare case of BCS in abdominal TB. Case Report: A 21-year-young female, admitted with history of abdominal distension, abdominal pain of 3 months duration. Evaluated elsewhere, diagnosed as cryptogenic cirrhosis refered for liver transplant registration to our center. Patient was reevaluated. Past history of antituberculous treatment (ATT) for well documented tuberculous ascites in 2009 for 6 months following which patient improved symptomatically. Her physical examination was normal except prominent back veins, moderate ascites and spleenomegaly. Her LFT was normal. Ascites fluid analysis: low SAAG, high protein. ADA normal. Cytology negative for malignant cells. USG abdomen with portal vein doppler:coarse, irregular liver with caudate lobe hypertropy. Right, middle and left hepatic vein occluded with comma shaped collaterals, spleenomegaly with ascites. OGD Scopy: grade 3 to 2 esophageal varices with PHG. Underwent EVL. CECT abdomen: irregular liver with caudate lobe hypertrophy, hepatic veins could not be visualized, spleenomegaly with ascites, ileocecal thickening with pulled up contracted cecum. Prothrombotic work up normal. Colonoscopy: passed up to cecum, ileum not intubated. Ulceroproliferative lesion in semilunar fold biopsy done. HPE report-chronic inflammatory pathology. Conclusion: Development of BCS in the background of abdominal tuberculosis is less reported.This case is reported due to rare occurance.Aim: To study the frequency of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in liver cirrhosis patients and its correlation with severity of liver disease. Method: This is a case series study conducted in Department of Digestive Health and Disease, a tertiary care centre in Chennai over the period from July 2012 to March 2013. First, resting ECG was done in all enrolled cirrhotic patients. QTc values were calculated and value >0.44 sec were considered as prolonged. Systolic dysfunction was assessed by reduced ejection fraction (value <55 %). Diastolic dysfunction assessed by reduced E/A ratio (value <1 was present in 20 (30 %) cases, prolong QT interval (>0.44 sec) in 16 (22.8 %) and ejection fraction (EF) <0.55 was in 11 (15.7 %) patients. Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy was present in 25 (35.7 %) cases and frequency correlates directly with severity of liver disease. There was no significant difference in frequency of CCM among alcoholics and nonalcoholics. Conclusion: We observed that cirrhotic cardiomyopathy was present in 25 percent of our cirrhotic patients and significantly more in Child C. Presence of this clinical entity may have major impact on prognosis in these patients.Acute kidney injury at admission and its response to terlipressin as a predictor of mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure Ankur Jindal, Manoj Kumar, Shiv Kumar Sarin Department of Hepatology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, Vasant Kunj Marg, New Delhi 110 070, India Background : Unlike decompensated cirrhotics, the prevalence, associated complications, mortality and treatment outcomes for acute kidney injury (AKI) in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are less well defined. Methods: Consecutive acute-on-chronic liver failure patients with AKI [serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL] at admission were compared with controls for short-term (7 day) and long-term (1, 3 month) mortality and development of HE, SBP and acute variceal bleed (AVB). Patients were further compared based on severity of AKI (mild AKI; S.cr 1.5-3 mg/dL; severe AKI; S.cr > 3 mg/dL). days and had lower mortality compared to non-responders (10 % vs. 44.3 %, p =0.05). There was no difference in terlipressin response rates in mild vs. severe AKI. Conclusion: Almost one fourth of the ACLF patients have AKI at admission and presence of AKI, but not its severity, predicts the development of complications and high mortality. Terlipressin is effective in reversing AKI in~35 % of patients within a week and results in improved survival.Noninvasive assessment of portal hypertension: A retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital Sanket Shah, Amandeep, M M Prabhu, Naresh Medicine Department, Kasturba Hospital, Manipal 576 104, IndiaIt is currently recommended that all patients with liver cirrhosis undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) to identify those who have large esophageal varices that carry a high risk of bleeding and may benefit from prophylactic measures. This approach leads to unnecessary UGIE in those without large esophageal varices. This prospective study was conducted for 130 patients in a tertiary care hospital to evaluate noninvasive predictors of large varices (LV). Specificity and sensitivities were assessed for the each measure.Clinical and etiological profile of patients with decompensated chronic liver disease at a tertiary care centre Jatin Patel, Prasad Bhate, Dhaval Gupta, Meghraj Ingle, Aniruddha Phadke, Prabha Sawant Department of Gastroenterology, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400 022, IndiaAim: To study the clinical and etiological profile of patients with decompensated chronic liver disease. Methods: Patients with decompensated liver disease admitted in our hospital between May 2011 and May 2013 were included in study. After detailed history and examination all patients underwent routine blood investigations (hemogram, liver function tests, renal function tests, prothrombin time), ascitic fluid investigations, autoimmune markers, viral markers, s.ceruloplasmin, ultrasonography with doppler and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. urine output in 6.55 % patients. Most common etiology of decompensated liver disease was alcoholic liver disease in 56.23 % patients followed by hepatitis B in 19.66 %, cryptogenic in 12 %, autoimmune hepatitis in 3.8 %, hepatitis C in 2.75 %, Budd-Chiari syndrome in 2.54 % and others in 2.96 % patients.

To study the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in DCLD patients. 2. To correlate with clinical, lab parameters and scoring system. Materials and Methods: One hundred decompensated cirrhotic patients with suspected SBP, admitted to our hospital over a period of one year were included in our study after excluding other causes. They were assessed based on history, examination, investigations including ascitic fluid analysis and followed up for one month. Results : Among 100 patients, 29 patients had SBP. Among 29 patients, 7 had culture proven SBP and 22 had culture negative neutrocytic ascities (CNNA). The common presentation were worsening of abdominal distension -29 patients (100 %), Hepatic encephalopathy -13 patients (44.82 %), fever and abdominal pain 11 patients (37.93 %) and UGI bleed 6 patients (20.69 %). All SBP patients had ascitic fluid albumin 25, 18 (62.06 %) and 8 (27.58 %) patients with score between 16 -24 and <15 respectively. Five (62.50 %) patients died during follow up, of which 4 had classic SBP and 1 with CNNA. Among those 5 patients, 2 developed HRS, 1 had UGI bleed and 1 had hepatic encephalopathy. Conclusion : 1. Cirrhotic patient with SBP can have atypical presenting symptoms. Hence high degree of suspicion is required to rule out SBP and manage appropriately. 2. Cirrhotic patients with low ascitic albumin and with high CTP and MELD score are more prone to develop SBP. 3. Mortality increases with associated complications.AKI in patients with acute on chronic liver failure is different from patients with cirrhosisBackground and Aims : The current definitions for AKI (AKIN criteria) and HRS have been derived from patients with cirrhosis with paucity of data on AKI in acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). We investigated the prevalence, natural history and outcome of AKI and Type 1 HRS in patients with ACLF (n=534) and compared it with a cohort of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis (n =2,083). Methods: Serial creatinine up to day 30 was recorded for all patients. p=0.001) and progression to ATN and need of RRT (53.8 % vs. 20.4 %; p<0.0001) was higher for patients with ACLF and type 1 HRS.

Objective: To look into the clinical presentation, lab parameters, etiological factors, radiological features, morbidity and mortality in patients of EHPVO on different treatment modalities. Design: Retrospective cum prospective Methods: Extensive demographic lab data, radiological data, anthropometric assessment, endoscopic and interventional data, surgical data from consecutive patients diagnosed and registered since 1982 and those registered prospectively from August 2007 to January 2010 with the Departments of Gastroenterology and Surgical Gastroenterology was revived. Data on the diagnostic work up, etiological profile, endoscopic follow up, complications and their management was also noted. Consecutive patients on pharmacotherapy, EST/EVL alone and patients who had undergone devascularization or shunt were assessed for their outcome. Results: A total of 240 patients, 125 males and 145 children with mean follow up of 9.3\u00b17.7 years were registered. Main presenting symptoms were upper GI bleed, symptomatic splenomegaly, growth retardation, hypersplenism, jaundice, cholangitis and non specific pain abdomen. Thirty-three percent of children had relevant past history especially umbilical and abdominal sepsis. 7.5 % of children had congenital anomalies. Transabdominal ultrasound was initial important informative investigation. CECT, ERCP, MRCP were also found informative supplementary investigations. Eighty-two percent of patients had esophageal varicies, 16 % had gastric varicies and 7.5 % had PHGP. Thirty-four percent had growth retardation. Recurrent GI bleeds and biliopathy were important complications followed by hypersplenism, growth retardation and decompensated liver disease. Previously described classification of biliopathy was found in-adequate and uninformative, a new classification designed to address the severity of biliopathy was used. Surgery was found better treatment modality, especially shunt procedure; however an optimal treatment modality needs to be discovered. Limitations: A retrospective cum prospective study, complete etiological profile not available. Conclusion: EHPVO is an important cause of portal hypertension in both children and adults and an important cause of morbidity. GI bleed and symptomatic splenomegaly are most common presenting symptoms. Esophago gastric varices are important cause of morbidity. Biliopathy, growth retardation and hypersplenism need early surgical intervention.

AP begins as a local inflammation of the pancreas resulting from acinar cell injury, which eventually mounts a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Even though several mechanisms of AP have been suggested by experimental studies in murine models, the precise mechanisms are not clear in humans. Aim: The aim of the present work was to elucidate the response of human pancreatic acini to bile acids, a known causative factor for AP. Methods: Human pancreatic tissue was collected from the patients who underwent pancreatic surgery for indications other than malignancy/chronic pancreatitis. Harvested pancreata were cut into small blocks, which were then sliced into thin sections of 140 \u03bcm. Trypsin activity was measured at 37oC fluorimetrically using Kawabata's method while cathepsin B activity was assayed by McDonald and Ellis method after exposing the tissue to 300 and 500 \u03bcM taurolithocolic acid (TCLS) for different time points. H&E stain was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue blocks to evaluate histological changes of tissue injury. Result: Functionality of the pancreatic tissue slices was established by the secretion of amylase into the medium in response to secretagogues. There were 15 and 20 folds increase in the trypsin and cathepsin B activities respectively when exposed to 500\u03bcM for 2 hrs. H&E staining showed patchy degeneration of acinar tissue. The acinar cell cytoplasm in these areas appeared pale and edematous; and there were several pyknotic nuclei indicating necrosis. Conclusion : TLCS can cause necrosis of acinar tissue of human pancreas.Introduction: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterized by irreversible pancreatic damage resulting in exocrine/ endocrine dysfunction.

Methods: Fifty consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) within 3 days of symptom onset and 31 age and sex matched healthy controls were studied. Patients were tested for urinary and serum NGAL levels (ELISA), (within 24 hours of admission) and once in controls. Results : Pancreatitis patients were aged 13-85 yrs (males 60 %), with 31 age and sex matched controls. ALI was seen in 28 patients (56 %), with 19 (67.85 %) having persistent and 9 (32.15 %) having transient ALI. The mean serum and urine NGAL levels (587.66\u00b1251.5 ng/mL and 252.84\u00b1165.89 ng/mL) were significantly higher in patients with AP than in controls (15.10\u00b16.29 and 4.26\u00b14.57 ng/mL respectively). After excluding patients with ALI on day 1{13 patients (46.42 %)}, patients who developed ALI had significantly higher serum and urine NGAL levels compared to those who did not (p=0.014 and 0.006 respectively). Both serum and urine NGAL (cut-off 690.19 ng/mL, AUC-0.72 and 258.38 ng/mL, AUC 0.74) predicted ALI with good sensitivity and specificity (73 % to 73 % vs. 67 % to 71 % respectively). Similarly urine NGAL was able to predict persistent ALI at a cutoff of 258.38 ng/mL with a sensitivity and specificity of 72 % and 70 % respectively (AUC-0.713, sig. 0.032). Conclusion: ALI is the most common organ failure seen in AP with >50 % presenting at onset. Persistent ALI has high mortality (32 %). Serum and urine NGAL levels are higher in patients of ALI compared to controls. Urine NGAL (day 1) is a novel biomarker which predicts ALI with good accuracy.Natural history of acute kidney injury in patients with acute pancreatitisPradeep K Siddappa , Jahangeer Basha, Manish Manrai, Sreekanth Appasani, N Kalra, S K Sinha, K Singh, R Kochhar Departments of Gastroenterology, and Radiology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160 012, India Aim: To study the natural history of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients of acute pancreatitis (AP). Methods: Fifty consecutive patients with AP within 3 days of symptom onset were followed, fate of AKI patients recorded. AKI was defined according to Atlanta classification. Results: Patients were aged 13-85 yrs (males 60 %) and were followed till discharge or death. AKI developed in 21 (42 %) of which 11 (52.38 %) had persistent and 10 (47.62 %) had transient AKI. Of the 11 persistent AKI, AKI resolved in 5 (45.45 %) and 6 (54.54 %) patients died. Four (36.6 %) of these required dialysis (3HD+1PD) of whom 3 died. None of the patients with transient AKI required dialysis, but 4 died in this group (mostly to other organ failure and sepsis). Ten (47.6 %) patients had AKI on day 1, 7 (70 %) persistent and 3 (30 %) transient AKI. Of the remaining 5 with persistent AKI, 3 had onset on day 2 and 1 each on day 6 and 9. Of the remaining 7 with transient AKI, 5 had onset on day 2 and 1 had onset on day 14. Fever requiring antibiotics was seen in all patients who developed AKI beyond first 2 days. Thirteen had both ALI and AKI at the same time, with 6 of these having hypotension, none survived.Conclusion: AKI is a common complication of AP, half of them presenting at onset. Persistent AKI have high mortality (>50 %). Half of patients with AKI also have associated ALI and those with triple organ failure have 100 % mortality. Patients who develop AKI later than first 2 days have associated sepsis. Does aggressive fluid resuscitation alter the clinical course of acute pancreatitis?

Intravenous fluid was infused as 20 mL/kg bolus till a base line CVP of 8 cm of normal saline and at a rate of 3-5 mL/kg/hr to maintain a CVP of 8-12 cm of NS and urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Patients were divided into aggressive group (n=19, 38 %) and nonaggressive group (n=31, 62 %) based on fluids received either >33 % or 2 weeks (58.06 % vs. 47.36 %, p=0.461). However, in patients who received >10 liters of fluid at the end of day 5, had more frequent presence of pancreatic necrosis, infective complication, organ failure, need for mechanical ventilation, dialysis, increased hospital, ICU stay with increased mortality. Conclusion: Aggressive fluid resuscitation in the 0-24 hours is associated with decreased frequency of pancreatic necrosis, decreased need for mechanical ventilation and overall decreased need for ICU stay and subsequent mortality.Does the type of fluid used in resuscitation matter in the clinical course of acute pancreatitis? P Vasudevan, G R Verma, Ashish Bhalla, Naveen Kalra, Jahangeer Basha, Sreekanth Appasani, Puneet Chhabra, Manish Manrai, Saroj Kant Sinha, Kartar Singh, Rakesh Kochhar Departments of Gastroenterology, Surgery, Internal Medicine and Radiology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160 012, IndiaAim: To evaluate whether the type of fluid, Ringer lactate or normal saline used in resuscitation matter in the clinical course of acute pancreatitis. Methods: Fifty consecutive patients (mean age: 41.64, n = 33 males) of acute pancreatitis >18 yrs of age presenting within 5 days of onset of pain between January 2012 and June 2013 were subjected to complete demographic profile, clinical and laboratory evaluation. Hemodynamic parameters were assessed along with a central venous pressure and an hourly urine output intravenous fluid was infused as 20 mL/kg bolus till a base line CVP of 8 cm of normal saline and at a rate of 3-5 mL/kg/hr to maintain a CVP of 8-12 cm of NS and urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/hr. Patients were randomized into 2 groups to receive either 0.9 % normal saline or ringer lactate for resuscitation and were compared for outcome parameters. Results : Alcohol was the most common etiology (n =30, 60 %) followed by gallstone disease (n=19, 38 %). Patients in the ringer lactate subgroup had lower percentage of pancreatic necrosis (20 % vs. 32 %, p=0.33), less incidence of organ failure (68 % vs. 80 %, p =0.33), less duration of hospital stay >2 weeks (44 % vs. 64 %, p=0.15), less need for ICU stay (32 % vs. 52 %, p=0.152), less development of infective complications (28 % vs. 40 %, p=0.37) and less need for intervention (32 % vs. 24 %, p=0.529) though the difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Patients who received ringer lactate showed a trend towards less incidence of morbidity than those who were resuscitated with normal saline.Natural history of gastrointestinal f istulae in acute pancreatitisJahangeer Basha, Vikas Gupta, G R Verma, Thakur Deen Yadav, Naveen Kalra, Puneet Chhabra, Sreekanth Appasani, Manish Manrai, Saroj Kant Sinha, Kartar Singh, Rakesh Kochhar Departments of Gastroenterology, Surgery and Radiology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160 012, IndiaObjective: To evaluate the prevalence, clinical course and outcome of gastrointestinal (GI) fistulization in acute pancreatitis (AP). Methods: All patients of AP with GI fistulae detected both in retrospective(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) and prospective (2010-2013) analysis were studied for demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, etiology of pancreatitis, interval between onset of pancreatitis and stulization, diagnostic studies, treatment (including surgery), and outcome. Results: GI fistulization occurred in 38 patients (mean age 39.03\u00b112.2 years; 35 males). The interval between onset of AP and detection of fistulae was 5.84\u00b15.2 weeks. The commonest feature was persistent fever (68.4 %), followed by GI bleed (50 %) and pain abdomen (34.2 %). Fistulae developed spontaneously 73.7 % the rest had history of surgical or percutaneous intervention. The commonest site of fistulae was duodenum Patients who had GI bleed had significantly higher chance of colonic fistulae (p =0.05) and worse outcome (p =0.036). The need for surgical intervention and mortality were significantly higher in colonic than upper GI fistulae (p =0.008 and 0.003). Conclusion: Development of GI fistulae in patients with AP is an ominous and uncommon complication requiring high index of suspicion. GI bleed as a presenting feature and colonic location are adverse prognostic factors requiring surgical intervention and higher mortality.Non relief of pain by endoscopic therapy in chronic calcific pancreatitis is a predictor of poor response to surgical treatment Chitta Ranjan Panda, Haribhakti Seba Das, Bijay Misra, Debasish Misra, Shivaram Prasad Singh Department of Gastroenterology, S C B Medical College, Cuttack 753 007, IndiaBackground: Duct decompression by pancreatic sphincterotomy and stent placement in chronic calcific pancreatitis with dilated MPD is a good short-term method of relief of pain, as an alternative to surgical treatment. Aim: To determine whether surgical procedure helps in those patients where endoscopic procedure failed to relieve pain. Methods: Fifteen patients of chronic calcific pancreatitis who presented with intractable pain not responding to medical line of treatment and underwent pancreatic endotherapy, were included in the study from January 2010 to March 2013. Patients who did not respond to endoscopic therapy underwent surgery. Results: Twelve patients were male and 3 were female. Mean patient age was 35.5years (18 yrs -44 yrs). Six patients had alcoholic pancreatitis and 9 had idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. All patients had dilated main pancreatic ducts with calculi and/or stricture. Pancreatic sphincterotomy with stenting done in all patients, with dilatation of stricture whenever indicated. Stent exchanges were carried out on demand. Over a mean follow up period of 18 months (8-24 months) significant pain relief was achieved in 12 out of 15 patients. Three patients who did not respond at all to pancreatic stenting underwent surgical lateral pancreatojejonostomy procedure. Pain recurred in all the three cases within three months following surgery. Conclusion: Non relief of pain after pancreatic endotherapy in chronic calcific pancreatitis is predictor of poor response to surgery in those cases.Bijay Misra, Haribhakti Seba Das, C R Panda, S P Singh, Debasish Misra, Sanjib Kumar Kar, Manas Kumar Panigrahi Department of Gastroenterology, S C B Medical College, Cuttack 753 007, India Background and Aim: Chronic pancreatitis and its complications has significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to analyze the complications seen in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Material and Methods: All patients of chronic pancreatitis seen during last 3 years were included in the study with special reference to its complications. They underwent routine biochemical examination, USG, X-ray chest and abdomen, CT scan, upper GI endoscopy, Doppler study, MRCP, ERCP and angiography as and when required for diagnosis of the disease and its different complications. Results: Total 104 patients of chronic pancreatitis with M: F ratio of 78:26, age range of 9-75 years and mean age of 39.16+13.12 were studied for complication. Etiology was alcoholic in 51, idiopathic in 50, sickle cell disease in one, familial in 2 cases. Complications seen were pseudocyst in 24, ascites in 19, splenic artery aneurysm in 2, pancreatico pleural fistula in 2, portal vein thrombosis in 3 and duodenal obstruction in 3, paniculitis with skin nodules were seen in one case. Benign head mass was present in 4 patients, malignancy in 3 and IPMN in 2 cases. Splenic vein thrombosis leading to fundic varices was observed in two cases. Diabetes was seen in 15 cases. Exocrine deficiency leading to steatorrhea was noted in 4 patients. Acute exacerbation with pancreatic necrosis was seen in 4 cases. Conclusion : Pseudocyst and pancreatic ascites are the commonest complication. Alcoholic and idiopathic pancreatitic do not show much difference in terms of complication. peripancreatic with distant and pancreatic with peripancreatic/ distant collections. Outcome parameters compared between different groups were organ failure, need for organ support, need for intervention, hospital and ICU stay and mortalty. Results: Overall, 151 (79.9 %) patients had fluid collections and 38 (20.1 %) had no collections. Presence of collections in peripancreatic area along with distant collections increased the morbidity and mortality along with need for intervention suggesting a different protocol for management of collections as per the location.Pancreatic stellate cells contribute to intra islet inflammatory milieu in chronic pancreatitisConclusion: Fluid collections developed in 80 % of AP and most were peripancreatic or distant or combination. ANCs occurred in 93.4 % of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, of whom, 20 % resolved and rest developed WON. APFCs developed in 22.2 % of interstitial pancreatitis and all of them resolved except 1, developed a pseudocyst.Introduction: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterized by irreversible destruction of pancreatic tissue resulting in exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. The prevalence of CP is high in India (114-200/100,000 population). N43S in the Spink1 gene is significantly associated with Indian CP, however SPINK1 polymorphism is only a disease modifier and additional polymorphisms interacting/modifying the Spink1 gene have to be identified. CFTR is an important gene in this context. The objective of this study was to genotype individuals with and without CP for 4 mutations in CFTR gene, N34S in Spink1 gene and N29I; R122H in the PRSS1 gene. Methods: One hundred and twenty-five individuals with CP and 50 healthy controls were recruited. ARMS-multiplex PCR was employed to genotype individuals for 4 CFTR mutations namely \u00ef, F508, G551D, G542X and 621+1G>T. Primers flanking the polymorphisms in SPINK1 and PRSS1 genes were designed and genotyped by direct DNA sequencing. Results: Only 1 individual from CP and none from control group had \u00ef, F508 mutation in the CFTR gene. None of the other mutations of the CFTR or PRSS1 gene were seen either in the CP or control group. Of the 125 from the CP group, 58.54 % were wild type, 29.27 % were heterozygous and 12.20 % were homozygous for the SPINK1 polymorphism. SPINK1 polymorphism in the control group was seen to be 2.76 % from our earlier study. Conclusions: Mutations in the CFTR gene were not significantly associated with CP in the present study in Indian subjects.Anurag J Shetty, C Ganesh Pai, Ganesh Bhat, Sumit Bhatia Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal 576 104, India Introduction: Biliary obstruction in chronic calcific pancreatitis (CCP) is often caused by inflammatory or fibrotic strictures of the bile duct, carcinoma of head of pancreas or less commonly by compression from pseudocysts. Pancreatic calculi causing ampullary obstruction and leading to obstructive jaundice is extremely rare. Methods: A hospital based retrospective study was done. The medical records of all patients with CCP or biliary obstruction who underwent ERCP over 3 years between 2010-2013 in Kasturba Medical College, Manipal were analyzed. Results: Three cases of CCP with impacted pancreatic calculi at the ampulla identified. All 3 patients presented with biliary obstruction and 2 of these patients had features of cholangitis. All 3 patients were incidentally detected to have chronic calcific pancreatitis when evaluated for biliary obstruction. Imaging-CT/ERCP showed biliary dilatation down to the ampulla with a pancreatic calculus at the ampulla. There were no intrapancreatic biliary stricture/neoplasm/pseudocyst causing biliary obstruction. All the patients were managed successfully with endoscopic papillotomy and extraction of pancreatic calculi from the ampulla. All patients had complete resolution of biliary obstruction with a single endoscopic procedure. Conclusion: Pancreatic calculus causing ampullary obstruction though very rare should be considered as a possibility in patients with chronic calcific pancreatitis presenting with biliary obstruction. Endoscopic therapy is effective in extraction of pancreatic calculi impacted in ampulla and resolution of biliary obstruction.Effects of vitamin D deficiency in patients with acute pancreatitisDeepak K Bhasin, Chalapathi Rao, Surinder S Rana, Ravi Kumar Sharma , Vishal Sharma, Naresh Sachdeva, Anil Bhansali Departments of Gastroenterology, and Endocrinology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160 012, IndiaBackground: The association between hypovitaminosis D and acute pancreatitis (AP) has not been studied. Aim: Study incidence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with AP and assess the correlation, if any, between hypovitaminosis D and severity, complications and its outcome. Methods: Ninety-four patients (56M; age 38\u00b113.34 years) with AP who were admitted between January 2011 and October 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical, laboratory, radiological parameters, need for intervention and final outcome were retrieved. Results: The most common etiology of AP was alcohol intake (n=39; 41.4 %) followed by gallstone disease (n=32; 34 %). %) patients had necrotizing pancreatitis. Persistent organ failure was noted in 48 (51 %) patients of which respiratory failure was the most common (n=39; 41.5 %). Mean CTSI was 6.65\u00b12.70 and 7 (7.4 %) patients succumbed to their illness. The mean vitamin D levels in the patients studied were 21.4\u00b123.7 ng/mL. The mean corrected calcium and phosphate levels were 7.7\u00b172 mg/dL and 3.0\u00b11.49 mg/dL. Seventy-three (77.7 %) patients were found to be vitamin D deficient (vitamin D levels <30 ng/mL). Persistent organ failure was seen more commonly in patients with vitamin D deficiency compared to patients with normal levels (56.2 % vs. 33.3 %; p=0.04. However, compared to deficient group, those with normal levels had Patients of AP with vitamin D deficiency have increased incidence of persistent organ failure.EUS study of fluid collections in acute necrotizing pancreatitis: Are they pseudocysts, walled off pancreatic necrosis or need a new name? Surinder S Rana, Deepak K Bhasin, Yalaka Rami Reddy, Chalapathi Rao, Ravi K Sharma, K Jeyashree, Rajesh Gupta Department of Gastroenterology, School of Public Health and Surgery, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Sector 12, Chandigarh 160 012, IndiaBackground: There have been attempts to develop universally applicable nomenclature for pancreatic fluid collections (PFC's) in acute pancreatitis. But PFC's following acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) has not been studied by sensitive imaging techniques like EUS. Aims: Prospectively study PFC's occurring following ANP by serial endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Patients: Over last 14 months, 47 patients (34 males; mean age 36.7\u00b111.6 years) of ANP with PFC were followed up with EUS at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months respectively. Results: On EUS at 6 weeks, 41/47 (87 %) patients had fluid collection with solid debris. Follow up EUS at 3 and 6 months revealed progressively decreasing solid content (52 % and 44 % patients had solid content respectively). During this period, 11 (23.4 %) patients needed intervention for symptomatic PFC and two of these patients had no solid debris. Addition of retrospective data of endoscopic drainage of WOPN done over last 3 years identified 43 patients and 40 % solid debris was present in 6, 33 and 4 patients respectively. Patients with <10 % necrotic debris needed only single session of endoscopic drainage whereas patients with 10 % to 40 % solid debris needed 2 or more sessions. Patients with >40 % solid debris either needed direct endoscopic debridement or surgical necrosectomy. Conclusions: All PFC following ANP may not have solid necrotic content and over period of time necrotic content tends to liquefy. This may have therapeutic implications.Comparative study of combined EUS and ERCP with CT scan for evaluation of patients with suspected periampullary carcinoma and obstructive jaundice Mohd. Juned Khan, C Palanivelu, P S Rajan, P Kartikeyan, P Senthilnathan, B Tarannum G E M Hospital and Research Centre, 45, Pankaja Mill Road, Ramanathapuram, Coimbatore 641 045, IndiaObjective: (1) To determine feasibility and outcome of EUS and therapeutic ERCP into single session and compare with CT scan findings. (2) To determine inoperability of patients who were operable on CT scan. Material and Methods: >Total of 30 patients between age group of 40-75 years, with suspected malignant obstructing lesion in periampullary region. Combined EUS and ERCP was done by our team in single sitting. By using linear array endoscope with or without radial echoendoscope (Olympus) an EUS evaluation of ampulla, pancrease, bileduct and duodenum was done. Results: Out of 30 patients, CT scan of 22 showed mass with dilated IHBR and CBD and remaining 8 patients (26.66) showed only dilated IHBR and CBD on CT scan. EUS was done in these 22 cases. Out of these 22 EUS; 14 (63.6 %) cases are operable, while EUS of 8 (36.4 %) showed that patients are inoperable due to involvement of vessels and lymphnodes. CT scan of 8 patients showed only dilated IHBR and CBD. EUS study of these 8 patients showed that 3 (37.5 %) cases has early small mass in head of pancreas. Two patients were found to have stricture, one proved to be malignant and one proved to be benign on biopsy. Last one patient have small CBD stone and sludge in terminal CBD. Conclusion : 1. Combined EUS and ERCP done in same sitting is cost effective and time saving. 2. EUS is superior modality to CT scan abdomen in redeciding the operability of periampularry malignancyPrevailing factors and prognosis in post ERCP pancreatitis I Naresh Md, P Muralikrishna, K Jayaram, L R S Girinadh Department of Gastroenterology, Andhra Medical College, King George Hospital, Vishakhapatnam, India Introduction: Acute pancreatitis is the most common and serious complication of ERCP procedure. Serum amylase elevation is common after ERCP, seen up to 75 % of the patients. Fortunately, acute pancreatitis requiring hospitalization is less common. Aim of the Study: 1.To estimate the frequency, severity and outcome of post ERCP pancreatitis. 2. To identify the risk factors associated with post ERCP pancreatitis. 3. To predict the onset of post ERCP pancreatitis. Materials and Methods: Patients undergoing ERCP in Endoscopy Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, King George Hospital, Vishakhapatnam, during the period from January 2011 to February 2013 were included in the study. Serum amylase estimation was done with in 4 hours after ERCP. In patients with elevated serum amylase at 4 hours post ERCP, repeat serum amylase estimation was done at 24 hours after ERCP. Results: 1. Overall incidence of post ERCP pancreatitis is about 8.7 % (16 of 198). Asymptomatic hyperamylesemia is about 42.4 %. 2. On univariate analysis patient related factors like age 24.9 kg/m2 are found to be significant. 3. Procedure related factors like involvement of trainee/junior consultant and difficult cannulation are found to be associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis. Conclusions: 1.The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is about 8.7 %. Asymptomatic rise in serum amylase is about 42.2 % in our study. 2. Post-ERCP pancreatitis runs a benign course and has good outcome. 3. The level of serum amylase measured at 4 hours after ERCP is the most reliable predictor of post-ERCP pancreatitis.Hemorrhage complicating the course of severe acute pancreatitis R V Pradeep Krishna, Vikas Gupta, Yadav, D Thakur, Bhalla, Asheesh; J D Wig, Rakesh Kochhar Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160 012, IndiaIntroduction: The course of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) can be complicated by hemorrhage, which is associated with poor outcome. Objectives: To evaluate the factors associated with hemorrhagic complications in SAP and their effect on outcome. Results: Twenty-four (13.1 %) patients had hemorrhagic complications; 12 intraabdominal and 12 intraluminal. Thirteen had a major and 11 had minor bleed. Sixteen patients bleed before and 8 after intervention (radiological 3, surgical 5). The mean duration of pancreatitis prior to bleed was 27+27.2 days. Predictors of bleed on univariate analysis were male sex (p= 0.014), organ failure (p=0.008), venous thrombosis (p=0.033), infective necrosis (0.001) and systemic sepsis (0.037). On multivariate analysis infected necrosis (p =0.015) was a significant factor. Radiological drainage was associated with decreased risk of bleeding (45.8 % vs. 54.4 %; p=0.000). Need for surgery (50 % vs. 12.6 %, p=0.003), intensive care stay (7.4+7.9 vs. 5.4+5.2 days; p=0.001) and mortality (41.7 % vs. 10.7 %; p=0.000) were significantly higher in bleeders. 7/13 of major bleeders had pseudoaneurysms -4 were embolized, 4 needed surgery including 1 embolization failure. 7/12 intraabdominal bleeders required surgical intervention, 3 had successful embolization and 2 had expectant management. Of the 12 with luminal bleed, 8 had gastroduodenal ulcers and 4 had evidence of hollow viscus erosion, all of which required surgery. CT severity index (p=0.046) and surgical intervention (p= 0.041), were significantly associated with intraabdominal bleed. Organ failure (p=0.043), presence of pseudoaneurysm (53.8 % vs. 9.1 %; p=0.041) and surgical intervention (69.2 % vs. 27.3 %; p=0.020) were associated with major bleed. No significant factor could be identified for post-intervention bleed. Conclusions: Hemorrhage in SAP indicates severe disease. Infection causes local events which predispose to hemorrhage. Luminal bleed may be indicative of erosion into the adjacent viscera. Pseudoaneurysms were associated with major bleeding. Bleeding occurring after intervention have similar course as those without. Endoscopic drainage is effective and safe for pancreatic pseudocysts in the setting of acute pancreatitis.Pancreas divisum in Lucknow: Clinical presentation and long-term results of endoscopic therapyVivek A Saraswat, Praveer Rai, Samir Mohindra, Sachin Munjal, Manoharlal Sharma Department of Gastroenterology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow 226 014, India Aim: To evaluate clinical presentation and long-term results of endoscopic therapy in patients with pancreas divisum. Patients and Methods : Database of patients undergoing endotherapy for pancreas divisum from January 2002 to July 2013 was analyzed for clinical presentation and results of therapy. Technical success was completion of minor papilla endotherapy while clinical success was resolution of symptoms with unhindered pancreatic drainage after endotherapy. Patients with CP were treated with clearance of PD calculi, dilatation and stenting of strictures in the dorsal duct and repeated stent exchanges till resolution of strictures. Results: Forty-three procedures were done in 21 patients with pancreas divisum [mean age 24 years (8 to 54), 12 male] presenting with recurrent pain for 47 months (6 to 274). Recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) was present in 5 while 16 had chronic pancreatitis (CP; 10 calcific, 6 non-calcific). Minor papilla sphincterotomy with PD stent (4) provided pain relief in RAP for clinical success of 100 %. Technical success was 90.5 %; minor papilla canulation failed in 2 patients with CP, who underwent surgery. Dorsal duct CP was treated with dilatation and stenting (8) or by dilatation alone (6). Pain was relieved completely in 10, persisted in 1, while 3 are still on treatment. Mean duration of follow up after endotherapy was 17.6 months. Clinical success was achieved in 77 % (10/13) completing therapy. Complications occurred in 5 patients (20 %; mild pancreatitis 4, stent migration 1). Conclusion: Endoscopic therapy was successful in patients with pancreas divisum, providing long-lasting relief in both CP and RAP.Cysto enteric fistula of pancreatic pseudocyst S John , Kani Sheik, Rathnakar Kini, Premkumar, Pugazhendhi, Mohammed Ali Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Madras Medical College, Chennai 600 003, India", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF68": {"text": "Namrata Singh , Vikas Sachdev, Indu Arora, Ashish Datt Upadhyay, Anoop Saraya. Departments of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition, and Biostatistics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110 029, IndiaAim : To see the association between pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and clinical parameters in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Methods: Fecal elastase, fecal fat and fecal chymotrypsin were measured in patients with CP. Association of these three parameters with pain, steatorhea, diabetes, disease duration, BMI and USG findings (Atrophy, ductal dilatation and calcification) were examined. Results: Out of 153 patients (mean age 33.26\u00b112 years, males 118), 140 presented with pain. Diabetes and steatorhea was present in 21 % and 32.03 %, respectively. Fecal elastase gm) in 53 (34.64 %) patients. Diabetes was more prevalent in CP patients with high fecal fat (p =0.001) and low chymotrypsin (p =0.001) levels. Duration of disease had no effect on the three studied parameters. Three methods did not correlate with ductal dilatation, pancreatic atrophy and calcification. Chymotrypsin levels had a positive correlation with elastase (r=0.6238, p <0.001) and BMI (r=0.2047, p =0.0200). Fecal fat had a weak negative correlation with elastase (r=-0.2538, p =0.0032) and chymotrypsin (r=-0.2058, p =0.0175). Conclusion: Fecal chymotrypsin levels correlated with fecal fat excretion and BMI. Fecal chymotrypsin estimation may be helpful in early detection of malabsorption in chronic pancreatitis.Tumor necrosis factor alpha gene polymorphisms and hospital outcomes in patients with acute pancreatitis V A Jiffy Rasak, Ebby George Simon, S Pugazhendhi, B S Ramakrishna Department of Gastroenterolgy, Wellcome Research Laboratory, Christian Medical College, Vellore 632 004, India Background: Acute pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas which can be precipitated by multiple factors. The severity of illness can range from mild to life threatening. We hypothesized that the polymorphisms in TNF alpha can affect the severity of illness once a patient develops pancreatitis. Aims: 1. To study the clinical profile of patients presenting with acute pancreatitis. 2. To study the effect of TNF alpha gene polymorphisms on the outcome of pancreatitis and severity of illness. Methods: All patients presenting with acute pancreatitis to CMC were recruited. Their clinical and laboratory profiles were studied and the in-hospital outcomes and severity of illness were assessed. Venous blood was collected from all patients for DNA analysis. The polymorphisms being studied were TNF 308 G/A, TNF 857 C/T, TNF 863C. Results: One hundred and ten patients have been recruited for the study till date -93 males and 17 females. Eighty-eight patients presented with the first episode whereas 22 had recurrent attacks. Alcohol was the commonest etiology. Fifty-one patients had mild attack and 59 of them had a severe attack. Eleven patients required ICU admission and there were seven deaths. The most common complication requiring ICU admission was ARDS/ALI. The genetic analysis of these patients is under way.Conclusion: More than 50 % of the patients in our study had severe acute pancreatitis. We expect to find a positive correlation to the severity of illness and the TNF polymorphisms.Evaluation of hydrogen sulfide as a prognostic marker in patients with acute pancreatitisIqbal N Qureshi , A J Joseph, Kavitha Reuben, K A Balasubramanian, Anup Ramachandran Department of Gastrointestinal Sciences, Christian Medical College, Vellore 632 004, IndiaBackground: Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a vasoactive molecule with varied function. The study was aimed to evaluate the role of H2S in acute pancreatitis. Materials and Methods: All patients of acute pancreatitis admitted between June 2012 and May 2013 were included in the study. Severity of acute pancreatitis was defined as per Atlanta classification. Plasma H2S was measured (spectrophotometry) at admission, at 48 hours and at discharge. H2S was also measured in 13 healthy volunteers. Results : Thirty-eight patients (male:30; age: 39.5, 13-72 years; median, range) were included. Alcohol (18) and biliary (9) were common etiology of pancreatitis. Eleven (29 %) had severe pancreatitis; 10 had acute lung injury and 2 had acute kidney injury. Admission plasma H2S levels in patients with acute pancreatitis (n =34) was similar to those of healthy volunteers (16.4, 7-81 \u03bcmol/L vs. 16.4, 11-26 \u03bcmol/L; median, range; p -value: 0.8). Admission plasma H2S levels in patients with mild pancreatitis (n=24) was similar to patients with severe pancreatitis (15.7, 7-81 \u03bcmol/L vs. 36, 10-54 \u03bcmol/L; p-value: 0.5). Plasma H2S levels at 48 hours after admission (n=34; 15, 3.6-76 \u03bcmol/L vs. 22, 10-59 \u03bcmol/L; pvalue: 0.6) and at discharge (n=23) was also similar in patients with mild and severe pancreatitis. Admission plasma H2S levels did not predict acute lung injury in the study patients. Plasma H2S levels at admission in the single patient who expired of multi-organ failure was 10 \u03bcmol/L. Conclusion: Plasma H2S levels at admission or at 48 hours after do not predict severity in patients with acute pancreatitis.Utility of the \"Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score\" in predicting a non-severe course of acute pancreatitis: A pilot study in an Indian cohort Rupjyoti Talukdar, Mithun Sharma, Amal Dev Goswami, Arunima Goswami, Anup Baro Introduction: Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score (HAPS) is a newly developed system that predicts a mild course of AP. HAPS includes absence of rebound abdominal tenderness, normal hematocrit and serum creatinine <0.0001). Significantly higher proportions (%, p) of non-HAPS patients need-HAPS can be useful in severity assessment of AP in Indian patients.An interesting case of trichobezoar M G Manoj, Azimudin, Ramesh Kumar, Sathiamoorthy, Venketeswaran, Revathy, Chitra, Manimaran, Murali, Malarvizhi Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Government Stanley Hospital and Medical College, Chennai 600 001, India", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF69": {"text": "Vibhor Vinayak Borkar, U Poddar, A Kapoor, S K Yachha, A Srivastava Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow 226 014, India Background/Aim : Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) has not so far been reported to occur among children with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO). We have prospectively studied the prevalence of HPS in children with portal hypertension. Methods: Over a period of 18 months, children with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis and EHPVO between ages 1-18 years were studied and prevalence of HPS was compared in each group. HPS was diagnosed by the presence intrapulmonary shunt using transthorasic contrast echocardiography and hypoxia/orthodeoxia (in ABG). Result : Of 121 children (35 cirrhotics and 86 EHPVO) studied, HPS was significantly more in children with cirrhosis than with EHPVO (37 %) vs. 14 %, p=0.007]. Both the groups were comparable as per gender distribution (Male: 74 % vs. 84 %) and age (10.8 \u00b13.7 vs. 10.9\u00b13.9 years). Cirrhotics with HPS had increased frequency of clinical features (clubbing, dyspnea, cyanosis) and long standing disease duration (44\u00b138 vs. 20\u00b122 months, p =0.01) as compared to cirrhotics without HPS. Proportion of advanced liver disease (Child B and C) was similar in both the groups (70 % vs. 72 %). Among the EHPVO, clubbing was observed in children with HPS only (33 % vs. 3 %, p=0.003). There were no difference between children with HPS and without in terms of their gender, age, spleen size and hypersplenism.Conclusions: This study shows occurrence of HPS among children with EHPVO and it occurs less often as compared to cirrhotic children. Long standing duration of disease with cirrhotics is more common with HPS.Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia: A rare cause of chronic diarrhea in children K S Prasanth, S Anil Kumar, A B Suthanu, Tony Joseph, N Premaletha, A Santhosh Kumar, K R Vinaya Kumar Departments of Gastroenterology and Pediatrics, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram 695 011, India", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF70": {"text": "A 15-year experience V A Saraswat, R Malik, P Rai, S K Yachha Departments of Gastroenterology and Pediatric Gastroenterology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow 226 014, India surgical referral after initial ERCP (unsuitability for endoscopic therapy 2, technical failure 3).

Methods: Prospective single blind randomized trial conducted in a tertiary care setting. Patients were randomized to receive any of the three bowel preparation regimens; (A) split dose sulphate solution or (B) split dose PEG solution or (C) same day single dose PEG solution. Efficacy of bowel cleansing was assessed by Boston Bowel Preparation Score (BBPS). Any adverse effects were noted. Results: A total of 172 patients were considered for the study (A-56, B-61, C-55). Baseline variables were comparable across the groups. The mean BBPS scores amongst groups A, B and C were 8.02, 7.47 and 8.24 respectively (p=0.041). Bonferroni analysis revealed no significant difference between group A vs. groups B and C, where as the difference was significant between groups B and C; C with higher BBPS scores. Severe taste intolerance was reported in 41.1 % (n=23) of patients in group A compared to 19.7 % (n=12) and 7.3 % (n=4) amongst group B and C. Volume intolerance was seen in 14.6 % (n=6), 23 % (n=14), 38.2 % (n=21) in groups A, B and C respectively. Sleep disturbance was observed in groups A (14.3 %) and B (27.9 %). Conclusions : All preparations provided satisfactory bowel cleansing. Same day single dose PEG provided superior bowel cleansing compared to split PEG regimen. Sulphate preparation was associated with more taste intolerance while single dose PEG was associated with more volume intolerance. Sleep disturbances were a problem for overnight bowel preparations.Spectrum of gastrointestinal foreign bodiesG Balaji, Muthukumar, G R M Kumar, R Balamurali, P Ganesh, S jeevankumars Department of Gastroenterology, Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, Chennai 600 010, IndiaIntroduction : Gastrointestinal foreign bodies (GIFBs) are comprised of food bolus impactions and intentionally and unintentionally ingested or inserted foreign objects. Most resolve without serious clinical sequelae. Regardless of imprecise morbidity and mortality rates, serious complications and deaths occur as a consequence of foreign body ingestions. It is important to understand which patients are at risk for GIFBs, know how to diagnose and treat GIFBs, and deal with their complications.

Introduction: Acute upper GI bleeding is a common medical emergency with a hospital mortality of approximately 10 %. Higher mortality rate is associated with rebleeding. Rockall scoring system identifies patients at higher risk of rebleed and mortality.Methods: This is a prospective, descriptive hospital based study conducted in Gastroenterology Unit of College of Medical Sciences and Teaching Hospital, Bharatpur, Nepal from January 2012 to January 2013. It included 120 patients at random presenting with manifestations of acute UGI bleed. Rockall scoring system was used to predict the prognosis and rebleeding by dividing the patients into two groups ie. Group I with Rockall score 6. Results: Males were predominant (75 %). Age ranged from 14 to 88 years, mean being 48.76+17.19. At presentation shock was detected in 21.7 %, severe anemia and high blood urea were found in 34.2 % and 38.3 % respectively. UGI endoscopy revealed esophageal varices (47.5 %), peptic ulcer disease (33.3 %), erosive mucosal disease (11.6 %), Mallory-Weiss tear (4.1 %) and malignancy (3.3 %). Median hospital stay was 7.28+ 3.18 days. Comorbidities were present in 43.3 %. Eighty-six patients (71.7 %) had Rockall score <5 and 34 (28.3 %) had >6. Five patients (4.2 %) expired. Risk factors for death being massive rebleeeding, comorbidities and Rockall score >7. Conclusion: Mortality is associated with massive bleeding, comorbidities and Rockall score >7. Rockall scoring system is an effective system for predicting outcome in patients with upper GI bleeding. Background and Aims: The incidence and severity of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in pregnant women is high in developing countries. Transplacental transmission of HEV in the third trimester of pregnancy has been found to be associated with a high fetal mortality. In humans, extrahepatic site(s) for HEV replication has not been reported to date, therefore this study was carried out to investigate if HEV replication occurs in the placenta of the infected mothers. Methods: The study group included 68 acute viral hepatitis (AVH) and 22 acute liver failure (ALF) pregnant patients. Viral RNA was extracted from blood and placenta. HEV replication in placenta was confirmed by a replicative negative strand-specific rt-PCR. Viral load was estimated by real time PCR. Immunohistochemical studies using HEV antibody and electron microscopy (Tecnai G2, TEM) were also carried out for in situ detection of HEV in representative placental tissue sections. Results: Replicative HEV RNA was detectable only in the placenta and not in the blood of the study group. Positive staining of placental tissue sections stained with hepatitis E virus antibody against the viral structural protein ORF3 was identified in all the representative cases. Hepatitis E virus particles were also observed by electron microscopy in placental tissue samples. HEV replication in placenta correlated with fetal and maternal mortality in ALF. Conclusion: The extrahepatic replication of hepatitis E virus in human placenta is demonstrated for the first time by three methods. HEV replication in placenta is associated with the severity of disease in HEV infected pregnant women.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Endoscopic correlation of radiologic f indings in the gastrointestinal tract Krishnadas Devadas, Anish Philip, Mukunda Madhavan, Vinu P A Joseph, R Sobhanadevi Department of Gastroenterology Government Medical College, Kottayam 686 008, India Background and Aims: Patients often come with radiological reports of bowel wall thickening on ultrasounds (USS) and CT scans done for even nonbowel related complaints. This results in invasive procedures like upper and lower GI endoscopies. We tried to look at the correlation between radiologic investigations and endoscopic findings and to see if presence of symptoms and signs could predict positive endoscopy.

Needle-knife papillotomy (NKP) is the technique used in ERCP to facilitate access to CBD or PD when standard cannulation techniques have failed. Our aim was to examine the safety and efficacy of NKP to obtain selective cannulation of the CBD. Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively kept data from January 2007 to June 2012. We assessed the safety and efficacy of NKP in 1,082 consecutive patients in whom attempts at standard common bile duct cannulation were unsuccessful. The data was obtained from complication register and ERCP report books. Results: From January 2007 to July 2012, 1,082 (9.7 %) NKP were performed out of a total of 11,062 ERCP procedures. Of these 768 (70.9 %) were females and 470 (40.7 %) were in age group of 41-60 years. The indication for NKP was failed CBD cannulation in all except in patients with periampullary divericula (n =36; 3.3 %) and ectopic papilla (n =43; 3.9 %). Post NKP, CBD could be cannulated immediately in 765 (71 %) patients, 187 patients required second ERCP making total cannulation rate following NKP of 91 % (n =982). Post-NKP complications occurred in 7.9 % (n =86) as compared to 4.1 % (n =454) post-ERCP (without NKP). Conclusions: NKP is effective in facilitating cannulation in patients with failed standard ERCP. The overall success rate was 91 % and it was associated with non-significant increase in complication rate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-9"}, {"text": "Impact of completion of primary biliary procedure on management of post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic perforation S Srivastava, A Jindal, L Jain, P K Mishra, S Puri, S Sachdeva, N Gupta, B C Sharma, A S Puri Departments of Gastroenterology, GI Surgery, and Radiology, G B Pant Hospital, J L Nehru Marg, New Delhi 110 002, IndiaBackground: Perforation is one of the most dreaded complications of therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Retroduodenal perforation was reported in 0.5 to 2.1 percent of sphincterotomies in a number of large series. We planned to study incidence and epidemiology of post-ERCP perforation and risk factors for post-ERCP perforation. Methods: From January 2007 to April 2012, 11,500 ERCPs were performed. Data was collected from complication register and ERCP report books maintained in department by 2 investigators independently. Case sheets of 171 (1.4 %) patients diagnosed as post-ERCP perforation with radiologic, endoscopic or surgical evidence were retrospectively reviewed. We analyzed epidemiology of perforation and risk factors associated with poor outcomes. Results: 60.8 % (n=7000) of all patients undergoing ERCPs were females. One hundred thirty-nine (81.3 %) were females amongst patients who had post-ERCP perforation. Therapeutic ERCP was performed in all. Mean hospital stay was 14\u00b16 days. Majority 129 (75.4 %) were related to use of needle knife precut. Female gender (1.9 % vs. 0.7 %, p<0.001), age >40 years (1.7 % vs. 1.1 %, p<0.01), benign disease (1.7 % vs. 1.1 % p<0.01) were independent risk factors for post-ERCP perforation. Most of the perforations (n =135, 79 %) were detected on table. Majority of patients were managed conservatively (n =164, 96 %). Although 159 patients recovered without poor outcomes, there was mortality in 13 patients (7 %). Of the 13 deaths, 8 patients died of ongoing cholangitis while only 5 died as a complication arising out of perforation. Completion of biliary procedure for primary disease was associated with low risk of mortality (2 % vs. 15.4 %, p<0.001). Conclusions: Post-ERCP perforation is uncommon, majority of patients can be managed conservatively. Mortality is rare and completion of biliary procedure for primary disease lowers the mortality significantly.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-10"}, {"text": "Corrosive injury-Tertiary care centre experience", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "M-11"}, {"text": "Madras Medical College, Chennai 600 003, India", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A Sangameswaran"}]}
