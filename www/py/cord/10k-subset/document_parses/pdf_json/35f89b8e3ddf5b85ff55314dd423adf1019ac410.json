Using an unbiased search, we analyzed the epigenetic changes at DNA methylation and post-translational histone modification levels induced by the infection. DNA methylation was unaltered, while we found a general decrease on histone acetylation, which correlates with transcriptional inactivation and may cooperate with the impairment of cellular transcription that causes influenza virus infection. A particular increase in H3K79 methylation was observed and the use of an inhibitor of the specific H3K79 methylase, Dot1L enzyme, or its silencing, increased influenza virus replication. The antiviral response was reduced in conditions of Dot1L downregulation, since decreased nuclear translocation of NF-kB complex, and IFN-\u03b2, Mx1 and ISG56 expression was detected. The data suggested a control of antiviral signaling by methylation of H3K79 and consequently, influenza virus replication was unaffected in IFN pathway-compromised, Dot1L-inhibited cells. H3K79 methylation also controlled replication of another potent interferoninducing virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus, but did not modify amplification of respiratory syncytial virus that poorly induces interferon signaling. Epigenetic methylation of H3K79 might have an important role in controlling interferon-induced signaling against viral pathogens.",

Epigenetic modifications of chromatin regulate heritable and reversible gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, and can also modify chromatin accessibility. DNA methylation and post-translational histone acetylation and methylation are major mechanisms responsible for epigenetic regulation of gene expression 1 . DNA methylation typically represses gene transcription when takes place in the promoters of regulated genes 2 . Histone acetylation opens the condensed chromatin structure by reducing DNA affinity for histones; this enables the DNA to uncoil from nucleosomes so that transcription factors and RNA polymerase can access the DNA and increase transcription 3 . Histone methylation can increase or decrease gene transcription, depending on which amino acids in the histones are modified and how many methyl groups are added to specific residues 4 .",

At 8 h post infection (hpi), DNA was isolated and methylation profiles evaluated in triplicate using the 450 K Infinium DNA Methylation BeadChip. Correlation analysis of the 444,751 valid probes showed an extremely strong relationship between samples (Pearson correlation coefficient from R2 = 0.9945 to R2 = 0.9960; Fig. 1B ). To identify specific differentially methylated candidates, we performed a parametric analysis to compare average beta values from infected with mock-infected cells, selecting those with differences in methylation levels >25 (\u22120.25>delta>0.25) and a standard deviation value <10% (Desvest<0.10). We found no significant variations, even after analysis of selected CpG sites from infection-associated genes (not shown), which indicated that global methylation of DNA does not change during influenza virus infection in this system.",

We used unbiased analysis with the nanoLC-MS platform to identify and quantify influenza virus-induced epigenetic changes in histone post-translational modifications (PTM). Three biological replicates were analyzed and quantitative analyses completed (see Methods). We considered a Mascot score threshold of 25 as high-confidence peptide identifications, and all peptides methylated/acetylated on lysine (above or below this threshold) were validated manually to assure correct tandem mass spectra matches. Only PTMs that were present in at least two replicas are presented (Fig. 1C) and it has to be pointed out that all modified and unmodified peptides were identified reliably more than once. Results in infected cells showed a reduction in lysine acetylation of histone 3 and 4. This decrease would impair host cell expression, in accordance with the role of acetylation in opening the condensed chromatin and activating transcription 17 . Non-methylated H3K36 and non-acetylated H4K79 levels increased moderately during infection; since H3K36 methylation and H4K79 acetylation are hallmarks of transcription elongation 18, 19 , the increased levels of these unmodified residues would also contribute to transcriptional inactivation of host cells.",

Lysines not detected by MS include H3K4 and H4K20, whose PTM are recognized as histone marks that control cell transcription. H3K4 trimethylation is a common modification in active chromatin 20 , whereas H4K20 methylation is linked to transcriptional repression 20, 21 . Decreased H3K4me3 levels have been observed during influenza virus infection 16 ; here we evaluated possible changes in methylated H4K20 and in acetylated H4K16, as the latter is a conventional histone marker of active chromatin 22 . Total extracts of A549 mock-infected or PR8hv-infected cells at high m.o.i. were collected at various times post-infection and levels of acetylated H4K16 and dimethylated H4K20 were tested by Western blot. The results indicated that at late times after infection, influenza virus triggers a decrease in H4K16ac and an increase in H4K20me2 (Fig. 1D ), which could contribute to a general decrease in host cell transcription activity.",

As methylation of this lysine gave the highest score in MS analysis, we evaluated this increase by two additional methods. We purified histones from cells mock-or PR8hv-infected at high m.o.i.; at 8 hpi, H3K79me2 levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1E ) and a quantitative colorimetric method based on anti-H3K79me2 antibody detection (Epigentek) (Fig. 1F ).

We also evaluated the expression of viral and ISG proteins (ISG56 and MxA) during infection with RSV (Fig. 8B, right) , and VSV (Fig. 8D, right) . The corresponding viral proteins were detected and we observed a lack of IFN-stimulated gene induction in RSV-infected cells, while infection with VSV efficiently induced IFN response in our system.

Consequently, during infection there is a network of viral-and host-induced modifications of cellular gene expression with a close dependence of chromatin-based functions and therefore of chromatin dynamic. Accordingly, specific interactions between chromatin remodelers of the CHD family and influenza virus proteins have been described such as the association of CHD3 with the non-structural protein NS2 37 or CHD6 and CHD1 with the viral polymerase complex 16, 38, 39 .

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and antibodies that recognize canonical marks of transcription activation such as H3K4me3 or of inactivation such as H3K27me3 showed addition or removal of these PTM in several ISG; modifications depended on strain virulence when H5N1 virus was compared with the H1N1 2009 pandemic strain 8 . This study emphasized the importance of epigenetic control in the antiviral response elicited by influenza virus infection; nonetheless, they focused on the search for specific canonical transcription activation or repression marks of histones that correlate with up-or down-transcriptional regulation of the corresponding genes and do not provide an overview of all possible changes to chromatin in response to the viral infection. For a broad overview of chromatin modifications in influenza virus-infected cells, we used an unbiased search for global changes in chromatin epigenetics at the DNA and histone levels. We observed a general decrease on histone acetylation in H3 and H4 lysine residues after infection, as well as increased levels of unmodified H3K36, H4K79 and dimethylated H4K20 (Fig. 1C and D) . In addition, previous studies showed reduction of H3K4me3; one of the hallmark of active chromatin 16 . Histone acetylation has a key role opening the condensed chromatin, resulting in charge neutralization and a more relaxed, open, and transcriptionally active chromatin structure 17 . Decreased acetylated histones, trimethylated H3K4 and increased non-methylated H3K36 and dimethylated H3K20, all associate with transcriptional inactivation [18] [19] [20] [21] . These epigenetic changes would impair host cell expression, in accordance with the transcription inactivation of the host cell that occurs during infection 40 and constitutes one of the major mechanisms triggered by the virus to inactivate host transcription machinery and consequently to decrease the antiviral response.",

            "text": "The role of H3K79 methylation in viral infection, is poorly characterized. Infection of human primary fibroblasts with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), produces a marked increase in H3K79me2 levels and downregulation of Dot1L expression results in a decreased viral growth 43 . The genome of HCMV is a double-stranded DNA molecule that is maintained as episome during infection. The viral DNA lacks histones when encapsidated in the virion however, upon infection the viral genome is transported to the nucleus, where it becomes associated with host cell histones. It has been speculated that Dot1L directly mediates replication of the HCV genome, in agreement with the chromatinization of its DNA genome 44 . The function of H3K79 methylation modulating influenza virus replication, suggest a very different mechanism, since influenza virus is an RNA virus that does not integrate in the host chromatin and its genome lacks histones. In physiological conditions where antiviral signaling is induced, decreased H3K79 methylation clearly enhanced viral replication (Figs 2 and 3) . Moreover, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB (Figs 4 and 5) and accumulation of IFN\u03b2 and ISGs (ISG56 and Mx1) decreased in influenza virus-infected cells with Dot1L downregulated (Fig. 6) .",

During infection, double-stranded RNA molecules are produced, which are recognized by the RIG-I helicase 45 . After activation, RIG-I recruits various TNF receptor-associated factors, which trigger phosphorylation and activation of the I\u03ba\u03ba complex, leading to I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation to allow NF\u03baB nuclear translocation 46 . NF-\u03baB and IFN regulatory factor 3 direct expression of type I IFN, which promote transcription of a variety of genes that further limit viral replication 45, 47 . We observed a marked increase on replication of influenza virus and VSV, both potent inducers of IFN, in cells with low levels of methylated H3K79 (Figs 2, 3 and 8 ). This effect is lost when cells deficient on IFN signaling are infected with influenza virus (Fig. 7) .",
