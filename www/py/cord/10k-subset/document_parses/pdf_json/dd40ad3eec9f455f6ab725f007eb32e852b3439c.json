To date, not many studies have been reported on the identification of suitable reference genes in buffaloes. The present study was undertaken to determine the panel of suitable reference genes in heat-stressed buffalo mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Briefly, MEC culture from buffalo mammary gland was exposed to 42 \u2218 C for one hour and subsequently allowed to recover at 37 \u2218 C for different time intervals (from 30 m to 48 h). Three different algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper softwares, were used to evaluate the stability of 16 potential reference genes from different functional classes. Our data identified RPL4, EEF1A1, and RPS23 genes to be the most appropriate reference genes that could be utilized for normalization of qPCR data in heat-stressed buffalo MECs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The riverine buffaloes (bubalus bubalis) exhibit signs of great distress when exposed to direct solar radiations. This is generally attributed to their specific morphological, anatomical, and behavioural characteristics [1] . The effect of heat stress on mammary epithelial cell (MEC), the major cell type in lactating mammary gland, could be one of the prime factors responsible for lower milk production in animals. Understanding of expression profile of these cells from different livestock species during different physiological stages would provide molecular basis of heat stress specific transcriptomic response of mammary gland. Recently, few efforts [2, 3] have been made to unravel the transcriptional response of mammary gland to heat stress condition; still, the molecular mechanism of such responses are thought to be too complex to understand. qPCR is a common tool to determine the expression level of any target gene; for accurate quantification of expression level, there is a need to identify the appropriate reference genes under the particular experimental setup. Such approaches are helping a great deal to normalize the real time data for reliable interpretation of expression studies in different species [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In earlier studies, researchers have relied mostly on GAPDH, ACTB, and RS18 as suitable reference genes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

These reports suggested that expression levels of commonly used reference genes vary considerably between different tissues and experimental conditions. Such variations reported in different studies [10, 17, [19] [20] [21] [22] indicated that there cannot be set universal reference genes for all tissues or experimental conditions, and hence there is a need for identification of tissue specific stably expressed genes [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Environmental heat stress affects the mammary gland that results in low milk production or truncated milk production. Mammary epithelial cells (MECs) are responsible for converting most precursors into milk constituents and transporting them to the mammary lumen, the first line that gets affected by heat stress. As MEC ares the predominant cell types in lactating mammary gland, changes in their genes expression could provide an insight of the mammary gland mechanism.

But in the recent past, the expression of these reference genes has been shown to be affected by experimental condition [30, 38] . Several other studies have also shown variation in their transcription level [10, 17, [19] [20] [21] [22] making them unsuitable for transcriptional studies.

Overall, RPL4, EEF1A1, and RPS23 were selected to be the three most stable reference genes for normalization of gene expression data in heat-stressed buffalo MECs under in-vitro conditions. Vandesompele et al. [10] and Bower and Johnston [39] have also recommended the use of geometric average of the most stable reference genes for accurate normalization of qPCR data. As this is the first paper on testing the reference genes in heat-stressed buffalo MECs, our analyses were restricted to some of the well-known housekeeping genes reported in other livestock species. In conclusion, RPL4, EEF1A1, and RPS23 are the best reference genes for heat-stressed studies in buffalo MECs, and their geometric means would provide accurate normalization factor. For other experimental settings involving buffalo MECs, the use of these reference genes may be carefully evaluated as their expression may change in other specific experimental conditions. However, the panel reference genes identified in the present study would certainly be useful for accurate normalization of buffalo MECs expression data during heat challenge experiments.
