Cancer, chemotherapy, and radiation can all cause noninfectious pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory symptoms that can masquerade as a respiratory tract infection. Cancer patients are at a particular risk for infection by a wide variety of different viruses, fungi, and bacteria that can be difficult to treat. Although noninvasive diagnostics have significantly improved recently, patients with severe pneumonia and those not responding to usual therapy should be candidates for aggressive diagnostic testing and tissue sampling. Initial therapy should be carefully chosen and individually tailored to account for the individual patient's underlying risk factors for multi-drug-resistant pathogens, viral pathogens, or fungi. Once diagnostic testing returns, therapy should be altered to appropriately narrow the spectrum of coverage.",

Data regarding the incidence and epidemiology of respiratory tract infections in cancer patients are limited. In 2006, cancer was identified as the second leading cause of death in the United States (nearly 560,000 deaths), while influenza and pneumonia were listed at number 8 (comprising over 56,000 deaths) [1] . Mortality in the national vital statistics reports is listed as due to a single cause, while a substantial amount of mortality is due to the combination of cancer and pneumonia. Additionally, the fourth leading cause of death is chronic lower respiratory diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which overlaps with lung cancer and pneumonia. Of documented infections in patients with febrile neutropenia, 15-30 % are eventually documented to be pneumonia [2] . Thus, although a detailed understanding of the morbidity and mortality associated with pneumonia in patients with malignancy is limited, the burden is substantial. Respiratory tract infections are often divided into upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Upper respiratory tract infections primarily involve the nose, pharynx, and other adjacent structures. Lower respiratory tract infections are often defined as having evidence of infection, respiratory symptoms or physical examination findings suggesting lower respiratory tract disease, and abnormal chest imaging. Lower respiratory tract infections include bronchitis, bronchiolitis (e.g., in young children), and pneumonia.",

Lemierre's syndrome can also develop due to spread of infection from the perioral space into the soft tissues of the neck causing a septic thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein and septic emboli to the lungs.

In patients with more chronic disease, Staphylococcus aureus, enteric gram-negative bacteria, and anaerobes can also occur. In the setting of neutropenia or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), the possibility of invasive fungal sinusitis should be entertained and aggressively evaluated for if the patient develops symptoms potentially consistent with sinusitis. Rapid development of ocular findings, cranial nerve palsies, or mental status changes in the setting of sinusitis should prompt emergent sinus imaging and evaluation by an otolaryngologist for possible surgical debridement and biopsy. Failure to respond to usual empiric antibiotic therapy should also prompt additional imaging and possibly more invasive strategies to identify a pathogen and to evaluate for complications.",

            "text": "The differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates is broad and is outlined in Table 1 . Considerations include cardiac, pulmonary, malignant, inflammatory, and infectious processes. Notably, cardiac or pulmonary toxicity from comorbid medical conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or medications (e.g., amiodarone) can occur in the setting of cancer management. Cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and trastuzumab or mediastinal radiation should always be considered as a potential cause of cardiovascular dysfunction, which may present with primarily respiratory symptoms [15, 16] . Similarly, interstitial pneumonitis may result from treatment with bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine, cytarabine, fluorouracil, procarbazine, gefitinib, rituximab, and many other agents [15, 17, 18] . In addition, inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), such as sirolimus, everolimus, and temsirolimus, can cause a progressive noninfectious pneumonitis [19, 20] . Other complications of cancer treatment such as volume overload, acute lung injury after blood transfusion, pulmonary embolism, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage should also be considered. Primary lung cancer or metastatic disease can also result in pulmonary opacities. Sometimes, malignancies, particularly primary lung cancer, can obstruct or impede air flow into or out of the lung, resulting in a post-obstructive pneumonia or a lung abscess. Radiation pneumonitis, particularly if associated with fever and an elevation in white blood cell count [21] , is often difficult to distinguish from an infectious pneumonitis [22] . The infiltrates with radiation pneumonitis can have a perivascular haziness which can progress to patchy alveolar filling infiltrates [21] . In addition, multiple disease processes can simultaneously occur in the lungs, and this possibility should be entertained.",

            "text": "Certain epidemiological risk factors exist for pneumonia, and ascertainment of such factors in an individual patient can be helpful in expanding or altering the differential diagnosis. A history of cigarette smoking has been identified as the strongest epidemiological risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease in immunocompetent, nonelderly adults [23] . The season of the year should be considered as many respiratory viral infections occur predominantly in the winter and spring (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus). Children, particularly those in daycare, may transmit respiratory viruses such as RSV and influenza which are risk factors for invasive pneumococcal disease [23] . Sick contacts also may be a source for less commonly observed infections such as tuberculosis or measles. A history of exposure to tuberculosis is important since it may remain in a latent state for years before reactivating with increasing age or immune depletion. It is very important to consider that approximately 60 % of tuberculosis cases diagnosed in the United States occur in individuals who were born outside the United States [24] . Geographic factors are also helpful in considering endemic fungi such as histoplasmosis (the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys) and coccidioidomycosis (desert southwest, particularly the San Joaquin valley) which are more frequently observed in cancer patients. Although blastomycosis is frequently mistaken for lung cancer or a metastatic malignancy, symptomatic disease is uncommon in those with cancer but may occur more frequently in those with defects in cellmediated immunity [25] . Exposure to certain pets such as parakeets or parrots (a cause of psittacosis) or other animals such as birthing livestock (resulting in risk of infection with Coxiella burnetti or Q-fever) can suggest other uncommon causes of pneumonia. Ongoing construction at a medical center without appropriate protective measures or exposure to aerosolized soil can result in an increased risk of Aspergillus pneumonia [26] . These and other nosocomial risk factors for Aspergillus and also for Legionella infections are outlined elsewhere in this volume (Chapter Infection Control and Prevention Considerations). Recent history of a preceding or current viral illness should be obtained. It has been known that coinfections or mixed infections can be identified in communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) [12, 27] . Improved diagnostic testing, particularly the recent application of PCR testing for respiratory viral pathogens, has resulted in a greater appreciation for the interaction that can occur between bacterial and viral pathogens. In previously healthy children and adults who are admitted with pneumonia, 5-30 % have both viruses and bacteria identified using molecular techniques [10, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Additionally, viruses (e.g., influenza, RSV, and human metapneumovirus) have an important role in predisposing patients to invasive bacterial pneumonia. In a case-controlled study, prior influenza infection, 1-4 weeks before, predisposed children to subsequent severe pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization with an odds ratio of 12.4 [34] . Influenza infection is also a risk factor for severe S. aureus pneumonia (particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus or MRSA) [35, 36] . A recent review of autopsies of patients who died during the 1918 influenza pandemic suggested that much of the mortality was actually due to bacterial superinfection [37] . Others have also identified S. pneumoniae more frequently in nasopharyngeal secretions in those with severe novel 2009 H1N1 disease than in those with mild cases [38] . Additional pediatric data suggest that invasive pneumococcal disease correlates with a preceding RSV infection (up to 4 weeks later) and with a preceding human metapneumovirus or influenza infection (up to 2 weeks later) [38] . It should be noted that pneumococcal vaccination of children has been associated with a decrease in lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and human metapneumovirus [39, 40] . Thus, although data are lacking specifically in the cancer patient population, recent data suggest that viruses may predispose to subsequent bacterial infection and that bacteria and viruses are commonly coidentified in pneumonia.",

In addition to the specific tumor, the stage of the malignancy can also be helpful in suggesting potential oncology-related risk factors. For example, a patient with known brain metastases is at a higher risk of aspiration pneumonia than a patient without metastatic disease. Other risk factors for aspiration include impaired swallowing (especially with head and neck cancer), altered mental status, and procedures requiring sedation [41, 42] .",

First, immune deficits can occur from the underlying hematological malignancy (e.g., multiple myeloma) which can result in a deficit in humoral immunity which increases the risk of encapsulated organisms S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Second, strategies used to diagnose or treat the underlying malignancy can also increase the risk of pneumonia due to certain pathogens. For example, although uncommonly performed, splenectomy is strongly associated with an increased risk of infection with encapsulated organisms. Prolonged administration of steroids can increase the risk of invasive fungal pathogens and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). Administration of antilymphocyte antibodies can result in severe depletion of CD4 cells, placing patients at risk of cell-mediated infections and reactivation of latent infections. It is increasingly being recognized that delayed lymphocyte reconstitution (perhaps as a marker of delayed reconstitution of certain lymphocyte populations) can significantly impact recovery from certain viral infections such as adenovirus [43] . The depth and duration of neutropenia that occurs during chemotherapy directly increases the risk of bacterial and fungal infections-Aspergillus most notably. Finally, the impairment of mucosal defenses due to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy can also increase the risk of invasive bacterial pathogens and impair mucous clearance from the respiratory tract, further increasing the risk of invasive respiratory tract infections.",

Despite these improvements, pneumonia frequently complicates SCT. The two most important factors impacting the risk of infection after transplantation are the presence or absence of GVHD and the time from transplantation [45] . Classically, during the pre-engraftment period (usually less than 2-6 weeks), bacterial infections, Candida, Aspergillus, and HSV are among the most common pathogens [45] . After engraftment until about 100 days from SCT, the impact of deficient cell-mediated immunity results in an increased risk of CMV, PCP, and Aspergillus infections [45] [46] [47] [48] . In the late phase (after about 100 days), reactivation of CMV and VZV, and infections with encapsulated bacteria (e.g., pneumococcus) are most common and the risk correlates with the severity of prior GVHD [45] . Additionally, development of invasive Aspergillus infections [6 months after transplantation has been associated with chronic GVHD and prior CMV disease [46] . Notably, the risk of serious illness from respiratory viruses remains elevated throughout transplantation [45] . There are also other important factors impacting the risk of infection after transplantation. Allogeneic SCT recipients are at a higher risk of infectious complications than are autologous SCT recipients [45] . It is uncommon for autologous SCT recipients to have infectious complications after 3 months, while allogeneic SCT recipients continue to have measurable humoral, cell-mediated, and reticuloendothelial system deficits [49, 50] . Receipt of HLA-mismatched or unrelated donor transplants are also independent risk factors for latent viral reactivation and invasive fungal disease [45, 48] . The impact of T-cell depletion with a monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody (alemtuzumab) upon subsequent risk of reactivation of latent infections such as CMV and development of new infections should not be underestimated [46, 47, 51, 52] . Prior CMV is a major risk factor for subsequent invasive fungal disease [46, 53, 54] . Other important risk factors for invasive aspergillosis after engraftment include GVHD, receipt of corticosteroids, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and respiratory virus infections [45, 46] . While hospitalized, patients remain at risk of nosocomial acquisition of respiratory viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and adenovirus, which have been known to cause large outbreaks in transplant centers [55] [56] [57] [58] . The seasonality of these viruses appears to closely approximate that of the healthy population [59] .",

Cancer patients are a heterogeneous group of individuals who may have pathogens that may closely resemble the organisms observed in patients with CAP [14] , hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [13] , or pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients [60] . For example, a prostate cancer patient on hormonal therapy or an outpatient with colon cancer on 5-fluorouracil with no prior bone marrow suppression is likely to have pathogens that mirror those of CAP. In contrast, a surgically complicated colon cancer patient requiring a prolonged stay in the surgical intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation will be predisposed to pathogens that are commonly observed in HAP. A SCT recipient who develops pneumonia while neutropenic can be infected by pathogens observed in immunosuppressed patients, but could have pathogens more like a patient with HAP if the pneumonia develops during hospitalization or even CAP if the patient is [1 year out from SCT with immune reconstitution with no underlying GVHD. As well, the organisms causing aspiration pneumonia should be considered in patients with cancer for whom either comorbid conditions or medication use places them at a heightened risk of aspiration (e.g., alterations in mental status, mucositis, narcotic, and benzodiazepine use). One recent study documented that 15 % of cancer patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) had multiple pathogens identified [2] . Thus, physicians caring for cancer patients with pneumonia should carefully consider potential pathogens. Of particular importance is the consideration of prior microbiological isolates identified in a patient and prior anti-infective therapy. Adherence to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis greatly decreases the risk of PCP. Other prophylactic regimens for PCP are generally not as effective and also lack the protection that TMP-SMX provides against some bacteria and Nocardia [45, 61] . Prior antibiotic administration with broad-spectrum agents places patients at risk of infection with a drug-resistant pathogen. For example, prior levofloxacin administration has been previously associated with acquisition of fluoroquinolone- Pseudomonas aeruginosa",

Since HSV can reactivate in up to 70 % of BMT recipients [68] , it is recommended that acyclovir prophylaxis be administered to all SCT recipients until engraftment occurs and mucositis resolves [49] . It is important to consider HSV as a potential pathogen of the lungs, particularly in patients with perioral lesions or mucositis. Although HSV can be identified from bronchial fluid by PCR, it is not routinely tested for by most molecular laboratories. Viral culture, rapid shell vial, and DFA tests all can easily identify HSV. Treatment is with high-dose acyclovir. Resistance to acyclovir can occur through mutations in the thymidine kinase gene and rarely through mutations in the HSV DNA polymerase [48] . Alternatives include the nephrotoxic medications foscarnet and cidofovir, although occasionally resistance to these can develop [69, 70] (See Chapter Antimicrobial Agents, Drug Adverse Reactions and Interactions, and Cancer).",

Consistently identified risk factors for CMV disease include CMV seropositivity, GVHD, lymphopenia, and use of alemtuzumab [47, [72] [73] [74] . CMV establishes latency; thus, isolation of CMV by viral culture from peripheral sites (e.g., nasopharyngeal, urine, and stool) is poorly predictive in identifying patients who will develop subsequent invasive CMV disease, and some patients who developed disease before peripheral cultures had enough time to grow [75, 76] . Although CMV pp65 antigen testing of blood resulted in more rapid identification, it was limited by the need for large blood volumes and could not be used in neutropenic patients [43] . The advent of PCR testing of the blood has further improved the detection of CMV in neutropenic patients and has been associated with improved survival over viral culture [43] . After treatment of patients for CMV, the physician should remain aware that the risk of subsequent bacterial and fungal infections is substantially increased [53, 54, 77, 78] .",

It has the capacity to replicate within human lung tissue and can cause a diffuse viral pneumonitis that can be associated with severe hypoxemia, ARDS, and sometimes multisystem organ failure [79] [80] [81] . Very few cases of severe illness occurred in patients[60 years of age [81, 82] , but underlying immunosuppression was present in about 15 % of patients with 2009 H1N1 disease requiring hospitalization [82] . A retrospective single cancer-center study conducted on May-June 2009 noted that 2009 H1N1 occurred more commonly among patients with an underlying hematological malignancy than among those with solid tumors [83] . Over 90 % of patients presented with cough and fever [83] . Thirty-seven percentage of patients required hospitalization, and 27 % of those that were assessed with radiographs had lower respiratory tract disease [83] . Almost all of these patients received neuraminidase therapy, 86 % received this on clinical presentation, and none of these patients required mechanical ventilation or died due to 2009 H1N1 disease [83] . Early administration of oseltamivir to patients who have 2009 H1N1 influenza has been associated with better outcomes and lower risk of death [81, 82] . Thus, when influenza is occurring in the community, empiric therapy for influenza should be instituted in patients with compatible symptoms awaiting results of testing [81] . Additionally, therapy should be continued in patients with negative testing if severe or progressive disease exists until an alternative diagnosis is established due to PCR being falsely negative in *10 % of specimens [81] . Notably,[1/3 of healthy patients will continue to shed 2009 H1N1 or seasonal influenza by PCR for [7 days after onset of illness; viral shedding may be even more prolonged in hospitalized patients or patients with underlying immunosuppression [81, [84] [85] [86] . It is uncertain whether detectable influenza genetic material represents viable replicating virus [84] . Delayed viral clearance has been associated with late initiation of oseltamivir [81, 84, 85] and has been associated with comorbidities and with prolonged hospital stays [85] .",

            "text": "Chest radiography (chest X-ray) is necessary for the routine evaluation of patients suspected of having pneumonia due to its superior sensitivity and specificity over that of physical examination [14] . It is recommended in cancer patients that are febrile, neutropenic, and have any respiratory signs or symptoms [87] . It can be useful in suggesting other potential etiologies (e.g., congestive heart failure) and pathogens. Interstitial or peribronchial infiltrates are classically associated with viral pathogens, while lobar or alveolar infiltrates are more frequently seen with bacterial pathogens; however, substantial overlap exists. About 70 % of children with documented bacterial pneumonia will have airspace disease [8] . In children with influenza that have pulmonary infiltrates, up to 50 % may have an alveolar component to their infiltrate [88] . With 2009 H1N1 influenza, radiographic findings commonly included diffuse mixed interstitial and alveolar infiltrates [81] . In patients with bacterial superinfection of 2009 H1N1, lobar and a multilobar distribution can occur [81] . Chest radiography can also help identify a complicated pneumonia-usually defined as necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, loculated pleural fluid, or empyema. Presence of an effusion suggests a bacterial processparticularly S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, or S. pyogenes. Lateral decubitus films are useful in determining whether an effusion associated with pneumonia is freeflowing or loculated (suggested by failure of the fluid to move to the dependent region of the chest with changes in position). Chest X-rays are particularly limited in the early detection of pneumonia in patients with cancer, particularly when obtained in the supine position [89] . It is also well known that a delay in chest X-ray appearance of pneumonia can occur; thus, patients who have a high clinical suspicion of pneumonia should be treated presumptively for 24-48 h before repeating the chest X-ray [14] . High-resolution CT scanning has improved sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia over that of chest X-ray in patients without underlying cancer [90] . The sensitivity of chest X-ray in comparison with CT scan has been shown to be about 50 % [89] . In one study, the use of high-resolution CT scanning resulted in a median increase of 5 days in the time of detection of a pulmonary infiltrate over that of using chest X-rays alone [91] . Importantly, in those with a negative highresolution CT scan, no individuals developed an inflammatory lung lesion within the next 5 days and \\10 % developed an inflammatory lung lesion within the next 20 days [91] . CT angiography can help in the evaluation of pulmonary embolism which is also common in oncology patients while still proving substantial information about the lung parenchyma and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Although classic findings on CT imaging include consolidation with bacterial disease, nodules with fungal disease, a perihilar ground glass opacity with PCP, and a mosaic pattern of ground glass opacities with viral disease, these findings are nonspecific and not diagnostic [89] . CT can be helpful in suggesting noninfectious etiologies (e.g., radiation pneumonitis, drug toxicity, malignancy) and in providing precise localization of the infiltrate for subsequent diagnostic procedures [89] .",

It should be recognized that S. pneumoniae is considered the predominant pathogen in CAP; it is identified in about 2/3 of bacteremic pneumonia [3, 96] . A recent study using transthoracic lung aspiration has confirmed this finding [97] . Some evidence suggests that although Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydiophila pneumoniae are relatively common causes of pneumonia in outpatients, they are infrequently observed in patients with severe disease in whom S. aureus, Legionella species, and gram-negative bacilli are more frequently observed [3] .

            "text": "In general, more aggressive diagnostic strategies are necessary in patients with cancer than in patients without cancer who present with a routine pneumonia. This is due to the higher likelihood of alternative diagnostic possibilities (e.g., metastatic malignancy). As well, unusual pathogens (e.g., PCP, tuberculosis) and multidrug-resistant pathogens occur with a higher frequency. A higher rate of clinical failure and mortality has been observed in patients with pneumonia that are not initiated on appropriate antimicrobial therapy [13, 14, [98] [99] [100] [101] . In another study of 200 immunocompromised patients (140 of which had either hematological malignancy or SCT), mortality was associated with SCT (53 % vs. Tables 3 and 4 outline routine and supplemental testing that may be of potential benefit in patients with underlying malignancies who present with pneumonia. Although blood cultures identify a pathogen in 5-14 % of patients with CAP [3, 14] , these are particularly important in patients with underlying malignancies in whom other etiologies (e.g., central line infection with embolic lung lesions) must be considered. Sputum cultures, although not universally recommended [3] , are likely to be of higher benefit in patients with underlying malignancies in whom common pathogens are less frequently observed. Obtaining sputum for culture prior to antibiotic administration increases the yield. In particular, they can be helpful in identifying pathogens that empiric coverage may not have adequately covered (e.g., MRSA, a drug-resistant gram-negative rod). A number of tests for the presence of antigens have been developed for identifying fungal and bacterial pathogens. Several important caveats exist for antigen tests. First, all of the antigen tests have sensitivities that are\\90 % and some much less than this. Thus, they should not be viewed as tests that can ''rule out'' the presence of a pathogen. Second, the antigen tests are most sensitive before or shortly after initiation of treatment with an agent that has activity against the specific pathogen. These tests generally become negative fairly quickly and in some cases (e.g., histoplasmosis) can be used to gauge response to therapy. Finally, these tests are more sensitive in the setting of disseminated disease than in pneumonia alone. Urinary antigen assays for Legionella (70 % sensitivity, [90 % specificity for serogroup 1) and S. pneumoniae (60-90 % sensitivity with approaching 100 % specificity) should be obtained from patients who have failed outpatient antibiotic therapy, those with pleural effusions, and those requiring intensive care admission for pneumonia [3, 14] . It should be recognized that many other Legionella species can cause pneumonia but are not detected by the urinary antigen; to diagnose these species, culture or PCR of respiratory specimens is necessary. In patients at risk of endemic fungal disease, urinary antigen tests exist for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidiodiomycosis that have excellent sensitivities but some risk of cross-reaction with other fungal pathogens including other endemic fungi and Penicillium [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] . Response to therapy can be followed by obtaining serial specimens for some of these urinary antigen tests [103] .",

Thus, it is not specific for Aspergillus and has been found to be positive in patients with candidemia and with cyptococcosis, fusariosis, PCP, and histoplasmosis [109] [110] [111] [112] . The sensitivity of this test for Aspergillus has ranged from 50 to 100 % with a specificity that ranges from 44 to 98 % [108, 111] . In clinical practice, the (1?3)-b-D-glucan assay was not found to be helpful in discriminating fungal from bacterial infections in the intensive care unit setting Limited availability, primarily a research tool c Determine whether pleural fluid is transudate or exudate CBC complete blood count, PA posteroanterior, hpf high-power field, PCR polymerase chain reaction; RSV respiratory syncytial virus, DFA direct fluorescent antibody, KOH potassium hydroxide, AFB acid fast bacilli, PCP Pneumocystis jerovechi, and RNA ribonucleic acid [113] . Even in healthy populations, a false-positive rate of 7-20 % has been observed, which may be even higher in populations at risk for invasive fungal infections [108] . False positives have also been observed with certain medications, following hemodialysis, with use of IV tubing filters, with administration of albumin or immunoglobulin, and after exposure to gauze [108, 111] . Additionally, echinocandins interfere with (1?3)-b-D-glucan synthesis and administration of an echinocandin (e.g., caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin) may be associated with a falsely negative assay [110] .",

The best cutoff for the Aspergillus galactomannan test to optimize sensitivity while maintaining a high degree of specificity has been an area of intensive investigation. Obtaining the Aspergillus EIA twice weekly with C2 samples C0.5 to 1.0 can result in earlier diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [114, 115] . Unfortunately, false-negative and false-positive results can occur with the Aspergillus galactomannan test. Administration of piperacillin-tazobactam is associated with false-positive tests, which may be due to galactomannan being carried through the drug production processing stages from Penicillium [116, 117] . False-positive tests have also occurred after receipt of other Penicillium-derived antibiotics including amoxicillin and ticarcillin both with and without a beta-lactamase inhibitor [108] . Additionally, false-positive tests have occurred in patients infected with all of the endemic fungi, and with Fusarium, Rhodotorula, Trichophyton, Penicillium, Paecilomyces, and Alternaria species [108, 116, 118] . Plasmalyte (Baxter Healthcare Corporation), an electrolyte replacement solution containing sodium gluconate produced by Aspergillus flavus, has also been associated with falsepositive Aspergillus galactomannan tests [108, 119] . Probably the most frequent cause of a false-negative Aspergillus galactomannan test is the administration of mold-active antifungal therapy. Marr et al. demonstrated that the sensitivity of the galactomannan test fell from 89 to 52 % in patients receiving mold-active antifungal therapy [120] . False-negative results have also been noted in patients who have localized Aspergillus infections [108] .",

In part, this is due to the difficulty that exists in obtaining a tissue diagnosis which would prove invasive fungal disease. In general, host factors predisposing the patient to fungal infection (e.g., neutropenia, GVHD), clinical features of fungal infection (e.g., CT imaging showing a halo sign or an air-crescent sign, sinusitis), and mycological evidence of infection (e.g., positive antigen test, positive culture) all must be present to demonstrate a probable case of invasive fungal disease [121] . In clinical practice, many cases are possible cases and this should not dissuade the clinician from treating for invasive fungal disease since these guidelines were primarily written to help develop common research definitions [121] .",

            "text": "Commonly performed viral testing strategies are outlined in Table 3 . In the past several years, there has been increasing realization of the poor sensitivity of most rapid antigen tests in identifying viral pathogens [29, 81] and an increased reliance upon the use of PCR [43, 59, 122, 123] . In the past, many ''home-brew'' PCRbased assays were used at various centers [43] . In many centers, PCR is available for testing for the most common respiratory pathogens (e.g., influenza and RSV) and for CMV. Some centers also have access to the FDA-approved XTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) which has the ability to test for influenza A, B, RSV A and B, parainfluenza types 1-3, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus [43] . Real-time PCR provides more rapid results that are quantitative and can also detect multiple viruses simultaneously [43] . In a recent retrospective study of SCT recipients, quantitative PCR viral load of respiratory virus RNA from BAL specimens did not correlate with subsequent mechanical ventilation or death [124] . In contrast, 5/6 patients from the same study, who had viral RNA detected in serum specimens, died. In a multivariate analysis, detection of viral RNA in serum was associated with an adjusted relative risk of death within 30 days of 1.8 in comparison with those who were not viremic [124] . These results remain to be confirmed, but could provide useful prognostic information in the future. Several caveats to PCR testing for viral pathogens should be emphasized. PCR identification of a virus may indicate recent infection but not active disease. Data for this are lacking in cancer patients, but in healthy infants, prolonged shedding of RSV by real-time PCR has been observed (20-30 days after symptoms begin) [43, 125] . Although PCR is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of 2009 H1N1, PCR specimens from both the upper and lower respiratory tracts have been falsely negative in about 10 % of patients [81] . In addition, cross-contamination of samples can easily occur with PCR, resulting in false-positive tests. Thus, PCR results should always be viewed in the context of the clinical scenario of the patient and additional respiratory specimen types should be obtained in a patient in whom the clinical impression is discordant with the test results [81] .",

In the test, the patient's blood is mixed in vitro with tuberculosis-specific antigen that then results in the release of interferon gamma from any T cells that have previously been exposed to tuberculosis. The benefit of this test is that there is not the potential for cross-reaction in patients who have previously been exposed to BCG vaccine (administered routinely in countries of the world in which tuberculosis is endemic). It should be recognized that a PPD is least sensitive for detecting prior tuberculosis disease when the patient is actively infected with tuberculosis. For example, in a study from Africa of TB and HIV-infected patients, the IGRA was 65 % sensitive, while the PPD was 31 % sensitive [126] . Both PPD and IGRA were least sensitive in those with CD4 counts \\200 [126] . Data regarding use of the IGRA are lacking in patients with active tuberculosis and cancer. Thus, neither a negative PPD nor a negative IGRA rules out the possibility of active tuberculosis. Instead, anyone suspected of having active pulmonary tuberculosis should immediately be placed in negative pressure isolation and undergo sputum evaluation for tuberculosis.",

Thus, an unusual clinical presentation, particularly severe pneumonia (e.g., necessitating ICU admission or intubation with mechanical ventilation), and failure to respond to initial empiric antimicrobial therapy within 48-72 h should all prompt aggressive diagnostic measures with attempts to obtain deep specimens or tissue early in the clinical course of pneumonia. Several issues are frequently raised as objections to diagnostic procedures in this population. First, patients frequently have coagulopathies due to their underlying malignancy or chemotherapy. Second, concern may exist about risk of introducing infection in those who are immunosuppressed. Third, many patients are clinically unstable and at risk for needing more substantial respiratory support (either noninvasive mechanical ventilation or routine mechanical ventilation) after a procedure. Fourth, those in whom a diagnostic procedure is considered often have been pretreated with broad-spectrum empiric coverage. Thus, the yield from the procedure is often low.

Several severity scores have been developed for deciding which individuals with CAP should be admitted. The most common severity scores are the CURB-65 and the PORT score/pneumonia severity index (PSI). The CURB-65 scale does not take into account any underlying comorbidities, but instead gives a single point for each factor noted in clinical assessment: Confusion, elevated Urea Nitrogen, Respiratory rate (C30 breaths/min), low Blood pressure, and age [65 years. The points for each of these factors are then added together and are validated with 30-day mortality data. For patients with a score of 0, mortality is 0.7 %, 1 = 2.1 %, 2 = 9.2 %, 3 = 14.5 %, 4 = 40 %, and 5 = 57 % [3, 14] . Thus, patients with scores of 0-1 are often treated as outpatients, 2 is recommended to be admitted to the general medical wards, and C3 should be admitted to the intensive care unit [14] . It is important to realize that CURB-65 does not take into account patients with underlying malignancy in which mortality would be expected to be even higher. The PORT score or PSI is more complicated and requires addition of additional variables, but does take into account underlying renal disease, liver disease, and malignancy [14, 134] . Again, higher scores correlate with higher mortality. Forms for calculating both CURB-65 and the PSI are widely available both on the Internet and also as applications for PDAs. It is recommended that scoring systems should contribute to and not supersede clinical judgment [3] . Both severity scoring systems underestimate the mortality in patients with underlying malignancy and severity scoring system is validated neither in HAP/VAP nor in patients with neutropenia nor those who are severely immunocompromised.",

Patients receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis should not be treated empirically with a fluoroquinolone if they become ill [87] . In addition, prior colonization with multi-drug-resistant pathogens should be taken into account in empiric coverage. For example, prior colonization with MRSA should prompt empiric coverage with an agent known to be active this pathogen (e.g., vancomycin, linezolid). It should be noted that daptomycin is not effective in the treatment of pneumonia which may be due to binding of the drug by surfactant in the lungs [135] . Additionally, recent drug-resistant microbiological isolates (e.g., carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae) identified from a patient should prompt the physician to modify empiric antibiotics to include drugs that will include the drug-resistant pathogen(s).",

In those who meet criteria for HCAP, HAP, or VAP, risk factors for drug resistance usually exist. Empiric coverage with an antipseudomonal b-lactam or carbapenem plus either an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside plus an agent active against MRSA (vancomycin or linezolid) is warranted [13] . In the setting of neutropenic fever, empiric coverage will usually appear fairly similar to that of the HAP/VAP guidelines although coverage with an agent active against atypical organisms is important for those being admitted from home (e.g., levofloxacin or a macrolide). Empiric coverage for aspiration may also be necessary or for influenza, depending on the time of year. In the setting of MDR pathogens such as carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii or carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, consultation with a local infectious disease specialist is encouraged to help make recommendations based on the local antibiotic sensitivity patterns.",

Limited data suggest that in those with a negative high-resolution CT scan, this strategy of withholding empiric antifungal therapy was not associated with an increased risk of invasive fungal infections or death [140] . This approach is not considered the current standard of practice as defined in the 2011 guidelines for the management of febrile neutropenia but is an interesting approach and an active area of research [87] . Empiric coverage with a mold-active agent such as liposomal amphotericin or an echinocandin is recommended [87] . Among those with neutropenia who actually have invasive fungal disease, a subset will get clinically worse usually as the neutropenia resolves and an acute inflammatory response occurs at the site of preexisting fungal infection.

Noninfectious infiltrates occur commonly in these patients and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Recent molecular methods have improved our capacity to diagnose the pathogens responsible for pneumonia, but frequently empiric therapy is still necessary and should take into account the patient's underlying risk factors for multi-drugresistant pathogens, viruses, and fungi. Since many pathogens can cause disease in this population, in those not responding to empiric therapy, aggressive diagnostic testing and tissue sampling is necessary to help focus treatment modalities.",
