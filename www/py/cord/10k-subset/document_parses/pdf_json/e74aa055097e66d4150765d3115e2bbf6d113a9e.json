Up-regulated mir-21 enhances transcription of fibronectin (FN) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), but gene silencing of mir-21 inhibits collagen deposition and myofibroblast differentiation 4 . To study the role of mir-21 in lung fibroblasts, we enhanced the mir-21 level by transfection with mir-21 precursors (pre-21), and qRT-PCR analysis showed that mir-21 was increased significantly compared with pre-NC (control miRNA precursors) group (Fig. 1A) . Overexpression of mir-21 inhibited apoptosis and up-regulated a-collagen I synthesis in lung fibroblasts (Fig. 1C ,E) accompanied by increased p-ERK-NLRP3 inflammasome complex (NLRP3, Pro-caspase-1), Pro-IL-1\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2 protein levels, but decreased Spry1 protein levels ( Fig. 1B,C) . Conversely, U0126 and BAY117082 inhibited NF-\u03baB translocation, the protein levels of Pro-IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and caspase-1 induced by pre-mir-21 ( Fig. 1B ,C,E), as well as apoptosis resistance and a-collagen I synthesis. Immunofluorescence staining showed that mir-21 induced co-localization of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in cytoplasm, which could be abolished by U0126 and BAY 117082 (Fig. 1D) . These data indicate that mir-21 inhibited apoptosis and promoted a-collagen I synthesis by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome via the Spry1/ERK/NF-\u03baB pathway in lung fibroblasts.",

However, the precise mechanism of this effect needs to be further explored. In 2012, Adam et al. 24 reported that AngII up-regulates the expression of mir-21 in cardiac fibroblasts. To test whether AngII promotes mir-21 expression in lung fibroblasts, the cells were treated with AngII (10 \u22127 mmol/L) at different time points, and the expression of mir-21 was determined. As shown in Fig. 2A , the mir-21 level increased significantly in a time-dependent manner after treatment with AngII. Consistent with our previous findings, AngII treatment inhibited apoptosis and promoted a-collagen I synthesis in lung fibroblasts (Fig. 2E ,F). Furthermore, protein levels of ERK/NF-\u03baB and the NLRP3 inflammasome were increased, but Spry1 was decreased after AngII treatment (Fig. 2C ,E). We therefore explored whether the effects of AngII are mediated by mir-21. Mir-21 antisense probes were used to reduce mir-21 expression level in AngII-treated cells (Fig. 2B ). AngII-induced changes of protein levels of the Spry1/ERK/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and a-collagen I were restored by mir-21 antisense probes (Fig. 2C,E) . Similarly, knocking down mir-21 inhibited the effect on apoptosis resistance of AngII (Fig. 2F ). Immunofluorescent staining of NLRP3 and caspase-1 produced the same result (Fig. 2D) . Thus, mir-21 mediated AngII-induced apoptosis resistance and a-collagen I synthesis in lung fibroblasts.",

We therefore investigated whether ACE2 and Ang (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) interfere with the effects of AngII on mir-21 expression. As shown in Fig. 3A , ACE2/Ang(1-7) markedly decreased the expression of mir-21 induced by AngII. The Spry1/ERK/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway was activated and a-collagen I synthesis was markedly increased in response to AngII treatment in lung fibroblasts, along with decreased apoptosis. This response was abolished by ACE2 and Ang(1-7) [ Fig. 3B -D]. These in vitro results suggest that mir-21 mediated the inhibitory effect of ACE2/Ang(1-7) on AngII-induced apoptosis resistance and a-collagen I synthesis in lung fibroblasts. ACE2/Ang(1-7) failed to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and a-collagen I induced by mir-21 over-expression. In investigating the links of ACE2 /Ang(1-7) and mir-21 in pulmonary fibrosis, we found that the protein levels of ERK/NF-\u03baB, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and collagen were increased, but Spry1 was decreased by over-expression of mir-21, and these effects could not be reversed by ACE2/Ang(1-7)",

It has been extensively researched and serves as a potential biomarker for diagnosing cancer and determining its prognosis 27 . Increasing additional roles [28] [29] [30] in other diseases suggest that elevated mir-21 expression may represent a common feature of pathological progression, including fibrotic diseases. It has been reported that mir-21 levels are up-regulated in fibrosis of the kidneys 31 , heart 32 , liver 9 , and lungs 7 , and that targeting mir-21 therapeutically may have the ability to prevent development of organ fibrosis 4 . Furthermore, recent studies have shown that mir-21 is involved in the promotion of fibrogenic activation of fibroblasts in different organs 2 . Consistent with these results, we found that mir-21 l was markedly up-regulated in the lung of BLM-treated rats in vivo, and that over-expression of mir-21 inhibited lung fibroblast apoptosis and promoted collagen synthesis in vitro. As it has also been shown that the pro-fibrotic factors transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 33 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 4 promote fibrogenesis by up-regulating mir-21, we investigated whether other pro-fibrotic factors can activate mir-21. AngII, the principal effector peptide of the vasoconstrictor arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has a key role in the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation and fibrosis in experimental lung fibrosis 34 , and it is now becoming apparent that mir-21 is transcriptionally activated in cardiac fibrosis related to AngII 32 . Adam et al. 24 have also reported that AngII up-regulates the expression of mir-21 in cardiac fibroblasts, resulting in their activation and atrial fibrosis. Thus, we propose that the pro-fibrotic effect of AngII may be associated with its augmentation of mir-21. Consistent with previous findings, we found that mir-21 levels were significantly increased in lung fibroblasts treated with AngII. Moreover, the effects of AngII in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting collagen synthesis can be reversed by silencing mir-21 in lung fibroblasts. In BLM-treated rats, constant infusion of exogenous AngII significantly up-regulated the expression of mir-21 and aggravated lung fibrosis. Hence, AngII-induced mir-21 promoted collagen synthesis in lung fibroblasts and exacerbated BLM-induced lung fibrosis.",

Ning et al. 18 discovered that Spry1, an important target gene of mir-21, can inhibit the ERK/NF-\u03baB pathway, which is involved in liver fibrosis 18 . In this study, we have shown that mir-21 over-expression or AngII-induced mir-21 significantly increased p-ERK and NF-\u03baB nucleoprotein levels, but decreased the Spry1 protein level in lung fibroblasts. Moreover, mir-21 silencing inhibited the Spry1/ERK/ NF-\u03baB pathway activation. Collectively, we demonstrated that AngII-induced mir-21 mediated ERK/NF-\u03baB pathway activation by targeting Spry1 in lung fibroblasts. NF-\u03baB is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of a large number of genes, including the NLRP3 inflammasome.",

Furthemore, our previous studies have demonstrated NLRP3 inflammasome mediated AngII-induced pulmonary fibrosis in animal models. In accordance with these results, we found the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 secretion axis was activated by AngII or mir-21 over-expression in lung fibroblasts, and that this can be reversed by anti-mir-21 probes.

            "text": "The ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas pathway is involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes in several systems and organs, notably by opposing the detrimental effects of inappropriate over-activation of the ACE/ AngII/AT1R axis 40 . Li et al. 41 consider that Ang(1-7) protects against experimental lung fibrosis by limiting the local tissue accumulation of AngII that occurs in response to BLM-induced lung injury, which is consistent with our previous studies. However, the precise molecular mechanism of the anti-fibrotic effect of ACE2/Ang(1-7) remains to be elucidated. We found that the effect of AngII-induced mir-21 was abolished by ACE2/Ang(1-7) in lung fibroblasts in vitro, and that exogenous Ang(1-7) infusion or lentiACE2 intratracheal instillation significantly decreased mir-21 expression and attenuated lung fibrosis induced by BLM in vivo. Furthermore, in primary lung fibroblasts, ACE2/Ang(1-7) suppressed AngII-induced ERK phosphorylation, NF-\u03baB nuclei translocation, and degradation of the targeting gene Spry1, and blocked AngII-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In exploring whether these responses of ACE2/Ang1-7 were mediated by mir-21, we found that activation of the Spry1/ERK/ NF-\u03baB pathway and the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 secretion axis by over-expression of mir-21 could not be reversed by ACE2/ Ang(1-7) . Overall, these data suggest that mir-21 mediates the inhibitory effect of ACE2/ Ang (1-7) on AngII-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting Spry1 in lung fibroblasts. Figure 6 . Schematic working hypothesis. It has been demonstrated local RAAS is activated in lung tissue of fibrosis. AngII binds with AT1R in lung fibroblasts to enhance the expression level of mir-21, the recognized pro-fibrotic factor. Mir-21 promotes ERK phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB nuclei translocation by targeting Spry1 degradation, following NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The released proinflammatory factors (Caspase-1/ IL-1) by the inflammasome pathway lead to a-colllagen I synthesis and apoptosis resisitance. ACE2 degrades AngII to produce Ang(1-7), which reverses the AngII's profibrotic effect via downregulating mir-21. As a result, mir-21 and NLRP3 inflammasome play a key in local RAAS imbalance induced lung fibrosis.",

Exogenous ACE2/Ang(1-7) over-expression protected against BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis by down-regulating mir-21. These findings suggest a critical role of mir-21 in both the pro-fibrotic effect of AngII and the anti-fibrotic effect of ACE2/ Ang(1-7) in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
