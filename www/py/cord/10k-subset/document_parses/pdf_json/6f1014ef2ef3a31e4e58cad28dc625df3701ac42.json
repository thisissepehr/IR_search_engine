The results of my study corroborate those observations. Looking at the expression of the 36 most significant hippocampal genes of all 40 subjects Table 2 ).

Remarkably, of the 30 known genes out of the 36 most significant genes, 27 were -in terms of function -either genes of inflammation or genes of immune system activation (Table 1 ). This suggests that -to a large extent, and insofar as it pertains to the hippocampal area of the brain -the dual process of a chronic inflammation and the elicited chronic immune-system response and activity can differentiate between old and young brains with a high accuracy. This is further supported by the fact that the aforementioned seven genes employed by the F 1 super variable, all of which are genes of inflammation or genes of immune system activation, can discriminate between old and young brains with almost a perfect accuracy [sensitivity 5 (24/25) 5 0.96 and specificity 5 (15/15) 5 1.00].", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 412, "end": 419, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 629, "end": 651, "text": "(Supplementary Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1353, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "and Supplementary"}, {"text": "The seven genes [C4A (C4B), ADORA3, MS4A7, BCL6, CD44, C3AR1, and HLA-DRB1], which are the constituent input variables of the model (F 1 super variable), and all of which are -in terms of function -inflammation or immune system activation genes (Table 1) , were all found to be over-expressed in the old subjects compared with the young subjects (Table 1) .

Using animal models or human subjects with early-stage neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer, other studies have observed a link between neuroinflammation and deficits in synaptic plasticity, especially long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, which is associated with longterm memory consolidation [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] 2 . The fact that definitive causality cannot be established here notwithstanding -in other words, whether it is the normal aging process that induces inflammation/ immune-system-overactivity, or whether the vice versa occurs, or whether another, hitherto unspecified, process engenders the normal aging process, which in turn induces inflammation/immune-systemoveractivity, or whether that unspecified process engenders inflammation/immune-system-overactivity, which in turn induces the normal aging process -the results of my study support a direct causal link between the normal aging process and the process of inflammation/immune-system-overactivity. When considered collectively, therefore, the results of my study and all of the above observations from the other aforementioned studies point to a plausible theory on the normal aging process. At some point in time, chronic, low-level inflammation establishes itself and elicits a corresponding chronic immune response and activity. These two conjugate processes ultimately are responsible for a gradual loss of synaptic plasticity, particularly LTP in the hippocampus, accompanied with a minimal neuronal loss 33, 34, [1] [2] [3] .
