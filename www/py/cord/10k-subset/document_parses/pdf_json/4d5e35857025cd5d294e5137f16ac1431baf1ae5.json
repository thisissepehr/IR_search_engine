The starting point of Candida infection is the gastroenteric tract, colonised by this fungal agent in 30\u00b160 % of the normal subjects, and the manipulations at the time of the transplant can cause the diffusion of the pathogens. Surgical instrumentation and central catheters are the major source of Aspergillus, Criptococcus and Mucor, which are non-endogenous agents, but are always acquired from the environment. As significant risks of postOLT fungal infections, a surgical time > 12 h, intratransplant transfusional requirements, bacterial infections within the first 2 months after OLT together with prolonged systemic antibiotic therapy, reinterventions and high dose immunosuppression have been cited [4, 12, 34] . Accordingly, a significant correlation has been observed in our population between OKT3 immunosuppression and fungal pneumonia. The incidence of Candida infections in the different OLT series varies from 11 to 42 % according to the type of bowel decontamination and antifungal prophylaxis performed. The usual site of infection is abdominal. The mortality rate from fungal infection after OLT ranges from 70 to 90 % and is higher in fungal superinfections of pre-existing infiltrates. Accordingly, in the present series, the majority of Candida pneumonia superinfected bacterial or viral infections and had a fatal outcome in 70 % of the cases [12, 34] . Aspergillus infection most commonly appears as pneumonia or disseminated infection with mortality rates that approach 100 %. The one observed case of aspergillosis in our series was present as an isolated pathogen with lethal pneumonia. The chest radiographic features of fungal infections consisted of multiple nodular opacities with intense alveolar infiltrates, with tendency to central cavitation and air bronchograms or nodules with hazy margins or clusters of fluffy nodules. The nodules of fungal pneumonia tended to be multiple rather than solitary, and a prevalent involvement of the upper lobes is frequently observed. Pleural effusion and adenopathy may be seen [20] . In the present study, the radiological pattern of Candida infections or superinfections showed multifocal areas of air space consolidations, usually not associated with pleural effusion. In those cases which do not respond to therapy, the nodules may coalesce to larger regions of consolidation and, eventually, to the typical appearance of ARDS. In aspergillosis the nodules were rapid growing and showed a crescent-shaped area of hyperlucency (\u00aaair crescent sign\u00ba) representing cavitation around the pre-existing dense central nodule.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 333, "end": 337, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1051, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1055, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1059, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1710, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1714, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2390, "end": 2394, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fungal pneumonia"}, {"text": "Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in organ transplants has a reported incidence of 0\u00b114 %, depending on the specific prophylaxis adopted [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14] .

In a previously published study on the first 100 cases of OLT [9] , prolonged ICU and AMV, advanced UNOS status, OKT3 immunosuppression and pulmonary oedema were identified as highly predictive risk factors for the onset of pulmonary infections. The present study, performed on a wider patient population, demonstrated, in univariate analysis, a significantly increased association of pulmonary infection with the following five risk factors: caval traditional anastomosis, retransplantation, OKT3 immunosuppression, ICU stay and AMV duration, pulmonary non-inflammatory abnormalities, such as effusion and atelectasis, and oedema. In our multivariate analysis, the strongest independent risk factors for pneumonia were non-infectious abnormalities (atelectasis and pleural effusion) and pulmonary oedema, followed by prolonged AMV, whereas piggy-back caval anastomosis is shown to be significant as a protection factor, preventing the onset of pneumonia, as compared with traditional caval anastomosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 71, "end": 74, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 75, "end": 77, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 78, "end": 81, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 82, "end": 85, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 86, "end": 89, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 506, "end": 509, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia"}, {"text": "In our experience, which differs from previous studies [6, 8, 9, 30] , basal liver disease, UNOS score and graft rejection do not represent statistically significant risk factors for pneumonia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 55, "end": 58, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 59, "end": 61, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 62, "end": 64, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 65, "end": 68, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia"}, {"text": "About surgically related risks, traditional caval anastomosis is demonstrated in our series to be more risky than the piggy-back technique. Liver transplantation with preservation of the recipient vena cava (the piggyback technique), which avoids retrocaval dissection [23] , reduces overall time of surgery, need of blood transfusions and postoperative renal failure, with earlier extubation, shorter ICU and total hospital stay. Due to these advantages, the follow-up of OLTs performed with the piggy-back technique showed, in the present study, non-infectious pulmonary abnormalities of a less severe degree, thus resulting in a significantly lower rate of pneumonia as compared with traditional caval anastomosis and a significantly reduced overall mortality rate. In multivariate analysis the piggy-back technique represents a significant factor preventing postoperative pneumonia and mortality. In accordance with the studies of the Mayo Clinic and other authors [6, 7] , our results confirm a significantly higher percentage of major infections after retransplantation than in a single graft. Retransplant also represents a significant risk of mortality. Anti-T-cell antibody (OKT3) immunosuppressive therapy has previously been described as a strong risk factor for serious infection in the weeks following treatment [31, 35] . A significantly higher incidence of severe pneumonia with fatal outcome in the majority of cases has been also confirmed in our series. A further serious complication of OKT3 is the onset of acute pulmonary oedema during the first 2 days of treatment, which could predispose to superinfections. This usually appears in patients already overloaded with fluid prior to treatment. In 21 of 30 cases in our series, diffuse interstitial oedema was evident, with a slight increase in VPW: clear alveolar oedema was never observed due to diuretics routinely administered in the days before the injection of OKT3. A prolonged stay in ICU has been reported as the only significant risk factor for the onset of infections in liver graft recipients [6] . Our statistical univariate analysis confirms this as one of the major risk factors for infection: 27 of 41 infections in our series (65.9 %) developed in ICU, and in 20 cases during AMV (48.8 %). Multivariate analysis, instead, demonstrates that the ICU stay risk in the global population is paradoxically \u00aaa protection\u00ba against infection and mortality, and that it is only indirectly significant because it is related to the real \u00aamajor\u00ba risk for pneumonia and related mortality, represented by prolonged intubation and AMV. Protracted AMV has been previously identified as a risk factor for developing nosocomial infection [15] . The high percentage of Pseudomonas pneumonia observed in the present series (41.5 %) was directly related to a longer duration of AMV during the ICU stay. Prolonged intubation and AMV were shown to be, in multivariate analysis, the greatest independent risk factors for mortality. Among the variables studied, the pre-existing pulmonary abnormalities \u00b1 pleural effusion, atelectasis and pulmonary oedema \u00b1 were shown to be the greatest independent predictors of pneumonia in our OLT population. Persistent effusion, atelectasis and pulmonary oedema triple the risk of developing infectious complications. The vast majority of infections (37 of 41) were ipsilateral and superimposed on these previously non-infectious lesions, which constitute \u00aalocus minoris resistentiae\u00ba especially in nosocomial bacterial infections (Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus).
