Recent advancement in safety test technologies led to the introduction of new standards of current Good Manufacturing Procedures (GMP) for production of viral inocula [12] . The traditional method of producing a virus inoculum for use in experimental infection is to isolate a \"seed virus\" from nasal secretions of a donor who had been infected via natural exposure. This approach is labor intensive in that the donor needs to be checked for any other infectious agents and then observed for 1 year to ensure there are no other coinfections [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 337, "end": 340, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 341, "end": 344, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 345, "end": 348, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 349, "end": 352, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 353, "end": 356, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 357, "end": 360, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 361, "end": 364, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 365, "end": 368, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 548, "end": 552, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 922, "end": 926, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In this report, we describe the development of a reverse genetics (RG) approach to produce an inoculum of a major group clinical isolate (RV-A16). This approach has 2 advantages compared to traditional procedures. First, several \"new\" respiratory viruses (eg, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, WU and KI polyomaviruses [14, 15] ) have been discovered in the past decade, and additional infectious agents will likely be discovered in the future. Therefore, it is difficult to ensure that nasal secretions that are chosen for isolation of seed virus do not contain any other pathogens. This problem is minimized through the use of a cloned viral genome to produce the inoculum virus in vitro. A second potential advantage is the ability to produce multiple inocula from the same cloned sequence. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, such as RV, have high mutation rates during genome replication because their RNA polymerases have no error-correcting function. A complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) clone, which is amplified by the highly accurate Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, provides a stable source of virus sequence for production of future inocula.

In contrast, many viruses now used for laboratory studies come from American Type Culture Collection isolates that are adapted to tissue culture cell lines such as HeLa cells. It is notable that the RG-RV-A16 1086 and 1088 sequences differ from those of a previously sequenced HeLa-adapted laboratory strain [31] at approximately 200 bases (data not shown). This represents a difference of approximately 3%, which is similar to the genetic discordance between a mouse and a rat. These findings underscore the utility of having a stable sequence source for RV-A16 that can be used to make virus suspensions with a high degree of sequence identity that can be used for both inoculation studies and in vitro studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 504, "end": 508, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This study was designed to identify the dose that would cause colds of moderate severity in at least 75% of study subjects. Symptoms and viral RNA shedding were both dose related. It is notable that 5 of 26 (19%) volunteers who were inoculated developed infections with community-acquired viruses. In these subjects, the community-acquired viruses were present but not yet symptomatic at the day of inoculation, and either coinfections or sequential infections were established. This demonstrates the importance of screening for other viruses during inoculation studies and determining the type of any viruses that are detected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "One challenge in conducting this study was the prolonged regulatory pathway for this first-in-human recombinant RV inoculum (Supplemental Table 3 ). Some of the delays were due to regulatory changes that were prompted by the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic, raising concerns about introducing a virus into the wild that had been synthesized in the laboratory, albeit from wild-type sequences. In addition, the detection of porcine circovirus in a live-attenuated rotavirus vaccine in 2010 [32] led to additional requirements for testing of the viral inoculum for bovine and porcine viruses that could theoretically be introduced by animal products (eg, serum) used to manufacture RG-RV-A16. Now that RG procedures for RV have been established, production of additional viral vaccines or inocula using recombinant techniques should be straightforward. Once the virus is cloned, production is a 2-day process. One significant delay in the traditional production process of inocula grown from nasal secretions is that the virus donor must undergo thorough testing for other infectious agents, and a 1-year follow-up is recommended [13] . Using a cloned virus instead of nasal secretions as the source of the seed virus obviates this 1-year delay. Strengths of this study include the use of a novel viral inoculum, use of viral diagnostics to identify community viruses in the study subjects, and molecular characterization of all viruses detected. We also documented for the first time the low risk (1 in 42 [2.4%]) for transmission of inoculum virus to household contacts. Another potential advantage of the RG approach is that it could be used in the future to study effects of mutations of specific viral sequences. Limitations include inclusion of healthy adults as study subjects; it is possible that individuals with chronic respiratory disease (eg, asthma, COPD) could develop upper and even lower respiratory illnesses with lower doses of virus [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 486, "end": 490, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1129, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1951, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 145, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we have developed the first recombinant RV inoculum using RG techniques and demonstrated that it induces colds that are of similar intensity to those caused by traditional inocula.
