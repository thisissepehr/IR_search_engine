However, pathological or inappropriate apoptosis has significant structural and functional implications for the involved end organs. In mature organisms, ongoing apoptosis maintains cellular homeostasis in renewing cell types such as intestinal epithelium and leucocytes. In contrast, apoptosis is not a feature of non-renewable parenchymal cells in the normal course of events. This is particularly so in terminally differentiated cells such as cardiomyocytes. In the myocardium, the finding of apoptosis after reperfusion is particularly significant as it implies late and potentially avoidable cell death. 1 16 In cardiovascular disease, developments in molecular biology have facilitated an increasing appreciation of the role of apoptosis, not only in heart failure and myocardial infarction but also in IR injury, ageing, vascular wall remodelling and atherosclerotic plaque destabilisation.'' -21 Apoptosis is now recognised to not only contribute to the initiation of these disease states but also to influence long-term outcome in terms of eventual myocardial pump failure or arterial occlusion. Apoptosis occurs acutely but also persists after an initial inflammatory or ischaemic insult, thus perpetuating the injury sustained. As apoptosis is a process that can be potentially attenuated, recognition of its contribution to cardiovascular disease opens exciting new therapeutic avenues.",

Initially, detachment of the affected cell from its surrounding cells occurs. Apoptosis proceeds in an orderly controlled fashion with characteristic cell volume reduction followed by convolution and blebbing of the cell membrane. Condensation of the cytoplasm is reflected in an increased cell density. The nuclear chromatin condenses, in association with activation of an endogenous endonuclease, and gathers beneath the nuclear membrane. The entire cell may now split into membranebound structures with preserved organelle structures. These apoptotic bodies may be visualised within tissues at this stage. The cell now becomes subject to tissue phagocytic cell recognition and action. Membrane integrity is maintained throughout the process, in contrast to the swelling and subsequent rupture of a cell dying by necrosis. The destructive spilling of intracellular contents into the surrounding tissues evoking the classical inflammatory responses of necrosis is absent in apoptosis.

This has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes from apoptotic death in response-simulated IR injury. 30 Although the apoptotic cell does not evoke inflammatory responses to stimulate its removal, it does signal its death to resident tissue phagocytes and neighbouring cells. This is achieved by cell membrane surface expression of the normally exclusively cytoplasmic facing aminophospholipid phosphatidylserine. [31] [32] [33] This phosphatidylserine extrusion facilitates phagocytic removal of the apoptotic cell. It also facilitates phosphatidylserine detecnon on the cell surface by Annexin V, thus allowing for another method of identifying apoptotic cells.TM As phosphatidylserine surface expression is an early event. in the apoptotic pathway, Annexin V labelling allows identification of apoptotic cells at this timepoint. Cell surface phosphatidylserine expression promotes thrombin generation in vitro. 35 This finding raises the possibility that apoptosis seen in atherosclerotic plaques may contribute to their thrombogenicity in vivo. Myocyte apoptosis is difficult to recognise as it affects inchvidual myocytes and is scattered across the muscle or myocardium. The process of apoptosis is rapidly completed in as little as 34 minutes (as assessed by time lapse photography'') and may not be detectable beyond 24 hours.'#-\" Given this fact, the detection of a relatively low prevalence (0.2%) of apoptotic myocytes in the myocardium at a given time point is highly significant, implying that if sustained for one year this would lead to an unsustainable loss of more than 50% of the myocardium. Various investigators have reported great variability in the extent of apoptosis in diseased myocardium, some reporting as high as 35% in ischaemic cardiomyopathies.'\u00b0 The immunohistochemical finding of apoptosis in the myocardium can be further verified by demonstrating DNA laddering on electrophoresis of comparable specimens. 16 Biochemical control of apoptosis The process of apoptosis is orchestrated by the interactions of numerous proto-oncogenes and environmental factors. Initial clues about the genetic command structure of apoptosis were gained from landmark studies on the tiny nematode Caenorhabditis elegans showing that there are 1,090 cell births and 131 cell deaths in the construction of the adult worm.`-`2 Further work identified two genes ced-3 and ced-4 which are essential for the programmed death of these 131 cells. Mutations of these genes permit these cells, which would normally die, to survive. A third gene, ced-9, is necessary to sustain life through tonic inhibition of the. pro-apoptotic genes ced-3 and ced-4. 43 The ced-9 gene shares structural and functional homology with the human bcl-2 gene.",

Bcl-2 expression in myeloid precursors and pro-B cells dramatically improves survival on withdrawal of growth factors. The C. elegans equivalent to bcl-2 was found to be ced-9, whose loss of function mutation precipitated apoptosis, thus characterising it as a negative regulator of apoptosis. 53 Bcl-2 gene expression in humans correlates with resistance to apoptotic cell death. Bcl-2 overexpression confers resistance to the action of gamma radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs that act by inducing DNA damage. It does not prevent damage to the cells from these agents, but rather inhibits apoptosis occurring in response In the heart, diminished bcl-2 expression in the right ventricle has been associated with apoptotic cell death assisting the transition to an adult circulatory system.5 In coronary artery ligation models and in vivo with heart failure, bcl-2 expression is markedly upregulated. 16 This upregulation is suggested to be a compensatory mechanism by the myocardium in the face of widespread cell death. The exact mechanism whereby bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis is uncertain; however, its co-localisation with bax on the mitochondrial membrane suggests this may be a key site.\" The release of mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) into the cytosol activates caspases and thus cell death. 58, a9 Caspase -3, -6 and -7 activation are downstream from bcl-2. 6061 However, bcl-2 blocks the release of cytochrome c and AIF from mitochondria, thus suggesting a potential site for its antiapoptotic activity. 62, 63 Bcl-2 has also been suggested to function as an anti-apoptotic agent through its anti-oxidative role.\u00b0' However, bcl-2 is also anti-apoptotic under anaerobic cell culture conditions and apoptosis occurs in similar circumstances without reactive oxygen species being present bcl-2 still remains protective. 65 ' Therefore, bcl-2 cannot function through purely antioxidant-dependent mechanisms, nor can the generation of reactive oxygen species be an exclusive effector of programmed cell death. 13 The extended Bcl-2 family contains nine members, defined by the presence of three structural motifs in the protein sequence.65'67 These proteins may be pro-or anti-apoptotic and appear to interface after cell surface signals induce caspase activation. Bax is a pro-apoptotic member of this family with 45% homology to bcl-2. It appears that the formation of Bax/Bcl-2 heterodimers is an important control point in apoptosis. 62 Mutations of Bcl-2 may allow it to evade the blocking effect of binding to Bax and thus allow anti-apoptotic signals to assume dominance within the cell. Thus, if the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is altered, this allows the dominant pro-or anti-apoptotic influence to prevail. The overexpression of bcl-2 and the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene bcl-xL have been shown to be associated with an alteration in the onset of toxin-induced apoptosis.^\u2022T he bcl-x member of this family offers protection from apoptosis by binding to bax, thus preventing the formation of bax homodimers which accelerate the apoptotic process.'\u00b0 The observed reduction in bcl-x seen in experimentally injured arteries may therefore allow bax homodimerisation to occur, precipitating smooth muscle cell apoptosis. 7 ' Bcl-2 expression is markedly upregulated in humans with heart failure. However, Bax expression is unaffected. This upregulation occurs in the context of an increase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. `6 The increase in Bcl-2 expression appears in this context to be a secondary compensatory mechanism to promote survival of the remaining cardiomyocytes.",

Reperfusion of ischaemic tissues is a consistent aim of clinical therapies. However, as Parks and Granger102 showed, reperfusion is a double-edged sword which can exacerbate the initial hypoxic injury. Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, NO, hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxides and the hydroxyl radical generated in excess during IR injury can subject a cell to oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis. 103 In addition to the reactive oxygen species, other elements of the reperfusion injury which are known to cause apoptosis include alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis, 43, '\u00b04 an inflammatory reactiontr\" and increased mechanical stretch.'\u00b0' The presence of similar mediators in other contexts leads on to a potential role for apoptosis in mediating some of the clinically relevant effects of local and systemic IR injury, as well as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The synergistic dual effect produced under such circumstances results in initial vascular endothelial damage and ultimately end organ injury. An analogous situation occurs in the failing myocardium where reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines, NO, hypoxia, reperfusion and mechanical stretch exert pro-apoptotic influences upon the endothelium and cardiomyocyte. \"\"\u00b07 Autopsy studies of post-myocardial infarction patients, who had initially successful thrombolysis and therefore a patent infarct-related artery, showed a clear subset of cardiomyocytes dying by apoptosis as a result of IR. 108 This finding is also seen in experimental animal models of IR. `4 Because apoptosis after infarction is an energy-dependent process relying on circulatory nutrient supply, it will occur primarily in reperfused or watershed areas of the infarct. 21 Studies have shown that myocardial apoptosis does not occur in purely ischaemic areas, but will occur upon reperfusion of these areas. 14 Therefore, while one may attempt to deal with an atherosclerotic thrombus after the event occurs, acute apoptotic cardiomyocyte death, while it may be prompted, begins when flow is partially or fully restored. Therefore, reperfusion by recanalisation, thrombolysis or angioplasty provides a window from which time onwards the contribution of apoptotic cell death to the pathological process is potentially amenable to attenuation.",

In a rat model of pressure overload, the secondary cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling was initiated by a wave of apoptotic cardiomyocyte death, thus implicating apoptosis in the pathogenesis of these events.\" Leri et al' `4 have suggested a mechanism whereby myocyte stretch-induced autocrine release of angiotensin II is associated with activation of p53, thus resulting in prolonged upregulation of myocyte apoptosis. This suggestion was reinforced by Kajstura et al\"' who noted an increased incidence of apoptosis after treatment of isolated adult cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II. Furthermore, in myocytes subjected to stretch, the bcl-2 to bax ratio was lowered, thus increasing myocyte apoptotic susceptibility. 118 Thus, the possibility arises that apoptosis may be involved in the pathogenesis of overall cardiac remodelling. 13 ' Postmortem examination studies of human hearts 10 days post-myocardial infarction showed an incidence of apoptosis of 0.7% in areas distant from the infarct. There was no apoptosis in control non-infarcted hearts.\u00a2 This study implicates apoptosis in a wider myocardial role, not limited to just the infarcted or hypoxic area. The ventricular myocardial adaptation and remodelling that occurs in response to pathological stimuli, while it may be compensatory in the short term, may initiate changes leading ultimately to pump failure.

However, the total number of cells present after such injury is typically maximal at two weeks.'\" The rate-limiting factor in this context is smooth muscle cell deletion by apoptosis, which intercedes to control cell numbers. 15 The inference, therefore, is that this apoptotic control allows neointimal thickness to remain constant despite a continued smooth muscle cell proliferation response to injury. 13 ' Pearlman et al showed that extensive apoptosis is detectable in an animal model of intimal injury as early as 30 minutes post-injury. However, no apoptosis was seen in normal vessels.82 In neointimal hyperplasia, proto-oncogene controls of apoptosis act as molecular thermostats balancing cell death versus proliferation, which determines cell numbers and survival. 81 Apoptosis is observed more frequently in restenotic than primary atherosclerotic lesions.2\u00b0 This is again consistent with the dynamic interaction of cell proliferation and apoptosis exerting homeostatic control on cell numbers in the context of endothelial repair and remodelling. This increased frequency of apoptosis in restenotic rather than primary atherosclerotic lesions is supported by autopsy reports of patients dying after multiple angioplasty procedures.\"' Studies of specimens obtained by percutaneous transluminal atherectomy have provided further evidence of hyperplasia being homeostatically counterbalanced by apoptosis, with both elements being more prominent in restenotic lesions.-\u00b0, 3'- An even greater frequency of smooth muscle cell proliferalion and apoptosis is seen in neointimal hyperplasia complicating stent restenosis. 20,138 . 148 The combined significance of these observations is that if apoptosis can be upregulated within these lesions, then the homeostatic mechanisms will dampen down the excessive proliferation of smooth muscle cells.

These modulations are used by neoplastic and viral infected cells to promote their own survival. However, in the context of cardiovascular apoptotic cell -death, similar manipulations have the potential to be used to induce favourable clinical outcomes. Genetic transfers of particular cellular profiles of proto-oncogene expression, such as bcl-2 and p53, hold the potential to suppress undesirable apoptosis in cardiac ischaemia or to beneficially promote apoptosis in neointimal hyperplasia.",

The clinical syndromes produced by these influences have established apoptotic contributions to their pathogenesis and significance.
