In sepsis and other pathological conditions, bacterial lipopolysaccharide endotoxin can induce alveolar macrophages (AM) to release proinflammatoPy cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6. Studying the mechanisms that control alveolar maerophage cytokine production may lead to better therapies for conditions involving inflammatory lung injmy. We and others have noted significant differences between alveolar macrophages and peritoneal macrophages, but large numbers of human or murine alveolar macrophages are rarely available for detailed mechanistic studies. We have obtained three routine alveolar macrophage cell lines (AMJ2C8, AMJ2C11, and AMJ2C20) and have begun to characterize their cytokine responses to proinflammatory stimuli. We measmed the effects of endotoxin, interferon gamma, and the combination of the two on production of tumor necrosis factm, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6 in each line. We also studied the expression of the endotoxin receptor CD14 by these cells, and investigated the effect of serum on their endotoxin responsiveness. We show here that all three of the cell lines responded in a manner comparable to that of primary murine alveolar maerophages. Observed variations between these lines may reflect the documented heterogeneity seen in populations of primary alveolar maerophages. These cell lines should expand the repertoire of tools available to investigators studying regulation of murine alveolar maerophage responses.",

            "text": "Our interest in studying posttranseriptional regulatory mechanisms of TNF production in AM led us to obtain three mouse AM lines recently described by Palleroni et al.: AMJ2C8, AMJ2C 11, and AMJ2C20 (19) . These cell lines had been produced by immortalizing primary AM from C57BL/6J mice with the J2 retrovims, a recombinant virus carrying the v-rafand v-myc oncogenes (3) . In the report describing the creation of these lines, some aspects of proinflammatory cytokine production were characterized for AMJ2Cll (19) . Unlike primary AM, AMJ2Cll were reported to require both interferon-T (IFN-3') and LPS stimulation for induction of TNF and IL-1. This characteristic suggested to us a potentially interesting defect in the posttranscriptional regulation of these eytokines (2). When we sought to reproduce the dual LPS and IFN-7 requirement, we employed a range of LPS concentrations, without IFN-y, and then combined the maximum LPS concentration with 100 U/ml IFN-7. In contrast to the earlier report (19) , we found that all three of the AM cell lines could produce TNF and IL-I[3 mRNA as early as 3 h after challenge with 10 gg/ml LPS alone, suggesting that these lines eould produce proinflammatory eytnkines without eostimulation by IFN-y (23) . We extended our study to characterize these AM lines and their production of TNK IL-1]3, and IL-6 following stimulation with LPS and/or IFN-y, their TNF production in response to varying concentrations of LPS with and without serum, and their eonstitutive ex-pression of the membrane LPS receptor, CD14 (mCD14) (33) . Our results indicate that these cell lines respond comparably to primary AM, including displaying some variation from one another. They should expand the repertoire of tools available to investigators studying regulation of AM responses.",

Results represent the mean -+ standard error (SE). Data were analyzed using Statview Student, a statistical analysis software package (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Analysis of variance, followed by multiple comparison analysis was performed. Dunnett's t-test was used to compare cytokine production by treated cells with untreated control cells. Fisher's exact test was used for multiple comparisons between cells treated with LPS, IFN-?, or both. Statistical significance was taken as P < 0.05.",

We used an ELISA that was over 500 times more sensitive (limit of 15 pg/ml) than the TNF LM cell cytotoxicity bioassay of the prior study (limit of 8000 pg/ml) (15) . Additionally, our culture conditions differed. We stimulated 5.9 X 10 ~ AMJ2Cll cells with up to 10 ~tg/ml LPS, for 24 h, whereas the other study utilized five times as much LPS to stimulate 25-fold fewer cells for twice as long. The much higher LPS exposure could easily have been toxic (16) . By trypan blue exclusion, we observed a 30% loss of viability among AMJ2C8 cells treated with 10 ~tg/ml LPS for 48 h. When Palleroni et al. decreased the LPS concentration to 5 ~g/ml in conjunction with 50 U/ml IFN-T, they did see induetion of both IL-1 and TNE Probably a combination of these factors (potentially toxic LPS concentration, lower cell uumbers, and a less sensitive assay) explain the discrepancy between our results concerning TNF and IL-113 production and those of the previous report (19) .",

Binding is thought to trigger a cascade of events leading to the activation of protein kinase C, the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and then to activation of transcription factors including nuclear factor kappa B (NFrcB), and, uhimately, production of cytokines (5, 10, 17, 28, 29, 31, 33) .

One of the cell lines we tested, AMJ2C20, shared this trait.

The three murine AM cell lines reflected this property: IL-113 was undetectable in any of the culture supernatants, and present at low levels in lysates of unstimulated cells (Fig. 4) . Two of the lines, AMJ2C8 and AMJ2C20, when treated with LPS, produced IL-113 in amounts comparable to those reported for human primary AM (approximately 1 ng/10 \u00a2 ceils) (6).",

Interestingly, we found that IFN-7 can influence the cytokine responses to LPS differently in each line. Variation was noted in the original report concerning these cells (19) , and probably reflects the situation of normal AM in the lung. It is well known that macrophages from diverse anatomical sites are distinct (21, 24) . Others have pointed out that additional heterogeneity exists within macrophage populations in a single site. More than 10 yr ago, Murphy and Herscowitz reported functional variability and subpopulations at differing stages of maturity among AM isolated from rabbits (18) . From analyzing TNF production by individual porcine AM treated with LPS or phorbol ester, Taylor and colleagues have more recently shown that particulm\" smaU subsets of AM respond to distinct stimuli (27) , Thus, the variations observed with these AM cell lines most likely reflect the heterogeneity of the original pool of primary cells from which they were derived.",
