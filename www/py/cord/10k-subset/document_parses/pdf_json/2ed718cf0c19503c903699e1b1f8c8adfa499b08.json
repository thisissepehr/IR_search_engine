To prevent the occurrence of medication errors in clinical practice, safety concerns may be included in the risk management plan and subsequently be addressed with routine and/or additional risk minimisation measures. Objective This study aims to describe safety concerns around medication errors and the risk minimisation measures for centrally authorised products in the European Union. Methods All safety concerns included in the risk management plans of originator centrally authorised products, authorised between 1 January, 2010 and 31 December, 2017, were collected from the European Public Assessment Report registry. Medication error safety concerns were categorised by Anatomical Therapeutic Classification code, year of authorisation, type of medication error and type of risk minimisation measure. Results During the study period, 311 centrally authorised products were approved, of which 84 had at least one medication error safety concern. The proportion of centrally authorised products with medication error safety concerns showed variation between 2010 and 2017 ranging from 15.2% to 36.4%. In total, 95 medication error safety concerns were identified. The type of medication error was highly variable, drug administration error was listed most frequently (n = 17). For 27 out of 95 medication error safety concerns, corresponding to 23 centrally authorised products, additional risk minimisation measures were required. All additional risk minimisation measures consisted of educational material targeted at healthcare professionals (85.2%) and/or patients (51.9%). For 78.3% of centrally authorised products with additional risk minimisation measures for medication errors, studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the additional risk minimisation measures were agreed upon. Conclusions Medication error safety concerns were listed for almost a quarter of centrally authorised products approved during the study period. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and continued need for additional risk minimisation measures for medication errors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Over a quarter of medicines authorised in the European Union have medication errors as an important risk included in the risk management plan.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Medication errors frequently require additional risk minimisation measures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of measures implemented to minimise the risk of medication errors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The online version of this article (https ://doi.org/10.1007/s4026 4-019-00874 -7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In November 1999, the US Institutes of Medicine released a report titled \"To err is human\", which concluded that between 44,000 and 98,000 patients in the USA died each year as a result of preventable medical errors [1] . Varying numbers of patients experiencing medication errors (MEs) have been described. In a recent report, the World Health Organization has marked MEs as a leading cause of avoidable harm to patients [2] . Medication errors are \"an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient\" [3] . Numerous heterogeneous factors have been described as a cause for the occurrence of MEs, ranging from e.g., phonetic (sound-a-like) and orthographic (look-a-like) medication names to confusion relating to appropriate dosage and route of administration to time pressure on medical personnel [4] . In view of the many different factors associated with MEs, reducing the risk of MEs by one single intervention is often not achievable. In addition, many stakeholders such as pharmaceutical companies, regulators, healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients and their caretakers have a role in the prevention of MEs. Therefore, strategies to minimise MEs should include all stakeholders and the need to address the different causes and phases of product development and the post-licensure treatment process. Pharmaceutical companies, responsible for product development and design, should consider possibilities to minimise MEs as early as possible in the development process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 219, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 422, "end": 425, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 572, "end": 575, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 868, "end": 871, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "If MEs are identified during the clinical development phase, these should preferably be resolved before the medicine enters the market. For example, if reconstitution and preparation of the final product are complicated and pose challenges already in the strictly controlled environment of the clinical trial, the pharmaceutical company should improve product preparation, whenever feasible, because the risk in daily practice might be even larger. In 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released guidance describing common areas of risks to be considered by industry and regulators before authorisation [5, 6] . It is highlighted here that the focus regarding MEs should not only be on withinproduct risks but also between-product risks, such as name similarity with already licensed products. In the European Union (EU), the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use Name Review Group evaluates the similarity of new product names with already approved products to limit confusion between products [7] . Despite pre-marketing efforts, not all ME risks can be completely eliminated, e.g., if multiple strengths of the same product are on the market there will be the potential for confusion between strengths. Routine risk minimisation through warnings and instructions in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and patient leaflet, or colour coding of the product name or dosages on packaging may be sufficient to minimise the risk of MEs. If routine measures are not expected to be sufficient to minimise the risk of MEs, additional risk minimisation measures (aRMMs) should be implemented.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 610, "end": 613, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 614, "end": 616, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1014, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Since 2012, an EU Risk Management Plan (EU-RMP) is mandatory for all medicinal products newly licensed in the EU.

The high rate of products with ME safety concerns in this period may be due to several reasons. First, this high rate of products may reflect a high awareness of the seriousness and importance of MEs and the need to minimise these risks [5, 6] . In recent years, several actions have been taken by the EMA to increase awareness of MEs and to provide tools to reduce the risk of MEs, e.g. a stakeholder workshop on MEs, a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use opinion paper and release of two good practice guides (one on recording, coding, reporting and assessment of MEs, and one on risk minimisation and prevention of MEs) [3, 6, 19] . Second, it is also possible that this high proportion is owing to the authorisation of products with high complexity in reconstitution and/or administration. It has been reported that products for intravenous use are associated with the highest complexity and highest risk of harm [20] . In addition, it has been reported that intravenous administration leads to the most serious outcomes from MEs [21] . This is in line with our data where we observed that more than half the CAPs with ME safety concerns were injections and infusions, or other specialised pharmaceutical products such as implants Fig. 3 Number and types of additional risk minimisation measures (aRMM). Who is targeted by educational material? All products with aRMM utilised either educational material (EM) for patients, healthcare professionals (HCPs) or for both. CA controlled access, CD controlled distribution or sealants. An example of an injectable is an insulin product, for which specific RMMs and guidance to minimise the risk of MEs have been developed [22] . Another important finding is the fact that a large proportion of ME safety concerns was only described in the EPAR as medication errors, without indicating the exact type of ME. Moreover, less than 10% of ME safety concerns specified the clinical consequence of the ME. However, it is preferable to include the undesirable clinical outcomes as a consequence of the ME in the EPAR in addition to the ME itself. Further, clearer descriptions of the type of ME and its consequences could aid in the development of more tailored RMMs and better identification of the target population for these RMMs. For example, a safety concern as included in the Lixiana \u00ae (edoxaban) RMP (bleeding due to inappropriate administration) specifies what the cause is for the ME and the clinical consequences of the error. As the current good pharmacovigilance practices Module V revision 2 states the RMP \"should address only the risks that are undesirable clinical outcomes \u2026 [which] \u2026 may be linked to situations such as \u2026 medication errors\", the consequences of MEs may be better described in the future [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 392, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 393, "end": 395, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 786, "end": 789, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 790, "end": 792, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 793, "end": 796, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1201, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1838, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2927, "end": 2931, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1398, "end": 1404, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A third important finding is that the most common ME safety concerns are related to incorrect administration of medication. Different ME safety concerns were found in medicines of all ATC classes (see the ESM), and it did not appear that specific errors were identified more often in certain ATC classes. Although some errors were very specific, e.g. multiple use of medicines intended for single use only, others were more general, e.g. administration errors.

Additional risk minimisation measures were required for almost three-quarters of the ME safety concerns classified as important identified risks.

In cases where the intended benefits of the product outweigh the risks or there is an unmet medical need, appropriate measures should be taken to further minimise the risk of MEs in the post-marketing setting.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Fifth, when ME safety concerns were classified as important potential risks, mainly routine RMMs were used to address these potential risks. Medication error safety concerns classified as important identified risks received aRMMs more often compared to ME safety concerns classified as important potential risks. This suggests that the certainty of the ME risk is a determinant for the necessity of an aRMM. In addition, we observed that ME safety concerns were more often addressed with aRMMs than all other safety concerns of the products. This is in line with recently published data showing that MEs are among the safety concerns with the highest proportion of aRMMs [13, 14] . An explanation for the higher proportion of aRMMs for ME safety concerns compared to all other safety concerns could lie in the difference in preventability. Non-ME safety concerns are often adverse drug reactions that are intrinsic properties of the medicine and are therefore not always preventable in all patients. In contrast, MEs are in theory preventable for all patients and may benefit more directly from aRMMs. This is reflected by the fact that aRMMs were often implemented for risks associated with administration or handling of the product. Educational material for this type of error often consists of a leaflet for HCPs, patients or carers with further instructions on how to handle, prepare and administer the product. The fact that all aRMMs always consist of educational material is in line with previous findings [13, 14] . This is understandable as it is a useful tool to create awareness of risks among HCPs and/or patients, before taking more restrictive measures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 671, "end": 675, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 676, "end": 679, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1517, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1521, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, we found that for 78% of products with aRMMs for ME safety concerns, studies were in place to measure the effectiveness of these measures. The effectiveness of educational materials is debated and the materials may not always have the intended effect [23] . Effectiveness studies are important to decide whether RMMs are adequate or should be amended, although the execution often remains a challenge [24] [25] [26] . As the aRMMs discussed in this study are implemented at the time of the product approval, a comparison between before and after implementation of the aRMM is not feasible in these cases. Studies focus mainly on the observed rate of MEs after marketing. When using spontaneous reports for this purpose, underreporting is a known problem [27] . Identifying the occurrence of MEs may also be a challenge when existing electronic healthcare databases are used because particular errors (e.g. administration errors) can be difficult to identify in such data. Surveys to investigate whether HCPs understand the material may be biased, as HCPs who are more aware of the educational material may be more inclined to participate in such a survey [28] . In addition, it is possible that those who read the material, but also experienced the ME, are less likely to participate because of social desirability bias. We observed that noninterventional observational studies, analysis of spontaneous reporting data and surveys were most frequently used for evaluation of the effectiveness of RMMs for MEs. Despite the challenges, these may be the most feasible tools currently available for measuring MEs in real life. The advantage of spontaneous reporting data is that they can describe a wide variety of errors. However, better methods are needed to study MEs in real life. Improvement may be sought in the application of already available digital tools (e.g. bar-code scanning).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 264, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 410, "end": 414, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 415, "end": 419, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 420, "end": 424, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1168, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study did not investigate the effectiveness of the RMMs. We observed that for most CAPs in our dataset, studies to assess the effectiveness of aRMMs for MEs were agreed upon.

A review of MEs and their RMMs may support regulators and biopharmaceutical medicine developers in future decision making and product development. Our study also has some limitations. The data collected in our study are based on EPAR documents publicly available on the EMA website. As these documents contain summarised information, data may be missing, e.g. the complete overview of routine RMMs. For example, it is not always described whether packaging and labelling is used to minimise the risk of ME. Therefore, this variable is not included in the study. This may have resulted in an underestimation of the efforts to prevent MEs. In addition, details of the studies that are planned to evaluate the effectiveness of risk minimisation are not always clearly presented in the EPAR. Availability of the complete EU-RMP in the public domain could improve data analysis. The lack of information in the EPAR was dealt with by investigating the original EU-RMPs for products with ME safety concerns identified form the EPAR where there was missing data. Another limitation of our study is that we only included products that had ME safety concerns at the moment of authorisation; therefore, we could not address MEs that were identified later in the product cycle. Our study only focused on risk minimisation of MEs in the EU. Other approaches to minimise the risk of MEs may exist in other areas and a comparison of approaches between different agencies is worth investigating.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strengths and Limitations"}, {"text": "Our study shows that over a quarter of medicines authorised in the EU have MEs as a safety concern in the EU-RMP.
