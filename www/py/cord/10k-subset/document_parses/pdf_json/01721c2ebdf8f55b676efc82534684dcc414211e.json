To better understand the impact of severe illness on the amino acid economy and nutritional needs of pediatric patients, we studied plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine kinetics in eleven critically ill patients (six fullterm newborns and five young infants). Within 4 8 h of the diagnosis of sepsis they were given primed constant i.v. infusions of L-11-'\"]phenylalanine and 1,-13,3,~II~]tyrosine for 4 h. Routine nutritional support continued during this period by parenteral administration of destrose, lipid emulsion, and an amino acid mixture low in tyrosine. Phenylalanine and tyrosine fluses and rate of phenylalanine hydrosylation did not differ significantly between the two age groups, and so the data were combined for evaluation. For the entire group, values (pmol. kg-'. h-'; mean 2 SD) for phenylalanine and tyrosine fluses and rate of phenylalanine hydrosylation were 132 5 24, 66 2 16, and 29 2 12, respectively. Plasma phenylalanine to tyrosine concentration ratio was 1.67 +. 0.6. From a comparison of the rate of phenylalanine hydroxylation with measured phenylalanine intakes, it was concluded that their routine, clinical nutritional support was inadequate to achieve body phenylalanine balance. In comparison with published data, the relative rate of phenylalanine hydrosylation appears to be high. \\Ye speculate that tyrosine is a conditionally indispensable amino acid under these conditions; it would be desirable to establish the intake levels and ratio of phenylalanine to tyrosine that effectively support aromatic amino acid balance in these critically ill patients. (Pediatr Res 35: 580-588, 1994) Adequate nutritional support ofcritically ill patients represents an essential component of medical care (1, 2). with well-nourished patients having better outcome and a shorter hospital stay (3, 4) . Although current nutritional regimens provided to critically ill children are based largely on the nutritional requirements for healthy children (5, 6) , these patients are often hypermetabolic and show profound changes in the pattern of energy substrate and amino acid use. It is likely that more effective nutritional therapies will evolve after a better understanding of the quantitative changes in nutrient metabolism, and the mechanisms responsible for them, under these disease conditions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1616, "end": 1634, "text": "35: 580-588, 1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1830, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1833, "text": "4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1984, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1985, "end": 1987, "text": "6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In this study we examined plasma kinetics of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism in critically ill neonates and infants with sepsis.

For example, phenylalanine fluxes in our critically ill infants are considerably higher than those reported for normal babies (7) . Furthermore, the flux ratio of phenylalanine to tyrosine was higher in our infants than in the normally growing newborns studied by Denne cf 01. (7) . This finding is consistent with previous reports (35) showing an increased plasma phenylalanine/tyrosine concentration ratio in patients for the fasted state and 86 + 13, 46 + 8, and 10 + 3 (mean + SD; pmol. kg-'.h-I), respectively, for the fed state. These invcstigators used [?H5]phenylalanine and ['H2]tyrosine as tracers. Thus, phenylalanine fluxes are higher in our patients with sepsis when compared with the healthy newborns, as might be anticipated for a hypermetabolic, catabolic condition. When the intravenously administered phcnylalanine intake is subtracted from phenylalanine flux, the \"corrected,\" mean phenylalanine flux is 115 f 24 pmol. kg-'. h-', remaining higher than that in healthy newborns (7) . This correction for i.v. intake of phenylalanine is necessary, particularly because Wykes ct a/. (31) found that phenylalanine flux was greatly affected by the parentcral phcnylalanine supplied. Tyrosine fluxes in our group of critically ill infants with sepsis were similar or perhaps somewhat higher than those in healthy neonates (7), who were also receiving no tyrosine by i.v. feeding. Also, the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, expressed either as an absolute rate or as a percentage of the phenylalanine flux, was higher in our patients than was phenylalanine hydroxylation in newborn infants as reported by Denne with sepsis, suggesting a n increased rate of muscle breakdown, reduced rate of incorporation of phenylalanine into muscle proteins, and/or a n alteration in the rate of hepatic conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine (26, 27, 35, 36) . Also, during protein deficiency, phenylalanine use decreases, leading to a relative increase in the plasma phenylalanine level, which again is possibly due to a decreased enzymatic conversion of phcnylalanine to tyrosine (37, 38) . Of course, the low content of tyrosine in the parenteral amino acid mixture would also be expected to raise the plasma-free phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio, although the ratio was also high in the two patients (patients 4 and 9) who were receiving glucose alone. This finding suggests a n altered aromatic amino acid homeostasis in our patients and possibly a change in the coupling between phenylalanine kinetics, hydroxylation, and tyrosine balance and oxidation. We speculate that because of the stressful or catabolic state combined with the low tyrosine intake, an impaired balance exists among phenylalanine retention, hydroxylation, and tyrosine homeostasis in these patients with sepsis. Thus, phenylalanine hydyroxylation rates may be adaptively increased in these patients but with the net effects of impairing phenylalanine balance and inadequately meeting the metabolic needs for tyrosine. It is not unusual for critically ill patients with sepsis to develop supranormal values of physiologic parameters such as cardiac output or oxygen delivery that are still insufficient to meet their needs (39) . We speculate that a similar situation may occur at the metabolic level, whereby multiple factors, such as increased protein breakdown and changes in the pattern of amino acid utilization and requirements, lead to increased rates of phenylalanine hydroxylation that are still insufficient to meet the tyrosine requirements. This hypothesis will need to be verified in follow-up investigations in which different intakes and ratios of phenylalanine and tyrosine intake are examined for their effects on phenylalanine and tyrosine kinetics. Alternatively, the altered rates of phenylalanine hydroxylation and their relationships to phenylalanine kinetics and intake might be a more general reflection of an impairment and changes in amino acid catabolism, which frequently occurs in sick and stressed patients (40, 4 1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 404, "end": 407, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 555, "end": 558, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 610, "end": 614, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1277, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1381, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2122, "text": "(26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2123, "end": 2126, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2127, "end": 2130, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2134, "text": "36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2358, "end": 2362, "text": "(37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2363, "end": 2366, "text": "38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3472, "end": 3476, "text": "(39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Table 3.

Indeed, tyrosine may become a \"conditionally\" indispensable amino acid under these circumstances despite an apparently generous supply of phenylalanine. The reason for this is that the formation of tyrosine from phenylalanine occurs principally in the liver, where this tyrosine may or may not be made as easily available in times of metabolic stress as an exogenous source of tyrosine would be for meeting the tyrosine needs of the body organs and tissues. Because of its poor solubility, most parenteral amino acid mixtures contain only a trace of tyrosine, while being designed to provide a generous phenylalanine intake; the assumption here is that the supply of phenylalanine will be sufficient to maintain an adequate availability of tyrosine where it is required. This assumption may be, and probably is, an overly simplistic assessment of phenylalanine-tyrosine interrelationships, particularly if the regulation of tissue and organ pools of phenylalanine and tyrosine occurs by way of separate systems and mechanisms and if these are, in turn, affected differently by stressful stimuli, including infection. Although another commonly used mixture (Trophamine, Kendall-McGaw Laboratories, Irvine, CA), has been supplemented with acetyl-tyrosine, the target intake level has been designed to support plasma amino acids concentrations similar to those observed in healthy full-term, breast-fed, l-moold infants (43, 44) . Although a possibly useful criterion, it is important to assess whether \"normal\" serum values represent an appropriate nutritional goal for the critically ill patients (45, 46) . Current estimates of amino acid requirements in human subjects are based largely on nitrogen balance studies (21) ; in the case of children, these values are supplemented with data from measurements of growth rates in response to specific nutritional treatments (21, 47) . In the case of critically ill neonates and infants, these procedures are not feasible, and we suggest, from the present experience, that application of stable isotope tracer methods might be a useful way to investigate the quantitative requirements for specific amino acids in these patients. Indeed, \"C-enriched amino acid tracers have been used successfully in adults to estimate minimum intakes required to achieve body balance of the irreversible oxidative losses of nutritionally indispensable amino acids (48) . However, we recognize that for critically ill children with mechanically ventilated lungs it might be difficult to obtain accurate measurements of total l'C-labeled C02 and COz production by indirect calorimetry, especially under conditions of the high air flow rates used to meet their ventilatory needs. Measurements of \"C02 in plasma is possible, but precise estimation of rates of total C 0 2 production in these patients remains difficult. For these reasons, we chose to apply the present phenylalanine-tyrosine tracer model as described by Thompson c7t al.
