Instead, there was even a statistically significantly higher rate of respiratory tract colonization in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo group. In the absence of any effect on P. aeruginosa infections, we assume this to be a chance observation, not unlikely given the number of statistical tests. The hypothesis that antibody titers elicited with the IC43 100 \u03bcg vaccine, particularly after the second vaccination, could result in a reduction of P. aeruginosa infections could not be confirmed.

The attributable mortality of P. aeruginosa infection in mechanically ventilated patients is dependent on the severity of illness, susceptibility pattern, and appropriate antibiotic prescription, being estimated to be around 13% [21, 22] . Thus, a 10% reduction in mortality would have been very optimistic, a factor that had been taken into account for the decision to continue. In the second part of the study after the interim analysis, the trend was in fact overturned with higher overall mortality at day 28 in the active treatment group, resulting in an increase of 1.5% when compared to placebo at the final analysis. The absolute mortality rates observed in the interim analysis were well within the 95% CI limits of the mortality rates at the final analysis and were, therefore, not improbable.

Heterogeneity of ICU populations is a recognized factor in interventional trials, and while the eligibility criteria were not altered during the current study, possible selection bias through different regional referral patterns may have led to a broader patient selection or earlier/later intervention. In line with these interpretations, the country of residence was shown to be a significant factor for survival/mortality in several regression models. Choosing a clinical and statistically significant improvement in all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint, which is of course very difficult to reach in clinical trials performed in intensive care patients, as well as the lack of an enrichment strategy in order to include a more selected ICU patient population at higher risk for P. aeruginosa may be considered, retrospectively, very challenging for the design of a study protocol.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 225, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 350, "end": 354, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Interventions to prevent nosocomial infection using a vaccine at the time point of ICU admission may come too late, and potentially, vaccination before admission would allow more time to show an effect.
