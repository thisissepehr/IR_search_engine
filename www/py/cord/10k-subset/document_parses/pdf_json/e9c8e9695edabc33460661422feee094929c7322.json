These sequences were initially selected from the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees if they branched off close to the root between two subtypes and had long branches. There were 655 breakpoint positions recorded among the 209 sequences, with some sequences having more than one breakpoint. These positions were plotted as a frequency plot of breakpoints along the alignment to identify hotspots for recombination (i.e. positions in the alignment were recombination breakpoints occur more frequently than the other positions, Supplementary Fig. S2 ).

To the best of our knowledge, only one previous nationwide molecular epidemiology study from Nigeria have been presented 60 . In this study, 55 HIV-1 gp41 sequences (approximately 400 bp) collected throughout Nigeria during 1999 were analysed by neighbour-joining phylogenetics. However, the analysis was unable to distinguish between subtype A and CRF02_AG sequences -likely due to insufficient phylogenetic information in this relatively short gene fragment, as suggested by the authors. In-depth phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis was therefore not possible in this study. In comparison, we analysed 1442 HIV-1 pol sequences (approximately 1000 bp long) collected throughout Nigeria between 1999 and 2013 using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics. Importantly, the HIV-1 pol gene (which is the most targeted genetic region for HIV-1 sequencing and by far most commonly analysed region in studies of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology) holds sufficient intrinsic genetic variability to permit the reconstruction of transmission histories by phylogenetic approaches 26, 32, 61 . Hence, the larger size of our dataset, the relatively long time-window of sampling, and the use of state-of-the-art phylodynamic methods enabled us to perform the first in-depth nationwide HIV-1 phylodynamic study in Nigeria. In line with other previous studies from different geographic regions in Nigeria, we found that CRF02_AG, CRF43_02G and subtype G were the most prevalent strains (previous estimates ranging www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ from 19-60% for CRF02_AG and 22-50% for subtype G [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 62 ). The prevalence of CRF43_02G has only been reported in one previous study from Abuja (estimated to 19%) 21 . Non-representative sampling or local fluctuations between geographic regions in Nigeria could explain the large variations and discrepancies between studies.

Each of these clusters harbored the majority of Nigerian sequences, suggesting single strain introductions that grew out to dominate the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic. Previous studies have used different nomenclatures of subtype G. A comparison of accession numbers showed that our subtype G cluster is partly consistent with the subtype G' cluster identified by Chaplin et al. 22 . Further dissection of the subtype G' cluster showed that approximately half of the sequences belonged to subtype G, whereas the other half clustered with the CRF43_02G sequences in our analysis. In a more recent study, Delatorre et al. suggested a nomenclature based on geographic dissemination 63 . The clustering pattern of the West African strain defined as subtype G WA-II was largely overlapping with the Nigerian subtype G cluster in our analysis 63 . We estimated the date of origin for the subtype G cluster to 1975 (95%HPD: 1969 -1982 , which is consistent with the origin of the subtype G WA-II cluster that was estimated to 1979 [95%HPD: 1973 -1984 ) 63 . In addition, the estimated date of origin also fits with the fact that the first AIDS cases were identified in Nigeria in 1986, approximately one decade after the introduction of this virus strain 16 . The CRF43_02G was first described and isolated in Saudi Arabia in 2008 64 . Interestingly, the G WA-I cluster determined by Delatorre et al. consisted of 140/168 (83%) sequences from Nigeria 63 . In our analysis, more than half of the G WA-I sequences clustered with the CRF43_02G strain. Spatiotemporal analysis of the G WA-I cluster indicated that this strain emerged in Nigeria in the mid-1970's 63 . This is consistent with our estimate of 1971 (95%HPD: 1952-1983) for the CRF43_02G cluster. Moreover, the majority of CRF43_02G sequences in Genbank are of Nigerian origin (www.hiv.lanl.gov), and both the putative parental strains of CRF43_02G in Nigeria (CRF02_AG and subtype G) are highly prevalent.
