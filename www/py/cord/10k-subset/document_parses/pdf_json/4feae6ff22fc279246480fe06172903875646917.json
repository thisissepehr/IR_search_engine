            "text": "Runners and other exercise enthusiasts are traditionally motivated to participate in sports for competitive or recreational reasons. However, some exerciseparticipants are convinced that exercisewill provide health benefits (Nash 1986 ). Indeed, regular exercise and physical activity have been established as a means of reducing cardiovascular disease risk and contributing to longevity (Paffenbarger et al. 1986; Powell et al. 1987 ). In addition, habitual exercisers often report other health-related rewards from endurance exercise such as weight control (Heath et a1. 1981) , improved energy levels (Hughes 1984) and stress reduction (Blumenthal et al. 1980; Sinyor et al. 1983 ). Many exercisers also believe that exercise improves their resistance to infection and anecdotally report that they have fewer colds and other upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) [Simon 1987 ]. Despite these beliefs, few studies have examined the relationships that exist among exercise and clinical expressions of upper respiratory tract infections. This article seeks to examine the existing studies that have investigated the relationship between exercise and upper respiratory tract infections and to determine ifany such relationship exists. It begins by defining and discussing the specific health outcome of infections and the classification of these diseases. Secondly, the epidemiology and natural history are discussed with the clinical and experimental evi-dence of the relationship between upper respiratory tract infections and exercise explored. The suggested immunological and physiological mechanisms of this possible relationship are examined, followed by a review of the epidemiological data linking an association of exercise to upper respiratory tract infections. Finally, guidelines for the exercising public are presented as an application of our attempt to answer the question : exercise and upper respiratory tract infections -is there a relationship?",

Suspension of viral particles in large droplets produced by a cough or sneeze with direct contact into the eyes or on to the upper respiratory passages is a common mode, usually produced by close contact with the infected individual. Virus suspended in the small particle aerosol of a sneeze or cough is capable of travelling greater distances and is another common mode of infection. Finally, the virus can be spread by contact with contaminated secretions by hand from contaminated surface to mucous membranes (self-inoculation) [Hall & McBride 1989] . For most of the respiratory vi-When examining the numbers and types of viruses causing upper respiratory tract infections it is clear that this is a rather ubiquitous group of infections. In general, the number of infections acquired per year decreases with age (Bader et aL 1953; Brimblecombe et al. 1958; Dingle et al. 1964; Fox et al. 1972; Gwaltney et al. 1966) . Infants and children have the highest incidence with 4 to 8 infections per year. This rate may even double when children are in day care or nursery school. In schoolaged children the incidence is 2 to 6 colds per year (Badger et al. 1953; Brimblecombe et al. 1958; Dingle et al. 1964; Fox et al. 1972) . Adults acquire 2 to 5 upper respiratory tract infections per year, with women and adults who live in households with children tending to suffer even more colds per year (Gwaltney et aL 1966) . Smoking has been shown to aggravate the signs and symptoms of infection but not to increase the attack rate (Gwaltney et al. 1966 (Gwaltney et al. , 1967 . Exposure to cold or to chilling does not increase the chance of acquiring or aggravating a cold (Douglas et al. 1968 ). Recent studies have demonstrated that psychological stress is a risk factor for the development of an upper respiratory tract infection (Cohen et al. 1991; Graham 1986) . Finally, in studies exploring the prophylactic use of vitamin C in prevention, the attack rate of upper respiratory tract infections was not diminished al- Fig. 2 .

            "text": "Several researchers have reported that various aspects of immune function are depressed following intense, prolonged endurance exercise (Nieman & Nehlsen-Cannarella 1991a) . Heavy exertion is a form of physiological stress that causes large increases in epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol levels, hormones which have been consistently associated with a suppression of immune function, and rapid perturbations in circulating levels ofleucocyte and lymphocyte subsets. Nieman et al. (1989a) and Berk et al. (1990) ran 10 seasoned marathoners at their fastest marathon pace on treadmills for 3 hours. Cortisol rose 59% abo ve baseline levels after the 3-hour run , remain-ing elevated for 1.5 hours of recovery before falling to normal daytime levels. This increase in cortisol correlated inversely with a 25 to 46% decrease in natural killer (NK) cell activity at 1.5 hours after recovery, which persisted for nearly 6 hours ( fig.  1 ). Pedersen et al. (1988 Pedersen et al. ( , 1989 Pedersen et al. ( , 1990 and Kappel et al. (1991) have carefully demonstrated that the post exercise suppression of natural killer cell activity is also related to increased levels of prostaglandins released from monocytes. Eskola et al. (1978) and Gmunder et al. (1988) have reported a significant decrease in lymphocyte proliferative response for several hours after a marathon (42.2km) [ fig. 2 ]. MacNeil et al. (1991) have demonstrated that the lymphocyte proliferative response is decreased for at least 2 hours following cycle ergometer exercise, especially following high intensity exercise by athletes. Following 1 hour of cycling at 80% V02max by untrained individuals, Tvede et al. (1989) found suppression of B lymphocyte function for at least 2 hours because of an inhibitory effect of activated monocytes. have determined that neutrophil killing capacity is decreased in elite athletes engaging in prolonged periods of intensive tra ining in comparison to untrained controls. Nieman et al. (1989b) and have reported significantly lower serum complement in long distance runners relative to sedentary controls. A significant decrease in salivary immunoglobulin concentrations following 2 hours of intense cycling or 50km of cross-country ski racing z 20 10 has been described by 2 groups of investigators (Mackinnon et al. 1987; Tomasi et al. 1982) . Israel et al. (1982) have reported that serum immunoglobulins fall 10 to 28% for at least 1 day after athletes run 45 or 75km at high intensity. Russian investigators have related that exhaustion of immune reserves can be observed during periods of important competitions, manifested by lowered immunoglobulin levels and suppression of phagocytic activity ofneutrophils (Pershin et al. 1985; Petrova et al. 1983 Petrova et al. , 1985 .",

Lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages are attracted to the injured muscle cells, and invade the area to aid in the process. Neutrophils phagocytise tissue debris and release a wide variety of factors that aid in the digestion of adjacent dead tissue cells (Smith 1991) . Macrophages have surface receptors which allow them to react nonspecifically to a variety of substances, a process enhanced by the presence of opsonins (primarily complement and antibody). Macrophages also are a prime source of cytokines that mediate most of the physiological and inflammatory reactions accompanying muscle cell injury. Dufaux and Order (1989b) have shown that plasma elastase-a j-antitrypsin, neopterin, tumour necrosis factor and soluble interleukin-2 receptor increase during recovery from a 2.5-hour running test, supporting the concept of a functional involvement of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and an activation of macrophages .and T-lymphocytes. Dufaux and Order (1989a) have also provided evidence for complement activation after 2.5 hours of running.",

Both of these hormones have been associated with many negative effects on immune function (Cavallo et al. 1986; Crary et al. 1983; Cupps & Fauci 1982) . Lymphocytes have~-adren ergic receptors, and the presence of epinephrine during exercise increases receptor number on T suppressor/cytotoxic and natural killer cells, which are the major lymphocyte subsets that increase in response to an exercise challenge (Field et al. I991; Maisel et at. 1990; Van Tits et at. 1990 ). The degree to which these lymphocyte subsets increase in the peripheral blood as they are recruited from lymphoid tissue pools is highly dependent on the magnitude of change in epinephrine.

Thus , it may be argued that moderate exercise induces a small increase in natural killer cells and T cytotoxic/suppressor cells without the potential suppressive effect of epinephrine or cortisol, creating a milieu which may be favourable for host protection. There is only a finite number of lymphocytes that is specific to any particular antigen. Theoretically, by recruiting lymphocytes from the periphery, exercise may increase the rate of lymphocyte circulation through the body, improving the potential for interaction of lymphocyte and antigen without the attending negative effects of stress hormones (Nieman & Nehlsen-Cannarella 1992) . 3 ]. Moderate exercise training led to a 20% net increase in each of the 3 serum immunoglobulins, and was significantly correlated with fewer respiratory infection symptoms days (Nieman & Nehlsen-Cannarella 1991 b) . Moderate exercise training also led to a significant increase in natural killer cell activity which was correlated with a decrease in the duration of respiratory infection symptoms per episode. These results are similar to those of Crist et al. (1989) who moderately exercised elderly women for 16 weeks and measured a 33% higher natural killer cell activity at rest, and a heightened increase following maximal testing. Laboratory and clinical studies suggest that changes in immune parameters associated with heavy train ing lead to adverse health effects, par- ticularly an increase in the incidence or severity of upper respiratory tract infections. However, anecdotal reports by marathon runners that running increased (or decreased) their incidence of upper respiratory tract infections were not correlated with immune system changes (Green et al. 1981) . If the documented changes in immune parameters are associated with upper respiratory tract infections, there are several methods by which epidemiological investigations can be used to evaluate this effect.",

Peters and Bateman (1983) studied the incidence of respiratory tract infections in 1550 randomly selected runners who took part in a 56km race compared with matched controls who did not run. Those who ran the race reported more symptoms of respiratory tract infections during the 2week period following the race than those who did not run, and those who ran the faster race times reported more symptoms, indicating a doseresponse relationship. Nieman et al. (l990b) studied the incidence of respiratory tract infection in a large group of marathon runners who varied widely in running ability and training habits. Those who ran the marathon reported more symptoms during the week following the race than similarly experienced runners who had applied but did not participate in the race for Sports Medicine 14 (6) 1992 possible confounders, the researchers concluded that, compared with nonrunners, runners experience increased risk for respiratory tract infection during heavy training or following a marathon race event. Heath et al. (1991) followed a cohort of 530 runners who self-reported any symptoms of respiratory infections daily for 1 year. The average runner was about 40 years of age, ran 20 miles (32km) per week, and experienced a rate of 1.2 respiratory infections per year. Controlling for various confounding variables, the lowest odds ratio for respiratory infection was found among those running less than 10 miles (16km) per week. The odds ratio more than doubled for those running more than 17 miles (27km) per week. The authors concluded that running mileage was a significant risk factor for upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.",

These results persisted after controlling for total training mileage and percentage increase in training mileage during the month before the race. Nieman et al. (l989c) studied the incidence of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms among participants in 5km, IOkm and half-marathon road races. During the 2 months before the race, those running more than 15 miles (24km) per week reported more events than those running fewer miles. There was no increase in symptoms after the road race compared with the week before the road race, indicating that the race did not appear to be associated with an increased risk of acute upper respiratory tract infection.",

In both conditions, the number of circulating leucocytes increases, lymphopenia occurs (especially T cells with cells trafficking to peripheral tissues), the lymphocyte responses to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin (Con-A) decrease, body core temperature rises, plasma levels of acute phase proteins increase and degranulation of neutrophils develops. Since endurance exercise is associated with muscle cell damage and an increased intake of potential pathogens through heightened ventilation, it is logical that in preparation for such a challenge, the immune system receives a signal from the neuroendocrine network that activates the immune system. Why then do clinical experience and epidemiological data point toward an increased risk of respiratory infection in some athletes? The mass of evidence favours the view that psychosocial variables play an important role in effecting immunological competence. The net effect of combined psychological and physiological stress from unusually heavy endurance exercise, especially during times of competition, may lead to suppression or down-regulation of the immune system.",

Mild exercise during sickness with the common cold does not appear to be contraindicated. However, if there are symptoms or signs of systemic involvement (e.g. fever, extreme fatigue, muscle aches, swollen lymph glands), then 2 to 4 weeks should be allowed before resumption of more intense training.

Clinical studies examining the effects of moderate levels of physical activity have shown possible enhanced immune responses with a concomitant impact on the length and severity of an upper respiratory tract infection.

However, since avoidance of a high risk situation, such as the presence of children, is often difficult, the hygienic measures of frequent handwashing and the thorough washing of potential fomitic surfaces will aid in reducing exposure to the upper respiratory tract infection agent. For those athletes who are required to engage in high intensity training and competition, further steps should be taken to minimise contact with situations where exposure to upper respiratory tract infection agents is high. In addition, training techniques should take into consideration the need for the organism to restore host resistance by including lower intensity training sandwiched between higher intensity training bouts.",
