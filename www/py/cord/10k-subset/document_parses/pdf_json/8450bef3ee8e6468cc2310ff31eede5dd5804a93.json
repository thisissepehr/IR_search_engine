The ability of type I IFN to inhibit HIV replication and the possibility to manipulate pDC responses have been a fertile ground for supporting potential therapeutic approaches aimed at taking advantage of this natural antiviral system. However, whilst therapies based on the antiviral activity of type I IFN proved to be efficacious in the treatment of other viral infections, their impact on the course of HIV disease has been minimal. Novel approaches are now being considered in light of the improved understanding of HIV pathogenesis. In particular, consideration is being given to the possibility that pDC and type I IFN may contribute to sustain the status of chronic activation, which eventually results in the dismay of the immune system [22] .

Obstruction of HIV replication by type I IFN appears to occur at different stages of the viral cycle, with effects which may be specific for certain cell types [24] . Thus, the general antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect of type I IFN are only partially responsible for their anti-HIV activity. Of particular interest is the fact that monocytes/macrophages respond to type I IFN by upregulating and activating the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzymecatalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), an intracellular enzyme that exerts potent antiretroviral activity [25] . APOBEC3G blocks HIV replication prior to integration of the proviral DNA into the target cell's genome [26] , but its induction by type I IFN is not observed in CD4 T-cell lines [27] . The cell-specific induction pattern of APOBEC3G may partially explain why type I IFN primarily inhibits the assembly and release of HIV in chronically-infected CD4 T cells [24, 28] , whilst reducing the relative levels of viral RNA and integrated provirus in macrophages [24, 29, 30] . Recent evidence also suggest that type I IFN may exert anti-HIV activity through inducing tetherin, a molecule which impedes virus release from the cell surface and is antagonized by the HIV accessory protein Vpu [31, 32] .

The interaction of HIV with CD4 expressed on pDC is required to allow its endocytosis and subsequent presentation of the viral nucleic acid to endosmal TLR-7 and -9, essential for pDC activation [35] . The peculiar ability of HIV to interact with CD4, combined with the rapid endocytosis of CD4 by pDC, lead to the suggestion that HIV may provide a particularly strong and protracted trigger for pDC [22] . Recognition of HIV RNA by TLR-7 is probably the main route of HIV-induced pDC activation [35, 36] , but a role for TLR-9 cannot be excluded. pDC from HIV-infected patients are refractory to in vitro re-stimulation with TLR-7 and -9 ligands or with HIV itself, and the frequency of circulating pDC is reduced in peripheral blood during HIV infection [34] . The dynamics of circulating pDC have been described to follow the changes observed in CD4 count during HIV infection. Thus, circulating pDC decrease during primary HIV infection, and this reduction is partially prevented by early HAART [37] . Efficient HAART treatment also recovers the levels of circulating pDC and their responsiveness to TLR stimulation in chronically HIV-infected patients, but not in patients in whom the CD4 count restoration is impaired [38] . Although these observations suggest an impairment of pDC functionality and type I IFN responses during HIV infection, a number of recent reports outlined how the reduction and apparent hyporesponsiveness of circulating pDC are both consequences of chronic HIV-induced hyperactivation. Plasma levels of type I IFN were described to increase rapidly in macaques upon simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection [39, 40] . Abel and colleagues observed that the induction of type I IFN responses occurred early during acute infection and persisted throughout the future science group course of disease [39] . Expression of type I IFN and IFN-inducible genes was observed in different lymphoid tissues, and associated with high tissue SIV RNA rather than control of viral replication [39] . The chronic triggering of pDC may lead to their relocation to lymphoid tissues and to the induction of an apparent refractory status induced through negative feedback [41, 42] . These findings reconcile with earlier observations that the levels of type I IFN and type I IFN-regulated genes, including those associated with apoptotic pathways, are increased in peripheral leukocytes and lymphoid tissues from HIV-infected patients [43] [44] [45] . Therefore, during HIV infection, pDC may be chronically activated rather than hypofunctional, and production of type I IFN chronically induced rather than inhibited. The hypothesis that chronic pDC activation and type I IFN production may play a pivotal role in driving the immune dysfunction observed during HIV infection has brought alternative therapeutic methods to the attention of scientists and clinicians. The possibility that approaches aimed at blocking type I IFN or their signaling pathways may provide an immunologic benefit during HIV infection is supported by animal models showing that the prolonged stimulation of pDC causes dysfunctions similar to those observed in HIV-infected patients [46, 47] . The expression of markers of chronic T-cell activation, considered a hallmark of HIV disease progression, may be at least, in part, dependent on HIV-induced type I IFN [48, 49] , and pDC from SIV natural hosts, which do not develop immunodeficiency and do not show signs of chronic immune activation, produce far less IFN-a/b in response to TLR-7 and -9 stimulation compared with human or macaque pDC [50] . Furthermore, recent evidence from a nonhuman primate study shows that early accumulation of pDC at the initial site of infection in the vaginal mucosa drives the affluence of CCR5 + CD4 T cells, which are targets for SIV infection at this site, ultimately favoring the systemic diffusion of the virus [51] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 332, "end": 336, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 740, "end": 744, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 836, "end": 840, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 841, "end": 844, "text": "36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1100, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1343, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1568, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1986, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1987, "end": 1990, "text": "40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2171, "end": 2175, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2356, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2530, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2531, "end": 2534, "text": "42]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2789, "end": 2793, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2794, "end": 2798, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2799, "end": 2803, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3512, "end": 3516, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3517, "end": 3520, "text": "47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3691, "end": 3695, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3696, "end": 3699, "text": "49]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3924, "end": 3928, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4232, "end": 4236, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Activation of the type I IFN pathway by HIV can occur also through alternative pathways, directly involving gp120 signaling to monocytes/macrophages [52] [53] [54] .

A beneficial effect of IFN-a was immediately recognized in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV patients in whom the number of circulating CD4 T cells was at least partially preserved [60] . By the early 1990s several independent studies indicated IFN-a as an efficient anti-tumor drug in HIV patients with Kaposi's sarcoma who had CD4 counts higher than 200 cells/mm 3 (reviewed in [61] ). The antitumor effect was often associated with a reduction in the circulating levels of HIV p24 antigen (determination of plasma viral RNA by PCR was not yet available), suggesting a partial anti-HIV effect [61] .

In vivo, CpG ODNs were shown to improve vaccine-induced memory T-cell responses, and their application as adjuvants to improve vaccine-induced T-cell responses represents one of their main prospective clinical applications in the setting of HIV infection [73] . Although of interest, these applications inevitably rely on the delivery of an efficient vaccine, which is still not available for HIV. Whether suboptimal vaccine strategies that have already been investigated can be significantly improved by optimizing the adjuvant with which they are paired remains to be determined. A therapeutic approach can be considered based on the potential type I IFN-mediated anti-HIV activity of CpG ODN, as demonstrated for thymic pDC in vitro [74] . CpG ODN were also shown to improve the anti-HIV activity of other effector cells of the innate arm of the immune response. For example, the lysis of infected CD4 T cells by natural killer cells is dependent on type I IFN production by pDC, and is therefore positively affected by CpG ODNs in vitro [75] . A similar application has been proposed for the TLR-7 agonist imiquimod, which was tested in a Phase I study for administration to asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, but did not result in a consistent reduction in viral load, despite increasing circulating levels of type I IFN in all treated patients [76] . The question can be raised as to which advantages and disadvantages the administration of TLR-7 and -9 agonists may have compared with IFN-a/b. Although the proposed therapeutic ability of molecules that stimulate pDC depends largely on the induction of type I IFN production, this approach may have a broader biological effect than the simple use of recombinant or natural IFN-a. Thus, by stimulating pDC, TLR-7 and -9 agonists may promote not only the production of type I IFN, but also the maturation of pDC into effector cells with cytotoxic, antigen presenting and migratory ability [36] . In particular, the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 on activated pDC may contribute to their migration to lymph nodes [77] , which are important reservoirs for HIV [78] . Although many of the phenotypic and functional changes induced by TLR-7 and -9 agonists in pDC depend themselves on type I IFN signaling, direct stimulation of pDC via TLR-7 or -9 may still provide an anatomic advantage over the simple administration of IFN-a, in that activated pDC will produce antiviral type I IFN directly in the sites where HIV is actively replicating, whereas the dynamics with which IFN-a distributes in lymphoid tissue is hard to predict. On the other hand, chronic HIV infection results in progressive impairment of pDC responsiveness to TLR-7 and -9 stimulation [41], which may undermine the potential efficacy of treatments which target these receptors. This hyporesponsiveness is in part caused by viral proteins, such as gp120mediated inhibition of TLR-9 activation [79] , and in part by the fact that HIV itself is a powerful and persistent stimulus for pDC, causing them to be refractory to further stimulation due to future science group type I IFN-mediated negative feedback [41] . This last observation constitutes a strong criticism to the use of TLR-7 and -9 agonists or IFN-a/b as antiviral treatments of HIV infection: if HIV itself is a stimulus powerful enough to dampen the responsiveness of pDC to external stimulation, why is this not sufficient to exert antiviral effect? Also, in such an overstimulated environment, is it really beneficial to deliver additional pressure to the immune system? The potential risk of pDC overstimulation are epitomized by studies performed on murine models, in which repeated administration of TLR-7 or -9 agonists resulted in severe impairment of immune function [46, 47] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 466, "end": 470, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 947, "end": 951, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1252, "end": 1256, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1566, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2161, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2295, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2341, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3139, "end": 3143, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3352, "end": 3356, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3984, "end": 3988, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3989, "end": 3992, "text": "47]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "future science group"}, {"text": "Ideally, the optimal therapy against a viral infection is the one aimed at clearing the organism of the infectious agent or, at least, reducing the replication and spread of the virus.

Furthermore, HIV differs from most chronic viral infections in that it preferentially replicates in lymphoid tissues and produces cell-free virions throughout the course of infection, therefore providing a constant and systemic stimulus for pDC (reviewed in [82] ).

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine diffuse through the cell membrane and raise the pH of endocytotic vescicles [97] .
