They are associated with potentially serious morbidity if unattended or treated subop-timally. They also are infections in which evaluation of specific anti-infective therapy may be difficult. The reasons for the difficulties include: (1) routine noninvasive collection of specimens and culture techniques are often inadequate, and specimens are regularly contaminated by the indigenous microflora of the oropharynx and the upper airways; (2) the microbial etiology is often complex and polymicrobial; and (3) newly recognized etiologic agents continue to emerge (e.g. , Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnettii). Even with the use of sophisticated sampling and microbiologic techniques, the causative agents can be identified only for a small proportion (60%-80% at best) of patients. Furthermore, good clinical practice requires empiric initiation of anti-infective therapy for these conditions (with the possible exception of group A streptococcal pharyngitis) on the basis of a presumptive initial diagnosis before confirmatory microbiologic data are available. Frequently, the microbiologic response to therapy cannot be definitively evaluated, even when the etiologic agent has been identified. This is often the case in otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia, when the use of invasive procedures such as tympanocentesis, sinus puncture, or transtracheal aspiration to confirm microbial eradication in the patient who is improving clinically generally is considered unjustified. Thus, whereas microbiologic failure can be documented by repeat cultures, microbiologic eradication can only be assessed presumptively on the basis of clinical response.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "B.

Presumed microbiologic eradication is defined as cases in which pretreatment cultures of MEE were performed and were positive. In these cases, posttreatment cultures are considered unwarranted because of the complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. Microbiologic suppression is defined as cases in which the causative organism is demonstrated to be eliminated in repeated culture of MEE aspirates after 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy. This response is likely to be seen only in the setting of clinical failure, when repeated aspiration of MEE is indicated. Definitiveevidence of microbiologic eradication is not possible if concomitant antimicrobial therapy is provided. Microbiologic persistence is defined as a positive culture of MEE aspirates after at least 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy. If a pretreatment culture of MEE was performed and was positive, the isolation of the same organism after~72 hours of therapy is considered confirmed microbiologic persistence. If no pretreatment aspiration of MEE was performed, isolation of a pathogen in culture after 72 hours of treatment is considered presumptive microbiologicpersistence. Superinfection is defined as identification of new organisms in repeated cultures of MEE aspirates after at least 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy. A superinfection can be demonstrated only if a pathogen was isolated from an earlier MEE aspirate. 6. Summary of Guideline (a) Baseline Assessment Should Include the Following Procedures:(1) Initial clinical evaluation including otoscopic examination with pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, or acoustic reflectometry; (2) hematologic, hepatic, and renal function studies; and (3) aspiration ofMEE and microbiologic studies for phase 2 trials and optionally for phase 3 trials.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF9": {"text": "Assessment During Course of Therapy Should Include:(1) Clinical and otoscopic evaluation at 3-5 days and 10-14 days after initiation of antimicrobial therapy and at least biweekly thereafter (2 and 4-6 weeks later) until resolution of all symptoms and signs; (2) MEE aspiration for microbiologic studies in patients who fail to respond clinically after at least 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy to define microbio-", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF12": {"text": "pneumoniae. .
