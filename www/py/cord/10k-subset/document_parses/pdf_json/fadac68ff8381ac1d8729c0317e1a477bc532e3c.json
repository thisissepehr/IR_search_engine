Influenza A/England: an outbreak at a military academy. Am J Epidemiol 100:216-221. 1974.-The first outbreak of A/England influenza in the United States during the 1972-1973 respiratory season is described. The outbreak was confined to an unvaccinated population of 3935 cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado. During the 10-day period of the outbreak, 778 (19.8 per cent) of the cadets were affected, and specific attack rates for each of the four cadet classes ranged from 170.8/1000 to 227.1/1000. For three days preceding the outbreak, about 400 recently vaccinated naval midshipmen from the U.S. Naval Academy shared quarters with the Air Force cadets. During the four days following the visit, a single midshipman developed possible influenza whereas, in the same period, 362 cadet cases were recognized. The highly significant difference in attack rates (2.5 versus 89.5/1000) provides evidence for the efficacy of the 1972-1973 influenza vaccine against the A/ England/42/72 variant. influenza, A/England; influenza vaccine; respiratory tract infections; vaccine, influenza", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In late October 1972, the first documented outbreak of A/England/42/72 in-fluenza in the United States occurred at the U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado.

However, during the three days immediately preceding the outbreak, a group of midshipmen from the U.S. Naval Academy had visited the Air Force Academy and shared quarters with the cadets.

The throat washings were obtained in 25 ml Hanks' balanced salt solution, immediately frozen at -70 C, and maintained in that state until tested in the laboratory. Specimens were pretreated with antibiotics (penicillin 400 units, streptomycin 200 fig), inoculated intra-amniotically into nine-day old embryonated chick eggs, primary rhesus monkey kidney cells, diploid WI-38 cells, and subpassaged in primary human embryonic kidney cells. After appropriate incubation at 35 C, fluid from cell cultures showing cytopathic effect or allantoic fluid was subpassaged, harvested, and screened for presence of hemagglutinins to chicken red blood cells. Virus isolates of sufficient hemagglutinin titer were further characterized by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing, using control antigens and monospecific reference antisera for A/Hong Kong/8/68, A/ England/42/72, and B/Massachusetts/3/ 66. Additional confirmatory HI tests were performed (courtesy of Dr. Marion Coleman, WHO International Influenza Center for the Americas, CDC, Atlanta, Ga.) using the sera above as well as antihemag-glutinin (H3), A/Hong Kong/5/72, and B/Victoria/98926/70.

In general, one or two midshipmen shared a room with one or two cadets. On their return to Annapolis, these midshipmen did not experience an influ-enza outbreak such as occurred at the Air Force Academy. Indeed, only one member of this midshipmen group developed an influenza-like illness (diagnosed as viral syndrome) during the five-day period following their return (2) . Interestingly, all midshipmen at the Naval Academy (total population 3,943) had been vaccinated against influenza with the latest formulation (bivalent influenza virus vaccine, containing 700 CCA units of type AJ Aichi/2/68 and 300 CCA units of type B/Massachusetts/1/71) on October 7-9, 1 Vi to 2 weeks prior to their visit to the Air Force Academy.

Nearly 20 per cent of the cadet population were seen at the clinic, and, no doubt, others were affected as well.

However, the differences in attack rates between the C4C and ClC classes and between the C4C and C2C classes are statistically significant (p < .05). One might have expected these differences to be reversed, since the freshman class (C4C), unlike the upper classes (C1C-C3C), had had no prior influenza vaccination experience, and, as a group, was exposed to greater physical and mental stresses than were the other inured classes. On the other hand, freshmen tend to feel greater academic pressures than do upper classmen.

Thus, for both the 1971-1972 and 1972-1973 influenza seasons, the cadet group experienced outbreaks of the illness before its recognized epidemic occurrence in the rest of the state.

The earliest most of these initial cases could have been exposed was therefore the previous Thursday. The midshipmen arrived in the evening on Friday, and departed about noon on Sunday. If the exposure of the cadets had been limited to a short period prior to the arrival of the midshipmen on Friday, with no further exposure during the weekend, one would have expected a bimodal frequency distribution of cases (indicating secondary transmission from this initial group of cases) rather than the continuous pattern of cases seen throughout the following week.
