We have cell banks that we have thoroughly characterized, and, more importantly, we have shown that the cells do not change during the production process or from one campaign to the other. The cell banking system is really a two-part system: there is a master cell bank (Fig. 1) , and there are working cell banks. The master working cell bank is a system in which we preserve the cells at -135 ~ Each time we begin a campaign we thaw a vial from the working cell bank; therefore, we always begin with the same starting material.",

The cell culture remaining in the bioreactor is essentially the inoculum for the next medium feeding. This process continues for approximately 15 cycles, a typical run.

To achieve these goals, we have developed a purification process as shown in Fig. 6 . The first step is filtration, in which we remove the cells by physical means with a a filter that is small enough to allow factor VIII to pass through. The next step is immunoaffinity chromatography, using the same monoclonal antibody that is used for purification of the plasma-derived factor VIII preparation Hemofil M. The basis for the separation is reactivity: the monoclonal antibody identifies a specific region, a specific epitope, on the factor VIII molecule, and achieves a very high degree of purification. Most of the residues flow through the immunoaffinity column (Fig.7) . Factor VIII is then eluted off. Two different ion-exchange steps follow. By changing the p H o f the column load, we change the charge on factor VIII. The residues, having a different charge, pass through the column. The most important advantage of recombinant factor VIII is the absence of viral contaminants. Clearly, viral safety is a very important aspect of factor VIII. Of course viruses that are not present in the human source should not be introduced into recombinant factor VIII. We believe that we have eliminated problems that have occurred in the past as a result of human-source and raw materials, but we do not want to add any more problems to the situation. We therefore have worked out a five-point viral safety program.",

These three animal-sourced raw materials are subjected to solvent treatment steps and subsequent chromatography separation and are quite pure. It should again be emphasized that we do not use serum, so the general \"gemisch\" that one would get from serum, from fetal calf serum or whatever, is not present. All of our animal sources are highly purified and are derived only from cattle in Canada or the USA. One example of these animal-based raw materials is bovine insulin, which is exposed to low p H a n d high ethanol concentration and is purified via precipitation, gel filtration, etc (Fig. 8) . The insulin is also tested for typical viruses. All other animal-sourced raw materials are also purified extensively, further assuring safety.",

Even if we were able to get a virus into this system, our purification process has a very good capacity to remove it. This has been proven by validating the processes: we have chosen viruses from the various classes that could potentially infect the CHO system (Fig. 11) ; we scaled down the purification process to laboratory scale, we added these viruses to the scaled-down purification process, and we analyzed the removal of the virus through the system -just in case. We demonstrated a decrease of viruses of 7-13 logs. Therefore, we feel comfortable in claiming that we have a process that would not allow viruses in, would test against viruses, and, in the extremely rare chance that a virus actually infected the cells, would remove it. It can be assumed that it is a virus-flee product. Figure 12 shows the monoclonal antibody columns, two large columns acting as a single column in the cold room. The volumes get much smaller as you go through the process. In the end there is 11 of drug-substance (Fig. 13) , sufficient for thousands of patients, stored in a freezer at our site until it is fully tested and released for further processing. Figure 14 is an overview of our testing program. The consistency of the process is demonstrated by quite a bit of testing. We test the working cell bank mentioned above; we assay the inoculum and the conditioned medium for microbial purity and endotoxin levels; we calculate the productivity of the bioreactor; we do postproduction cell-line testing; we make certain that the chromatography buffers are contaminant free; we ana- lyze the eluates from the columns to make certain that the proper amount of factor VIII is in the system, and that the columns perform properly as in-process controls. Before we release the product to Hyland for fur-ther processing we have to go through a very rigorous set of release tests as well. Finally, the utilities in our production process are thoroughly analyzed to make certain that we are not adding any microbial contami-S19 9 Microbial contaminants -Mycoplasma by both direct and indirect tests -Sterility for bacteria and fungi 9 Adventitious viral contaminants -In vitro assay using 6 cell lines (human, bovine, primate and hamster) 9 Retroviral contaminants -Transmission EM -Infectivity tets-S +L-for xenotropic viruses -Reverse transcriptase assay Fig. 9 Puritytesting of cells prior to and after cultivation Fig. 13 End-product -11, sufficient for 2000 patients",
