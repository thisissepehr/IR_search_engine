After the embryo had been removed, the CAMs were harvested and minced carefully with a pair of scissors. The small pieces were suspended in prewarmed PBS without Ca++ and Mg++ and washed by letting them settle 5 to 7 times by gravity in PBS until the supernatant appeared clear. Virtually all erythrocytes are eliminated by this procedure. The tissue was then suspended in prewarmed GKN-buffer containing 0.01~ collagenase and 0.001% hyaluronidase and stirred for 15 rain at room temperature. The tissue fragments were allowed to sediment again, and after removal of the supernatant they were resuspended in 0.20/0 trypsin in versenebuffer (0.2~ EDTA, pit 7.2) and stirred for 30 to 60 rain at room temperature. After the residual crude material had settled, the supernatant cell suspension was centrifuged gently (about 400 g for 4 rain), and the cell pellet was washed again in versene-buffer. After recentrifugation the cells were resuspended in medium 199 containing 10~ fetal calf serum. The cells, 3 \u2022 10 ~, were seeded into 60 mm plastic Petri dishes (Greiner, Niirtingen) and incubated at 37 ~ C in a water-saturated atmosphere with 60]0 COz.

Table 1 shows that the yield of newly formed myxoviruses was higher in CAMcells than in conventional chick fibroblasts. Hemagglutinating activity of virus released into the medium and plaque-counts on CAM-cells were considerably higher for almost all influenza virus strains. Of particular interest is the high yield of NDV, because it reached levels comparable to those in chicken kidney cells. Table 2 shows that the two strains of avian reoviruses and infectious bronchitis virus reached high titers in CAM-cells. Staining with specific fluorescent antibodies against the reoviruses showed that only epithelioid cells contained the virusspecific antigen, whereas fibroblasts remained unstained. CAM cells could be used for plaque-assays of all virus strains tested including HSV I, HSV I I and PsR. MDV was the only exception. Although the virus induced a cytopathic effect under liquid medium, no clearly discernible plaques appeared, even if the cells were kept up to 7 days before they were stained. After such a prolonged incubation period the monolayer showed signs of nonspecific disintegration such as vacuolization and formation of a web-like cell sheet. Incubation of the MDV-infccted cells under liquid medium for l day before the agar overlay was added did not promote the appearance of plaques after 4 more days of incubation.",
