However, the success of this strategy requires the prompt onset of therapy within 48 hours of the appearance of clinical symptoms. This requirement may be captured by a compartmental model that monitors the density of infected individuals in terms of the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. We show that such a model can be expressed by a system of delay differential equations with both discrete and distributed delays. The model is analyzed to derive the criterion for disease control based on two critical factors: (i) the profile of treatment rate; and (ii) the level of treatment as a function of time lag in commencing therapy. Numerical results are also obtained to illustrate the feasible region of disease control. Our findings show that due to uncertainty in the attack rate of a pandemic strain, initiating therapy immediately upon diagnosis can significantly increase the likelihood of disease control and substantially reduce the required community-level of treatment. This suggests that reliable diagnostic methods for influenza cases should be rapidly implemented within an antiviral treatment strategy. (Seyed M. Moghadas).",

The most devastating pandemic recorded in the history of human diseases occurred in 1918 and was responsible for approximately 50 million deaths among the countless infected (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006) . Such high fatality may result from exposure to a virus with major alterations in the viral genome (due to re-assortment or recombination), or to a novel influenza viral strain introduced in humans by zoonotic switch. This poses the great threat of an imminent influenza pandemic through the evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus to one that is readily transmitted between humans (Gani et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Considering the catastrophic results of previous pandemics, the development of effective control strategies is undoubtedly a high priority of global public health efforts. Previous studies have rationalized the use of antiviral agents for both treatment and prophylaxis as a primary control measure during early stages of a pandemic (Ferguson et al., 2005 (Ferguson et al., , 2006 Gani et al., 2005; Germann et al., 2006; Longini et al., 2004 Longini et al., , 2005 . It has been shown that effective antiviral treatment can substantially reduce viral shedding and the infectiousness period of a clinical case. However, to achieve such effectiveness, therapy should be initiated as early as possible within the 48 hours of appearance of clinical symptoms, referred to as the window of opportunity for effective treatment (Ferguson et al., 2006; Linde, 2001) . In most cases, there has already been a time delay for clinical diagnosis, and therefore, also the onset of therapy, which could greatly jeopardize the impact of the treatment strategy. This point has been discussed in previous stochastic models employed to simulate potential outbreaks of the present deadly H5N1 strain in rural Southeast Asia and assess the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis (Ferguson et al., 2005; Longini et al., 2005) . Based on social networks and close contacts in household clusters, schools, workplaces, and other social settings, they predicted that a pandemic could be contained at the origin through a combination of targeted blanket prophylaxis and social distancing. A key assumption is that the virus remains less transmissible than pandemic viruses of the last century, so that the reproduction number stays below 2.4. The predictions of these models, however, depend strongly on the specific location of an initial outbreak, patterns of exposure to infection in localities, and how quickly infected cases are diagnosed and their contacts offered prophylaxis. In view of considerable uncertainties in social settings and parameters characterizing the nature of an impending epidemic, it is suggested that compartmental models with relatively few parameters may still be a viable approach to the general understanding of determinants in the course of an outbreak and the impact of interventions (Arino et al., 2006) .",

The resulting epidemic model, formulated as a system of delay differential equations, incorporates a parameter for the level of treatment which is determined by the functional form of the treatment rate varying with age of infection. The importance of such variation and early application of antiviral drugs are highlighted in a recent experimental study of the kinetics of influenza A virus infection in humans (Baccam et al., 2006) . Thus, control of an epidemic is affected by the delay in initiating a course of treatment, as well as the prescribed rate at which diagnosed clinical cases are given priority and treated. The model is analyzed to obtain a criterion for containing the epidemic in the presence of the treatment strategy. Using different profiles of treatment rate, numerical results are obtained to display the feasible region of disease control as a function of the level of treatment and the time delay in the onset of therapy. The results are placed in the context of public health, in terms of epidemiological implications and development of effective treatment strategies.",

Therefore, the strategy that gives priority to early treatment has a better chance of controlling the disease, and confers greater overall benefit to the healthcare system by substantially reducing the required level of treatment. For example, with no delay and an attack rate of 30%, a minimum of 85% treatment level is required to ensure R c < 1 in the former strategy (Fig. 3) , while this level is reduced to 62% in the latter strategy (Fig. 4) .

To illustrate the feasible region of disease control, where R c is reduced to below one, we examined two different strategies corresponding to treatment rates that increase (decrease) toward the end of the window of opportunity for starting treatment. Simulation results, over an estimated range of attack rates (Gani et al., 2005; Longini et al., 2004 Longini et al., , 2005 , reveal that control of the disease is more likely to be achieved, and with less stringent requirements on the community-level of treatment, as the delay in onset of therapy diminishes. Therefore, a strategy that favors therapy immediately following the onset of clinical symptoms is more effective and confers greater population-wide benefit. This highlights the importance of early diagnosis of clinical infections through rapid implementation of reliable evaluation tests for influenza cases.",

Such modification introduces the drug supply as a new parameter in the model, which may affect the control reproduction number, and consequently the results of simulations reported here. However, whether the supply is limited or not, extreme caution is required for preventing the evolution of drug-resistant viral strains through the widespread or indiscriminate use of antiviral drugs (Ferguson et al., 2003; Stilianakis et al., 1998) . This is crucial for reducing the likelihood of multiple pandemic waves caused by the emergence of resistant viral mutants.
