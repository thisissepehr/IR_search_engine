            "text": "Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent maturation of IL-1b have been implicated in acute lung injury (ALI), resulting in inflammation and fibrosis. We investigated the role of vimentin, a type III intermediate filament, in this process using three well-characterized murine models of ALI known to require NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We demonstrate that central pathophysiologic events in ALI (inflammation, IL-1b levels, endothelial and alveolar epithelial barrier permeability, remodelling and fibrosis) are attenuated in the lungs of Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice challenged with LPS, bleomycin and asbestos. Bone marrow chimeric mice lacking vimentin have reduced IL-1b levels and attenuated lung injury and fibrosis following bleomycin exposure. Furthermore, decreased active caspase-1 and IL-1b levels are observed in vitro in Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 and vimentin-knockdown macrophages. Importantly, we show direct protein-protein interaction between NLRP3 and vimentin. This study provides insights into lung inflammation and fibrosis and suggests that vimentin may be a key regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome.",

Vimentin is the most abundant IF protein and has a critical role in stabilizing intracellular architecture 2 . Until recently, the importance of vimentin remained elusive because vimentin knockout (Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 ) mice displayed a relatively normal phenotype 3 . However, a thorough characterization of Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice under stress conditions revealed prominent abnormalities [4] [5] [6] , complementing the metabolic, signalling and regulatory abnormalities displayed by patients with IF-related diseases and mice expressing functional mutations in IFs 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Recently, evidence to support a role for IFs as scaffolds for macromolecular complexes involved in critical cell signalling functions was reported 11, 12 . In this study, we demonstrate that vimentin is required for the activation of the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome, a macromolecular complex that orchestrates early inflammatory responses of the innate immune system.",

The wide range of pathogens known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome suggests that NLRP3 indirectly senses microbes by probing for hostderived danger-associated molecular patterns that are produced or released after cellular or tissue injury 17, 18 . For example, uric acid released from cells exposed to bleomycin triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to maturation of interleukin 1b (IL-1b) and inflammation 19 . In both human patients and animals treated with bleomycin, IL-1b released from injured cells results in production of the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), which contributes to the development of pulmonary fibrosis 20 . In addition, exposure to crystalline particles such as asbestos and silica also cause pulmonary fibrosis 21 that is regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome 22, 23 .",

Unlike other inflammasome-associated Nod-like receptor (NLR) proteins, NLRP3 is expressed at very low levels in naive macrophages. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires two distinct pro-inflammatory stimuli. In the first step, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling activates NF-kB and upregulates NLRP3 and pro-IL-1b 24 . The second step involves the assembly of the multiprotein complex, which induces selfcleavage of caspase-1, which in turn mediates the cleavage of pro-IL-1b into its biologically active form 25 .

Wild-type mice exposed to LPS exhibited an increase in wet-todry lung weight ratio and total protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), whereas Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice failed to exhibit such an increase (Fig. 1c,d) .

Therefore, to further characterize the nature of immune cell recruitment into the lungs, we performed a systematic flow cytometric analysis of whole-lung lysates 31 . No differences were observed in the myeloid cell population between WT and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice treated with saline ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a ). As expected, both WT and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice challenged with LPS had significant increases in neutrophils and moderate increases in macrophages compared with saline-treated animals ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ); no differences were observed between WT and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice challenged with LPS ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a) .

The NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathological increase of IL-1b production in a variety of pulmonary inflammatory diseases that lead to fibrosis, including asbestosis [21] [22] [23] . In a model of asbestosis, we sought to determine whether Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice showed diminished cytokine production and whether these animals were protected from lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis. Wild-type and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice were exposed to crocidolite asbestos or an inert particle, titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ); markers of injury, inflammation, cytokine production and fibrosis were assessed. Confirming previous reports 22, 23 , asbestosexposed mice had increased total cell numbers in BALF compared with TiO 2 -exposed animals. However, significantly fewer cells were recruited to the lungs of Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice after asbestos exposure (Fig. 2a) . Additional analysis of immune cell recruitment into the lungs of WT and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of whole-lung lysates ( Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Wild-type mice had profound inflammatory cell infiltrates following exposure to asbestos as observed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining; in contrast Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice showed reduced inflammation ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ). Wild-type mice exhibited an increase in total protein concentration in BALF, whereas Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice failed to exhibit such an increase (Fig. 2b) . The reduction in inflammation in Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice exposed to asbestos was associated with reduced levels of caspase-1 and IL-1b in BALF compared with WT mice (Fig. 2c,d) . These data suggest that vimentin is required for asbestos-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (step 2), but not for NF-kB activation and upregulation of pro-IL-1b and NLRP3 (step 1). Furthermore, we observed that WT mice exposed to asbestos develop pulmonary fibrosis, as assessed by Masson trichrome and Picrosirius red stain (a dye that binds specifically to collagen fibrils, Fig. 2e ) and Sircol assay (Fig. 2f) . Vimentin deficiency prevented pulmonary fibrosis, as no significant increase in collagen deposition was observed in Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice (Fig. 2e,f) . Collectively, these results demonstrate that loss of vimentin prevents asbestos-induced collagen deposition and fibrosis.",

            "text": "In patients with pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary function tests typically reveal a parenchymal-restrictive ventilatory defect due to decreased lung compliance 36 . Lung compliance is influenced by the underlying connective tissue, which is rich in extracellular matrix components such as collagen 37 . Because Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice exhibited less collagen deposition following treatment with either bleomycin or asbestos, we reasoned that lungs of these mice would maintain normal compliance. To test this hypothesis, we measured the lung mechanics of WT and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice using a SCIREQ ventilator 21 days following the bleomycin administration. In comparison with saline treatments, lungs of WT mice exhibited a 2.5-fold decrease in quasi-static compliance following the bleomycin administration, whereas the compliance of lungs from Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice decreased only 1.3-fold (Fig. 4e) . Bleomycin administration creates heterogeneous regions of lung fibrosis in mice (Fig. 4a) , which is a pathologic feature of the human disease as well 38 . To assess focal changes in lung tissue stiffness, we performed regional nano-indentations on lung sections (200-400 mm thick) using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The micro-indentations provide a measure of the stiffness or elastic modulus (E) of lung tissue, which is inversely related to lung compliance. Elasticity maps from AFM micro-indentation from bleomycin-treated WT lungs clearly displayed the wide ranges of tissue stiffness (Fig. 4c) , which corresponded to the heterogeneity of collagen deposition (Fig. 4a) . The median elastic modulus of lung parenchymal tissue from WT mice increased 2.4-fold in response to bleomycin compared with control lung tissue (27 to 7.5 kPa, respectively), whereas the elastic modulus of lung tissue from bleomycin-treated Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice was significantly decreased (Po0.0001) compared with WT bleomycin-treated lung tissue (Fig. 4f) . The wide range of E-values is reflected in the frequency of occurrence and in the median and interquartile ranges for each condition ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ). In addition, there was a strong correlation (Pearson r \u00bc \u00c0 0.99) between the mean compliance values for each condition and the mean E-values for each condition (for example, WT-bleomycin-AFM versus WTbleomycin-SCIREQ). Thus, the mechanical properties of the lung were preserved in Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice following the bleomycin treatment, which is evident at both the global tissue scale and in focal regions of lung.",

Reconstitution of bone marrow from WT donor mice into irradiated recipient mice (WT) resulted in protein accumulation in BALF in response to bleomycin, whereas in recipient mice reconstituted with bone marrow from Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 donor mice (Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 ), the BALF protein was unchanged from saline controls (Fig. 5b) .

            "text": "Loss of vimentin prevents NLRP3 activation. As stated above, NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires two distinct stimuli. An inflammatory stimulus, such as LPS, primes cells to transcribe and synthesize pro-IL-1b (signal 1) and then another stimulus such as extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), monosodium urate (MSU) or asbestos (signal 2) is necessary for inflammasome complex formation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1b maturation 19, 22, 39 . To further investigate the possibility that NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires vimentin, we isolated primary alveolar macrophages from WT and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice. Macrophages were primed with LPS and stimulated with ATP as previously described 39 . Levels of mature caspase-1 and IL-1b were significantly increased in the supernatants collected from WT macrophages following LSP and ATP treatment compared with saline treatment, but in the supernatant collected from Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 macrophages there was only a slight increase (Fig. 6a,b) . There was no difference in pro-IL-1b levels in total cell lysates between activated WT and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 alveolar macrophages ( Fig. 6c ; full blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7) . As an independent approach, we expressed a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to vimentin (Vim KD ) or a scrambled shRNA (Ctrl) in J774a.1 macrophages and treated the cells with ATP. Caspase-1 is required to cleave pro-IL-1b into its biologically active form and like other caspases is proteolytically activated from a pro-enzyme to produce a tetramer of its two active subunits, p20 and p10 (ref. 28 ). The levels of mature caspase-1 p20, but not pro-caspase-1, were considerably reduced in Vim KD cells (Fig. 6d ,e; full blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7 ) compared with Ctrl cells treated with ATP, further supporting the hypothesis that vimentin deficiency prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Uric acid released from cells exposed to bleomycin triggers NLRP3 inflammasome assembly leading to IL-1b maturation and inflammation in the lungs 19, 40 . In an in vitro model, we examined whether silencing vimentin would impair NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to MSU. A human macrophage-like cell line was treated with silencing RNA (siRNA) targeted to vimentin (Vim KD ) or a scrambled siRNA (CT; Fig. 7a ; full blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 8 ) and subsequently activated with MSU. No differences were observed in the levels of pro-IL-1b between CT and Vim KD cells (Fig. 7a) , suggesting that vimentin deficiency does not impair signal 1. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was repressed in Vim KD cells as assessed by IL-1b and caspase-1 levels in cell supernatants (Fig. 7b,c) . Similar results were obtained when CT and Vim KD cells were activated with asbestos (Fig. 7b,c) . In addition, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from WT and Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice, primed with LPS and activated with MSU. Caspase-1 activation was assessed using a specific fluorescent probe, FAM-YVAD-FMK 41 . WT BMDMs showed robust caspase-1 activation following treatment with MSU, with caspase-1 forming aggregates throughout the cytoplasm. However, caspase-1 activation was severely reduced in BMDMs isolated from Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice (Fig. 7d) . No caspase-1 activation was observed in untreated BMDMs isolated from either WT or Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice.",

Inflammasome activation involves the physical interaction of NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and caspase-1 (ref. 28 ), but the mechanism by which the inflammasome assembles is not clear. If the vimentin network serves as a protein scaffold upon which the NLRP3 inflammasome components are assembled, then vimentin should interact with inflammasome proteins. Immunoprecipitation of caspase-1 and NLRP3 from human macrophage lysates resulted in a robust co-precipitation of vimentin, which was enhanced following activation of cells with ATP ( Fig. 8a ; full blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 9 ).

Furthermore, the vimentin network spanned the cytoplasm in the WT activated cells, whereas in unstimulated cells, the network appeared to be collapsed around the nucleus and lamellipodia were not observed (Fig. 8d) . Vimentin filaments (red) strongly co-localized with NLRP3 (green) in both perinuclear and distal regions of the cells. Co-localization studies were performed using Fiji 1.48r (64-bit, win) and the Coloc 2 test 43 . Co-localization analyses were calculated on ROIs drawn around the lamellipodia, determined by the vimentin image. The thresholded Manders co-localization scores were 0.89 \u00b1 0.15 for vimentin and 0.86 \u00b1 0.18 for NLRP3. NLRP3 and ASC also colocalized in stimulated macrophages ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ); the score for NLRP3 co-localization with ASC in untreated cells was 0.20 \u00b1 0.11, indicating weak co-localization.

Our data obtained in vimentin knockout mice and vimentin-null cells suggest that vimentin is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Dysregulated inflammation, excessive leukocyte accumulation and increased permeability of endothelial and alveolar epithelial barriers are the central pathophysiologic events in ALI and its most severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 44 . All these end points were observed in WT mice challenged with LPS, bleomycin and asbestos.

In fact, alveolar macrophages from patients with ARDS produce excessive amounts of IL-1b 46 , and IL-18 was elevated in the plasma of patients with ARDS, which correlated with increased morbidity and mortality 45 . Since vimentin-deficient mice were protected from ALI, we speculated that failure to produce inflammasome-mediated cytokines (for example, IL-1b) caused this protection. In fact, vimentin-deficient mice failed to increase mature IL-1b levels following exposure to LPS, asbestos or bleomycin. Moreover, we demonstrated that caspase-1 activation and mature IL-1b production in vitro requires vimentin, as no increase was observed in activated macrophages either isolated from Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice or in which vimentin was silenced using RNA interference.",

            "text": "Resolution of ALI/ARDS depends on a precise balance of inflammatory and molecular signalling 44 ; an imbalance in that process caused by IL-1b overproduction might prevent cellular restoration and lead to pulmonary fibrosis. In fact, IL-1b produced by the inflammasome has been recently identified as an initiator of fibrosis in response to bleomycin 35 , and administration of IL-1b alone recapitulates much of the lung pathology caused by bleomycin 47 . Because vimentin-deficient mice did not produce the same amount of IL-1b as WT mice, we reasoned that Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice would be protected from bleomycin-and asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Indeed, lung pathology was significantly reduced in vimentin-deficient mice, pointing to the essential role of vimentin in pulmonary fibrosis. We found substantially less collagen deposition in Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice compared with WT mice. The excessive collagen deposition in lungs of WT mice led to loss of mechanical compliance, whereas the lungs of Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice maintained compliance similar to that of saline-treated mice. These results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating decreases in the compliance of fibrotic lungs 33 . The elastic modulus measurements strongly suggest that increased tissue stiffness at the microscale corresponds to areas of increased collagen deposition. Importantly, macroscale measurements of lung compliance were highly correlated with the microscale elastic modulus measurements obtained by AFM.",

IL-1b-induced fibrosis is associated with an increase in TGF-1b, demonstrating that ALI initiated by proinflammatory cytokines can result in progressive fibrosis 35, 48 . Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice were treated with recombinant mouse IL-1b (rmIL-1b 0.05 mg kg \u00c0 1 body weight, intranasal (i.n.)), but we were unable to detect latent TGF-b1 in BALF from Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice after i.n. rmIL-1b at days 1, 7 and 14 (data not shown), whereas latent TGF-b1 was detected 5 days after bleomycin administration in WT mice (Fig. 3) . Gasse et al. 19 reported that collagen deposition was increased by rmIL-1b in wild-type mice; Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice treated with rmIL-1b had no increase in collagen deposition. We reason that the incomplete suppression of mIL-1b in Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice is a reflection of incomplete chimera, with only B90% engraftment. Studies with IL-1R1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 , MyD88 \u00c0 / \u00c0 , ASC \u00c0 / \u00c0 , Caspase-1 \u00c0 / \u00c0 and NLRP3 \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice have suggested that uric acid (induced by bleomycin), asbestos and silica are detected by the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, likely leading to IL-1R1/MyD88 signalling in pulmonary epithelial cells, then to inflammation, neutrophil and lymphocyte recruitment and fibroblast activation 35 . Lung fibroblast activation results in collagen deposition and pulmonary fibrosis. Importantly, it was reported that vimentin is required for the stabilization of collagen mRNAs 49 . We reason that the Vim \u00c0 / \u00c0 mice treated with either rmIL-1b or WT bone marrow failed to increase collagen deposition because vimentin knockout fibroblasts fail to produce type I collagen due to decreased stability of collagen a1(I) and a2(I) mRNAs 49 .",

These phenotypes led us to investigate whether vimentin might serve as a scaffold for the inflammasome by binding to one or more proteins in the inflammasome complex. Several studies have suggested that IFs, including vimentin, act as scaffolds for signalling molecules 2,11,12 . In fact, vimentin interacts with and is involved in the translocation of pERK1/2 to the nucleus 51 , limits the ability of 14-3-3 to interact with Raf and CdK1, and regulates the release and translocation of ROKa following RhoA activation. These findings exemplify how vimentin IFs can act as scaffolds for signalling molecules. Recently, vimentin was reported to bind to NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2), a member of the NLR family, via the leucin-richrepeat (LRR) 52 . The LRR is a protein-binding domain shared by 19 other NLR family members, including NLRP3. Therefore, we sought to determine whether vimentin interacts with NLRP3. In our experiments, immunoprecipitation of both NLRP3 and caspase-1 in lysates from WT alveolar macrophages resulted in a robust co-precipitation of vimentin, which was enhanced following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. These data were confirmed by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy of human and murine macrophages. The co-localization score for vimentin with NLRP3 was 0.89\u00b10.15, indicating strong colocalization 43 . Moreover, we were able to demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction between vimentin and NLRP3 by BLI assays, further establishing a role for vimentin in assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.",

            "text": "We can only speculate about where and how vimentin associates with NLRP3 and caspase-1 during inflammasome assembly, since the crystal structures of the vimentin dimer and all components of the inflammasome except for PYD are unknown [13] [14] [15] . NLRP3 proteins have been shown to form inactive preassembled complexes in unstimulated cells [13] [14] [15] . Under stimulation, these proteins undergo conformational changes whereby the inflammasome is activated. The vimentin IF network could potentially associate with the NLRP3 inflammasome through one or more domains of NLRP3 and mediate the conformation change or stabilization of NLRP3 that leads to activation. We reason that vimentin may interact with NLRP3 in two distinct regions: the NACHT domain and the LRR; vimentin has been previously shown to interact with NOD2 in the LRR domain 52 . Because ASC is localized to the nucleus in unactivated cells, no interaction with vimentin is anticipated in nonactivated cells. Furthermore, on the basis of the structure of ASC, a PYD and CARD domain with a short linker, we do not anticipate a direct interaction with vimentin as vimentin lacks either of the ASC domains, therefore, any ASC signal following cell activation is anticipated to be due to vimentin interaction with other proteins in the inflammasome protein complex. An unresolved issue is how vimentin mediates inflammasome activation. Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been linked to inflammasome activation 55 . Vimentin IF are known to modulate mitochondrial motility 56 , and lack of vimentin results in increased ROS production 57 . This suggests that vimentin-deficient cells should have more robust inflammasome signalling, the exact opposite of what we have demonstrated. In a very provocative paper, however, Bauernfeind et al. 24 demonstrated that mitochondrial-derived ROS is required for priming, not activation, of the inflammasome, as ROS inhibitors blocked the priming step required for NLRP3 expression, but activation was not affected. This correlates with our findings that signal 1 is unaffected by the lack of vimentin. Further studies on the relationship between vimentin, mitochondria and ROS will likely provide insights into the regulation behind both signals 1 and 2 during inflammation, but currently they are beyond the scope of this paper.",
