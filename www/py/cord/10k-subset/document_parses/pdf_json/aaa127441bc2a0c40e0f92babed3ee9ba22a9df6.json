All observational studies are vulnerable to confounding by indication. Our study was less susceptible to this bias than past observational studies on fluid Estimated effects on 30-day mortality of selected fluid volume caps compared to current practice administration for two reasons. First, the MIMIC dataset we used in our analysis contained granular temporal detail on a large number of clinical variables, which allowed us to adjust for more confounding variables than past studies. Second, exploiting the temporal detail of the MIMIC data, we employed causal inference methods that appropriately handled the time-varying nature of the problem. Even where prior retrospective studies attempt to control for patient-level variables using logistic regression [11, 12] or proportional hazard models [7] [8] [9] [10] , these methods only control for baseline confounders, not confounders that evolve as the illness course progresses in the ICU. For example, patients A and B with septic shock may have similar baseline characteristics, but at hour 12, patient A may have improved, while patient B may have worsened. This change in clinical condition affects the propensity of these patients to receive further fluids between hours 12 and 24 and is also clearly associated with mortality. By using the methods outlined above, we have accounted for such time-varying confounding. The fact that our study produces findings consistent with prior retrospective studies regarding fluid balance should encourage further interest in evaluating different fluid resuscitation strategies in RCTs. Pending evidence from RCTs, our study provides evidence from rigorous causal analysis of high resolution retrospective data that mortality is decreased when a fluid cap of 6-10 L is maintained, with the greatest reduction at around 8L. This is broadly consistent with resuscitation volumes from the other retrospective studies above that show relatively lower mortality. As in any observational study, there is no guarantee that we adjusted for all confounding variables. However, we believe that we adjusted for the most important drivers of treatment decisions pertaining to fluids. A helpful exercise is to compare the results of our analysis to what we would expect to see if we failed to adjust for important confounders. We would expect unobserved confounding to lead to monotonically decreasing estimated mortality rates as fluid volume caps decreased, since healthier patients tend to receive lower fluid volumes. Indeed, an unadjusted analysis estimates that 4 L fluid volume caps lead to a great reduction in mortality. However, Fig. 3 illustrates that our adjusted analysis estimated the highest mortality for the lowest fluid volume caps, which is an encouraging (though not definitive) sign that we successfully adjusted for confounding.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 946, "end": 950, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 951, "end": 954, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 985, "end": 988, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 989, "end": 992, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 993, "end": 996, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1001, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2810, "end": 2816, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Other limitations to our study pertain to generalizability. First, this was a study of an ICU database at a single center and should be repeated with multicenter data. Second, to avoid bias, we had to exclude patients who violated any of our treatment strategies of interest (i.e., those who received over 4 L of fluid) before ICU admission. Our results are thus only applicable to the population of patients who arrive at the ICU without having already received large volumes of fluids. It is possible that effects of fluid caps would vary in the patients we omitted from our cohort. Third, we omitted patients with 0 L recorded pre-ICU fluid from our main analysis to guard against bias that might be induced by missing pre-ICU fluid data in this subpopulation. As a sensitivity analysis, we redid the analysis with these patients included and obtained qualitatively similar results (see Appendix E of Additional file 1). Fourth, we would ideally want to evaluate strategies governing treatment starting at sepsis onset, but because we only had detailed data beginning at ICU admission we focused on treatment decisions from that point onward. We mitigated this shortcoming by limiting our cohort to patients referred from the ED, which ensured that treatment had not begun too long before ICU admission for most patients in our sample. Finally, our data were collected from 2008 through 2012, and the effect of imposing fluid caps could have changed over time as fluid strategies have evolved.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We should also make the subtle point that our results are not necessarily estimates of the effects that would be observed if fluid caps were issued as guidelines. This is because we estimated the effect of abruptly cutting off fluids if physicians reached a (range of) threshold(s) after following usual care. If a guideline informed physicians of a fluid cap ahead of time, they may alter their treatment strategies in advance of reaching the cap in myriad ways (e.g., start vasopressors earlier, deliver lower volume boluses from time of admission, deliver less frequent boluses from time of admission, and administer maintenance fluid at a slower rate). If the distribution of treatment strategies in a world with a new guideline did not resemble the distribution of treatment strategies among patients whose care happened to be in accordance with that guideline in our data, then our results might not be good estimates of the outcomes that would be observed under the guideline. Thus, while our results are certainly evidence of benefit from fluid restrictive strategies, they do not point directly to specific guidelines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this cohort study using causal inference methods in a large critical care database, we found that 30-day mortality would have likely decreased relative to observed mortality under current practice if these patients had been subject to \"caps\" on the total volume of fluid administered between 6 and 10 L, with the greatest mortality reduction at a cap of 8 L.
