Even today new indications evolve due to the complex mode of action of these compounds. Due to the fear of side effects, especially irreversible retinopathy, their use is often limited. These side-effects, however, are a consequence of excessive daily dosages. An effective, safe therapy needs correct dosing, i. e. adherence to maximal daily dosages of 3.5(-4) mg chloroquine or 6(-6.5) mg hydroxychloroquine per kilogram ideal body weight. If the actual body weight is lower than the ideal body weight, this actual weight is used for the calculation of the dosage. Observing these limits allows a rather safe therapy of the diseases like lupus erythematosus, REM syndrome, porphyria cutanea tarda (2 \u03eb 125 mg chloroquine/week), cutaneous sarcoidosis and dermatomyositis. If standard therapies fail, then antimalarials can be tried to treat Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, granuloma annulare or erosive lichen planus. If therapy fails, either can be combined with quinacrine to increase their effectiveness.

The recommended dosages are based on clinically relevant information for each of the salts, i.e., chloroquine diphosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and not on the respective bases. The complex mechanism of action of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) has been discussed in more detail elsewhere [1, 2] . The drugs' effects are better explained by various factors than by a single one alone (Table 1) . CQ/HCQ have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative properties; they alleviate UV-induced inflammation, inhibit thrombocyte aggregation, enhance glucose tolerance, and cause increased porphyrin excretion. These are the effects that makes these substances useful for therapy. An important effect results from the \"lysosomotropic\" properties of CQ/HCQ which will be discussed in greater detail. CQ/HCQ are amphiphilic molecules (lipophilic ring structure, hydrophilic side chain, Figure 1 , 2). They thus tend to deposit in interphases, for instance, in phospholipid membranes.

These include drugs such as chloroquine, mefloquine, and halofantrine. This review focuses on chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and quinacrine, also known as Mepacrine \u00ae or Atabrine \u00ae . Quinacrine is a synthetic drug that was developed in 1930 and became the main antimalarial agent used by the Allies during the World War II. Chloroquine was developed in 1934 to replace quinine. Hydroxychloroquine is derived from chloroquine beta hydroxylation. It was first synthesized during the 1950s. Despite a few positive reports on successful use of older antimalarial drugs in the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), the usefulness of antimalarials was not more widely acknowledged until 1951 when a treatment series using quinacrine was published (17/18 of treated DLE patients improved). Since then these substances have also been successfully used to treat other non-infectious, inflammatory diseases. Their use is restricted, however, to malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Yet in recent decades, in dermatology in particular, antimalarial agents have been used successfully to treat a number of other diseases, and new uses continue to be found even today. The majority of studies on these drugs were performed decades ago, and thus current clinical studies using modern quality-based criteria are largely unavailable.

As a positively loaded molecule, CQ/HCQ lose their ability to pass through the membrane and thus accumulate there (factor 100-1000), primarily in macrophages and lysosomes. In the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria, intralysosomal proteases are thus inhibited, leading to heme accumulation which is toxic for the parasites. In human leukocyte lysosomes, the accumulation of antigens (low-affinity peptides) on the \"major histocompatibility complex\" as well as stimulation of Toll-like receptor 9 is inhibited. The processing of autoantigens in particular is diminished and is thus also decreased in subsequent immunological effects (Table 1) . These indirect effects on T cells enable these agents to be well combined with other immunomodulatory drugs. The delayed clinical effects may be explained by the fact that they primarily affect antigen-presenting cells. Quinacrine is a yellow acridine dye (CAS numbers: mepacrine = 83-89-6 quinacrine dihydrochloride = 69-05-6). It is no longer commercially available, but may be ordered through the pharmaceutical distributor Heinze in L\u00f6rrach, Germany, at http://www.pharmavertrieb-heinze.de/ which obtains the drug from England through BCM Specials at http://www.bcm-specials.co.uk/. Quinacrine is difficult to obtain. In other words, the concentration decreases rapidly at first and then more gradually. Depending on dosage and exponential decrease, the half-life of the drug can range from 74 hours to 50 days. To control compliance, plasma levels of HCQ or CQ concentrations in the hair may be measured. Quinacrine is eliminated slowly, 11 % by the kidneys. After discontinuing the drug, significant urine levels are still detectable for more than 2 months. 40-70 % of CQ is eliminated unaltered in the urine. Renal impairment thus significantly prolongs the half-life of the drug. CQ itself, and in low levels, HCQ, can cause about a 10% reduction in creatinine clearance. Especially in older patients, this can slow CQ excretion. Given CQ accumulation, the risk of side effects is higher in such patients and thus the dosage should be reduced accordingly. 25-40 % of CQ is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 in the liver into pharmacologically active metabolites. 5-10 % of CQ is excreted in stool. Drug plasma levels depend less on elimination than on reverse diffusion of the agents from the deep compartments in the plasma. Studies have reported that following a single dose, traces of CQ persisted in the plasma and erythrocytes for 56 days; after a two-month regime, there were still traces after 6-7 months in the skin but not in the plasma; and after long-term therapy, it continued to be found in the plasma, erythrocytes, and urine 5 years after the last dose.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 726, "end": 735, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The dose-effect relationship for CQ is not precisely defined.

The most feared complication of antimalarial drugs -irreversible retinopathy -depends neither on treatment duration nor on cumulative overall dose, but rather on whether the maximum daily dosage based on ideal body weight is exceeded. The maximum daily dosage is 3.5(-4) mg/kg of ideal body weight for chloroquine or 6(-6.5) mg/kg ideal body weight for hydroxychloroquine. If the maximum dosages are observed, retinopathy is not a concern, even with for therapy lasting several years [5, 6] . In a study with more than 900 patients (average length of treatment 7 years, cumulative dose of about 608 g), retinopathy only occurred at daily dosages \u0546 4 mg/kg chloroquine and \u0546 6.5 mg/kg hydroxychloroquine. Nevertheless, product information, such as provided with Resochin \u00ae , advises that in \"adults, cumulative dosages should not exceed 1 g chloroquine per kg of body weight (50-100 g total dose of chloroquine).\" For everyday clinical practice, given that CQ/HCQ are not stored in adipose tissue, dosages may be adjusted according to the patient's ideal body weight. For men: (height [in cm] -100) -10 %. For women: (height [in cm] -100) -15 %. If the patient's actual weight is below the ideal, then the dosage is adjusted according to the actual weight. To avoid retinopathy, the maximum daily dosage of 3.5-(4) mg/kg of chloroquine or 6-(6.5) mg/kg hydroxychloroquine should not be exceeded for longer periods of time. Short-term administration of higher daily dosages is not a problem. This may be necessary, for instance, giving an initial higher dosage for a few days to rapidly reach therapeutic blood levels (important note: increased side effects, possible misunderstanding) or if prescribing HCQ tablets that cannot be divided ( Table 2) . For patients with an ideal body weight of 63 kg who are given 1 CQ tablet per day (250 mg) the maximum dosage is thus 4 mg/kg ideal body weight. Patients with an ideal weight of 63-72 kg would be given a dosage of 3.5 to 4 mg/kg body weight of chloroquine. Only at heavier weights is the administration of 1 tablet or more per day unproblematic ( Table 2 , 3). Caution should be exercised when treating patients with an actual or ideal body weight of less than 63 kg.

There are still no hard-and-fast criteria for diagnosing chloroquine-associated retinopathy. Diagnosis is based on the subjective assessment of the examining physician. Although retinal damage is highly unlikely when ideal body weight is used to determine the maximum daily dose (see above), an ophthalmological examination (fundoscopy, vision field testing, color vision testing, Amsler grid test) is advised before beginning treatment or within the first few months of therapy as are annual controls -or semi-annual controls for patients over 65 or with renal or liver insufficiency [8] . The baseline examination is important for detecting central red scotomas which occur in up to 6 % of the healthy population. Scotoma can also occur in patients with systemic lupus, as a result of vasculitis, or in patients with anti-phospholipid syndrome or corticosteroid-induced diabetes. Careful surveillance is essential if the suggested dosages are exceeded as well as in older patients and patients on long-term continuous therapy (> 5 years). Self-testing with an Amsler grid test (once a month; Figure 2 ) is recommended for early detection [10] . According to British recommendations, ophthalmological examinations are not mandatory for HCQ if the maximum daily dosages are observed. Clinical controls during regular physician appointments (ask about scintillating scotomas, poor night vision, and difficulty reading or recognizing faces) and annual vision testing are advised. Consultation of an ophthalmologist is only recommended for specific problems or for treatment exceeding five years [11] . CQ deposits in the cornea and anterior stroma (30-70 %, only visible using a slit lamp) do not necessitate stopping treatment. They are less common in HCQ. Vision is not limited, and the condition is reversible after discontinuing the drug.
