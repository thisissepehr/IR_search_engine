Four of the patients had been treated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside as part of the cytostatic regimen, six had a central venous line and four patients had oral lesions prior to the infection. Selective gut decontamination consisted of co-trimoxazole/colistin in five patients and quinolones in three patients. The first three patients died, either due to interstitial pneumonia with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or due to infection-triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation despite prompt empiric antibiotic therapy including vancomycin. The other patients improved after empiric supplementation of penicillin G (30 Mega/day) to the antibiotic regimen. Beginning ARDS in two of these patients dramatically responded to high-dose steriods. We conclude that St. mitis is a major pathogen in neutropenic leukemic patients. Infection appears to occur independently of acute leukemic cell type, regimen of selective gut decontamination, venous access, visible oral lesions or treatment with highdose cytosine arabinoside. The clinical course of our patients raises questions about the value of commonly recommended empiric antibiotic regimens, which were clearly ineffective to control infections with St. mitis in this patient group. Our data indicate that immediate antibiotic therapy with penicillin G is indicated and may be life-saving for suspected St. mitis infections in neutropenic leukemic patients.",

Aggressive chemotherapeutic protocols containing high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HD-Ara-C), herpes-simplex infections of the oropharynx and the increasing use of quinolones for selective gut decontamination (SGD) are discussed as risk factors for the development of such infections [1, 2, 4 -6, 8, 10] . In 1988, we observed three cases of septicemia with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with acute leukemia. During drug-induced aplasia, fever developed and the patients received prompt antibiotic therapy commonly recommended for the empiric treatment of fever in immunocompromised patients. After isolation of St. mitis from blood cultures, therapy was supplemented with high-dose penicillin G (pen G), but this could not prevent fatal ARDS. In this report, we summarize our experience with eight episodes of septicemia caused by St. rnitis and discuss the importance of our findings for the empiric treatment of fever in leukemic patients.",

Two of these patients were transferred to the intensive care unit and required respirator therapy for 7 and 11 days, respectively. They died from ARDS and septic shock despite continuing antibiotic therapy including supplementation of pen G which was added immediately after St. mitis was isolated from blood cultures. Autopsy was performed in one patient and revealed an interstitial pneumonia, but no streptococci could be isolated from any part of the body. One patient died because of intrapulmonary hemorrhage associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In view of the distinct clinical picture, we added pen G (30 mega/day) to the empiric antibiotic regimen in the next patients with suspected septicemia.

Indeed, quinolones have limited activity against streptococci and do not often achieve sufficient tissue concentrations to prevent streptococcal infections.

The pathogenesis of this kind of ARDS in St. mitis septicemia is unknown. Vansteenkiste and Boogaerts [13] described 7 episodes of ARDS occurring in leukemic patients with long-standing and severe neutropenia. Three of these episodes were caused by viridarts streptococci. The authors suggest a possible role for certain arachidonic acid metabolites in the pathogenesis of ARDS in neutropenic patients. Guiot et al. [6] also pointed to the association of streptococcal infections and interstitial pneumonia. They assume that the infection initiates immunologic reactions damaging the lung with consecutive development of interstitial pneumonia. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in our patients no streptococci could be cultivated from various sites of the body after 2 days. In vitro, several antibiotics primarily used had sufficient activity against the isolated streptococci (data not shown).",

The patients treated immediately with methylprednisolone when signs of respiratory failure were apparent also showed dramatic improvement in their clinical condition, drop of temperature and improvement of respiratory function. We hypothesize that St. mitis septicemia induces ARDS in leukemic patients, which is triggered by immunological mechanisms that can be ameliorated or even prevented by the rapid bactericidal of pen G. As shown in Table 2 , only pen G had a 100\u00b070 bactericidal activity against all tested strains. In contrast, no bactericidal serum levels of vancomycin could be reached without serious toxicity in three of tested strains (recommended peak levels of vancomycin are < 30 ~tg/ml).",
