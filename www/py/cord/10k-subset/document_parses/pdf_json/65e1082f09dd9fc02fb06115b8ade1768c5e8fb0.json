            "text": "Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation,",

For datadriven learning, large-scale well-annotated datasets with representative data distribution characteristics are crucial to learning more accurate or generalizable models [5] , [4] . Unlike previous image datasets used in computer vision, ImageNet [1] offers a very comprehensive database of more than 1.2 million categorized natural images of 1000+ classes. The CNN models trained upon this database serve as the backbone for significantly improving many object detection and image segmentation problems using other datasets [6] , [7] , e.g., PASCAL [8] and medical image categorization [9] - [12] . However, there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet, as data acquisition is difficult, and quality annotation is costly.",

We further verify our hypothesis by inheriting and adapting rich hierarchical image features [5] , [33] from the large-scale ImageNet dataset for computer aided diagnosis (CAD). We also explore CNN architectures of the most studied seven-layered \"AlexNet-CNN\" [4] , a shallower \"Cifar-CNN\" [22] , and a much deeper version of \"GoogLeNet-CNN\" [33] (with our modifications on CNN structures). This study is partially motivated by recent studies [34] , [35] in computer vision.

Our experimental results suggest that different CNN architectures and dataset re-sampling protocols are critical for the LN detection tasks where the amount of labeled training data is sufficient and spatial contexts are local. Since LN images are more flexible than ILD images with respect to resampling and reformatting, LN datasets may be more readily augmented by such image transformations. As a result, LN datasets contain more training and testing data instances (due to data auugmentation) than ILD datasets. They nonetheless remain less comprehensive than natural image datasets, such as ImageNet. Fine-tuning ImageNet-trained models for ILD classification is clearly advantageous and yields early promising results, when the amount of labeled training data is highly insufficient and multi-class categorization is used, as opposed to the LN dataset's binary class categorization. Another significant finding is that CNNs trained from scratch or fine-tuned from ImageNet models consistently outperform CNNs that merely use off-the-shelf CNN features, in both the LN and ILD classification problems. We further analyze, via CNN activation visualizations, when and why transfer learning from non-medical to medical images in CADe problems can be valuable.",

There are 388 mediastinal LNs labeled by radiologists in 90 patient CT scans, and 595 abdominal LNs in 86 patient CT scans. To facilitate comparison, we adopt the data preparation protocol of [22] , where positive and negative LN candidates are sampled with the fields-of-view (FOVs) of 30 mm to 45 mm, surrounding the annotated and detected LN centers (obtained by a candidate generation process). More precisely, [22] , [41] , [36] follow a coarse-to-fine CADe scheme, partially inspired by [42] , which operates with detection recalls at the cost of approximately 40 false or negative LN candidates per patient scan. In this work, positive and negative LN candidate are first sampled up to 200 times with translations and rotations. Afterwards, negative LN samples are randomly re-selected at a lower rate close to the total number of positives. LN candidates are randomly extracted from fields-of-view (FOVs) spanning 35 mm to 128 mm in soft-tissue window . This allows us to capture multiple spatial scales of image context [43] , [44] ). The samples are then rescaled to a resolution via B-spline interpolation. A few examples of LNs with axial, coronal, and sagittal views encoded in RGB color images [22] are shown in Fig. 1 .",

Hence, the purely random image resampling (with respect to scale, displacement and orientation) and reformatting (the axial, coronal, and sagittal views are in any system randomly resampled coordinates) is a natural choice, which also happens to yield high CNN performance. Although we integrate three channels of information from three orthogonal views for LN detection, the pixel-wise spatial correlations between or among channels are not necessary. The convolutional kernels in the lower level CNN architectures can learn the optimal weights to linearly combine the observations from the axial, coronal, and sagittal channels by computing their dot-products. Transforming axial, coronal, and sagittal representations to RGB also facilitates transfer learning from CNN models trained on ImageNet.",

At the slice level, the objective is to classify the status of \"presence/absence\" of any of the six ILD classes for an input axial CT slice [40] . Characterizing an arbitrary CT slice against any possible ILD type, without any manual ROI (in contrast to [38] , [39] ), can be useful for large-scale patient screening. For slice-level ILD classification, we sampled the slices 12 times with random translations and rotations. After this, we balanced the numbers of CT slice samples for the six classes by randomly sampling several instances at various rates. For patch-based classification, we sampled up to 100 patches of size 64 64 from each ROI. This dataset is divided into five folds with disjoint patient subsets. The average number of CT slices (training instances) per fold is small, as shown in Table I . Slice-level ILD classification is a very challenging task where CNN models need to learn from very small numbers of training examples and predict ILD labels on unseen patients.",

More complex CNN models [22] , [52] have only about 150 K or 15 K parameters. Roth et al. [22] adopt the CNN architecture tailored to the Cifar-10 dataset [5] and operate on image windows of for lymph node detection, while the simplest CNN in [54] has only one convolutional, pooling, and FC layer, respectively. We use CifarNet [5] as used in [22] as a baseline for the LN detection. AlexNet [4] and GoogLeNet [33] are also modified to evaluate these state-of-the-art CNN architecture from ImageNet classification task [2] to our CADe problems and datasets. A simplified illustration of three CNN architectures exploited is shown in Fig. 5 . CifarNet always takes image patches as input while AlexNet and GoogLeNet are originally designed for the fixed image dimension of . We also reduced the filter size, stride and pooling parameters of AlexNet and GoogLeNet to accommodate a smaller input size of . We do so to produce and evaluate \"simplified\" AlexNet and GoogLeNet versions that are better suited to the smaller scale training datasets common in CADe problems.

Indeed, the Caltech101, Caltech256 and Cifar10 dataset merely contain images and 10 object classes. Furthermore, due to the large number (1000+) of object classes, the objects belonging to each ImageNet class category can be occluded, partial and small, relative to those in the previous public image datasets.

On the other hand, the mainstream deep CNN architectures (e.g., AlexNet and GoogLeNet) contain tens of millions of free parameters to train, and thus require sufficiently large numbers of labeled medical images.",

For the modified AlexNet-RI-L at (64 64) pixel resolution, we reduce the number of first layer convolution filters from 96 to 64 and reduce the stride from 4 to 2. For the modified GoogLeNet-RI (64 64), we decrease the number of first layer convolution filters from 64 to 32, the pad size from 3 to 2, the kernel size from 7 to 5, stride from 2 to 1 and the stride of the subsequent pooling layer from 2 to 1. We slightly reduce the number of convolutional filters in order to accommodate the smaller input image sizes of target medical image datasets [22] , [37] , while preventing over-fitting. This eventually improves performance on patch-based classification. CifarNet is used in [22] to detect LN samples of images. For consistency purposes, we down-sample resolution LN sample images to the dimension of . Results for lymph node detection in the mediastinum and abdomen are reported in Table II . FROC curves are illustrated in Fig. 8 . The area-under-the-FROC-curve (AUC) and true positive rate (TPR, recall or sensitivity) at three false positives per patient (TPR/3FP) are used as performance metrics. Of the nine investigated CNN models, CifarNet, AlexNet-ImNet and GoogLeNet-RI-H generally yielded the least competitive detection accuracy results. Our LN datasets are significantly more complex (i.e., display much larger within-class appearance variations), especially due to the extracted fields-of-view (FOVs) of (35 mm-128 mm) compared to (30 mm-45 mm) in [22] , where CifarNet is also employed. In this experiment, CifarNet is under-trained with respect to our enhanced LN datasets, due to its limited input resolution and parameter complexity. The inferior performance of AlexNet-ImNet implies that using the pre-trained ImageNet CNNs alone as \"off-the-shelf\" deep image feature extractors may not be optimal or adequate for mediastinal and abdominal LN detection tasks. To complement \"offthe-shelf\" CNN features, [10] , [9] , [12] all add and integrate various other hand-crafted image features as hybrid inputs for the final CADe classification.",

However, GoogLeNet-TL-H significantly improves upon GoogLeNet-RI-H (0.81 versus 0.61 TPR/3FP in mediastinum; 0.70 versus 0.48 TPR/3FP in abdomen).

This is also consistent with the findings reported for ILD detection in Table III and Fig. 11 . GoogLeNet-TL-H yields results similar to AlexNet-TL-H's for the mediastinal LN detection, and slightly outperforms Alex-Net-H for abdominal LN detection. AlexNet-RI-H exhibits less severe over-fitting than GoogLeNet-RI-H. We Many of our CNN models achieve notably better (FROC-AUC and TPR/3FP) results than the previous state-of-the-art models [36] for mediastinal LN detection: GoogLeNet-RI-L obtains an and 0.85 TPR/3FP, versus and 0.70 TPR/3FP [22] and 0.78 TPR/3FP [36] which uses stacked shallow learning. This difference lies in the fact that annotated lymph node segmentation masks are required to learn a mid-level semantic boundary detector [36] , whereas CNN approaches only need LN locations for training [22] . In abdominal LN detection, [22] obtains the best trade-off between its CNN model complexity and sampled data configuration. Our best performing CNN model is GoogLeNet-TL (256 256) which obtains an and 0.70 TPR/3FP.",

            "text": "The main difference between our dataset preparation protocol and that from [22] is a more aggressive extraction of random views within a much larger range of FOVs. The usage of larger FOVs to capture more image spatial context is inspired by deep zoom-out features [44] that improve semantic segmentation. This image sampling scheme contributes to our best reported performance results in both mediastinal LN detection (in this paper) and automated pancreas segmentation [45] . As shown in Fig. 1 , abdominal LNs are surrounded by many other similar looking objects. Meanwhile, mediastinal LNs are more easily distinguishable, due to the images' larger spatial contexts. Finally, from the perspective of the data-model trade-off: \"Do We Need More Training Data or Better Models?\" [51] , more abdomen CT scans from distinct patient populations need to be acquired and annotated, in order to take full advantage of deep CNN models of high capacity. Nevertheless, deeper and wider CNN models (e.g., GoogLeNet-RI-L and GoogLeNet-TL-H versus Cifar-10 [22] ) have shown improved results in the mediastinal LN detection. Fig. 9 provides examples of misclassified lymph nodes (in axial view) (both false negatives (Left) and false positives(Right)), from the Abdomen and Mediastinum datasets. The overall reported LN detection results are clinically significant, as indicated in [63] .",

All ILD images (patches of 64 64 and CT axial slices of 512 512) are re-sampled to a fixed dimension of . We evaluate the ILD classification task with five-fold CV on patient-level split, as it is more informative for real clinical performance than LOO. The classification accuracy rates for interstitial lung disease detection are shown in Table III . Two sub-tasks on ILD patch and slice classifications are conducted. In general, patch-level ILD classification is less challenging than slice-level classification, as far more data samples can be sampled from the manually annotated ROIs (up to 100 image patches per ROI), available from [37] . From Table III , all five deep models evaluated obtain comparable results within the range of classification accuracy rates . Their averaged model achieves a slightly better accuracy of 0.79. F1-scores [38] , [39] , [54] and the confusion matrix (Table V) for patch-level ILD classification using GoogLeNet-TL under five-fold cross-validation (we denote as Patch-CV5) are also computed. F1-scores are reported on patch classification only ( patches extracted from manual ROIs) [38] , [39] , [54] , as shown in Table IV . Both [38] and [39] use the evaluation protocol of \"leave-one-patient-out\" (LOO), which is arguably much easier and not directly comparable to 10-fold CV [54] or our Patch-CV5. In this study, we classify six ILD classes by adding a consolidation (CD) class to five classes of healthy (normal-NM), emphysema (EM), ground glass (GG), fibrosis (FB), and micronodules (MN) in [38] , [39] , [54] . Patch-CV10 [54] and Patch-CV5 report similar medium to high F-scores. This implies that the ILD dataset (although one of the mainstream public medical image datasets) may not adequately represent ILD disease CT lung imaging patterns, over a population of only 120 patients. Patch-CV5 yields higher F-scores than [54] and classifies the extra consolidation (CD) class.

[40] have argued that a new CADe protocol on holistic classification of ILD diseases directly, using axial CT slice attenuation patterns and CNN, may be more realistic for clinical applications. We refer to this as slice-level classification, as image patch sampling from manual ROIs can be completely avoided (hence, no manual ROI inputs will be provided). The experimental results in [40] are conducted with a patient-level hard split of 100 (training) and 20 (testing). The method's testing F-scores (i.e., Slice-Test) are given in Table IV . Note that the F-scores in [40] are not directly comparable to our results, due to different evaluation criteria. Only Slice-Test is evaluated and reported in [40] , and we find that F-scores can change drastically from different rounds of the five-fold CV.",

Even with the help of data augmentation (described in Section II), the classification accuracy of GoogLeNet-TL from Table III is only 0.57. However, transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained model is consistently beneficial, as evidenced by AlexNet-TL (0.46) versus AlexNet-RI (0.44), and GoogLeNet-TL (0.57) versus GoogLeNet-RI (0.41). It especially prevents GoogLeNet from over-fitting on the limited CADe datasets. Finally, when the cross-validation is conducted by randomly splitting the set of all 905 CT axial slices into five folds, markedly higher F-scores are obtained (Slice-Random in Table IV ). This further validates the claim that the dataset poorly generalizes ILDs for different patients. Fig. 10 shows examples of misclassified ILD patches (in axial view), with their ground truth labels and inaccurately classified labels.",

The main goal of this paper is to investigate the three factors (CNN architectures, dataset characteristics and transfer learning) that affect performance on a specific medical image analysis problem and to ultimately deliver clinically relevant results. For ILD classification, the most critical performance bottlenecks are the challenge of cross-dataset learning and the limited patient population size. We attempt to overcome these obstacles by merging the ILD [37] and LTRC datasets. Although the ILD [37] and LTRC datasets [64] (used in [19] ) were generated and annotated separately, they contain many common disease labels. For instance, the ILD disease classes emphysema (EM), ground glass (GG), fibrosis (FB), and micronodules (MN) belong to both datasets, and thus can be jointly trained/tested to form a larger and unified dataset.",

Evaluating a classifier on a biased validation set will cause unfair assessment of its performance. For instance, a classifier that predicts every image patch as \"non-LN\" will still achieve a 70% accuracy rate on a biased set with 3.5 times as many non-LN samples as LN samples. The classification accuracy results of GoogLeNet trained under two configurations are shown in Table VIII . Overall, it achieves lower accuracy results when trained with a \"biased prior\" in both tasks, and the accuracy difference for ILD patch-based classification is small. V.

Indeed, both datasets use full-size images. The traces of the training loss, validation loss and validation accuracy of AlexNet-RI and AlexNet-TL, are shown in Fig. 11 . For AlexNet-RI in Fig. 11(a) , the training loss significantly decreases as the number of training epochs increases, while the validation loss notably increases and the validation accuracy does not improve much before reaching a plateau. With transfer learning and fine-tuning, much better and consistent performances of training loss, validation loss and validation accuracy traces are obtained (see Fig. 11(b) ). We begin the optimization problem-that of fine-tuning the ImageNet pre-trained CNN to classify a comprehensive set of images-by initializing the parameters close to an optimal solution. One could compare this process to making adults learn to classify ILDs, as opposed to babies. During the process, the validation loss, having remained at lower values throughout, achieves higher final accuracy levels than the validation loss on a similar problem with random initialization. Meanwhile, the training losses in both cases decrease to values near zero. This indicates that both AlexNet-RI and AlexNet-TL over-fit on the ILD dataset, due to its small instance size. The quantitative results in Table III indicate that AlexNet-TL and GoogLeNet-TL have consistently better classification accuracies than AlexNet-RI and GoogLeNet-RI, respectively.",

The last pooling layer activation map summarizes the entire input image by highlighting which relative locations or neural reception fields relative to the image are activated. There are a total of 256 (6 6) reception fields in AlexNet [4] . Pooling units where the relative image location of the disease region is present in the image are highlighted with green boxes. Next, we reconstruct the original ILD images using the process of de-convolution, back-propagating with convolution and un-pooling from the activation maps of the chosen pooling units [72] . From the reconstructed images (Fig. 13 bottom) , we observe that with fine-tuning, AlexNet-TL detects and localizes objects of interest (ILD disease regions depicted in in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)) better than AlexNet-ImNet. The filters shown in Fig. 13 that better localize regions on the input images (Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)) respectively, produce relatively higher activations (in the top 5%) among all 512 reception field responses in the fine-tuned AlexNet-TL model. As observed in [73] , the final CNN classification score can not be driven solely by a single strong activation in the receptions fields, but often by a sparse set of high activations (i.e., varying selective or sparse activations per input image).",

Previously, CNN models used in medical image analysis applications have often been orders of magnitude smaller. \u2022 The trade-off between using better learning models and using more training data [51] should be carefully considered when searching for an optimal solution to any CADe problem (e.g., mediastinal and abdominal LN detection). \u2022 Limited datasets can be a bottleneck to further advancement of CADe. Building progressively growing (in scale), well annotated datasets is at least as crucial as developing new algorithms. This has been accomplished, for instance, in the field of computer vision. The well-known scene recognition problem has made tremendous progress, thanks to the steady and continuous development of Scene-15, MIT Indoor-67, SUN-397 and Place datasets [58] . \u2022 Transfer learning from the large scale annotated natural image datasets (ImageNet) to CADe problems has been consistently beneficial in our experiments. This sheds some light on cross-dataset CNN learning in the medical image domain, e.g., the union of the ILD [37] and LTRC datasets [64] , as suggested in this paper. \u2022 Finally, applications of off-the-shelf deep CNN image features to CADe problems can be improved by either exploring the performance-complementary properties of hand-crafted features [10] , [9] , [12] , or by training CNNs from scratch and better fine-tuning CNNs on the target medical image dataset, as evaluated in this paper.",
