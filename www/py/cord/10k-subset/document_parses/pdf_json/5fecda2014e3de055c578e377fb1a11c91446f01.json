            "text": "Muscle contraction is caused by the action of myosin motors within the structural confines of contractile unit arrays. When the force generated by cyclic interactions between myosin crossbridges and actin filaments is greater than the average load shared by the crossbridges, sliding of the actin filaments occurs and the muscle shortens. The shortening velocity as a function of muscle load can be described mathematically by a hyperbola; this characteristic force-velocity relationship stems from stochastic interactions between the crossbridges and the actin filaments. Beyond the actomyosin interaction, there is not yet a unified theory explaining smooth muscle contraction, mainly because the structure of the contractile unit in smooth muscle (akin to the sarcomere in striated muscle) is still undefined. In this review, functional and structural data from airway smooth muscle are analyzed in an engineering approach of quantification and correlation to support a model of the contractile unit with characteristics revealed by mathematical analyses and behavior matched by experimental observation.",

At the heart of the muscle \"engine\" are the myosin motors or crossbridges which are able to harness energy derived from adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis to drive their cyclic interactions with actin filaments leading to muscle contraction. Morphologically, the myosin molecules of striated and smooth muscle are indistinguishable. After they are activated, myosin crossbridges of smooth muscle interact with actin filaments in a qualitatively similar manner as their counterparts do in striated muscle [1, 2] . The hyperbolic function which characterizes the force-velocity relationship in striated muscle [3] also describes the same relationship very well in smooth muscle [4] [5] [6] . This is taken as evidence suggesting that the molecular mechanism of the actomyosin interaction seen in striated muscle is also operative in smooth muscle.",

            "text": "A key difference between smooth and striated muscle appears to be in the myosin filament structure. Unlike the bipolar filaments found in striated muscle [7] , myosin filaments in smooth muscle are likely side-polar [8] [9] [10] . This difference in the filament structure means that the contractile-unit structure in smooth muscle should be different from that of a striated muscle sarcomere, as envisioned by Craig and Megerman [8] and Hodgkinson et al. [11] ; that is, a side-polar filament with crossbridges having the same polarity along the entire length of one side of the filament and opposite polarity on the other side and when interacting with actin filaments of matching polarities, pulling the actin filaments to slide in opposite directions (Fig. 1) . The actin filaments (with a myosin filament sandwiched in between) are assumed to attach to dense bodies (equivalent to the Z-disks in striated muscle), thus forming a functional contractile unit, at least in theory. In this review, functional and structural data from airway smooth muscle are analyzed with the help of mathematical models to test the validity of the side-polar contractile unit model. Mathematical models are also used to relate changes in force-velocity properties to changes in the kinetics of actomyosin crossbridge cycle and to explain why myosin filaments in smooth muscle, unlike those in striated muscle, do not have the same length.",

However, later measurements show that a is not a constant and the hyperbolic relationship between muscle force and shortening velocity is not a direct and simple reflection of energy utilization in the cell [12] . Therefore, the Hill equation for many decades had been used as an empirical equation for fitting force-velocity data from muscle experiments and was thought to have no connection whatsoever with the molecular mechanism of contraction [13] , until recently. What changed our perception on the Hill equation and its physiological meaning is the recognition by Seow [14] that there is a direct linkage between the hyperbolic equation and Huxley's crossbridge models of muscle contraction [15, 16] .",

The Hill equation is therefore a description of the Huxley crossbridge model under steady-state conditions when the muscle is not shortening against extreme high-loads. At intermediate range of loads where a muscle is operating at or near its maximal power and perhaps where the loads are most physiologically relevant, the Hill equation and the Huxley model are the same in terms of their mathematical expression and the associated insights into the molecular mechanisms. The Hill equation is therefore no longer just an empirical tool but contains mechanistic information of the crossbridge cycle. For example, because K is related to the curvature of a force-velocity curve [14] , an increase in K will decrease the curvature and thus increase the relative power output of the muscle. Because K \u00bc f APP /k (Eq. (12)), we now know that an increase in muscle power can result from an increase in the apparent attachment rate (f APP ) and/or a decrease in k, or in other words, a decrease in the dependence of the apparent detachment rate (g APP ) on shortening velocity. The Hill equation is related not only to the Huxley two-state model [15] , but also to multi-state models [14] . Hill and Huxley were contemporaries and had a close personal and professional relationship. Undoubtedly many of their conversations were about theories of muscle contraction. Unfortunately, data on the molecular basis of force-velocity relations [17] were not available in their time for them to make the connection between their most important contributions to the understanding of muscle physiology.

Although there is anecdotal evidence supporting such a model [21, 22] , structural and functional details of the model have yet to be substantiated. The distinct features in the length-force relationship of striated muscle (shown in gray in Fig. 4 ) stem directly from physical limitations associated with the unique sarcomeric structure of the muscle [23] ; in other words, the sarcomeric structure determines the length-force relationship. The contractile-unit model for smooth muscle (Fig. 3(a) ) predicts that the ascending limb of the length-force curve should be a straight line without a kink (Fig. 3b) , unlike that of striated muscle (Fig. 4, gray lines) where a kink in the ascending portion of the curve is evident due to the encounter of the myosin filament with the Z-disk of the sarcomere during excessive shortening. Without a Z-disk in the smooth muscle contractile unit which contains dense bodies instead, such a kink is not expected in the length-force relationship of smooth muscle. Herrera et al. [22] tested the model (Fig. 3(a) ) by measuring the lengths of airway smooth muscle at different isotonic loads while minimizing length adaptation during the measurement and confirmed that indeed, the ascending limb of the length-force curve in the muscle was a straight line (solid line and open circles, Fig. 4 ). The obvious lack of a kink in the ascending limb of the length-force curve indicates that the sarcomeric structure seen in striated muscle is unlikely to be present in smooth muscle; and furthermore, the data (Fig. 4) are consistent with the model shown in Fig. 3(a) .",

That is, the number of working crossbridges decreases as a muscle shortens. This means that the load shared by each crossbridge will increase as contraction proceeds even if the muscle is shortening against a constant load. The increasing load per crossbridge (due to the reduction in filament overlap and the resulting decrease in the working crossbridge number) will result in a continuous decrease in the overall shortening velocity of the muscle, if the model is correct.

Detailed analysis by Syyong et al.

In fact, the exponential distribution suggests that myosin filaments in smooth muscle exist because of a dynamic equilibrium between two opposing processes, i.e., those of filament formation (polymerization of dimers by adding and subtracting the dimers at both ends of a filament) and fragmentation of existing filaments.",

At the relatively high physiological ionic strength of 200 mM, there is virtually no filament formation of smooth muscle myosin in vitro [28] . An intriguing question is why myosin filaments exist in smooth muscle cells. The answer could lie in the fact that myosin filament formation in smooth muscle occurs within the actin filament lattices, which are known to facilitate assembly of myosin filaments [29, 30] . Many of the actin-filament-associated proteins such as caldesmon are also known to facilitate myosin filament assembly [31] perhaps due to their affinity to myosin molecules (see a review by Seow [32] ). Recruitment of myosin molecules into the relatively restricted space of an actin filament lattice could be the catalytic step leading to myosin filament formation at physiological ionic strength. Within the lattice myosin molecules are not likely to form a long and unbroken filament as that shown in Fig. 3 (a) but likely are in the form of filament segments lined up end-to-end as that shown in Fig. 6(b) , with a length distribution governed by an exponential decay function ( Fig. 6(a) ). Interestingly, if we only allow myosin polymerization and depolymerization to occur at the ends of a filament in the modeling, then a Gaussian distribution of the filament lengths appears [26] . The fact that exponential distribution is observed indicates that spontaneous fragmentation of a filament is not restricted to the two ends of the filament.",

A link between the Hill equation and the Huxley crossbridge model can be established only through mathematical analysis. With such a link, kinetics of the actomyosin interaction at a molecular level can be revealed by measuring force-velocity properties of a muscle at the tissue level. The hypothetical model of the smooth muscle contractile unit ( Fig. 6(b) ) now has an additional piece of supporting evidence because of mathematical modeling. The exponential distribution of myosin filament lengths in smooth muscle is not just a statement of experimental observation; with mathematical analysis, it allows us to speculate on the mechanism of myosin filament formation in a side-polar fashion and indirectly refutes the bipolar model (which is adopted by striated muscles) as the blue-print for myosin filaments of smooth muscle.",
