Substitution of lysine residues at positions 43 and 44 with glycine residues has been shown to destroy the pat7 motif and prevents the nuclear localization of N. In the current study, the NLS motif was modified to \"PGGGNKK\" to knock out the nuclear function of N using a full-length infectious cDNA clone. NLS-null mutant virus was obtained and compared with the wild-type virus for phenotypic changes in cells and pigs. The NLS-null virus was stable in cell culture and grew to a titer of 100-fold lower than wild-type virus. Pigs infected with the NLSnull virus exhibited a reduced severity of disease with milder viremia and higher neutralizing antibody and ELISA antibody titers than wild-type virus-infected pigs. Strong selection pressure for reversion at the NLS locus was observed during viremia and persistence in pigs.

The average duration of viremia was also higher in the P129-WT than in the P129-GG group, while the mock-infected pigs remained negative for PRRSV throughout the study. The appearance of anti-PRRSV antibody was monitored in sera using a commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX). Antibody was first detectable at 7 days postinoculation and continued to increase throughout the study. The mean S/P ratio in the P129-GG group remained consistently higher than that of the P129-WT group in spite of the lower level of viremia in the P129-GG group. Serum neutralization (SN) titers against PRRSV were also determined. The mean titer in the P129-GG group increased dramatically between 14 and 28 days. By the end of the study, the average neutralization titer in the P129-GG group was approximately five times higher than in the P129-WT group (Table  1) . One pig in the P129-GG group exhibited viremic and serologic patterns similar to those of animals in the P129-WT group, and a possible reversion of P129-GG was suspected. Viral plaques were prepared from serum of this pig and the N gene was amplified by RT-PCR. Of 10 plaques examined, only 1 plaque retained the original NLS sequence of P129-GG, and 9 plaques were all reverted to the wild-type sequence (Fig. 2) . No other mutation was detected elsewhere in the N gene, suggesting strong and specific selection pressure at the NLS locus.

The NLS-null P129-GG virus was generated using an infectious cDNA clone, demonstrating that NLS is nonessential for virus infectivity. The NLS-null virus grew to a titer 2 logs lower than the wild-type virus. In pigs, the NLS-null virus induced shorter duration viremia and lower virus titers in comparison to the wildtype infected pigs. Despite the reduced level of viremia, higher levels of ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in the NLS-null virus infected pigs. The ability of the NLS-null virus to induce higher level antibodies suggests a possible role of N in the host response modulation. Reversions at the NLS locus occurred in pigs during viremia, and N proteins from the revertants were found to localize in the nucleus. The data suggest that the PRRS virus N protein may play an important role in viral pathogenesis. This unique property of N may be associated with an evasion strategy of PRRS virus from the host defenses.
