Although it would be comforting to consider laboratory-acquired infection an artifact of a less sophisticated time in biomedical research, recent examples refute this. In 2001, for example, a public health laboratory worker in the U.S. acquired cutaneous anthrax due to an unauthorized switch in disinfectants (MMWR, 2002) . In 2004, one of the last known deaths caused by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-associated coronavirus was that of the mother of a researcher who had acquired SARS in a Beijing laboratory and transmitted it to her (Normille, 2004) . Again, the cause was likely an unauthorized or untested procedure to inactivate the virus. Also in 2004, a sample of Bacillus anthracis was presumably inactivated in a laboratory in New biosafety technologies and associated evolving guidelines have emerged to significantly improve ways to safely handle microbiological material. In addition, a better understanding of the risks associated with various manipulations of many agents transmissible by different routes has facilitated our ability to apply appropriate biosafety practices to specific laboratory arenas.

However, over time, bleach can be corrosive and will pit stainless steel surfaces, thus the use of bleach should be followed by a water rinse on these surfaces. In addition, the dilution must be prepared daily due to the rapid degradation of hypochlorite ions over time. Another common disinfectant is 70% isopropyl alcohol. Although quite effective at inactivating several classes of microbes, its use on work surfaces results in nearly immediate evaporation, which does not allow for the contact time necessary required for inactivation. When using commercially available products, the label, the product information sheet, and the material safety data sheet must be reviewed to determine appropriate use.

When the application of administrative and engineering controls and work practices is not sufficient to protect against exposure, PPE is used to provide an additional and/or redundant layer of protection. The goal of PPE is two-fold: (1) PPE provides a barrier to possible routes of entry on a worker's body and (2) PPE protects street clothing and shoes so that laboratory contaminants are not inadvertently taken from the laboratory into a nonresearch area, such as a worker's home. The use of protective clothing such as buttoned labcoats or back-closing gowns and gloves are commonplace in today's research laboratory. The use of these items is appropriate even during research of minimal biosafety concern. Face protection, such as a face shield or a combination of goggles plus a surgical mask afford protection to the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. In certain circumstances, shoe or hair covers may be required. The use of respirators may be required in settings where airborne transmission is possible. (Note: any use of respiratory protection must follow an institutional Respiratory Protection Program. Institutional industrial hygienists or environmental health professionals must be consulted prior to using a respirator). PPE must be selected carefully for the work to be performed. For example, most gloves are suitable for creating a barrier against biological agents, but they may not be compatible with research chemicals. Some materials found in PPE may contain allergens, such as latex, that can stimulate health problems for allergic personnel. PPE must be put on (donned) in the laboratory and removed (doffed) prior to leaving the work area. Taking off PPE must be performed carefully to avoid contaminating skin or street clothes.

Liquid waste may be autoclaved or may be inactivated using a liquid disinfectant-refer to manufacturer's information for appropriate dilutions and minimum contact time. In most locations, inactivated liquid waste can be disposed into the sanitary sewer via the laboratory sink; however, it is imperative to confirm that this is acceptable for each institution. Solid waste is generally placed in autoclavable bags, which are contained in a collection container labeled with the international biohazard symbol. This waste can be autoclaved at the laboratory or collected for treatment by the institution or a contractor prior to final disposal. It must be verified that autoclaves and other treatment methods inactivate biological organisms through periodic validation tests with biological indicators. Actual records of this testing or confirmation from contractors must be kept in the laboratory or by the institution.

The response to each of these will depend on the individual and institutional circumstances of the research and are too varied and numerous to discuss here. An appropriate exercise for each laboratory director to perform is to establish procedures for \"what to do when\" for each of the above and other potential disruptions that might occur.

When ready to clean, a layer of absorbent material such as paper towels can be placed gently on top of the spill, followed by an application of an appropriately diluted disinfectant starting at the perimeter of the spill and working towards the center.
