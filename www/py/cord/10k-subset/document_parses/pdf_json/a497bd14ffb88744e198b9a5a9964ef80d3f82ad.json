The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gossypol on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. Methods Male BALB/c mice were pretreated with gossypol 1 h before intranasal instillation of LPS. Then, 7 h after LPS administration, the myeloperoxidase in histology of lungs, lung wet/dry ratio and inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b) in the BALF were measured by ELISA. The extent of phosphorylation of IjB-a, p65 NF-jB, p46-p54 JNK, p42-p44 ERK, and p38 were detected by western blot. Results Gossypol markedly attenuated the LPS-induced histological alterations in the lung and inhibited the production of TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6. Additionally, gossypol reduced the inflammatory cells in BALF, decreased the wet/dry ratio of lungs and inhibited the phosphorylation of IjB-a, p65 NF-jB, p46-p54 JNK, p42-p44 ERK, and p38 caused by LPS. Conclusion The data suggest that anti-inflammatory effects of gossypol against the LPS-induced ALI may be due to its ability of inhibition of the NF-jB and MAPKs signaling pathways.

In this study, we evaluated the W/D ratio of the lung to quantify the magnitude of pulmonary edema. Our experiments showed that gossypol significantly inhibits edema of the lung, as shown by a W/D ratio in the gossypol group that was significantly lower than the LPS group.
