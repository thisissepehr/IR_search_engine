In 2009 serologic responses to either pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccine (n = 36) or pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection (n = 2) were studied in 38 HSCT recipients. Methods Responses were measured with a standard hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Fourteen patients had active chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) at the time of vaccination/infection and seven patients had cGvHD in remission; 11 patients had no immunosuppressive therapy, and 27 patients were on immunosuppressive therapy. Nineteen patients (53%) responded to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination.

While vaccine responders had no or single agent immunosuppressive therapy, non-responders frequently received moderate or intense immunosuppressive therapy. All vaccine recipients previously treated with rituximab were nonresponders. Conclusions In summary, the overall response to pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination in HSCT recipients was modest.
