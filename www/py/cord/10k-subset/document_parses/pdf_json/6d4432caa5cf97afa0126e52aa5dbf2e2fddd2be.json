Disease can result in poor feed conversion, reduced weight gain, and can lead to the development of necrotic enteritis. For prevention of coccidiosis, poultry are commonly vaccinated with a live, sporulated oocysts mass applied with a vaccination cabinet in the hatchery. Traditionally, coccidia vaccines have been applied by coarse spray in a water based diluent, however, new technology using gel diluents has entered the US market. Gel diluents can have variable viscosities and are \"dropped\" onto chicks with an applicator bar. It is thought that gel droplets remain intact on the birds for longer than water based droplets, allowing more time for preening and ingestion of oocysts. In this experiment, the efficacy of a commercial coccidia vaccine applied with a water based diluent, a more viscous gel diluent, and a less viscous gel diluent was compared.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Fecal samples were collected at multiple time points post-vaccination to quantify vaccine oocyst shedding. Shedding in the first cycle (days 5 to 8 post-vaccination) was related to the number of oocysts received from each application method, where the groups receiving higher doses shed more oocysts. However, a decrease in shedding was seen for the more viscous gel group in the second cycle (days 12 to 15 post-vaccination). Chickens were challenged with Eimeria maxima oocysts and 7 days post-challenge body weight gains and gross and microscopic lesions were recorded to evaluate protection levels for the different vaccine applications. All vaccinated groups appeared to be protected based on body weight gain and lesion scoring. The results of this project indicate that all vaccine applications are effective at protecting against Eimeria maxima challenge when using a proper dose of vaccine that allows for repeated oocyst cycling in the litter post-vaccination.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coccidiosis is an enteric disease of commercial poultry caused by Eimeria, which are coccidian species belonging to the apicomplexan phylum.

For every oocyst ingested, it is estimated that several hundred thousand may be produced, which are then available for ingestion and infection of other chickens in the poultry house (Sharman et al., 2010) . Historically, coccidiosis has been treated via the use of anticoccidials, including ionophores and chemicals. Although anticoccidial treatments are effective in protecting against disease outbreaks, development of drug resistance, current external pressures on the industry, and regulatory changes have producers turning towards vaccination (Shirley et al., 2007; Newman, 2012; Blake and Tomley, 2014; Chapman, 2014) . Coccidia vaccines contain live, sporulated oocysts of varying mixtures and concentrations of Eimeria species, and they are given in a low dose to initiate an immunologic response in the bird (Danforth, 1998; Williams, 2002; Tewari and Maharana, 2011) . Unlike other coccidian parasites, infection with Eimeria is self-limiting, as oocysts produced in the intestine are not capable of auto-infection of the host chicken and must be excreted and re-ingested for further infection (Cowper et al., 2012; Wilhelm and Yarovinsky, 2014) . The immune response to Eimeria infection is species specific and requires multiple exposures to oocysts of each Eimeria sp. to achieve sufficient protective immunity (Rose and Hesketh, 1979) .

Vaccine coverage is essential, as chicks that do not ingest oocysts at day of hatch will later be exposed to oocysts in the litter, and this higher dose of oocysts can result in clinical infection and gut lesions. Gel vaccination technology for coccidia has been posited as an alternative to spray vaccination. Gel beads containing Eimeria oocysts have been shown to be protective when delivered in the feed (Danforth et al., 1997; Jenkins et al., 2012; Jenkins et al., 2013) . Now, coccidia vaccines in gel diluents are being applied to day-old chicks at the hatchery with a gel applicator bar (Ritzi et al., 2016) . There are multiple manufacturers of gel diluents as well as multiple viscosities of individual gel products. Some gels are only slightly more viscous than water, but create more stable droplets on the chicks when applied. Other gels are extremely viscous and create very defined and gelatinous drops on chicks. The higher viscosity of gel diluents compared to water spray may increase the available vaccine for ingestion. Now that alternative methods for coccidia vaccine application are in use, research is needed to confirm that vaccines are still as efficacious with these new application methods as with traditional application. This study aimed to compare the same commercial vaccine applied by the traditional spray method and using a gel application method with both high and low viscosity gels.

This controlled vaccination method also produced the least variation of total oocyst shedding numbers in the first cycle, as all chickens vaccinated were ensured to receive a proper vaccine dose. The spray, MV gel, and LV gel methods require chicks to actively ingest oocysts both from preening and from pecking in the hatchery basket, resulting in a potential loss of vaccine. Both gel vaccines produced less variation in oocyst shedding during the first cycle compared to the variation seen in the spray vaccinated group, perhaps indicating that the gel beads provide a more stable vehicle for vaccine delivery than a liquid spray.

In addition, the spray, gavage, and less viscous gel groups all had lower variation within the groups for oocyst shedding in the second cycle, and all coefficient of variation values for those groups were very similar. This decrease in variation compared to the first cycle of oocyst shedding may be attributed to the exposure of chickens that did not receive vaccine to the sporulated oocysts in the litter from the first cycle of shedding, leading to more consistent infection and shedding of all birds within the groups. However, the birds vaccinated by the more viscous gel method were shedding significantly lower numbers of total oocysts than the other vaccinated groups, although 100% of the birds in that group were shedding oocysts at all time points except for day 12. Although the temperature of each colony room that each group was held in remained consistent, it is possible that there was reduced humidity in the more viscous gel room, leading to lower sporulation rates of the oocysts shed in the first cycle and therefore lower doses of oocysts ingested by those birds, however this is only speculation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Like the data for the first cycle of E. maxima oocyst shedding, the numbers of oocysts shed during the second cycle were quite low in all groups except for day 15, when the spray group was shedding significantly higher oocysts per gram than the other groups.

In future experiments, further performance analysis could be performed to better understand the effect of coccidia vaccination on body weight gain. Following challenge, the mean body weight gains of the vaccinated groups were not significantly different from the non-challenge controls, indicating protection. The mean body weight of the negative control group was significantly increased compared to the non-vaccinated challenged control group, showing that the challenge had an influence on body weight for non-vaccinated birds.

However, interpretation of these scores is difficult, considering that the birds were all kept on litter during the 7 days postchallenge, and could have continued to cycle vaccine oocysts during this time, rendering it nearly impossible to distinguish between vaccine and challenge oocysts present in the mid-intestine. Although the positive challenge control group did not differ significantly in oocyst count and microscopic lesion scores from the vaccinated/challenged groups, it is possible that the E. maxima scored for the positive control assays was present from challenge, whereas the E. maxima seen in the vaccinated/challenge groups may have been from vaccine.
