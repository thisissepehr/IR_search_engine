Endemic areas exhibit wide variations regarding severe disease frequency. This study, conducted simultaneously in Brazil and India, constitutes, to our knowledge, the first multisite study focused on clinical characterization of P. vivax severe disease. Methods: Patients admitted with P. vivax mono-infection at reference centers in Manaus (Amazon -Brazil) and Bikaner (Rajasthan -India), where P. vivax predominates, were submitted to standard thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations in order to characterize clinical manifestations and identify concurrent co-morbidities. Results: In total, 778 patients (88.0% above 12 years old) were hospitalized at clinical discretion with PCR-confirmed P. vivax mono-infection (316 in Manaus and 462 in Bikaner), of which 197 (25.3%) presented at least one severity criterion as defined by the World Health Organization (2010). Hyperlactatemia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were more frequent in Manaus. Noteworthy, pregnancy status was associated as a risk factor for severe disease (OR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.2-3.4; P = 0.007). The overall case fatality rate was 0.3/1,000 cases in Manaus and 6.1/1,000 cases in Bikaner, with all deaths occurring among patients fulfilling at least one severity criterion. Within this subgroup, case fatality rates increased respectively to 7.5% in Manaus and 4.4% in Bikaner. Conclusion: P. vivax-associated severity is not negligible, and although lethality observed for complicated cases was similar, the overall fatality rate was about 20-fold higher in India compared to Brazil, highlighting the variability observed in different settings.

We also classified patients according to the number of severe criteria fulfilled as a proxy of higher severity, for which more specific and easier applicable criteria [7] were used: severe anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL in adults and <5 g/dL in children); respiratory distress/ acute lung injury; circulatory shock (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg refractory to fluid); acute renal failure; and cerebral malaria. A cut-off was decided to categorize cases as more severe if they presented three or more severe criteria. The performance of additional investigations for comorbidities was triggered either for specific manifestations and/or at the physician's discretion. These criteria included: i) severe anemia: hemoglobinopathies investigation and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) assessments, and abdominal ultrasound; ii) respiratory distress: chest X-rays, blood gas, chest computerized tomography (CT) scan, and blood cultures; iii) ALT. 200 U/L: serology against hepatitis A, hepatitis E (only in India), and dengue; iv) creatinine > 3 mg/dL: renal ultrasound, 24-h proteinuria measurement and creatinine clearance; v) cerebral malaria: CT scan and lumbar puncture (if not contraindicated); and vi) severe abdominal pain: abdominal ultrasound.

Furthermore, although we have tried to ascertain the presence of previous chronic co-morbidities through medical interviews and patient record revisions, the possibility of underreporting and underdiagnosis must be considered. Indeed, one of the main concerns of the protocol was to exclude misdiagnosis and co-infection with P. falciparum by applying validated and standardized molecular methods [33] , as microscopy can frequently miss out or even misdiagnose a varied proportion of cases. Our data provide yet again a robust confirmation of the potential of this species to cause significant morbidity and even mortality, a fact now widely recognized by the scientific community and by WHO in its recently published severe malaria monograph [37] .

These findings must be taken cautiously, as the low incidence of P. falciparum in the study areas and the hospital-based design can limit comparisons and estimates of community CFRs.

The influence of these factors could already be observed by comparing the descriptions of clinical epidemiology of complications associated with this infection from different sites, showing that in areas of higher transmission intensities, children are the most frequently affected population [18, 19, 39, 40] , while in areas of moderate and low intensities, adults contribute more to the proportion of severe cases [7, 14, 41] . Our study highlighted many of these differences. For instance, when comparing patients hospitalized at both sites, there was evidence that the higher proportion of patients being admitted in India was secondary to a higher frequency of first malarial infections in that location, reflecting distinctive transmission dynamics, including a differential pattern of relapse rates that could contribute to some degree of clinical immunity among Brazilian patients [42, 43] . The spectrum of clinical complications in both sites was broadly similar, with severe anemia being by far the most frequent of the complications, as previously described in other P. vivax endemic settings [14, 17, 18, 44] , and followed by acute renal failure, a complication that seems to be particularly frequent in the two countries where the study was conducted albeit rare elsewhere [37] . The presence of three or more severity criteria was also frequent and common at both sites. The proportion of severe malaria cases with acute lung injury/respiratory distress was, however, significantly higher among Brazilian patients. This particular difference could be due to a number of factors, including a higher proportion of Indian patients being systematically treated with antibiotics, or differences in parasite virulence or host genetics, which could not be assessed in this study and should be considered in future studies. However, our data point to the beginning of antimalarial treatment as a triggering phenomenon of respiratory distress, which needs further investigation.

One of the most striking findings in this study was the confirmation that pregnancy seems to be a clear risk factor for severe vivax malaria and even for death (despite being only borderline significant). It has been argued that, unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax rarely causes severe malaria in pregnant women [37, [46] [47] [48] ; however, our series confirms a very high and almost identical proportion (above 2/3 in both sites) of pregnancies among the cases of severe malaria occurring in women of reproductive age, and four maternal deaths (all occurring in Bikaner). Pregnant women were systematically evaluated for obstetric complications, allowing us to diagnose an abortion occurring as a consequence of a subchorionic hematoma which we attributed to a malaria-related complication, leading us to hypothesize that further studies aimed at this population could properly detect and estimate the pregnancy-related burden of P. vivax infection. We were also able to detect the frequent occurrence of pregnancyrelated complications such as subchorionic hematoma. On the other hand, the histopathological evidence in the literature points to minor damage of P. vivax-infected placentas [49, 50] .

Bacterial systemic concurrent infections were rarely observed in Manaus, which could be a potential reflection that among adult patients the concomitant occurrence of bacterial infection seems much rarer than that among P. falciparum-infected children [56] . Yet other studies have reported similar rates affecting both age groups [57] , in which factors associated with each setting could be playing a higher role, a topic we could not explore due to the systematic use of antibiotics in Bikaner. There were, however, important differences in the prevalence of co-morbidities in Manaus and Bikaner, with the former presenting considerably higher frequencies of both acute and chronic illnesses. The difference in the observed proportions of co-morbidities between malaria endemic areas is a reflection of the local epidemiology influenced by the demographic and socioeconomic structures, and also of the health systems' capacities to diagnose and detect concomitant illnesses. Previous studies from the Brazilian Amazon region had already described the joint occurrence of malaria simultaneously with other health conditions, either acting as a contributing factor for severe manifestation or eventually being an incidental finding in patients with other severe diseases leading to critical illness or even fatal outcomes [14, 25, 58] . In a scenario where many tropical regions are facing epidemiological transition, the occurrence of P. vivax infection in individuals with chronic diseases is likely to become an important problem in these areas [59] [60] [61] , putting a great deal of stress on and requiring effective recognition and management by local health systems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 209, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 210, "end": 214, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 215, "end": 219, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 220, "end": 224, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 393, "end": 397, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 652, "end": 656, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 731, "end": 735, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1727, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1731, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1735, "text": "58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1949, "end": 1953, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1958, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1963, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We have been able to characterize a diverse range of clinical complications among the included patients, including a higher risk for death among the patients developing ARDS, which was more frequent in patients who had started antimalarials prior to hospitalization, similar to previously described cases [12, 62] .

The WHO severe malaria criteria were initially developed to identify individuals with P. falciparum infection at higher risk of death [63] , and there have been discussions among experts on the need to define specific severity criteria to be applied for P. vivax infection. Our study demonstrates that the application of the WHO criteria can reliably identify the patients at higher risk of complications, who therefore require more urgent and intensive care, which further agrees with previous pediatric data from the same research group [15] . A comprehensive analysis of the array of complications observed among the patients in our study and in the published literature provides reassurance of these findings by demonstrating that the spectrum of clinical manifestations is broadly covered by these definitions [12, 25] , with unusual manifestations being rarely reported. However, it seems important to highlight that severity derived from the use of primaquine among G6PD-deficient individuals, or splenic rupture, two well-known complications mostly seen in vivax infections [58, 64] , are not included in the current WHO definitions and should be carefully considered by clinicians working in vivax endemic areas. Furthermore, one must consider that in primary and community healthcare units, the characterization of the fulfillment of all WHO criteria is not possible due to the unavailability of laboratory facilities.

Among the clinical and laboratory markers, only total bilirubin presented a high discriminative performance to identify more than three criteria of severe disease, showing that although jaundice was justifiably excluded from the WHO severe malaria criteria, it still has an important prognostic value and should not be dismissed by health professionals in their initial assessment of P. vivaxinfected patients.

The unrepresentativeness of children at both sites probably reflects the fact that neither of the sites is a reference center for pediatric populations, albeit publications from both locations have previously described severe manifestation among P. vivax-infected children [15, 16] . The fact that the decisions to admit patients were made at the attending physician's discretion may have resulted in added selection bias, which we tried to minimize by applying the WHO severe malaria criteria and determining the occurrence of more than three criteria (as a surrogate for more severe disease). Note also that there are important differences in the health system organization as well as particular disparities in the management of cases, such as for example the systematic use of antibiotics upon admission in India. Ensuring that both sites followed the common protocol proved also to be challenging, and in some cases probably hinders some of the comparisons in this study, especially regarding the presence of comorbidities, such as malnutrition and other co-infections.
