It is well known that there is no threshold for spreading models on scale-free networks; this suggests that spread can occur on such networks, regardless of how low the contact rate may be. In this paper, I consider six models with different contact and propagation mechanisms, which include models studied so far, but are apt to be confused. To compare these six models, I analyze them by degree-based mean-field theory. I find that the result depends on the details of contact and propagation mechanism.",

Since the purpose of this paper is to compare the six models in terms of the function of the hubs, this approximation is enough to explain the difference among them. In this paper, I consider the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model as one of the simplest models for spreading phenomena. The SIS model is a model in epidemiology and is also known as the contact process model 6 . In an SIS model, a population with N individuals is categorize into two compartments: susceptible (S) and infected (I). The disease is transmitted only when a susceptible individual is in contact with an infected individual. When the case of information spreading is considered, S represents ignorant individuals and and I represents spreaders. The rate parameter \u03bb is the average number per time unit of close enough contacts such that transmission can occur. By rescaling time, the recovery rate can be set to 1 without the loss of generality. In the case of a fully mixed population, the model is represented by two stochastic events: 2. At the rate of 1, the recovery event is performed. Choose an individual at random. If the individual is infected, it recovers and becomes susceptible.",

I assume that an individual is located at each node of a fixed network. The links of the network represent potential connections. It is assumed that an individual is activated at each time step. Then, the active individual can contact its nearest neighbors on the network. Two types of contacting mechanism are considered: (1) all neighbors or (2) only one neighbor is contacted at the same time. In addition, two possibilities for transmission are considered: an active individual is (a) the sender or (b) the receiver. I also consider the hybrid case (c): an active individual plays both roles. By combining the contacting and transmitting types, six models are constructed, as shown as follows (see also Fig. 1 and Table 1 ).",

In the first class, an active individual can contact all of its neighbors at the same time. Here, the outbreak threshold can vanish, regardless of the direction of propagation. In the case where active individuals are senders (Model 1a), the epidemic prevalence is larger than in the case where they are receivers (Model 1b). This is due to the fact that in Model 1b, propagation from more than one infected neighbors comes to nothing. In the second class, an active individual can contact only one neighbor. In contrast to the first class, when the active individuals are receivers (Model 2b), the epidemic prevalence is larger than that for Model 2a. This result may look counterintuitive at first sight; however, this result is not so surprising, because for Model 2b, an infected hub can transmit disease to more than one individual during a time step, in contrast to Model 2a. It is more surprising that in the case where the transmission is bidirectional (Model 2c), the outbreak threshold can vanish, while in the case the transmission is one way (Models 2a and 2b) , the threshold remains finite. Thus, in the second class, the bidirectional transmission causes a qualitatively different effect. The intuitive explanation is that in Model 2c, a hub can play double role: a strong sender and strong receiver, as in models of the first class. However, it is emphasized that these are different types of phase transitions: \u03bb \u223c In conclusion, the spreading phenomena depend entirely on the detailed mechanisms of contact and propagation. Thus, it is a matter there are more than a few works where it is not clear what mechanism is adapted. As the six models handle extreme situations, more complicated models have to considered to reproduce the practical situations. However, the result of this paper has a wide-range of applications in the study of the spreading phenomena, not only for epidemic diseases but also for such things as rumors and information. For example, in the case that an active individual receives information from one neighbor and sends it to another neighbor, rather than all neighbors, Model 2c indicates that the information can survive even if the transmission rate is very low. In real world networks, the links can be rewired adaptively depending on the state of their nodes. This paper is also expected to be a reference point when considering such adaptive networks.",
