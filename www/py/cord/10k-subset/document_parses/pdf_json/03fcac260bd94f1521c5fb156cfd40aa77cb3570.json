Enteroviruses are genetically highly variable, and recombination between serotypes is known to be a major contribution to their diversity. Recently it was reported that recombination events in HRVs cause the diversity of HRV-C. This study analyzed parts of the viral genes spanning the 5\u2032 non-coding region (NCR) through to the viral protein (VP) encoding sequences of 105 HRV field isolates from 51 outpatient cases of Acute Respiratory Infectious Network (ARINET) and 54 inpatient cases of severe lower respiratory infection (SLRI) surveillance, in order to identify recombination in field samples. When analyzing parts of the 5\u2032NCR and VP4/VP2 encoding sequences, we found intra-and interspecies recombinants in field strains of HRV-A and -C. Nineteen cases of recombination events (18.1%) were found among 105 field strains. For HRV-A, there were five cases (4.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and three cases (2.8%) of interspecies recombination events. For HRV-C, there were four cases (3.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and seven cases (6.7%) of interspecies recombination events. Recombination events were significantly more frequently observed in the ARINET samples (18 cases) than in the SLRI samples (1 case; P< 0.0001). The recombination breakpoints were located in nucleotides (nt) 472-554, which comprise stem-loop 5 in the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), based on the HRV-B 35 sequence (accession no. FJ445187). Our findings regarding genomic recombination in circulating HRV-A and -C strains suggest that recombination might play a role in HRV fitness and could be a possible determinant of disease severity caused by various HRV infections in patients with ARI.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), first discovered in 1953, are nonenveloped, positive single-strand RNA viruses of the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae [1, 2] .

Surprisingly, we also detected three cases (2.8%) of interspecies recombination in HRV-A and four cases (3.8%) of intraspecies recombination in HRV-C viruses. The incidence of recombination events was found to be similarly distributed in both HRV-C (11/48 cases) and HRV-A (8/52 cases) strains (P>0.05) by testing for any difference between the two proportions [39] . We also confirmed that interspecies recombination events had occurred in 14 reference strains of HRV-C reference strains: QPM, QCE, NAT001, NY-074, C 24, C 25, C 26, N36, N46, C-43 p1154, CL170085, LZ269, LZY79 and LZY101. Interestingly, KA08-3539 and KA08-4189 have the same nucleotides in the 5\u2032NCR regions which clustered with the C isolate LZ508, but have the different VP4/VP2 sequences. Thus, KA08-3539 (interspecies recombination in HRV-A) and KA08-4189 (intraspecies recombination in HRV-C) were related to HRV-A 42 and to the C isolate LZY101, respectively. KA08-4374 (interspecies recombination in HRV-A) and KA09-756 (intraspecies recombination in HRV-C) also had the same 5\u2032 NCR and differences in the VP4/VP2 sequences. We assume that recombination events in the 5\u2032NCR between VP4 and VP2 could have led to this diversity of HRVs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 277, "end": 281, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 290, "end": 293, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 316, "end": 333, "text": "Lee et al.
