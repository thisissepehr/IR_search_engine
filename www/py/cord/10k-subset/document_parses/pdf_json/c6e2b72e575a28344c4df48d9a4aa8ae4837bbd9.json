One such factor is APOBEC3G. To overcome APOBEC3Gmediated restriction, many lentiviruses encode Vif, a protein that targets APOBEC3G for degradation. As with many restriction factor genes, primate APOBEC3G displays strong signatures of positive selection. This is interpreted as evidence that the primate APOBEC3G locus reflects a long-term evolutionary ''arms-race'' between retroviruses and their primate hosts. Here, we provide direct evidence that APOBEC3G has functioned as a barrier to cross-species transmission, selecting for viral resistance during emergence of the AIDS-causing pathogen SIVmac in captive colonies of Asian macaques in the 1970s. Specifically, we found that rhesus macaques have multiple, functionally distinct APOBEC3G alleles, and that emergence of SIVmac and simian AIDS required adaptation of the virus to evade APOBEC3G-mediated restriction. Our evidence includes the first comparative analysis of APOBEC3G polymorphism and function in both a reservoir and recipient host species (sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques, respectively), and identification of adaptations unique to Vif proteins of the SIVmac lineage that specifically antagonize rhesus APOBEC3G alleles. By demonstrating that interspecies variation in a known restriction factor selected for viral counter-adaptations in the context of a documented case of cross-species transmission, our results lend strong support to the evolutionary ''arms-race'' hypothesis. Importantly, our study confirms that APOBEC3G divergence can be a critical determinant of interspecies transmission and emergence of primate lentiviruses, including viruses with the potential to infect and spread in human populations.

Well-documented examples include the emergence of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 in humans in the midto-late 20 th century, and emergence of pathogenic SIVmac in captive Asian macaques in the 1970s [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] . The exact time and circumstances under which SIVsm initially jumped from sooty mangabeys into rhesus macaques to give rise to SIVmac are unknown, but it is very likely that transmission may have resulted from experimental interventions involving the transfusion of material from one species into another [9] . Despite the extraordinary attention the primate lentiviruses have since received from the AIDS research community, very little is known about the impact of host genetic variation on the transmission of these viruses between different primate species, or the degree to which successful emergence of lentiviral pathogens requires adaptation to overcome genetic divergence between reservoir species and newly emergent hosts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 168, "end": 170, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 329, "end": 332, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 333, "end": 335, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 530, "end": 532, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 533, "end": 535, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 536, "end": 538, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 539, "end": 541, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 542, "end": 544, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 851, "end": 854, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Cellular restriction factors are host factors that render the host cell resistant to viral infection (also referred to as intrinsic immunity) [10, 11] . For many restriction factor genes, the rate of fixation of nonsynonymous changes often exceeds that expected by genetic drift alone, consistent with evolution under strong positive selection, and it is generally assumed that viral pathogens are the source of selective pressure driving evolution of such genes [12, 13, 14] . As a consequence of positive selection, even phylogenetically similar species are likely to differ in terms of restriction factor functionality. Thus, interspecies differences in restriction factor loci could serve as genetic barriers to cross-species transmission and emergence of viruses. One way to test this hypothesis is to focus on known transmission events and ask whether specific restrictions played a role. Viruses that successfully overcome species-level barriers imposed by restriction should harbor adaptive changes (relative to viruses in the established host) that confer resistance to restriction in the new host. Thus, identification of changes which correlate with host-switching events, and which demonstrably overcome restriction(s) imposed by the new host, constitute direct evidence that a specific host restriction factor can act as determinant of cross-species transmission and emergence of viral pathogens. For example, we previously reported that the host restriction factor TRIM5 can suppress viral replication in vivo, exerting selective pressure during the initial stages of cross-species transmission [15] . More specifically, we demonstrated that allelic variation in TRIM5 influences the outcome of SIVsm infection in rhesus macaques, and that emergence of SIVsm (as pathogenic SIVmac) required adaptations to overcome the genetic barrier imposed by the most common variant of rhesus macaque TRIM5.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 146, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 147, "end": 150, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 468, "end": 471, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 472, "end": 475, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1613, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The cellular restriction factor APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G) inhibits retroviruses by incorporating into budding virions and inducing hypermutation of the viral cDNA during reverse transcription [16, 17, 18] .

We found that the A3G coding sequences of sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques have several fixed, nonsynonymous differences. Moreover, we found that rhesus A3G (rhA3G) has an unusual polymorphism in the Nterminal domain, in which a highly conserved tyrosine is replaced by a two-amino acid insertion (either Y 59 /LR [59] [60] or Y 59 /LL [59] [60] .

Furthermore, we identified a single 17 Gly-to- 17 Glu adaptation common to the Vif proteins of multiple SIVmac isolates that confers the ability to degrade rhA3G LR and rhA3G LL . This same adaptation occurred at least twice, once during emergence of SIVmac, and again during intentional adaptation of SIVsm to rhesus macaques by experimental passage in vivo (SIVsmE543) [30] .

We identified seven nonsynonymous singlenucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in rhesus macaque A3G (rhA3G) and four nsSNPs in sooty mangabey A3G (smA3G) ( Figure 1A , see also Figure S1 ). Changes were only chosen when they were detected in at least three independent clones. With one exception (144D/G), the nsSNPs clustered either in the first active domain or the second pseudoactive domain of A3G. In addition to single amino-acid substitutions (59Y/L, 73Q/H/R, 77E/K, 144D/G, 353C/R and 356 C/R), rhesus macaques also have an insertion at position 60 (L or R). The four substitutions in sooty mangabeys included two in the first active domain (76L/R and 111K/E) and two in the second pseudoactive domain (370D/A and 376R/Q). It is notable that polymorphisms in both species are clustered in the same two regions of the protein, and that almost all substitutions in both regions resulted in a difference in charge Author Summary APOBEC3G is a host factor that can inhibit replication of primate lentiviruses, including HIV-1, HIV-2, and the related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) of African primates. As a consequence, primate lentiviruses encode a protein, called Vif, which can induce degradation of APOBEC3G. Given its antiviral role, APOBEC3G may be an important genetic barrier to interspecies jumping of primate lentiviruses. To study this possibility, we asked whether APOBEC3G affected transmission of SIV from sooty mangabeys (SIVsm) to rhesus macaques and subsequent emergence of pathogenic SIVmac in the 1970s. We found that APOBEC3G of sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques have divergent protein sequences, and that the Vif proteins of SIVsm (Vif-SIVsm) cannot counteract rhesus macaque APOBEC3G. We mapped Vif-SIVsm resistance to a specific substitution in the N-terminal domain of rhesus APOBEC3G, in which a highly conserved tyrosine is replaced by leucine-arginine (YRLR). We also identified a viral counter-adaptation, found in the Vif proteins of all SIVmac strains, which specifically confers the ability to antagonize APOBEC3G of rhesus macaques. This change was most likely selected during adaptation of SIV to its new host. Together, these results demonstrate that APOBEC3G can serve as a critical genetic determinant of interspecies transmission of primate immunodeficiency viruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 420, "end": 429, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 441, "end": 450, "text": "Figure S1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Allelic variation in rhesus macaque and sooty mangabey A3G"}, {"text": "(either a charge switch or gain/loss of a charge). It is striking that polymorphism at some of these sites occur in multiple species; for example, one of the polymorphic sites found in rhesus macaque (residue 77) and one found in sooty mangabey (residue 110) are both polymorphic in African green monkeys [31] . Similarly, position 130 is polymorphic in both rhesus macaques (either asparagine or aspartic acid) and African green monkeys (either aspartic acid or histidine) [32] . The clustering of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the first active domain, including polymorphisms at sites that are polymorphic in more than one species, is Figure 1 . Rhesus macaque and sooty mangabey A3G coding sequences are highly polymorphic and differ in sensitivity to Vifmediated degradation.

Of the six different rhA3G alleles tested, only one (allele rh6) was clearly sensitive to degradation by Vif-SIVsmE041, although one other allele (rh2) was weakly sensitive to degradation in the presence of Vif-SIVsmE041. In contrast, all six rhesus macaque alleles (rh1-rh6) were clearly degraded by Vif-SIVmac239. Both Vif-SIVsmE041 and Vif-SIVmac239 induced degradation of all six sooty mangabey A3G alleles ( Figure 1B and Figure S3 ). LR 59-60 renders A3G resistant to Vif-SIVsmE041 induced degradation and is unique to macaques All of the rhesus A3G alleles that resist Vif-SIVsmE041mediated degradation have a Tyr-to-Leu substitution at position 59, followed by either an Arg insertion (alleles rh1, rh3, rh4, and rh5), or a Leu insertion (allele rh2). In contrast, the rh6 allele and all six of the sooty mangabey alleles retain a highly conserved Tyr at position 59, and lack any additional insertions. Importantly, the Y/LR and Y/LL substitutions are the only differences that distinguish all of the Vif-SIVsmE041-resistant A3G proteins from all of the sensitive alleles, leading us to hypothesize that these substitution are responsible for the observed differences in sensitivity to degradation by Vif-SIVsmE041. To test this hypothesis, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change one of the resistant alleles (rh1) at position 59/60, either substituting the Arg for an Leu (LR R LL) or removing the insertion and reverting position 59 to the ancestral/conserved Tyr (LR R Y).

Because there are multiple differences in the N-terminal regions of the Vif-SIVsmE041 and Vif-SIVmac239 proteins, we first constructed a chimeric Vif protein in which the N-terminal 56 residues of Vif-SIVsmE041 were replaced with the homologous portion of Vif-SIVmac239 ( Figure 3A ). As with Vif-SIVmac239, expression of the chimeric Vif protein was also able to induce degradation of all three rhA3G alleles ( Figure 3B ), indicating that adaptative changes to overcome rhA3G-mediated restriction might be found within the first 56 amino acids of the Vif protein.

Discussion New viral pathogens arise when viruses succeed in jumping from natural reservoirs into new host populations, resulting in emerging infectious diseases such as AIDS, SARS and pandemic influenza [6, 44, 45, 46] . The importance of ecological factors in viral emergence is well documented, whereas the significance of host genetic differences as barriers to emergence is still not clear [47] . In particular, it is believed that cellular antiviral restriction factors can act as blockades to cross-species transmission and viral emergence, yet very few studies have examined this possibility in vivo. The emergence of SIVmac and outbreaks of simian AIDS in outbred colonies of macaques in the 1970s provides an unusual opportunity to examine the impact of specific, host-encoded restriction factors in the context of an emerging pathogen. Focusing on SIVsm and SIVmac has multiple advantages for understanding the genetics of lentiviral emergence: both the natural reservoir host and the emergent new host are known (sooty mangabeys and rhesus macaques, respectively); archived samples and cloned, primary viral isolates are readily available; and most importantly, several key host-encoded restriction factors that target primate lentiviruses are known and have been well-characterized at the molecular level [48, 49, 50, 51] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1201, "end": 1204, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1208, "text": "44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1212, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1216, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1396, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2319, "text": "[48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2320, "end": 2323, "text": "49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2324, "end": 2327, "text": "50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2328, "end": 2331, "text": "51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 169, "text": "Figure 5B", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 624, "end": 633, "text": "Figure 1B", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 638, "end": 647, "text": "Figure 3B", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "The Vif-SIVmac239(E17G) mutation results in increased incorporation of rhA3G LR into virions and lower infectivity"}, {"text": "Cellular restriction factors that target replication of primate lentiviruses include A3G [17] , TRIM5a [52] , BST2/Tetherin [53, 54, 55] and SAMHD1 [56, 57] .

The model suggests that Arg60 and Lys128 are probably located on the same face of A3G, within approximately 20 \u00c5 of each other. Because variation at both sites affects Vif-mediated degradation, the simplest explanation is that residues 60 and 128 are part of a single Vif-binding surface on A3G (this does not exclude the possibility that different Vif homologs have evolved to make different contacts with the same surface).

As with A3G and SIVmac239, the impact of rhesus TRIM5 on replication of established SIVmac isolates is minimal [63, 68] . Thus, our data and previously published studies of both A3G and TRIM5 in macaques support the hypothesis that restriction has its greatest biological impact as a modulator of interspecies transmission and emergence of viral pathogens. Evidence of positive selection in primate restriction factor loci may therefore reflect recurrent or continuous lineage-specific exposures to viruses of other species, with repeated transmission events and outbreaks of disease driving fixation of resistance alleles. This could occur in situations where different host populations come into physical contact -for example, as the result of fighting over territory or when one species routinely preys on another. Whether restriction factors continue to play a role after a pathogen becomes established in the new host is not as clear, and will require further study.
