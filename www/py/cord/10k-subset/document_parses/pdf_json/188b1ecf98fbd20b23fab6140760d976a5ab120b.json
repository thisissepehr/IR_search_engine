Preventing future allergic reactions in patients who have already developed a systemic reaction is based on the correct management of the acute phase of the reaction followed by a correct diagnosis and, where indicated, prescription of adrenaline autoinjectors and VIT. A possible strategy to optimize care processes and to improve outcomes is the implementation of a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Care Pathways, also known as Integrated Care Pathways or Clinical Pathways (CPWs). The aim of the care pathway is to enhance the quality of care by improving risk-adjusted patient outcomes, promoting patient safety, increasing patient satisfaction, and optimizing the use of resources. To our knowledge, currently in Italy as well as in Europe, there is no CPWs codified for the management of HVA patients. This paper describes the development of the clinical content of a care pathway for the management of HVA.",

            "text": "Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) is an underestimated condition representing an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It can occur with varying degrees of severity (from local to anaphylactic reactions) and can sometimes be fatal. According to the data from the European Anaphylaxis Registry, HVA is the first Bil\u00f2 et al. Clin Transl Allergy (2020) 10:8 cause of severe reactions in adults and the second in children (48.2% and 20.2% respectively) [1] . In different countries, HVA is responsible for about 20% of the total cases of fatal anaphylaxis [2] . Overall, the incidence of mortality in the various European countries is between 0.03/million/year in Italy and 0.48 in France. However, mortality data are generally underestimated, as deaths are likely to be attributed by mistake to other causes, in particular to cardiac disorders. Moreover, up to 8% of adult patients with HVA may simultaneously suffer from a systemic mastocytosis (SM). SM is a clonal mast cell (MC) disease that can lead to potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions caused by excessive MC mediator release. Anaphylaxis is the most severe clinical manifestation of SM and is characterized by hypotension and syncope in the absence of urticarial and angioedema [3] .",

Skin tests are the gold standard for diagnosis and should be carried out at least 2 weeks after the last sting, to exclude a false negative response during the refractory period. The presence of serum specific IgE to Hymenoptera venoms can be detected immediately after sting, even if the best period for their determination is 1-4 weeks after the sting. Diagnosis could be complicated by sensitization to multiple venoms (Apis mellifera/vespids or Vespula spp./Polistes dominula) in patients who have not identified the stinging Hymenoptera. The availability on the market of some major allergens expressed in recombinant form allows evaluating the specific IgE to individual molecular markers (CRD, Component-Resolved-Diagnosis). CRD may discriminate between primary sensitization and crossreactivity in patients with double and multiple positivity of diagnostic tests with whole extracts [5] .",

The reading should be performed after 15-20 min; the positivity is documented by an increase of at least 3 mm of the average diameter of the initial wheal, with associated erythema. To allow comparison of results, a morphological score should be used, which consists in drawing, on transparent cellophane, the area injected and the area of the reaction after 15-20 min of time Perform intradermal test administering 0.02 mL of the allergenic extract, collecting the result after 15-20 min. To allow the comparison of the results, use a morphological score consisting in drawing on a transparent tape the injected area and the reaction area after 15-20 min The panel of Italian experts, considering that available data are insufficient, recommends a preliminary step where the same concentration of more venoms is simultaneously used for skin testing. Only after reading the reactions to this first set, a higher concentration should be used. This caution is to be maintained specially in patients with severe anaphylactic reaction or suffering from mast cells disorders Perform simultaneously the same concentration of different venoms and hereafter the following concentration I13 D11 [20] Do not rely on the degree of sensitivity on skin or in vitro testing because it does not reliably predict the severity of a sting reaction Do not use skin or serological reactivity to predict the reaction severity following the sting If initial test results are negative in a patient with a clear history of systemic sting reaction, further testing (in vitro testing, repeat skin testing, or both) should be performed, as well as basal serum tryptase measurement Perform additional tests (in vitro tests, skin tests repetition, or both, and basal serum Tryptase level) in patients with a clear history of a systemic reaction after a sting and negative skin tests I13 D13 [22] If the allergic reaction in mastocytosis patients occurred many years before, the negativity of test could depend from this physiologic decrease and it could be useful to repeat further tests in order to detect a possible sensitization If the allergic reaction in mastocytosis patients occurred many years before, repeat allergy tests when negative and perform second and third level diagnostic tests IgE to CCD can explain multiple in vitro positive results; serum determination for CCD (bromelain or MUXF3) allows greater diagnostic accuracy Detect serum IgE to CCD (bromelin or MUXF3) in case of multiple in vitro positive results I13 D15 [28] Api m 1, the most relevant allergen of bee venom, is not sensitizing in up to 43% of cases.

A REMA score of at least 2 predicts with a high sensitivity and specificity for ISMs-(or c-MCAS), whereas a REMA score of less than 2 usually indicates non-clonal disease. The REMA score is a particularly helpful tool since it is based on clinical data and can be used on a routine clinical basis, it is associated with rather low costs, and it avoids unnecessary BM studies Use REMA score to predict a clonal mast cell disease before submitting the patients to bone marrow biopsy Subjects with anaphylaxis after wasp or bee stings and negative allergy test results might have unrecognized mastocytosis. In these subjects, investigations for major and minor SM criteria are recommended, regardless of Serum baseline tryptase (sBT) level or the presence of skin lesionsPerform an accurate hematologic workup to detect major and minor criteria of systemic mastocytosis in patients with Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis and negative diagnostic tests In cases with a clearly raised SBT level (> 25 ng/mL), BM biopsy is usually recommended, whereas in patients with systemic HVA reactions and borderline or normal tryptase, the scoring system proposed by REMA (score) can be useful to decide whether patients should undergo BM biopsy Perform a bone marrow biopsy in case of clearly raised serum basal tryptase (> 25 ng/mL). In patients with systemic Hymenoptera venom reaction and borderline or normal serum basal tryptase level, use REMA score to decide whether patients should undergo bone marrow biopsy In the presence of a very low BM MC burden, KIT D816V mutation analysis should be performed with very sensitive techniques, such as quantitative RT-PCR Diagnose systemic mastocytosis performing KIT D816VT mutation analysis with a very sensitive technique, such as RT-PCR, in the presence of a very low bone marrow mast cell burden (major criterion) Assessment of sBT levels is an inexpensive, reliable, and simple screening test for mastocytosis in subjects with a positive history of a systemic reaction to hymenoptera stings Determine basal serum tryptase level in all the patients with positive history of hymenoptera sting systemic reaction I13, I15, I17 M6 [26] In the follow-up and monitoring of patients with mastocytosis s-tryptase is a widely used marker of MC burden Use serum basal tryptase levels as a marker of mast cells burden to follow-up patients with mastocytosis In these patients, it is very important to use a highly sensitive multiparameter flow cytometry approach to stain BM cells, using a combination of five monoclonal antibodies-CD45, CD117, CD34, CD25, and CD2-and with at least 1 to 3 million events acquired to detect atypical MC in these patients who have a very low MC burden In patients with systemic mastocytosis, use a highly sensitive multiparameter flow cytometry with a combination of five monoclonal antibodies (CD45, CD117, CD34, CD25 e CD2) It is important to confirm the diagnosis of c-MCAS in patients with HVA: (i) before to decide to stop VIT because, in patients with a diagnosis of c-MCAS, VIT must be continued lifelong. (ii) in order to give them a proper advice on the use of adrenaline. (iii) to investigate and manage other manifestations of c-MCAS, such as osteoporosis Confirm the diagnosis of c-MCAS in Hymenoptera venom allergic patients to decide VIT duration, adrenaline autoinjector prescription as well as the evaluation of other clinical manifestation associated to systemic mastocy-Of note, s-tryptase is not disease-specific for mastocytosis and may be elevated in healthy individuals, and in other conditions, such as chronic urticaria, kidney failure, chronic helminth infections, or other myeloid haematological diseases A similar, step-wise approach, including KIT D816V testing in the algorithm is recommended by the ECNM (European Competence Network on Mastocytosis) Diagnose systemic mastocytosis with other tests in addition to basal serum tryptase among which KIT D816VT mutation analysis In general, these centres recommend and perform a thorough BM examination in order to exclude or to establish the diagnosis of SM, to assess the BM MC burden, and to rule out or demonstrate the presence of another (associated) hematological disease Perform a thorough bone marrow biopsy to exclude or confirm the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis, to evaluate the mast cells burden, and to exclude or detect another hematological associated disease The diagnosis of SM is made upon the presence of the major criterion (histological finding of at least 15 multifocal dense MC infiltrates in BM or other extracutaneous organs) plus 1 minor criterion, or at least 3 out of 4 minor criteria (abnormal morphology of extracutaneous MC; serum tryptase > 20 ng/m; expression of CD2 and/or CD25 on BM MC; detection of a mutation at codon 816 of the KIT gene in extracutaneous organs). Clinical features associated with MC burden (B findings) or aggressiveness of disease (C findings) are also applied to subclassify patients with SM Diagnose systemic mastocytosis upon the presence of a major plus a minor criterion, or at least three minor criteria. Subclassify systemic mastocytosis in indolent, smoldering or aggressive on the basis of the presence of B and/or MCAS can be diagnosed when patients have recurrent systemic, usually severe, symptoms of MC activation, and involvement of MC can be documented preferably by demonstrating a transient increase of serum tryptase or another established MC mediator during (or shortly after) an event; moreover, symptoms need to respond to anti-mediator-type or MC-stabilizing medications. All these criteria should be fulfilled in order to confirm the diagnosis of MCAS To confirm the MCAS diagnosis, all the established criteria need to be satisfied: recurrent systemic symptoms responsive to anti-mediator therapy or to mast cell stabilizing medications, transient increase of serum tryptase or another established mast cell mediator during an event I15, I16, I17 M13 [26] In children the diagnosis of CM is largely clinical and a BM examination is not warranted or recommended except for the very rare situation where the child does not thrive and, in addition, shows persistently high and rising s-tryptase levels, abnormal blood count, or hepato/splenomegaly Diagnose cutaneous mastocytosis in the children by clinical examination; bone marrow biopsy is not warrant nor recommended except for very rare situations. In all adult patients and all childhood patients, a precise and complete physical examination is standard When suspect systemic mastocytosis carry out a complete physical examination in all the patients, both children and adults I12, I15, I17 M15 [26] Elevated baseline serum tryptase is characteristically found in SM, although a normal serum tryptase level does not rule out the presence of mastocytosis Do not exclude the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis on the basis of normal basal serum tryptase levels The characteristics of severe HVA episodes with hypotension in the absence of urticaria/angioedema might represent the most relevant factor to identify those patients with HVA and CMDs, regardless of baseline tryptase levels. In such patients, who are indeed very rare, a proper and adequate diagnosis should be offered without delay Perform an accurate diagnostic workup for mastocytosis in patients with a history of severe anaphylaxis and absence of urticaria/angioedema; furthermore do not exclude systemic mastocytosis on the basis of normal basal serum tryptase levels",
