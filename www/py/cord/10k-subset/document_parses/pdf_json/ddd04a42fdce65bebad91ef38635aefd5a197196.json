HFRS has become a serious public health problem in China. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of HFRS has not been completely clarified. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and to further explore its potential roles in HFRS. The levels of serum DcR3 were measured by sandwich ELISA. We found serum DcR3 levels increased significantly, which reached peak value during the oliguric phase and in the critical group. Moreover, serum DcR3 levels were closely related to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and parameters reflecting kidney injury including BUN, creatinine (Cr) and proteinuria. This study indicates that high levels of serum DcR3 have associations with the disease stages, severity and degree of kidney damage. Meanwhile, our results suggest that DcR3 may play a dual role in HFRS pathogenesis. First, DcR3 is involved in the inflammatory cascade response resulting in capillary permeability and kidney injury in the early stage. Secondly, HTNV infection induced DcR3 expression at the convalescent phase may act as a feed-back mechanism in anti-inflammatory response. Thus, a study of DcR3 is essential for a better understanding of HFRS pathogenesis.",

The data show that serum DcR3 levels increase initially from the febrile phase, reach peak value during the oliguric phase, and then decrease gradually up to the convalescent phase in four different severity groups. Moreover, the levels of serum DcR3 in patients with HFRS change from low to high following an order from mild group, moderate group, severe group to critical group during five phases. These findings suggest that the dynamic changes of serum DcR3 levels in HFRS are associated with the disease stage and severity. Most notably, elevated serum DcR3 levels were still found during the convalescent phase in four different severity groups, especially in the critical group. However, clinically, the disease is almost recovered at this phase. Evidence shows that FasL-induced murine pulmonary inflammation is reduced by the intravenous pretreatment of a DcR3 analog [24] , supporting a protective role of DcR3 in inflammation process. Hence, during the convalescent phase, DcR3 may participate in improving the repair of serious capillary permeability and kidney injury. High DcR3 expression during the convalescent phase may act as a feed-back mechanism in an anti-inflammatory response. Moreover, in the critical group, more DcR3 is required to work. It is conceivable that the decline and disappearance of DcR3 from serum could be regarded as the timescale of the disease.",

Clinically, the course of HFRS is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to a lethal outcome. Moreover, there are overlaps among the different phases and groups, which cause difficulties to clinicians for correct staging and typing of HFRS [2] [3] [4] . This study indicates that DcR3 may be a biomarker for patients with HFRS. First, DcR3 is closely related to the disease stage, severity and kidney injury. Moreover, DcR3 levels can be measured in accessible specimen (peripheral blood samples) by commercially available ELISA kits. Therefore, they have potential clinical application, and may well complement subjective judgments in diagnosis. In our study, we also find that the variation tendencies of DcR3 are consistent with TNF-a at different phases in four groups. Moreover, DcR3 highly correlates with proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a, which may suggest that DcR3 is involved in the inflammatory cascade response in HFRS pathogenesis. Supporting this notion, DcR3 has been observed in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as ARDS with an infectious etiology, SLE and asthma [21, 23, 27] . Taking all these into consideration, we speculate that DcR3 may play important roles in the inflammatory and immune response in HFRS.",
