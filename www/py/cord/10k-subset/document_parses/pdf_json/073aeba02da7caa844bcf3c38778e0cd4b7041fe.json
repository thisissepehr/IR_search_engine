Further support for this taxonomic position came from recent reports of a possible antigenic relationship to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus of swine (5, lo) , which is an established member of the Coronaviridae family (6) . With the aim of obtaining more seroepidemiologic evidence, a heterologous indirect immunofluorescence assay was developed using TGE virus-infected porcine thyroid cells as antigen. The test has been applied to sera from different cat populations in the Netherlands with and without a FIP history and its results have been compared with those of a microneutralization test against TGE virus (9) . -4 cats before and after experimental inoculation with the Dahlberg strain of FIP virus (1, 2) and finally succumbing to the infection; 4 additional experimental animals where preserum was not available. Sera from two specified pathogen-free cats before and after FIP virus inoculation kindly provided by Dr. N. C. PEDERSEN, Davis 10 min., dried, and stored at this temperature until use. 20 pl. volumes of serial twofold dilutions of the sera and peritoneal fluids (starting at 1 : 10) were dropped onto the cells. The slides were incubated for 1 hr at 37 O C in a moist chamber and subsequently washed three times with PBS and once with distilled water. After air drying, 2Opl. volumes of a diluted FITC labelled rabbit anti-feline IgG immunoglobulin preparation were applied to the wells, the slides were incubated, washed and dried as before and mounted in Uvak (Searle, High Wycombe Bucks.

Using an indirect homologous immunofluorescence test, PEDERSEN was able to show that only macrophage-like cells seem to support FIP virus multiplication (3). With cryostat sections from organs of experimentally infected cats serving as antigen, he performed serologic studies in order to determine the frequency and titers of antibody in several cat populations (4) . A different approach was chosen by others, who tried to detect serologic relationships between FIP virus and other coronaviruses. High titers of neutralizing antibody against TGE virus were reported to be present in the sera and peritoneal fluids of FIP field cases (5, 10). Using a FITC-conjugated immunoglobulin preparation from exudates of a leopard suffering from FIP, viral antigen was demonstrated in TGE vius infected porcine cells; on the other hand FIP antigen could not be detected in cat organs using labelled porcine anti-TGE immunglobulin, which has been interpreted in terms of a one-way antigenic relationship existing between the two viruses (10) . With the aim of adapting the immunofluorescence technique for large scale seroepidemiologic screening we developed an indirect heterologous test; dried and acetone-fixed pig thyroid cell suspensions on microscope slides containing a known proportion of TGE infected to uninfected cells were used as antigen. As compiled in Table 2 , our results compare with those obtained in a homologous FIP immunofluorescence assay (4). In field and experimental FIP cases serum antibodies are consistently found and about 90 O / o of the animals in FIP problem catteries were seropositive; in the open \"natural\" population, one cat out of five (4) or six (present report) has evidence of fluorescent antibody. In two out of the five available peritoneal fluids from experimentally infected cats, no antibody was found; one animal (number 11, Tab. 1) had died 5 days postinoculation, where antibodies probably had not enough time to develop; another cat (number VIII) suffering from a rapidly debilitating infection may have shown the preterminal decrease in antibody titer described (4) . Since in our heterologous test the antibody titers are about 10-fold lower than in the homologous reaction, these cases may escape detection by serology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 504, "end": 507, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1172, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2248, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1498, "end": 1505, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Based on our results with experimentally infected cats from our own as well as from the Davis laboratory and on the figures obtained from cat populations with differing FIP histories we think that the antibodies measured by indirect TGE virus immunofluorescence are a reflection of an infection wich FIP virus rather than with another coronavirus. The possibility that TGE virus itself is responsible for seroconversion can be excluded since we found 57, no neutralizing activity in the IFT-positive sera and ascitic fluids. This is in contrast to earlier reports (see Table 2 ) and may indicate the existence of FIP virus serotypes which are more or less closely related to TGE virus.
