We found a sharp elevation of excess mortality rates among school-aged groups at the time of the pandemic, with a consistent signature even in countries mildly affected by the pandemic overall. The impact on school-aged children was particularly pronounced in the first year of influenza A(H2N2) virus circulation, while the impact on older adults was stronger in subsequent years-a pattern reminiscent of the 1918 and 2009 pandemic [17] [18] [19] . Excess mortality rates were lowest in school-aged children and increased monotonously at older ages, in line with agespecific excess mortality rates reported in the United States [7, 16] and consistent with a lack of protection of the elderly population from excess mortality (termed \"senior sparing\"). A seroepidemiology study has reported prepandemic protective antibodies to A/H2 in Dutch persons older than approximately 70 years [20] and is not necessarily contradictory to our data, as it would have been nearly impossible to detect a sparing effect, given the small population size of these age groups and the resolution of our data set. It is generally accepted that senior sparing did not play a major role in the 1957 pandemic, in contrast to the 1918, 1968, and 2009 pandemics, when seniors were partially protected due to prior childhood exposure to antigenically related viruses [3, 17, [21] [22] [23] [24] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 95, "end": 98, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 99, "end": 102, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 599, "end": 603, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 604, "end": 608, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 609, "end": 613, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 795, "end": 798, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 799, "end": 802, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1511, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1515, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1520, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1525, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1530, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1535, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our study fills a gap in the availability of global mortality estimates for historical influenza pandemics, which can help guide pandemic planning.

Overall, our study reinforces substantial geographic variation in the pandemic-related mortality burden between countries, much of which remains unexplained, thus echoing recent work on the 1918 and 2009 pandemic [2, 3] . Such variations indicate that the proposed use of a pandemic severity index may be problematic unless it is based on multiple countries representative of a spectrum of health and economic development in several world regions. Further, our study suggests that it is critical to both consider the absolute and relative impact of a pandemic-by country and age groups-to fully understand severity patterns in various populations. In future pandemics, it will be critical to analyze severity statistics from a number of indicator countries, to generate more-accurate estimates of the global disease burden in near real time.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 476, "end": 479, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 575, "end": 578, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 795, "end": 798, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 799, "end": 801, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at http://jid.oxfordjournals.org.
