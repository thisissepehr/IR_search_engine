Patients with low MDA are prone to shock. Although the mortality from septic shock is not affected by the level of MDA, patients not in shock render a greater risk for unfavorable outcome when MDA is low. Patients with low MDA infected by species of K. pneumoniae were found to carry a greater risk for the pathogen to be resistant to carbapenems. Our data suggest that MDA can be considered an indirect index of the potential of neutrophils for the production of oxygen free radicals by the azurophil granules. Free radicals attack phospholipids of cell membranes and this leads to the production of MDA [9] . This index is decreased in septic shock and it is compatible with the exhaustion of the innate immune defense that takes place when septic shock develops [15] . The functional significance of the index is fully demonstrated among the non-shocked population. In that population, where shock does not exist as a driver for mortality, circulating MDA lower than 2.70 mM indicates the presence of neutrophil exhaustion and this can independently predispose to death. CI confidence interval, n number of observations, OR odds ratio As far as the predisposition to carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae is concerned, there are a couple of explanations. First of all, these patients have a low MDA, which implies an exhaustion of neutrophil function. This may lead to more acquisition of prevalent hospital pathogens. A more attractive explanation comes from the recent findings of our group. We have recently shown that isolates of K. pneumoniae which produce carbapenemase suppress T17 cells and subsequent production of interleukin (IL)-17 [16] . IL-17 is a major chemoattractant for neutrophils at the infection site.
