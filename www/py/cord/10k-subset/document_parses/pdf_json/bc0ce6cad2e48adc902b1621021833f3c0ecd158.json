            "text": "In order to assess the influence of total-body irradiation (TBI) on the outcome and incidence of complication after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we retrospectively analyzed our patients treated for acute leukemia and conditioned with TBI prior to BMT. Patients and Methods: Between 1980 and 1993, 326 patients referred to our department with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL, n = 182) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 144) in complete remission underwent TBI either in single dose (190 patients: 10 Gy administered to the midplane, and 8 Gy to the lungs [STBI]) or in 6 fractions (136 patients: 12 Gy on 3 consecutive days, and 9 Gy to the lungs [FTBI]) before BMT. The male-to-female ratio was 204/122 (1.67), and the median age was 30 years (mean: 30 _+ 11. range: 3 to 63). The patients were analyzed according to 3 instantaneous dose rate groups: 118 patients in the LOW group (< 0.048 Gy/min), 188 in the MEDIUM group (> 0.048 and _< 0.09 Gy/min), and 20 in the HIGH group (> 0.09 cGy/min). Conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) alone in 250 patients, CY and other drugs in 54, and 22 patients were conditioned using combinations without CY. Following TB1, allogeneic and autologous BMT were realized respectively in 118 and 208 patients. Median follow-up period was 68 months (mean: 67 + 29, range: 24 to 130 months). Results: Five-year survival, LFS, RI and TRM rates were 42%, 40%, 47%, and 24%, respectively. Five-year LFS was 36% in the STBI and 45% in the FTBI group (p = 0.17). It was 36% in the LOW group, 42% in the MEDI-UM group, and 30% in the HIGH group (p > 0.05). Five-year RI was 50% in STBI, 43% in FTBI, 55% in LOW, 41% in MEDIUM, and 44% in HIGH groups (STBI vs. FTBI, p = 0.48; LOW vs. MEDIUM, p = 0.03; MEDI-UM vs. HIGH, p = 0.68). TRM was not influenced significantly by the different TBI techniques. When analyzing separately the influence of fractionation and the instantaneous dose rate either in ANLL or ALL patients, no difference in terms of survival and LFS was observed. Fractionation did not influence the 5-year RI both in ANLL and ALL patients. However, among the patients with ANLL, 5-year RI was significantly higher (58%) in the LOW group than the MEDIUM group (31%, p = 0.001), whereas instantaneous dose rate did not significantly influence the RI in ALL patients. The 5-year TRM rate was significantly higher in allogeneic BMT group both in ANLL (37%) and ALL (37%) patients than those treated by autologous BMT (ANLL: 15%, ALL: 18%: p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively). The 5-year estimated interstitial pneumonitis (IP) and cataract incidence rates were 22% and 19%, respectively, in all patients. IP incidence seemed to be higher in the HIGH group (46%) than the MEDIUM (19%, p = 0.05) or LOW (25%, p = 0.15) groups. Furthermore, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by fractionation (STBI vs. FTBI, 29% vs. 9%; p = 0.003) and instantaneous dose rate (LOW vs. MEDIUM vs. HIGH, 0% vs. 27% vs. 33%; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the best factors influencing the survival were 1st CR (p = 0.0007), age _< 40 years (p = 0.003), and BMT after 1985 (p = 92 Strahlenther. Onkol. 174;1998:92-104 (Nr. 2) BelkacOmi et al.: Total-Body Irradiation prior to Bone Marrow Transplantation for Acute Leukemia 0.008). The RI was influenced independently only by the remission status (p = 0.0002). On the other hand, the TRM rate was lower in patients who did not experience graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD, p < 0.0001), and in those treated after 1985 (p = 0.0005). GvHD was the only independent factor involved in the development of IP (p = 0.01). When considering the cataract incidence, the only independent factor was the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.0008). Conclusion: The outcome of BMT patients conditioned with TBI for acute leukemia was not significantly influenced by the TBI technique, and TRM seemed to be lower in patients treated after 1985. On the other hand, cataract incidence was significantly influenced by the instantaneous dose rate. Key Words: TBI. Dose rate. Fractionation 9 Acute leukemia 9 BMT Ganzk6rperbestrahlung vor Knochenmarktransplantation bei akuter Leuk/imie in erster oder zweiter Vollremission: Ergebnisse und prognostische Faktoren bei 326 untersuchten Patienten Hintergrund: Um den Einfluf3 der Ganzk6rperbestrahlung (TBI) auf die Prognose und die Inzidenz von Komplikationen bei Knochenmarktransplantationen (BMT) zu evaluieren, haben wir retrospektiv unser Patientengut, das bei akuter Leukfimie vor der BMT mit der TBI behandelt wurde, analysiert. Pa/ienten und Methode: Von 1980 bis 1993 wurden 326 Patienten mit akuter nichtlymphatischer Leuk~imie (ANLL, n = 182) und akuter lymphatischer Leuk~imie (ALL, n = 144) in Vollremission in unserer Abteilung mit einer TBI vor einer BMT behandelt. Die TBI wurde entweder mit einer Einzeldosis (STBI; n = 190:10 Gy L4, 8 Gy Lungen) oder in sechs Fraktionen (FTBI; n = 136: an drei aufeinanderfolgenden Tagen 12 Gy L4, 9 Gy Lungen) appliziert. Die Mfinner/Frauen-Ratio betrug 204/122 (1,67), und das mediane Alter betrug 30 Jahre (_+ 11, 3-63). Auf3erdem wurden die Patienten in Relation zu drei momentanen Dosisraten analysiert: 118 Patienten waren in der Gruppe mit niedriger Dosisrate (LDR; _< 0,048 Gy/min), 188 wurden mit mittlerer Dosisrate (MDR; > 0,048 und < 0,09 Gy/min) und 20 mit einer hohen Dosisrate (HDR: > 0,09 Gy/min) bestrahlt. Die konditionierende Chemotherapie bestand aus Cyclophosphamid (CY) alleine bei 250 Patienten, CY und anderen Medikamenten bei 54 Patienten, und 22 Patienten wurden mit Kombinationen ohne CY behandelt. Nach der TBI wurden allogene und autologe BMT bei respektive 118 und 208 Patienten durchgeftihrt. Das mediane Follow-up betrug 68 Monate (67 _+ 29, 24 bis 130 Monate).",

Das LFS betrug 36% in der STBI-und 45% in der FTBI-Gruppe (p = 0,17). Es betrug 36% in der LDR-, 42% in der MDR-und 30% in der HDR-Gruppe (p > 0,05). Die RI betrug 50% in der STBI-, 43% in der FTBI-, 55% in der LDR-, 41% in der MDR-und 44% in der HDR-Gruppe (STBI vs. FTBI, p = 0,48 : LDR vs. MDR, p = 0,03 ; MDR vs. HDR, p = 0,68). Die TRM wurde durch die unterschiedlichen Bestrahlungstechniken nicht signifikant beeinflu6t. Bei der getrennten Analyse des Einflusses der Fraktionierung und der momentanen Dosisrate bei ANLL-oder ALL-Patienten wurde kein Unterschied for das Uberleben oder das LFS beobachtet. Die Fraktionierung beeinflul3te die RI weder bei den ANLL-noch bei den ALL-Patienten. Jedoch war bei den ANLL-Patienten die RI signifikant h6her (58%) in der LDR-als in der MDR-Gruppe (31%, p = 0,001), die momentane Dosisrate zeigte abet keinen signifikanten Einfluf3 auf die RI bei ALL-Patienten. Die Ftinf-Jahres-TRM-Rate war in der allogenen BMT-Gruppe bei den ANLL-(37%) und ALL-Patienten (37%) signifikant h6her als bei der autologen BMT-Gruppe (ANLL 15%, ALL 18%; respektive p -0,002 und 0,02). Die Ftinf-Jahres-Inzidenzraten ftir die interstitielle Pneumonitis (IP) und Katarakt betrugen 22% respektive 19% bei allen Patienten. Die IP-Inzidenz schien h6her zu sein in der HDR-(46%) als in der MDR-(19%, p = 0,05) und LDR-Gruppe (25%, p = 0,15). Aul3erdem wurde die Kataraktinzidenz signifikant durch die Fraktionierung (STBI vs. FTBI, 29% vs. 9%, p = 0,003) und die momentane Dosisrate (LDR vs. MDR vs. HDR, 0% vs. 27% vs. 33%, p < 0,0001) beeinflul3t. Multivarianzanalysen zeigten folgende Hauptfaktoren, die die Uberlebensraten beein-flul3ten: erste Vollremission (p -0,0007), Alter < 40 Jahre (p = 0,003) und BMT nach 1985 (p = 0,008). Die RI wurde unabhfingig nur durch den Remissionsstatus beeinflul3t. AuBerdem war die TRM-Rate niedriger bei Patienten, die keine Graft-vs.-Host-Reaktion (GvHD, p < 0,0001) hatten, und bei den Patienten, die nach 1985 behandelt wurden. GvHD war der einzige unabhfingige Faktor in der Entwicklung der IP (p = 0,01). Ftir die Kataraktinzidenz land sich als einziger unabhangiger Faktor die momentane Dosisrate (p -0,0008). Schlugfolgerungen: Die Prognose tier BMT-Patienten, die mit einer TBI bei akuter Leuk~imie behandelt wurden, wurde nicht dutch die TBI-Technik signifikant beeinfluf3t, und die TRM schien bei den Patienten, die nach 1985 behandelt wurden, niedriger auszufallen. Augerdem wurde die Kataraktinzidenz dutch die momentane Dosisrate signifikant beeinflul3t. SchliisselwOrter: TBI. Dosisrate . Fraktionierung . Akute Leukiimie 9 BMT Strahlenther.

The events were death (all causes of death included) for overall survival, relapse for RI, and relapse and/or death for LFS. When computing the TRM, the event was considered by all causes of death except relapses (patients who relapsed were censored at time of death), and for the IP and cataract incidence rates, patients who died without having developed IP or cataract were censored at time of death. The analysis of the data was realized in July 1994. Differences between groups were assessed using the logrank test [38] . Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from standard errors. Multivariate analyses were done using the Cox stepwiseregression analysis to determine the independent contribution of each prognostic factor thought to be influencing the different analyzed events [16] .

Among the patients with ANLL, neither the fractionation nor the instantaneous dose rate seemed to influence the survival, whereas in the A L L group, patients receiving FTBI did better (45.1%) than those receiving STBI (27.2%, p = 0.02).

Both fractionation and instantaneous dose rate had no significant influence on the outcome after adjustment for other prognostic factors. When considering all patients together, the only independent factor influencing the RI was the remission status (p = 0.0002). Survival was influenced independently by the remission status (p = 0.0007), age (p = 0.003), and year of BMT (p = 0.008). The factors influencing independently the LFS were remission status (p = 0.003), and age (p = 0.01). On the other hand, TRM was significantly lower in patients who did not experience GvHD (p < 0.0001), and in those treated after 1985 (p = 0.0005). When analyzing separately the patients with A N L L or ALL, remission status was the only independent factor influencing the RI (respectively, p = 0.03 and 0.003), survival (respectively, p = 0.004 and 0.01), or LFS (respectively, p = 0.01 and 0.02) in both groups.

            "text": "It is a generally accepted fact that leukemic cells and their normal counterparts are highly radiosensitive [27] . Although the data reported over the years generally confirm a high radiosensitivity and low repair capacity of leukemic stem cells, a number of exceptions have also been observed: decreasing the dose rate or increasing the number of fractions could affect the repair capacity of the leukemic cells [28, 39, 50] . The experimental data suggest that a fractionated scheme or low dose rate irradiation would probably be less effective against leukemia than STBI delivering the same dose, or high dose rate TBI [59] [60] [61] . However, clinical data do not show a higher incidence of relapse with the use of low dose rate and/or fractionated TBI [I0, 26, 36, 55] , with the exception of a few reports [44] . On the other hand, 15-Gy hyperfractionated TBI is reported to be more effective in terms of leukemic cell kill than 10-Gy (4 to 7 cGy/min) STBI [46] . Nevertheless, relatively small changes in the TBI dose have been reported to be an influencing factor on mixed hematopoietic chimerism following T-cell-depleted allogeneic BMT, which could influence the relapse rate [12] . Furthermore, it is even reported that hematopoietic recovery after 10-Gy acute TBI in a radiation accident was possible without BMT [2] . Our data revealed that, when considering the influence of fractionation in all patients, no difference was observed between the STBI and FTBI groups in terms of RI. However, when considering the instantaneous dose rate, patients in the LOW group had higher 5-year RI than those in the MEDIUM (p = 0.03) or HIGH (p = 0.11) groups. Both in the ANLL and ALL group of patients, fractionation did not significantly influence the RI. When considering the instantaneous dose rate separately in the ANLL patients, the 5-year RI was significantly higher in the LOW group than in the MEDIUM group (p = 0.001), whereas the instantaneous dose rate did not seem to influence the RI in ALL patients (Table 2 ). Malignant cells in ANLL could be more sensitive to the changes in the TBI dose rate than those in ALL, which was also demonstrated by the experimental studies [39, 59] . However, following the adjustment with various prognostic factors, multivariate analyses revealed that the only independent factor significantly influencing the RI was the remission status, either in all patients or separately in ANLL and ALL patients.",

            "text": "Theoretically, the therapeutic index is increased with better preservation of healthy tissues when using low dose rate and/or fractionation [21, 22, 52] . The choice of an optimal TBI regimen depends on several factors, including the technical difficulties (e. g., type and energy of treatment machine, time spent in low dose rate TBI, fractionation taking up the machine time for more than 1 day). When considering the late complications and the TRM, fractionated or hyperfractionated TBI seems to be better than single-dose TBI [15, 20, 45, 47, 48, 51] , as well as low dose rate TBI better than high dose rate TBI [3, 4, 40, 58] . In our study, the main causes of TRM were GvHD, IP, VOD, and infections. Animal experiments demonstrated clear improvement in dogs treated with autologous BMT conditioned with fractionated TBI [19] . TBI was reported to be an important factor influencing the TRM. According to Vrieseudorp [62, 63] , there is an important sparing of normal tissues like lung and intestines to be expected with more fractionated regimens. Cliff et al. [13] reported that increasing the dose of fractionated TBI from 12 to 15.75 Gy increased the TRM. The Seattle group [55] observed a significant survival advantage in patients treated with fractionated TBI, with a lower death rate related to non-leukemia related causes. Sutton et al. [51] concluded that the only independent predictive factor influencing the TRM was the TBI regimen (fractionated vs. single dose) in their series of 184 adult acute leukemia patients in first CR trans-planted with allogeneic BMT. In our series, stepwise multivariate analyses concluded that the TBI regimen was not a significant factor affecting survival and LFS when analyzing either all patients together, or ANLL and A L L patients separately. The same multivariate analysis revealed that the 2 independent predictive factors influencing the TRM rate were the year of BMT and the presence of GvHD, which was strongly related with allogeneic BMT (Table 4 ). One possible explanation for a lower incidence of TRM in patients treated after 1985 is the GvHD prophylaxis: after 1985, the majority of our patients transplanted with allogeneic BMT received a combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate, which is reported to decrease the incidence of GvHD in several studies [29] .",

            "text": "Interstitial pneumonitis is one of the most important post-BMT complications. It involves mostly the pulmonary interstitium as a mononuclear cell infiltration and relatively moderate fluid accumulation. GvHD seems to be the leading cause of IP in patients treated with allogeneic BMT [4, 14, 30, 51, 65] . There is also evidence that IP is influenced independently by the total TBI dose, total dose to the lungs, dose rate, and fractionation. However, irradiation is not the only cause. The International Bone Marrow Transplantation Registry data, in which doses delivered to the lungs and the use or not of pulmonary shielding were not thoroughly analyzed, showed no correlation between the type of TBI used and the incidence of IP [65] . CY given 24 h before or after TBI could also affect the incidence of IP [66] , and the effect of CY on radiation pneumonitis seems to be dose dependent [37, 66] . In the randomized trial of the Seattle group [55] , the IP incidence was not found to be significantly different between the single-dose (10 Gy in 1 day, 6 cGy/min) and fractionated TBI (2 Gy x 6 fractions, 1 fraction/day) groups. Shank et al. [47, 48] observed a clear decrease in IP incidence with hyperfractionated TBI (15 Gy, 6 to 19 cGy/min, 1.25 Gy 3 times a day) compared to single-dose TBI (10 Gy). Kim et al. [26] compared 2 different TBI regimens in ANLL patients treated with allogeneic BMT. Thirtysix patients were conditioned with STBI (7.5 Gy, 25 cGy/min), and 48 using hyperfractionated TBI (13.2 Gy, 1.65 Gy twice a day, 10 cGy/min). They did not find any difference in IP incidence between the 2 groups. Others have postulated that low dose rate STBI (about 5 to 6 cGy/min) is less toxic [3, 4, 40] . In our previously reported series [36] , which was randomized on 2 different instantaneous dose rates in 157 patients with various hematological malignancies, neither dose rate (3 vs. 6 cGy/min in FTBI, 6 vs. 15 cGy/min in STBI) nor fractionation (STBI vs. 6 x 2 Gy over 3 consecutive days) significantly influenced the IP incidence. GvHD remains an important complication following allogeneic BMT [64] , and its incidence does not seem to be related with the TBI regimen. Our present study shows that the 5-year IP incidence was influenced neither by fractionation nor by the type of BMT, but its incidence seemed to be higher in the HIGH group (46%) compared to the MEDIUM (19%, p = 0.05) or LOW (25%, p = 0.15) groups. In the allogeneic BMT group, GvHD influenced significantly the 5-year IP incidence (40% in GvHD+ vs. 18% in GvHD-patients, p = 0.04), and it was the only independent factor involved in the development of IP (p --0.01) in multivariate analysis. Moreover, in a recent analysis of an homogeneous series of 186 autologous BMT patients, which exclude the effect of GvHD, we reported a significant influence of instantaneous dose rate on the IP incidence, both in the univariate and in multivariate analyses [34] .",

Several factors like pretherapeutic hepatic condition, the use of different chemotherapeutical agents and the irradiation dose can influence the risk of VOD [31, 32, 34] . Deeg et al. [20] reported a VOD incidence of 52% after 10-Gy STBI vs. 19% after 12-Gy FTBI (p = 0.02). Cosset et al. [15] , in their non-randomized comparison between single-dose and fractionated TBI, found a better therapeutic index favoring fractionated TBI in terms of VOD. Others report a decrease in the VOD incidence with a dose rate below 6 cGy/min both in animal experiments [58] and retrospective studies [3] . Ganem et al. [23] , in their series of 151 allogeneic BMT patients conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy and STBI (10 Gy, 3 cGy/min), found that the only independent factors influencing the incidence of VOD were high serum transaminase levels before BMT, and female gender. Neither in our previous randomized [36] nor in our non-randomized [8] studies did we observe any influence of TB! regimen on VOD incidence. Furthermore, the type of medical prevention did not have an influence on the latter's incidence.",

            "text": "Cataract formation in the crystalline lens of the eye is a well-recognized complication in patients treated with TBI [7, 11, 18, 26, 33, 57] . Deeg et al. [18] , in their series of 181 BMT patients conditioned with BelkacOmi et aL: Total-Body Irradiation prior to Bone Marrow Transplantation for Acute Leukemia TBI, observed 70 cataracts during a median follow-up period of 47 months for single-dose, and 30 months for fractionated TBI regimens using a dose rate from 4 to 8 cGy/min. The estimated cataract incidence (80% in STBI vs. 19% in FTBI) was significantly different between the 2 groups. Kim et al. [26] observed 15 cataracts from 10 to 60 months (12/36 in STBI0 median follow-up: 107 months; 3/48 in hyperfractionated TBI, median follow-up: 27 months) in 84 patients, with a 3-year estimated incidence of 27% in STBI group compared with 12% in the hyperfractionated TBI group (p > 0.05). Calissendorff and Bolme [11] reported that, in their series of 43 pediatric leukemia patients, all children who were followed for at least 3 years (n = 37) developed cataracts following STBI (10 Gy, 4 cGy/min). The Basel group [57] concluded that lens opacification developed later in fractionated TBI patients than in STBI patients, and progression of the lens opacification was slower (p < 0.01). In our prospective study of 157 patients randomized according to instantaneous dose rate both in STBI and FTBI regimens, the instantaneous dose rate and fractionation significantly influenced the 5-year estimated cataract incidence, but multivariate analysis, which took into consideration the influences of fractionation, dose rate, and steroid therapy, revealed that the only independent factor influencing the cataractogenesis was the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.04) [33] . In our recent evaluation of 494 BMT patients with various hematological malignancies conditioned with either STBI or FTBI, we observed statistically significant differences in terms of 5-year cataract incidence between the STBI (34%) and the FTBI (11%, p = 0.0004) groups, as well as low (3.5%), medium (30%) and high (54%; low vs. medium, p = 0.0001; low vs. high, p < 0.0001) instantaneous dose rate groups [7] . Nevertheless, multivariate analysis revealed the protective effect on eyes of low instantaneous dose rate and intravenous administration of heparin against VOD. In the present series, 25 patients developed cataracts (20 in 190 patients in the STBI group and 5 in 136 patients in the FTBI group) during a median follow-up period of 68 months. When considering the 5-year estimated cataract incidence, in univariate analyses, both fractionation and instantaneous dose rate were found to influence cataract development ( Figure 5 ). The protective effect of heparin [7] , which was an interesting finding, could not be observed after the evaluation in multivariate analysis, which revealed that the only independent factor influencing cataractogenesis was the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.0008).",

IP incidence was also significantly influenced by the presence of GvHD. The addition of other drugs to cyclophosphamide in conditioning chemotherapy has been related to increased incidence of VOD of the liver.
