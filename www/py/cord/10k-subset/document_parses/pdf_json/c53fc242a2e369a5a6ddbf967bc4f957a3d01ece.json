In contrast, there were noticeable differences regarding secondary febrile episodes. Overall, one-third of patients had secondary episodes; patients receiving allogeneic BMT, especially unrelated marrow donor recipients, had a significantly higher proportion of secondary episodes than did autografted patients (40% vs 15%;Pp0.0001), irrespective of the duration of neutropenia. The extent of recovery of the host's new immune system, the presence of GVHD and its effects on immune recovery and mucosal barriers, and the use of immunosuppressive agents for prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD are the major determinants of infection in the postengraftment period of BMT. It is conceivable that these mechanisms may also be implicated in our series, since two thirds of the patients who had a secondary episode developed severe acute GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapies, including steroids and antithymocyte globulin (ATG).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the first 100 days after BMT the mortality due to infections was only 2% and reflected the low transplant-related mortality observed in our series (10%).
