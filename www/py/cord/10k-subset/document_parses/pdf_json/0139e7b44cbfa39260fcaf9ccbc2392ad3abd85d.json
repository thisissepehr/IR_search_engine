We previously showed that not all Mtb-specific T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. Thus, an important question is what proportion of T cells elicited by Mtb infection recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We address this question by developing a modified elispot assay using viable Mtb-infected macrophages, a low multiplicity of infection and purified T cells. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 and CD8 T cells were classically MHC restricted. Comparable frequencies of T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages were determined using interferon-\u03b3 elispot and intracellular cytokine staining, and lung CD4 T cells more sensitively recognized Mtb-infected macrophages than lung CD8 T cells. Compared to the relatively high frequencies of T cells specific for antigens such as ESAT-6 and TB10.4, low frequencies of total pulmonary T cells elicited by aerosolized Mtb infection recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. Finally, we demonstrate that BCG vaccination elicits T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We propose that the frequency of T cells that recognize infected macrophages could correlate with protective immunity and may be an alternative approach to measuring T-cell responses to Mtb antigens.",

            "text": "Mtb infection elicits CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in both humans and animal models, and their role in immunity to primary disease is widely appreciated. Numerous vaccine strategies use immunodominant antigens to elicit T-cell responses. Most human and murine vaccine studies rely on using crude Mtb fractions, Mtb peptides or recombinant Mtb proteins as antigens to assess the immunogenicity and function of vaccine-elicited T cells. An underlying assumption has been that most Mtb antigen-specific T cells elicited during natural infection will recognize Mtb-infected antigen presenting cells (APC). However, the parameters used to measure vaccine immunogenicity such as cell numbers or cytokine responses of antigen-specific T cells after stimulation with antigen have not correlated with, or predicted the protective potential of vaccines. 2, 3 Recent data challenge the assumption that all Mtb-antigenspecific T cells primed following infection recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We find that CD8 T cells specific for TB10.4 4\u221211 , an immunodominant epitope in C57BL/6 mice, do not recognize Mtb-infected macrophages and vaccination with TB10.4 4\u221211 does not confer protection. 4, 5 Other studies find that CD4 T cells specific for Ag85b 240-254 , another immunodominant antigen, have a weak response in granulomas due to limited local antigen presentation by infected myeloid cells. 6, 7 Yet optimal control of Mtb in vivo requires direct recognition of infected myeloid cells by CD4 T cells. 8 The chief paradigm of T-cell-based vaccines is that the elicited T cells must recognize Mtb-infected macrophages to confer protection.",

Thus, T cells primed in the lymph nodes during natural infection may not necessarily recognize antigens presented by Mtb-infected macrophages in the lung. 11 Regardless of the mechanism, we wondered whether the inability of some T cells to recognize Mtb-infected macrophages might explain why the number of antigen-specific T cells may not necessarily correlate with vaccine-induced protection.",

Using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), we quantify the frequency of T cells that recognize Mtbinfected macrophages during primary infection in mice. We find that an unexpectedly low frequency of ex vivo CD8 and CD4 T cells recognizes Mtb-infected macrophages. We demonstrate that majority of the T cells from C57BL/6 mice that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages are conventionally MHC-restricted T cells. Our data show that CD4 T cells efficiently detect Mtbinfected macrophages at a lower MOI, whereas CD8 T cells only recognize more heavily infected cells. Using proof-ofconcept vaccination studies, we show that BCG elicits T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We envision this novel assay as a complementary approach to immunogenicity studies and mycobacterial growth inhibition assays. By specifically measuring the frequency of vaccine-elicited T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages pre-challenge, this assay could provide another criterion to help screen and prioritize the selection of T-cell-based vaccines for preclinical and clinical development.",

Although we do not know the identity of these antigens, nearly 80 distinct Mtb proteins have been shown to be recognized by murine T cells (S.M.B., unpublished observation, based on data at IEDB.org).

Overall, we detected a low level of NO produced by T cells after recognition of infected macrophages ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The addition of 1400 W did not change the frequency of MIME+ and MIM-ICS+ T cells, indicating that the frequencies of T cells that recognize Mtbinfected cells is not affected by NO-mediated inhibition. healthy IGRA+ individuals, 23 and which contains epitopes recognized by murine CD4 and CD8 T cells (CSLA, based on data available in the IEDB). The advantage of the megapool compared to other crude Mtb antigens (e.g., culture filtrate proteins, Mtb lysate or PPD) is that the epitopes are present at equimolar concentrations, and as epitopes are in the form of peptides and not proteins, they are efficiently presented by MHC I even when added exogenously to APC. We cocultured lung cells obtained from mice that had been infected for 4 weeks with Mtb-infected macrophages, or with the p300 megapool, and measured IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells. The CD4 T-cell response was skewed more towards the recognition of Mtb-infected macrophages than to the p300 megapool, indicating that some epitopes presented by Mtbinfected murine macrophages are not represented in the p300 megapool. In contrast, the CD8 T-cell response was skewed towards the recognition of the p300 megapool (Fig. 5a) . Thus, CD8 T cells recognize Mtb antigens that are either poorly presented or are not presented by Mtb-infected cells but are represented in the p300 pool (e.g., TB10.4 1\u221215 ). Compared to CD8 T cells, a greater frequency of CD4 T cells recognized Mtb-infected macrophages, indicating that CD4 T cells recognize Mtb-infected cells better than CD8 T cells at this time point (Fig. 5a) . The number of intracellular bacilli could contribute to the differences in CD4 and CD8 T-cell recognitions of infected macrophages. For example, a human CFP10-specific CD8 T-cell clone poorly recognizes Mtb-infected DC unless they are heavily infected. 24 To determine whether the MOI affects polyclonal T-cell recognition of macrophages, purified CD4 and CD8 T cells from the lungs of infected mice were cultured with macrophages infected using a range of MOI, and recognition was measured by MIM-ICS. CD4 T cells readily recognized infected-macrophages, even at a low MOI, and recognition increased at an MOI of 1.2 and plateaued at an MOI of 5.8 (Fig. 5b) . In contrast, there was little or no recognition by CD8 T cells at a low MOI, although recognition increased significantly when the MOI was increased to 5.8. (Fig. 5b) . Thus, pulmonary CD4 T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages with greater sensitivity than CD8 T cells.",

These include the bacilli's intracellular niche, the protein's abundance, and whether it is secreted. Much T-cell-based vaccine development operates under the paradigm that Mtb-specific T cells elicited by natural infection will recognize infected APC. A corollary is that if such T cells can be elicited by vaccination, they will mediate protection against Mtb. Recent data challenge this assumption and show that not all Mtb-antigen-specific T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. 4, 6, 7, 25 This concept is consistent with data from a recent clinical trial where CD8 T cells elicited by an adenoviral-vectored vaccine expressing Mtb antigens either failed to recognize or only modestly recognized Mtb-infected DC. 26 The current paradigm needs to incorporate the possibility that some Mtb antigens, which elicit immunodominant responses, may not be presented by Mtb-infected APC. 4 A strategy to enumerate T-cell recognition of Mtb-infected APC could deepen our understanding of host\u2212pathogen interactions and assist in the development of new vaccines.",

            "text": "We developed the MIME to quantify T cells that recognize Mtbinfected macrophages. A majority of infected myeloid cells from the lungs contain 1-5 bacteria per cell. 12 To mimic in vivo conditions, we used an effective median MOI of 5, which resulted in infection of 70% of the macrophages without compromising their viability. These were important considerations since bystander APC can present antigens released from Mtb-infected cells or from dying cells, as described for DC. 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] We hypothesized that there would be a discrepancy between the frequency of T cells that recognize peptide epitopes versus Mtb-infected macrophages. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a minority of purified CD4 and CD8 T cells from the lungs of Mtb-infected mice recognized Mtb-infected macrophages, although the frequency was sometimes higher, particularly during chronic infection. In our studies, >90% of the CD8 T cells capable of recognizing Mtbinfected macrophages were class I MHC-restricted. The CD4 b a d c T-cell response was more complicated. In the absence of class II MHC, IL-12 was sufficient to drive noncognate IFN-\u03b3 secretion by a subset of pulmonary CD4 T cells. When IL-12 was blocked, we found that majority of the IL-12-driven IFN-\u03b3 secretion was abrogated, and >80% of the CD4 T cells were class II MHC-restricted. A similar observation was made for IL-18, which can drive antigen-experienced CD4 T cells to secrete IFN-\u03b3 following Salmonella infection. 14, 18 Our data show that WT Mtbinfected macrophages are recognized by CD4 T cells in the presence of a strong TCR stimulus, and this recognition is independent of IL-12. An important finding is that, based on our IFN-\u03b3 elispot assay, the combined frequency of CD4 T cells recognizing Ag85b 240\u2212254 and ESAT-6 3\u221217 , two epitopes known to be presented by infected macrophages, accounts for only one third of the polyclonal CD4 T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. The case is even more extreme for CD8 T cells. It is unknown whether 32a 93\u2212102 is presented by Mtb-infected macrophages; but TB10.4 4\u221211 is not. 4 Thus, fewer than 10% of the total CD8 T cells that recognize Mtbinfected macrophages can be accounted for by known epitopes. Consistent with these observations, our MIM-ICS data strongly suggest that there are other epitopes for CD4 T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages but are not represented in the multipeptide pool 300. Conversely, there are epitopes for CD8 T cells that may not be efficiently presented by Mtb-infected macrophages but are overrepresented in the multipeptide pool 300. The megapool consists of Mtb epitopes recognized by human CD4 T cells and a peptide pool designed for the mouse is not available. Although there is overlap between the epitopes recognized by human and murine T cells, there are likely to be differences in MHC-binding and immunodominance between the two species. Thus, if a peptide pool were available for C57BL/6 mice, we might expect that frequency of T cells recognizing peptide epitopes to increase, which would lead to a larger discrepancy between the repertoire of T cells that recognize Mtb antigens and those that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. Our data for MIM-ICS and multipeptide pool 300 are obtained using mice infected for 4 weeks, and the recognition pattern represents differences in CD4 and CD8 T-cell biology during TB infection at this time. It may be interesting for future studies to assess if different skewing patterns may emerge during chronic phases of infection, especially since CD8 T-cell recognition of infected macrophages increases during chronic phases.",

Fortunately, both the ELISPOT and ICS assays can be modified to detect more than one cytokine. A second limitation is the focus on antigens that are presented during the first 48 h of in vitro infection. An interesting issue was that the frequency of epitope-specific T cells differed between assays. 21, 31, 32 Key differences in methodologies and the timing (see Methods) make direct comparisons difficult. Similar discrepancies between elispot and ICS assays were previously found for the T-cell response to protein antigens. 32 For the class II MHCrestricted peptide epitopes, ICS led to a greater calculated frequency than tetramers or elispot, while for the class I MHCrestricted epitopes, the frequency based on tetramer staining and ICS were similar, and greater than that determined by the elispot assay. One possibility is that the class II tetramers may inefficiently detect low affinity antigen-specific T cells, which may be more sensitively detected by dodecamers. 33 Regardless, both the Mtbinfected macrophage ELISPOT and the Mtb-infected macrophage ICS assay yield similar frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages.",

Additionally, macrophage phagosomes are more degradative compared to DC phagosomes, which may lead to differences in antigen presentation. 38, 39 Limited information is available concerning the capacity of ex vivo T cells to recognize Mtb-infected cells. 24, [34] [35] [36] [37] [40] [41] [42] Barriers to these experiments include the low frequency of antigen-specific T cells in human blood and technical difficulties using live Mtb-infected cells, especially macrophages. Most human and murine studies use DC as the infected cell. 40 Although the Flynn lab assessed lymph node and lung T-cell recognition of Mtb-infected DC, these studies found very low frequencies of T cells that recognized Mtb-infected DC. 40, 43 Possible confounders include the use of total lung cells instead of purified T cells and the reliance on anti-MHCI or anti-MHCII antibodies to estimate the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing Mtb-infected DC, respectively. The interpretation of data using class II MHC blocking antibodies is problematic because of noncognate activation of CD4 T cells, as we observed (Fig. 3) . While the Lewinsohn lab found that human CD4 and CD8 T cells recognize Mtb-infected DC, and CD8 T cells recognize heavily infected DC, T-cell clones were used for this study. Since macrophages play an important role in Mtb biology and disease progression, [44] [45] [46] we wanted to assess T-cell recognition of Mtbinfected macrophages. Using a tractable system that allows the use of Mtb-infected macrophages at a median MOI of~5, we report the ex vivo frequencies of primary T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages post-infection and post-BCG vaccination.",

Why then, despite an apparent increase in the frequency MIME + T cells late during infection, is there a failure to control the lung bacterial burden? Such T cells may become dysfunctional 47 or fail to be optimally positioned to interact with infected APC. 48, 49 Another possibility is that infected macrophages inefficiently present bacterial antigens to T cells, either because of active immune evasion or APC dysfunction. Alternatively, antigen presentation by Mtb-infected cells could be limited because when intracellular bacilli are present at low numbers (i.e., <5 bacilli/cell) or are metabolically quiescent, there is little antigen available for presentation. Our data that polyclonal CD8 T cells preferentially recognize Mtb-infected macrophages at higher MOIs are consistent with published data showing human CD8 T-cell clones preferentially recognize heavily infected DC. 24 Furthermore, we show that CD4 T cells are better able to recognize Mtb-infected macrophages at a higher MOI and their ability is also limited at lower MOIs. Whether this disparity could also be affected by differences in macrophages vs. DC, mouse vs. human APCs, or ex vivo vs. cultured T cells, remains to be determined. It would be interesting to characterize CD4 and CD8 T cells that can recognize low-MOI-infected macrophages as this may identify antigens that are more likely to be presented during natural infection or post- a Splenic T cells were enriched by negative selection from the agematched control (open symbols) or BCG-vaccinated (closed symbols) mice, 4\u22125 weeks after immunization. The MIME assay was used to determine the frequency of T cells that recognized Mtb-infected macrophages. In addition, the frequency of Mtb epitope-specific T cells among these T cells was determined by coculture with uninfected macrophages and the respective peptides. Data are combined showing three individual mice per experiment from 2 to 3 experiments (different symbols) (n = 9 mice for MIME response; n = 6 mice for peptide response). Each point is an average of duplicate two replicates. b BCG-vaccinated or control C57BL/6 mice (n = 7/group) were challenged 9 months post vaccination using aerosol Mtb infection and CFU in the lungs and spleens was assessed at 4 wpi. Data from one representative experiment are shown challenge. Increasingly, we favor the idea that vaccine failure has little to do with the quality of the T cells that are elicited; instead, the problem is that vaccine-elicited T cells may not recognize infected APC that harbor few bacilli.",
