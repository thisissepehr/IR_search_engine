Indeed, the attraction of personalized medicine is the promise it holds out to help individuals get the ''right medicine for the right problem at the right time.'' Research biobanks are an effective tool in the genomic medicine toolbox. Biobanking in public health presents a unique case study to unpack some of these issues in more detail. For example, there is a long history of using banked tissue obtained under clinical diagnostic conditions for later public health uses. But despite the collectivist approach of public health, the principles applied to the ethical challenges of biobanking (e.g. informed consent, autonomy, privacy) remain individualist. We demonstrate the value of using human rights as a public health ethics framework to address this tension in biobanking by applying it to two illustrative cases.",

One definition of public health illustrates its breadth and focus: the promotion of health and the prevention of disease and disability; the collection and use of epidemiological data, population surveillance, and other forms of empirical quantitative assessment; a recognition of the multidimensional nature of the determinants of health; and a focus on the complex interactions of many factors -biological, behavioral, social, and environmental -in developing effective interventions (Childress et al. 2002) .",

In short, public health programs deliver to populations health benefits that cannot be effectively secured on an individual or small group basis (Childress et al. 2002) .",

It envisions medical care in which ''drugs and drug doses are made safer and more effective because they are chosen according to an individual's genetic makeup'' (Lesko 2007) . Others, such as the Ickworth Group (Burke et al. 2010) , characterize personalized medicine as any medical ''care that is tailored to the individual or stratified by the population subgroup''. Common to all of these definitions is the emphasis on customizing therapy to the individual patient. Indeed, for as long as clinicians have been caring for patients, medicine has been personalized (Ramsey 1961) , but it is the accelerant of genetic technology that has led some to think that today's medicine has the potential to be even more ''personalized'' than its historical predecessors.",

            "text": "Of course, with the benefit of further reflection, the contrast between personalized medicine and public health is not so stark. For instance, the collectivist approach of public health does not preclude a role for clinical interventions and choices at the individual level. Moreover, the claim that the treatment of a sick individual improves the health of the population of which she is a member is all but tautologous. Vaccination is an example that fits both conditions. Seen this way, personalized medicine and public health are not mutually exclusive, but rather incompletely overlapping. The goals of public health practice certainly include the impact on the health of individuals, and included in the potential value of a genomic approach to medical care is its generalizability to the public's health, for example through better screening and prevention programs (Burke et al. 2010 ). Recognition of this potential for demonstrating the relationship between public health and genomics is evident in a new area of study complete with its own journal, Public Health Genomics that hopes to address some of these very issues. It has been noted, for instance, that a better understanding of what lies between the genes that make up the genome, the role of the environment on gene expression and the role of the interaction between genes will help us to know why some individuals remain healthy while others are more susceptible to genetic diseases. This understanding will also benefit the public health sector where the prevention and expression of communicable and infectious diseases, for example, is related in part to understanding genetic susceptibility\u2026 ).",

The completion of the human genome sequence (and other genomes) greatly expanded the capacity of science to use and obtain greater value from both previously collected biological specimens and those still to be collected (Meslin and Quaid 2004) . For example, the international community, led by Canadian researchers, was able to rapidly sequence the SARS virus from obtained specimens (Marra et al. 2003) . Others used similar technology for the H1N1 virus (Graham et al. 2011; Zhang and Chen 2009 ), dramatically shortening the time it took to understand the nature of the threat and prepare a public health response. Moreover, the prospect of using genome technology on already stored specimens for enhanced genetic diagnostics, drug development, and even domestic and international security threat analysis (Meslin 2003; Bugl et al. 2007; Atlas 2002 ) offers a glimpse into the future of a genetically-informed public health capacity for nation-states. Indeed, it is the fortuitous combination of genomics and pharmacology that gives rise to the most promising example of personalized medicine-the field of pharmacogenomics (Evans 2006; Evans et al. 2004; Desta and Flockhart 2007) .",

In other words, while we acknowledge that the boundary between the two domains is by no means a stark one; the failure to appreciate what makes them different may prevent productive engagement between these two domains of health care to serve the health interests of society.",

            "text": "Several explanations have been offered for why public health approaches to health and disease differ from clinical medical approaches, each of which have ethical valence. One theory credits medicine's increasing focus early in the twentieth century on treating the biological causes of disease, and public health's contrasting occupation with the social and environmental causes of illness, resulting in efforts geared toward health promotion and prevention (Khoury et al. 2007 ). The vectors of medicine and public health diverged further when schools of medicine and public health in the United States were officially separated in 1916 (Khoury et al. 2007 ), in part due to the conflicting goals of professionals in the fields (Porter 2006) . Additional ideas include ''the rise of medical authority with the expansion of hospital-based specialist practices'' (Porter 2006) as well as a corresponding split between individualist and collectivist modes of analysis in the social sciences (Arah 2009 ). This disciplinary, professional and institutional dissociation between the two fields has been blamed for the current gap between personal medical care and public health (Arah 2009 ).",

Tellingly, Nancy E.

            "text": "Another reason an individualist outlook has prevailed in bioethics is that some public health interventions are conducted on the individual rather than the population level. For instance, postwar antismoking campaigns in Great Britain set a trend that involved educating and influencing individual behavior and lifestyles (Porter 2006) . The approach, later adopted to combat heart disease, obesity and cancer, helped solidify the individualist and behavioral model already prevalent in clinical medicine (Beauchamp 1985; Porter 2006) . Hence, the population perspective implicit in public health ethics was at times at odds with the individualist methods employed to serve the public's health. A further rationale for the individualist bias of Hum Genet (2011) 130:451-463 453 bioethics is the backlash against the misuse of populationbased policies in the field of eugenics, resulting in an understandable suspicion of collectivist bioethical analysis (Pernick 1997; Kirkman 2005; Lombardo 2011 ). These factors have combined to generate a rich framework for ethical analysis, but one that has remained individualist in orientation. The inadequacy of the framework was noted by bioethicists such as Dan E. Beauchamp who argued, against the prevailing political valorization of individual autonomy, that a framework that privileged ''individual interests'' and ''market justice'' was detrimental to public health (Kass 2004 ). Beauchamp suggested that public health might require its own ''ethic,'' a proposal taken up by Marc Lapp\u00e9 (1986) who differentiated medical ethics from public health ethics.",

The Code is relatively narrow in scope, catering primarily to an audience in traditional public health institutions such as public health departments and schools of public health (Thomas et al. 2002) . Moreover, it focuses on public health practice rather than research, and has in view the United States' public health system.

Human rights can be traced back to the ancient world, but we describe here the prevailing view, which has origins in the writings of such philosophers as Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes, Jean Jacques-Rousseau and John Locke. Modern human rights assume that all persons possess inherent dignity and certain inalienable rights by the simple fact of their being human. The words ''inherent'' and ''inalienable'' mean these things belong to them naturally and are not granted to them by any political authority. To advance their individual and common well-being, however, people give up certain rights to set up a government that serves their needs.",

On this view, the government exists to ensure the well-being of the individuals who give up certain rights in exchange for certain protections and benefits from the government. The same applies to the community they jointly establish. From this analysis, the traditional roles of government include such things as collective security, the administration of justice, the protection of property and, relevant for our purposes, the promotion of the public's health. Seen in this way, a human rights perspective provides an ethical framework for describing the conditions under which the government can protect and promote both individual and community well-being.",

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) (ICCPR) reflected the capitalist and liberal emphasis on such rights as free speech, freedom of movement, freedom of religion, the right to vote and the right to privacy. These civil and political rights required governments to refrain from interfering with the liberties of their individual citizens.",

In part due to their being costlier than civil and political rights and also because of their questionable justiciability (i.e., their enforcement in courts of law) (Tarantola 2008) , social and economic rights were not given the same priority as civil and political rights by governments. The main result of this focus on individualist civil and political rights is that many governments have not invested as heavily in addressing issues at societal or population level-issues such as housing, education and health. Hence, human rights norms in the twentieth century have developed along broadly individualist rather than collectivist lines.",

He notes that ''[a]s our world becomes increasingly interconnected and threats to the global public health continue to proliferate, it is hard to see how the global governance of health could be managed without assigning an integral role to human rights''. The reasons he provides in support of a human rights framework include the fact that much biomedical activity has clear human rights implications (e.g., the rights to life and physical integrity); human rights have developed into a transcultural ethical discourse with the potential for setting common standards; and there are few if any other viable mechanisms that can serve as a ''global normative foundation''. Considering the then incipient UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, T. A. Faunce (2005) noted the increasing application of human rights to address challenges traditionally considered within the sole purview of bioethics and medical ethics. In the narrower context of genomics, Knoppers (2000) has argued that benefit-sharing in the context of genetic research ''is an aspect of fundamental human rights and serves to counterbalance the effects of commercialization and patenting''. She has also proposed human rights as a compelling model for policy governing new genetic technologies (Knoppers 2004) .",

His first criticism is that such a framework pays inadequate attention to the structural and social effects of genetic information. He argues that because economic, racial, ethnic and power disparities already exist between groups in societies, genetic information used without ethical oversight can exacerbate these differences and result in discrimination and exclusion. Iles infers that human rights may adequately protect individuals facing genetic profiling in employment or insurance contexts, but it is questionable whether the framework's individualist lens can monitor the effects of genetic information on relations between and among groups. Iles' second criticism of the applicability of human rights as a foundation for ethical uses of genomics is that individual freedom of choice regarding the use of genetic information can have an aggregate population-wide effect. For example, the choice parents make to have a ''normal'' child rather than one with a ''comparatively inert and tolerable'' disorder is not only heavily influenced by society's values but also determines eventually the society's constitution (Iles 1996) . A narrow focus on individual choice, therefore, may obscure the effects of the uses of genetic information on a society.",

Until the Declaration's adoption, human rights were concerned primarily with ''the rights of the individual against the state, without much attention to the collective and associational dimensions of human existence beyond the state'' (Anaya 2006) . In an historic shift, the Declaration recognizes rights to indigenous peoples as groups rather than merely as individual members of their communities. It is a particular instance of the ethical principle underlying solidarity rights, which proposes that community is not an elective component of human well-being.

As its official title suggests, the Banjul Charter includes the concept of peoples' rights, which, like the collective rights of indigenous peoples, is a version of group rights. The Banjul Charter deliberately omits a definition of the term ''people,'' thereby leaving the term open to several interpretations, e.g., persons struggling to gain political independence, persons living in a territory and sharing certain characteristics, or simply all people living in a country (Kiwanuka 1988) . Whatever their precise legal definition, peoples' rights in the Banjul Charter are based on the African philosophical belief that a human being is not ''an isolated and abstract individual, but an integral member of a group animated by a spirit of solidarity'' (Kiwanuka 1988) . The kinship between this African principle and the ethical norms undergirding solidarity rights and the rights of indigenous peoples discussed above is evident.

First, it may avoid having to resolve the seemingly interminable debate about the proper approach to obtaining individual informed consent for research using human biological materials. In situations in which groups may be consulted, approached and from which permission to participate in biobanks may be sought, informed consent may be necessary but not a sufficient mechanism for engaging a community. Second, it recognizes the institutionalization and application of human rights discourse at international forums by providing tools for discussing the values of public health across national borders. This is important in light of observations by recent commentators of a linguistic shift with both practical and ethical implications: the gradual transition of the term ''international health'' to ''global health.'' ''International health'' was used to describe a technical endeavor conducted jointly by developing countries and their partners in the industrialized world through such large institutions as the World Health Organization (WHO) and CARE International (Elmendorf 2010) . It was useful in this context to distinguish between ''international'' and ''domestic'' health.",

The shift in terms represents the change from health conceived as an issue for diplomacy and knowledge transfer between countries to health conceived as a common asset and concern of the international community. Importantly, the terminological shift from ''international'' to ''global health'' is also reflected in the bioethics literature (Chadwick et al. 2011) . A specific example of the application of ''global'' rather than ''international'' health is the ''One World, One Health'' initiative, a framework that builds on efforts to contain the avian influenza outbreak (FAO et al. 2008) . The initiative is built on the premise that infectious diseases have potentially national, regional and international effects, thus requiring approaches that are not only ''interdisciplinary'' and ''cross-sectoral'' but indeed global.",

Aided by more robust bioinformatics, genotypic and phenotypic data will be employed with greater frequency to study the significance of genetic variation (Mendoza 2010 ). This will involve the use of larger databases and the consolidation of samples from sites around the globe (Meslin and Goodman 2010; Ickworth 2010) . This raises the obvious challenge of harmonizing norms concerning privacy and confidentiality across jurisdictions and, beyond that, consideration of the varied cultural norms guiding data sharing particularly when information moves between developed and lower and middle income countries (LMIC) (Chalmers 2007; Holman et al. 1999; Asslaber and Zatloukal 2007) .",

We noted also how the change was reflected in the explicit recognition of ''collective'' rights in the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. These rights ''operate at an international level to assure public goods that can only be enjoyed in common with similarly-situated individuals and thus cannot be realized through individual rights claims against the state'' (Meier and Fox 2010) . The premise grounding the recognition of collective rights is that the realization of some human rights is simply not reducible to their exercise by an aggregate of individuals. Harmon (2008) writes that social solidarity has been incorporated, even if implicitly, into UNESCO's major instruments on genomic research, namely the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (1997) and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (2005) . He maintains that the emergent notion of social solidarity mitigates the excesses of modern individualism and is ''grounded in the recognition that individuals are socially embedded''. His analysis of the UNESCO documents describes a solidarity based on the fundamental unity of all humans, a focus on ''the collective, the observance of duties and the creation and preservation, through personal and collective action, of a just and decent society''.",

First, collective rights, premised conceptually on the fact that certain rights can be protected only in groups, is virtually analogous to the population perspective of public health, which presumes that certain health challenges require society-wide, rather than individual, interventions. The kinship of the two perspectives is highlighted in the argument made by Meier and Fox (2010) that public health be recognized as a collective right. Second, the classification of genetic databases as the common heritage of humanity, which precludes private ownership while requiring shared uses and benefits, buttresses the view that biobanks should be managed under principles that consider the whole of humanity rather than narrower interests, no matter how seemingly benign. Again, these principles would share an affinity with the principles of public health that target the health of the whole population. Third, the arguments for the status of genetic information as a non-rivalrous and non-excludable global public good also support an approach to managing biobanks that recognizes the public character of the resource. Together, these features ground the management of international biobanking in a framework that keeps foremost the population perspective of public health.",
