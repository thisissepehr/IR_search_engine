Two versions of the doctrine are considered: Michael Walzer's communitarian version and Brian Orend's prudential one. I investigate first whether the doctrines are applicable to non-antagonistic threats, and second whether they are defensible. I argue that a version of Walzer's doctrine seems to be applicable to non-antagonistic threats, but that it is very doubtful whether the doctrine is defensible. I also argue that Orend's version of the doctrine is applicable to non-antagonistic threats, but that his account is not defensible, regardless of whether the threats are antagonistic or not.",

            "text": "There is a widespread intuition that if a society faces an overwhelmingly horrible threat, then some actions that are ordinarily prohibited might become permissible or even mandatory. Torture, for instance, is usually thought to be absolutely prohibited in the ordinary course of things. However, many people think that in certain extreme circumstances, it may be justified. Suppose that an unusually capable terrorist has planted hydrogen bombs in London, Manchester, and Birmingham, and plans to set them off simultaneously. Time is short, and the only way to stop the bombs from going off is to torture the terrorist into revealing their location. In this situationone of supreme emergencyit can be argued that the absolute ban on torture should be lifted and that the terrorist may, or even should, be tortured. It might even be justifiable to torture or at least threaten to torture innocent people in order to avoid the consequences of the hydrogen bombs. Or so the argument goes. 1 Another example, from the real world, concerns Britain's situation during the Blitz in 1940. Britain responded to the Nazi threat by bombing German cities, thus deliberately targeting non-combatants and thereby blatantly violating the perhaps most firmly established rule of war. Was that justifiable, given the supreme emergency Britain, and not only Britain but also a large part of the civilised world, found itself in? Michael Walzer, the most well-known writer on the supreme emergency argument, argues, hesitantly, that it was (Walzer 2000, Ch. 16) . 2 If we turn to Walzer's definitions of supreme emergencies, we find that he characterises them in two slightly different ways. In his widely known Just and Unjust Wars, he describes a supreme emergency as being defined by two conditions: the nature of the looming danger and its imminence. Both conditions must be fulfilled for a supreme emergency to be present: the danger must be imminent, and, in addition, 'of an unusual and horrifying kind' (Walzer 2000, p. 253) . In a less often-quoted essay entitled 'Emergency Ethics', he states that '[a] supreme emergency exists when our deepest values and our collective survival are in imminent danger' (Walzer 2004, p. 33) . I take the phrase about collective survival and deep values to be a way of making more precise the condition of horribleness. Thus, a supreme emergency is a situation where our deepest values and/or collective survival are in imminent danger.",

I will begin by giving some background on the debate on the supreme emergency argument and its place in the just war tradition. Then I will outline its possible application to non-antagonistic threats. Finally, I will examine two rather different versions of the supreme emergency doctrinethose of Michael Walzer and Brian Orend.

Those who need special permissions are deontologists of some kind, who believe that there are moral absolutes, such as prohibitions, prescriptions, rights or duties that must be upheld, regardless of consequences, but nevertheless want to grant that such moral absolutes may sometimes be suspended or overriddenin extreme situations. 4 This position is known as threshold deontology. 5 'Threshold deontologists share the view that when consequences become extremely grave, what would otherwise be categorically forbidden becomes morally possible', writes Heidi M. Hurd (2002, p. 405) . Or in the words of Michael Walzer, 'the constraints lose their grip, and a certain kind of utilitarianism reimposes itself' (Walzer 2004, p. 40) .",

For a supreme emergency to be present, the threat has to be directed against a community rather than, say, merely against a large number of non-related individuals. Walzer himself is explicit about this, and claims that '[s]upreme emergency is a communitarian doctrine' (Walzer 2004, p. 45) . Second, the threat to the community is usually regarded as antagonistic. Antagonistic threats that are threats brought about by agents with malicious intent. Supreme emergencies are typically not thought to be about threats from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, asteroids or the like. Third, the morally problematic actions supposedly permitted by reference to a situation of supreme emergency are typically thought to be directed against members of the collective that poses the threat, not against innocent bystanders.",

This tradition, dating back at least to Augustine and prominently developed by Aquinas, takes its starting point in the belief that war, while being a bad thing, is sometimes justifiable, and that there are moral limits on how to fight such a just war. In this tradition, two types of issues have been distinguished. One concerns jus ad bellum, or right to war, and the other jus in bello, right in war. The former concerns when war is justified, the latter how war is to be conducted. 6 The principles of jus ad bellum are usually thought to include just cause, right intention, legitimate authority, reasonable hope of success, proportionality, and last resort. This means that a war can be justified only if it has a just cause (such as selfdefence) and if it is carried out for those very reasons, and not, e.g., is carried out for reasons of economic gain with self-defence as a mere excuse. War must also be declared by recognised authorities, e.g. a democratic government. It must also not be doomed to fail from the outset. Furthermore, the expected gains of the war must outweigh the losses. Finally, war must be used as a last resort, when all other possible solutions to a conflict are exhausted.",

The central theme of discrimination is that only some targets, such as soldiers and military installations, are legitimate, and thus allowable to target intentionally.

This is important. There are a number of severe threats that are not antagonistic, but that might, arguably, be at least equally bad as antagonistic ones. 7 Such threats can certainly be imminent as well as particularly horrifying. Take a large outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Bubonic Plague, or some other extremely unpleasant disease.

            "text": "One possibility is that environmental emergencies are thought to call for environmentally benign dictatorship or 'ecofascism' (Zimmerman 1995) . Another, perhaps more important case in point is disease control. Historical examples show that draconian measures in the face of diseases thought to be emerging plagues have sometimes been both advocated and implemented. Calls for such measures were to some extent heard during the early days of the AIDS epidemic (H\u00e4yry and H\u00e4yry 1989) . From earlier times, there are examples of forced removals and draconian punishment for violation of sanitation rules as responses to the threat of yellow fever (Ngalamulume 2004) , as well as that of plague (Kallioinen 2006) . It is also a common but contested idea that societies historically have tended to become more violent in the wake of plagues (Cohn 2002) . There have been arguments advanced that this provides a moral reason to prevent or at least curtail public emergencies. 7 Daniel Statman (2006a, p. 61f.) distinguishes between threats from human beings and threats from natural causes. 'Threats from human beings', or anthropogenic threats, can be of at least two kinds, however. The first is antagonistic threats. In the case of an antagonistic threat, there is an intention to threaten. In other words, there are Bad Guys. Antagonistic threats are thus a special case of anthropogenic ones. The second is where humans are causally responsible for the threat, but where there is no aggressive intention. An example is anthropogenic climate change, which may indeed mean that some communities' survival is at stake. In addition, it seems that non-antagonistic anthropogenic threats can also be divided into subcategories. A threat might unintentionally but culpably be brought about by some agent or group of agents. Or it might unintentionally and non-culpably be brought about by some agent or group of agents. The distinctions between the types of threat are by no means clear. To complicate things further, distinctions between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic threats are no less unclear. For instance, given that hurricanes become more common due to anthropogenic climate change, do hurricanes cease to be natural? Or do they become less natural? And so on.

This must not happen, Sorell thinks, and thus a looming emergency justifies extraordinary measures. There is a parallel in law as well.

Two things might be noted, however: First, quarantine and other non-pharmaceutical interventions are probably not as effective as is sometimes thought, in particular not once the flu has begun spreading among the general population. Second, containment at the sourcesuch as in the case of the Flu-Bug Hatcheryseems at least theoretically possible, using both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical means.

Christopher Toner has called this the institutional specification of a threshold deontological principle. Such a specification would specify the threshold with reference to 'damage that would tend towards the destruction of the institution of morality itself' (Toner 2005, p. 559) . On this view, a particular moral principle is not overridden, but temporarily suspended because of the commitment to the protection of moral principles in general. Toner believes that this is how Michael Walzer's version of the supreme emergency doctrine probably should be interpreted. I agree that this is a reasonable understanding of Walzer, who states that '[a] supreme emergency exists when our deepest values and our collective survival are in imminent danger' (Walzer 2004, p. 33) . This should probably be understood as saying that our deepest values are always at risk when our collective survival, understood as the survival of our community, is at stake. This goes with Walzer's explicit communitarianism: The destruction of our community is more than the destruction of a number of lives, even if that number is very large. 'When our community is threatened ... we face a loss that is greater than any we can imagine, except for the destruction of humanity itself. We face moral as well as physical extinction, the end of a way of life... ' (ibid., p. 43) .",

I am not sure what to make of the claim that utilitarianism, albeit of a certain kind, reimposes itself. Taken literally, the claim is downright mysterious. However, in the same paragraph Walzer explains that supreme emergencies are, however rare, situations when the negative value 'that we can't help assigning' to a looming disaster 'devalues morality itself'. This gives us the liberty to do whatever is necessary to avert the disaster, the only constraint being that our action does not bring about an even worse disaster. However, according to Walzer, absolute deontological constraints can never be suspended. They remain in full force, but in supreme emergencies they may sometimes, and should sometimes, be overridden. This overriding 'leaves guilt behind' (ibid., p. 34). Thus, we have the somewhat paradoxical situation that we may be required to do wrong and still be legitimately criticised for doing what we had to do.",

            "text": "Three things are notable here. First, it seems that utilitarianism does not reimpose itselfrather, we 'cannot help' imposing it. Walzer puts the same point slightly differently when he writes that 'we can only be overwhelmed by supreme emergency' (Walzer 2004, p. 40) . Presumably, it is an empirical psychological issue, and it is not obvious that everyone is as overwhelmed as Walzer supposes. Many of us do have strong intuitions that are consistent with Walzer's, but that is not sufficient in the present context. This leads us to the second point: The work Walzer wants those intuitions to do is to legitimise our doing 'whatever is militarily necessary'. How this comes about is unclear, but, if I understand Walzer rightly, the Kantian dictum of ought implies can is central here. For if we cannot help imposing utilitarianism, then, by modus ponens, it is not the case that we ought to avoid utilitarianism. The third point concerns the one constraint Walzer allows, the requirement that our action does not bring about an even worse disaster. The only example he gives of such a disaster is 'the destruction of humanity itself' (Walzer 2004, p. 43) . It seems like a sound requirement, but it is nevertheless problematic. For how are we to know that we do not bring about an even worse disaster by taking actions that are 'militarily necessary'? Suppose that, contrary to the facts, the US' dropping of nuclear bombs on Japan in 1945 were military necessities in a situation of supreme emergency. The scientists responsible for the building of the bomb seriously considered whether the bomb might trigger a chain reaction affecting the entire atmosphere of the Earth. Their calculations led them to conclude that the possibility could be ruled out. 9 But what if they were wrong? And how are we to know that we do not bring about an even worse catastrophe by attempting to avoid one, under license from the appeal to supreme emergency? The problem has been discussed at length in connection with the so-called precautionary principle and proposed measures to avoid potential environmental disasters. 10 Situations of supreme emergency are typically ones of great urgency, disorder, and even chaos. It is likely that we will thus be less able to assess the consequences of our possible courses of action than in ordinary situations. This means that it will be very difficult to assess whether Walzer's constraint is fulfilled.",

However, it is very doubtful whether the doctrine is defensible. If a community ceases to exist, does this really mean 'moral extinction', and is that necessarily a bad thing? Communities come and go, ways of life change for different reasons, without moral extinction occurring. The doctrine has the following counterintuitive consequences: Suppose that the survival of our community and thus 'our deepest values' is under threat. Let us also take it for granted that there is more than one community in the world. (Walzer seems to allow this, given his distinction between a community and humanity itself.) Suppose further that the only way to save our community from eradication is to do something that kills people both from our community and from other communitiessay, everyone above a certain age. However, those deaths are so distributed that there is no threat of extinction to any community. Some people die here, some there. Nowhere is it the question of 'the end of a way of life'. The number of deaths is extremely large, though, much larger than it would be if only the threat to our own, comparatively small community materialised. 9 The example, from Robert Oppenheimer, is cited in Hansson (1996) . 10 A recent work summing up the argument is Sunstein (2005) . Cf. Sandin et al. (2002) and Stern and Wiener (2006) . I will now turn to a very different version of the supreme emergency doctrine, one presented by Brian Orend (2006) . Orend's work is recent and has not been subject to the same vast amount of scrutiny as Walzer's. I will argue that his position is applicable to supreme emergencies without Bad Guys but that it is not defensible. The latter point, I will argue, is true regardless of whether it is applied to supreme emergencies with antagonistic threats or non-antagonistic ones.",

However, there is a complication to Orend's argument. He claims that in a supreme emergency, 'as a matter of fact any country subjected to it will do whatever it can to prevail. The animal instincts are going to kick in, just as in [an analogous case involving individuals]' (Orend 2006, p. 155, italics in original) . The problem is that animal instincts, supposedly, will kick in for individuals, not for countries. Individuals in a country facing a horrible threat may have prudential strategies quite distinct from those who are most likely to be conducive to the 'survival' of their country. They might consider fleeing, for instance. Even if we substitute 'community' for 'country', the problem remains. Perhaps saying that the animal instincts will kick in for a country or a community is shorthand for saying that they will kick in for individual members of the government (or the equivalent) of that country or community. But then, it sounds both implausible and unpleasant to say that President X's or General Y's animal instincts kicked in and forced them to act in a certain way, since their country was in peril.",

However, his position is that if a supreme emergency prevails, 'instinct' will compel a country to act in a certain way.

Why couldn't there be a situation in which a country faces a supreme emergencyas defined by Orendwithout being in bello, but rather on the brink of war? 'Instinct' will presumably kick in here as well. Given that supreme emergency is about prudential efficacy, as Orend claims, I cannot see that the ad bellum/in bello distinction makes any difference.

At least rules (1), (4) and (5) are recognisable as variants of rules from just-war theory, notably, from the ad bellum part of traditional just war theory. However, in just-war theory, the rules are explicitly moral, not prudential. The very reason for introducing rules of war is that prudential strategies in war leads to immoral acts being committed. In what follows, I will argue that Orend's rules are applicable in the nonantagonistic case.

Second, and more importantly, the rules do not obviously promote efficacy, even as rules of thumb. In discussing appeal to the international community in the antagonistic case, Orend recognises this. The international community has all too often been slow and passive in its reactions to humanitarian emergencies. Examples include Former Yugoslavia and the Darfur region in Sudan. But, furthermore, public declarations can be counterproductive as well. In the example of the Flu Bug Hatchery, if given advance warning from public declarations, the Farm People might hide from the medical officers sent there to force-feed them antivirals, or flee in order to avoid isolation, thus speeding up the spread of the disease even more. It may be prudentially more efficient to keep quiet. And why should we limit our appeal to the international community? If there is someone else who is in a better position to help us, we should do so. It might be better to secretly appeal to a powerful neighbour or perhaps to our enemy's enemy (to use an antagonistic example) than to the international community. Prudentially, we should do what is efficacious, but that may often be contrary to what rules two and three prescribe.

However, it cannot be absolutely vital from a prudential perspective, when we are in a supreme emergency. That we beforehand should look for measures that are likely to be successful when we are in a supreme emergency is true. Once we are there, however, things are different. Consider the Flu Bug Hatchery again. Suppose that we may choose between (a) doing nothing and face near-certain eradication in pandemic flu, and (b) force-feeding risky antivirals to the farm people. Suppose further that the antivirals are new and that their efficacy is questionable. The probability that they will stop the pandemic is very small; still, they are our best shot. Should we choose the do-nothing alternative, since the medical emergency measures do not have a reasonable probability of success? Or is any probability, however slight prudentially, reasonable in supreme emergencies? I am inclined to think so. If there are no other options, then we should, prudentially, grab for the last straw. Furthermore, given that we are in a struggle for survival with animal instincts kicking in, how could we do otherwise? Again, I believe that the allegedly prudential rule is best understood as a case of backdoor morality. Because interpreted as a moral rule, the rule makes sense. It would be morally unacceptable for us to expose the farm people to great risks in order to reduce the risk to ourselves very slightly.
