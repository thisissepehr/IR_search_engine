In the classical approach, the method of network construction is very simple. Nodes in these networks always belong to the same type and links are often undirected and unweighted. This will not explain certain real-world phenomena very well, since significant information is removed in the construction process. In the past few years, with the development of the social network research domain, more complex and feasible network construction methods have been developed. For instance, we can construct social networks in which nodes belong to two different types and links are both directed and weighted [15] [16] [17] [18] . In these networks, nodes may represent people of different genders, occupations, locations, or ages and links represent different friendships, communications, or enmities [3, 19, 20] . One can also construct social networks with hyperedges [21] : links that join more than two nodes together. According to our investigation, we generally classify existing networks construction methods into five basic classes: undirected networks, directed networks, weighted networks, bipartite graphs, and hypergraphs. These five basic network construction methods are compared in Table 2 . Degree and strength distribution: the degree k i of node i is defined as the number of links incident with i. The strength s i in a weighted network denotes the sum of weights of the corresponding links: s i = j w i j , where w i j represents the weight between node i and j. A large number of previous empirical results demonstrate that not all nodes in a social network have the same degree or strength [5, 15, 22, 23] . For an unweighted network, this difference can be characterized by the degree distribution P(k), which gives the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly k edges.

SIR models: the most famous and classical SIR model was originally developed to describe the spread dynamics of epidemics and is now applied to several domains. This model divides the population into three groups: susceptible (S ), infectious (I), and removed (R). S indicates that people who are not infected by the virus but can be easily infected. I represents individuals who are infectious and can transmit the virus to others. R denotes persons in the group who have recovered from the disease or are now dead. This model is based on the hypothesis that any person who belongs to S has the uniform probability \u03b2 to become infected and infected people recover and becomes immune at rate \u03b3. In the limit of populations, this model is represented by the following differential equations:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Macro-level models"}, {"text": "where s(t), i(t), and r(t) are the fractions of individuals in S , I, R respectively and the sum of s(t), i(t), and r(t) is equal to 1. The classic SIR model described above assumes that the population is fully mixed and all individuals are in contact with the others and transmit the disease with same probability. Newman [66] improved on this model and made several modifications. In Newman's model, the probability T i j that an infected node i transmits the virus to node j follows a distri-bution function, which can be determined by several significant parameters [66] . The resulting models are equivalent to uniform bond percolation on the same network with edge occupation probability. We can further define a generation function [24] to obtain the distribution of finite outbreak sizes, the critical transmittability, and relative final size of an epidemic.
