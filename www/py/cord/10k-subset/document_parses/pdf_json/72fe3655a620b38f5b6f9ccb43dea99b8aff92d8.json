More than one viral agent was found in 2.4% (23 patients) of the study population.

All PCR products found to be positive for hBoV were confirmed by sequencing, and the 8 partial sequences of the NP1 gene and the 6 partial sequences of the VP1/VP2 gene were deposited in GenBank (EF441532, EF441534, EF441536-EF441541, and EF441546-EF441550). Direct sequencing of the 8 hBoV-positive PCR products showed that the 4 sequences of the partial NPI gene were completely identical to either ST1 or ST2, the original isolates identified by Allander et al. [2] DISCUSSION In 2005, hBoV was identified in children with LRTI and is now suspected as a likely respiratory pathogen despite the high rate of being codetected with other pathogens [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, the exact clinical role that newly identified hBoV plays in various clinical diseases, especially gastroenteritis, remains unclear. Bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus, which are included in the genus of bocavirus-like hBoV, are important etiologic agents of diarrhea in calves and dogs and have been shown to destroy small intestinal crypt cells, resulting in dilation of crypts and stunting of villi, which results in the infected cells showing prominent intranuclear inclusion bodies [11] . In recent studies [7] [8] [9] , it has been suggested that hBoV possibly plays a role in acute gastroenteritis in children. In the present study, microbial testing for enteropathogenic bacteria and other common viral etiologic agents was performed to delineate the clinical role played by hBoV infection in children hospitalized with gastroenteritis. The bacterial pathogens most commonly found were EAEC, Clostridium species, and EPEC, which are known to have less pathogenicity in young children; and typical bacterial pathogens were found in only 1.1% of the study population. Codetection of viruses was found in 2.4% of the study population, a rate similar to those reported by previous studies [12] . The results of the present study showed that rotavirus and norovirus were the most common agents, and the coinfection detected most frequently was rotavirus and norovirus, which coincided with the outbreak of norovirus infection during the study period. The fact that PCR was used for detection of norovirus and that the less-sensitive ELISA was used for detection of adenovirus and rotavirus may have affected the results. In the present study, the prevalence of astrovirus was lower than that found by previous studies [13] , which may be due not to the sensitivity of primers used but, rather, to the low-prevalence season encompassed by the study period, because we detected astrovirus in 4.1% (33/812) of children hospitalized with gastroenteritis during 2004 [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1330, "end": 1333, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1516, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1520, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1524, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1528, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1532, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2041, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2062, "end": 2065, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2066, "end": 2069, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2073, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2743, "end": 2747, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3271, "end": 3275, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3515, "end": 3519, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "In nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients with acute respiratory-tract infection, the rate at which hBoV has been codetected with other respiratory viruses is 17.6%-55.6% [3, 4, 5, 15] . In the present study, hBoV was codetected with another enteropathogenic virus in 62.5% (5/8) of the hBoV-positive patients, a rate that is consistent with that found in a previous study [9] ; the other 37.5% (3/8) of the hBoV-positive patients did not show any coinfection with a bacterial or viral etiologic agent, which suggests that hBoV possibly plays a role in gastroenteritis. In another study, performed during the same period as that of the present study, we detected hBoV in nasopharyngeal specimens from 7.3% (45/613) of children with acute LRTI, and most (44.4% [20/45]) of these detections occurred during May and June of 2006 [5, 16] . The results of the present study showed that, during the same period, the rate of detection of hBoV in acute gastroenteritis was lower than that in acute LRTI and therefore suggest that hBoV may play a minor role in gastroenteritis. These findings are different from those of a Spanish study [9] , which showed a high (9.1%) prevalence of hBoV in children with gastroenteritis during a winter period, a prevalence that was similar to that (7.7%) which the study found in children with respiratory illness. Although it is still difficult to explain these studies' differences regarding the role that hBoV plays in gastroenteritis, it should be remembered (1) that respiratory bocavirus infection, even in the absence of gastrointestinal bocavirus infection, may cause gastrointestinal disturbance with diarrhea and (2) that, after systemic infection, global excretion of the virus into various compartments is possible, as has been suggested by Allander et al.'s study of children with acute wheezing [17] . Further studies, including asymptomatic control and respiratory specimens from children with gastroenteritis, are warranted to define the role that hBoV plays in gastroenteritis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 172, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 173, "end": 175, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 176, "end": 178, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 179, "end": 182, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 371, "end": 374, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 824, "end": 827, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 828, "end": 831, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1129, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1838, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the present study identified a viral agent in 44.4% of children hospitalized with gastroenteritis.
