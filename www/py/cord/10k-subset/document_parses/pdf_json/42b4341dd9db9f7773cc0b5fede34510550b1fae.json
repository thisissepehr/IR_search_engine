However, the effect and mechanism of polydatin and resveratrol on enterovirus 71 (EV71) have not been reported. In this study, resveratrol revealed strong antiviral activity on EV71, while polydatin had weak effect. Neither polydatin nor resveratrol exhibited influence on viral attachment. Resveratrol could effectively inhibit the synthesis of EV71/VP1 and the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b3, IKB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p50 and NF-\u03baB p65, respectively. Meanwhile, the remarkably increased secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in EV71-infected rhabdosarcoma (RD) cells could be blocked by resveratrol. These results demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited EV71 replication and cytokine secretion in EV71-infected RD cells through blocking IKKs/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Thus, resveratrol may have potent antiviral effect on EV71 infection.",

The common pathogens of HFMD are EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16). EV71 belongs to the Picornaviridae family, and is characterized by a single-stranded positive RNA genome. Compared with CA16, EV71 often causes aseptic meningitis, encephalomyelitis, and acute flaccid paralysis, and even death [1, 2] . Generally, viruses can only survive in host cells, so it is difficult to develop effective drugs specifically against viruses without the damage on host cells. Currently, several kinds of drugs including interferons, antiviral chemicals, and vaccines have been developed to treat EV71 infection. However, the treatment efficacy of these developed drugs for EV71 infection is still not confirmed yet [3] .",

Resveratrol and polydatin (piceid), the major active components in P. cuspidatum, are confirmed to have pharmacological actions in cardiovascular protection, neuroprotection, anti-inflammation, immunoregulation, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, and liver and lung protection [4] . Moreover, resveratrol reveals inhibitory activity on a wide variety of viruses including HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus), HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus), HSV-2, VZV (varicella-zoster virus) and HCMV (human cytomegalovirus), suggesting that this chemical agent can interfere with infection by altering signal pathways in cells rather than acting directly against the virus itself [5] [6] [7] [8] . Polydatin is the most abundant form of resveratrol in nature, and can be extracted from grapes, peanuts, hop cones, red wine and chocolate products as well as many daily diets [9] . Previous studies have demonstrated that polydatin has many physiological properties such as anti-platelet aggregation, antioxidant activity of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and immune-regulating functions [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .

The results demonstrated that resveratrol could effectively protect from EV71-infected RD cells and inhibit EV71 replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.

However, polydatin was found to have weak inhibitory activity on EV71. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Thermo Scientific HyClone (UT, USA). Hybond C membrane and ECL Western blot detection system were purchased from Pierce Company (Rockford, IL, USA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IKK\u03b1, p-IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, p-IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b3, p-IKK\u03b3, IKB\u03b1, p-IKB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p50, p-NF-\u03baB p50, NF-\u03baB p65, p-NF-\u03baB p65, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from SAB Company (Pearland, TX, USA). Antibodies against anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were obtained from ProteinTECH Group (Chicago, IL, USA).

However, it is still unknown whether polydatin and resveratrol have the antiviral effect on EV71. Our studies have confirmed no cytotoxicity of polydatin and resveratrol on RD cells at doses of 200 and 31.25 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Meanwhile, the IC 50 of polydatin and resveratrol are 979.66 and 21.36 \u03bcg/ml. Ribavirin is a guanosine (ribonucleic) analog and nucleoside inhibitor used to terminate the synthesis of viral RNA and the capping of viral mRNA [37, 38] , indicating that both resveratrol and ribavirin can significantly inhibit the CPE caused by EV71. Although polydatin has been proved to elicit numerous biological effects through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties through up-regulating the expression of glioma-associated oncogene homolog1 (Gli1), Patched-1 (Ptch1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), as well as down-regulating the expression of NF-\u03baB [39] , its antiviral effect on EV71 replication has been validated to be weak Western blot analyses of cell lysates from RD cells pre-incubated with or without resveratrol (30 \u03bcg/mL) for 1.5 h, and then infected with EV71 (MOI = 2) at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h p.i. were conducted using antibodies against the total or phosphorylated IKK\u03b1 (A and B) , IKK\u03b2 (C and D), and IKK\u03b3 (E and F), and using GAPDH as the control.

When resveratrol (30 \u03bcg/ml) and ribavirin (125 \u03bcg/ml) were added simultaneously with or after EV71 absorption for 1.5 h, the viral titers in cell supernatant revealed a decreasing trend, suggesting that resveratrol may block EV71 replication in RD cells, but independent of viral attachment and penetration. EV71 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus encoding four capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and seven nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, VPg, 3C, and 3D) [40] . In addition to protecting viral RNA from nuclease cleavage, the capsid proteins such as VP1, VP2, and VP3 are antigenic protein, and can recognize the receptors on the surface of specific host cells [41, 42] . In this study, the protein synthesis of VP1 significantly increased in EV71-infected RD cells at 8, 12 and 24 h p.i., respectively. On the other hand, EV71/ VP1 was distinctly reduced in the presence of resveratrol. These results indicated that resveratrol could severely impair EV71 replication and mitigate RD cell damage. Further investigations are required to elucidate the effect and mechanism of resveratrol on EV71 infection.",

            "text": "To date, five proteins belonging to the NF-\u03baB family have been identified in mammalian cells: NF-\u03baB1 (p50), NF-\u03baB2 (p52), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel. In the resting condition, the NF-\u03baB p50/p65 heterodimer is in an inactive state in the cytoplasm and binds to the inhibitory molecule I\u03baB\u03b1 (inhibitor of NF-\u03baB). After the stimuli of bacterial and viral infections, the upstream IKK complex including IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3 can phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1 to result in its release from NF-\u03baB and degradation via ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In recent years, resveratrol has been extensively explored, and demonstrated its role in the regulation of crucial cellular processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis and inflammatory responses [43] [44] [45] . In our study, EV71 infection gradually activated the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3, then IKB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p50 and NF-\u03baB p65 were phosphorylated in turn. Subsequently, NF-\u03baB might translocate into the nucleus to bind the promoters of target genes and accelerate the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. On the other hand, the level of IL-2 did not reveal the change in EV71-infected RD cells. Subjected to the pretreatment of resveratrol, the phosphorylation of IKKs/NF-kB pathway molecules could be significantly inhibited, while the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 revealed the reduction in EV71-infected RD cells. According to previous reports, resveratrol is involved in the regulation of many signal pathways such as the pathways of NF-\u03baB, EGFR and SIRT1 activation for antiviral defense in different cells [8, 46, 47] . The activation of NF-\u03baB signal pathway may be efficient for viral replication, such as EV71, influenza A virus and HSV-1.",

Moreover, these anti-viral interventions display certain protective or therapeutic effects when given either before or after EV71 infection that include the reductions in morbidity, mortality, tissue virusloads and the alleviation of lesions. Although resveratrol has little cytotoxicity and shows the inhibitory effect on EV71 replication in vitro, the efficiency should be further evaluated on animal models in the follow-up study. In addition, resveratrol can be rapidly metabolized to glucuronide or sulfate compounds with low bioavailability on first pass after oral administration, which seems to be difficult in clinical application. Therefore, resveratrol may serve as a lead for chemical modification and a suitably modified analogue as a clinical candidate.",
