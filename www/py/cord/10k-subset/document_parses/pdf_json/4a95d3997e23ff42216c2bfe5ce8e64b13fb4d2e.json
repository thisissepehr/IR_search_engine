The first requires the interaction of endotoxin with naturally occurring antibodies to gram negative bacteria, This chain of events initiates activation of all components of complement pathways .8 This complement activation occur in an uncontrolled fashion throughout the vascular space and the resulting active complement components are able to exert their physiological roles i e., platelet aggregation, increase m vascular permeability, activation of neutrophils with chemotactic migration and smooth muscle contraction. These events lead to toxic changes in the micro-circulation, tissue hypoxia, and metabolic acidosis. McCabe studied serum complement levels in bacteremia due to gram negative organismsP In the 41 patients with uncomplicated bacteremia the mean C3 levels (1515:51 mg/100ml) did not differ from the values in controls, however, a significant reduction in complement levels was observed in 26 patients with shock (105+31) and in the 19 patients who had a fatal outcome (984-38). McCabe concluded that the frequency of occurrence of shock or fatal outcome tended to parallel the degree of decrease ot r complement levels in serum specimens obtained shortly after the onset of baeteremia. Fenton and Strunk reported depressed levels of CH50, C3, C4, and factor B in three newborn infants with Group B streptococcal sepsis. 6 They demonstrated that in infants infected with Group B Streptococcus both alternative and direct complement pathways were activated, the complement and hematologic data and the Clinical course of these infants suggested lhat Group B Streptococcus has endotoxin-like properties which may explain the high mortality despite the prompt antibiotic therapy, e C. Activation of kallikrein and kinin system: Plasma kinins are biologicaly active peptides and are capable of a variety of physiologic events i. e, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle relaxation, and hypotension, kinins are generally found in inactive precursors in certain cells and in the circulation. Kinins are activated by endotoxin through the intermediary effect of kallikrein as well as through the intermediation of natural antibody. 10 Thus kininis have a crucial role in the failure of micro-circulation resulting in tissue hypoxia and intractable metabolic acidosis.",

The use of a massive dose of glucocorticoid in endotoxemic shock remains controversial, ix Some controlled clinical studies have shown favorable effects of massive doses of corticosteroids on morbidity and mortality in septic shock while many others have not. ti It is speculated that the syndrome of septic shock represents the combined effects of several of the inflammatory systems already rally activated. Sheagren believes that therapy directed at inhibiting these systems at a very early stage may result in a significant decrease in mortality. 11 In septic shock various inflammatory processes, which are responsible for the body's defence against the microorganism, when activated results in shock producing inflammatory intravascular sequelae of bacteremia. Thus, the well-known adverse effects of glucocorticoids on tissue may be able to ameliorate the process and prevent the development of shock. 11 Complement pathways leading to endothelial cell damage are inhibited by high concentrations of steroids, aa' 14 Sibbald, et al recently demonstrated a decrease in capillary leakage after a large dose of glucocorticoids, is The patients who did not respond to glucocorticoids had leaky capillaries before the dose was adminitered, indicating that steroids can only influence the course if given in large doses early in the stage.",
