When expressed from cDNA in COS cells, wild-type HPC-1 was localized in the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane. Truncation of the hydrophobic domain resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of the mutant, thus indicating that the domain indeed functions as a membrane anchor. A fusion protein with the C-terminal glycosylation sites was glycosylated in transfected cells, providing evidence that HPC-1 has a transmembrane structure, and that the protein is first inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to the plasma membrane. A chimeric protein consisting of Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein with the last 24 amino acids of HPC-1 was inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum in a transmembrane topology and localized along the exocytic pathway of transfected cells similar to HPC-1. These results indicate that the portion is important for intracellular localization of HPC-1.",

In addition to these ER enzymes, tail-anchored proteins exist along the exocytic pathway (25) . For example, HPC-l/syntaxin 1A (HPC-1), a 34-kDa protein with a hydrophobic sequence at its C terminus (26, 17) , has been shown to be located in synaptic vesicles or chromanin granules (28) in addition to the plasma membrane {19). This protein has been shown to play an important role in the docking or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic active zone {20, 21) and of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane {22- 24) . Recent studies have provided insight into the mechanisms underlying the formation, regulation, and function of the membrane protein complex composed of two tail-anchored proteins, this protein and synaptobrevin, and this protein and a lipid-anchored protein, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP- 25) , in transport vesicle targeting {20, 25, 26) . However, little is known about the membrane topology of the C terminus or the targeting sequence of HPC-1 to the plasma membrane. Here, we show that the hydrophobic domain of HPC-1 spans the phospholipid bilayer and functions as a membrane anchor. In addition, we show that the Cterminal portion of HPC-1 is important not only for insertion into the ER membrane, but also for localization to the plasma membrane.",

To determine the role of the hydrophobic domain in membrane anchoring, wildtype and truncated forms of HPC-1 ( Fig. 1 A) were expressed transiently in COS cells under the control of the y?-actin promotor and Rous sarcoma enhancer in the pMIW expression vector (29) . We first confirmed that wild-type HPC-1 was expressed in the total homogenate of the transfected cells with an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa by immunoblotting using anti-HPC-1 antibodies. On the other hand, no cross-reactive protein with the apparent size of 34 kDa was detected in untransfected COS cells (data not shown), indicating the absence of endogenous HPC-1. We then analyzed subcellular localization of the expressed proteins. In this case, the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 88,000 X g for 80 min to separate the membrane fraction from the cytosol fraction. Immunoblotting revealed that wild-type HPC-1 was recovered exclusively in the membrane fraction (Fig. IB, lanes 1 and  2) . Additionally, HPC-1 in the membrane fraction was resistant to alkali extraction (lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the protein is an integral membrane protein. In contrast, a truncated mutant, HPC-1J266-288, was found in the soluble fraction (lanes 5 and 6).",

After a 5-h chase in the presence of cycloheximide, the Golgi staining of HPC-1 (Fig. 3B) became extremely weak as compared with that before the chase (Fig. 3A) . After a 10-h chase, the Golgi labeling disappeared and HPC-1 was concentrated at the plasma membrane (Fig.  3C) . These results support the above idea that HPC-1 is transported to its final destination via the Golgi complex. Next, we attempted to define the membrane topology and the membrane integration site of HPC-1. For these purposes, we fused the N-terminal region of bovine opsin (the OP3 extension), which contains two AT-glycosylation sites, to the C terminus of HPC-1. Asn292 and Asn305 of the chimera (HPC-1/OP3) correspond to Asn2 and Asnl5 of bovine opsin (31), respectively (Fig. 4A) . First, we confirmed that the chimera was recovered in the membrane fraction upon subcellular fractionation and exhibited a similar staining pattern to that of wild-type HPC-1 on indirect immunofiuorescence microscopy (data not shown).",

We then analyzed whether or not the chimera is glycosylated in transfected COS cells. The transfected cells were pulselabeled for 30 min with [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine, chased for 3 h, then the chimera was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against HPC-1. As shown in Fig. 4B (lane 1) , two products were immunoprecipitated. Upon endo H treatment, the upper band disappeared (Fig. 4B, lane 2) , demonstrating that the upper product is glycosylated. Together with cycloheximide block experiments, these suggest that HPC-1/OP3 is first inserted into the ER and transported to the plasma membrane via the exocytic pathway. The endo H sensitivity of glycosylated HPC-1/OP3, however, was not consistent with the plasma membrane localization observed on immunofiuorescence microscopy. One possible interpretation is that newly synthesized HPC-1/OP3 is not processed to an endo H-resistant form with Golgi processing enzymes. An alternative possibility is that HPC-1/OP3 is retained in the ER even after the chase time because of extremely slow transport from the ER. To check these possibilities, metabolic labeling was performed in the presence of BFA, which effectively blocks membrane transport out of the ER (33) and also causes redistribution of Golgi enzymes into the ER (34) . Upon treatment of the transfected cells with BFA, the chimera remained sensitive to endo H (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4) . Therefore, it is suggested that the carbohydrate structure of HPC-1/OP3 is not processed to the endo H-resistant form in spite of its transport from the ER to the plasma membrane.",

In the previous study, we revealed the transmembrane topology of msALDH, a tail-anchored ER protein, using the same strategy, or the N-glycosylation of ALDH/0P3 containing the same 0P3 extension at the C terminus of msALDH {11). Additionally, ALDH/0P3 was localized to the ER and formed the crystalloid ER in transfected COS cells similar to msALDH {11), indicating that the OP3 extension has no effect on intracellular localization of the chimera. By taking advantage of the iV-glycosylation of HPC-1/0P3, we have shown that the hydrophobic domain of HPC-1 spans the ER membrane. This result is consistent with a three-dimensional model of HPC-1 recently obtained by Sato and Akagawa. They constructed the model based on the deduced amino acid and the known biochemical information by utilizing a special software (Discover, Homology, Molecular Simulation) and an INDIGO 2 work station. The calculating system has shown that the C terminus of HPC-1 could transverse the phospholipid bilayer (Sato, C. and Akagawa, K., manuscript in preparation). Thus, our result together with this model supports the transmembrane topology of HPC-1. These results as well as those reported for microsomal cytochrome hi {13) and synaptobrevin {35) suggest that the C termini of most tail-anchored proteins exhibit a lumenal orientation regardless of their intracellular localization.",

The experiments with cycloheximide demonstrated that HPC-1 localized in the Golgi complex can be chased away. In addition, we have recently shown using an in vitro system that HPC-1/0P3 is post-translationally integrated into rough microsomes from dog pancreas and glycosylated (Masaki, R. et al., unpublished observation). Taken together, it is suggested that HPC-1 is post-translationally inserted into the ER and then transported to the plasma membrane via the exocytic pathway. However, the carbohydrate structure of HPC-1/0P3 remained endo Hsensitive, which is inconsistent with its intracellular localization. To find the cause of this discrepancy, we treated transfected COS cells with BFA, which effectively blocks membrane transport out of the ER {33) and also causes redistribution of Golgi enzymes into the ER (34). BFA did not change the endo H sensitivity of HPC-1/OP3. On the contrary, the carbohydrate chain of ALDH/0P3 was processed to an endo H-resistant form as a result of BFA treatment {11). This result indicates that the carbohydrate structure of the 0P3 extension can be further processed by Golgi processing enzymes. Therefore, it seems that conformational changes in the glycosylation site of HPC-1/OP3 after N-glycosylation would result in inhibition of further processing with Golgi enzymes. There are several examples of glycoproteins which contain high mannose oligosaccharides in spite of passage through the Golgi complex. It has been shown that the cell surface transferrin receptor contains both complex and high mannose oligosaccharides (36) . HSP47, a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, is retained in the ER via the C-terminal Arg-Asp-Glu-Leu (RDEL) sequence and has a high mannose oligosaccharide. Although mutated HSP47, which is devoid of the RDEL sequence, is secreted by transfected cells, the secreted mutant possesses an endo H-sensitive carbohydrate structure {37).",

            "text": "The intracellular transport route of HPC-1 is consistent with the current idea that tail-anchored proteins localized along the exocytic pathway are first inserted into the ER membrane in a post-translational manner and transported to their final destinations. For example, synaptobrevin in neuroendocrine cells is transported through the Golgi complex to synaptic vesicles after insertion into the ER membrane in a signal recognition particle-and Sec61pindependent fashion {35). Similarly, tail-anchored ER proteins such as msALDH {10, 11) and microsomal cytochrome bs {12, 13) are inserted into the ER post-translationally and retained in the ER. In the previous study, we showed that two hydrophilic sequences on both sides of the transmembrane domain of msALDH (see Fig. 5A ) play an important role in ER targeting {10) and that the protein is retained in the ER by blockading exit from the ER {11). As for microsomal cytochrome bi, the last 10 amino acids, which include the hydrophilic tail of this protein, are important for its targeting to the ER {12). In addition, the membrane-spanning domain of microsomal cytochrome 65 functions as an ER-retention signal {38). Therefore, there must be targeting or retention sequences in tail-anchored proteins to ensure their correct intracellular localization.",

Since HPC-1 is first inserted into the ER membrane, this may indicate that the portion contains the ER-targeting sequence. As for MBPALDH chimeras, we have confirmed here that the ER-targeting sequences on both sides of the membrane-anchoring domain are necessary for targeting of MBP to the ER. Thus, it appears that HPC-1 belongs to a different class than msALDH with respect to the ER-targeting sequence. Two MBP chimeras behaved totally differently after integration into the ER. MBPALDH (35) was retained in the ER, while MBPHPC-1(24) exited from the ER to the plasma membrane. Recently, Pedrazzini et al. reported that the short transmembrane domain (17 amino acids) of microsomal cytochrome 65 plays an important role in its ER retention by demonstrating the relocation of a mutant cytochrome 65 with a lengthened membrane anchor (22 amino acids) to the plasma membrane {38). This would be the case for the two MBP chimeras, since the transmembrane domains of MBPALDH (35) and MBPHCP-1(24) are composed of 17 and 23 amino acids, respectively. The short transmembrane domain of MBPALDH(35) seems to be important for its ER residency, while the longer transmembrane domain of MBPHPC-1(24) would result in the escape of the chimera from the ER. These may indicate that the transmembrane domains of tail-anchored proteins possess targeting and/or retention sequences similar to membrane proteins synthesized in the signal recognition particledependent manner {2, [7] [8] [9] .",
