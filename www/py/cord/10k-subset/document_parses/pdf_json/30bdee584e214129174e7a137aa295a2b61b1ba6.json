A total of 180 patients with a recent ARDS diagnosis (from 7 to 28 days following onset) were randomized to receive either 2 mg/kg per day of methylprednisolone or placebo for 25 days. The GCs were withdrawn after 2-4 days. The primary endpoint was mortality at day 60. Secondary endpoint included days free from mechanical ventilation, changes in biochemical markers, and the number of infectious complications. No differences in death rates at day 60 (29% in both groups) or day 180 (32% in both) were observed. However, the treatment group required fewer days of mechanical ventilation (7 vs. 11 days, p < 0.001) and fewer days in the ICU (6 vs. 9 days, p = 0.006) during the first 28 days, as well as fewer days of shock, better oxygenation, and better lung mechanics. Treatment was also associated with a reduction in nosocomial infections without an increase in muscular weakness. Post hoc analysis showed higher death rates at day 60 and 180 for the 48 patients in whom GC treatment was initiated 13 or more days after the onset of ARDS. Another post hoc analysis evaluated the levels of type III procollagen peptide in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken from 91 patients during their admission. In these patients, the authors found that in the 46 patients with the lowest peptide values (<50th percentile)-a group that included most of the patients treated after day 13-mortality at day 60 was higher for patients in the treatment group (23 cases) compared to the placebo group (35% vs. 8%, p = 0.03). Conversely, in the 45 patients with the highest peptide values (>50th percentile), mortality at day 60 was lower in the treatment group (23 cases) than the placebo group (4% vs. 19%, p = 0.10). The authors concluded that the evidence did not support the use of methylprednisolone for persistent ARDS, despite the observed improvement in cardiopulmonary physiology. Moreover, they noted that mortality rates may actually increase when GC treatment is initiated more than 13 days after ARDS onset. Among the more notable limitations of the ARDS Network study is the early termination due to low enrollment (only 180 patients from 25 hospitals were included in a 6-year period). Likewise, a high percentage of patients in the treatment group required reintubation (20 vs. 6; p = 0.008). It has been hypothesized that this outcome could be explained by the abrupt discontinuation of the GC treatment, which may lead to renewed pulmonary inflammation (the mechanisms by which abrupt discontinuation can be harmful are discussed in more detail below).

Much confusion persists in terms of the action of GCs with respect to the type of molecule used (either hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone) and the dose (low or moderate). In septic shock, perhaps it is best to use molecules with a mineralocorticoid and GC effect at doses that replace the adrenal insufficiency, while in ARDS, perhaps it would be better to use molecules whose effect is purely GC at antiinflammatory doses ( Table 2 ). In addition, we must determine when to initiate GC treatment with respect to ARDS onset (preventative, early, or late), the delivery method (intermittent bolus or continuous perfusion), treatment duration (short or prolonged), and the appropriate discontinuation method (abrupt or progressive).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 238, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 669, "end": 676, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Treatment strategies"}, {"text": "The future development of new, selective GCs that mimic the beneficial effects of natural GCs without their detrimental side effects seems likely.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment strategies"}, {"text": "The efficacy of GCs in alleviating inflammatory disorders is due to the different actions of the glucocorticoid receptor on multiple signaling pathways.
