The genomic RNA contains four open reading frames (ORFs). The largest ORF 2 encodes a polyprotein of 947 amino acids (103.6 kDa), which codes for a serine protease and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The viral coat protein is encoded on ORF 4 present at the 3-proximal region. Other ORFs 1 and 3 encode the predicted 14.6 kDa and 19.8 kDa proteins of unknown function. The consensus signal for frameshifting, heptanucleotide UUUAAAC and a stem-loop structure just downstream is in front of the AUG codon of ORF 3. Analysis of the in uitro translation products of RGMoV RNA suggests that the 68 kDa protein may represent a fusion protein of ORF 2-ORF 3 produced by frameshifting. The protease region of the polyprotein and coat protein have a low similarity with that of the sobemoviruses (approximately 25% amino acid identity), while the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region has particularly strong similarity (54 to 60% of more than 350 amino acid residues).
