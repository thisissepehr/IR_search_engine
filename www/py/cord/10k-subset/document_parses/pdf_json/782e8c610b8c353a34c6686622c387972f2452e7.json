            "text": "The authors have isolated and characterized a novel serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)-like gene in marine Emiliania huxleyi virus (EhV-99B1). The open-reading frame (ORF) of EhV99B1-SPT encoded a protein of 496 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 96 kDa and Ip 6.01. The results of sequence analysis showed that there was about 31%-45% identity in amino acid sequence with other organisms. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree suggested that the EhV99B1-SPT gene possibly horizontally transferred from the eukaryote. Hydrophobic profiles of deduced amino acid sequences suggested a hydrophobic, globular and membrane-associated protein with five transmembrane domains (TMDs) motifs. Several potential N-linked glycosylation sites were presented in SPT. These results suggested that EhV99B1-SPT was an integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein. Despite lower sequence identity, the secondary and three-dimensional structures predicted showed that the \"pocket\" structure element composed of 2\u03b1-helices and 4\u03b2sheets was the catalytic center of this enzyme, with a typical conserved \"TFTKSFG\" active site in the N-terminal region and was very close to those of prokaryotic organisms. However, the N-terminal domain of EhV99B1-SPT most closely resembled the LCB2 catalysis subunit and the C-terminal domain most closely resembled the LCB1 regulatory subunit of other organisms which together formed a spherical molecule. This \"chimera\" was highly similar to the prokaryotic homologous SPT. For a functional identification, the EhV99B1-LCB2 subunit gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, which resulted in significant accumulation of new sphingolipid in E. coli cells.",

SPT condenses serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine. SPT is present in animals, higher plants, and fungi, as well as in prokaryotes (Ikushiro et al., 2001; Nagiec et al., 1994; Weiss et al., 1997) . These SPT homologies are distinct from each other in their structure, but they are conservative functionally (Salzmann et al., 2000) . Prokaryotic SPTs are homodimer containing two symmetric subunits (Ikushiro et al., 2001) , whereas eukaryotic SPTs are heterodimer comprised of LCB1 and LCB2 subunits (Buede et al., 1991) . SPT belongs to the small conserved enzyme family called the \u03b1-oxoamine synthases (AOS). AOS has a conserved TFTKSFGSVG motif inducing the combination of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) with an \u03b1-amino acid to form a compound called a Schiff base (Ikushiro et al., 2001) .",

When subjected to grazing or during viral infection, E. huxleyi produces dimethylsulfonio propionate (DMSP), the precursor of dimethyl sulphide (DMS), which is linked to marine cloud formation and even climate regulation (Charlson et al., 1987; Iglesias-Rodriguez et al., 2008; Stefels et al., 2007) .",

It is now generally accepted that the E. huxleyi virus (EhV) contributes to the collapse of these blooms (Bratbak et al., 1993) . Virus-mediated mortality of E. huxleyi is thought to play an important role in ocean biogeochemistry now. E. huxleyi virus 86(EhV-86) was originally isolated from the demise of an E. huxleyi bloom off the coast of England (Wilson et al., 2002) . Now, more than ten such viruses have been isolated (Bratbak et al., 1993; Wilson et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2005) . Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA polymerase genes of these viruses suggests that EhV belongs to a new genus within the family of Phycodnaviridae-Coccolithovirus (Allen et al., 2006; Bratbak et al., 1993; Larsen et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2005) .

These genes are predicted to encode a vast array of functional proteins involved in sugar metabolism, sphingolipid biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and signaling pathway (Bidle et al., 2011; Monier et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2005) . EhV-86 especially has some unusual CDSs, including seven genes encoding sphingolipid synthesis enzymes (Monier et al., 2009) . This biosynthetic pathway appears to function during lytic infection and programmed cell death (PCD) with corresponding activation of an algal metacaspase, an essential activity for EhV replication. Therefore, it changed the ecological niches of the E. huxleyi and turned over the E. huxleyi metabolic pathways for viral replication (Allen et al., 2008; Rohwer et al., 2009) . The sequencing of the EhV-86 genome revealed a gene predicted to encode SPT, which has never been identified in a virus (Wilson et al., 2005) . Moreover, SPT encoded by the EhV-86 genome not only contributes to regulating sphingolipid levels in E. huxleyi cells but also exhibits a unique substrate preference to produce novel ceramide (Jermy, 2010) . Ceramide-induced PCD has been observed in E. huxleyi cells during virus infection (Bidle et al., 2004; Jermy, 2010) . This gene was expressed in yeast and was thought to rescue yeast LCB1 and LCB2 mutants (Han et al., 2006) . Undoubtedly, SPT gene is involved in the interaction between EhV strains and their hosts, as yet, their precise role remains unknown (Michaelson et al., 2010; .",

This 3D structure was highly similar to other members of the AOS family (such as 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase, 5-aminolevulinate synthase and 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzym) (data not shown). The central motif, TFTKSFG was composed of two \u03b1-helices and four \u03b2-Strands (\"pocket\"). The EhV99B1-LCB2 carried a lys 307 residue and EhV99B1-LCB1 carried a cys 535 residue expected to form a Schiff base with PLP. The His 197, Ala 198 and Ser 199 residues were involved in cofactor binding (Figs 4 and 5).",

Our research also supports this result and shows that 12 EhV isolates were relatively small genetic variations and closely related evolutionary relationships. However, it is limited for determining evolutionary relationships between coccolithovirus and other members of Phycodnaviridae families by using single gene for phylogeny analysis. Three groups of proteins (such as ehv 030, 072, 085, 104, 128, 141, 438 and 459 belonging to Group I and further other genes belonging to Groups II and III) from members of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) were concatenated for phylogenetic analysis and it showed that Phycodnaviridae (including coccolithovirus) most likely diverged from the common ancestral NCLDVs (Allen et al., 2006) . Since SPT has never been identified in Phycodnaviridae before Coccolithoviridae, SPT gene loss within the Phycodnaviridae families is thought to contribute to the divergence between Coccolithoviridae and other members of Phycodnaviridae families (Allen et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "Coccolithovirida as a reservoir of genetic diversity could move host-derived genetic material from one organism to another, even from one ecosystem to another (Rohwer et al., 2009) . It is called \"horizontal gene transfer\". It has been documented that SPT gene was readily identified in E. huxleyi and EhV genome (Monier et al., 2009 ) and they are likely to share a common \"domain architectures\" which are the presence of a single open reading frame (ORF). The ORF encodes a eukaryotic-like SPT in which its N-terminal domain most closely resembled the LCB2 subunit and the C-terminal domain most closely resembled the LCB1 subunit (Monier et al., 2009 ). Thus, we hypothesized that EhV-SPT might be derived from its host genome. To verify this assume, we constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences of SPT-LCB1 and SPT-LCB2 shared by EhV99B1, E. huxleyi and the widest taxonomic range of homologs available in GenBank (Fig. 7) . In this case, 99% bootstrap values for the LCB1 domain supported clustering of EhV-99B1 and E. huxleyi protein sequences. Curiously, both LCB2 of EhV-99B1 and E. huxleyi shared only 46% identity. It is difficult to illustrate that a deep phylogenetic origin between EhV99B1-SPT and E. huxleyi-SPT within eukaryotes. We hypothesized that EhV99B1-SPT was not directly derived from E. huxleyi, and was horizontally transferred between virus and eukaryote or its host (simultaneity or individually), ultimately leading to form E. huxleyi-SPT and EhV99B1-SPT, respectively. EhV99B1-SPT was predicted to be an integral membrane protein. This is supported by one study showing that recombinant EhV86-SPT is a membraneassociated protein (Han et al., 2006) . It has shown that ceramide has been obtained from plasmalemma (such as cytomembrane, microsome and endoplasmic reticulum) (Hannun et al., 2001) . As a result, it could be concluded that EhV99B1-SPT is more likely to be resided in plasmalemma. Moreover, several potential N-linked glycosylation sites were presented in EhV99B1-LCB2. These results suggest that SPT was localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, subcellular localization prediction suggests that EhV99B1-LCB1 resided in cytoplasm. These seemingly contradictory results are possibly true, because these results were consistent with previous studies on the LCB1 of mammalian SPT which was proved to localize in cytoplasm (Yasuda et al., 2003) and the LCB2 of Arabidopsis SPT and yeast SPT was in the ER (Tamura et al., 2001; Han et al., 2004) . It is known that eukaryotic SPTs are membrane bound and the active site facing the cytoplasm (Futerman et al., 2005) . It is presumed to be an ER multimeric protein that its one subunit extended through the cytoplasm and was contiguous with TMD. As evidence aliunde, the substrates of SPT, serine and palmitoyl-CoA, with cytoplasmic localizationcan move between cytoplasm and Golgi though vesicular transport (Han et al., 2004) . Thus, we hypothesized that the C-terminus of EhV99B1-SPT was the binding site of substrates and the catalytic center of the N-terminus of EhV99B1-SPT interact with the cytoplasm, as well as within the lumenal of ER. This \"conjugated heterodimer-like enzyme\" employs a pump to drive sphingolipid from cytoplasm to endoplasmic reticulum. This process would play an important role in subcellular infection dynamics. EhV99B1-LCB2 most closely resembles catalytic subunit. Two lines of evidence support this view: first, mutation of the EhV86-LCB2 was found to inactivate this enzyme (Han et al., 2006) ; second, our study has shown that recombinant EhV99B1-LCB2 was capable of forming new sphingoid bases and encoded an active catalytic subunit. In addition, it has been shown that EhV86-SPT exhibits a unique substrate preference to de novo synthesized novel ceramide or GSL (Jermy, 2010; Kolesnick et al., 2000) . Recombinant EhV99B1-LCB2 was capable of producing sphingoid bases, which have never been identified in E. coil before. It suggests that recombinant EhV99B1-LCB2 is functionally similar to recombinant EhV86-SPT without co-expressing with EhV99B1-LCB1.These results have indicated that EhV-SPT as single-chain fusion proteins are novel enzymatically active in prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression system. It can be concluded that native EhV-LCB2 may be involved in infection process. However, mutations in the human SPTLC1 gene (LCB1) could cause decreased activity, leading to hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (Bejaoui et al., 2001; Gable et al., 2010) and the human Lcb1p at 180 cysteine is in a potential active site for N-myristoylation and membrane association of SPT (Gable et al., 2002) . This site can also be found in EhV99B1-LCB1. It could be concluded that the EhV99B1-LCB1 had the similar function with SPTLC1 gene. Indeed, EhV99B1-LCB1 most closely resembles regulatory subunit. In addition, it has shown that Tsc3p or ssSPT, these small subunits are required for optimal SPT activity in yeast or mammalian and do not seem to have effects on EhV86-SPT (Gable et al., 2000; Han et al., 2009) . However, it is unknown whether EhV99B1 contains one gene like Tsc3p or ssSPT throughout the genome. If these putative genes are present, EhV99B1-SPT would be dependent on them for intact activity. Thus, this intriguing domain architecture of EhV99B1-SPT was probably one way to allow viruses to manipulate and contribute to the synthesis of ceramide, and this process eventually causes the host cell to die.",

It indicats that there could exist potential relationship between viral and host genes, and this host-virus interaction is one of the features of co-evolutionary strategy, which is called \"Red Queen\" hypothesis in action. It argues for an intense \"arms race\" between viruses, trying to turn over host apoptotic pathway for replication and proliferation of itself, and host, trying to trigger apoptotic pathway to avoid the spread of viruses and colony collapse. In this process, SPT encoded by EhV exhibits a unique substrate preference to de novo synthesized novel ceramide or GSL (Jermy, 2010; Kolesnick et al., 2000) . These viral ceramide or GSL are distinct from host-specific ceramide or GSL involving in the intraand intercellular signal transduction apoptosis pathways in E. huxleyi. Clearly, EhV-SPT plays an obvious role in this co-evolutionary strategy.",

            "text": "Natural mortality of phytoplankton induced by virus has been recognized as an important factor that caused the loss of marine microalgae, especially in ecological dynamics between EhV and E. huxleyi (Liu et al., 2009 ). EhV99B1-SPT implicates in the regulation of apoptosis that plays important roles in bloom dynamics of E. huxleyi. It has been demonstrated that E. huxleyi displayed apoptosis characteristics of morphology and biochemistry during EhV infection (Bidle et al., 2011) . However, it is unknown whether the expression of EhV99B1-SPT activated or inhibited the process of apoptosis in E. huxleyi. One study suggests that ceramide prevents PCD induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation (Ito et al., 1995) . EhV99B1-SPT also was thought to take over the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in host and can be termed the viral shunt (Wilhelm et al., 1999) . However, Sequence analysis of this viral genome has shown that it lacks a critical enzyme (3-ketosphinganine reductase) for sphingolipid biosynthetic activity. An unusual glucosylceramide from E. huxleyi infected with EhV was isolated, implicating sphingolipids in the lysis of this alga. It suggests that the novel sphingolipids are not the only product of viral genomes, because EhV-encoded genes contain only a subset of the activities (such as dihydroceramide synthase, fatty acid desaturase, lipid phosphate phosphatase, transmembrane fatty acid elongation protein, sterol desaturase, fatty acid desaturase) required to generate the novel sphingolipid, implying that its synthesis is the result of coordinated interactions between algal-and viralencoded biosynthetic enzymes. The 3-ketosphinganine reductase is dispersed in the E. huxleyi genome, which does not encode any obvious homologs for transmembrane fatty acid elongation protein and sterol desaturase. It suggests the metabolic complementation of EhV99B1 with its host in the entire sphingolipid synthesis pathway. This complementation and expression of EhV-SPT lead to de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway (SBP) . De novo fatty acid may play an important role in an enveloped virus release, intra-and intercellular signal transduction pathways and host apoptosis (Evans et al., 2009 ). In conclusion, this work contributed to our understanding of the gene composition, evolution and horizontal transfer between marine virus and its host, their ecological significance, as well as host-virus interactions. It can provide important insights into the role of this gene in its native host. The viral-encoded SPT as sufficient novelty and importantly gene storing in DNA library would facilitate gene manipulation and reform in the future. Besides, this suggests that trans-dominant nature of the viral-encoded sphingolipid biosynthetic activities also make the EhV99B1-SPT gene serve as a useful paradigm for metabolic engineering and studies and exploit a novel way for ceramide production in the future.",
