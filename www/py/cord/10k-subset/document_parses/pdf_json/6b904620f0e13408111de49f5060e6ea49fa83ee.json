On this basis of comparison, the biological activity of RASS is approximately two-to three-fold lower than that of FSS for the histopathological findings in the anterior nose and in the larynx at the base of the epiglottis. FSS and RASS are equally active for changes in the larynx at the arytenoid projections when compared on a CO concentration basis. Previous SS inhalation studies with experimental animals have usually been based on the TPM concentration as dose parameter. FSS and RASS were equally active based on TPM concentrations with one exception, i.e., histopathological findings at the arytenoid projections which were more pronounced for RASS than for FSS. The described differences in the biological activity of FSS and RASS may also give some clues as to the mechanism and the SS components which may be involved in inducing such effects: Most of the histopathological changes observed seem to correlate with the TPM concentration. In the larynx, at the base of the epiglottis, this may be interpreted as a consequence of particle impaction on the sites where the inhaled air stream bends. Except for the base of the epiglottis, this correlation with the TPM concentration was not expected. For example, among the gas-phase components of SS analyzed, the aldehydes were described to induce epithelial changes in the nose, in particular acrolein as the most active of the three aldehydes analyzed at their respective dose levels (Feron et al., 1978; Appelman et al., 1986; Woutersen et al., 1987) . Apparently, the concentration of the gas-phase aldehydes was not high enough to substantially impact the SS-related morphological effects at this site. There is only one site where histopathological findings were not seen to depend on the particle concentration, i.e., at the arytenoid projections, namely the vocal cords. No explanation for this is available to date. The data may suggest a dependence on the SS gas phase, but a qualitative change of the paniculate matter by room-aging cannot be excluded either.

This difference is most probably attributable to the involvement of different cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the formation of the five metabolites analyzed.
