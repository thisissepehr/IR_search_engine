This allowed simultaneous acquisition and wheighted scatter correction of the planar images. Matched and mismatched defects between the congruent short axis slices representing perfusion and metabolism were evaluated visually and by segmental ROI analysis. Results.\" Pts with sufficient glucose uptake had an unexpected high spatial resolution in both FDG and MIBI images. 10 of 28 pts (36%) with diagnostic image quality had perfusion/metabolism mismatches indicating hibernating myocardium. 18 of 28 pts showed matched defects indicating scar tissue. Nondiagnostic image quality in 12 pts was due to low glucose uptake and not to technical problems associated with high energy SPECT.",

Regional wall motion, assessed prior to and after CABG by first-pass and ECG gated peffusion imaging with [99mTc]MIBI, stress/rest [99mTc]MIBI and [18F]FDG uptake were scored in 5 segments in each of 14 subjects for a total number of 70 segments. By using as a reference the pre and postoperative wall motion function, the probability of regional wall motion recovery was estimated in relation to the preoperative regional perfusion and metabolic scores by a stepwise multiple logistic analysis. The segments with the highest probability (96%) of recovery from preoperative asynergy after CABG were those with marked [18F]FDG uptake prior to surgery. High probabilities of recovery were also estimated for the asynergic segments presenting with moderate and low [18F]FDG uptake (92% and 79%, respectively). A very low probability of functional recovery (13%) was estimated in the segments with no [18F]FDG uptake. The preoperative [99mTc]MIBI pattern of distribution was, per se, insufficient to estimate the outcome of the CABG in asynergic tissue. The results of the study confirm the paramount importance of the identification of asynergic, yet viable myocardium in the diagnosis of patients undergoing CABG and the suitability of [18F] FDG studies under fasting conditions for this purpose.",

We hypothesized that the change in uptake between exercise and 24 hours delayed images is a reliable marker of viable myocardium. We studied 32 consecutive patients aged 58\u00b19 (mean\u00b1sd), who survived to a first myocardial infarction and were candidates for coronary artery bypass surgery (REV). They were submitted to pre and post operative exercise, 4 and 24 hours redistribution T1 SPECT imaging , rest 2D echo before and every four weeks for four months after REV. From matched 2D and T1 images 144 infarcted segments (IS) were analyzed; we measured regional systolic wall thickening (WT) from 2D echo and the amount of relative T1 uptake in each serial image. 144 IS had abnormal WT pre REV, respectively 75 (52%) and 104 of them (72%) improved WT (>2mm) by month one and three post REV, 40 (28%) remained unchanged. The changes in relative uptake between stress and 24 hours pre REV T1 images (ST1) and in post REV WT (~WT) were determined in all IS. There was a significant relationship (r=0.89, p<0.01) between 6TI and time to improvement of WT, and between the degree of WT improvement and ST1 (r=0.92, p<0.00). Time to WT improvement was \" shorter and its degree was significantly superior in IS with greater ST1. In conclusion this study demonstrates the possibility of myocardial stunning after a REV procedure. Its occurrence and time to recovery is inversely related to the degree of pre REV ~TI. D.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the dependence of this fill in effect on the degree of stenosis and the presence of collaterals. SPECT studies under exercise, redistribution (RD, 4h p.i.) and reinjection (RI, 24h p.i.) conditions were performed on 62 patients with 132 stenotic vessels (50 LAD, 35 LCX, 47 RCA). The left ventricle was divided into 17 segments and for each segment the results of the angiography and scintigraphiy were independently classified by two pairs of observers. From the angiography the degree of narrowing, the segments dependent on this vessel and the degree of collateralization were classified. Further wall motion abnormalities and the myocardinm supplied by each of the main coronary arteries were determined. Based on the scintigraphy all segments were scored according to their perfusion in the stress, RD and RI study. The perfusion score (PS) ranged from 0 to 3. To quantify the fill in effect for each area dependent on a stenotic vessel a fill in index was calculated according to the formula: (~PSRI -ZPSRD)/ZSegm. 41 of the 76 >90% narrowed vessels were collateralized (61%), but only 2 of the 56 <90% narrowed vessels was collateraiized (3.5%) . 39 of the 43 collateralized stenoses showed a fill in effect (91%), but only 3 of the 89 not collateralized (3%). The dependence of fill in effect, collateralization and > 90% stenosis was highly sigrdficant ( XZtest <0.0001). In our patient group only in vessels with a > 90% narrowing there was a benefit from the reinjection study. The fill in effect was closely correlated to the presence of collaterals. In these cases the fill in may be an indication for hibernating myocardium. A multicanter study (SIRT) on relnJsctlon Imaging (RJ-I) after conventional stress-redistribution Imaging (SR-I) is ongoing In Italy to test the Inddenca of discordant results for regional myocardial viability. Nine medical centers, equipped with the same gamma camera and computer software, partecipatad t 9 the protocol. These are preliminary results In 156 pts with Ischemlo heart disease (123 with previous M.I.) and perfuslon defects (PD) alter stress myocardial sclntlgraphy (planar method, visual reading, 15 segments, 5 point scale). Just after the 93 pts were ralnJoctad at rest and RJ-I was performed alter 30 rain (group A). Other 63 pts were ralnjected at rest in a separate day and RJ-I was performed 30 min and 4 h later. There were no significant clinical differences between group A and B with respect to age, sex, M.l., history of angina and ECG stress test results. In group B a more extensive impalremant of regional wall motion was detected by ECHO, performed within 15 days. At least one point difference In segmental score identified reversible (REV) and worsening (WOR) PD at SR-I. Segmental PD with unchanged abnormalities were considered llxed 0RR). Improved (RJ+), unchanged (RJ=) and worsened (R J-) PD were identified alter segmental comparison of RJ-I When comparing the incidence of R J+ versus RJ= plus R J-segments no significant difference was found between the two groups (p = 0A1). A good agreement of segmental scoring was found between 30 rain and 4 h RJ-I In group B (k-statistic = .725). Our results point out to a lesser incidence ol R J+ than previously reported and show that these findings are similar for both RJ procedures adopted.",

Reinjection of a second dose of thallium-201 reduces the underestimation of myocardial viability although the optimal moment of thallium-201 reinjection is still in dispute. We investigated the possibility for detection of viable myocardium after early reinjection according a new protocol. Eighty-one consecutive patients suspected for coronary artery disease were studied after exercise, early reinjection and redistribution. The first dose, 75 MBq thallium-201, was administered at maximal exercise followed by planar imaging in the 3 standard views. A second dose of thallium-201135 MBq) was given immediately after completing the exercise-images. Image-acquisition was repeated after 1 h (early reinjection) and 4 h (redistribution). Each set of thallium-201 images was visually and quantitatively analysed. Sixty-nine patients showed diminished or absent activity in one or more segments (total 233 segments). After early reinjection 34 patients showed fixed defects in 74 segments; in these 34 patients 66 segments persisted at 4 h redistribution, and 8 segments showed filling-in. In 35 patients all defects (83 segments) improved or normalised after early reinjection. Further filling-in at 4 h redistribution of already improved defects was seen in 17 patients (21 segments). However in 16 patients (32 segments) the exercise-defects showed reverse redistribution at 4 h. Although 4 h redistribution imaging may show further filling-in of early reinjection-image defects, it did not improve the detection of myocardial viability in the individual patient. Therefore early reinjection circumvents the need for 4 h redistribution imaging and may become the standard procedure in assessing myocardial viability, being an effective, time-saving and patient-comfortable approach. Several studies have demonstrated that certain labelled free fatty acids might be more accurate markers of viability than T1201 after myocardial infarction (MI) . The aim of this study was to compare myocardial uptake of T1201 after redistribution and restreinjection to that of rest-injected Iodine-123 Methyl-Hexadecanoic acid (IMHA) after MI. A mean of 32 days after MI, 60 patients (53 + 8 years) underwent exercise SPECT T1201 with 4-hour redistribution and 37 MBq rest-reinjecfion, followed by rest SPECT with IMHA (100 to 200 MBq). Results were scored using a 20 segments division of the left ventricle. -Segment analysis : Of a total number of 373 segments with T1201 stress defects, 103 (28%) could be considered viable as evidenced by normal or near-normal uptake on either T1201 redistribution, rest-reinjection or rest IMHA scans. This residual viability was identified after T1201 redistribution in 49 cases (48%), T1201 redistribution or rest-reinjection in 79 (77%) and on IMHA rest scans in 102 (99%). -Patient analysis : When considering the only 16 pts (27%) with mild to important residual ischemia (> 3 segments) on IMHA scans, viability was underestimated on T1201 scans in 8 cases (50%), andextent of underestimation was > 2 segments (range 2 to 4) in 4 of them (25%).",

These 13 patients were all d i a g n o s e d as normal by and no i n t e r v e n t i o n would have been indicated. In this study, we have attempted to evaluate in 44 patients (pts) the diagnostic performance of dobutamine stress tomographic imaging (DST) to detect residual ischaemia (IS.) in the infarcted area or at distance. Four pts presented myocardial infarction (M.I.) in two vessel territories and twenty pts had multiple vessel disease. Data were recorded in the subacute phase of M.I. and compared to dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and to angiography. Fifteen mCi of 99mTc-MIBI were injected at peak infusion of dobutamine (up to 40 mcg.kg/mim) and DST performed 90 min later to allow decrease of background activity. 'M.I. was visualiazed in all pts by both techniques. Myocardial IS. around the infarcted area was detected in 17 cases by DSTand in 20 cases by DSE while absence of IS. was observed in 31 cases with DST and in 28 with DSE (complete agreement in 58% of cases). DST identified multiple vessel disease in 13 pts (sensitivity of 65%) and DSE in 10 pts (sensitivity of 50%). Slight discrepancies were present for 20 pts : IS. in the infarcted zone was detected only by DSE in 13 cases and only by DST in 7 cases. For twelve of them, the angiogram showed the presence of residual stenosis of the infarct related artery.",

Preliminary studies in 8 pts., with recurrent disease, after i.v. injection of )~ detected all 14 tumor sites demonstrated at second-look laparotomy. The percentage of injected dose (%ID), measured by gamma-counter, ranged from 0. .7%ID/gram of tumors (T) and from 0.002 to 0.005% ID/gram of normal tissues (NT) with T/NT ratios as high as 105 fold. In a second group of 5 pts. a double paired protocol was performed coinjecting [3] [4] [5] mCi of 2ip and 0.5-1mCi of F(ab')2 iv, in order to determine which one of the two routes allowed a better tumor localization with elevated % of ID. A total of 15 lesions was correctly identified and in all of them a significant higher concentration of 131I over was measured, ranging from 1.8 to 37 fold in tumors, being equal to 1 in normal biopsies. In a third group of 10 pts RIS was performed by iv administration of 15-21 mCi of 99mTc- to evaluate this kind of radiopharmaceutical could allow a satisfactory localization of tumor-nodules. Using both planar and tomographic images primary tumors (6), peritoneal and omental spreading (9), and pelvic meatastases (4) were correctly detected as early as 6 hours p.i. The T/NT ratios were similar to those measured for iodine labelted preparations. We conclude that Specifically binds to ovarian tumors with levels greater then other MAbs currently used, mainly after ip injection; (b) represents, on the basis of %1I) bound to tumor one of.the best candidate for radioimmunotherapy; and suggests to reevaluate the use of methotrexate in chemotherapy, because of the role of FBP in tumor growth.

In a series of 8 patients with NHL and 1 patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the 1-mg LL2 Fab' labeled with 20-25 mCi 99mTc by a rapid kit resulted in a total of 29/34 (88%) tumor sites disclosed if a single patient with high tumor burden is excluded. Antibody imaging with confirmatory and complementary to gallium 'results, as well 13~ as to targeting with the I-LL2 preparation in these patients. Splenic uptake was confirmed as non-specific, since this was also found in patients with carcinomas.

COLORECTAL C~CER IMAGING WITH : RESULTS OF A MULTICENTER PHASE-III TRIAL. A multicenter trial at 19 U.S. institutions has been completed with an imaging kit consisting of 1 mg of anti-CEA Fab' ( labeled with 20-25 mCi 99mWc by a fast, direct method. Patients (pts) with colorectal cancer were stratified into a group with at least one known tumor of 0.5 cm or larger (120 pts, 114 evaluable), and a second group with no evident disease, but a strong suspicion of recurrence due to a rising CEA, or other clinical signs (57 pts, 54 evaluable). Mean incorporation of the label in the field was 97% by thin-layer chromatography. One pt had a boost in a pre-existing human anti-mouse antibody response to the fragment (ImmuSTRIP\u00ae- HAMA-fragment) . In pts with known disease, by patient, sensitivity was 85% and predictive value of a positive reading was 92%. By lesion, sensitivity was 71% (79% in the liver) and positive predictive value was 89% (95% in the liver). In patients with occult disease, accuracy of the antibody scan has been 60% compared with 51% for conventional techniques, such as X-rays, CT scans or MRI. The increased precision in estimating extent-of-disease contributed to potential improvements in patient management of 27%, 50% and 35%, in known disease, occult disease, and the two groups combi~n~ed, respectively. We conclude that ImmuRAID-CEA[~mTc] is safe, easy-to-use and may contribute to improvements in the management of patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum.

Clinical efficacy data will be presented. One of the major problems in tumor patients is the accurate assessment of tumor infiltration and spread. While methods like CT and MRI provide morphologic information, functional studies of tumor metabolism with PET may help to achieve a more accurate diagnosis. We use a two ring PET system for patient examinations. and/or N-13-glutamate are injected for studies of the tqmor metabolism, while O-15 labeled water is administered to assess the tumor peffusion. Metabolic studies in patients with recurrent colorectal tumors demonstrated, that PET can be used to determine the increased FDG metabolism in the malignant lesions. We were able to differentiate tumor and scar in 28 of 29 tumor patients and 13 patients with his~ tologically proven scar tissue using FDG. The accumulation of N-13-giutamate exceeded the FDC~uptake in the tumor region as well in the normal bowel. The comparison of perfusion and FDG uptake demonstrates, that perfusion measurements in soft tissue lesions are not reliable for the differentiation between benign and malignant masses. Problems existed in patients with inflammation (n-2) due to the increased tracer uptake. PET studies in patients with lung turrets (n-20) showed increased metabolism in malignant tumor and involved lymph nodes. Tumor recurrence after surgery and/or radiation therapy could be differentiated from scar tissue. Furthermore, the measurement of tumor metabolism with FDG or N-13-glutamate proved to be a reliable method for therapy follow up in patients receiving chemotherapy. We were able to show, that changes in tumor metabolism preceeded changes in tumor volume during therapy. was used in patients with liver metastases from colorectal malignancies in order to evaluate the uptake of the cytostatic agent in the lesions and the correlation to therapy outcome. The distribution of the FU metabolite concentrations shows, that 76% of all metastases (34/44) have low tracer concentrations, while 24% have higher concentration values. This rate corresponds to the average response rate of colorectal metastases to chemotherapy, as reported in the literature. We were able to demonstrate a high correlation (r=0.8) between the FU uptake in metastases.prior to therapy and the lesion growth rate during chemotherapy. Furthermore, PET studies with FU were used to compare different treatment protocols (systemic vs. regional application, pretreatment with folinic acid). Our results demonstrate, that PET is a promising tool for both diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic follow up in tumor patients. FU has been used in clinical practice to treat colorectal carcinomas for more than two decades. The average response rate is lower than 20%. Since tumor response to FU chemotherapy necessitates the accumulation of the cytostatic agent in the metastases, PET with F-18 labeled FU can be used to assess the tracer concentration in the target area. We used a PET system to evaluate the FU and its metabolite concentrations in patients with liver metastases prior to FU chemotherapy. The target area corresponds to the largest tumor diameter and was determined by CT shortly before the PET study. F-18 labeled FU was administered together with 500 mg nonlabeled FU in order to obtain therapeutic concentrations. Sequential PET images were acquired for two hours beginning with the FU infusion. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated from the PET cross sections two hours after tracer application. All patients received FU chemotherapy after the PET study. The tumor volume and growth rate were calculated from follow up CT studies and compared to the FU accumulation in the metastases prior to chemotherapy. The preliminary evaluation includes 17 examinations. A correlation coefficient of 0.8 was o1~ tained for thsr~= ~r\" standardized FU.,0~ ~ concentrations and the growth rate of the This investigation was undertake to explore the potential utility of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with 2d Each region of increased FDG accumulation was interpreted as positive for malignancy.

Usually this is provided by tom0graphic methods, especially contrast medium angio-CT. To get direct metabolic information we use 15- 7 GBq) and PETto measure blood flow and energy metabolism of liver metastases:in 12 patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Dynamic acquisitions were performed with a Siemens ECAT 951 as a basis for absolute quantification of blood flow and glucose metabolism. The input functions for the water studies were determined noninvasively in the abdominal aorta using geometrical corrections. A nev~ linearized fit was used to compute absolute blood flow values. The glucose metabolism was derived from a patlak analysis using pseudoarterial blood samples as the input function. Qualitative comparison of FDG and water studies resulted in areas of different types of tracer distribution: The central necrosis with low flow and FDG metabolism, a margin with low flow but normal or increased FDG metabolism and the outer, viable part of the tumor with normal or increased blood flow and FDG metabolism. The use of water as a flow marker underestimated the extent of viable tumor tissue compared to the FDG-scan. In clinical practice FDG is a more reliable.tracer for testing tumor viability. The finding of low flow areas in viable tumor tissue may indicate some difficulties in using contrast medium X-rays for the determination of tumor viability. ",

Conventional bone marrow scintigraphy (BMS) using labeled nanocolloid has the disadvantage of high liver, spleen and background activity. In contrast, preliminary results of bone marrow visualization with the anti-granulocyte antibody BW 250/183 showed significantly better results. We therefore initiated a prospective study to evaluate the clinical value of this antibody compared to lilac crest biopsy. 44 patients (25 females, 19 males, age: 19-76 years) were thus far studied. The diagnoses comprised 26 patients with 8 with Hodgkin's disease, 6 with acute lymphatic leukemia and 4 with plasmocytoma. The scintigrams were conducted as whole body studies and planar regional scans [3] [4] hours p.L of 555 MBq of Tc-99m-labeled anti-granulocyte-antibody. The marrow biopsy from the posterior sacro-iliac joint was conducted within 3 weeks following scintigraphy. 18 patients showed normal findings in both the scintigraphy and the biopsy. In 26 patients bone marrow involvement was diagnosed by either scintigraphy or biopsy. The comparison of scintigraphy and biopsy revealed the following results: Scan and biopsy positive n=18; scan negative and biopsy positive n=5; scan positive and biopsy negative n=3. The last three patients were reclassified according to the BMS. We conclude from this study that BMS using the BW 250/183 antibody visualizes the entire bone marrow with excellent image quality with a low liver/spleen and background uptake, and is clearly superior to the nanocolloid, suggesting that this antibody should be used more frequently in the initial and fo~tow-up stagin.q of malignant systemic disorders. or 100 MBq of .

Eleven patients underwent I~I-MIBG whole body scans, 13 patients underwent ~Tc-AntiCEA scans, 9 patients underwent =\u00b0iT1 scans and 8 patients underwent 9~Tc-DMSA(V) scans'. Confirmation of findings was obtained by CAT scans, NMR and/or surgery. lZI-MIBG scans localized the recurrence in 1 of 11 patients (9%). ~\u00b0IT1 scans localized the recurrence in 3 of 9 patients (33%). ~=Tc-AntiCEA scans localized the recurrence in 5 of 13~ patients (38%). 9~Tc-DMSA(V) scans localized the recurrence in 4 of 8 patients (50%).

Ge-lli* and F.Fazio We have evaluated the feasibility of three-step tumor targeting in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) patients, using the anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (Mab) FO23C5 and the avidinfoiotin system in order to improve the target/non target ratio. Ten patients with histologically proven diagnosis of MTC were injected i v. with l m g of biotinylated Mab. After three days, 5 mg of Cold avidin Were injected i.v.; a third i.v. injection of labelled biotin was made 48 hrs later. Planar and SPET immunoscintigraphy was performed 2 hrs after Indium-111 biotin injection. All patients had increased circulating levels of CEA but only in three of them could conventional methods such as US, X-Ray CT and Technetium-99m DMSA localize the tumor. All patients had abnormal hot spots in the immunoscintigraphic studies. SPET was crucial for detecting small lymph-nodes with a diameter of 4 -7 mm. These lesions, not recognized as neoplastic by US, were confirmed to be neoplastic by fine needle aspiration. One patient, with US suspected solid lesions of 2 cm in the liver, had a negative liver scan and a hot spot in the neck. Histology revealed a benign liver lesion (angioma) and a metastatic lymph-node in the neck. These data suggest that this \"three-step\" method can have an important role in MTC follow-up MIBG is a specific marker in neuroendocrine tumors, such as pheochromocytoma (Ph), neuroblastoma (N), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and paraganglioma (pg), but it suffers in some cases (especially in MTC) of a lack of sensitivity. Thallium (TI) is a well known marker of cellularity with a great sensitivity and a lack of specificity. The aim of our study was to determine whethe r the association of these two markers is able to improve the detection O f neuroendocrinelesions. Patients and methods From 1989 to 1991, 107 sci~tigraphic examinations (exam) wer e performed using 1- in 83 patients (pts) referred either for suspioion (59 exam) o r for follow-up (24 exam) of Ph (52 pts),. N (6 pts),' MTC (i0 pts), MTC+Ph (6 pts), pg (9 pts). chloride was first injected (i MBq/kg), images were acquired from 4 to 20 min ; (4 MBq/kg) was then injected and images acquired 5 h and 24 h later. R e s u l t s Full agreement between MIBG and T1 : 47 negative images (including 5 false negative images with both isotopes) and 12 positive images (3 P h / 3 N, 1MTC, 2 Pg, 3 MTC+Ph) . sensitivities are reported,partly due to the non ideal properties of the radionuclide. A Technetium chelate should overcome the physical drawbacks of 201T1 and w i t h this aim 99mTc-MIBI,a myocardial perfusion agent, has been proposed for parathyroid scintigraphy.We examined the ability of the new radiopbarmaceutical in parathyroid adenomas localization and compared to 201Tl,ultrasound and CT. Sixty-six patients referred for suspected hyperparathyroidism entered the study and among them in the 27 thue far surgically explored,parathyroid enlargements were detected in 23 cases (4 were mediastinal).A correct location of the leeion/s was made in 22 (95%) by in 19 (83%) by 201Tl,in 15 (65%) by ultrasound and in 16 (70%) by CT. In one patient, a tertiary hyperparathyroidism, no parathyroid enlargement was detected and even surgery failed. In 3 patients the lesions resected belonged to the thyrold:one was a papillary carcinoma which showed a high uptake of 201Tl,while the 99mTc-MIBI concentration was very mild. The new radiopharmaceutical proved not only the best sensitivity, but in every case confirmed superior imaging ability, so that in the large majority of patients,lesion detection could be made by visual comparison of 99mTc-MIBI and 99mTcO4scans.We believe 99mTc-MIBI to provide a useful tool in parathyroid adenomas location and guess it will be probably the radiophar~aceutical of choice.",

Servizio Speciale Medicina Nucleate and Endocrinologia (I), II Clinica Medica, University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", Italy. We previously published that IL-2 (a T-lymphocyte growth factor), labelted with 1231, retains its capacity to bind in vivo to activated T lymphocytes, thus allowing the imaging of insulitis in diabetes susceptible animals by using a gamma camera. Aim of the present work was to apply this technique in newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic patients to in vivo image the insulitis process occurring in the endocrine pancreas. Human recombinant IL2 (50gg) was labelled with 1231 using the Lactoperoxidase/Glucoseoxidase method and purified by HPLC before injection into the patient. To date, 4 newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic patients, 2 long standing diabetics and 4 normal volunteers (age matched) have been studied by i.v. injection of 1 mCi of 1231-1L2. Dynamic gamma camera images were acquired for 60 mins after injection and a static image of the abdominal region was also acquired 4 hours later. ROl's were drawn over pancreas and major organs and time-activity curves were generated. In the same subjects we also performed an NMR study before and after bolus of Gd-DTPA using a 1.5 Tesla permanent magnet. Images were analysed using a fat suppression software. Gamma camera images showed that IL2 is rapidly cleared from the blood being mainly up-taken by kidneys. After 20 mins liver and blood activity was undetectable. Only in newly diagnosed diabetic patients we observed a high accumulation of the tracer in the spleen and in the pancreatic region being the first time that insulitis is visualized in humans. In 2/4 cases we also observed a concordant positive NMR result with high pancreatic signal intensity enhancement after Gd-DTPA, a sign of inflammation. 1231-1L2 is highly specific and can be used in alternative to other techniques for in vivo detection of pathological lymphocytic infiltrations.

Since adenomas show similar high signal in T2-weighted images and are often hardly distinguishable from cysts the diagnosis can only be certified by a contrast enhanced MRI showing enhancement only in the wall. The characteristical signal intensity for adenoma is hyperintensity in T2-weighted images and strong, homogeneus contrast enhancement after i.v. Gd-DTPA. Scintigraphic hot and cold adenomas show similar behaviour in MRL But after radioiodinetherapy the perfusion and the enhancement of an adenoma diminished significantly. MRI reveals a high soft tissue contrast and is suitable for imaging malignomas. Regardless of histology malignomas do not show similar signal characteristics in MRI, and are therefore not distinguishable from benign intrathyroidal lesions.

In this work we present some results relative to a new gamma camera prototype completely realized on our research laboratory to localize biological structures sized less than 1 mm. It is based on the use of a new photomultiplier position sensitive recently developed by Hamamatsu (R2486) with a cross wired anode on 6 cm of diameter. It has an intrinsic spatial resolution of about 300 micron. BGO and CsI scintillation detectors with different thickness were tested obtaining about 1 mm FWHM as the best spatial resolution~value. The system consists o~ gamma camera with 5 cm CsI detector diameter, special electronic chain and a 0.5 mm pin hole collimator. 99mT~ HMPAO (370 MBq[ were injected in a rat. The Drain was excisea and fixed-with glutaraldeide and cut into 0.5 cm thick slices. Images of whole brain (sagittal and coronal slices) and cerebellum were acquired. The gray matter was clearly imaged by the system. For example the cerebellar gray and white matter were recognizable in the acquired image without any treatmen. The slice of whole cerebellum were less than 1 cm large. Two different gray matter structures 1 mm distanced were clearly shown. This work has been supported by U.I.L.D.M. section of Rome.",

Some problems found during testing were that some evaluations were difficult to cant out due to unsuitable processing software of the system and that special programs for quality control, which were available in several systems, could not be verified independently. We conclude that comprehensive acceptance testing by the user is indispensable in order to ensure optimal gamma camera performance. User acceptance testing is supported at least partly by most modem camera-computer systems.

Csernay Albert Medical University, I~partment of Nuclear Medicine, Szeged, Hungary OPTIMAL USE OF A DYNAMIC LINE PHANTOM FOR THE DETERMINATION OF CAMERA DETECTOR UNIFORMITY Several methods are known for measurement of the uniformity of a gammacamera. A commercially available device, the dynamic line phantom has recently been proposed for this purpose. It consists of a line source which moves with constant speed over the surface of the detector. The problem is that, for a circular field of view, the observed count rate is a function of the position of the line source; it is the highest in the mid-position. With high count rates, deadtime losses or a pile-up effect may influence the measured values of the uniformity, while for low count rates, the stastistical uncertainity may be intolerable. We performed serial measurements on an older (Picker dyna 4C/15) large field of view camera, without a collimator, using the dynamic line phantom f'flled with 1.5 MBq 99m-Tc until the activity was decreased to 0.005 MBq due to radioactive decay. The uniformity was determined according to the NEMA standard. The uniformity values were stable only in the small activity range 0. 2-0.5 MBq. Below and above this range, they decreased significantly. The uniformity values determined in the optimal activity range are compared with those determined with a 20 MBq 99m-Tc point source in the table, which contains the data of 10 consecutive measurements with the line phantom and 5 measurements with the point source: It is concluded that the dynamic line phantom is suitable for the determination of detector uniformity even on cameras with a circular field of view, but the activity range of the line source for stable uniformity values must to be determined carefully.",

            "text": "Routine QC testing of scintillation cameras usually involves a complex analysis of test results such as uniformity flood images and spatial resolution tests. Based on this analysis the user follows a set of troubleshooting prrecedures when the parameters fail to meet specifications. An expert system for quality control has been developed using a general purpose expert system toolkit ~Nexpert*. Various parameters of quali~ control images were derived by a separate image processing program which forms the basic input to the reasoning module. The objective of the system is to aid human decision making during quality control procedures, interpretation of results and troubleshooting. The major task in creating an expert system was the definition of valid and complete rules. Many rules, examples of which have been provided, are unique to the given camera-computer configuration. The prototype system has been developed using primarily simulated data and the application of the apriori formulated rules has sometimes been insufficient to properly identify the faults. The failure of the expert system to derive a correct diagnosis in these cases indicates the need to expand the rule database. A large database of quali~y control images with various well documented faults from different types of cameras is being collected and data are used to measure the performance of the system. Such a database can be used to incrementally improve the expert systom knowledge base in a learning fashion. In order to assess scatter, scintigraphic images were obtained over the standard 20% width energy window, with a 1 KeV step, either by list mode or multi-windows acquisitions. A detailed energy spectrum can then be obtained and analyzed in each pixel. An evaluation of scatter fraction was performed in experiments with a hot (Tc-99m) Phelps phantom with cold rods placed parallel to the gamma camera face at different distances with interposition of scaterring medium (lucite) of different thicknesses (0 -11 cm). Series of 28 images were obtained from 126 to 154 KeV for each position of the phantom. The energy spectra of 3 categories of pixels with different amounts of scatter were studied: pixels outside of the phantom (P1), over the rods (P2) and the radioactive phantom ( P3). In the areas P1 and P2 with the largest rods, the absence of peak and the low count rate above 140 KeV signed predominant scattering.The best polynomial fits of these scatter spectra were obtained with 3rd order polynoms but integrals of spectra and of 1st order polynoms were not significantly different. In the other areas P2 and P3, a photopeak was observed and increased scattering due to lucite resulted in: 1-the downshifting of 1 to 2 KeV of the peak while its 14 KeV FWHM did not change, 2-a significant increase of the count rate Ct at 126 KeV and 3-no significant count rate C2 change at 154 KeV demonstrating the absence of scattered radiation at that energy. With the hypothesis of a gaussian photopeak, C2 represents the photopeak contribution of C1 and the scatter Value at 126 KeV is (Ct-C2). Consequently, the total scatter count rate of an energy spectrum can be estimated as the triangnlar area 14 (Ct-Cz). The method applied to the phantom images produced considerable gain in image sharpness and the similarity of the different scatter free images. Conclusion: Scatter can be assessed from spectral analysis over the standard acquisition energy window. However, the clinical application still requires the optimization of a filter adapted to low count rate series of images. SPECT quantitation is improved by extracting scatter contribution from the projections prior to reconstruction and attenuation correction. As scatter proportion and distribution depends on the incidence, its estimation requires an adaptive procedure, such as Factor Analysis of Spectral Image Sequence using a Target Apex Seeking (FASISTAS). It has been proven to successfully separate primary and scatter photons in planar imaging for various radioisotopes (Tc-99m, . FASISTAS is assessed for Tc-99m SPECT studies. For each projection, a spectral image sequence covering a wide energy window (60-180 keV), obtained from a list mode acquisition, is processed by FASISTAS. The single a priori knowledge used by FASISTAS is an estimation of the spectral range including no primary photons. From each image sequence, FASISTAS extracts the underlying scatter and pure photopeak spectra and the associated images. The shape and proportion of the two spectra can differ from one projection to another to account for the variations due to the change of incidence. Filtered backprojection and Chang's first order attenuation correction were performed on the resulting scatter free projections. Phantom studies using various object to background ratios (from 0.2 to 6.2) have shown contrast improvement of up to 20% for scatter free slices when compared with conventional slices (reconstructed from 20% energy window projections). Spatial resolution has also been improved without introduction of artefact in uniform regions. By performing an adaptive scatter extraction, FASISTAS is an appropriate tool to improve qualitative and quantitative SPECT, and could be applied to SPECT studies using less favourable radioisotopes.",

It results in possibilities to improve patient's physiological investigation with a special emphasis on quantitation. However, the huge amount of acquired data is difficult to analyze. A global processing method, FAMIS, based on multivariate analysis is proposed to estimate the underlying physiological kinetics and their associated volumetric distributions (3D). FAMIS was initially developed to process dynamic image sequences in planar scintigraphy. The method is based on a statistical fixed-effect model and assumes that each timeactivity-curve (TAC) associated with one pixel is a linear combination of the physiological kinetics. The analysis was extended to simultaneously process the whole set of slices under the single hypothesis that the kinetics shape corresponding to one structure is identical in the different slices. FAMIS is then performed from the TAC related to each voxel, which are clustered and thresholded. They are then submitted to an orthogonal analysis and an oblique rotation under positivity constraints, which provides a reduced number of factors. Factors estimate the tracer kinetics in the different structures : tissues or target organs. Their related 3D distributions are finally computed using a linear regression. The global analysis (time and volume) was compared to the conventional FAMIS approach (time and 2D) repeated for each slice, on both numerical simulations and PET studies. The 4D approach of FAMIS performs an accurate segmentation of functional volumes, improves the extraction of their related kinetics, and avoids the manual definition of volumes of interest. PET images of brain structures such as amygdala, thalamus or basal ganglia, which are relatively small compared to the resolution of the scanner, are degraded by the partial volume effect.",

The LS algorithm is a direct algorithm which does not require any iterative computation scheme and also provides estimates of statistical uncertainties of the ROI values (covariance matrix). A model of physical factors, such as system resolution, attenuation and scatter, can be specified in the algorithm. In this paper an accurate model of the nonstationary geometrical response and attenuation for SPECT studies was considered. The algorithm was compared with three others which are specialized for ROI evaluation, as well as with the conventional method of summing the reconstructed quantity over the ROI. For the latter method, two algorithms were used for image reconstruction: filtered backprojecflon and conjugate gradients with the model of nonstatlonary geometrical response. In these cases, attenuation correction was performed ~nploying the Chang method. For noise-free data and for ROI of accurate shape LS estimates were unbiased within roundoff errors. For noisy data, estimates were still unbiased and the precision worsened slightly for ROI smaller than resolution: with a typical statistics of brain perfnslon studies performed with a collimated camera, the estimated standard deviation for a I cm square ROI was 10% with an ultra high resolution collimator and 7 % with a low energy all purpose collimator. Using conventional ROI estimates with the conjugate gradient iterative algorithm and the model of nonstationary geometrical response, bias of estimates decreased on increasing the number of iterations, but precision worsened heavily thus achieving an estimated standard deviation of more than 25 % for the same I cm ROL These results show that the LS algorithm with accurate modelling of physical factors applied to ROI evaluation allows to recover resolution effects with limited amplification of statistical fluctuations in comparison with techniques where image reconstruction is involved.",

The automated segmentation used a modified split-and-merge algorithm which takes into account edge information during the splitting. We extended this segmentation to 3D and 4D in order to obtain more coherent segmentation results over the whole data set. Moreover, we also took into account the informations resulting from a Fourier transform. The operator is allowed to correct a degree of oversegmentation as a postprocessing step. The volume-time and activity-time plots for the 4 cavities were consistent in time. The left to right ratio of the stroke volumes of the ventricles was 1.02_+0.07 in healthy patients (n= 7) but was significantly increased (2.02+0.64) in 3 cases of mitral regurgitation, estimated at stage 2 by echography. A left ejection fraction of 70% or more and a right ejection fraction of 60% or more were considered as normal. The mean auricle to ventricle stroke volume ratios in normal conditions (7 patients) were 36.5 *. 10.7% right and 33.1 *-3% left.

The system is implemented on a SUN Sparc work station under X-windows. Volumes of size 64x64x64 voxels can be viewed either by browsing through the stack of slices or by generating projections of the volume from different view-points. Projections are displayed as 256x256 pixel image and the surfaces of the objects in the volume can be shaded by means of an illumination model ( e.g. Phong-shading) in order to enhance the users perception of the three dimensional structure of the volume data. To achieve the impression of a rotating volume, sequences of projections are generated by an algoritm that yields a speed-up factor of about 10 over traditional ray-casting methods. In the current implementation, rotation-sequences are generated and simultaneously displayed at sustained rate of about 5 projections per second ( the angle increment between successive 9rojections is set by the user) on a standard SUN sparc IPC. Sequences can also be saved for later replay at even higher animation rates (up 25 frames per second). Other features of the system include variable tresholding and pseudo-colouring of intensity intervals interactively defined by the user. The objective of our study was to compare the hemodynamic changes, the frequency and duration of ischemic ST-segment depression and angina pectoris, the occurrence of side effects and the duration of both tests as a whole, in 31 patients with angiographically proven CAD who where examined with both agents.

A specific binding site for cocaine has been identified in the human brain and related to drug self-administration and to cocaine dependence. The binding site appears to be localized to the dopamine transporter presynaptically on nerve terminals in the basal ganglia. ~-CIT (2 ~ ~ carbomethoxy-3~-(4-iodophenyl) tropane, Kd=0.11 nM) is a cocaine derivative. To examine cocaine binding in the living primate brain ~-CIT was labelled with IIc by Nmethylation of nor~ -CIT with (llC)methyl iodide. The total radiochemical yield of (IIc)~CIT was 40-50% with an overall synthesis time of 35-40 min (inel~ding HPLCpurification and sterile filtration). The specific radio~ activity at time of injection was about I000 Ci/~mmol. In PET-studies (IIc) ~CIT was injected into Cynomolgus monkeys. Specific binding to cocaine receptors was examined in a displacement experiment with unlabelled cocaine. PET-analysis demonstrated accumulation in the striatum with a striatum to cerebellum ratio of about 5 aft k er 87 minutes. In the displacement experimeni, radioactivity in the striatum but not in the cerebell~m was reduced after injection of 20 mg cocaine. This finding indicates that striatal radioactivity following injection of (IIc) ~-CIT is associated with cocaine binding sites and that the binding is reversible. (IIc) ~ -CIT has the potential of a suitable radiotracer for the imaging of cocaine binding sites in the human brain in vivo by PET. TcN-NOET, his (N-ethoxy, N-ethyl dithiocarbamato) nitrido technetium (Tc-99m) is a new neutral myocardial imaging agent now under preliminary clinical studies. In order to improve its imaging properties, we studied the effect of the modification of nitrogen side chains on the uptake of target and non target organs in dogs. The following neutral TeN bis dithioearbamato complexes TeN (R R' NCS2)2 were prepared : R=C2H5, R'=CH3OC2H4 (1) ; R=R'=CH3OC2H4 (2) (1) and (4) on the N side chain shifts the H/Lu maximum ratios toward earlier times than NOET, while two ~-methoxy groups (2) gives a too rapid heart clearance. /~-ethoxy derivative (3) has best H/Lu ratios than NOET but the latter displays the better H/Li ratios during the overall experience. The mRNA of nucleated cells in blood were targeted for developing a new technique of labeling neutrophils by in vivo hybridization with In-DTPAAHON with ttistone4-specific mRNA. The anti-sense oligonucleotide(25mer) specific for histone4 and sense (control) was synthesized with DNA synthesizer and coupled with aminolink (Applied Biosystems). AHON was coupled with DTPA-isothiocyanate and purified by gel-filtration. 200-300 ~Ci of I n -l l l chloride was added and unbound I n -l l l was separated by gel-filtration. Cauine, porcine and human blood was collected in ACD anticoagulant and neutrophils (NP) were separated by Volex-sedimentation. We optimized the conditions of the NP~ uptake e.g. concentration of DTPAAHON, pH, time and temp. Aliquots of human NP, platelets, red ceils were incubated with both probes in ACD-plasma for 30 rain at 37\u00b0C and washed with ACD-saline For a long time attemps have been made to evaluate 99roTe-based tubular secreted renal function imaging agents. In order to substitute iodo-hippuric acid, the development of 99mTc-MAG3 was a first success. Nevertheless, because of the relatively low clearance ( 50 % el. p-amino-hippuric acid) it is desirable to develop new To-based renal function imaging agents. The present study describes the synthesis of 99mTc-Diaminomereapto(thio)ethers as a new class of tubular excreted compounds. Therefore a first compound of this series, ,10-dithia-deeanoic acid (.D has been synthesized by the reaction of Suecinimidyl-Sbanzoyl-thioglycolate and S-Aminoethyl-L--cysteine. The 99roTe-complex of _1 can be obtained in radiochemical yields of > 90 %. HPLC results in a product with a radiochemical purity of more than 99 %, either by hydrolysis of the protecting group prior to the complexatiun (\"cold kit') or during the labeling reaction (\"hot kit\"). The complex is stable at room temperature over 24 hours as well in aqueous as in organic solutions. Octanol-water partition coefficients indicate a very hydrophilie compound, but surprisingly, electrophoresis shows a neutral complex between PH = 2 -7. Organ distribution was determined in rots. Within 24 h 40 % of Tc-DAMTE are excreted to into the feces and 43 % into the urine, whereas 15 % were bound to blood cells and 10 % were retained in the kidneys. In contrast, first studies in humans showed a very fast renal elimination of Tc-DAMTE, a lower liver uptake (< 10%) and no retention in the kidneys. The protein binding of > 95 % and the renal clearance of ea 200 mllmin/1.73 m 2 suggest a high tubular axeretiun rate of the compound. These results show, that Diaminomercapto(thio)ethers are very promising as renal function imaging agents. The synthesis of other DAMTEderivatives will be reported.",

The tendency to correlation between the clinical score and the rCBF values also suggested a link between cortical deactivation and severity of ataxia. Nimodipine is a calcium antagonist that has a potential beneficial effect on the neurologic outcome of acute ischemic stroke. To investigate its effects on cerebral peffasion in acute stroke, we studied 9 patients who suffered a first acute ischemic stroke, and who took part in a randomized trial of nimodipine. The diagnosis was confirmed by clinical observation and CT. Six patients received nimodipine by continuous intravenous infusion, from the first day of their hospitalization to the 5th day onwards. Three patients received placebo. Brain perfusion SPECT with HMPAO was performed on the first and fifth day of treatment. After termination Of the trial, the control group was expanded further with 12 consecutive patients complying with the same diagnostic criteria and treated conventionally. SPECT data were reconstructed and two circumferential profiles consisting of 64 4*4*4 pixel samples were generated, one representative for the frontaparietal cortex, and the other for the lower frontal and the temporo-occipital areas. Data were normalised to the cerebellar activity. Patient data were compared to a database established in 11 healthy volunteers, and consisting of mean values and standard deviations for each data points in the 2 profiles. For each patient study, data in the profiles were recalculated as differences to the mean normal value, measured in standard deviations. An ischemia index, I, was defined as the area (measured in standard deviations) of the profiles extending below the lower confidence limit of the normal population. A hyperperfusion index, H, was defined as the area of the profiles extending above the upper confidence limit. On the first day, no statistically significant differences were found between the treatment and control groups for I (treatment group: 14 =113~106; control group: 11=72+70 ) nor H (treatment group: H~=10~_15; control group: H1=38-+41 ). On the 5th day, ischemia had decreased in both groups (treatment group: 15=93+91 , control group: 15=42+57). Hypedusion had slightly increased in the treatment group (H5=17+19), and had remained stable in the control group (Hs=38+43). However,the changes of I or H from the first to the second study were not statistically different between the groups. In conclusion, within the 5 day time frame studied, we found no significant effect of nimodipine on the extent and intensity of ischemia/infarction, nor on luxury hyperperfusion. Alterations in central nervous system function have been observed after expeditions on high altitudes. The underlying physiopathological mechanisms, though incompletely understood, are presumably in great part related to hypoxia and hypoxia-induced reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Nine members (8 male and 1 female, mean age 32 years) of the \"Belgian Tibet Expedition 1991\", underwent a Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT study before and after their stay on high altitude. Two persons reached a maxi-mal altitude of 8043 m; seven individuals went to -+ 5800 m at least. Each scatter corrected, reconstructed and reoriented data set was submitted to a semi-quantitative analysis, consisting of a circumferential delineation of the cortical and cerebellar activity in 4 consecutive transverse slices: 64 cubic, partially overlapping, 43 pixels containing volume elements (VE) were automatically generated with a constant angular increment of 360\u00b0/64. This procedure was carried out for a lower, middle and upper cerebra! level. The count value of each VE was normalised to the maximal cerebeliar value. In order to compare individual regional CBF (rCBF) before and after the expedition, relative differences in rCBF were calculated for each VE as: relA (%) = 100.(value after expedition -value before expedition)/value before expedition. Results: A) in 4/9 cases regional relA values were negative in most cortical regions (with minima between -10 and -20% predominantly left temporofrontal); in 3/9 persons relA ranged between-5 and +5% and 2/9 climbers showed a positive relA value in most cortical regions; B) the mean relA (per cortical VE) ranged from -9.6 to +6.3%; C) for the group in its totality: 1) a mean decrease of 1.7 % in global cortical CBF and 2) significantly(p<.01) negative relA values (corresponding to a diminished rCBF) in a left temporal-temporofrontal cortex region were observed.",

There was a total of 27 infarctions in the pcgroup, resulting in 21 cases of akinesia and 7 cases of aneurysms of the anterior ventricular wall. Angiographic examinations revealed 17 times a three-vessel disease, 7 times a two-vessel disease. Parametrlc images of regional rates of IPPA clearing (5-oxidation) and IPPA increase { accumulation} for different time intervals after injection were generated by a multi-crystal gamma camera comparing coronary angiography and ventricular angiography. 1 mCi of IPPA was applied i.v.. In comparison of pre-and postoperative fatty acid images we see an increase of metabolic processes in the akinetic and dyskinetic areas after revascularisation in more than 90% of the cases. There was an increase of accumulation and clearing rate of 6.56% (S. ~.=ii.02), 1.23 (S, n 1 =7.8) resp. The subjective wei~:~ing was found us~n~ l questionary also improvement was defined in more than 90% of the pts. We conclude resting IPPA imaging identifies viable myocardium in patients with low EF and hypokinetic and akinetic ventricular wall area, providing a safe, cost effective technique for myocardial viability assessment. patients with systemic myopathies proven by muscular biopsy (mitochondrial (28), Curshmann-$teinert (7), congenital (3 I, muscular-dystrophy (7), etc.), were investigated with 15-(p-[I-123] iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid (IPPA, 6 mCi) and sequential SPECTscintigraphy after subma\u00d7imal exercise, radionuclide ventricu[ography (MUGA) at rest and stress (99mTc-RBC, 20 mCi), ECG, 24 hour-ECG (LECG), and echocardiography (US). The quantitative comparison of the oblique slices of the SPECT-studies revealed turnover-rates as a qualitative measure of B-oxidation. Serum levels of lactate (L), pyruvate (P), glucose (G) and triglycerides (TG) were measured at rest and stress. Anamnestically 85% of the patients had cardiac chest pain. The clinical investigations (auscultation, RR,.etc.) revealed a pathologic result in 40%. In 55% and 75% of the cases the ECG and LECG were abnormal, respectively. US revealed a pathologic result in 47% whereas the MUGA was abnormal at rest in 28% of the patients and, in addition, 25% had a pathologic stress reaction. In 83% of the patients fatty acid metabolism was disturbed (disseminated in 45%; regionally in 38%). In 99% there was a coincidence of abnormal fatty acid results ~ with cardiac chest pain. The IPPA results were not due to raised serum levels of the competing substrates (L at rest: 1.2\u00b10.8; at stress: 1.9\u00b10.9 nmol/I p >0.5; P at rest: 62\u00b121 ; at stress: 66\u00b139 i~mol/I, p >0.5; G and T6 unchanged).

Proposed mechanism for IgG accumulation is binding .to Fc receptors on the foam cells present at the site of the plaque. We performed balloon deendothetialization of carotid arteries in 14 New Zealand male rabbits. After surgery, the animals were fed with normal diet and allowed to heal. Six weeks later 7 animals were injected with 200/zCi of I~I-LDL and 7 animals were injected with 100#Ci of l~qn-IgG. 48 hrs later the animals were sacrificed. Carotid arteries were removed, counted and fixed for autoradiography and light microscopy examination. Contralateral arteries served as controls.",

Inhibited rt-PA was radiolabelled with Tc-99m and has demonstrated promising results of in-vivo thrombus localization in a rabbit model. Commercially available rt-PA (Boehringer Ingleheim) was inactivated with PPACK to permanently inhibit the plasminogen catalytic site. The reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol was used to cleave the disulphide bridges within the rt-PA molecule. Following purification labelling was performed via stannous reduction of pertechnetate in the presence of an excess of low affinity chelating ligand (Gluconate). Two studies were performed, low (100~g) and high (ling) dose injections, which had labelling yields of 45% and 75% respectively. In-vitro studies showed that both preparations were immunologically active, incapable of plasminogen activation and the Tc-99m was bound to intact rt-PA. Thrombi were created in the external jugular vein of New Zealand rabbits, followed by an injection of Tc-99m rt-PA into the femoral vein. A control group was injected with Tc-99m HSA. The initial blood half clearance time for Tc-99m rt-PA was 5 minutes. At 2 hours post injection, thrombus:blood ratio was 4.5 _ 0.96 (mean 4-SEM) and 3.7 __. 0.6 for the low dose and high dose studies respectively. For Tc-99m HSA control study, thrombus:blood ratio was 0.27 4-0.08. Planar scintigraphy visualized thrombus in 4 out of 6 low dose and 4 out of 4 high :dose Tc-99m rt-PA animals. The thrombi not visualized were significantly smaller than those visualized (mean: 30mg vs 164mg, p<0.01). These preliminary results suggests that this radiopharmaceutical may be useful in human thrombosis scintigraphy. OF SYSTEMIC-PULMONARY SHUNTS WITH ECG GATED ACQUISITION The present study aims at the validation of ECG gated acquisition of the pulmonary blood activity as a method to detect and quantitate systemicpulmonary shunts. The method is based upon the detection of the nearly sinusoidal local activity variations oecuring in the lung ROI, during the cardiac cycle, after blood pool labelling with 99mTc and ECG R-wave synchronized acquisition with a Gamma Camera-Computer System 1. The phase distribution of the variations detected in healthy controls shows two peaks for different phase angles, the former represents the pulmonary flow and the latter, small and oecttring at grater phase angles, corresponds to the systemic-pulmonary flow. The ratio of the sum of the amplitudes of the pixels in the 2rid peak m the summation of the amplitudes in all the pixels in the lung ROI gives the relative blood flow of the systemic-pulmonary shunts. This was proved by animal experimentation in the present study. Systemic-pulmonary shunts from the ascending aorta to the pulmonary trunk were implanted in ten mongrel dogs. After introduction of a Swan-Ganz catheter in the pulmonary trunk the flow of the shunt was evaluated using thermodilution by sublracting the cardiac output after and before the shunt's implantation. Linear regression between the values obtained by the proposed method (A values in the figure below) and those obtained by thermodilution (B values) shows r = 0.918 with p = 0.0002.",

The studies of the alveolar-capillary membrane permeability (ACMP) are presently made In Nuclear Medicine using 99mTc-DTPA aerosols, in this work a new method to map the local ACMP to the 133Xe is proposed. The study of the ACMP with 133Xe is a more physiulogical approach to the study of permeability of 02 and CO 2 than the techniques using liquid aerosols. The study can be performed immediately before the ventilation study and using the same 133Xe activity for both. The technique is easy to carry out. The patients lying supine, and after a preparatory period, are asked to inspire a bolus of 15 mCi (555 MBq) of 133Xe to their total lung capacity and retain the breathing for as long as possible. During this time, activity is acquired to a Gamma Camera/Computer System in a sequence with a raaximum of 200 images (64x64) with individual duration of 0.6 s. The processing consists of calculating the mean 'times for the decreasing 133Xe activity on each pixel and building a parametric image. A colour scale is adopted to allow for the quantitative visualization of the local membrane permeability. Former studies of the pulmonary function (ventilation and pea'fusion) were performed (133Xo and 99raTe-HAM). The software developed allows the simultaneous display of the permeability, ventilation and perfusion parametric images, q~is information can also be displayed as four parameter histograms. A group of fourty three patients was studied, divided into 7 subgroups consisting of 5 healthy controls, 16 pulmonary embolisms, 8 interstitial pathologies, 9 POCDs, 3 pulmonary vascular pathologies, 1 pulmonary neoplasia and 1 pulmonary abeess. For the pathologies studied the proposed technique showed sensitivity and specificity. It can be useful in the detection of ACMP alterations and also in the ACMP study of the evolutive behaviour of pathologies eavolving ACMP. The average of the half-times of disappearance for the healthy controls is 28. see. ~Vhen comparing the average values of the half-times of disappearance of 133Xe in the POCD group with the healthy controis, statistically significant differences occur. The same situation prevails for the TEP and interstitial diseases groups, For the groups of pathologies quoted the half-times of disappearance are shorter than in the healthy groups. Advantages of the proposed method with respect to the aerosols tecnhique are: it uses a more physiological tracer; the images have no artifacts; better dosimetry; allows ventilation study with the sgme 133Xe activity; shorter in time and easier to execute.

Methods: [1111n-DTPA-D-Phel]-octreotide (mean dose 281 MBq) was injected i.v., and static images were obtained after 24 and 48 h. Results: Nine of 12 gastrinomas, 11 of 20 insulinomas, ~ glucagonoma, 9 of 11 unclassified apudomas, but none of 18 pancreatic adenocarcinomas were visualized. Also, 58 of 60 carcinoids, 24 of 24 glomus tumors, 18 of 25 medullary thyroid carcinomas, 6 of 8 GH producing and 8 of 12 clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas were visualized. 111In-octreotide scintigraphy revealed the primary tumor and its metastases in 23 of 24 patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), whereas the primary tumor could be visualized in 26 of 27 patients with non-SCLC. AS somatostatin-receptors are absent on most non-SCLC investigated thusfar, their in vivo visualization is probably due to uptake of radioactivity by the tissue surrounding the tumor. In 46 of 66 patients with breast carcinoma, 22 of 28 patients with Non Hodgkin lymphomas, 13 of 13 patients with Bodgkin's disease, and all of 17 patients with sarcoidosis, tumor sites accumulated radioactivity during octreotide scintigraphy. In a considerable number of patients with carcinoids and glomus tumors, but also in patients with granulomas and 111 lymphomas, In-octreotide scintigraphy revealed more tumor sites than did conventional imaging techniques. Conclusions: 111In-octreotide scintigraphy is a simple and sensitive technique to demonstrate tumor localizations in the majority of patients with tumors of neuro-endocrine origin, and also in patients with lymphomas or granulomas. Apart from its merit in tumor localization, 1111n-octreotide scint igraphy, in consequence of its ability to demonstrate somatostatin receptor positive tumors, could be used to select those patients with neuro-endocrine tumors who are likely to respond favorably to octreotide treatment.

Tho CV calculated on a panel of samples with different concentrations of CA 15.3 ranged from 6.2% to 12.3%. Recovery ranged from 95% to 118%. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were evaluated in a preliminary study on 277 patients. The overall sensitivity was 26.9%: 9,5% in patients with negative axillary lymph nodes, 11.3% in node-positive patients and 58% in patients with distant naetastases. The specificity for benign breast diseases was 96%. Single determinations of CA 15.3 were performed in the follow-up of 864 breast cancer 'patients. 731 patients had no evidence of disease, 24 had I ocoregional recurrences and 109 had distant metastases. Only 58 of 731 patients with no evideuce of disease had positive CA 15.3 levels (specificity 92.1%). In relapsed patients the sensitivity was 54% for locoregional recurrences and 74% in patients with distant metastases. In this series of patients the positive and negative predictive values of CA 15.3 were 62% and 95%, respectively. In a group of 150 node-negative breast cancer patients serial CA 15.3 determinations were perfonned during follow-up (range 4-48 months) . Eighteen patients relapsed, 9 with locoregional recurrences and 9 with distant metastases. CA 15.3 levels were increased in only 2 of the 9 patients with locoregional recurrences while of the 9 patients with distant metastases 8 showed a progressive increase in marker concentrations. In the CA 15.3-positive patients, cancer relapse was demonstrated by marker elevation 4-48 months before the metastases were detected clinically. In conclusion, CA 15.3 does not display any validity in the detection of primary tumors and its main clinical use will be in the monitoring of disease-free patients to anticipate the clinical diagnosis of distant metastases. The CA 15-3 is a monoclonal antibody produced against I15D8 and DF3. To estimate the utility of the tumor-associated CA 15-3 in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with breast cancer,. 2224 patients (595 pts with metastasis) were investigated. Thereof metastasis was linulted to bone in 215 pts, to liver in 28 pts and to lung in 56 pts. Plasma levels of CA 15-3 and CEA were determined using IRMA method. The sensitivity and speci ficity of CA 15-3 in detecting a metastasis were compared with those of CEA using several cut-off values. The association of two markers improved the-diagnostic sensitivity of CA 15-3 determination alone. In detecting bone, liver and lung metastasis CA 15-3 had a higher sensitivity (73%,85%,73% vs 62%,67%,41%, respectively) than CEA. During therapy an increase higher than 25% of initial value of CA 15-3 was observed in 74.6% of pts with a new metastasis or recurrence, while CEA had an increase only in 49.3% of pts. During remission CA 15-3 was decreased>50% of the initial value in 55% of patients, but only in 30.6% of pts with CEA. Combination of both markers seems to be confirmatory to detect a metastasis of breast cancer, but CA 15-3 appears to be more suitable than CEA to assess the response to therapy. Application of systemic adjuvant therapy for primary Breast cancer requires the identification of patient at high risk for recurrence.",

Fourty-one patients were studied; 28 of them had breast carcinoma (TINOM0 -T2NP/W2) and 13 ovarian carcinoma (pT2NOM0 -T3cN/MI). In 87 (5~+33) serum samples the concentration of TI~ (as proliferation marker) as well as of CEA, CA CA 125, and CA 72-h as tumoor markers were determined using monoclonal imm~]noradiometric assay (IRMA). A rise of serum TPS was found in 9 of ~i patients (21,9 %), among them 8 of 28 (28,6 %) with breast carcinema (2~ serum samples) and i of 13 (7,7 %) with ovarian carcinoma (~ serum samples); progredient tumour growhhwas noted in these women. An elevation of tumour markers in serum was observed frequently: CA 15-3 in 16 patients, CA 125 in iI, CA 72-~ in 10, CA 19-9 in 7 and CEA in 6 patients. One woman with breast carcinoma showed an increase of solely serum TPS as proliferation marker whereas only l tamourmarker (serum CA 125) followed several months later. According to results of other studies, a rise of serum TPS may be due to an increase of the proliferation of tumour cells. In contrast, an elevation of tumour markers in serum appears to be related rather to the mass of a tumour, possibly the number of tumour cells. A total of 40 patients with advanced prostate cancer (6 stage C, 4 stage D1 and 30 stage D2) treated by hormonal manipulation between July 88 and January 92 were studied to evaluate the use of serum PSA for predicting outcome. All patients had serum PSA determinations before treatment, every 3 months during the first year of followup and every 6 months thereafter, using commercially available radioimmuno-assay kit. Outcome variables were biological progression (BP) and clinical progression (CP). BP was defined as 2 increasing PSA levels within a minimum interval of 3 months. Initial PSA ranged from 1.1 to 212.8 ng/ml ( mean 59.1 -+ 36.2 ng/ml) and followup ranged from 6 to 37 months (mean 22 months). During this period 18 patients presented BP, 15 presented CP and 8 died. For all patients the biological response rate (BR) was computed and defined as the percent decrease of PSA at 3 months. Initial PSA levels and BR rates were correlated to BP and CP.",

BR requires a single determination of PSA at followup to be computed, and provides accurate predicting information eady in the course of the disease. These observations suggest that patients with a BR rate lower than 80% are at increase risk for developing progression and are strong candidates for eady adjunctive non-endocrine therapy. In patients (pts) with advanced neuroblastoma (Nb), measurements of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), serum ferritin (FER) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) have been suggested as useful tumor markers in assessing the success of therapy. In this study, we evaluated 15 pts (7 M and 8 F, ranging in age from 2 to 68 months) with histologically proven advanced Nb pre-and post-5.7+2.7 months of chemotherapy (CRx) (Cisplatin, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, Achiamycin and Teniposide) using iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy (0.5 mCi iv; images at 24, 48 and 72 hrs) and urine VMA measurement. Serum FER and NSE serial measurements were also obtained in 10 and 8 pts, respectively. Abnormal M/BG uptake was qualitatively graded using a 5-point scale (from 0=absent-to 4=peak-activity) on both pre-and post-CRx 48 hrs images. Pre-CRx, a total of 37 Nb lesions with abnormal MIBG uptake were detected. Post-CRx, only 21 of the 37 pre-CRx lesions persisted and 5 new loci of increased MIBG uptake were additionally localized. With CRx, MIBG abnormal uptake was significantly reduced in the majority of Nb lesions (p<0.01). Although the overall reduction in MIBG uptake, there was variability in the change of MIBG uptake for each lesion (decrease, disappereance, increase, no change or new abnormal foci). Although. there was a trend to diminish of VMA, FER and NSE levels, these tests did not show significant differences between pre-and post-CRx values. In conclusion, these data show that: 1) MIBG scintigraphy allows to completely evaluate lesion by lesion the heterogeneity of CRx response in advanced Nb; 2) VMA, FER and NSE tests can only show the functional status of the total Nb masses and are not helpful in defining the response of individual lesions to the treatment. 25 children (18 males, 7 females, aged 10 days to 11 years at diagnosis) underwent 75 MIBG and 68 bone (Tc-99m-DPD) scans. According to the Pediatric Oncology Group classification 1 patient had stage A, 7 each stage B and C, 6 stage D and 4 stage Ds disease. Histology showed 10 neuroblastomas (N1), 10 differentiated neuroblastomas (N2) and 5 ganglioneuroblastomas (N3). 48/75 MIBG and 34/68 bone scans were abnormal. At diagnosis, both studies were performed in 11 children. Uptake of both compounds was shown in 9/11 primary tumors. With respect to histologic differentiation 8/8 N1, 9/9 N2 and 3/5 N3 showed tumor uptake of MIBG at staging and/or follow-up. 2/2 N1 and 1/1 N2 had normal MIBG scans during complete remission. 7 children with proven bone marrow involvement showed bone lesions on concomitant MIBG (7 scans) and DPD (6 scans). Metaiodobenzylguanidine(MIBG) and the monoclonal anti-NCAM-antibod\u00a5 BW575/9 have been proven successful in imaging neuroblastoma(NB). As NBs tend to differentiate to minor malignant counterparts, the question arised, whether or not, and if so, to what extent this cellular change is paralleled by a change in uptake of the above two pharmaceuticals. The answer to this question may be essential for the ,assessment of their value in NB management. The ai~mof this study was to document quantitatively the potential change of both the MIBG-and BW575/9-uptake in an in vitro NB cell line model. We used the human NB cell line SK-N-SH, which is known to take up both MIBG and BW575/9, and RA which induces a variety of differentiated functions,including phenotypic differentiation. MIBG-and BW575/9-uptake assays were established to assess quantitatively the respective uptake in an in vitro cell line environnement. SK-N-SH was continuously exposed to 5 uM all-trans BA for 8 days. Results: Most of the SK-N-SH cells showed a marked increase in neurite extention. MIBG-uptake d~oped down to 57~ of the uptake of control cells without EApretreatment (as already published by our group), whereas BW575/9-uptake raised slightly for about 30~. Conclusions: These data show that (i) RAinduced differentiation is followed by a different uptake behaviour of the two NB-avide substances,i.e, a marked decrease for MIBG and a slight increase for BW575/9. (2) In clinical situations where differentiation of NB is likely, the use of MAbs such as the BW575/9 should be considered as a complement to MIBG for both scint~graphy and therapy.",

Endoscopy, radiographic contrast studies and labeled white blood cell (WBC) scintigraphy are frequently used in the diagnostic work-up of these episodes. Since In-ll 1-1gG scintigraphy has many logistic advantages over labeled WBC scintigraphy, we assessed the utility of In-111-1gG scintigraphy for evaluation of disease activity in patients with IBD. Four male and six female patients with clinical evidence of active disease were studied. Eight patients had Crohn's disease (CD). Three of these patients had CD of the small bowel, two had CD of the large bowel, and three had CD of both the small and the large bowel. Two patients had ulcerative colitis. Scintigraphic images were recorded 4, 24 and 48 hours after injection of 75 MBq . SPECT was performed 24 hours postinjection. The scintigraphic results were verified at surgery, with endoscopy and/or contrast radiography. In-111 -IgG scintigraphy correctly identified presence and extent of small bowel involvement in 5 patients, presence and extent of colon involvement in 4 patients, perianal involvement in 2 patients and abdominal abscesses in 2 patients. SPECT was absolutely essential for adequate interpretation of scintigraphy. Other diagnostic techniques did not reveal additional bowel lesions.",

After oral administration, IPPA is released from the triglyceride by the action of pancreatic lipases followed by intestinal absorption. Radioiodinated benzoic acid (IBA) is the metabolite of IPPA and is then conjugated and excreted in the urine. To establish the normal range of excretion, we investigated 6 normal volunteers and 5 patients without signs of pancreatic disease. About 30 izCi of 1, were administered orally with subsequent urine collection for two 24 h periods. Blood samples were withdrawn after 1,3, 4, and 6 hours in 3, 5, 1, and 2 patients, respectively. TLC analysis was performed on the serum lipid extracts with two different solvent systems. After 24 hours, 76 % of the administered activity was in the urine (SD: 13.8 %) and after 48 hours 98.6 % (SD: 14.9%). The TLC's showed two major peaks which corresponded to the IBA and tripalmitin standards, The proportion of IBA increased with time. No difference was obvious between the two solvent systems. In conclusion, urine analysis after 1, may masure pancreatic lipase activity by a simple non-invasive technique. The s.mall standard deviations of the normals suggest this agent may be useful to diagnose insufficient pancreatic activity. Feeding either CE or CDD induces fatty liver in rats. This project was undertaken to measure quantitatively the effect of fat accumulation on liver function; 10 rats were fed a 36% ethanol diet for 4 weeks and another 10 rats fed CDD for 25 weeks. QMS was performed at 2nd, 5th, and 25th week in the CDD group and at 4 tlnweek in the CE group. Data were acquired at 1 frame/20 sec for 20 min. using a gamma camera after the injection of 30(3 uCi of Tc-99m-Mebrofenin into the tail vein. Hepatic ex traction fraction (HEF) and excretion half time(T-i/27 were obtained. The rats were sacrificed and blood and liver samples were collected for bioc/nemiaal and histoli gical examination. Marked fatty infiltration on the liver was observed in both groups; this did not alter HEF but significantly prolonged T-i/2(mp<O.OS)suggesting a possible derangement in the excretion of bile. It is concluded that QMS may provide a sensitive and noninvasive method for detection and quantification of altered hepatic function due to fatty liver. A new approach to quantify the esophageal peristaltic function (segment pump mechanlsm) has been developed by our Group: DECONVOLUTION analysis. A good specificity and reproducibility was calculated for this method when patients withou~ stsnosis were studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate, with such an efficient methodolo~DL the altered esophageal function in patients with esophagitis and in those with peptic stenosis. PATIE1N~rs: Three Groups of patients were included in the study: Group \"E\", 40 patients ~dth reflux esophagitis, grade II\\III; Group \"S\", 15 patients with a fixed peptic stsnosis; a control Group CC\") of 27 volunteers. M]~2~:IOD: The esophageal transit of two kinds of food mixed with ll3mIn was studied: a) a 3ml water holus (supine); b) a spoon full of a baby flour pope (standing). Acquisition and processing algorithms were implemented for a computerized gammagraphic evaluation by DECONVOLUTION analysis. Two parameters were computed from the output function curves: mean wave transit time (1VfW) and maximal transit time (TMax = clearing time). RESULTS: 1) LIQUII)S: The MW was longer in Groups \"E\" (p<.01) and \"S\" (p<.001) than in \"C\"; in Group \"S\" was greater than in \"E\" (p<.01). The TMax was longer in Groups \"E\" (p<.01) and \"S\" (p<.01) than in \"C\". 2) SEMI. SOUDS: The ~ was elongated only in Group \"S\" (p<.0001); \"E\" mean valugs were not different from \"C' and were smaller than \"S\" ones (p<.0001). No statistical significant difference was disclosed between TMax values in the semi-solid evaluation. 3) In Group \"S\" all but 2 patients have abnarrnal ~ values in both studies.

Most of the hormone producing gastrointestinal tumours contain high density of binding sites for somatostatin. Octreotide, a synthetic, long-acting octapeptide, is a somatostatin analogue which has similar biologic characteristics as the native peptide and allows in-vivo labelling of somatostatin receptor positive mmours. Indium pentatreotide (DTPA coupled octreotide, Octreoscan R, Mallinckrodt Diagnostica, Netherlands) was used for scintigraphy in 8 patients with clinically and histologically proven GEP tumours (4 insulinomas, 3 carcinoids, 1 VIPOMA) The study was approved by the local ethical committee; written consent was obtained. Labelling was performed by the addition of In-111-chloride to the pentatreotide. Quality control, using SEP-PAK R cartridges and methanol as eluent revealed a radiochemical purity of about 95%. After injection of pentatreotide planar images in at least two views and SPECT of thorax, abdomen and pelvis were acquired 4, 24 and 48 h p.i. using routine gamma cameras. There were no false positive results. 3/4 insulinomas were true positive. One insulinoma did not visualize the ligand. The patients with carcinoid and VIPOMA had metastatic disease, which was detectable in all cases. In two of these patients metastatic tissue was identified, which was not detected before by other imaging modalities. SPECT was superior to planar images in visualization of thoracic and abdominal foci. In-111 pentatreotide scintigraphy is a potential tool for diagnosis of endocrine active GEP-tumours. In some cases detection of primary tumour tissue and metastatic disease is superior to X-ray, ultrasound, CT or MR/. High binding levels of pentatreotide in the tumourous tissue can help to consider therapy with octreotide and vice versa. ",

Grading was done with HAMILTON rating scale for anxiety (HRSA). 3 patients with the lowest anxiety score were considered a reference group. Urine benzodiazepine excretion was negative. Methods: Pat. were rested for 15 minutes and then injected with 150 MBq I-IZ3-Iom~zenil. i0 and iZ0 minutes p.i. two SPECT acquisitions were carried out (ORBITER with Neurofocal collimator, 64 increments, 30 sec/ view).

Results: Compared to reference subjects 3 patients with mean HRSA score showed no alterations of perfusion and receptor binding. However, those with \"panic attacks\" revealed decreased receptor density in the right hippocampus(1), and left temporal lobe resp.(2) An additional hypoperfusion was found in this lobe. Conclusions: Decreased receptor distribution may be a reason for unsatisfactory binding of endogene BDZ ligands in panic attacks, a not object related form of anxiety, whereas ligand binding in neurotic forms of phobic disorders seems to be normal.

Thus, for correct interpretation of SPECT resuits treatment of ]PS-pts has to be known and taken into account.",

            "text": "In Parkinson's disease there is a primitive impairment of dopa release by presynaptic neurons of substantia nigra; PET studies in the ear!y stage of PD already demonstrated that the reduction of dopa release results in an increased number of \"free\" dopa receptors (D2 receptors) exposed by postsynaptic neuron on its surfaCe. It was already shown that/-dopa used in PD treatment, reducing the number of \"free\" receptors,, impairs uptake of D2 receptors markers; it is not yet clear how.long it takes to return to basal conditions after treatment suspension. We studied 22 PD patients patients after i.v. injection of 350 MBq of [~z31]IBZM, a new lygand of postsynaptic D2 receptors; according to Hoen-Yahr scale, all patients we~'e graded in the clinical stage I (10 pts), II (6 pts) or III (6 pts); among our patients, no one was graded IV or V. SPET images were obtained 30 minutes after injection (12 patients) or 2 hours after administration (10 patients). Our patients population was divided in two groups: treated subjects and patients with no treatment at all or, at least, for 24 hours; these two groups were homogeneous; als0 between patients who underwent the test 30 minutes after injection and those who underwent SPET 2 hours post injection it was not possible to find any difference. Our results and statistical analysis (unpaired Student t-test) show that there is a significant increment of the basal ganglia/cerebellum uptake ratio from 30 minutes to 2 hours post injection (p <10-9) . This uptake rati o is higher in unt(eated PD patients than treated ones; the difference between the two groups is already highly significant (p < 0.00\"~) if test is performed 30 minutes after injection, but becomes much more significant (p < 2 \u2022 10 \"8) if SPET is acquired 2 hours post injection. Our experimer~tal data, obtained on slight or medium severity PD patients, Confirm that SPET should be performed 2 hours post injection. Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that in .early stage of PD there is an initial impairment of function of presynaptic dopaminergic neurons and an increase in the number of \"free\" D2 receptors on the surface of postsynaptic cells. In vivo imaging of dopamine receptors is conceived to deliver clinical informations related to etiology, drag response and therapy control in parkinson disease (PD). Aim of our study was to evaluate the new D2 receptor ligand Iodobenzamide 0BZM) in de novo parldnson patients and parkinson patients under treatment. The majority of the patients demonstrated latemlisation of their symptoms. Patients and methods: 15 patients (pt) were studied, 6 de novo pt without any previous anti-parkinson medication~ 11 pt had unilateral symptoms or side preference. Duration of disease in de novo pt was 0.75-4 years (mean 1.79) in the othe.r pt under L-DOPA medication (150-1000 rag/daily) 1-12 years (mean 6.1). L-DOPA was withheld at least 6 hours prior to imaging. After iv injection of 185 MBq 1-123 IBZM SPECT was performed (2 hours p.i., 40s/frsme, 64 frames, Sopha medical camera). Back projection was performed with Butterworth 6/16 filter. Uptake ratios of basal ganglia (BG) and frontal cortex (FC) were calculated. Results: Normal 2 hours BG/FC ratios (1.33+/-0.04 according to Tatsch) were seen in 8 pt (1. 29-1.40) , 7 pt had reduced BG/FC ratios (0. 93-1.25) . 5/6 de novo pt had normal BG/FC ratios. Regarding lateralization of PD, 7/11 pt with unilateral symptoms or side preference had an increased IBZM uptake in the affected BG (5-2!% , mean 12%, compared to comralateral BG) whereas only 3 pt showed increased IBZM uptake in the nonsffected BG (6-27%). 1 pt had no different uptake. Regarding lateralization of PD we found increased IBZM uptake predominantly in the affected BG, a finding also supported by PET studies using raelopride. This can be explained as an upregulation mechanism especially i n early disease. From these preliminary data of de novo and hemiparkluson patients we conclude that IBZM D2 receptor scintigraphy can provide valuable information on long term disease course. Poor data about side effects on pregnancy derived from high 131I doses have been reported. We evaluated a group of 68 female patients (pts), who had one or more pregnancies after 131I therapy (131I-TH) for DTC. All pts underwent total thyroidectomy and 131I-TH, in 5 cases to cure metastases to lung, in 16 to lymphnodes and in 47 to ablate remnants. 131I doses ranged 50-300 mCi, mean SD = 118.9 68.3. All pts were then treated with L-T4 at TSHsuppressive doses, thus giving a slight hyperthyroidism. This is known to represent an additional potential risk, other than 131I-TH. for the foetus. All pts were considered to be tumor-free at the time of pregnancy on the basis ot mdiological, scintigraphic and thyroglobulin findings. Mean age~D of pts at the time of 131I therapy was 24.3t5.0 yrs, mean agdSD at time of pregnancy was 29.~t4.2 yrs. During pregnancy, maternal serum T4, FT4, T3 and TSH levels were checked at least every two months and L-T4 doses were modulated accordingly. Foetal growth was also periodically checked. Moreover, in all infants after birth, thyroid function and clinical examination were performed. At present, 72 infants were followed-up and 8 pregnancies are in progress. Mean agr\"SD of infants was 5.1r3.9, ranging 2 mths-15 yrs. Out ol these 72 infants, 1 was affected by Fallot trilogy, 3 had low birth-weight, but a successive regular growth, and the other 68 were considered to be healthy. Due to the mother's mild hyperthyroidism, breast-feeding was preferable no longer than 30-40 days to avoid infant's hyperthyroidism. On the basis ol these data it appears unrational to dissuade young female DTC-pts, previously treated with 131I, to consider pregnancy. However, it is recommended: 1. a time-interval from 131I-TH of at least 2-3 yrs, to evaluate complete remission of disease, and 2. frequent measurements of maternal thyroid hormones during pregnancy to avoid TSH fucreuse or hyperthyroidism.",

In a group of rats injected with 100 #Ci of In-ll4m via labelled cells or plasma, there was complete destruction of the spermatogenic epithelium, with the testicular weight reduced to around one third of age matched controls. Autoradiographs showed that, besides localization in the intertubular interstitial tissue, the Indium radionuclide became associated with morphologically mature sperm and their precursor cells -developing spermatids, apparently within the Sertoli cell cytoplasm. At a later time the In-ll4m could be seen in the epididymas sperm so that the label is seemingly retained during transport of these cells through the organ. It is of concern that In-111 will behave similarly when used in the form of labelled platelets or leukocytes in Nuclear Medicine because of the high mutagenic sensitivity of spermatids to radiation.

This compound is characterized by the presence of the Tc~N group and by a vanishing overall net charge. It is efficiently extracted by heart tissue in varinos animal models and in humans, and the clearance from the myocardium is generally slow (ca. 6 h). This tracer therefore constitutes the first example of a neutral technetiumradiopharmaceutical which remains localized in myocardium cells for a long time. Te-BATO compounds, which form the only other class of neutral myocardial imaging agents presently known, are rapidly eliminated from the heart within few minutes after injection.

In this study, a method to obtain normal bone marrow without inconvenience to the patient is described and compared to a commonly used region of interest (ROI) technique. In five volunteers (group 1, mean age 63.0 yr, range 49 -76 yr), 4 MBq indium-111 labeled human polyclonal IgG (In-111-1gG) was administered 48 hours before placement of a total hip prosthesis for degenerative osteoarthritis. After resection of the femoral head and neck, a bone chip was obtained and bone marrow was aspirated from the medullary space with a biopsy needle. In five patients without diseases affecting bone marrow (group 2, mean age 64.6 yr, range 56 -70 yr), bone marrow uptake was calculated from ROIs over the lumbar spine, 48 hours after injection of 75 MBq In-111 -IgG. Bone marrow uptake in group 1 (4.5 + 1.3 %D/kg) was significantly lower than that in group 2 (8.5 \u00b1 2.1%D/kg), p < 0.01. Bone uptake in group 1 was 1.7 + 0.4 %D/kg. Blood and plasma activity did not differ significantly for both groups (5.5 _+ 1.1 vs. 6.3 + 0.9 %D/kg and 8.7 + 2.4 vs. 10.2 _+ 2.3 %D/kg, respectively). Intraoperative bone marrow and bone sampling provides a system for accurate, direct measurement of normal uptake in bone marrow and bone of all radiopharmaceuticals at various time points. It is a safe and simple procedure without any discomfort to the patient. Since small amounts of activity are sufficient, the radiation dose to the volunteer is low. Andersen et al. found that the lipophilic-hydrophilic transformation (LHT) of 99m-Tc-HM-PAO enantiomers differed considerably in the plasma and the blood, and proposed GSH as the rate-limiting reactant for LHT. However, the possible benefit of using isolated monomeric HM-PAO compounds for CBF studies or cell labeling is still unexplored. We found significant differences in the LHT rates (Kd) of the various chloroform-extracted 99m-Tc-I-IM-PAOs in the presence of 10 mg/ml GSH, with Ballinger's method (Kd. values: meso-:0.00221, d,1-:0.00687, d-:0.00498, 1-:0.01132 s=l). These results demonstrate that the LHT of 1-HM-PAO is about 1.7 times faster than that of the routinely used d,I-HM-PAO. Presuming that this difference would be in vivo too, we have developed a novel experimental leukocyte-labeling method to verify this supposition. Using 20 mg/ml GSH to stop the reaction, we could measure the cell-labeling efficacy with a resolution of about 10 sec. These experiments verified that 1-HM-PAO is \"taken UP more rapidly .and in hig,her quantity by leuk.ocytes than are the d,1-and d-HM-PAO (2x10 ~ cells/ml 1.: 88.27 ~ 4.7% at 6 min, d,l-: 77.53 + 2.6% at 10 min, d-:80.65 _+ 2.77% at 12 min). The cell viability, the in vitro stability of labeling and the effects of volume and cell concentration for labeling efficiency were similar for all isomers of HM-PAO.",

At 0 and 24 hr after administration of the egg-Co57wit.B12, 1 mg of nonradioactive cyanocobalaminum was injected intramuscularly to fill up vit.B12 depot in the body. Urine was collected for 48 hr and Co57 activity measured. A similar test was performed in all patients after oral administration of a capsule containing crystalline-vit.B12. Results: ITLC analysis revealed that more than 99 % of C057 was bound to eggprotein. In normals (serum vit.B12 150 -380 pmol/I) the 48 hr. urine conrained on average 10.5 % of the administered dose (I.D.) egg .

For processing there are new filter techniqves which allow either prefiltering of the raw data or postfiltering of the reconstructe d slices. For display \"Odyssey\" offers the possibility of a three dimensional (3D) image presentation. Within a very short time it is possible to see~a complete SPECT data set on the ~creen. We analysed 3D-SPECT data in many cases of bone scintigraphies, brain studies, lung ~tudies etc. in different ways to find an optimal way of presentation. 3D image presentation is not used routinely, but in some cases it seems to be helpful in understanding the spatial correlation between hot spots and organ surface. Cold lesions can only be seen if they reach the organ surface. If they are inside the organ only special processing allows their visibilty. To d~agnose the cause of pain in knee prostheses, it is necessary to identify the origin, which may be infection, mobilization of the prosthesis or aseptic inflammation. In an attempt to differ-en\u00a3iate among t_hem, a diagnostic protocol has been applied using 3 different explorations: 3-phase bone scintigraphy with DPD-Tc-99m, Ga-67 citrate a~d To-99n~labeled antigranulocyte antibodies (MoAb E~ 250/183), and the results cc~pared with those of 5 patients with asymptcmatic knee prostheses. In all, 25 patients with unilateral and 7 with bilateral krlee prostheses were studied. The patterns observed were: Normal: in the DPD-Tc-99m study, there may be an increase in phase-3 uptake, which is diffuse and nonfccalized, with normal distribution of vascularization, CA-67 citrate and antigranulocytes. Mobilization (9 pr~-theses): periprosthetic hyperuptake focalized in the mobilization sites with DR), and normal distribution in the other twD explorations. Acute infection (5 prostheses Conclusion: DBS is a sensitive method for a s s e s s i n g bone turnover rate according to the degree of skeletal uptake of radionuclide. In this manner it is possible to determine both the type of RO and its further d e v e l o p m e n t in repeated measurements. Patients with peripheral neuropathy or peripheral arterial insufficiency have more frequently various types of pathology and often require a bone scan to distinguish soft-tissue disease from osteomyelitis (OM). A three-phase bone scan was advocated as the method of choice for the diagnosis of OM, but specificity remains insufficient. We evaluated 99mTc-labeled nonspecific polyclonal human immunoglobulin scintigraphy (HIG) in 34 patients (21M:13F; mean age+/-sem: 60.6+/-2.0 yrs) with suspicion of OM of the extremities associated with diabetes or peripheral arterial insufficiency. Three-phase bone scans (BS) were done after iv injection of 20mCi/70kg body weight of . When necessary, a 24-hour image was also done. One day later, an iv injection of 18 to 20 mCi of HIG-99mTc was dor~e and images were acquired at 4 and 24 hours post-inj. The final diagnosis was recorded in the patient file at the time of release from hospital. BS was defined as positive for OM with the c.riteria: 3 phases positive (perfusion, blood pool and delayed image). Resutts: of the 34 BS, 69 focal hypercaptations (FH) were detected on delayed images. Among them, 48 FH were considered as compatible with OM whereas 21 were negative. The HIG scans of the 21 negative FH were also negative. HIG 0 f the 48 positive FH were positive in 31 cases and negative in 17. When the final diagnosis was considered, the 2\"1 FH negative did not have OM. Among the 31 HIG& FH positive, 7 were false-positive. None of the !7 HIG negative & FH positive were falsely negative. Thus the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 52.5% respectively for BS, and 100% and 82.5%, respectively for HIG& BS. Among the 7 false-positive HIG& FH 5 were present in 1 patient who hedimultifocal lesions of gout arthritis. Conclusions: These results indicate that HIG may add valuable information to bone scan, improve dramatically the specificity of diagnosis of OM and should be considered to be done in complicated sit~Jations in the presence of a positive bone scans to increase specificity of diagnosis of OM.",

Various radiopharmaceuticals and different methods have been used to image and quantify inflammation in peripheral joints. ~be aim of this study is to compare ~he response of STom-HMPAO labelled leucocytes and ~Tom-MDP to intraarticular steroid injection. The uptake of both radiopharmaceuticals in the synovium and bone of the knees of eleven patients with RA were measured using an interpolative background subtraction technique. The mean duration of RA was B.2 years. Significant neutrophil migration and MDP uptake occurred in the knees irrespective of disease duration. In the baseline study, neutrophil uptake was demonstrated in the knees of all patients at 22 hours and ranged between 0.014-0.512% of injected dose, while MDP uptake at S hours ranged between 0.357-S.66% of the injected dose. In all but one patient neutrophil mignation in the injected knee was reduced after intra-a~tieular steroid injection. The shanges in MDP uptake after steroid injection were variable. There was linear correlation between the changes in pain scores and those of neutrophil migration in the injected knee (r:O.87,p(O.O01) while a poor correlation occurred between changes in pain scores and quantitative bone scintigraphy [r=o.59,p~o.05). The MDP and white cell responses in the knee contralateral to that injected varied from negative to positive. Conclusion: The quantitation of the neutrophil componen~ of the inflammatory process is a sensitive index for monitoring RA activity and response to phammaoologisal interventions, while quantitative bone scintigraphy should not be employed to monitor changes in joint inflammation in patients with RA. Methods used formerly for the detectior~ of infectious osseous lesions (Tc-99m-HMPAO labeled leukocytes, Tc-99m-anti-granulocyte antibodies) did not always show a sufficiently high specificity (e.g. false positive findings in peripheral bones, false negatives in the spine). The.refore, in a prospective study the clinical significance of the new inflammation agent, Tc-99m-HIG, has been evaluated. 27 patients were thus far referred with the suspicion of: peripheral osteomyelitis (n=3), septic spondylitis (=5), septic prothesis infection (n=6), rheumatoid arthritis (n=10; 6 serum positive; 4 serum-negative), and fever of unknown origin (n=3). The scans were obtained as whole body studies and planar regional images 4 and 24 hours p.i., and were evaluated blindly by two experienced readers.

Due to the high spatial resolution and better delineation, differentiation between dege-r~erative inflammatory or malignant cause of increased osteo-Dlastic activity seems to be more reliable. A Comperative study to Tc-99m MDP Introduction:The present study was undertaken in order to investigate the value of TI-201 scintigraphy in the evaluation of musculoskeletal (MS) lesions, in comparison with Tc-99m MDP scintigraphy. Method: A total of histologically confirmed 102 MS lesions (57 malignant, 45 benign) were included in the study. Static images were acquired 20 min. \"after IV. injection of 3mCi . Within 4 days all patients (pts) were also underwent three phase bone imaging. Lesion MDP and TI-201 uptake ratios were obtained by means of ROIs assigned over lesion and contdateral sites. TI-201 uptakes of lesions were scored according to a four-point grading system taking heart activity as reference. Results:Tl-ii)l and Tc-99m MDP uptakes of benign lesions were 1.32 -+ 0.28 and 2.45-+0.91 (p<0.0005), of .malign lesions were 3.11-+1.52 and 3.16 + 1.27 (p > 0.4) respectively. It is noted that, there was no significant difference in MDP uptakes of benign and malign lesions. On the other hand, uptakes of benign lesions were significantly lower than malignancies, except for brown tumors (n:3) and giant cell tumors of bone(n:5). Seven malign soft tissue tumors showed TI-201 uptake but not MDP. In 5 cases, parenchymal metastases were detected by TI-201 scan. 2 of 7 pts, examined in order to differentiate postoperative fibrosis from recurrency, demonstrated positive scans which were consistent with pathological specimen, while CT and MRI were equivocal. Tumor therapy responses of 4 pts with primary bone sarcomas, monitored by TI-201 scintigraphy were well-correlated with pathological findings. Conclusion: scintigraphy is a valuable tool in differentiation of malignancy from benign MS lesions and local recurrences from post operative fibrosis especially when other methods are equivocal. This modaLity is also reliable in the evaluation of tumor viability in the posttherapy period. Tc-99m-HIG is generally considered as a promising agent for the detection of infectious conditions, It offers several logistic advantages over other agents already applied in this clinical context. The aim of the presented study was to assess the value of Tc-99m-HIG in orthopedic/trauma patients with suspicion of focal infection. 120 patients(82M:38F, mean age 57.6) underwent Tc-99m-HIG sclntlgraphy: All patients had an intravenous administration of 600MBq Tc-99m-HIG, acquisition of images was obtained 4-6 and 24 hours post infusion. Final diagnosis was established by open surgery (75/120) or clinical course (45/120) . Three pathological HIG accumulation patterns were identified: (F)ocal, (D)iffuse or (M)ixed and were judged indicative for infectious conditions. In all patients with proven infectlon(74 ) HIG was shown to be true positive with pattern F in 42/74, D in 26/74 and M in 6/74. In these HIGs, positivity was seen on the 4 hours p.i. images already. In the patients with final evidence of no infection(46) HIG was true negative in 3~/ 46. The 12/46 false positive HIGs were achieved in patients in whom surgery had only been performed <8 days before. In conclusion these rosults demonstrate the high sensitivity of Tc-99m-HIG in the assessment of infectious conditions of orthopedic/trauma patients. However, one should be aware of false positive HIG studies in patients with recently performed surgery. 79 patients with and without significant cognitive deficit were studied clinically and radiologicslly. 25 patients have died to date.",

The aim of the study was to show if depressed responders can be differentiated from nonresponders by different patterns of cerebral blood flow. Patients and methods: We studied 10 depressed patients----~--~-IllhR~ 5 Women, 5 men, 38.9 +-9.1 years) before and after sleep deprivation with Tc-99m-HMPAO-SPECT between 8 and i0 a.m. All depressed Patients had a minimum score of 20 on the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). RESP were defined to show a 50% decrease on HRSD after sleep deprivation. Semiquantitative evaluation of all brain SPECTs was performed and compared to normal subjects (n=8). Results: Five patients were identified as RESP (HRSD 29.1 +-5.7). In RESP. and NONRESP. the left frontolateral cortex was hypoperfused (p<0.01) before and after deprivation, RESP. were additionally hypoperfused in the upper left prefrontal cortex (p<0.01) before deprivation. Perfusion was found to be increased in RESY before deprivation in frontoorbital cortex, right hippocampus, and infratemporal lobes (p<0.01). After sleep deprivation there were no Significant differences compared with normals. Conclusion: The neural circuit connecting the structures with increased perfusion in depressed state is known aS \"limbic loop\" which subserves emotions and their behavloural consequences. Sleep deprivation normalizes the hyperperfusion. The aim of our ongoing study was to compare the results obtained by this technique in two diagnostic groups: major depression and schizophrenia. The other aim was to correlate the results with psychopathological symptoms. We have analyzed the results in 9 depressive and 16 schizophrenic in-patients. The mean HDRS (Hamilton depression rating scale) of depressed patients was ,~r4~0_+7.0. The PANSS (positive and negative symptom scale) ~rating of schizophrenics was 101.5+23.4 (total), 21.2_+8,3 for~positive symptoms, :~7,6+10.5 for negative symptoms, and 52.7+10.5 for general psychopathology. 6 of the depressive and 9 of the schizophrenic patients sho~ed a pathological blood fl~ pattern within the brain. I n 4 9f the depressive patie~,~/~ ~ild in'8 of the Schizophrenic patients we observed a hylJ~lSerfusion of the left temporal lobe. 3 bf the schizophrenic patients also had a hypoperfusion of the parietal lobe. -Schizophrenic\"patients ~itl~ a ~ hyp0peffusion had a significant higher score of PANSS for positive symptoms (p < 0.01) and for general psychopathology (p < 0.05) compared to those wjt~ normal peffusion. Similar results were obtained for the I-IDRS Sc0fe in depressive patients showing a hypopeffusion (.p < 0.05) compared to those with normal HMPAO-SPECT findings. -In conclusion, the hypoperfusion of the left temporal lobe seems to be a common result in both schizophrenic and depressive patients, and psychopathology seems to correlate with pathological cerebral blood flow. More data are required in order to determine the role of specific symptom patterns associated with pathological blood flow results. Podosky.",

Blood and urine samples were collected for 24 hrs. Posterior activity was recorded at appropriate times for 24 hrs to evaluate kidneys time activity curves. Whole body biodistdbution was evaluated at 30 min, 1.5, 3.5 and 5 hrs p.i. by the conjugate counting technique. 2GAM rapidly cleared from the blood ( T 1/2 = 9 min.). Fifty percent of I.D. was excreted in the urine in the first two hours after injection. Dynamic data showed a rapid renal uptake that increases up to 45 min without significant washout over 8 hours, and a low, stable liver uptake as shown in the DMSA under the same experimental conditions. Tc-99m 2GAM is characterized by a faster rapid renal uptake (maximum uptake in 45 min vs. 8 hrs). We conclude that Tc-99m 2GAM has optimal properties for renal imaging in humans showing practical and dosimetrie advantages over DMSA. ",

EF in the normal left kidney was 45% (sd 7.6) and in the right 49% (sd 9.5) whereas poorly functioning kidneys had EF as low as 19%. RBF determination in man is possible using 99Tcm-Mag 3 and its EF can be derived using dynamic scintigraphy. It therefore has the potential to investigate the effects of disease/treatments on RBF and EF. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotrlpsy (ESWL) is a new modality used for treating renal lithiasis. The aim of this s~udy was to determine whether there was any effect of ESWLon the renal function and in particular to demonstrate some possible evidence for the development of obstructive nephropathy. To this end, renal radionuclide studies were performed before and after (24-48 hr) ESWLand the following functions were measured. Relative renal function was assessed as the percentage uptake of the Tc99m DTPA by each kidney. Renal parenchymal transit times were calculated together with glomerular filtration rate values for each kidney. Theeffect of furosemide induced diuresis on the renal images and time/activity curves were also determined. A quantitative evaluation showed that the relative renal function and glomerular filtration rates in both kidneys showed no statistically significant change during post-ESWL period (p>O.05). The parenchymal transit times were prolonged significantly (p<0.05) on the treated side while no statistically significant change was observed on the treated side. We believe that parenchymal transit time is a more sensitive parameter for the evaluation of acute changes after ESWL, especially in the kidneys having relatively poor function. We recommend routine application of radionuclide techniques for the early assessment of obstructive uropathies after ESWL. AIM OF TI-IE STUDY: faced with an adult hip pain without imqammatory signs and a normal X-Ray RSDS and OTNH axe two possible diagnoses frequently involved (other etiologies: fissure, osteuld osteoma, ..). They demand a specific treatment and have a different prognosis. This retrospective study was performed to discuss present indications of BS and MRI for the eaxly diagnosis of OTNI-I and RSDS. PATIENTS: 300 MRI of patients with hip pain without accompanying inflammatory signs and with a normal Xxay include 50 OTNH and 25 RSDS. Among these 75 patients 43 patients with comparable MRI and BS were retained (25 OTNFI and 18 RSDS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1/MRI: A 0.28T (Bruker) was used. The standaxdLzed protocol was: T2 RARE/3000/22 (coronal.) and T1 MSSE/350/22 (sagittal). 2/NM: The gamma-camera (Elscint) was used in the planar mode for 3Phase BS 99mTc-MDP (740MBq) and qualitative analysis (films) was performed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 1/MRI: sensitivity and specificity were close to 100%. 2/BS: a/OTNI-I a hot spot was found in 41/50, diagnosis of ONTH was suspected in 35/50. The raise negative (9/50) concern a controlateral pathology which was described (a hot spot in all cases) only when clinical symptoms were present b/RSDS all scans were positive but RSDS was suspected in 2/18 cases. Our data suggest that routine 3PBS has too low a specificity for the early diagnosis of OTNH/RSDS and is not sensitive enough for the diagnosis of a nonsymptomatic controlateral OTNFI. MRI was very efficient in both cases. The difference might be explained by the high resolution attainabIe rather than the specificity of the signal. These results might be reconsidered using, SPECT and seml-quantitative analysis which axe now being implemented. Nevertheless it seems to us that in these cases MRI is the procedure to chose when available. ",

In a group of 16 non-smoker patients with sercoidosis (3 male, 13 female, mean age 44.2 years' old, minimum 22 and maximum 66) we calculated and correlated this parameter with the radtological stage, the CO diffusion, the serum Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) and the grading of gallium-67 lung uptake. The patients had either normal (n=8), slight obstructive (n=l) or restrictive (n=7) lung function as determined by a complete set of pulmonary function tests. The inhalation studies were pert'armed after a 2-3 rain inhalation af 20 mCi of 99mTc-DTPA in a 2ml solUtion (CIS), in postert~anterior view, dynamic mode, during 30 rain, 30see]frame, in a 128x128 matrix, started immediately after the beginning of the inhalation. Lung epithelial permeability (IF.p) is calculated from clearance curves obtained from a total lung ROI and expressed as the half-time clearance of the lungs (normal >_ 80rain the LEP measure in these patients seems more sensible than CO diffusion (altered only in 3 patients); -it seems that active inflammatory process is a coadjuvant factor in the grading of LEP lesion; -LEP in these patients seems a good index of epithelial integrity and, being a quantitative parameter, may allow a more strict monitorization. Combined ventilation-perfusion (V-P) lung imaging using the ventilation first approach has the disadvantage of performing a significant number of unnecessary V studies since a normal P scan excludes pulmonary embolism (PE) with high certainty. However, post-perfusion aerosol V imaging requires a delivery system with high lung deposition efficiency. A new aerosol device (Mallinckrodt, Petten) using dry air (relative humidity 15-18%) for jet nebulisation of 99m Tc-DTPA generates a submicronic aerosol (MMAD 0.37#m, GSD 1.8), Lung deposition efficiency (percent activity of initial nebuliser load deposited in the lung) was 30-40%. Quantitative comparison with 81m Kr demonstrated excellent peripheral penetration (n=14, r=0,75, p<0,001) and comparable regional distribution (r=0,94, p < 0.001), A multicenter trial compared the immediate post-perfusion V approach (inhalation scan I) with a V scan performed on the next day (inhalation scan II) in 169 consecutive patients with clinically suspected PE. P imaging was perfo{med with 37 MBq 99m Tc-microspheres, initial nebuliser load for immediate post-perfusion V imaging was 370 MBq, for 24hr V imaging 185 MBq 99m Tc-DTPA. Agreement with respect to assessment of P defects matched or mismatched to ventilation was found in 166/169 (98%) patients. Image quality of inhalation scan I (underlying P) was equal to scan II in 72% of studies, image quality of scan I was superior in 11%, of scan II in 17%.",

We have assessed the ability of experienced observers to detect and locate defects of known anatomical location and size on the pesterer view lung scan by placing temporary occlusions at the openings of selected bronchi during fibreoptic bronchoscopy, with an inflatable balloon catheter. Ventilation studies were then performed in the standard projections using 'l=Kr. Occlusions of all lobes and segments were studied. Photographic images of the posterior views were presented to two independent, experienced Nuclear Medicine physicians who were asked to classify each scan as normal or abnormal. If abnormal they were asked to identify the lobe or segment involved. Results: A. Segments: 20% of the posterior view scans known to contain segmental defects were judged to be normal. 44 % of segmental defects were located to the correct lobe and only 25 % to the correct segment. B. Lobes: A scan known to have a lingular defect was judged to be normal by both observers. A right middle lobe defect resulted in a slightly abnormal scan but could not be identified as lobar. Conclusion: This study illustrates the limitations 6f the posterior view ventilation scan in identifying and locating defects to compare with multiple view perfusion scans. The results suggest that methods of ventilation scanning using the posterior view alone will tend to overdiagnose ventilation-perfusion mismatch, inappropriately displacing scans into higher probability groups for pulmonary embolism. Investigation of the lower limb venous system to d\u00b1~gnose DVT and/or the measurement of the serum D-Dimer levels have been advocated as alternate modes of investigation to pulmonary angiography in patients wi~h an intermediate V/Q scan. We have prospectively examined 21 consecutive patients without clinical evidence of DV~ who had an intermediate V/Q scan and who snbsequently had a pulmonary angiogram performed. All patients had the V/Q scan, pulmonary angiogram, bilateral lower limb venous doppler ultrasound and serum D-Dimer levels ~easurement by both the ELIZA and slide latex agglutination methods within a 24 hour period. 7 of the 21 patients (33%) had pulmonary embolism demonstrated on pulmonary angiography. Only one patient with PE (14%) and none of the patients without PE had DVT demonstrated on ultrasound.Thus, lower limb venous ultrasound had a sensitivity and specificity of 14% and 1Q0% respectively. D-Dimerwas measured using both the slide latex agglutnation and the ELIZA assay. There was no significant difference in the serum D-Dimer levels between the patients with PE and those without PE using either method of measurement, Levels above 2mg/l are generally considered to be significant for venons thromboembolism. There was only one patient with a D-Dimer of greater than 2mg/l and this patient had a negative angiogram and ultrasound. ",

The effect of the between-run variability on the diagnostic accuracy (discrimination between normal and subnormal values) was calculated for three representative TSH concentrations (one -0.2 mlU/L -below the cutoff value, and two -0.4, 0.5 mlU/L -in the lower part of the normal interval) assuming a value of 0.3 mIU/L as the lower normal limit.",

Moreover, the effect of the between-run variability on the ability to discriminate among two low TSH concentrations (as needed in monitoring over time patients under T4 suppressive therapy) was evaluated. Using the most precise kit it is possible to distinguish two TSH concentrations -in the range 0. .5 mIU/L -differing 30% at least; with the other less precise kits, differences larger than 50-60% are needed to reach a reliable discrimination. These findings demonstrates that a large number of the laboratories fail to achieve the functional sensitivity of a \"second generation\" assay even if they use immunometric methods and emphasize the need for developing TSH assays with a better interassay precision in the low concentration range.",

No relation was found between TMAb or FgAb variations and thyroid function after surgery.

The short halflife allows a shorter hospital stay. Response to conventional chemotherapy in myeloma is 30-60% but is generally incomplete and of short duration. Total body irradiation (TBI) with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) greatly improves response rates but 15% of patients experience serious nonhaemopoietic radiation toxicity. We have used the inbred C57BL/KaLwRij mouse to develop a regimen of internal irradiation with the Sm-153 labelled bone-seeking chelate ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) with Melphalan chemotherapy to ablate bone marrow whilst preserving the capacity for haemopoietic recovery following syngeneic BMT. Treatment with 25 MBq/kg 153Sm-EDTMP and 18.5 mg/kg Melphalan prior to BMT in mice bearing 5T33 murine myeloma was initiated at 3 days and at i0 days following tumour inoculation of 8x105 myeloma cells in groups of 6-12 animals. Survival was compared with untreated controls and mice treated with 153Sm-EDTMP or Melphalan alone. Controls survived 23.1+0.3 days. Animals treated with 153Sm-EDTMP or Melphalan--alone survived 28.8+1.1 days. Combined chemoradiotherapy extended surviva~ to 37.2~1.7 days. Thus treated animals survived longer than controls (p< 0.01) and the combined chemoradiotherapy was significantly more effective than single agent t~eatment (p< 0.001). Monitoring of blood levels of the IgG2b paraprotein of treated 5T33 murine myeloma showed slower appearance time. The survival advantage conferred by the combined 153Sm-EDTMP/Melphalan chemoradiotherapy regimen for BMT in murine myeloma shows the potential for clinical application of internal radiotherapy for treatment of haematological malignancy. acid ( Sm-153-EDTMP ) may be beneficial for treatment of bone pain caused by metastatic lesions. isotope has favourable physical charscteristics with a half life of 46 h, suitable betaemissions and iQ3akeV gamma emission, making it suitable for therapy, and also for bone imaging and prospective estimation of radiation dose to metastases and bone marrow.",

The study was approved by the hospital review board and all patients gave witnessed informed consent.

            "text": "A. TOOD The ability to transfer image data between different systems is essential in nuclear medicine for both clinical and research requirements. The Interfile definition as originally published has been implemented by a number of manufacturers and has been developed under the auspices of the COST B2 Software Quality Assurance project of the EC. However, it has become apparent that a number of uncertainties exist in earlier definitions, in particular V3.2, which has therefore been revised. The new definition is expressed in a formal notation, and permits many important extensions. Formats for regions of interest and curves, the transport of data (additionally) in ASCII and floating point formats, and the definition of centre of rotation information are all now enabled. A mechanism for ensuring convertibility of Interfile data to other definitions such as ACR-NEMA V2.0 and V3.x (LEAPFROG) has been established. However, there remain many areas which are not currently covered, for example gated SPECT studies, and multidimensional studies in general cannot be transferred. Thus while V3.3 is conceived as a rectification of previous versions of Interfile, it is also intended as a stepping stone to a more general transfer format definition. For this reason, indexed variables and folders are being gradually introduced such that the current Interfile definition can be used with relatively little effort to enable the transfer of all types of nuclear medicine (and perhaps other types of) data. The current proposal is reported, future potential developments are presented, methods for implementation are reviewed and, in particular, the rationale is discussed to show why change is required and how such change is appropriate with respect to other potential standards for image transfer in medicine. A Muhi-Mddia MedicaI record (MMMR) dedicated to Nuclear Medicine has been created with two purposes : 1) to provide the Nuclear Medicine physicians all the data necessm2\u00a2 for interpretation of Nuclear Medicine images and 2) to store those data within the Nuclear Medicine Department. The Multi-Media Medical record, applied to nuclear medicine includes text (medical report), structured database (medical data), images and oral messages (oral report, first interpretation for emergency exams). In order to implement such a MMMR, a workstation based on a PC 386 microcomputer equiped with DVI cards, software for image compression and decompression and OST cards for the NUMERIS access has been created. The capture of images is performed through digitization process using video JVC camera. Oral messages and sounds are also digitized and stored by means of microphones or audio stations. All images are displayed on high resolution SONY TV screen; their manipulations used DVI software facilities. The transfer of all complex data structures between hospital or physicians is realized by the ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) network NUMERIS throught wich images, records and phone call can be transmitted for a price less than twice a phone call. With the interactive tool \"tele-cursor\", which performed the real-time work on medical images between two distant physicians, the physician can point a local region, delineate a zone, draw on an image, and this draw appears in real-time on the TV screen of the distant physician. This tele-cursor tool, is the first step towards a real computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) in Medicine for the following years. The multi-media setup has been successfully tested in our institution with four Nuclear Medicine physicians. A collaborative programm of data exchange and interpretation of nuclear medicine images is in progress between Paris and Lille. ",

These two components are considered as rigid sets of ponctual masses. Each point of set 1 is attracted by its nearrest point of set 2 by a force proportionnal to the distance. The fondamental laws of Dynamics are then applied to that system. Motion is computed by an iterative time-dependant process providing translation and rotation parameters of set 1 at each time.

Aim of the present study is the development of a new method for the 99mTc-labelling of biologically active peptides with high S.A. and retained binding activity. Labelling was performed via a two-step reaction using a bifunctional chelate with two active sites: one providing an N3S ring for coordination of 99mTc and the other, an activated ester, for protein binding via lysine residues. Ligand is first labelled with 99mTc and then conjugated to proteins. In order to preserve the immunoreactivity of proteins a low ligand:protein ratio must be used. To obtain a high specific activity, factors improving the incorporation of 99mTc into the ligand were studied such as boiling time, pH, stannous chloride, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and gentisic acid concentrations. Optimal conditions were found as follow: the ligand (8 nmoles) was incubated in presence of stannous chloride (58.33 Ixg/ml), gluconate (1.45 mg/ml), IPA (20.83%) and gentisic acid (58.33 I.tg/ml) with 99mTc (800 MBq) for 8 minutes at 100\u00b0C at pH 2. After cooling at 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes, pH was raised up to 9 using borate buffer 0.5M, and the chelate was incubated for further 30 minutes with a test proiein, intedeukin-2 (60 ktg) at r.t.. Radiolabelled IL2 was then purified from unreacted chelate and 99mTc using a gel filtration Sephadex G50M column. In this condition labelling of the ligand was 78% and the labelling of the protein was 38% with a S. A. of about 4000 MBq/mg.

The number of SH groups generated, determined by Ellman's method, was 3.5 and 5.5 per rHIG and m_HIG molecule, respectively. Lyophilized kits containing ling of either rHIG or mHIG and a small amount of MDP (Sn) kit corresponding to about 1.3 and 8.2 I~m of tin(II) were prepared: The 99mTc labeling of the HIG preparations was accomplished by adding the 99mTcO4\" eluate. Radiochemical purity greater than 98% was achieved as determined by ITLC for both preparations. The stability of these radiolabeled preparations was evaluated by Cellogel etectrophoresis.

Using electrophoretic tectmiques, similar instability was found for the commercial Technescan HIG, Mallinckrodt Diagnostica kit (ling 2-irainothiolans modified immunoglobulin and stannons tart~ate). Biodistribution studies of 99mTc-rHIG and 99mTc-HIG (Mallinckrodt) in mice bearing inflammation in right thigh induced by im. administration of a single clinical isolate of S.

We have performed 363 technetium 99m teboroxime (TEBO) myocardial perfusion studies in an outpatient office. Perfusion studies were performed on a single detector SPECT camera within 90 seconds of cessation of treadmill stress testing. Imaging was performed over 180 degrees, starting from LPO to RAO using 32 stops at approximately 8 seconds per stop. Total acquisition time was approximately 6 minutes and stress and rest studies could be completed within 90 minutes. Results of the perfusion imaging were compared with cardiac catheterization, treadmill stress testing, and/or subsequent clinical course. Analysis of the 363 studies showed 239 were normal and 124 were positive for ischemia, infarction, or both. Sensitivity and specificity were each greater than 95%, and accuracy compared with coronary angiography was 91%. Myocardial perfusion imaging with TEBO is an acceptable alternative to thallium imaging in an outpatient setting. The images obtained ere equal to or better than thallium, studies can be performed on a single detector SPECT system, and patient throughput can be significantly enhanced using TEBO.

HMPAO-SPECT In contrast to temporal lobe seizures the frontal lobe epilepsies (FLE) undergo a peculiar pattern of the ictal course, since after frontal onsetting epileptic discharges may propagate via a network of neuronal pathways, thus mimicking an extrafrontal focal seizure. Patients and methods: i0 patients with drug refractory FLE were included in preoperative monitoring. NMR imaging revealed structural lesions in 5 subjects (2 traumata, 1 atrophy, 2 white matter lesions). Focal localization was performed by means of implantable subdural electrodes and with the help of \"ictal HMPAO- SPECT\" (injection of 500-700 MBq Tc99m-HMPAO within one minute after ictal onset ). In 2 patients four ictal SPECTs were acquired. Results: 7 Patients with frontal loci could be localized and underwent surgical resection(n=6) or callosotomy (n=l, bothside loci) . In 3 of resected subjects no morphological alteration could be found, others had ganglioglioma (2) TO compare the usefulness of Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT and F-18 FDG PET in presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable focal epilepsy,12 patients (9 women~ 3 men) were consecutively studied with prolonged video EEG monitoring (EEG), MRI, PET, and SPECT. Seven patients had a unitemporal focus (Grou p I) and five patients bitemporal foc\u00b1 (Group II). I~ the interictal phase, a PET scan was performed with 5-10 mCi 6f F-18 FDG and SPECT with 10-20 mCi of Tc-99m HMPAO respectively. We developed a semiquantltative 3-dimensional method (SQ-3D) for interpretation and comparison of PET and ~PECT using an anatomical temporal lobe compartment model to allow quantification of the extent of surgical resection. This allows a simple index based on the degree of asymmetry and the number of abnormal regions of interest.",

The purpose of the study is to e v a l~t e F-18 FDG PET findings in patients who are surgical candidates with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) but with normal MRI. Forty-two consecutive patients with TLE and normal M~RI: 22 males (ages 5 to 44 yr) and 20 females (ages 5 mo to 53 yr) were studied preoperatively. All patients underwent prolonged EEG/video monitoring with scalp-sphenoidal electrodes to localize the epileptogenic focus. In the interictal state, 4-10 mCi of F-18 FDG was given IV and scans were performed at 40 min. post injection. Reconstructed tomographic images in 3 planes were analyzed visually and semiquantitatively.",

Material and Methods : 187 children 0-6 years of age (median 5 months) with their first recognised UTI were studied, Inclusion criteria were significant bacteruria and temperature >38.5 \u00b0, For children below one year fever was not required. The study population comprised an estimated 90% of all chil4ren in GOteborg fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The study protocol included clinical history, laboratory findings, DMSA scintigraphy, IVP and VCUG. The DMSA scintigraphy was performed 1-66 days (median 13) after start of s y m p t o m s and classified as normal, equivocal or abnormal. Results: 43% of the children had abnormal DMSA scans and 18% had equivocal. The scan was performed within 14 days of start of symptoms in 105 children. In this group 53% had abnormal scan compared to 30% in those with later scan. The frequency of equivocal findings was 10% in the group with early and 27% in the group with late scans. 74% of the children had temperature ->38.5 and CRP >20 and were classified as pyelonephritic. Of these children 52% had abnormal scans. In those with early scan the frequency of abnormal findings was 64%. Conclusion: In children with clinical signs of first time pyelonephritis the frequency of abnormal DMSA scans was 52%. Even when the scan was performed shortly after initiation of treatment as m u c h as 36% of the scans were normal or equivocal. Various explanations can be offered: the kidneys were not involved or discrete changes were not detected or had disappeared due to early and effective treatment. The presence of focal renal damage gives a child a 10% chance of developing hypertension in the latter life. Tc 99m DMSA has a high sensitivity in the detection of a scar, and allows estimation of differential function. In children with a urinary infection indirect cystography is frequently carried out to assess differential function and exclude renal reflux. Analysis of the MAG3 study included differential function assessment and the evaluation of scars on a functiona'l image created on a pixel by pixel basis, representing renal clearance based on the Patlac plot. The functional MAG3 clearance image was created in a series of children with normal Tc 99m DMSA scans. Different levels of noise were added to the images to ascertain the minimum count rate required to produce a useful image. The results suggest that at count rates encountered in clinical practice using a dose schedule of 80 MBq/I.73 m ~ and normal renal function will provide a MAG3 clearance image with a sensitivity of 80% in the detection of a renal scar. Thirty four children with UTI underwent both Tc 99m DMSA and MAG3 within 4 weeks. Good correlation between the differential function on DMSA and MAG3 was found (CC = 0.97, R ~ = 93.9%), the sensitivity of Tc 99m MAG3 in the detection of a focal defect in the presence of normal differential function was 80%. Tc 99m MAG3 in the clinical setting of a chiId with urinary infection allows accurate assessment of differential function. A normal functional image suggests that there is a n 8 0 % chance of the kidney being normal.",

Several tecl~fiques acquiring a series of frames in time or in energy in order to assess some multidimensional image properties have been proved useful to describe the elementary imaging processes such as the scatter contamination or the dynamics of physiological phenomena. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is generally used to extract the image features. PCA explicitly assumes that an image in the multidimensional energy space can be decomposed in a series of orthogonal features. Oblique rotation can be used to further refine the multidimensional description of the data for nothing ensures that features are effectively orthogonal. But oblique rotations address only the description of the non-principal axes since the first will always be the direction that cumulates the highest possible variance. However, a simple inspection of the multidimensional data clearly shows that the main (first) axis is intrinsically curvilinear. The new model allows for a more complete variance compression and a reduction of the (effective) image dimensionality. The curvilinear model has been tested using both simulated images and clinical data. Proportion of the variance contained in the principal axis due to this curvilinear model is highly object dependent and ranges from almost nothing (adequacy of the linear model) to 5 to 8 % in the worst case. The curvilinear model explains the fine structure of the holospectral data leading to a higher accuracy in the image description and object estimation. ",

            "text": "A precise quantification of SPECT images requires an accurate correction for attenuation. When attenuation coefficient (It) maps are measured from transmission scan, cumbersome iterative methods are necessary. A significant attenuation compensation can be mathematically obtained by dividing each actual pi\u00d7el value of emission projections by the average of all the attenuation factors ( exp (-~ Ix ) ) of all voxels along the same projection ray. The efficacy of this simple method, compatible with filtered back projection algorithms, has been tested on simulations of cardiac and cerebral transaxial images on a Vax using the RECLBL library. In the cardiac model, myocardium, chest wall, lungs, mediastinum and spine received different activities and It values. In the cerebral model, striata, cortex, white matter and skull had also different activities and ~ values. Three types of emission projections were generated: the ideal projections obtained by summation of activities along each projection ray, the corresponding attenuated projections and the ones corrected for attenuation. Comparison of projections on a pixel by pixel basis showed differences of less than 10% between the corrected and ideal projections whereas the attenuated projections underestimated the true count rate by at least a factor of 3. Using filtered back projection, the above attenuation correction method greatly improved: 1-the quantification of the absolute activities of the different structures, 2-the striatum to cortex activity ratios and 3-the relative uniformity of the myocardial activity. In models, this simple method produces an efficient compensation of attenuation on the projections and does not require a systematic segmentation of the attenuation coefficient (It) maps. Cone beam transmission maps are currently obtained in patients with an uncollimated gammacamera for further validation of the method. The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.",

Time-activity (TA) curves for fixed regions are commonly used to evaluate the transport of food through the gastrointestinal tract. The input function describing the food entering the organ is highly variable and does not resemble a Dirac functiou. Deconvolution is impossible. Therefore TA-curves are difficult to analyze and prone to erroneus interpretations i.e. due to reflux. Pathology proximal to the region also modifies the i~lput function. Compressed images are of limited help i.e. reflux and the delayed swallowiug of part of the activity cannot always be distinguished. We describe an algorithm, to obtain a set of time-locatlon (TL) curves of the activity, that is unbiased in the statistical sense. The method remains valid even when part of the ingested activity is not in the field of view of the camera for some time. It is compatible with all classical corrections such as for motion, attenuation, scatter and decay. The TL-curves describe the position at any time that was passed by a certain percentage of the ingested activity. The time interval between the passage of two anatomical points for the 50th percentile TL-curve is a true transit-time, independent from the shape of the input function. The difference between the transit times for different percentile curves can be used as a measure of convolution ('m.ixing') when combined with the difference in arrival times at the input of the organ(segment). The method was successfully applied to compressed images obtained from oesophagal transit studies and gastric emptying studies. Conventional pharmacokinetic modeling does not satisfactorily define the early phases of tissue biodistribution of radiolabeled murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) in patients. In particular, nonspecific MoAb binding in the liver, spleen and bone marrow does not seem to follow a linear, first-order kinetics. To test this hypothesis, the experimental design was optimized to characterize early biodistribution immediately after injection of a radiolabeled MoAb, and a new pharmacokinetic model was developed to fit such experimental data.",

We have shown experimentally on a series of uniform discs of activity that the R.M.S. uncertainty is related to the number of counts in the image (n) and the number of pixels (N) containing the activity by the Budinger Equation : RMS = 120 N ~4 / nm. The geometrical efficiency of a parallel slit collimator is 100 to 200 higher than for classical holes collimator. For a 1000 pixels object, R.M.S. is reduced by 1.5 to 2. It follows a 3-fold increase in effective sensitivity We have used a phantom consisting of a series of cold spots (4 mm to 18 ram) surrounded by uniform Tc-99m activity to compare our rotating slit collimator with a hole collimator of the same resolution. We have observed that the effective sensitivity is multiplied by 3 for the slit collimator, without decreasing the resolution. Tomographic acquisition were performed on a brain phantom. 60 frames were acquired for each of the 60 steps of the tomography. We have compared the slit collimator with a high resolution parallel collimator and a fan beam collimator. The fan beam gives a better resolution than the parallel high resolution with the same count rate. The resolution of the slit collimator is better than the fan beam with a higher sensitivity. Non statistical differences were obtained in the indexes between groups, and high, medium and low uptake areas in each slice could be better resolved in the images of the B group.",

This is usually carried out by imaging the 364 keV photopeak using a gamma camera with high energy collimator operated in either planar or tomographic (SPET) mode. Using such standard techniques, it was found that septal penetration and scattered radiation from the higher energy peaks of 1-131 resulted in a significant number of counts recorded in the 364 keV photopeak window which then significantly affected quantitation. In typical patient measurements the average contribution over the whole field of view was found to be 20 to 35% of the 364 keV photopeak counts. Within the image, however, the contribution varied widely, being lowest within small areas of high activity and highest within areas of low activity adjacent to high activity. Phantom measurements indicated that septal penetration of the higher energy photons was the major component of this effect and that improvements in accuracy of quantitation could be achieved by subtracting an image acquired simultaneously at an energy just above the photopeak. Since this secondary image involved mostly low spatial frequencies it could be smoothed to minimize added noise. The method was applied successfully to patients who had received 1-131 labelled antibodies. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of in-house service engineers, ccmpared to vendor service contracts, for the maintenance of nuclear medicine gamma cameras.

In general, resolution of a gamma camera is measured by using a point or a line source, imitating a delta function as input to the system. But this technique may only be applied if the size of the source is very small compared to the resolution of the gamma camera. In practice the activity concentration will be the limiting factor, especially when gas filled sources (e.g. 81mKr) have to be used. However, if the theoretical projection of a source on the detector can be determined, then the system resolution can be computed from the measurements of the extended source by means of iterative deconvolution. (Due to the finite extend of the ideal projection of the source and the noisy acquisition data, the usual deconvolution methods -sequential deconvolution or via Fourier transformations-cannot be applied.) We have tested this technique for thick, tube shape sources filled with 99mTc and 81mKr, both in air and submerged in water. The measurements were compared with resolution measurements using very thin line sources filled with 99mTc. After acquisition of a projection image of the both phantoms, profiles were generated perpendicular to the direction of each phantom, followed by deconvolution of the tube response profile. The results obtained with both techniques closely matched. The tube filled with 81mKr revealed a slightly decreased resolution, probably due to the higher energy of the emitted photons. We conclude that extended sources may be used for resolution measurements as long as an appropriate deconvolution can be applied. ",

The present discussion about low dose effects increases the importance of those systems. Additionally to 4 NaI(TI) detectors a low efficiency Ge-detector (31%) was used for spectroscopy. Our investigations should evaluate, whether the low efficiency system is able to determine the body activity and allows a practical correction method for geomelry of this single detector model. Furthermore the influence of multiple nuclides on the minimal detectable activity (MDA) is discussed. Measurements with the detector are acquired by bottle-phantoms (4...90 kg) filled with Tc-99m, 1-131, T1-201 , and through scatterphantoms with point sources. After the determination of the calibration factors (CF) in single nuclide solutions, we calculated the changes of the MDA by various activity concentrations for different radionuclides. The graphs of the CF's as a function of body weight (m= 50...90 kg) show an energy constant (60 keV -400 keV) and a finear relation. After con'ection for the normalized emission rate a regular standardized equation was found: CF = -0.01om+2.4 [10-4 cts/soBq] r = -0.96 (I-131); -0.98 (Tc-99m); -0.99 ( T1-201) The calculation of body activity can be done with a simple measurement of the CF,by the described device. Additionally, the dependence of the CF and MDA from different activity concentrations in nuclide mixtures is demonstrated. Our results describe a correction function for geometry in a single detector system. The good correlation (r~0.98) gives a reliable value for energy and weight correction. The Ge-detector offers advantages in the simultanous detection of multiple nuclides compared to the great influence of compton effects in NaI-cristals. At least, low incorporation levels (ca. 100 Bq) of mainly used radionuclides in nuclear medicine can be ascertained. Accreditation and certification are a means of objectively recognizing compliance with quality standards. Before implementation of such a system, quality standards must be defined and accepted within the health care system. A 3-year project is in progress in the Netherlands to establish practical and feasible standards for 20 different hospital departments. This is coordinated by an external body (Centre for Medical Teehnology-TNO). The standards have been developed using formal methods based on the ISO 9000 series and modelled after the Guide to Accreditation of Canadian Health Care Facilities. Eight hospitals (4 teaching and 4 general spread throughout the country) were initially involved. Inter and intra-organizational relations and procedural processes within each department were described using flow charts that showed the links between processes, intermediate results, cheeks, decisions, and actions. These were then transcribed into draft standards. The flow charts were then examined and modified by the equivalent departments in the other 7 hospitals, and the standards amended. For nuclear medicine these standards apply to the organlzatlomd structure, staffing, faellltles, purchase and storage of materials, radiopharmaeeutical preparation, quality control and servicing of equipment, all sequences of activities eoneernlng a patient study, training, and quality assurance evaluation. In the final project stage to be completed in 1993, the draft standards will be nationally assessed and verified in the field to assure general couseusus. They will then assume official status for implementation into a nationwide accreditation system.. Where data is lacking, either an educated guess or a small scale experiment can be made, to fill the gaps. This results in global optimization, better insight in the factors that influence quality and optimal use of quality control resources. This technique was applied successfully for the 125-Ifibrlnogen uptake test, resulting in a threefold reduction in injected dose, better criteria for the reference point and for diagnosis, a better calibration procedure and formal criteria for equipment performance. It is concluded that system analysis is a powerfull method that can be a valuable Q.A tool.

Measured uniformities for the point sources were (no S) 1.42%(Tc)/1.66%(Co) and 1.66%(Tc)/1.49%(Co) (with S); for the flat Co-source we obtained 1.72%. Camera zooming decreased uniformity to 2.69%(Tc)/2.53% (Co) (no S) and 2.42%(Tc)/2.52%(Co) (with S); for the flat field we obtained 2.87%.

To enable the categorisation of results according to normal and specific abnormal patterns, the selection of suitable patient studies must satisfy well defined clinical and non-radionuclide test criteria. The Cardiac Working Group of the European COST 132 project, in association with the Cardiac Task Group of the EANM and the Working Group on Nuclear Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology, has developed selection protocols for the creation of a software phantom data base of normal studies and three typical patterns of cardiac disease: recent transmuml myocardial infarction, isolated myocardial ischaemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy. These include criteria for the interpretatiou of qualitative and quantitative nonradionuelide data. The radionuclidc studies encompass rest and exercise myocardial perfusion studies (planar, SPECT) using T1-201 and Tc-99m MIBI, and rest gated blood pool studies. The methods for data acquisition are defined. For each software phantom a unique portfolio is established. This contains all of the patient's data, anonymity being assured. For each software phantom, compliance of data with the selection criteria will pass review by an international team. The quantitative radionuelide parameters to be assessed have also been proposed. A preliminary study is underway to investigate the problems and logistics of distributing radionuelide studies in Interfile format between a range of computers and institutes, and to ascertain the statistical procedures necessary for analysis of the range of quantitative results to be expected.",

In this paper we describe a prototype environment developed around applications in nuclear medicine, using general purpose UNIX workstations, the X window system and the C++ language. Nuclear medicine imposes specific constraints on image processing systems: although the 2D image sizes are smaller (64*64 to 512\"512) than typical radiological images, they often come in time series or as 3D volumes. Furthermore, sophisticated processing techniques such as 3D reconstructions or temporal Fourier analysis are routinely performed. Most image processing tasks require interaction, and are performed in real time, including 3D visualization. Decomposing tasks into relatively small cooperating, but independent programs is a software implementation of the way nuclear medicine specialists interact with their data: integrated facilities which support multiple views on images, curves, regions of interest and related data, simultaneously, combined with flexible tools to operate on the data. We have chosen to develop the prototype environment on UNIX workstations, as UNIX provides innovative tools such as the X window system, which are hardware independent. C++ allows object oriented programming without losing the efficiency and portability of C. The X window system was used to implement the graphical user interface because it is a network transparent graphical environment. The prototype environment is based on the use of NFS for the distributed data access, on the Allegro toolkit for distributed data processing and on the InterViews toolkit for building the user interface under X. The NIH class library has been used to implement high level data structures and support mechanisms.

It permits a quick design of new interfaces without debbuging problems. An object database could be created enabling the development of user visual standards. The registration of images from different modalities (in particular SPECT, MR and CT), and at different times, is an important clinical tool to relate function, the evolution of functional change, with anatomy. A clinical area of considerable interest is that of the localization of regions of abnormal function in children with epilepsy where nuclear medicine techniques permit the observation of both ictal and inter-ictal information. Four methods have been investigated: the use of external markers, the use of internal markers, matching of surfaces using the 'cap-hat' algorithm and matching using principal axes. For children, the use of external markers has been found to be inconvenient, and the definition of internal markers manually is time consuming, or, if automatic, unreliable. The use of principal axes gives excellent results with normal function and anatomy but can fail when large defects are present. The 'cap-hat' method must be carefully tailored to avoid local minima, and a multi-resolution technique has been devised starting with a very coarse image progressing to pixel level (fine) information to local minima which is still reasonably efficient. It has been necessary to devise strategies to accommodate defects in the (normally functional) image to eliminate bias in the matching process. Symmetry provides a powerful tool for the detection of such defects. A 'belt and braces' method is proposed combining the use of internal markers, principal axes (to establish a good starting point) and the multi-resolution 'cap-hat' to refine the registration. The technique has been applied to brain images of epileptic children at various ages undergoing HMPAO SPECT, MRI (and MRS), and in many cases CT. While the clinical value of this technique remains to be proven, trials have been performed on phantoms (<2mm) and patients to assess accuracy of registration. ,MicroDELTA-M~xDELTA ''~ system, with the host computer \"~LicroVAX iI ''~ (10 ~ CPU, 450 Mb Winchester disk, 95 Mb streamer magtape) supports the data processing from 6 gamma cameras, located at 6 nuclear medicine departments in our Institute. The disadvantage of the system is that storing the data from 6 \"MicroDELTA\" computer workstations rapidly occupies the memory spaee on the host computer's hard disk. Tne purpose of the developed program (\"DEC\") is to enable tne controlled periodical storage of the \"raw\" imaging data through the local workstations at particular departments. Tne program was written in DCL (Digital Command Language) under the \"VMS v. 4.5 '#-~ operating system, enabling the software data storage to be controlled by interactive users at local workstations. The program assum_es that users will DOCument the \"raw\" imaging data, which means to prepare the images for their transfer to the subdirectories inaccessible by the \"unauthorized\" local user.

With this method, the count data are acquired at each pixel by using three windows: a main window centered at photopeak energy and two subwindows on both sides of the main window. The scattered photons included in the main window are estimated as a trapezoidal region shaped by the counts of the subwindows and the width of the main window. By subtracting the count of those photons from that acquired with the main window, the count of the primary photon can be estimated for each pixel, and then quantitative SPECT image was recoustructed by filtered backproject\u00b1on, followed by Chan attenuation correction using a map of attenuation coefficinets obtained by X-CT.

Identification and quantitative evaluation of the task-specific rCBF changes was based on an exponential ranking algorithm that uses automatically drawn regions of interest (ROIs) at a 30% isocontour of the maximal pixel value in the subtraction images. The threshold rank of 0.98 was validated on subtraction images of a cylindrical phantom containing a background compartment with low 18F activity and six spheres of different size filled with a ten times higher 18F activity. Localization of the task-specific rCBF changes was performed by retrospective spatial alignment and integrated display of PET and highresolution magnetic resonance (MR) images. In-plane PET/MR alignment was accurate with an average residual misfit of 2.3 mm as determined by a further phantom study. The specific rCBF increases measured with [150]-butanol in six subjects undergoing unilateral manual exploration were identified accurately in the contralateral motor, premotor, and sensory cortex and with high quantitative and anatomical precision. Several questions arise in clinical practice when using such a method even for small organs. This work concerns some of them, using Monte Carlo simulations and real phantoms.",

Three dimensional (3D) image presentation is a modality which became recently available in nuclear medicine. To achieve reasonable processing times, powerful computers need to be employed. However, the presentation of a complete SPECT data set in one image promises a couple of advantages. We employed an Odyssey computer system (Picker Int.) for constructing three dimensional images. 3D SPECT data were analyzed for MIBI myocardium studies, haemangioma studies, brain examinations (HMPAO, IOMAZENIL), kidney imaging, lung studies and in a variety of bone scans. This paper will discuss the optimization of 313 image presentation and image processing such as the overlay of two 3D images in order to achieve precise spatial correlation. The value of 3D images for the different diagnostic procedures will be discussed in respect to the suspected finding. Results: 3D image presentation provides directly the recognition of hot spots in correlation to organ surfaces. Cold lesions can be easily detected if they reach the organ surface. Cold lesions within organs can only be visualized with more refined data processing. The extend of a lesion is clearly recognized in 3D images and the same holds for its relation to anatomic structures. And finally, 3D images may be helpful for presenting the data to referring surgeons. The aim of this study is to validate a method useful in clinical routine to express brain uptake per cm 3 in percent of the injected dose. For patient studies, four point sources of 5p.Ci(185Bq) Tc-99m are made by pipetting 5 pl of a I mCi/ml (37MBq/ml) solution on a hardly absorbing paper and dried. The point sources with a diameter of 3 mm and prepared in 10 rain are fixed on the orbito-meatal axis of each patient before performing the HMPAO SPECT study using a three detector system (Trionix Triad) .",

Overestimation of the activity was observed at low source activity and short acquisition time using a HR fan-beam collimator. Excluding these acquisitions the ratio was 1.00 SD 0.06 for the HR fan-beam and 1. To validate a new method for the analysis of gastric emptying involving linearization of the stomach, followed by the generation of eompressed images and tlme-loeation eurves, a phantom was designed and constructed. The basic design included options for: variable motion (of the phantom), variable attenuation and scatter, peristaltic movements of the stomach with variable amplitude and speed. The underlying assumption of the time-location curves was that transit times obtained using time-location curves more truly reflected the passage of food than classical timeactivity curves. It was therefore required to design a phantom that would allow verification of this assumption. For this verification, the testmeal was replaced by a semifluid eonsisting of tiny spheres in which only one sphere was labeled. ",

Contrast enhancement is obtained by removing the irrelevant out-of-source signals and keeping unchanged the source information. Linear filtering methods are inadequate for such a purpose, since all the pixels are processed in the same way. Thus, a non-linear approach is required. For discriminating the two different populations, i.e. source and out-of-source pixels, usual planar photopeak data is insufficient to perform non-linear filtering. A third dimension is at least required and no other one than the energy axis seems to be useful. Thus, acquisition of all the energy information can be performed either by list-mode or frame-mode. The ROI method is used to define an o u t -o f -s o u r c e vector using the p h o t o p e a k image. A theoretical normalized source vector is also defined under some very straightforward physical considerations. The energy series are then projected u s i n g these two vectors, leading to a non-linear filtered image. Planar physical phantoms and clinical data using 99mTc tracer are processed by this simple method. Resulting images and contrast measurements are presented. Guidelines are suggested for t h e choice of the theoretical source vector when using various tracers. Assuming energy acquisition facilities are available, the algorithm is very easy to implement, requires a few computer time processing and is effective whatever the tracer used.

To overcome these problems, a new method was developed iu which the stomach is \"linearised\" in all frames after correction for scatter, attenuation and motion. From the lincarised frames compressed ima{ges are obtained. The compressed images for each phase are corrected for activity outside the field of view, counts lost during motion correction and decay. Time-location curves are obtained by calculating for each timeslot the heigth (y-axis) that was passed by a certain percentage of the activity ingested. The difference in time between arrival at the stomach and departure from it using the 50 % time-location curve is the transit time. This transit time is a true transit time without any need for curve fitting or other indirect parameter extraction. Results using both old and new methods are given for normals and patients.",

This paper presents a method and and error analysis for the quantitation of CBF with ~O-Butanol. Using a PET camera PC4096-15WB and an automatic blood measuring system cerebral tissue and arterial blood data were recorded in 1 sec intervals for 3 min after intravenous injection of 1500 MBq 1nO-Butanol. From the dynamic PET data one single frame of 40 sec containing all 15 image planes and a time-activity curve related to a representative brain plane were derived. Based on these data CBF was quantified in two steps: Using the common single-compartment model, time-activity curves of tissue and blood were fitted to estimate the partition coefficent p, the time delay ~ t between these curves and a constant DC used for the dispersion correction of the blood curve. With these data a look-up table was calculated to relate the pixels of the 40 sec 1nO-Butanol-image to regional CBF values. Furthermore, the influence of different model parameters on the calculated CBF data was examined. Fitted global CBF and p ranged from 45 to 70 ml/(min 100g) and from 0.55 to 0.8, .respectively. Regional CBF ranged up to 250 ml/(min 100g), The quality of the curve fit was primarily sensitive to the dispersion correction. Variations in fitted CBF und p values were directly related to calibration errors between PET and blood measuring system. An underestimation of p (e.g. 0.5 instead of 0.77) resulted in considerably higher regional CBF data. The described method of quantifying CBF is time-efficient.

To examine if this hypothesis is valid also for the regional glucose utilization, five healthy volunteers were investigated with [l-llc We found that global CMRglc falls 5-10 % below global CMRO2.In a scatter plot of rCMRglc versus rCMRO 2 the values are grouped around a straight line with slope less than i. Accordingly, the rCMRglcmmaps have somewhat less contrast than the rCMRO2-maps. This deviation may be explained by one or more of the following reasons. This study was designed to determine the optimal time frame and analytical procedure for the measurement of regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCMRglc) in human subjects with PET and [18F]FDG. We established a time interval during which effects of product loss remain insignificant and a lower time limit consistent with acceptable errors due to incomplete equilibration of tissue pool and errors due to inaccuracies in the kinetic model and rate constants.

An unambiguous biochemical interpretation of this compartment is not offered up to now. It may either be called an activated state of the amino acid after the membrane passage, or may be a trigger function on the transport mechanism itself. Although our model fits the measured values excellently, more biochemical investigations on the uptake mechanism are necessary. ",

            "text": "With the development of dynamic quantitative clinical studies, particularly in PET, the practice of compartmental modelling is widely spreading. However the numerical identification of the parameters is still questionable. Estimation quality depends on the reliability of the optimization method, which is the critical part of the solving process. A simulation study was carried out to compare the practical performance of 5 currently available algorithms : Marquardt, Quasi-Newton, Powell (issued from Harwell library), Simplex, and the one used by the program SAAM. It was designed to study the hepatic receptor-binding of GalactosyI-Albumin. One linear and 3 saturation models were generated with respectively 3, 3, 4 and 5 compartments, and 2 experimental time-activity curves. Three signal-to-noise ratios were ~ considered, leading to a set of 180 noisy curves for each configuration. An adaptive Monte-Carlo method searched parameter initial values, satisfying successively narrow and large a priori defined bounds. These values were then provided to the 5 minimization algorithms. Simulation results obtained on SUN SPARC workstation enabled the comparison of the 5 algorithms in terms of : -quality of fitting (values of the parameters, correlation of the residuals, sensitivity and identifiability of the parameters), -execution time. For instance, using the first model, which is structurally identifiable, all the methods are efficient, except Powell whose accuracy decreases as soon as noise and initial values uncertainty increase. Therefore, an estimation strategy is suggested according to the chosen model and the related experimental conditions. ",

Because measured input functions usually are significantly delayed with respect to the true influx a determination of the time shift is called for. Our aim was the derivation of an algorithm which allows for a fast, reliable and sensitive way of determining this delay. We present a transformation of the model equation which achieves this goal: In our representation the LCBF and the corresponding distribution volume are simply given as y-intercept and x-intercept of a straight line y(x)=a+bx. We demonstrate that one observes strong deviations from the expected linear behaviour when the measured input function is delayed with respect to the true one. This enables an unambiguos determination of the delay by means of a fast one-dimensional least squares minimization. The described procedure has been in use at our institute for some months and is well suited for clinical applications where a stable method and the option for a quick check of the correct performance of the system is needed.",

            "text": "A MODEL FOR DESCRIBING AND ANALYSING THE IMAGE UNDERSTANDING PROCESS. This paper will propose a model for describing and analysing the exploration process by which, given a particular task, an observer extracts all relevant information out of an image. It is based on the experimental finding that an image professional (such as a photographer, an art critic or a radiologist) extracts more and more rapidly objective information, out of an image than an untrained observer, and that one can therefore learn how to look at images with the aim of extracting information. Learning implies a possible methodology, which in turn implies a model of the elements which influence the understanding/learning process. In medical imaging, the training seems mostly based on experience, which is often equivalent to trial and error. This may be a proven method with good results, but in a specific medical area, one may try to avoid errors, as well as speed up the training period by means of an optimized methodology. This is what we hope to achieve in following this proposed model. The model is based on a sequential flow of information between conceptual modules, in which the flow induces information loss. Training should aim at reducing this information loss. The model is also based on the assumption that maximal information is extracted by looking to discover (exploration), rather than by looking to recognize (pattern matching). It consists of 6 modules and associated information flow: from transducer for pictorial presentation to perception/observation, with influences of technical and perceptual nature; from perception/observation to representation/classification with influences of conceptual nature; from representation/classification to integration of non-pictorial information with influences of a-priori knowledge; from integration of non-pictorial information to personal interpretation with cultural and psychological influences; and from personal interpretation to cognition with influences of the intellectual capacity of the observer. The different modules and the interactions between the modules will be illustrated by means of pictorial examples, and a possible methodology for training will be deduced. Material and methods: The biokinetics of Tc-99m-DMSA was studied in four infants, (between 2 weeks and 6.5 m o n t h s old), undergoing routine scintigraphy. Anterior and posterior gamma camera images were acquired at 20 rain, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 24 h p.i. Urine was collected during 24 hours. The activity in various organs was quantified using conjugate counting. Results: The maximal kidney uptake (8-9 h p.i.), the initial uptake in the liver and the activity excreted via urine during 24 hours are shown below (all corrected for physical decay). % of inj. acfivityll 2 weeks I 1.5 month 3 months 16. was introduced as an appropriate PET-tracer for cerebral blood flow (CBF). Although it is used in various laboratories, no data about the radiation dose to the patient have been published. Therefore, we extended the diagnostic CBF-studies to determine the radiation dose to the patient. Studies of neuronal activation were performed as sequences of up to 6 PET-scans while applying various stimuli. For each scan about 1500 MBq 1sO-Butanol were intravenously injected. All measurements were done using a whole body PET-camera PC4096-15WB. For each cBFstudy PET data were recorded for 3 min. In each patient one cerebral scan was extended to 14 rain to monitor the tracer activity in the brain for 7 half-lives. Directly after the last scan the patient's bed was moved, and measurements over different organs, e.g. the liver, were performed for another 10rain. Based on the measurements in 8 patients time-activity curves were obtained, from which the accumulated activity and the radiation dose were calculated. The liver received the highest radiation dose of about 2.5 mGy per 1500 MBq of injected t50-Butanol.",

            "text": "The dose to the kidneys was 1.3 mGy, to the stomach 1 mGy, to the brain 0.16 mGy and to the total body 0.18 mGy. These data do differ from the dose caused by tnO-water, which is commonly applied for PET-CBF-studies. Whereas the latter tracer has similar doses to all organs of about 3 mGy for a whole study with 6 scans, a liver dose of about 15 mGy must be considered when using t~O-Butanol. The human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line CEM was established as a subcutaneous growing tumor in the CD1 nude mice and served as tumor xenograft model for leukemia treatment with antibody-radioimmunoconjugates. The aim was to evaluate by immunoscintigraphy the in 'vivo binding of the cytotoxic CD7 T-cell antibody TH 69, which demonstrates already non radiolabeled significant tumor cytotoxity. The antibody was labeled with 1-131 via the Jodogen method using 74 MBq of 1-131. After labeling the 1-131 bound antibody was seperated from free iodine by submitting the antibody solution to a 10 ml sephadex G-10 column. Those fractions which contained the labeled antibody were then combined for latter application. Normally 6.5 MBq J-131 were injected i.v. into the tumor bearing mice. Scans were obtained until day 10 p.i. using a pinhole collimator. Organ preparation and activity measurement was performed on day 11. High specific activities in the lungs (9.30%/g) and the iliacal lymphnodes (10.97%/g) were found. Histological examination ruled out tumor metastasis in these organs. So this only could be caused from complement induced tumor lysis and accumulation of immunoconjugates in the local lymptmodes and in the lungs. Nevertheless the tumor could easily be localized by gamma camei'a imaging and although unspecific transport of immunoconjugates a specific activity of 7.5%/g could be detected in the tumor mass. In conclusion non radiolabeled TH-69 is very effective in the therapy of T-cell lymphomas and in refractory cases 1-131 labeled TH-69 will improve the success of tumor therapy. It has been shown !hat 1231-Granuloszint (ab47) is a useful tool to detect hidden infections with SPET. However, the unsatisfactory supply with this nuclide should be eliminated by developing the 99mTc labelled ab47 ~mTc-Granuloszint). The now developed prototype of a Tc-kit (single step labelling) consists of a derivative ab47, namely a tetraaza-ligand coupled with an amide bond to the free amines of ab47 and tin tartrate. After the addition of pertechnetate and a simple filtration process to eliminate colloidal Tc by-products, the 99mTc-Granuloszint is ready for injection. The comparison of scintigrams obtained with ab47 labelled with the two mentioned nuclides did not show significant differences, but a clear difference in the elimination from blood was observed. An interesting result was obtained by analysing the excreted urine. Paper chromatography showed about 70% of the excreted activity at the same P~ value as the 9emTc-tetraaza-complex, the rest being mainly pertechnetate and small amounts of unidentified by-products. In the case of 1231 the excreted activity was found at the Rf value of iodide. The radiation dose to all organs including the liver is reduced in the case of 99~Tc-Granuloszint, which is mainly due to the shorter half-life of 99rnTc. Successful imaging of neuroreceptors in vivo depends on the ability of the tracer to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), to bind with high affinity to the receptor, and to exhibit low nonspecific binding. In vitro assays have shown doxepin (DOX) to have a higher affinity to the histamine H1 receptors than pyrilamine (PYR) (Kd DOX = 0.02 nM; Kd PYR = 1.0 nM). C-11 DOX and C-11 PYR were prepared from their normethyl precursors by N-rnethylation using C-11 iodomethane. Male CD-1 mice, weighing 20-30 g, were injected intravenously with 0.2 ml (200-300 ~Ci) of either C-11 DOX or C-11 PYR. At different times after injection, the regional radioactivity distribution in the brain, as well as the uptake in various other organs was determined.",

Highest C-11 DOX concentrations were found in cortical areas, whereas highest C-11 PYR concentrations occurred in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. Preinjection of unlabeled DOX (up to 10 mg/kg) did not inhibit C-11 DOX binding in any of the regions.

Arterial blood gas analysis was performed prior to the intravenous injection of the tracer. The brain activity concentrations were measured using SPECT at 40 rain after injection. The arterial input (AI, t~Ci*min/ml) of each tracer was measured with arterial sampling and rapid octanol extraction. During the first 3 min after injection, the ratio of diffusible to total circulating radioactivity resulted significantly higher (up to 25%) for ECD than HMPAO. The AI values were referred to the injected dose and resulted 0.029 __. 0.009 % and 0.024 -t-0.05 % (mean _ SD), respectively for HMPAO and ECD: these values were significantly different (P<0.001).

These experiments are being extended to autoradiographic investigations of the radionuclide distribution within the interstitial and spermatogenic cells. Practical information on radiation protectiou measures for general personnel is lacking. Especially the risk for internal eontamination and the build up of background radiation levels are hard to predict. We devised practical suidelines, and tested them prospectively during two clinical trials where 125-I (1 -2.5 MBq per patient) was used. The guidelines were modelled after those for the nursing of patients contaminated with pathogens resistant to multiple antlbioties. Only the nurses were instructed. A quality control prosram was set up, resulting in data on the oeeurenee of contaminations and the recovery of the radioiiodine. Over a period of several months, involving 3 wards and more than 100 personnel and 60 patients, the measured recovery (excluding estimates of unmeasured, but known losses) never fell below 90%. Currently our cumulative experience totals 370 patients on 5 wards, 3 intensive eare units and more than 200 personnel. The highest concentrations found in waste never exceeded 750 kBq/l. No contamination exceeded 40 kBq and all contaminations above the detection treshold of 1 Bq/em2 were visible. No build-up of background levels occurred. No detectable thyroid uptake was found in the 20 persons most exposed. As we consider the waste routing of 125I in this ease representative for most isotopes, it is concluded that radioactive excreta and other waste can be safely handled by general nurses using our guidelines. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is the most important commission in radiation protection worldwide. It publishes recommendations, which have great influence on the national legislations. Therefore the revision of the famous publication No.26 was expected with great interest. In 1991 it now has been issued as publication No.60. This paper reports about the main changes, which in brief are the following: The risk coefficients have been magnified by a factor of 4 according to new findings in the biological effects of ionizing radiation. A new classification for the tissue weighting factors has been introduced and the radiation weighting factors have been altered. One of the most important changes is the reduction of the dose limits: The \"public\" limit is now 1 mSv per year and the \"occupational\" limit is 20 mSv per year, averaged over defined periods of 5 years. Unfortunately and this gives rise to criticism the dose limits have not been defined depending on age. The ICRP Publication No.60 will be of considerable effect on all future national and international regulations and therefore is of greatest interest for everyone who is involved in radiation protection. The investigation of bone-seeking 9gents is one of the firsts and constant works in Nuclear Medicine, with three stages: I, Experimental: studies about metabolism Ca-P. II, Scintlgraphy: studies of tumoral disease with nuclldes non adequate. III, Phosphate complexes: that has made bone scintigraphy in an excellent procedure to study skeletal pathology. Thank its contributions, the bone scan is necessary in daily clinic, and in addition, has helped to the development of radlopharmacological and instrumentation in Nuclear Medicine. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Based in our experience (2700 bone sc~]/year), we have analyzed the utility of bone scan, clinlcal demand, frequency, positivity and sensitivitv,in various pathol.ogical groups: Metastasis (300 pa%lents), primary mal\u00b1gnant tumours (80 pts.), osteomyelitis (50 pts.), ~ethological hip (i00 pts.) and Paget's disease (50 p%s.). In all groups, we have analyzed the differents techniques: bone scan, WBBS, vascular, quantification, and the indications. RESULTS: Metastasis: early diagnosis, 30-50% lesions detected before radiology. Primary malignant tumours, index positivity high (96-100%), the bone scan are useful to: local extension, detection of metastasis, and to assess the response to therapy. Osteomyelitis: early diagnosis before radiological visualization. Pathological hip: diagnosis of synovitis, and avascufar necrosis femoral head; detection of prostheses complications: loosening and infection. Paget's: the scintigraphic pattern is characterist, and of utility in diagnosis extension grade of act\u00b1vity and treatment evaluat{on.",

Obtained pictures were estimated according to 4 steps picture intensity scale, established by comparison of tracer accumulation around the hip prosthesis and in an iliac ala. For precise analysis of isotope location in the area of interest \"contourgraphic technique\" was applied by X-ray picture overlaping on the nanocolloid gammagram. Scintigraphic results of 30 patients were verified by subsequent surgery and the rest of results -by clinical, radiological and bacteriological exami nation.

Serial three phase bone scans were applied to 25 paraplegics (22 men and 3 women, mean age: 34 ~ 12.5) under the risk of myositis ossificans (MO) once every three weeks for a period of 3 months, beginning with the onset of paraplegia. Simultaneous serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), serum calcium (SC) and urine calcium (UC) levels were measured and radiographic correlations were made. If an evidence of MO was determined on any of the tests, the frequency of the tests were increased to once every two weeks. The patients were followed for a mean period of 14 weeks (range: 12-17 weeks) after the onset of paraplegia. Four patients were diagnosed by three-phase bone scans before any development of a radiographically detectable abnormality. The earliest radiographic detection of MO in these patients occurred after 3 weeks of radionuclide positivity. Three patients had both scintigraphic and radiographic evidence of MO at the time of detection and the rest did not develop MO within the follow-up period. SALP levels were found to be elevated in 3 of the 7 patients a week after the scintigraphic detection of MO . Four patients with high SALP levels did not show any evidence of MO either scintigraphically or radiographically. The SC and UC levels remained in the normal range regardless of high SALP levels or the presence of MO. We concluded that, three-phase Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy is a valuable diagnostic tool in the early diagnosis of MO which is important in terms of proflactic interventions. Stress fractures could happen on healthy bones in case of excessive mechanical stimulation, and particularly during sport practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interest of bone scintigraphy in patients whose Physician's suspected a stress fracture and ask us to confn'm or to infirm their diagnosis. Spontaneous fractures occuring on fragilized bones (ost6oporosis,tumours) were excluded from this study.17 young adults(mean age=28 years, 11 male and 6 females) were explored. They received an injection of 15 mCi (555 MEq) of Tc99m-m6thyldne diphosphonate. The vascular phase was studied on anterior incidence, late images(3 hours post-injection) were performed in anterior and posterior incidences, and sometimes with profile when necessary for a better visualization. Twelve stress fractures were confirmed later by clinical evolution and delayed appearance of radiological signs, such as localised cortical thickening~ Mean age of these patients was 23 years. Localisations found were seven tibias, four fibulas and one metatarsis. Three patients had only a periostitis(evidenced on profile incidence). One case with an aggravation of clinical symptomas, was histologically identified as a bone metastasis of a lung cancer. The last case correspond to an osteonecrosis of the cuboid (higher signal on T2weighted MR image). This study did not involve any false negative, but five false positives of whom three were corrected by profile incidence(periostitis). It is one of the weaknesses of this exploration, related to its high sensitivity. The more difficult diagnosis to elimine remain ostdonecrosis or algoneurodystrophy. Tumours happen in different context and are more easy to eliminate. In conclusion, bone scintigraphy, because of its high sensitivity, may have an important contribution in early diagnosis of stress fracture and help for elimination of others diagnosis. ",

MRI was performed with two magnet systems: a 0.5 T superconductive and a 0.2 T permanent, recording Tl-and T2-weighted images (Spin-Echo sequences) for the anatomical localization of the fracture. TPB images, performed after i.v. injection of 555 MBq of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate, permited a functional valutation of the fracture from the evidence of lesion intensities. When present (nine patients), the areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI images correspond to the increased uptake of radionuclide in angiography TPB images, tardive TPB images seemed to be more extensive. Both TPB and MRI were sensitive and specific in detecting clinically suspected fractures. With TPB, highly sensitive, it is possible to have early diagnostic informations and to compare lesion intensities, while MRI, highly specific, better defines anatomic lesion sites in the cortical bone and in the bone marrow. Further experiences are needed to determine diagnostical findings in the follow-up of the occult fracture. We wanted to evaluate if a high resolution SPECT of the spine is advocated in oncological patients, with a normal planar bone scintigraphy and without complaints. Our patient showed, one year after the initial treatment, a rise of CA 15.3. The patient had no complaints and the staging could not reveal clear evidence of metastasis. Although on the planar bone sointigraphy the thoracic and lumbar spine were considered normal, an additional evaluation of the spine, was performed by means of MRI, and SPECT images after the injection of Tc-99m MDP as well as after the injection of Tc-99m monoclonal antibodies (BW 250/183). The tomographic acquisitions of the spine were in both cases obtained on a three headed high resolution SPECT system (TRIAD 88, TRIONIX) equipped with high resolution collimators. Forthy views/head of 30 seconds each were taken, resulting in a total acquisition time of 23 minutes. The acquisition images (matrix of 128 x 64) were reconstructed into a 64 x 64 matrix using a filterred backprojection. On the bone marrow high resolution SPECT images multiple cold lesions were found in the the thoracic and lumbar spine. These cold lesions could be superimposed on the multiple small areas of increased bone metabolism, seen on the bone SPECT images and considered as occul| metastasis. MRI also confirmed these findings and a planar bone scintigraphy taken six weeks later, clearly showed these lesions. Although planar bone scintigraphy still remains the examination of choice in the detection of bone metastasis, small lesions may be overlooked due to the overlying and the underlying activity. However these occult metastasis can be identified on high resolution SPECT images. In practice when the planar bone images are doubtful, it seems to be advocated to perform high resolution tom0graphy rather than additional planar images.",

In this study tracerkimetic investigations were applied to diagnose bone metabolism in pati L ents on regular dialysis treatment. Studies were performed on e4 dialysis patients (? male, i? female) with different extent of secondary hyperparathyreoidism (HPT). Parameters of calcium metabolism e.g. intestinal absorption, whole body retention, flux rates on the basis of a catenary compartmental model ~ere evaluated by means of a t~in isotope technique (~SCa p.o., 9?Ca i.v.). After tetracycline labelling bone biopsies ~ere taken from the ilian crest. Additionally, biochemical parameters were determined e.g. intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), AP, Ca, and Vitamin D metabolites ~5 HCC and i.~5 DHCC. Data show elevated iPHT in ~/~4 patients. However~ bone histology showed low turnover osteopathy (LTO) in 7 patients and high turnover osteopathy (HTO) in 8 patients whereas 9 patients presented with mixed formes (MUO). HTO was always associated with an increased calcium efflu\u00d7 and high normal Ca-retention. By contrast, patients with LTO had diminished Ca-eff]ux and evident low Ca retention and 7/9 patients with MUO normal values of Ca-efflux and only slightly decreased Ca-retention. Calciumkinetic investigations are a useful t0ol for the evaluation of bone turnover which is closely correlated with bone morphometric estimation. Therefore, underlying forms of osteopathy are well to be differentiated by changes in internal calcium fluxes. The aim of this study is to present the interest of \"pin hole\" scintigraphy of chronic post-traumatic wrist pain. \"Twenty five patients,15-52 years old, were studied with normal (3rd hour) (SN) and pin-hole (SPH) bone scintigraphy. Results were compared with findings of X-rays (25 cases), MRI (17 cases), Computed -Tomography (2 cases) and Open Surgery (8 cases) which were considered as the gold standard. Thirteen patients had osseous or ligament lesions of the wrist, 2 had Kienb6ck's disease, 6 had non union of the scaphoid with 2 avascular necroses of proximal splinter. In four cases no lesion was detected. Of the 13 patients with osseous or ligament lesions, SN was positive in 7 cases, SPH in 12. In only one case, SN and SPH were normal and arthroscanography showed adhesive capsulitis. In KienNSck's disease, SN showed a diffuse hyperfixation of the wrist and SPH demonstrated the absence of fixation of the Lunatum. In the 2 cases of avascular necroses of the proximal splinter (established by surgery), there was a defect of fixation of this fragment on SPH and this was correlated with MRI. In the 4 cases without osteonecroses (established by surgery), SPH showed an equal or decreasing fixation of the proximal fragment, highlighting the vitality of proximal splinter. In these cases there were 2 false positive identifications with MRI. In the 4 cases without lesion of the wrist, SN and SPH were normal. Diagnostic contribution of pin-hole scintigraphy in chronic posttraumatic wrist pain is better than standard scintigaphy. Pin-hole scintigraphy is more specific than MRI in the diagnostic of avascular necroses of proximal splinter i'n non-union of the scaphoid. Despite advanced automation of bone edge detection and region of interest positioning in spine and femur measurements of bone mineral with modern instruments operator review, and at times manual override, is required to correct for errors in bone edge detection. The threshold to trigger manual intervention by the operator is subject to different interpretations. The purpose of this study was to create guidelines based on pattern recognition to standardize such operator interventions between laboratories. Results are based on experience of two multicenter studies with over 10,000 spine and hip measurenP_nts of BND performed with D~A*.Results: (i) 8-15% of all L-spine and 12-27% of all hip scans needed operator intervention depending on technologist training. (2) For L-spine eight patterns are shown demonstrating different levels of inhomogeneity in B~K) distribution, scoliosis, long axis rotation, degenerative disease and compression fractures. Other patterns show artifacts frcrn patient movement, garments, intestinal content and poorly absorbed medication. ",

After 24 hours the skeleton scanning was repeated with HIG foloowing the same procedure. In 17 pts no changes were observed on the static images while 3T was within the range from 0.18 to 0.41. In 16 pts scintigraphy with HDP showed on static images increased accumulation in the skelet of affected hip adjoining to the endoprothesis; 3T was within 0.62 and 0.88 implying increased perfusion of the surrounding tissue. The images obtained with HIG showed no increased accumulation; In 14 pts, the static images obtaindwith HDP as well as HIG showed indreased accumulation. 3T ranged from 0.90 up to 1.55 which evidenced extraordinarily increased perfusion~;6f the sur~ound~ng~tissue.

It appears to be a promissing tool for noninvasive screening of CAD. 22 patients (5 females, 17 males, mean age 52+/-10 yrs, range 37-72 yrs) with single-vessel (LAD) coronary disease were investigated by means of dipyddamole (DIP) stress 201-T1 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, using SPECT, 1 week before and 2-5 weeks after coronary by-pass surgery (CBS)..The dose of DIP was 0.56 mg/kg, and the injected activity of 201-T1 was 2 mCi. Before surgery, after completion of the stress -3-hr rest imaging, a further 1 mCi of 201-T1 was injected. 10 min and 1 hr later, repeated SPECT acquisitions were performed. SPECT images were evaluated both subjectively and semiquantitatively, using a 4-grade segmental defect score system, with higher scores for more severe perfusion defects.",

The metabolism of this compound in the heart muscle is believed to end mainly with 4-iodobenzoic acid as the final product of B-oxidation. By using IPPA as a reference for the investigation of the metabolic fate of chemically modified fatty acids with the Langendorff rat heart we could not confirm the formation of 4-iodobenzoic acid as a main product, It merely appeared as side product in minute concentrations. As proved by FAB-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) the main heart catabolite of IPPA is 4-iodocinnamic acid, with 3-(4'-iodophenyl)propanoic acid, and 5-(4'-iodophenyl)-3-hydroxypentanoic acid as side products. Additionally a surprising metabolite was isolated from hydrolysed heart lipids. Besides IPPA 11-(4-iodophenyl)undecanoic acid was detected and proved by FAB-MS. The formation of a single metabolite is possibly due to the consumption of catabolites by fatty acid synthetase in the cytosol. This result points to an additional metabolic loop of IPPA, which may be important for the interpretation of sequential scintigraphy. In a prospective study of 26 patients (pts) with first Q wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI), infarct-avid imaging and radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) were performed after injection of Tc-99m (740 MBq) labelled antimyosin (Tc-AM) within 72 hrs of chest pain. The early blood pool phase of Tc-AM was utilised for equilibrium RNV in the 3 standard views. Planar images for the detection of myocardial necrosis were obtained earlier and at 24 hrs in the same 3 views. Images were evaluated blind by two experienced physicians. Myocardial antimyosin uptake was seen in 21 out of 26 pts (81%). RNV was evaluated in 19 out of 21 pts with positive uptake of antimyosin. Mean\u00b1+SD left ventricular ejection fraction was 42\u00b19% (range 25%-59%). Wall motion abnormality (WMA) was present in all the 19 pts and this matched with the location of antimyosin uptake. However. 7 pts (47%) showed WMA extending beyond the area of antimyosin uptake which may represent stunned or hibernating myocardium. In a further 4 pts (21%), the extent of antimyosin uptake exceeded the area of WMA, which may suggest myocardial viability in the area of injury. This data suggests that using a single dose of Tc-99m antimyosin, simultaneous assessment of LV function and delineation of the extent and location of myocardial necrosis may be achieved, improving prognostic evaluation in patients withAMI.",

For patients who have had an infarction the standard method of detecting residual myocardial ischemia, including silent ischemia, is the exercise stress test. The aim of this study was to determine diagnostic and prognostic value of exercise stress test (EST), 24-hour Holter monitoring (H) and quantitative scintigraphy. All the three tests were performed 2-4 months following the acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The study included 74 asymptomatic patients (pts) after the AMI. The patients were divided into two groups by results of scintigraphy: Group I -44 pts with silent ischemia, Group II -30 pts without ischemia. In Group I, out of 44 pts, 9 had a positive EST, 4 showed a painless ST depression on Holter and 7 had both tests positive, whereas 24 pts had only scintigraphy positive. In Group II one patient had positive EST and Holter. Coronary arteriography was performed in 33 pts. The diagnostic value of these methods was assessed by Bayes' Theorem. During the follow-up period lasting at least 12 months, in Group I 3 pts died, 1 developed a new myocardial infarction and 15 pts had painful ischemic occurrences. In Group II only 3 pts developed symptoms of angina pectoris. Thallium scintigraphy was the only non-invasive test showing significant correlation with the follow-up outcomes. The diagnostic and prognostic superiority of thallium scintigraphy may indicate its value as a potential screening method for asymptomatic patients after the AMI. Holter did not show any additional contribution in relation to EST. Resulter Fourteen out of 3b patients (39X) had TI strses defects. Ot tOO segments 25 (13~) had grade 0 or i Tl uptake.

This investigation was undertaken to elucidate the clinical significances of myocardial imaging with BMIPP and MIBG in HCM by measuring the total myocardial uptake rate (tMUR) in the planar images and the regional washout rate (rWOR) in the SPECT ones, comparing to those of T1-201 chloride (TL). In 9 patients (pts) with HCM (BMIPP), and in 18 pts with HCM and 7 normals (MIBG), myocardial scintigraphy was perfumed at 15 min and 5 hr after iv injection of the tracers at rest. The tMUR of BMIPP in HCM was 4.04_+0.72%ID (n=9), which was significantly lower than that of MIBG (5.09+1.89(n=18)) and of TL (6.75+2.21(n=9))(p<0.01). In the SPECT images, the myocardium was divided to 9 segments on the Bull's-eye display and classified into 3 groups according to TL uptake (low (L), middle (M) and high (H)). The rWORs of BMIPP in HCM were 17.75+8.63% (n=14) (L), 21.13-+8.52 (n=52) (M) and 25.89_-_+6.91 (n=15) (H) (L<H, p<0.01), while those of MIBG were 36.69+11.95 (n=21) (L), 26.85+17.79 (n=128) (M) and 26.01+11.41 (n=22) (H) (L>M, L>H, p<0.01), and were significantly higher than of the normals in the all segments of myocardium. These results suggested that the fatty acid metabolism in HCM might be impaired only in the high TL uptake segments, although the sympathetic dysfunction would be spread over the all segments of myocardium. We concluded that myocardial imaging with BMIPP and MIBG was a promising tool for the assessment of pathophysiology in HCM. We investigate the prognostic importance of thallium perfusion defects in hypertensive patients without significant angiographic coronary disease. 16 consecutive patients (pts) with these findings were followed up for a mean of 49 months (range 32-64 months).",

Two tomographic acquisitions were performed: 1) the phantom being centered with laser beams, 2) the phantom in the same position, but the gantry was moved 5cm apart. The radius of rotation was the same for the 2 acquisitions. The acquisitions (high resolution parallel hole collimator = 6.5mm at 10cm in air, pixel size: 4.2ram) were performed as follows = centered phantom: 64 steps over 360 \u00b0 (matrix format 64*64); non-centered phantom: 32 steps over 1800 (same matrix format). A standard software (Hamming-Hann filter) was used for reconstruction. The data of the centered acquisition was reconstructed using both 64 and 32 projections. Defects size were measured (null value of the second derivative of a profile across the defect) on a 256*256 reconstructed matrix. Results (in mm): The results suggest that centering the patient's heart is determinant for the assessement of the size of small perfusion defects.

In 17 pts with WPW, aged from 16 to 65 years' old (<age>=37+16), gated blood pool angiography was performed with red blood cells labeled in rive with 1 mg of stannous pyrophosphate and 740 MBq (20 mCi) of sSmTcO~ \". One study with 24 frames per cycle, was acquired in left anterior oblique view, during 400 cardiac cycles, using a lowenergy-general-purpose collimator and a Gamma-Camera 400 AC linked to a computer Starcam 2000. It was caleulatsd the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and phase analysis (PH) was used to study the regional motility and to localize the site of earliest phase in the left ventricle (L), septum (S) or right ventricle (R). The time elapsed between the activation of the first two ventricular areas was also calculated. The 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG) of these pts was analyzed in order to give the same information. All pts but one, with EF=45%, had a normal left ventricular systolic function (<EF>=62+9%). None had significant regional wall motion abnormalities. The following accessory pathways were identified by PH: 2 L, 8 S and 7 R. These results were concordant with the ECG study in all pts, although only partially in 10, meaning S versus contiguous free ventricular wall (L or R). The PH postulated the presence of multiple AP in 3 pts, not detected by ECG. The PH can thus have the advantage of permitting to identify multiple AP, not suspected by ECG in the absence of tachycardia. According to these results, both PH and ECG seem to be useful and complementary before invasive studies of pte with WPW. However, it was not possible to detect a valid parameter for identification of high risk pts due to short ref~'actory periods, established by clinical criteria.",

Prevalence of myocarditis in this serie is concordant with previous histologic studies. 4P6 Since the value of Tc-99m sestaMIBI is known and a~c~pted in the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), the aim of this study was to define its value in identifying the different vascular territories on patients (pts) with angiographically d~cumeated CAD. A consecutive series of 55 pts was studied, all of them went through coronary angiography which showed at least one significant coronary lesion (> 50%) in a main vessel (1 vessel disease-18 prs; 2 vd-18 pts; 3 vd-19 pts). The history and ECG of 35 pts were compatible with previous infarction. Scimigraphic studies carried ont 0x rest and after myocardial stress (treadmill in 43 and after Dipiridamol in 12) were processed with SPECT mid a segmental amdysis was made by w/rich the different segments were assigned to the three main vascular territorins. In pts with previous infarction, the concordance between the necrosis area shown by the ECG and the respective scintigraphy was :analysed. The Sensitivity, Specificity-, Predictive value and Accuracy-estimate of the me~hod in idantifying the different vascular territories were ~ased on concordance or discordance between the result of sci~igraphy and aagiogt-aphy. RESULTS: Only one scnitigrapMc study was completely-normal In 94.2% of the pts with previous infarction, a concordance was found between the scintigraphy and the necrosis area revealed by the ECG. In 18 pts without history or ECG compar.ible with previous inferction, fixed perfusioa defects were detected, which corresponded in 1,\u00a2 pts (77.8%) to a vascular territory depending o~ coronary-atzery with significant stenoses. CONCLUSION: 1. The Tc-99m MIBI with SPECT shows a high diagnostic accuracy to segmant~l identification of CAD and it is the highest concerning significant steanses in anterior descending artery. 2. The presence of fixed perfusion defects in the population studied is very ltigh. As the presence of myocardial necrosis was excluded by medical history and ECG, evidence of fixed perfusdon defect was related, in the present series, to significant coronary srenosis in more than 3~4 of the pts, which gives rise to the problem of myocardial viability-diagnosis with this kind of radiophermacearica[.

After mantle field radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, the incidence of myocardial abnormalities remains controversial. Twenty five asymptomatic patients (11 males, 14 females, mean age: 35 years) were studied 7 years (range: [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] after radiotherapy. Thallium SPECT data were obtained 5rain after exercise (at least 85% of the predicted maximal heart rate), 4hours later and at rest (1 week later). Images were analyzed visually and quantitatively (sectorial analysis of bull's eye images of short axis slices) compared to those of 35 subjects with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease. ECG exercise testing was normal in all the patients. Images were visually abnormal in 21 patients (84%) showing an heterogenons T1 uptake. In 60% of the patients, T1 uptake (in at least one sector) was lower than the mean T1 uptake value measured in subjects with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease. Redistribution was present in 9 patients. In 2 patients, the resting images demonstrated a \"filling-in\" of a 4hours defect. In most of the patients, the location and the shape of the defect(s) does not seem be related to an epicardial coronary vessel stenosis. Thus, after mediastinal radiotherapy, T1 myocardial uptake is frequently abnormal. The observed pattern suggest a disease of the small coronary vessels and/or the existence of a myocardial fibrosis rather than a disease of large epicardial coronary vessel. ",

            "text": "The identification of ischemic but viable myocardium by thallium exercise scintigraphy is often imprecise, since many exercise perfusion defects do not improve on images 4 hours after redistribution. Aim. The purpose of the study was to determine reliability of detection of viable myocardium by imaging early after injection at rest by comparing these results with 24 hours redistribution images. Methods. Scintigraphy was performed 20-40 minutes after T1-201 injection at rest and 24 hours after exercise, in 44 patients (29 after MI) with defects on exercise thallium imaging 4 hours after injection. Results. Thallium uptake was seen in 55% of defects , seen 4 h after exercise on 24 h redistribution images. Uptake early after injection at rest was present in 51%, in two patients 24 h redistribution was not present. Concordance between both methods was 87%~ Viable myocardium was demonstrated in S2% of segments supplied by coronary artery with 75-99% stenosis, and in 48% of segments with total occlusion. Conclusions. Injection of thallium at rest and imaging soon after injection can reliably demonstrate viable but ischemic myocardium. This was the case even in the subgroup of patients surviving myocardial infarction. Experimental data show that heterogeneous sympathetic innervation of the heart is expected to result in asynchronous myocardial contraction.To examine a possible relation between sympathetic denervation post myocardial infarction (MI) and l e f t ventricular asynchrony, 18 male pts post MI (55\u00b113 years old)with one-vessel disease were examined. Tl-201 SPECT at rest was used to assess necrosis and 123I-MIBG to assess denervation. Polar maps of TI-201 and L231-MIBG were generated. In all pts z23I--MIBG defect was larger than  indicating denervation outside the infarcted area. Difference of 1231-MIBG and Tl-201 defects was estimated as % of total polar map and located.Gated blood pool scanning was performed within one week.Fourier phase images (color-coded phase display) were used for detection of phase disturbances in regions outside the infarction, related to the locations of denervated but perfused myocardium.9/18 pts presented abnormal phase display in areas outside MI and related to the location of MIBG/TI mismatch.ln these pts mismatch was 21\u00b111% while in 9 pts with normal phase display outside MI mismatch was 11\u00b19% (p<O.05). In 5/9 pts with abnormal phase mismatch was >20% while in 2/9 pts with normal phase mismatch was >20%. In conclusion:l) Pts pMI present denervation outside infarct area, frequently related to abnormal phase display in denervated but perfused area. 2) Larger MIBG/TI mismatches are frequently associated with abnormal phase display. Dobutamine TI-201 scintigraphy appears to bea useful method for evaluating coronary artery disease butits accuracy in detecting residual ischemia in post myocardial infarction (MI) patients (pts) receiving antianginal therapy is unknown. 16 pts (12 male, 4 female) 56\u00b114 years old, with recent (<3 months) MI were examined by SPECT for detection of ischemia in infarct zone and at distance; extent of disease was known by coronary angiography. B-blockers were administered in 7/16 pts, nitrates in 10/16 and calcium antagonists in 5/16 pts. IV dobutamine was infused in graded doses to a maximum of 40 Ng/kg/min. Coronary angiography revealed 24 diseased vessels (diameter reduction >50%); 16/24 were infarct related vessels and 8/24 supplied segments at distance. Heart rate rose from 65\u00b110 to 97\u00b121/sec and blood pressure From 135\u00b121 to 160\u00b123 mmHg. Angina presented in 5/16 pts and ST depression >1 mm in 3/16 pts.lschemia in infarct zone was detected in 12/16 pts; in 8 of them ischemia was detected only after reinjection. [schemia at distance was disclosed in 4/8 segments. 4 diseased vessels at distance were not detected;3/4 were left circumflex coronary artery, In conclusion: i) Dobutamine Tl-201 SPECT can frequently detect ischemia in infarct zone and at distance in post MI pts receiving antianginal therapy.2) Reinjection frequently is necessary to detect ischemia in infarct zone. In addition to the amount of irreversibly damaged myocardium, the critical factor influencing long-term prognosis following acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the degree and extent of residual ischemia. In a series of 43 patients (pts) with a first Q wave MI (19 anterior; 24 inferior), left ventricular firstpass ejection fraction (LVEF) and myocardial perfusion tomoscintigraphy were obtained with . Patients were studied 13+4 days after the acute event at rest and at maximal symptom-limited bicycle exercise: 3 pts had chest pain, 10 pts had >-lmm ST segment change, 21 pts had exercise induced wall motion abnormalities and a > 5% decrease in LVEF, and 30 pts had exercise induced perfusion defects involving either the infarcted territory (15 pts) or a remote territory (15 pts).",

The clinical question were mainly suspicion diagnosis of CAD (n=20), follow-up under conservative run (n=12) or after invasive intervention (n=9). Scans were performed with the PET ECAT 951 (Siemens).1.85 GBq S2Rb were administered before and 3 min after Dipyddamol-infusion (0.56 mg/kg over 4 rain). Usually static scans were acquired over 6 min, in special cases dynamic sequences were taken. Including a follow-up observation of 30 rain the total procedure lasted about 90 rain ( 60-150min) . No adverse reactions were seen. Because of claustrophobia, 3 patients had to be treated with Diazepam. The daily load was between 3 and 6 patients. Despite of scout scans sometimes parts of the antedor and inferior myocardium were not completely mapped. After an initial adaption phase the 82Rb-generator was running smoothly. System restarts were somewhat frequent (6 times), sometimes during acquisition, however, all exams could be completed. Reorientated slices of 1.2 cm thickness were computed. Without 3-Dsmoothing of the transmission scan severe image artefacts were observed, which, at times, strongly affected the evaluation. Image documentation was done with absolute and relative intensity scale on Xray film. Diagnosis was performed on the basis of these images. An increase of myocardial blood flow after Dipyridamol-infusion was observed in 24 of 39 analyzed studies, relative decreases after Dipy. (ischemia) were found in 4 patients, constant flow decreases (infarction) in 11 cases. In opposite of the easy and safe use of fhe Rb-generator, the available software used for the exam has to be optimized. Compared to the SPET (2O~TI-or ~9mTc-MIBI) no improvement of the clinical results were seen when using the 82Rb-PET equiped with the standard software. This study examined the results of dobutamine (DOB) stress testing with evaluation of cardiac and non cardiac side effects in ii0 consecutive patients suspected of having coronary aruery disease (CAD) and in 49 other ones with a history of recent or previous myocardial infarction (112 males and 47 females; mean age 57, range 41 -70 years) .",

The purpose of this study was: (1) to develop a set of profiles of normal distribution of planar Tc-SESTAMIBI obtained from 20 male healthy volunteers, and (2) to study the results of quantitative analysis (QA) with a modified background algorithm to estimate the risk of CAD in 14 pts with normal coronary a~leries and in 46 pts with CAD and to compare the results with visual analysis. Univariate analysis of variables used during visual (v) and mean and maximal (Q) circumferential profiles in terms of Odds ratios. Our data indicate that processing on the basis of the maximal count profile resulted in a better prediction of the presence of CAD and diagnostic accuracy is significantly increased with combined visual/quantitative analysis (stepwise likelihood-ratio statistic: p=0,014). Brewerton (1985) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We used gated radionuclide ventriculography (GRNV) to assess abnormalities in diastolic function in a group of AS patients without valvular disease. Method: 30 AS patients were studied with GRNV at rest and during upright bicycle exercise. The control group consisted of 30 matched healthy subjects. Mathematical procedures developed by our team were used to measure the following parameters of the activity-time curve under both conditions: ejection fraction (EF), peak filling rate (PFR), time of PFR (TPFR) and time of isovol~metric relaxation (TIVR). Student's t test was used in the statistical analysis. Results: No significant differences between the two groups were found in heart rate at rest or during~ effort. PFR at rest and during exercise was lower in AS patients than in control (2.0 + _ 0.6 vs 1.6 + 0.5, p< 0.05 at rest; 2.7 + 0.6 _ _ vs 2.3 ~ 0.7, p < 0.05 during submaximal exercice). No significant differences between patients and control were found in TPFR or TIVR under either conditions Conclusion: Evidence of an alteration in rapid ventricular filling was found at rest and during effort in AS patients; this change was probably due to an increase in myocardial reticulin. The aim of this work was to assess the value of gated single photon emission tomography (Gated-SPECT). 12 patients (7 men, 5 women, age= 63 + 13.8 years) were studied by Gated-SPECT and biplane ventriculography (BV) . Red cells were labeled with 740 MBq of Tc99m by the in vivo technique. Sixteen gated frames were acquired at 32 angles over a 180 \u00b0 rotation (left posterior oblique to fight anterior oblique). After reconstruction and reorientation, quantitative analysis was performed. From five slices (3 short-axis sli~es, a vertical long-axis slice and a transversal long-axis slice at the mid-ventricular level), septal, anterior, lateral, and inferior walls were studied at apical, median and basal levels. An apical segment has been added leading to the examination of 13 segments. Regional ejection fraction with background correction (EF) or without background correction (NEF), phase difference between the regional phase and the mean phase calculated from the whole slice (Phdiff) were calculated for all segments. From the BV, 125 segments were classified as normal with E F -66.12 + 16.6 %; NEF= 44.28 + 13.72 %, Phdiff= 0.18 + 8.81 \u00b0 . When studying normal segment according to their anatomical location, EF, NEF and Phdiff were not found to be different from one segment to the other. 31 segments were considered as abnormal : EF=47.83 + 1 9 . 7 1 % ~<.001), NEF= 27.7 +13.97 % (p<.001), Phdiff= 3.87 +_ 11.03 (NS). Phase analysis does not seem to be a sensitive method to detect wall motion abnormalities. The differentiation between normal and abnormal segmems evaluated by regional ejection fraction is not dependent on background correction. Gated-SPECT seems a promising technique to assess the regional ventricular function. systolic and diastglic function after maximal exercise in R hypertensive (AH), coronary artery disease (CAD) patients (pts) and in a group of healthy individuals (H). 22 pts with AH (aged S4 \u00b1 7 yrs), 24 with CAD (SS\u00b1S yrs) and 20 H (52\u00b114 yrs) were studied. All patients underwent rest and stress radionuclide ventriculography, with additional imaging 5, I0, 20, 30 min after exercise.

The sensitivity using T1-201 varies widely and results as high as 100% or as low as 42% are reported. Tc-Sestamibi might be advantageous because of its physical and biological properties including its high mitochondrial concentration. A dual isotope substraction technique using Sestamibi minus iodine might therefore improve the sensitivity for parathyroid adenoma detection. We compared scintigraphy in the preoperative localization of parathyroid adenoma in 7 patients presenting a biological pattern of hyperparathyroidism (group A). Seven patients without hyperparathyroidism were studied using Tc-99m Sestamibi/I-123 only as a control group (group B). Two patients with cold thyroid nodule were studied before surgery (group C).

IRC was accumulated in SR+ organs and in tumors, followed by a rapid clearance from these tissues, with specific uptake (untreated vs treated, %dose/g), 0.5 and 4 hr p.i., but not 24 hr p.i. In this study we could not visualize tumors by y-camera scintigraphy despite specific uptake in the isolated tumor(0.23 \u00b1 0.07 vs 0.11 \u00b1 0.02; p<0.001), 0.5 hr p.i. and (0.20 \u00b1 0.05 vs 0.08 \u00b1 0.02; p(0.001), 4 hr p.i. This is in contrast with the positive visualization of the tumor by y-camera scintigraphy in similar experiments using T30 (Bakker et El, J Nucl Med 1990; 31:1501 -1509 . In another study with normal rats we compared T30 and IRC by isolating several SR+ organs 4 hr p.i. Uptake was similar (IRC vs T30) for the adrenal glands (0.23 \u00b1 0.08 vs 0.23 \u00b1 0.07), but significantly higher for T30 in the pancreas (1.03 \u00b1 0.15 vs 0.21 \u00b1 0.05; p<0.001) and in the pituitary gland (0.32 \u00b1 0.09 vs 0.07 \u00b1 0.01; p<0.001). The higher remaining radioactivity in all organs analyzed (i.e. blood, liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs) with IRC indicates a higher background radioactivity. Experiments in the isolated perfused rat liver showed a rapid uptake of IRC and T30 in the: liver. The radioactivity excreted in the bile in the IRC-experiments was mainly not peptide-bound, while the T30-experiments showed more and intact T30, this indicates a lysosomal pathway for IRC. Conclusions: IRC did not have the expected potentials as a radiopharma-ceutical like T30 although there are differences in relative uptake in different organs. The main reason is the low tumor/background ratio of IBC. The primary hyperparathyroidism is most often developed by the adenoma of this Bland.The determination of PTH level itself is not sufficient to issue the decision of surgical treatment. In order to indicate precisely the site of surgery it is necessary to visualize the parathyroid glands.",

They also underwent scintigraphy with subtraction method using a ZLC Digitrac Siemens scinticamera connected to a Microdelta computer. The examinations were carried out in two stages: with the use of 201 thallium and then with Sestamibi (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) labelled with 99m technetium. All 9 patients underwent then surgeries. Histopathological exams confirmed in all the patients the existence of adenoma in two parathyroid glands. The precision of adenoma localization was then evaluated. It was found that in four patients the CT diagnosis was COrDect, while in 6 patients the correct diagnosis was obtained with scintigraphy using thallium, and in as many as in 8 of ? pa tients, the scintigraphy using Sestamibi gave positive results. Our results show, that parathyroid adenoma may be also visualized by use of Sestamibi -99m Tc.

During the first year of treatment we observed a progressive rise in IGF-I and growth velocity in all of the subjects. Growth velocity at 12 months was S.47 ~ 1.36 am/year (p< 0.O1 vs basal values) and .64 ~ 20.45 ng/ml (p< 0.01).

In the present study, diagnostic accuracy of 5 different imaging diagnostic techniques were compared in 36 consecutive HPT-patients (pts) : 27 with primary HPT (I-HPT) and 9 with secondary HPT (II-HPT). Diagnostic techniques consisted of: double tracer scimigraphies both with T1201/Tc99m (VrS) and with MIBI-Tc99m/Tc99m (MTS), NE with a 10 MHh-probe, CT and MR. All pts were studied with MTS, \"ITS, NE and CT whereas the last 16 pts also with MR. A total of 65 pathologic PG were surgically removed; 11 of them were found in ectopic sites (retropharingcal, retroesophageal or mediastinal PG). Surgical and histological findings were taken as gold standard. Sensitivity (SE) and false positive (FP) cases in pts with I-HPT are shown in the table below.

Combination of MTS plus TI\"S and NE showed the beat diagnostic accuracy (SE = 96.7%). In cases with ectopic PG, MTS showed a higher SE (85.7%) in comparison with NE or TC or MR (71.4%), and with TTS (42.8%). Less enthusiastic results were obtained in II-HPT: SE resulted 67.6% with NE, 50% with MTS or TTS, 47% with CT or MR. These data demonstrate a good diagnostic accuracy of MTS in I-HPT. Thus, this diagnostic technique should be widely introduced in the preoperative study of pathologic PG.",

In a randomized order, half of them (12) ingested 380, 500 and 660 ml of regular and/or sparkling water. The second half (12) ingested 500 ml of sweetened water (water + orange juice, 84 Kcal/l). All the preparations were labelled with Tc-99m Rhenium colloids. Setting the volunteers in a i/2-dorsal decubitus, we performed the gastric scintigraphies in LAO over a 30 mn period. We measured the EI by a 6-electrode epigastrograph (London Medical Electonics). The GE half-time is given in the following table related to the type and/or volume of liquid studied as well as the correlation ratio (r) resulting from the two measurement procedures: 0,62 0,54 0,78 0,84 0,78 0,78 0,90 NO matter of the nature or the volume of liquids ingested, the EI provided reproductible results well correlated to the Sc. However, we noticed that the times given by El have been the half of those given by Sc. These datas are logically due to the fact that the volume and the gastric morphology are modified during GE, and from this modification results the exit of the area explored by the electrodes.

We retrospectively reviewed the HEF of 38 patients (pts) with biliary-enteric anastomosis, preoperatively and with postoperative follow-up within 1 year (n=19), then up to 2 years (n=9) and to 3 and 4 years (n=4 each), and to 5 years (n=2). Number of postoperative HIDA-scans: 1 (5 pts), 2 (19 pts), 3-11 (17 pts) . We wanted to assess the diagnostic value of HEF in the two most frequent complications: cholangitie and recurrent stenosis, and to quantify the liver function after operative relief of the obstruction. Method: After injection of 2-6 mCi of 99mTc-iodida (Solco) dynamic acquisition was performed during 1 hour (30-60 sac/frame, Matrix 64 x 64, word mode), data were analysed with NucLear software. The Impulse Response Function (IRF) was given by deconvolution of the time activity curves obtained from ROI over the heart (input function) and the right upper liver lobe. The HEF was calculated es the ratio of the back extrapolated Y-intercept of the IRF monoexponential fit to the IRF maximum data point. Results: HEF was normal or slightly diminished (> 80 _< 100%) in cholangitis as well as in obstruction, in 2 cases of obstruction the HEF was strongly diminished (20% and 60%). These cases normalized after relief of the stenosis. Except 2 patients, a preoperatively diminished HI:F improved or was normalized after operation, even in case of biliary fibrosis/cirrhosis and long standing obstruction. These findings were confirmed by liver function tests (aminopyrine breath test and galactose elimination capacity), Conclusions: HEF cannot safely differentiate between cholangitis and recurrent obstruction. HEF can be strongly reduced in hepatocellular as well as in obstructive disease. But HEF is a very sensitive parameter in the follow-up evaluation of liver function after relief of an obstruction.",

Overt liver metastases were found in 34 pts undergoing laparotomy, and 26 had elevated HPI values (76,4%). No apparent liver metastases were found in the remaining 113 pts submitted to a \"curative\" resection of the primary tumonr.These pts were followed up by periodic clinical examination,hepatic ultrasonography and CT scans. At one year of follow-up 64 pts were evaluated.Seven pts developed liver metastases, six had initial elevated HPI values and one had a norton[ initial value. Fifty-seven pts did not developed liver metastases, 36 had elevated initial HPI values and 28 had normal HPI values. RESULTS:These data result in a sensitivity of 76,9% and a specificity of 43,3% for DHS and a predictive value for a positive HPI of 16,7% at one year~ and a predictive value for a negative HPI of 96,4%.CONCLUSION:These results showed that although initial elevated HPI values did not identify high risk group of pts prone to develop liver metastases, pts with initial normal HPI values have a confirmed low risk of developing liver met,%stases.

            "text": "As there is a close relationship between the results of sclntigraphy and the presence of somatostatin receptors in the tumors scintigraphy means an in vivo-demonstration of the receptor-status. It has to be proven whether apart from the detection of the tumor, this t~chnique can be used to predict the effect of treatment with Octreotide. Duodeno-gastric Reflux is an often postoperatory complication in patients who had gastrectomy. The symptoms are various. We studied 20 patients (8 males and 12 females). All of them had undergone a surgical operation on stomach, 14 had symptoms and 6 were asymptomatic. All of them were assesed by endoscopy. Method The patient must be fasting for 3-~ hours before the examination. With the patient in supine position and the collimator over the abdominal area 5mCi 99m-Tc-HIDA injected i.v.. Sequentfal views of 120 sec are taken for 15 minutes. 100-150 ml of milk was administered orally 20 min. after the i.v. injection. Finally, a small quantity (200 uCi) of 99mTc pertechnetate in 100 ml of ware9 was administered orally to outline the stomach area. Results From the 14 symptomatic patients 9 had a typical Duodenogastric reflux radiopharmaceutical imaging in the stomach.The other five symptomatic patients with no imaging in the stomach had a long time imaging of common bile duct and delayed passage of radiopharmaceutical to the duodenum and probably this was the reason of their s21~ptomatology. Two of the asymptomatic patients had a low grade of duodeno-gastric reflux. Conclusions Hepatobilliary scanning with Tc-99m HIDA is a excellent low risk high diagnostic value examination of Duodenogastric Reflux in patients after gastrectomy. To ascertain ileal localization, 24 patients with proved active Crohn's disease (CDAI > 150) underwent In-III-WBC scintiqraphy, celon-ileoscopy and small bowel enema. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients (7 with terminal ileitis, 7 with ileo-colitis and i0 with colitis only > 5trough biopsies carried out during ileoscopy and surgical specimens. In patients with active ileal disease,scin-~igraphy was positive in all cases (14 out of 14). Small bowel enema showed a pathological terminal ileum in 86% ~f cases with 14% ~ 2 out of 14 ) false negative. Endoscopy histologically confirmed disease in 50% of ca-~es only, as ileoscopy was unsuccessful in the order 50% due to inflammatory stenosis of ileo-cecal valve. ~cintigraphy showed no pathological granulocyte uptake in the ileum in any of the ten patients with Crohn's disease localized in colon. Ileoscopy confirmed normal ileal mucosa in all of them.Small ~owel enema gave a false positive pattern in 20% and normal in 60% of cases. The above shows the diagnostic usefulness of In-III-~BC bcintigraphy in ascertaining ileal active Crohn's disease and as an indispensable complement to endoscopy and radio-~ogy.",

In 46 pts the final diagnosis was established by open surgery: we found a true prositive result in 36 pts, a true negative result in 5 pts, a true negative result in 3 pts and in 1 pt a false positive result. This would mean a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 86 %.

Testing the different bleeds of various immunized animals includes interalia determination of cross reactivity using pure cross reactive analytes, at concentrations tenfold of the concentration of the desired antigen against which the antisera were raised. These pure cross reactants are extremely expensive and of very limited availability and many are obtained by pituitary fractionation in the case of glycoprotein hormones. An economic and rapid method of the cross reactivity testing is described for identification of bleeds with minimal cross reactivity. This is a modification of the antibody dilution curve used for determining the initial and final dilutions at which an antiserum is used in which progressively increasing dilutions of antiserum are incubated with a small amount of the tracer analyte. If instead of the radiolabelled analyte one substitutes the radiolabelled cross reactants one obtains similar dilution curves from which it is easy to predict the cross reactivity. These can be used in much smaller quantities than the conventional cold cross reactants. The power of the technique is illustrated by the testing of an LH antiserum developed at Agra which has proved very promising material for the National Immunodiagnostic Programme. \"Sandwich\"-immunoradiomeLric assay developed on the basi~ o\u00a3 the components merltioned includes a Lwu steps procedure.",

The validity of a unique method for the measurement of free thyroxine (FT4) serum concentration based on the use of 1251 labeled anti-T4 moncolonal antibody was evaluated in 311 euthyroids, in 177 overt or subclinical hypothyroids, in 255 overt or compensated hyperthyroids, in 100 normal pregnancies and in 10 cases suffering from FDH, Sera from 110 patients on L-T4 replacement or suppressive therapy were also assayed. Between-laboratory precision obtained in 48 assays from 4 different centers was quite appropriate for clinical use with a CV ranging from 4.6% (at 1.35 ng/dL) to 8.6% (at 0,36 ng/dL); the working range showed a CV --_10% between 0.12 ng/dL and 10 ng/dL; analytical sensitivity (CV=50%) was 0.04+0.01 ng/dL ~SD). A good correlation of FT 4 estimates was observed when data were compared with those obtained with 4 other commercial kits (r_<0.95). Euthyroid reference limits were set at 0.91-1.75 ng/dL (according to both the Youden approach and the mean+~SD values). The sensitivity of the assay in dissdminating both overt hypothyroids and hyperthyroids from control subjects was 0,95 and 0.96, respectively, As expected a low diagnostic efficiency was found in both the subclinical hypothyroids and compensated.hyperthyroids. However in the latter group the normality of FT 4 concentration agreed with the normal metabolic status of these patients, while suppressed TSH values were undistinguishable from those of the hyperthyroids. In pregnancy serum FT 4 levels decreased from early to late months of gestation. This method resulted in slightly increased serum FT4 levels in FDH subjects. In patients on L-T4 suppressive therapy FT4 concentrations appeared to be a poor indicator of their actual metabolic status. In conclusion, this multicenter trial demonstrated that this peculiar methodology, based on the use of a 1251-labeled anti-T4 MoAb, is simple, rapid, quite precise, reliable and minimally dependent on abnormal T4carrier proteins.

We optimized the conditions of the chelation e.g. concentration of reactants, pH, time and temperature. The 25-mer nucleotide sequence for histone4-mRNA was modified by coupling with aminohexyl group (AHON) and conjugated with DTPAisothiocyanate (1/10); 50 ~g of DTPAAHON were chelated with 37-370 MBq (1-10 mCi) of I n q l l chloride with high specific activity (30-100 #Ci/~g) and labeling efficiency (60-80)%. Incubation of In-DTPAAHON with whole blood (dog, pig and human) for 5 min indicated (95~+2)% retention by cell-pellet and sequence of binding affinity per million cells was leukocytes > > platelets > red cells. In-DTPAAHON was stable in plasma and indicated high permeability, cellular extraction and retention; 0.1 ~g/ml of In-DPTAAHON was found optimal for cell-labeling. The blood-clearance (5X) of In-DTPAAHON in Beagle dogs resulted in clearance of (75+6)% with a T,~. of (420+30) hours; 5 Yorkshire pigs were sacrificed for biodistribution at 3 hours after injection; (78\u00b18)% of injected dose was in blood, (11+__3)% in lung, (6__+1)% in liver, (1.1_+0.2)% in lddneys and (11+2)% in muscle.

Marker values were determined retrospectively in 175 serum samples of 10 breast cancer patients, that have been sampled from the time of the i n i t i a l diagnostic (stage I I I or IV); the patients were selected to include those who developed recurrence and were monitored for 8 months to 5 years (median time: 25 months; 6-25 samples per patient ). Low concentration of the .two groups of markers was associated with stable disease or remission; progressive disease was associated with increase of CEA: 5/10; \u00a2A-15-3: 9/10; CA~125 : 2/3; TPA: 9/10 and TPS: 9/10. In 7/10 cases, markers showed a evident increase several months prior the clinical diagnosis of relapse. In 4/7 cases, TPA and TPS increased more precociously than the tumor mass markers. During therapy monitoring, TPS and TPA levels followed the increase or decrease of CA 15-3 and/or CEA levels in 8/10 cases. Moreover, TPA or TPS reacted much faster than the tumor mass markers to indicate response to therapy. I t was concluded that trends in marker concentrations showed a good cgrrelation with the clinical status and that a combination of markers assaying both tumor mass and tumor proliferative a c t i v i t y provided the best method for a more effective monitoring of breast cancer patients. Besides the steroid receptor status, several new, potentially, independent, biological, prognostic factors have been proposed. One of these promising factors is Cathcpsin D, a lysosomal protein, which belongs to the family of proteascs. It has been shown to be a marker of tumor invasiveness, and its measurements in cytosolic extracts of primary human breast tumors may particularly be of prognostic use for breast cancer. The primary objectives of the present multicentrie study are to evaluate the clinical significance of Cathepsin D and laboratory performance of its determinations. According to the standardization and external quality control sebeme, under the anspiees of EORTC Receptor Steroid Group, the nine participating centres have achieved these results: a) between-assay = 13%; b) within-assay = 10%. Regarding the 1552 cases' data, the main preliminary results are summarized as follows: a) Cathepsin D levels have shown in all cases no correlation with lymphonodal and menopausal status; b) besides, it was not sigulficantly correlated with receptor status in premenopausal Neases; c) however, it showed a correlation in post menopausal patients (p = 0.002) with N+ (p = 0.52). In conclusion, assays of Catbepsin D in tumor eytosol provide valuable prognostic informations for breast cancer patients with nodal involvment at the time of diagnosis.

            "text": "We conclude that in the follow up of patients with non metastatic prostate cancer treated by hormonotherapy, bone scan scintigraphy can be only indicated when P S A level overcomes more than i00 ng/ml, reducing a high number of bone scan uselessly indicated. Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) with Tc-99m labelled anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) 225.28S is currently used to detect uveal melanoma particularly in presence of opaque ocular media. However, a low tumoral uptake and a high non specific background activity in the nasopharyngeal region make it difficult to detect small size melanomas and tumors located in the nasal quadrant of the eye. To overcome this drawback we evalueted the RIS with 3-step IN BREAST  TUMORS  BY  IN  VITRO  QUANTITATIVE  AUTORADIOGRAPHY USING IODINE-125 BC-2 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY. Tenascin (TN) is a stromal glycoprotein expressed in breast cancer, while it is not in normal breast. TN is recognized by a murine IgGl: To detect and measure TN in 20 breast tumor biopsies we have performed in vitro quantitative autoradiography technique (IV-QAR) using (I-125)-labeled- . 14 consecutive sections have been cut from frozen tumors (thickness 8urn); 2 sections have been used for immunoperoxidase (IP) and 1 for H&E stainings, 11 for the saturation study of IV-QAR. In seven sections has been measured the total binding by incubation with increasing concentrations of 1-125 BC-2 (0.8 to 56.2 nanomoles/1), in other 4 the non saturable binding by pre-treatment with unlabeled BC-2 (lmg/ml) and by incubation with labeled (6.4-56.2 nmoles/l) plus unlabeled, in excess BC-2. The sections were then exposed along with sections of 1-125 standards to sensitive films. The opical densities of the standards were plotted vs. their specific activity (uCi/g) and a standard curve obtained to have the levels of BC-2 bound to the tissues. The molar content of TN was measurable in 17 cases ranging from 35 up to 300 pmoleslg; the expression was quite heterogeneous, being associated to the stroma and not to the neoplastic component. TN levels in normal breast were not measurable as well as in benign nodules. A strong positive correlation was found between TN levels and estradiol (E2) receptorial status (r=0.95) as well as a perfect agreement in the distribution of the antigen depicted by IV-QAR and IP. In three negative tumors to IV-QAR, lack of TN was also demonstrated by IP. These results indicate: TN represents a marker in breast tumors; TN is widely and heterogeneously expressed and its expression is related to the E2 status; and elevated TN levels, in primary breast tumors, justify the use of labeled BC-2 for RIS. Preliminary trials with B72.3 antibody have previously been can:led out in the USA. lmg doses of antibody were labelled with between , resulting in effective dose equivalents of up to 57mSv. In Europe administered doses are generally lower. To investigate the compromise between dose and image quality we have performed planar and SPECT imaging in two groups, each of 10 patients who received lmg of B72.3 antibody (Oncoscint CR-103) radiolabelled with either 80 or 150 MBq . SPECT data were collected in a 64 x 64 matrix using 64 incremental views of 20 seconds each through a 3600 rotation. Processing parameters were assessed using data from a hot rod phantom with target to non-target (T:NT) ratios of In-111 between 2 and 4 to 1. Optimum detection resulted by prefiltering the phantom data with a wiener filter (0.25 cut off) followed by reconstruction using a ramp filter. The smallest lesion diameters detected were 15 and 10mm at T:NT ratios of 2:1 and 4:1 respectively. Counts in the patient views increased by 65% with the increased dose resulting in images of higher quality. Overall antibody imaging demonstrated tumour sites not seen by x-ray CT in 21% patients investigated. SPECT imaging increased the confidence of tnmour detection; the clarity of tumour visualisation varied between planar, transverse and coronal views, although coronal views were especially helpful in assessing non specific bowel uptake.",

The aim of this study was to compare scintigraphy with MRI for the diagnosis of tumoral infiltration of the spinal bone marrow. Included in this study are 14 children, 7 girls and 7 boys with neuroblastoma proven through pathological biopsy evaluation. All the children presented one or more abnormalities: tumoral infiltration of the bone marrow on biopsies, hyposignal of the vertebral body on MRI, abnormal uptake of the spine on scintigraphy. In most of the cases, the amount of injected was 1 mCi ( 37 MBq ), the radiochemical purity was determined by thin layer chromatography. Using a large field gamma-camera, multiple views of the head, thorax and abdomen were obtained. The duration of each scan was 10 minutes. 11 MRI examinations were performed on a 0,5 Teela and 3 on a 1 Tesla. T1 weighted images were obtained with a repetition time ( TR ) of 250 ms and an echo time ( TE ) of 28 ms. The interval between MIBG and MRI varied from 1 to 13 days. In all cases, the primary tumor was enhanced by MIBG. In 3 cases with neuroblestoma cells found in biopsies, there was no spinal abnormality on MIBG scintigraphy and MRt. In 6 cases, diffuse spinal abnormality on MRI and MIBG scintigraphy was demonstrated. In 5 cases, a normal spinal uptake was observed using MIBG and a Iocalised abnormality using MRI was revealed \" a tumoral bone marrow was confirmed by biopsy examinations in 3 cases and the proof of a tumoral bone marrow infiltration was never obtained in 2 cases Considering it is very important to detect and to confirm a bone marrow infiltration, it was decisively indicated to perform these two explorations simultaneously. It's known that interferon (IFN) may increase the antigen expression of tu~r cells when added to cellular cultures or injected in animals bearing tumor xenograft. Rosemblum e t a ] . demonstrated that IFN a]fa can significantly enhances the uptake of 96.5 MAb by p97 rae]an~a antigen and consequently increase the tumor uptake improving radioi~unoscintlgraphy (RIS) of malignant melanoma.",

In particular nor variation of false positive results was demonstrated nor new lesions were disclosed, nor was i t possible to demonstrate enhanc(~nent of tumor uptake. PET with FDG allows the estimation of the glucose metabolism in malignant tumors during therapy. These data about metabolic changes induced by a single agent can be used to develop a metabolic designed combination therapy. This in vitro study was undertaken to measure the effects of Hexadecylph~sphocholine (HPC) on the FDG uptake in MCF7 cells and to develop an app#opriate combination therapy. The cells were treated with three different doses of HPC for 2 hours or 24 hours. The FDG Uptake was measured with '4C-FDG one and four hours after HPC therapy in glucose-free RPMI1640 medium. The radioactivity was determined using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography and the FDG uptake was expressed as nCi/well or standardized to the number of viable cells. One hour after HPC therapy a dose-dependent increase of the FDG uptakes was observed (more than 200% for the highest dose); four hours after therapy a decrease was seen. However the accumulation in treated cells in all cases was higher or similar to the control value~ Thereafter a therapy was developed using the time-and dose-dependent effects of HPC on the glu.cose metabolism. Three doses of HPC and two doses of deexyglucese (DOG: lmg/ml or 2rag/mR were given in different time schedules: HPC and DOG simultaneously (K1), HPC and one hour later DOG (K2.), HPC and four hours later DOG (K3). The cell number was determined on day 1,2 and 3 after combination therapy using a Coulter Counter. On day 1 we found an 100% improvement for all combination therapies, on day 2 and 3 only K2 and K3 showed a benefit. K2, the application of DOG during the period of strongly enhanced FDG uptake, proved to be the best combination. These data show that in vitro the development of a metabolic design of chemotherapy is possible. However the in vivo application and the benefit of this approach for patients have to be shown using PET and 'aFDG. A comparison was made with mice depleted of endogenous biotin by sequential ip injections of 500Mg of streptavidi n every 15 hours.",

The primary tumor stage was: T1, N0_l, M x. For MRI, a 1.5 Tesla whole body magnet (Philips Gyroscan) was used, and continuous coronal T1 weighted spin echo (SE) scans (5ms slice thickness) of the pelvis region were recorded. Also, sagittal T1 SE scans with 3.5 mm slice thickness of the entire spine were performed. For BMS, the Tc-99m labeled anti-granulocyte antibody (BW 250/183, Behringwerke, Frankfurt, FRG) was used. Whole body scans and single planar scans were obtained 4 hours post injection (activities: . Conventional bone scans using Tc-99m MDP were also performed in each patient. All image modalities were conducted in each patient within 3 weeks (mean). The scans of the 3 sodalities were then evaluated by two experienced (blinded) readers. Of the 21 patients studied, 16 had normal findings in all 3 sodalities. 2 patients had multiple metastases which were detectable with all 3 methods. Of these, one patient showed spine metastases on MRI and BMS which were not detected in the bone scan where only rib lesions were visible. 3 patients had unequivocal findings in one respective method which could not be confirmed by the two other. Considering the patients with doubtful findings as not positive, only 10% metastases occurred during the initial staging. The bone marrow scintigraphy seems to have a comparable sensitivity to MRI and the bone scan and it could thus be employed at the beginning of staging since the entire marrow can be visualized. Z.

Release of indium might be even more important for indium labeled preparations. We compared the tissue distribution of indium labeled and iodinated polyclonal human IgG in an infection model. We did the same for the MoAb OV-TI 3 in an ovarian carcinoma model. As infection model we used Wistar rats with a Staph. Aureus abscess of the calf muscle. As turnout model we used athymic Balb/c mice with a subcutaneously growing NIH:OVCAR-3 turnout. Indium labeling was performed via DTPA. Iodination was performed using either Iodogen (IO) or the Bolton-Hunter reagent (BH). Human polyclonal IgG was labeled with either . OV-TL 3 was used as the F(ab')2 fragment labeled with either In-111 or I-123. Plasma samples taken at 24 hr were analyzed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 . For IgG at 48 hr the abscess uptake is 1.0% I.D./g (In) and .5% I.D./g (I both IO and BH), being 95 and 55% resp. of the maximum uptake (at 6 hr. p.i.). For OV-TL 3 the turnout uptake at 48 hr is 6.0% I.DJg (In) and 4.6% I.D./g (I both IO and BH), being 85 and 81% resp. of the maximum uptake (at 6 hr). After injection of I-IgG the thyroid uptake at 48 hr is 3% I.D. (IO) and 1.5% I.D. (BH) (p<.01). After injection of I-OV-TL 3 the thyroid uptake at 48 hr is 1.8% I.D. (IO) and .05% I.D. (BH) (p<.01).

Retrospectively, 67 biopsy proven patients (males: 35, females:32, age range: 3 months to 16 years, mean: 4.5) referred for ~P and/or MIBG scans were analysed, with a total of 138 MIBG and 73 MDP scans (within 2 weeks on 63 occasions) . Results showed that MIBG detected more lesions (847) than MDP (118)o Apart from the ribs and pelvis, there was no significant difference in the distribution of the lesions detected by both agents (Chi squared test, X 2 = 84.079, p>0.88). Likewise there was no difference in the detection of lesions by the two agents in appendicular compared with axial skeleton (X2=0.063, p>0.05) o Results from the combined MDP-MIBG studies showed that although MIBG detected more lesions, it missed some (mainly in the ribs) which were detected by MDP, while those lesions detected by MIBG solely were in the spine, and pelvis. We conclude that both MDP and MIBG are complementary and both are indicated in patients with neuroblastoma. ",

The aim of this work was to report our experience and results in suspected or not metastases using 99Tcra-labelled nonspecific polyclona] Human Im-munoGlobulin (-HIG) and to evaluate and compare its applicabilit~with 99Tcm-MDP findings. Nouspecific polyclonai IgG labelled with ~Tc ra, binds according to in vitro results, to the Fc receptors of monocytes and granulocytes (17.1% and 3,3% respectively, of the total radioactivity applied). In caracter to that, radlolabelled IgG, when injected intravenously should be attracted by pathologies with increased mono-and granulocytes and thus selectively detected by scintigraphic methods. Since the pathology of osteosclerotic metastases is not characterized by an osseous inflammatory reaction (osteocellulitis) but rather by tumour emboli and tumour cell proliferation, the attempt to image bone metastases using 99Tc-HIG should not succeed, and scinfi~ra~nhi,'c findings should be negative in contrariety to the positive one of \"Tc MDP. Only bone metastases associated with osseous reactive cellulitis could give a positive 99TcraHIG scan. Method/Results: 555 MBq (15mCi) 99TcraMDP and 555 MBq (15mCi) 99Tcra-HIG were both injected to each patient, within a time interval between the two investigations of [3] [4] days. All 99TcmHIG scans performed in 58 pts with known metastases (with 99Tcra-MDP scintigraphy confirmed) were negative. is presently the only isotope of iodine used in the follow-up of patients (pts) with differentiated thyroid cancer by means of whole-body scan (WBS). Nevertheless, poor image quality, relatively high dosimetry to pts (due to unfavorable physical characteristics) and long duration of the study are the most important drawbacks encountered using this radioisotope.",

In selected patients (n=6) blood samples were taken at regular time-points and 24 hr urine was collected throughout the whole study. Chest X-ray and CT studies were used for localization of the primary tumor and metastases thereof. Tumor biopsy specimens from all patients were MOC-31 positive using immunoperoxidase staining techniques on frozen tissue sections. No adverse reactions were observed in any of these patients. Blood clearance is represented by a single compartment model with a half life of 17 hrs. The 24 hrs urine excretion varied from [2] [3] [4] [5] .5 % of the injected dose and was constant during 3 days after injection. In 8 out of 11 patients tumor or metastases Iocalizations were detected by immunoscintigraphy. Detection of metastatic tumor lesions seems better than the detection of primary tumor suggesting poor penetration into larger tumor masses of the latter. Although the group of patients used in these experiments was small, preliminary results indicate that MOC-31 may be a promising diagnostic tool for staging of small cell lung carcinoma.

This study was undertaken to determine whether this compound is a reliable marker for tumor cell proliferation dudng treatment. Three cell lines derived from an osteosercoma lung metastasis were b'eated with cispletisum and two cisplatinum containing phosphonic acids (AMDP, DADP1 The incubation tirn~ in the drug containing medium was 24 hours. For the thymidine uptake experiments the cells were pulsed with \"C-thymidine for two hours. After washing they were lysed with perchloric acid. The acidinsoluble fraction was washed again with perchbric acid. lysed in NaOH and the radioactivity in acid-seluble and acid-insoluble fractbn was determined by scintillation counting. For the acid-insoluble fraction the DNA content was determined after ethanol precipitation. The accumulation was expressed as uptake,%vell, uptake/lO0000 cell s, radk)activity in the acid-soluble fraction/lO0000 cells and radioactivity/Jg DNA. After cisplatisum and DADP the uptake/well showed an 8% increase and no change for AMDI~ The increase in uptake/lO0000 cells was more pronounced for all . However this increase was not due to thymidine lecorporatbn into DNA. since the uptake/Jg DNA decreased in all cases. Consequently the uptake in the acid-soluble fraction hcreased. This finding may be expla!ned by an increase of the thymidine kinase activity. The data were compared to the results of two-dimensional flow cytometry. A bbck in G2 phase was associated with a decrease in thymidine incorporation into DNA. In conclusion we found that the thymidine uptake in treated cells is not necessarily caused by thymidine incorporation. Therefore the valse of thymidine uptake as proliferation marker during treatment may be questionable. We performed PET studies in a rat mamary carcinoma to evaluate the effects of an experimental therapy on the glucose uptake and tumor perfusion. The drug is currently applied in a phase I clinical study. Twelve Sprague Dawley rats with a methyl-nitrose-urea (MNU) induced mammary carcinoma were studied prior to an experimental chemotherapy (100 mg/kg p,o. = group 1 with 9 animals; 200mg/kg p.o. = group 2 with 3 animals). Follow up studies were undertaken in 7 animals 24 hours and in 6 animals 7 days after therapy. The PET examination was performed after i.v. injection (jugular vein) of 1-2 mCi FDG and 10 mCi 0-15 labeled water. ]-he perfusion measurement was done during the first 5 minutes after bolus injection and the FDG uptake study was done for 60 minutes. The PET data were standardized for the injected dose and the body weight (SUV). Six animals of group 1 and one animal of group 2 could be evaluated in the follow up. The FDG uptake prior to therapy ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 SUM In group 1 a decrease in FDG and 0-15 uptake was observed in 30% of the anirnats 7 days after therapy. In group 2 two animals died due to side effects. The surviving animal showed a marked decrease in perfusion and FDG uptake 24 hours after therapy without a change in morphology. These preliminary results of our ongoing study show: 1. metabolic changes due to therapy can be measured with PET at a very early stage before morphologic changes take place, 2. the kinetics of metabolic alterations is different for different doses. Since 50% of these MNU induced tumors are ras oncogene positive, differences in response may be due to ras-induced changes in the tumor cell. This is now under research in our institute. Malignant melanoma is the most frequently encountered primary intraocular neoplasm and its early diagnosis is essential for the further treatment.0n the other hand misdiagnosis rates have been reported at between 2.5-15%. Therefore this study was done to evaluate the validity of anti-melanoma MoAb 225.285 labeled with 9SmTc as imaging agent in patients with unclear diagnosis and suspicion of the ocular melanoma. 50 patients (18 females,12 males) were studied. In all cases CT/NMR,ultrasound,fluorescein angiography and immunosclntigraphy (planar and in some cases SPECT) were performed. Gamma camera ZLC (Siemens) and mikroDelta system were used. All patients were investigated scintigraphically twice or third within g& ha.",

We used PET and O-15 labeled water for perfusion studies in patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma and melanoma. All patients were scheduled for chemotherapy using surgically implanted catheters and subcutaneous port systems. Fifteen patients (18 metastases) had a catheter in the gastroduodenal artery, while three patients had a second catheter in the portal vein. In two patients a triple catheter system was implanted including the lienal artery. Repeated flow studies with O-15 labeled water were carried out after intravenous, intraarterial (hepatic artery), intraportal, and intralienal tracer injection (30-100 mCi). Five one-minute images were acquired. The quantitative evaluation was performed with ROIs in the metastases and the liver parenchyma. Higher tracer concentrations in the lesions were noted after intraarterial injection in 15 of 18 metastases. In one patient vascular anormalities resulted in lower tracer uptake using the catheter approach. We found in one patient with small metastases (<2cm) a high tracer accumulation only after intraportal injection, indicating that the intraarterial approach is insufficient for the regional therapy. In two other cases a mixed perfusion pattern (intraarterial and intraportal blood supply of the metastases) was ob-seCved. As our results demonstrate, PET can be used for repeated perfusion studies. The quantitative evaluation is useful for therapy planning]. Results: Plasma CEA was < 2.5 in 13% patients. TPS was < 70 in 39 % cases and TAG was < 3 in 52 % patients. Tumor CEA concentration was > 1500 in all cases but 6 (81.2%). On the other hand it was < 1500 in all samples of normal mucosa but 3 (90.6%). Distribution of TPS and TAG did not differentiate between tumor and normal tissue, tumor m a r k e r values in both groups overlapped widely, especially in the case of TAG. No significant differences were seen between diploid and aneuploid patients, neither in the case of CEA, nor with TAG or TPS. Summary: Tumor concentrations of TPS and TAG are not different from normal tissue concentrations. A CEA value in tissue > 1500 probably corresponds to tumor ( 81.2% of patients showed a CEA over 1500 in tumor).",

From Apt \"87 to Feb \"92, 21 pts with carcinoid tumours were studied with 1-131-1-123~mlBG scan. The injected activity was respectively 41.4 MBq and 370 MBq. Whole body, planers and, in some pt s, SPECT studies were acquired at 24-48 and 72 hrs. Four pts were studied after resection of primitive tumour, apparently free of disease, mlBG scan resulted in every pt negative. 17. pts showed clinical or radiological evidence of disease. The images resulted positive in 8 pts (47%), negative in 8 pts (47%), doubtful in i pt (6%). In the eight positive pts mlBG uptake was intense and in line with the extent of disease only in 3 pts with bone (i pt), LA lymph nodes (i pt), liver (2 pts) and ileum localizations (I pt). Other sites of positivities were lung (3 pts), soft tissues (I pt), pancreas (I pt), liver (2 pts Radioiodine treatment (RIT) is the best adjunct to total thyroidectomy (TTX) in the treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (TC). To obtain a sufficient uptake in tumor and metastases, a depletion of cold iodine (CI) by interruption of substitutive thyroxin is achieved, in order to evaluate the possible interference of the total body CI charge on the efficiency of RIT, a prospective study on 4 groups of patients (p) was conducted. The assumption was that the mean alimentary iodine intake in Switzerland (mainly by iodinized salt) is increased to 200 _+ 124 p.g per day (Mordasini, 1984) with an urinary excretion of + 96 % (1111 + 508 nmol). Patient groups: Group A: 17 healthy volunteers (29 -73 years, 16 female (f), 1 male (m)). Group B: 17 hypothyroid (hypo) p after TTX, before RIT (18 -84 years, 12 f, 5 m). Group C: 13 hypo p after TTX and RIT, deprived of T4 and T3 substitution (subst) for 6 and 2 weeks respectively (25 -77 years, 22 f, 8 m). Group D: 55 euthyroid p, after TTX and RIT, on full T4 subst, in all groups, the 24 hour total urinary CI excretion (TUI, in nmol/24h) and the total plasma value of CI (TPI, inorganic fraction (IPI) calculated in nmol/ml) were determined (Technicon-Autoanalyzer) and cor[elated to the mean TSH value (mEq/i). It turned out by this calculation that favorable, anatomically defined, geometric conditions do exist for C-cell sterilization: (i) the remaining nommal thyroidal tissue must not be too small to allow for sufficient 1-151 uptake. This may formally seem con-tradicto~y to the current concept of completely radical thyroidectomy and (2) the remaining C-cell nests have to 5e smaller than the mean range of the betaparticles of 1-151. Quantitative aspects of these limitations will be given and the conclusion be drawn that only in cases where the above conditions are fulfilled, I-l~l will be of some benefit in MTC. The initial activity (Ao) and effective half-time (Te) were derived from sequential quantitative scans using either a rectilinear scanner or gamma camera.",

Cells were incubated For ]4 days with CDDP and P-32 in three different experiments. P-32 was added 2 days before, same day and 2 days after CDOP. When P-32 was added 2 days after CDOP, cell ktl]ing was 25-30 times greaLer than when P-32 was added 2 days before CDDP. 5 uCt of P-32 was sufficient to induce supra-additive effect. Higher doses of P-32 did not add significant gatn. Cell survival data was in good agreement with the improved clinical response in patients treated with intraperitoneal P-32 (SmCi) combined with CDDP chemotherapy. In conclusion, continuous low-dose-rate radiation by multiple intraperitoneal P-32 following each cyle of CDDP chemotherapy provides improved cell killing with acceptable toxicity for ovarian carcinoma patients.

Choosing criteria has been: positive 123-I-MIBG in all tumoral lesions and no bone marrow infiltration. Since many of the patients have received previous intensive therapy, depression of pre-treatment blood counts may be limiting a factor for treatment. A total of 38 MIBG courses were administered. MIBG was administered by infusion. In most children the dose was split into two portions each infused over a period of 4 hrs. with a 24 hrs interval in between.

Four standard PLS of 1 million counts each and SLP were performed with a GE (400a) digital gamma camera connected to a $3000 computer (GE $3000). 64 projections of the lung were registered in 64 x 64 matrices. Data were reconstructed by filtered back projection. TBB were performed 48 hours after scintiscans. During 1991, 23 episodes of acute rejection were diagnosed by biopsy in ii transplant patients (7 double lung, 2 heart-lung and 2 single lung). In 22 cases SLP cohfirmed rejection. The most abnormal findings were noted in 4 subjects with both rejection and obliterans bronchiolitis. One false-negative SLP was obtained in a patient with a minimal grade 1 rejection which subsequently resolved without treatment.

Although further study will be needed, defects detected by SLP may guide the endoscopist in choosing his biopsy site thus reducing the number of biopsies necessary to diagnose rejection.",

To avoid a biopsy a non invasive technique is needed to select those patients in whom the mucociliary (MC) transport is impaired. To evaluate the MC clearance several non-imaging, roentgenographic or radio-isotopic techniques are used. The non-imaging saccharine test is too subjective and radio-isotope investigations which are already in use need sophisticated equipment and the help of an ORL spec i a l i s t and explore only one mucus trace. In our study we tried to explore the whole nasal MC apparatus using a simple nebulizing dispenser in 15 healthy volunteers, non smokers and free from r h i n i t i s . A 99mTc-labeled colloidal albumine solution (Albures, Solco Nuclear) is used. The patient is positioned with the cheek against the parallel hole LEHR collimator of a gamma camera. 99mTc markers are placed at the top of the nose and the mastoid. Following one nebulization (0,6 ml containing 2,2 MBq 99mTc-Albures) in one nostril a continuous registration is started, 40 frames of 30 sec. in a 128x128 matrix. Every minute the distance between the top of the nose and the progressing a c t i v i t y is measured. Using least square linear regression analysis a slope is obtained, which correlates with the MC clearance rate. The weighted mean of all slopes is 6,25 mm/min (~ 0,66 S.D.). These values correspond with data reported using other techniques. CONCLUSION : This 99mTc-colloid nebulizing technique can be used as a simple screening test in the evaluation of nasal c i l i a r y a c t i v i t y . IN ACTIVE SARCOIDOSIS Altered permeability of the gut is a well-described feature in Crohn's disease.

An original software 1 was used to display and interpret data. This consists of building into the computer three dimentional histograms (Four Parameter Histograms-FPH) which allow simultaneous and independent information of localization, intensity and limits of normality for both ventilation and perfusion. The local and global values of ~'/~ ratio were also available.The Nuclear Medicine data were correlated with clinical, radiologieal and functional respiratory data of the patitents.

Transplant perfusion was classified using a time-activity-curve, which was generated over the first minute from the transplant and the contralateral iliac artery. For the initial phase were calculated the Hilson index from iliac and transplant curve and the time difference from the curve maxima (TDIFF). Additional a quantitative perfusion score (grade 1-6) was used. Analogous Scans were performed until 30 min. pi. in 5 min. periods to classify urinary excretion function. 90 studies were analyzed with a computer program, which was written in MEDICL computer language. For aqulsition a Siemens BASICAM and a MAX DELTA computer system were used with a 64*64 matrix and a temporal resolution of 0.5 sec for the first minute, respectively 15 sec. for the following 29 min. (altogether 236 frames). We could demonstrate a very good correlation between the perfusionscore and the TDiff (r=0.9). Altogether 10 renal transplants were severe affected. All 10 renal transplants had no significant perfusion (perfusionscore 6). 4 renal transplants ,which could scintigraphically not be detected, required an explantafion, because of a vascular graft versus host reaction. 5 renal transplants, which could scintigraphically detected, recovered in the clinical follow up. Only one renal transplant, which could scintigraphically detected, required an explantation. We conclude, that the analogous scan is of extraordinary importance for estimating of the transplant prognos~s in the severe affected renal transplant. For the diagnosis of transplant perfusion we consider both the qualitative perfusionscore and the quantitative TDIFF as suitable. Radionuclide phallography was performed using ~T c mlabelled autologous red blood cells in conjunction with papaverine-induced penile erections (Siraj et el. 1990). Serial blood samples were taken from the penile cavernosun to study the changes in vascular concentration of the penile corpus cavernostueduring pharmacologically-induced erections. A marked fall in the cavernosal haematocrit was observed after papaverine injection. The fall in the cavernosal haematocrit was found to be volume-dependent resulting from dilution of the cavernosal blood pool by the injected volume of the drug. This was not observed in erections produced by visual sexual stimulation. It appears that a restriction of the cavernosal venous outflow in response to papaverine injection causes sequestration of the diluted blood in the cavernosel compartment. Thus, an estimation of the penile blood volume based on the activity of a systemic venous blood sample following intracawernosal injection will introduce an error in calculation compromising the results. The degree of cavernosal haemodilution was found to aid in the differential diagnosis and was especially found to be valuable in differentiating patients of arteriogenic impotence from those with venous leakage.

Direct radionuclide cystography (DRC) allows to detect vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) by visual inspection of a dynamic image sequence. The aim of our study was to improve VUR diagnosis using a scatter correction methodology. 10 children (mean age 5.6 years) with recurrent urinary tract infections were investigated by DRC. It was observed in posterior view by direct bladder instillation of normal saline containing 37 MBq of pertechnetate in 500 ml. The acquisition was performed with a large field gamma camera equipped with a h!gh resolution parallel hole collimator and dedicated computer. A double word list mode was acquired using a 60 keV to 180 keV window to record spatial, time and energy photon information during bladder filling and compression. A time and energy sequence of 250 images was generated and then processed by Factor Analysis of Medical Image Sequences using a Target Apex Seeking procedure (FAMISTAS). In all patients, 3 spectra were extracted with their associated images : 2 scatter components associated with bladder and a pure Tc-99m photopeak. In the corresponding free scatter image the VUR was clearly identified in 2 patients. In the 8 others the VUR did not appear. The same results were obtained with X-ray cystography. As this methodology separates the photopeak from the scatter radiation, it could detect the small VUR in scatter free images. The renogram with furosemide has been proposed for the differential diagnosis between mechanical obstruction (Obs) and dilatation of the urinary tract without an obstacle. In the present work, 22 children were evaluated between 15 days and 10 months of life, corresponding to 48 renal unites (RU), with pre-natal echograplfic diagnosis of renal cavities' dilatation, confirmed posnatally. None had evidence ofyasico-ureteral reflux. A dynamic study was performed with 37 MBq (1 mCi) of 99~mTc-DTPA, 20 secYframe during 20 minutes, in a matrix of resolution of 128x128. In 9 children, furosemide (1 r a g / k g of weight) was administered e.v. simultaneous with the beginnihg of the acquisition (group 3) and in 13 other, at the end, if there w~s retention of the radiophaunaceu/dcal , continuing then the study for more 10 minutes (group II).

The Tenographic diagnosis of Obs was post~dated if there was a continuous accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical without definition of excretory phase (group I) or if at 30 minutes, there was an excretlon of less than 25% of the maximum activity retained (group II): This result was correlated with Obs confirmed by surgery. In group I, 5 out of 6 (83%) Obs were colrectiy diagnosed by furosemide study and in group I!, 3 out of 3 (100%). In group II, 4 RU defined as Obs were not yet submitted to surgery and are on functional follow-up; 6 RU are non Obs but with lower renal function (asymmetry>10%).",

This is based upon the detection of the nearly sinusoidal local activity variations occuring in the pulmonary ROI, during the cardiac cycle, after blood pool labelling and ECG R-wave synchronized acquisition with a Gamma Camera-Computer System. The phase distribution of the variations detected in healthy controls shows two peaks for different phase angles, the former corresponds to the pulmonary flow and the latter, small and at greater phase angles, represents the systemic-pulmonary flow. The amplitude of the pulsatility may inform about the magnitude and type of circulation, either poriferic or pulmonary. The phase may inform about the timing of the different flows in the ROI. The ratio of the sum of the amplitudes of the pixels in the 2ud peak to the summation of the anaplitudes in all the pixels iu the pulmonary ROI gives the relative blood flow of the systemicpulmonary shunts. Twenty five healthy controls and 26 childrea with cardiac congenital diseases have been studied with the method described. The detection and semi-quantification of pulmonary collateral flows and the assessment of irreversible changes in pulmonary vaseulature have been possible in a number of the eases studied. The simultaneous evaluation of both the phase and amplitude through mulfiparametrie histograms was used. The information obtained is an useful aid when more invasive methods may be avoided and it is complementary to pre-eardiac surgery assessment. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT in Barr~-Liou syndrome (BLS) . This disorder is characterized by cervicarthrosis, with episodes of headache and vertigo. The latter may be provoked by certain movements of the head.",

TO find out whether F-18 DOG PET noninvasively yields a correlate to PR, it was employed in 32 pts with typical CT/MR-findings of IM and compared to PR, histopathologic findings and to Tc-99m DTPA SPECT, the latter used to assess passive tumor uptake. Following cranial transmission (CTI 953/15), emission was recorded for 80 min after 300 MBq . R~gional evaluation yielded standardized uptake value (SUV), tumor-to-grey matter ratio (TGMR) and Sokoloff analysis (~41mol/miu/gm) and from 8PECT/ the tumor-to-cerebellar ratio (TCR) for DTPA (40 min pi). All TCR were >1.3 (mean:3.4). TGMR, however, was > 0.9 in 8/32(25%) IM only.

Histologic patterns revealed nO correlation to SUV or Sokoloff values. We conclude that F-18 DOG uptake in IM is not a passive process. IM may be classified for proliferation by F-18 DOG PET, even from TGMR. For absolute quantification, the Sokoloff analysis proved to be sufficient. IM with a glucose consumption of >0.3 ~mol/min/g showed significant higher proliferation and thus may be staged to be more agressive than grade I WHO.

We validated a method of semi-quantitative analysis of Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT based on circumferential profiles. For each SPECT study, 3 profiles, representing the top, middle and bottom section of the brain, were obtained. To generate these, the data cube was reoriented in the orbitomeatgl plane and 3 slices, each 4 pixels thick, were positioned by the operator on a sagittal display at the upper, middle and lower levels. The outline of the cerebral/cerebellar activity in the slices was fitted with an ellips. A second ellips with the same centre was then drawn automatically, the length of its axes being 60% of those of the first ellips. Radii were drawn through the centre of the ellipses, with 64 angular increments. The midpoint of the interception of these radii with the ellipses served as center points for 4*4*4 pixels containing volume elements, in which the cortical/cerebellar activity was sampled. The values were normalised to the maximal value in the cerebellar region.",

In both groups sumatriptan reversed the change of rCBF. Tc-99m HMPAO and SPECT has been used to study test-retest patterns of rCBF in one session using a 'split-dose' technique or on separate occasions (>24h). This study used visual stimuli to examine error sources separating effects of 1) in vitro degradation of tracer; 2) in vivo change of distribution; 3) the importance of statistics and movement/position errors. 24 volunteers participated in 4 groups of 6 (A,B,C,D). All had two xenon-inhalation scans (rest and activated). Groups A and B had 3 HMPAO injections (200 MBq each) on 3 diff. days. On day 1, (A=B), two recordings showed reproducibility and background for 'split-dose' examinations.

The loss in statistics by subtraction in split-dose mode is outweighed by a higher reliability of repositioning. Values obtained are only relative and measured activations underestimate real values considerably. The split-dose approach may be of interest in studies of seizure activity, control ofthrombolyric treatment, and pharmacological activation studies as with diamox. Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was measured in 51 structures of the rat brain after acute and/or chronic oral administration of ethanol using the quantitative autoradiographic method. In the acute experiments ethanol was given via a gastric tube 110 minutes before the 2-DG. The chronic pretreatment was performed using increasing concentrations of ethanol in the drinking water. Plasma concentrations of ethanol during the measurement of LCGU were 1.67 to 1.80 g/I (acute administration), 0.10 to 0.14 g/I (chronic administration) and 2.52 to 2.65 g/I (combined acute and chronic administration). The most striking effects on LCGU were seen in the inferior colliculus, where acute and acute plus chronic treatment with ethanol resulted in a significant decrease in LCGU by 33 and 37%, respectively, whereas chronic treatment significantly increased LCGU by 25%. In general, acute administration of ethanol decreased LCGU in 16 brain structures, particularly of the auditory system. Chronic treatment, besides its effect on the inferior colliculus, only decreased LCGU in the internal capsule. Chronic plus acute administration of ethanol decreased LCGU significantly in 22 structures. These structures were mainly identical with those influenced by the acute administration. It is concluded that an acute oral administration of ethanol has distinct and mainly depressive effects on the functional activity of several brain areas.",

All subjects reze/ved 2 doses of 99MTc-}~4P~/) (controls; mean doses 248 a~d 261 MBq, patients; mean doses 256 and 264 MB~. D~ta were acquired using a triple-headed, IGE Neurocam. Subjects were scanned in 2 conditions; a controlled resting state, and then during the performance of a visiospatial attentional task. Images were corrected for injected dose and for radio-active decay to allow comparison within and between subjects. Results. Comparison of controlled rest-state scans between normal and OC subjects revealed a global fall J J3 activity in the patient group of 21%, significant at the 1% level. Subsequent investigation of frontal lobe to cerebellar ratios demonstrated that the patient group had relatively decreased frontal lobe activity, significant at 1%. Performance of the activation task, itself involving increased activity in several brain regions in which the OC group had decreased activity at rest, failed to distinguish between the patient and the control group. CQnclusions. OC patients suffer frc~ a psychiatric condition affecting m~ny aspects of their lives. The evidence frcm this study indicates widespread disturbance of resting brain activity.

Following injection, a sequence of 110 frames at 1 see intervals was started in a 128X128 format with the patients positioned in the supine position. Regions of interest were drawn over the aortic arch (ROIao~) and bilateral brain hemispheres (ROI,.~). Graphical analysis was employed for the evaluation of the unidirectional influx constant (1%) of the tracer from the blood to the brain. The 1% values were standardized to provide objective and comparable values, brain perfusion indices (BPI), among studied subjects by setting the ratio of R O I , m size to ROI~ora size to 10. The whole brain BPI values for the normal conlrols showed a significant negative correlation with advancing age (r= -0.632). The mean of the whole brain BPI of 7.0 with s.d. of 1.4 in 20 patients with cerebrovascular disorders was significantly lower than that of 10.6 with s.d. of 1.5 in 13 normal controls. BPI measurements showed only minimal intra-and interobsever variability. Changes of the ratio of ROI,o m size and R O I~ size did not significantly influence BPI values (C.V.= 4%). Hemispheric BPI values in 19 subjects showed highly significant correlations with hemispheric mean cerebral blood flow values obtained from 133Xe SPECT (r=-0.926). This technique is easy to apply as an adjunct to SPECT and may be helpful in the quantitative evaluation of brain perfusion in routine clinical studies. 99mTc-HMPAO accumulates rapidly in the brain and remains intracellulag thus presenting a pattern of cerebral blood flow (CBF) under conditions prevailing during its injection.

Therefore, 36 patients with a symptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery and severely compromised CVRC were selected for bypass surgery. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the longterm follow-up of rCBF[rest) and CVRC. RCBF of the middle cerebral artery territory was measured at resting conditions and after stimulation with Ig of acetazolamide using the 133-xenon inhalation technique (Tomomatic 64). Postoperative studies were performed six days (n=29), two months (n=29), one year (n=19) and three years (n=11) after bypass surgery. Mean preoperative resting flow of the operated hemisphere was 55Z9 ml/100g/min. There was no significant change of resting flow in the follow-up after surgery.

The data were collected with a CTI-931/8/12 PET scanner. The analysis was done with the SPM (statistical parametric mapping) software (Hammersmith Hospital).

During each task the stimulus appeared during 300ms and the frequency was 16 trials/min (9 tasks/min for the orientation discrimination of two successive gratings). The scan duration was 40s.

In conclusion : the orientation discrimination tasks the activity in the visual cortex is stronger than the activity during the passive viewing of the stimulus. The major interest of HMPAO-SPECT in temporal epilepsy Js to give one more criterion for decision when surgery is anticipated. Previously reported studies have initially confirmed the possibility for SPECT to locate the epileptogenic zone, but they do not really consider the surgical practice. A semi-quantitative method for interpretation of NMPAO-SPECT based on a surgical compartment model of the temporal lobe is proposed. The first step is the definition of a reference reorientation plane parallel to the insular-axis. It provides a global and continuous visualization of the mesio-temporal structures. During the second step, fifty ROI for each temporal lobe are automatically selected corresponding to five coronal slices. For each ROI, the L/R ratio is calculated.",

We have evaluated the binding of a \u2022 123 synthetzc I-labeled monoclonal antibody (Mab) directed against the extracellular domain of the human EGF-R to primary human breast cancer (n=lS) and to the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431. EGF-R-Mab was purified from ascites fluid by affinity chromatography on protein A sepharose and showed thereafter on SDS-PAGE a single band resolving at 12~ molecular weight of 155 kD. On gradient gel PAGE I-EGF-R-Mab, labeled to a specific activity of 250 pg protein (i.e.l.6 nmol)/mci, displayed identical bands (silver staining) as compared to unlabeled EGF-R-Mab. Both primary human breast t~o r membrane f~naC tions as well as A431 cells bound I-EGF-R-Mab ~ specific manner suggesting high affinity ligand binding. The respective binding data were a binding capacity of 14.3\u00b16.9 gg protein/mg protein (Kd=7.2\u00b13.3 gg protein/ml) for the cell line and of 0-500 pg protein/mg protein (K~= i0-i00 gg protein/ml) for primary breast cancer. 123I-EG~-R-Mab inhibited binding of 1231-EGF to A431 cells in a competitive manner, whereas EG~2~s well as the synthetic EGF-peptide showed no effect on I-EGF-R-Mab binding. The binding of 123I-EGF-R-Mab to normal human b~east cancer membrane fractions as well as to various other t~s u e s was only minimal or negative suggesting that this I-EGF-R-Mab preparation is worth to be tested in human in vivo for detection of human breast tumors and/or metastasis.",

According to in vitro studies, atypical neuroleptics occupy D2-receptors to a lesser extent. By means of the IBZM-SPECT technique it is possible to obtain in vivo data about the amount of non-bound D2-receptors (predominantly in the striatum) in schizophrenic patients. In order to understand whether the antipsychotic effect of the neuroleptics is correlated with the affinity to the D2-receptor, we compared the D2-binding results of typical with those of atypical neuroleptics. In patients on typical neuroleptics (n = 11) such as haloperidol, the D2receptors could not be visualized as clearly as in drug-flee patients, presumably because they were already occupied by the typical neuroleptic. In patients receiving an atypical neuroleptic such as clozapine, the D2-receptors could be better demonstrated by the IBZM-SPECT. In conclusion, our data suggest that the antipsychotic effect of typical and atypical neuroleptics may not be closely related to the binding to the D2-dopamine receptor. A variety of linear and macrocyclic N-containing ligzinds and derivatives of ethylene diamine have been described the last ten years as potential 99mTc-complexing agents with the view to develop new radiopharmaceuticals. At this time, only 99mTc-l, has been evaluated in humans. However, it was not reported which isomer of CYC was used. Therefore we have investigated the labelling characteristics and biological behaviour in mice of the 3 isomers of CYC: the cisisomer, which is the meso compound (D and both trans-isomers 1R, 2R(+) or I] and 1S, 2S (-) or lIl.

These kinds of [99mTclII(L)(X)2]+ complexes are usually prepared in a two step procedure. Pertechnetate is fast reduced at high temperature by stannous chloride in alkaline medium in the presence of Schiff-base ligand L. The intermediate formed incorporates a TcVO core and a doubly deprotonated L ligand anion. In the second step, the intermediate reacts with the excess phosphine X, acting as both reductant and ligand to give the desired Q product. The reaction course is monitored by HPLC with g ray flow detector. The product cannot be administered into humans at this stage. First, all reagents in excess, particularly phosphine must be removed, and the radiopharmaceutical prepared in physiological saline, should contain less than 10% ethanol. To achieve this, a purification procedure, involving C-18 Sep-pak cartridge, has been developed. The pure radiopharmaceutical is finally eluted with 80% ethanol-normal saline; the eluent must be diluted with normal saline to an ethanol content of below 10%, and filtered trough a sterile 0.21.tm filter The Q-12 agent showed both a very rapid liver and renal clearance (estimated 25% of the injected dose cleared through the kidneys). This is a very advantageous feature for a potential heart perfusion agent. As the myocardial uptake of Q-12 is more than 2% of the injected dose, lung uptake negligible, and blood clearance very fast, good images can be obtained as soon as 30 min. after injection.",

Division of Nuclear Medicine and * Allergy unit, H.C.U.G., 1211 GENEVA 4 SWITZERLAND IN VITRO COMPARISON OF CYTOTOXIC AND ANTI PROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS OF COLD AND 1311.LABELED mlBG. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (m IBG) is a ring-iodinated alkyl-guanthidine recently shown to specfcally inhibit mitochondrial respiration, namely the complex I of the respiratory chain. Smets et al have previously shown that m IBG is cytotoxic and that may contribute to the clinical responses obtained with the radiolabeled drug. For this reason, we extended this work in order to investigate if cold m IBG may be used in addition to 1311-m IBG to obtain a more effective antitumoral effect. Methods: This was done by comparing in vitro metabolic, cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of cold mlBG and 1311-m IBG in the human premonocytic (U937) line. Ceils were exposed overnight to increasing concentrations of cold m IBG (1 to 100 #M/well) and with increasing activities of 1-131 of labeled tTace concentration of 1311-m IBG (5 to 40 #Ci/weli). Cell proliferation was estimated by the 4 hours uptake of 3Hthymidine (THY) that expressed DNA synthesis. Cell proliferation was also determined by limiting dilution analysis (LDA) that expressed the efficacy of cells to develop clones after 3 weeks of culture. In addition, cell metabolism was measured by the 45min uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) simultaneously to propranolol uptake (PROP) that was considered as a'control of cell mass. Results are expressed in % from control condition. Results: There was a dose-dependent inhibition of %FDG uptake (ANOVA, n=12, p<0.0001) as well as of %THY uptake (ANOVA, n=25, p<0.0001) whereas %PROP uptake remained constant. LDA showed that proliferative activity was reduced as a function of m IBG concentration (ANOVA, n=22, p<0.0001) and was abolished at concentration of 104 M. 1311-m IBG added a specific toxic effect (ANOVA, n=26, p<0.0003). ConclusiOns: These studies show that cold m IBG per se is a toxic and antiproliferative agent and that radioiodination with 1311 has additional toxic effect. These results suggest that the combine use of cold m IBG and 1311-m IBG could be more efficient for therapy than 1311-m IBG alone.",

A system analysis consists of the following elements: -1 -Definition of performance requirements. -2 -Recursive deseriptlon of the entire procedure as smaller (atomic) procedures, including all related quality control procedures such as ealibratlon, verification, instruction and training. -3 -Description of possible alternatives for each (atomic) procedure. -4 -Listing all possible 'failures' for each (atomic) (alternative) procedure. -5 -Description of all interactions between (failures) of (atomic) procedures. -6 -Synthesis of the 'ideal' procedure bottom-up using all available data on interactions, failures and alternatives.",

Joseh Fourier University, Grenoble -FRANCE Claude Bernard University CERMEP, Lyon -FRANCE IS IODO-LABELED METHYL FATTY ACID.A TRACER FOR MYOCARDIAL VIABILITY ? VALIDATION USING FDG-PET AFTER AN ACUTE INFARCTION, Myocardial viability implies glucose uptake and fatty acid (FA) accumulation. Methyliodo-FA has been proposed for the study of myocardial viability in SPECT. Twelve patients were studied within one month after the onset of a first acute Q wave myocardial infarction (M]) : 6 inferior and 6 anterior. Two tomograms were performed during the same week : one SPECT, after injection at rest of 4 mCi of 16[1231]-iodo-3-methylhexadecanoic acid (MIHA) and one PET after injection of 7 mCi of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) in glucose loaded patients. For each patient, SPECT and PET were red independently. The left ventricale was divided in 9 segments wich semiquantitatively analyzed by 3 independant observers. The results expressed as viable (tracer uptake) or not viable (defect). One hundred and eight segments were observed. In 104, results were concordant for SPECT and PET : 93 viable and 11 non viable. In 4 segments, results were discordant : 3 FDG viable but M/HA non viable, and 1 case FDG non viable and MIHA viable. Using FDG as the standard, residual viability in a MI area is detected by MIFIA with a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 92%, a positive predictive value of 99% and a negative predictive value of 78%. 4P5-7 D.

TcN-NOET, nitrido bis (N-ethoxy, N-ethyl dithiocarbamato) Technetium (V)(Tc-99m) is a new neutral lipophilic myocardial perfusion agent wich showed good uptake in myocardinm of several animal species as well as in humans. To define the temporal relationship between TcN-NOET and myocardial blood flow, we compared the myocardial retention of TcN~NOET at 15 (GR1) and 90 min. (GR2) to labeled microspheres simultaneously injected into the left atrium of 6 open chested dogs. A wide range of flows was induced by IV dipyridamole (0,5 mg/kg over 4 min) and LAD partial occlusion. The same protocol as in GR2 was repeated on 3 dogs with reflow beginning 15 min after the radiotracer injection (GR3). For 198 myocardial segments in GR1,192 in GR2 and 203 in GR3, TcN-NOET tissue retention versus microsphere measured flow dam were best fitted to linear functions. The correlation coefficients were 0.94, 0.91 and 0.26 in GR1, 2 and 3 respectively. Redistribution is near complete after 90 rain of reflow in the ischemic territory.Due to a transitory pulmonary uptake of TcN-NOET, myocardial scintigraphy cannot be done before 30 minutes after injection. Thus potentially TcN-NOET can be used to evaluate myocardial blood flow in human if a significant redistribution is excluded during the first 45 minutes following IV injection.",

Morphologic examination allows the determination of times of biliary kinetic in the biliary t~act, through the anastomosis and in the small bowel. 31 QHB were performed in 20 liver traneplant (L'r) patients, 2 heterotopic and 19 orthutepic. On the basis of clinical feature and biological parameters we separated 3 groups : normal(11), e~ahepat~c cholesta~Ls (7) and intrahepatic cholestasis13 : Rejection (4),Hepatitis(5),Steatosis(1), Aspeeific (3). reports (1) normal quantitative parameters in LT pa~ents using mebrofenin ; Tl12 is twice as in healthy subjects.

Patients with the acquired immuandeficieecy syndrome (AIDS) suffer from severe chest infection, rapid diagnosis and early treatmcat may reduce monalility. ~he aim of this study, using In-Ill-HIG, was to evaluate whether lung/heart ralos could distinguish Pneumocytsis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and other causes of chest infection in 34 patients with AIDS (1 female, mean age 32) presenting with respiratory symptoms (1 patient had two studies 5 months apart). The geometric mean for lung and heart activity was obtained using die anterior and posterior images of the chest obtained at 4, 24 and 48 hours after the administration of 37MBq In-ll 1 -HIG. Patients were placed in 3 groups, based on the final clinical and laboratory diagnosis (i) PCP, 0i) other chest infections, (iii) thos~ with no chest infection or pulmonary Kaposi's Sarcoma. Of the 16 patients with PCP, 15 studies were positive on visual analysis. All 9 patients with other infection had positive studies and of the patients with no infection or Kaposi's Sarcoma, all had negative studies. Mean (+-standard deviation) lung/heart ratios w~re as follows; Tira\u00a2 post injection Diannosis (hrs) PCP Other infections No infection (n=i6) (~) (n=10) 4 0.5i (0.09) 0.48 (o.06) 0.48 (o.o6) 7.4 0.54 (0.o6)* 0.57 (O.ll) 0.48 (o.07) 48 0.60 (0.05)* 0.61 (0.08)* 0.49 (0.07) *p<0.05 (unpaired \"t\" test), compared with no infection. Conclusion: In patients with Pneumoeystis earinii pneumonia lung heart ratios are significantly increased at both 24 and 48 hours post injection and in patients with other chest infectiofis at 48 hours post injection compared to those with no infection. Early (24 hours) diagnosis of PCP is possible with this method.7P2-7 K.Kostit, Z.Latkovid ~, V.Obradovid, B.Davidovid, ~-R a z u m e n i 6 Nuclear Medicine Departement and Ophthalmological Clinic ~ Medical School and UKC, Beograd-Yu 99mTc-~PAO WBC SCINTIGRAPHY IN THE DETECTION OF INFLAMATORY LESIONS OF THE ORBIT",

It has been chimed that it might be a marker of tumor proliferation. The a/m of our study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of TPS, one of the specific epitopes of TPA, in the detection of tumor growth. We studied 73 patients (78 TPS determinations), I7 M and 56 F, age 57.6\u00b113.3 y (23-87 y), 10 normal subjects and 25 pre~nant women in different gestational ages. Seventy two patients (pts) had confirmed diagnosis of maids, nancy: breast -31 pteg coloreetal -13 pts; ovarian -5 pts; uterus -4 pts; sarcoma -2 pts; lymphoma -2 pts; l e u k e m i a -1 pt; tumor of u n l m w n origin -3 pta; other tumors -l0 pls. TPS was detemained quantitatively by IRMA. Tumoral activity, regardeless of tumor type, was classified in 3 groups: non evidence of disease (NED); stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). RESULTS: In normals, TPS had a median value of 14,8 U/L In pts NED (8 pts) TPS values were alwgys zero. In 27 pts with SD median TPS values were $0.7+183 U/L In the 43 pts with PD, median value was 433.9+730 U/L Difference between TPS determinations in the group of pts with SD and PD was statisticaly significant (p<0.001). In 13 pts with coloreetal cancer and 16 pts with breast cancer we had acass to simultaneous determinations of other tumor markers (CEA, Ca19-9 and Ca15-3). We obtained agreement between TPS and the other markers in 3/9 03%) of the determinations in colorectal c~mcer and in t2/16 (75%% in breast cancer.

This technique is based on: a) melanoma targeting by i.v. injection of 0.5-1.0 mg of cold biotinylated MoAbs 225.28S b) after 24-48 h i.v. injection of an excess of cold avidin c) postlabeling of melanoma by i.v. injection of a fast clearance radioactive biotin derivative ([Tc-99m]PAO-Biotin) d) imaging within 1-2 h from post-labeling using a brain dedicated SPET system (ASPECT, Digital Scintigraphic Inc.). The Tc-99m-MoAbs 225.28S RIS localized 4/5 ocular melanomas whereas the 3-step pretargeting technique identified 5/5 melanomas. The patient positive only at the pretargeting technique had a small size lesion (<7mm) and in all the 3-step studies there was an absence of non specific nasopharyngeal background.

This method allows us to calculate the right ven~ricufar ejection fraction (RVEF). The objective of this study is to reveal and to promote this technique to technologists in general. When using this technique it may be preferable to have some connections with a teaching hospital (or an experienced nuclear cardiology department) in addition to gathering the knowledge from the literature.There is no accepted reference method for measuring RVEF, but we do have a good clinical validation within the same pathology.Furthermore, we applied the first pass technique for the measurement of LVEF as well, during the injection of 99mTc-MIBI. The results were comparable withSB). On the other hand, up to ten percent of first pass studies have to be rejected due to several technical reasons e.g. poor quality of the radioactivity bolus, inappropriate ROI ....... etc. N Molea, RJ Caltahan, RA Wilkinson, E Tsai, TJ Brady, HW Strauss and MI Papisov.

HAMA were measured by ELISA and RIA (anti-idiotypic and anti-tsotypic) and CA 125 was retested after HA/vIA removal (Protein G adsorption or by PEG). Results: CA 125 assay using PC 125 was massively affected by HAMA:690- 107,660 U/ml, mean 19,047, whereas using B43.13 Mab in vitro only moderately elevated CA 125 values were obtained: 23.8-650 Uhnl, mean 183. HA/VIA levels were strongly positive in all patients, protein G adsorption demonstrated the HAMA effect: CA 125 dropped from a mean 8221 U/ml to 96 U/rid. Testing for antiddintypie HAMA showed a 30-50 percentage. Most interesting were the clinical courses and survival times of these patients: 7 patients are disease free or show no change, 2 are in progression and 1 died. Survival time after IS was 8-43 months, mean 22,4 months. From these data we conclude: Compared to the poor survival of advanced ovarian cancer the patients producing anti-idiotypie HAMA benefitted from Mab immunization.

(VENTILATION 1 PERFUSION -FOUR PARAMETER HISTOGRAMS) AND LUNG CT DENSITY In order to study tung emphysematous lesions in carriers of abnormal phenotypes of al-Pi (2 ZZ, 4 MZ, 2 SS, 5 MZ), CT scanning for evaluation of CT lung density and Four Parameter Histograms (FPH) were used. The last method based upon an original software consists of building in the computer, three dimensional histograms, which allow simultaneous and independent observation of abnormalities of ventilation and perfusion in a single image and it is an alterative to the WQ ratio images. The ventilation/perfusion studies were performed with 133Xe and 99raTe-HAM. A total of 13 individuals, 11 men and 2 women aged 43.95:16.1 were studied. From the results it emerged: CT lung densities correlate significantly with seric levels of ~xl-pi (p<0.005; r=0.727) and with 133Xe mean washout time,(MWT) (p<0.005; r=0.785). Moderate abnorma/ities of the V/Q ratio were found particularly in carriers of phenotypes ZZ and MZ, with low sedc levels of al-Pi, abnormal decreased CT-densities and high MWT.. On contrary carriers of phenotypes SS and MS with sefic levels of al-Pi in the lower range of normality showed normal CT-densities, almost normal MWT and severe abnormalities of V/Q. Information supplied by FPH about localization, intensity and limits of normality for both ventilation and perfusion, is important for the detection of alterations of these parameters and for a correct interpretation of values of V/Q ratio.

It has been recently reported that avidin ~fficiently removes biotinylated MoAbs from the blood in animal model systems. We report our experience with 20 colon cancer patients operated on approximately of 7 days after i.v. injection of 1 mg of 125-I labeled biotinylated MoAbs (B72.3 or anti CEA FO23C5) followed by an equimolar amount of cold avidin 2 days later. Blood samples and external probe counts were taken to evaluate blood clearance of the radiotracer. A decrease of 94% (range 76-99%) of the circulating radioactivity was achieved in 3 to 5 days.Tumors were localized by probe in 13/20 patients (65%), with an average T/nT ratio of 2.8 (range. 1. .0).Immunohistochemical analysis showed that antigen was expressed in 15/20 patients. Five patients (25%) were true negatives and two (10%) false negatives; none was false positive. With the use of 125I-biotinylated MoAbs followed by avidin the surgeon was able to operate these patients with minimal bloodpool activity within 7 days, (range [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] rather than 20-25 days,identifying subclinical deposits of tumor in 2 cases of primary cancer and in 1 case of local recurrences. (pts) with advanced stage at diagnosis show a poorer prognosis. Fortunately, this is not a frequent condition and, as a consequence, poor data have been reported on prognostic factors in these pts. To better define these aspects, we evaluated a group of 214 pts with distant metastases from TC. There were 141 females, 73 males; 100 had papillary (PC) and 114 follicular (FC) cancer. Mean age was 44 yrs for PC-and 53 yrs for pts had metastases to lung, 76 to bones, 46 to medistinum. All pts underwent total thyroidectomy, 131I therapy and then were treated with L-thyroxine. In some cases with low 131I uptake (RIU) by metastatic tissue (less than .01% of administered dose) or with disease progression despite 131I, external radiotherapy (48 cases) and/or chemotherapy (34 cases) ff~re performed. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 25 yrs, mean 7.3 yrs. During the follow-up~ clinical, echographic, radiological, scintigraphic and thyroglobulin survey was made. Prognostic factors were studied by univariate analysis (log-rank test) and multivariate analysis ( Cox-model) . Chi-square test was used to compare frequencies and Kaplan-Meier method to calculate survival curves. Univarfate analysis showed that survival was influenced by age, histology, RIU and site of metastases (p < .0001). However, a closed inter-relationship was found among these factors. Multivariate analysis defined as significant and independent prognostic factors age (p < .0001), R1U (p = .001) and site of metastases (p ~-.002), but not histology. The worst prognosis was found in pts older than 60 yrs, with bone metastases or metastases with low RIU (10-yr survival rate < 10%). The best prognosis was found in young people with lung or mediastinal metastases and with high RIU (10-yr survival rate = 100%). Sex was not.proven to represent an important prognostic factor in our series.",

Serum calcitonin and calcium levels were determined before and I, 2, 3, 5 and 10 min after each infusion. Anterior images of the neck and upper chest were obtained one week before and at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after the infusions. Prior to and after the infusions the regions of interest were generated over the thyroldal region, metastatic sites of MTC and blood pool of the heart. The average count ratio of these ROI's to the background before and after the infusion were compared,The result of this study suggests that the uptake of Tc-ggm(V) DMSA is reduced in the metastatic sites of MTC and confined to the blood pool after the infusion of Ca-gluconate. On the other hand, no effect of pentagastrin was detected on the uptake of Tc-ggm(V) DMSA. Although both infusions increase the serum calcitonin and calcium levels, the level of calcium is higher in calcium infusions than pentagastrin infusion. We belleve that the uptake of Tc-99m(V) DMSA in the metastatic MIC is marked]y influenced by serum calcium levels.",

Wilson's disease is a rare familial disorder, inherited as an autosomal trait and characterized by excessive deposition of copper, especially in the liver and brain. Early treatment is essential for removal of copper before it can produce neurologic and hepatic damage. We applied Tc-99m HMPAO brain perfusion SPECT to 9 individuals of 3 families (8 men and I woman) having at least an individual with proven Wilson's disease in the family, for the early diagnosis of central nervous system involvement. We compared the SPECT findings with computerized tomography (CT). In two male individuals of a family, (one symptomatic and the other asymptomatic) we detected a hypoperfused region in the left frontoparietal cerebral cortex. CT of the neurologically symptomatic individual was abnormal and supported the scintigraphic findings, however; asymptomatic individual's CT was normal. SPECT and CT findings of the remaining 7 individuals were interpreted as normal. We believe that Tc-99m HMPAO brain perfusion SPECT is a useful tool for the early determination of brain involvement in patients with wilson's disease before the copper accumulation becomes sufficient to destroy the nerve cells. Since the disease is potentially reversible, appropriate therapy will prevent brain damage. This is a preliminary report and we think that a greater population having Wilson's disease should be investigated.",

In all four patients, 1-123 IDex to m-AChR was decreased in the anterior hippocampus on the side of the electric abnormality. The hippocampal left-to-right ratio for 1-123 IDex binding was 0.82 + 0.06 (mean ~ SD).There was no asymraetry in 1-123 IDNx binding in amygdala (R=1.02 ~ 0.06).Hippocampal perfusion in patients was syrametric (R=0.97 ~ 0.07).The controls showed no asymmetry in hippocampal 1-123 IDex binding (R=0.99 and 1.00).The results suggest specific changes of hippocampal m-AChR in partial complex epilepsy.The changes may be due to hippocampal cell loss or downregulation of m-AChR secondary to an increase in concentration of e n d o g e n o u s a c e t y l c h o l i n e , a c o n v u l s a n t neurotransmitter. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of benzodiazepine medication on 1-123-iomazenil (8-defluoro-7-iodo-flumazenil) binding, which has been shown to be a very potent antagonist of central benzodiazepine receptors. 28 studies were performed on 12 benzodiazepine Ireated psychiatric patients, 9 patients after withdrawn of benzodiazepine medication and as control 7 patients without any benzodiazepine treatment. SPECT (double head camera) imaging was performed 10 min and 100 min after application of 200 MBq 1-123 iomazenil. For semiquantitative evaluation of the SPECT images regions of interest which follow anatomical structures of the brain were used. According to PET experiences the specific binding was defined as average counts/pixel in a cortical region minus average counts per pixel in the pons (100 rain p.i.). Results: The specific binding in benzodiazepine treated patients was reduced between 20-80% compared to benzodiazepine free patients. Moreover, benzodiazepine treated patients showed a more rapid wash out. After benzodiazepine withdrawal the activity distribution was found normalized. In conclusion, 1-123 iomazenil can be used to image and to quantify benzodiazepine receptor occupancy by SPECT in humans in relation to different benzodiazepines.",

We examined 24 patients suffering from GEP (predominantly carcinoids, N=15) in whom active disease was established by imaging/invasive procedures (N=6), hormone levels (N=2), or both (N=I6). Single and multiple liver metastases were counted as one. A total of 50 loci was thus verified. Scintigraphy (planar and SPECT) was performed N verified loci 19 18 3 9 focus in the skull firstly detected by pentatreotide scintiqraphy proved to be a meningeoma. Critical analysis of the raise positive and false negative ratios turned out in tavoar of pentatreotide. There is little difference between the results after 4 and 24 h but sensitivity for bone metastases seems to be improved by 24 h-images. in conclusion, mln-pentatreotide is useful in detecting somatostatin receptor positive GEP/metastases. It could have an impact on therapy planning. In this study we concentrate on 2 of them that can be directly tested by muscarinic receptor imaging. One hypothesis is based on the observation that THA at clinical concentrations blocks a substantial amount of muscarinic receptors in animals. A second hypothesis is derived from animal studies that demonstrated significant down-regulation of muscarinic receptors after continued administration of cholinesterase inhibitors. The purpose of this study was to investigate these effects in human subjects after administration of THA. For this purpose quantitative muscarinic receptor imaging was performed in 7 Alzheimer's patients with positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]tropanyl benzilate (TRB). The subjects were scanned before and 1 week after administration of THA (n=4) or placebo (n=3). The resuhs show an unchanged free muscarinic receptor density in all examined regions (thalamus, striatum and caudate). It is likely that down-regulation would have occured in regions with a high density of cholinergic neurons and receptors (striatum, caudate). Down-regulation was looked for in the thalamus which has many receptors but few cholinergic neurons. We conclude that the disappointing results of THA treatment in Alzheimer patients are not explained by receptor blockage or down-reguIation. Since 1982, the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide is available as a therapeutic agent for neuroendocrine somatostatinreceptor positive tumors. For diagnostic purposes, the [123-I-TyrOloctreotide has recently been developed. In preliminary studies with this agent, various tumors with somatostatin receptors were detectable. Due to some limitations of 1-123, the Indium-111 labeled agent [In-111 -DTPA-Phe~]-octreotide has also been developed (Mallinckrodt Inc., Petten, The Netherlands). The in vitro and in vivo binding properties of this new agent have been established and it is currently being investigated in a phase III clinical trial. We report the first results with this agent obtained in two children (2.5 and 8 years old) with stage IV neuroblastoma. Both patients were on chemotherapy during the study. Each child was injected with 30 MBq octreotide. The pre-tested labeling efficiencies were 97.5% and 99.5%. Whole body scans were conducted at 4 and 24 hours p.i. and the results were compared with other imaging modalities and with 1-123-MIBG scans which were performed within 1 week in both patients. In one pat. the IN-OCT showed neuroblastoma lesions (skull, liver, bone) with better image quality than 1-123-MIBG, and showed additionally two bone lesions. The other patient showed an overall weak IN-OCT uptake in a mediastinal lesion which was clearly visualized by 1-123-MIBG, and an MIBG-positive abdominal lesion was completely missed with IN-OCT. Since a close relationship between scan results and presence of receptors can be assumed from in vitro studies, these discrepant preiiminar~ in vivo findings may indicate that the investigated neuroblastomas may have different numbers of receptors or a different status of binding capacity even in the same patient. Large numbers of binding sites for somatoslatin h~ve been detected in-vitro in many tumours arising from central nervous system and endocrine organs. The scintigraphic localization of these receptors offers the possibility to detect metastases or to consider oetreotide therapy.We examined 35 patients with suspected somatostafin receptor bearing tumours(carcinoids n=16; brain and pituitary n=10, pancreatic n=3; gastrinomas n=3; small cell lung cancer n=l; medullary thyroid carcinomas n=2) .Tyr-3-Octreotide as somatostatin receptor analogue was labelled with a chloramin-T-method according to a previous published procedure.Gammacamera images (SIEMENS-ROTA; MICRO-DELTA) were performed 10rain, lh and 4h p.i.;SPECT-images 2h p.i. In 2 patients with islet celt carcinomas somatostatin receptors have been proven in-vitro by autoradiography.In 5 patients a positive therapeutic effect of octreofide was known,in 3 patients octreotide therapy failed.In all 7 patients with evident receptors I2123-TYR-3 -OCTREOTIDE localized the tumours . When treatment failed, no accumulation could be demonstrated. In 4 patients with metastases of careinoids receptors eunld be demonstrated, 12 patients demonstrated no uptake.2 of 3 gastrinomas could be localized. One small cell lung carcinoma had intensive uptake of the tracer. Oliomas demonstrated different uptake in dependence from their histological differentiation.In conclusion ,I-123-TYR-3-OCTREOTIDE is able to localize somatostatin receptors in turnouts. Positive scans are predicitve of a therapeutic effect of octreotide treatment.; negative scans of a negative octreotide effect.

Scintigraphic resulis were compared with those obtained by morphological imaging methods (CT-scan in all cases, US and MRI).OctreoScanRlll showed lesions in 25 of 28 patients whereas morphological imaging was positive in 22-patients. Among the 3 negative scintiscans, 2 patients (1 gastrinoma, 1 MEN-l) had also negative morphological imaging studies and 1 insulinoma was positive at US only. In 4 of the 25 positive scintiscans no lesions were detected by the other imaging modalities. The primary tumour was visualized in 12 patients by scintigraphy and in 7 patients by morphological imaging. Local turnout recurrence was scintigraphically detected in 6 cases among which only 3 were found with the other techniques. Twenty-seven metastatic sites (13 hepatic) were shown by scintigraphy compared to 21 (12 hepatic) with the morphological imaging methods.In conclusion, Octreoscan~l 11 scintigraphy is a sensitive method for GEP tumour detection providing additional information compared to the morphological imaging methods.

MPC was used to determine RCP of samples after i, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 rain incubation periods. Our results indicate that 2 rain was the shortest incubation time which yielded an acceptable RCP of 94.7+0.4% (n=60) over the 24-hr evaluation time. The use of an instant hot water m~chine not only avoids those probl(~s associated with the MO heating method but also provides a rapid, efficient, and relatively simple option for preparation of MIBI. Pl~telets seem to have great importance in the diagnosis of different thrombotic diseases. 9?mTc-HH-PAO has bee~ evaluated as an aBent ~o radiolabel h~man olatelets in vitro. In these experiments we controlled the affects of cadiolabelling and isolation orocedure on the viability, functionality and m~cromorphology of platelets obtained from healthy volunteers.9?mTc-HH-PAO was prepa~ec in our laboratory. To have labelled olatelets 2-~xlO cells were incubated with 0.180 mg/30 MBo 99mTc- HM-PAO in one ml at room temperature for 30-&O minutes. The labelling efficiency ranged between 50-60% ano the radioactivity release from the platelets amounted to aoou~ 8-10% in 60 minutes.Platelet micromorohology was studies by scanning ( ",

In our study we developed a convenient labelling method of producing iodine (I-123, 1-131) -NAM for biodistribution studies which we have done in rats.Incorporation of iodine in NAM may have a significant effect on its biological properties.Also the lipophilicity of NAM is increased and the cerebral uptake may be increased when iodine is incorporated in NAM. NAM was labelled with iodine in the 5position by halogen exchange reaction. was synthesized from 5bromo-nicotinic acid (Aldrich).Br-nicotinic acid was acylated with thionyl chloride and the product was reacted with ammonia to produce Br-NAM. Proton-NMR spectra was obtained from the Br-nicotinic acid and from the purified Br-NAM. Iodine NAM was made by heating in the presence of catalyst and glacial acid.Iodine NAM was purified by RP-HPLC. Labelling percentage after exchange reaction was >90 %.After purification the radiochemical purity of the product determined by HPLC was >98 % and the specific activity of 1-123-NAM was >655 GBq/mg.In conclusion a method of producing iodine labelled NAM was developed.

            "text": "Our investigations on the development of new myocardial perfusion imaging agents have been extended to cationic phenanthroline complexes of Tc(II). The complexes were synthesized by reduction of pertechnetate with sodium borohydride in the presence of 1, 10-phenanthroline (phen), 4-methyl-or 5-methyl-l,10phenanthroline. After purification by HPLC the complexes were characterized by IR/VIS-UV spectrophotometry and magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrating the d J configuration of Tc(II).. For biodistribution evaluation in mice, [99mTc(phen)]2+ was obtained with a reaction yield of 12% and radiochemical purity of 92.5%. The rather hydrophilic complex was predominantly excreted by the kidneys. Its low blood retention resulted in a heart/blood ratio of 4.2 at 100 min post-injection which may be improved by synthesizing the analogous complex of Tc(I) and/or by using suitable phenanthroline derivatives as ligands. In 1989 the successful use of gadolinium phthaleincemplexone as a hepatobillary NMR contrast agent in rabbits has been described (KAWAMURA et al.) . As this complex was applied obviously without preceding isolation and characterization, we wanted to improve the chemical aspects of that work. Trials to reproduce the poor production data failed, but we succeeded in synthesizing a new gadolinium phthaleincomplexone compound (Gd-PC) which could be isolated, purified and characterized by normal methods of analytical chemistry. Additionally the same complex labelled with the short lived gamma emitter 6 h) was produced with regard to biodistribufion studies In animals.Our synthesis is carried out by adding a solution of gadolinium nitrate to a diluted solution of phthalein complexone in the heat. The resulting crude product can be purified by gel chromatography. For labelling with , produced in a nuclear reactor, the synthesis procedure was scaled down by a factor of 103 . In contrast to the results of KAWAMURA our Gd-PC is sparingly soluble in water, but it can be sohited easily in isotonic sodium hydrogencarbonate solution. Whereas the ultraviolett spectrum of the compound differs only unessentially from that of the free phthalein complexone, the infrared spectrum shows some significant differences. Like the broad peaks in the NMR spectrum this points out to complexation. As a result of FAB mass spectrometry and activation analysis the molar ratio of gadolinium to phthalein complexune in the purified substance seems to be 1 : 1. The labelled product was shown to be identical with the inactive compound. 67-70 (1989) . ",
