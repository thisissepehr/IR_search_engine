All procedures were carried out in compliance with the National Institutes of Health-adopted Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (3) and were approved by the Bioethics Committee of State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Medical University. Mice were randomly divided into 8 groups as indicated in the figure legends (n = 5 in each). After anaesthetised with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg), mice were intratracheally inoculated with HA (1 mg/kg) or HA (0.5 mg/kg) in the presence or absence of pretreatment with JAK3 inhibitor VI (JAK3inh, 0.15mg/kg, Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), forskorlin(FSK,10mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and gliebenclamide (Gli,10mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich) respectively by intraperitoneal injection. The control group received an equal volume of PBS. Lung tissues were harvested at 12 h after HA inoculation.",

Forskolin (10 \u03bcM apical and basal), an adenylate cyclase activator known to activate CFTR, was used to induce anion secretion via an increase in cAMP. To inhibit electrically conductive Na + transport, amiloride (100 \u03bcM) was added to the apical solution in all studies.The K-H solution contained (in mM): 117 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH 2 PO 4 , 1.2 MgSO 4 , 24.8 NaHCO 3 , 2.56 CaCl 2 and 11.1 glucose.
