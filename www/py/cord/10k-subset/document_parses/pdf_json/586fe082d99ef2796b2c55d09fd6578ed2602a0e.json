Intensive farming may result in more available and cheaper meat for an already overfed Western population, but it does not increase the total amount of food available globally for human consumption. In fact, studies suggest the opposite is true. 1 Intensive farming is sometimes called 'a protein factory in reverse' , because large amounts of protein and energy in the form of grain or soybeans are channeled through animals, ending up with a much smaller output of protein and energy. 2 For instance it takes up to 13 kgs of grain to produce 1kg of beef, 6 kgs of grain to produce 1 kg of pork, chickens are less inefficient but even so the grain-to-meat conversion is about 3 to 1. 1 The entire process is an inefficient way of feeding humans (it would be far more efficient to use the croplands to grow protein crops for humans to eat). And, rather than contributing to feeding the world, intensive farming is contributing to inflating grain prices so that grain is less affordable for the poorer nations. 3 Intensive farming also places greater demands on the environment in terms of energy and water than other forms of farming, 1 in addition to the recognised animal welfare issues.",

IMCECAH1367AVJAn important media story involving the AVA emerged in the first half of August with two articles appearing in the Sydney Morning Herald about perceived 'over vaccination' of dogs and cats by veterinarians. The AVA issued a media release to refute some aspects of the articles.The new AVA policy, Vaccination of dogs and cats, was developed by the same process as all AVA policies. A revision draft of an existing policy was prepared by a working group, in this case led by the ASAVA Policy Advisory Council representative. After discussion and amendment of the draft by Policy Advisory Council, a second draft was circulated to AVA members for comment. Comments were discussed and incorporated, and the next draft debated again by Policy Advisory Council before being finalised. The AVA Board reviewed the final draft, and ratified the policy in June.",

They were in fact learning their craft on paying clients animals.The Western Australian solution was to develop relationships with various animal welfare organisations who consented to supply patients for sterilisation operations. Murdoch University veterinary students now have access to live cats and dogs on which they learn asceptic surgery using the ochidectomy and ovarohysterectomy as the surgical model.The program is now in its fourth year and builds through the fourth and fifth years of the course. There is a maximum of seven, three person groups, operating at the one time in the fourth year with one surgeon, one assistant and one anaesthetist in each group. These groups are supervised by at least two experienced veterinary surgeons, two veterinary nurses and one specialist anaesthetist.The feedback being received is very positive from all parties. It is saving the welfare organisations money, patients get the best care and treatment, the students learn from a real life situation and veterinary clients are not having to pay for recent graduates to learn on their beloved pets.I would commend the program to all veterinary schools and welfare organisations in other states.",
