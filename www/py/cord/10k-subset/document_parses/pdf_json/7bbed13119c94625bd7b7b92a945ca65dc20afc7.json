These prophylactics have been used for centuries but still to this day only three main design strategies exist: (1) live attenuated virus (LAV) vaccines, (2) killed or inactivated virus vaccines, (3) and subunit vaccines of the three, the most effi cacious vaccines remain LAVs. LAVs replicate in relevant tissues, elicit strong cellular and humoral responses, and often confer lifelong immunity. While this vaccine strategy has produced the majority of successful vaccines in use today, there are also important safety concerns to consider with this approach. In the past, the development of LAVs has been empirical. Blind passage of viruses in various cell types results in the accumulation of multiple attenuating mutations leaving the molecular mechanisms of attenuation unknown. Also, due to the high error rate of RNA viruses and selective pressures of the host environment, these LAVs, derived from such viruses, can potentially revert back to wild-type virulence. This not only puts the vaccinee at risk, but if shed can put those that are unvaccinated at risk as well. While these vaccines have been successful there still remains a need for a rational design strategy by which to create additional LAVs.",

Increased fi delity decreases the viral mutational frequency thereby reducing the genetic variation the virus needs in order to evade the host imposed bottlenecks to infection. While polymerase mutants exist which decrease viral mutation frequency the mutations are not in conserved regions of the polymerase, which doesn't lend itself toward using a common mutant approach toward developing a universal vaccine strategy for all RNA viruses. We have identifi ed a conserved lysine residue in the active site of the PV RdRp that acts as a general acid during nucleotide incorporation. Mutation from a lysine to an arginine results in a high fi delity polymerase that replicates slowly thus creating an attenuated virus that is genetically stable and less likely to revert to a wild-type phenotype. This chapter provides detailed methods in which to identify the conserved lysine residue and evaluating fi delity and attenuation in cell culture (in vitro) and in the PV transgenic murine model (in vivo).",

These viruses have an average mutation rate of 10 \u22123 to 10 \u22125 mutations per genome replication event [ 4 ] . As a result, RNA viruses do not replicate as a single sequence but as a \"cloud\" of mutant genomes, which have been dubbed quasispecies [ 9 -12 ] . Although a high mutation rate can lead to deleterious changes in the genome, genetic diversity in RNA virus populations appears to be critical for fi tness and survival and likely contributes to pathogenesis. In a heterogeneous pathogen population, some variants are able to infect primary tissues and bypass host-imposed bottlenecks. From here the remaining variants can replicate into another heterogeneous population where some are once again able to bypass another layer of bottlenecks and perform secondary infection in other tissues thus demonstrating that a heterogeneous population, or quasispecies, can be benefi cial to the pathogen. This adaptability poses a unique challenge, for example, when it comes to developing antiviral drugs and vaccines.",

This family consists of non-enveloped, positive single strand genomes many of which are important human and animal pathogens. The PV genome can be divided into three parts, the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR), a single open reading frame (ORF), and the polyadenylated 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR). Upon entry into the cell, the mRNA is translated as a polyprotein of approximately 3000 amino acids and can be divided into three functionally different regions: P1, P2, and P3. The polyprotein is cleaved cotranslationally and posttranslationally by viral proteases 2A pro and 3C pro into 11 proteins. The PV RdRP is found in the P3 region and is termed 3Dpol.",

Combine two packages of powdered media and 4.8 g of sodium bicarbonate into 1 L of ddH2  O. Adjust pH to 7.2 with concentrate HCl. 7. Inside a serological hood, fi lter media with 0.22 \u03bcm bottle top fi lter into autoclave 1 L pyrex media bottle. Next, prepare 2 % agarose solution using low melt agarose and ddH 2 O. Make a 10 mL, 2 % solution for every 6-well plate prepared. Using a 500 mL Erlenmeyer fl ask, heat agarose mixture in microwave and be careful that solution doesn't boil over the top of the fl ask. Once all of the agarose is in solution, place in 37 \u00b0C water bath until cool enough to comfortably hold. 8. When cooled, add 20 % FBS and 200 U/mL of both penicillin and streptomycin then add the 2\u00d7 media to fi nal volume. Complete 2\u00d7 media and 2 % agarose solution is at a 1:1 volume ratio in order to make fi nal solution 1\u00d7 complete DMEM and 1 % agarose. Completed agarose overlay can remain in the water bath until cells are ready. 9. After 2 h, cover cells with 3 mL of agarose overlay per well. Allow agarose to solidify at room temperature before incubating the plates at 37 \u00b0C for 2 days. 10. After 2 days of incubation, \"pop\" agarose plugs with metal spatula being careful not to scratch the cell monolayer. Once removed, wash cells with 1 mL 1\u00d7 PBS. Remove PBS and add 500 \u03bcL of crystal violet stain. Let stand for 5 min, remove crystal violet and again wash with 1 mL 1\u00d7 PBS. Count plaques to determine virus titer in pfu/mL. 1. One day before, seed 100 mm plate with 3 \u00d7 10 6 HeLa S3 cells. 2. Next day, prepare 100 mm plate by removing media and washing once with 1\u00d7 PBS. Add 9 mL of complete media to plate and put to the side. 3. Follow procedure for RNA transfection ( see RNA transfection). 4. Add 1 mL of transfected cell mixture to HeLa cell monolayer and incubate at 37 \u00b0C until you observe cytopathic effects (CPE) under a light microscope. Complete CPE should be observed after 48 h (cells will be completely detached from the bottom of the plate and fl oating around in the media). 5. Upon CPE, harvest virus and cells into 15 mL conical and freeze on dry ice. Once frozen, thaw in 37 \u00b0C water bath then vortex for 30 s. Repeat this procedure two more times until you have performed \"3 freeze-thaw cycles.\" 6. Remove cell debris by centrifugation at top speed for 10 min. Pour off supernatant into a new 15 mL conical tube. Freeze on dry ice and store at \u221280 \u00b0C until ready to use ( see Note 5 ). 7. This virus culture is labeled as passage 0 (P0). 8. To titer virus, prepare a 6-well plate, the day before, with 6 \u00d7 10 5 HeLa S3 cells per well and cover with 3 mL complete media. 9. Next day, serially dilute virus in PBS. Place 100 \u03bcL of virus mixture on cells in 6-well plates. Allow the virus to adsorb to the cells for 30 min. 10. After 30 min, remove virus and wash cells with 1 mL 1\u00d7 PBS. 11. Remove PBS and replace with complete media containing 1 % agarose ( see Infectious center assay for how to make overlay ). 12. Allow agarose to solidify at room temperature before incubating the plates at 37 \u00b0C for 2 days. 13. After 2 days, \"pop\" agarose plugs with metal spatula being careful not to scratch the cell monolayer. Once removed, wash cells with 1 mL 1\u00d7 PBS. Remove PBS and add 500 \u03bcL of crystal violet stain. Let stand for 5 min, remove crystal violet and again wash with 1 mL 1\u00d7 PBS. Count plaques to determine virus titer in pfu/mL. 14. Also extract RNA using QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit to quantitate genome copies/mL by RTqPCR ( see Fecundity assay on how to prepare the standard curve of RTqPCR ). 15. To make additional viral passages: One day before, seed 100 mm plate with 3 \u00d7 10 6 HeLa S3 cells. 16. Next day, prepare 100 mm plate by removing media and washing once with 1\u00d7 PBS. Remove PBS and add 2 mL of fresh 1\u00d7 PBS. 17. Inoculate cells with virus at MOI 0.01. Allow virus to adsorb to cells for 30 min, wash with 1\u00d7 PBS and add 10 mL of complete to plate. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C until CPE is observed (with WT PV CPE should be observed after 24 h, time to CPE mutants will vary). 18. Titer by plaque assay and quantitate genome copies/mL. 19. Keep passaging virus in this manor until you have reached the desired passage number. Sequence the 3Dpol gene to check for stability of the engineered mutation ( see Note 6 ). 20. To analyze one-step virus growth, infected cells with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 10. Allow virus to adsorb to cells for 30 min and wash with 1\u00d7 PBS then add 1 mL of complete media to cells.",
