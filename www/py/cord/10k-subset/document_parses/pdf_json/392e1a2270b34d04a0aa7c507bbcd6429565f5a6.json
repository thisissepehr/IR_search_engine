In most cases the bleeding will be from the uterus, either because of uterine atony, retained placental fragments, or an invasive placenta. A low abdominal aortogram is usually performed to evaluate the vascularity, and then selective and if possible supraselective catheterization is performed to evaluate the branches of the internal iliac artery. The uterine arteries are usually still large and can be catheterize, usually without the need for microcatheters. In most cases with placement of a 5 French catheter, a Gelfoam slurry or large Gelfoam pieces can be administered. A Gelfoam slurry can be produced by placing cut up pieces of Gelfoam in a 10 ml syringe and attached to a 3-way stopcock with another syringe containing contrast. The Gelfoam-contrast solution is passed back-and-forth until the pieces are broken down into a slurry and then the slurry is injected with small syringes through the catheter into the artery. This solution is injected until the artery is occluded. Then the opposite artery is catheterized and occluded. Gelfoam can also be cut into larger particles (torpedoes) and injected individually through the catheter until stasis is achieved. Although coils, PVA, and cyanoacrylate glue have all been used in postpartum hemorrhage, there is no reason in most cases to use these materials since just being able to temporarily slow down the uterine blood flow is the primary requirement of the embolization. Gelfoam slurry or pledglets have the potential for recanalization which is ideal in women who may desire future pregnancies. In some cases the bleeding may be coming from vaginal or cervical branches due to lacerations from the delivery. Occasionally deep lacerations may cause a retroperitoneal hematoma, which can allow substantial blood loss leading to shock. In these cases catheterization of the more proximal uterine artery with embolization with a Gelfoam slurry can be performed, or a microcatheter may be used to more selectively embolize the bleeding vessel. Usually Gelfoam is most appropriate as an embolic, but potentially a small amount of particulate agent, or a microcoil could be used for the embolization. If bleeding is occurring because of an invasive placenta, it is possible that the cervix, vagina, pelvic sidewalls and bladder may be involved in a placenta percreta. This may require supraselective embolization or less selective anterior division embolization if there are multiple bleeding sites. If a hysterectomy has been performed, then bleeding maybe coming from an uterine artery (potentially a slipped ligature) but maybe coming from other branches of the internal iliac artery. Uterine artery supply can also rarely originate from a branch of the distal external iliac artery, or from the round artery that can originate from the inferior epigastric artery. In addition, it is possible that in the course of the postpartum hysterectomy that the ovarian artery has been damaged or there has been the development of collaterals from the ovarian artery. Since bleeding from this artery will not be identified on a pelvic angiogram it is important to have a high level of suspicion if the patient continues to show evidence of bleeding when no bleeding is identified on the internal iliac injections or following embolization. Bleeding can occur along the course of the ovarian artery since it may be caused by retractor injury. In some cases extravasation of contrast may not be evident. Extravasation is more common if there is a vaginal or cervical laceration. Usually embolization is performed at least of the uterine artery even if bleeding is not identified. In some cases the arteries may be so small because of vasoconstriction due to hypotension, that it may not be possible to access the uterine artery and proximal anterior division embolization may be required. In these cases one should avoid embolizing the superior gluteal artery since buttock ischemia has been described as a complication of embolization for postpartum hemorrhage. Both uterine arteries, or anterior divisions should probably be embolized. If the superior gluteal arises as a very early branch and it is a risk for embolization, then there could be consideration of placing a proximal coil in the artery to prevent embolization of the buttock area.",

            "text": "Late postpartum hemorrhage, which by definition occurs more than 24 hours after the delivery, may still be caused by genital lacerations that manifest late, or retention of products of conception. These can usually be treated by Gelfoam just as if they were within the early time period. In addition, the bleeding maybe caused by the development of an AV fistula or a pseudoaneurysm that develops in the myometrium. Embolization in these cases is usually less emergent, as the bleeding is less. Embolization materials are different in these cases. The AV fistula may appear more like an AV malformation as it recruits multiple feeding vessels. In these cases a permanent embolization material is required. Depending on the flow patterns a particulate agent is not appropriate because of the arterial venous shunting. Cyanoacrylate glue or Onyx is a better choice because of the permanent nature of the embolization, and the ability to penetrate more distally. Since a pseudoaneurysm is usually more distally in the uterine artery, it is also usually better treated by glue embolization which allows the embolization to occur more distally. However, if the pseudoaneurysm is more proximal it might be embolized with a coil, again a permanent embolic agent. Both uterine arteries need to be evaluated in these conditions. It is not unlikely that both uterine arteries might require treatment because of the cross collateral nature of the blood flow in the uterus. Recurrence after embolization can occur. In some cases there is recanalization. In other cases, ovarian collaterals have developed. If there is a recurrence, the first approach would be to study the internal iliac branches, but if there is no evidence of bleeding then evaluation of the ovarian arteries needs to be performed. Complications of embolization can occur but with careful technique they should be minimized. Ischemic complications that have been reported include uterine necrosis, vaginal fistula, muscle pain, buttock ischemia, neurological damage (primarily sciatica) and perforation or occlusion of the external iliac artery. Post-procedural fever can also occur, but this seems to be more likely either a consequence of endometritis from previous manipulations, or a post-embolization syndrome.",

            "text": "Learning Objectives: 1. To learn about the specific problems of iliac stenoses involving the aortic bifurcation 2. To learn about the incidence of recurrent stenoses in this location 3. To learn the possible concepts of treating these lesions Aortic occlusion begins with atherosclerotic disease at and around the aortic bifurcation. As this process becomes progressive, the aortic stenosis, slow flow, and turbulence promote thrombus formation that completes the occlusion proximally as far as a significant outflow branch, often the inferior mesenteric or renal arteries (1) . Thus, the aortoiliac occlusion is a combination of juxta-bifurcation aortic wall plaque and organized thrombus. This extensive aortic wall disease with heavy thrombus burden presents a particularly difficult challenge for any catheter-based reconstruction and requires both, high operator skill levels and state-of-the-art endovascular tools. Therefore, at many institutions the traditional approach to revascularization in aortoiliac disease is still surgical. Aortobifemoral bypass grafting was established over four decades ago as the intervention of choice for patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (2) . In patients fit enough to tolerate laparotomy, aortobifemoral bypass is the operation of choice. Patients at greater surgical risk are candidates for axillofemoral bypass grafting with acceptable patency rates, a less stressful procedure with a shorter recovery time (3, 4) . The rise of endovascular treatment techniques for revascularization has resulted in innovative applications of this new technology to provide less invasive options for this patient population. In 1995 it was still stated after publishing initial experience with endovascular graft repair of complex arterial lesions that the obtained results justifies further use and careful evaluation of this technique for major arterial reconstruction (5) and some years later first data reporting primary stent implantation with the kissing balloon technique is safe and effective for the treatment of aortoiliac obstructions involving the aortic bifurcation as a true endovascular alternative to surgery became available (6) . Today, there are no differences between the aortofemoral bypass and aortoiliac stenting groups with respect to long-term rates of mortality, amputation, or revision procedures (7) . Looking closer to data obtained from endovascular treatment, which should be nowadays kept in mind as an optional first treatment approach, technical success rates and cumulative patency rates are encouraging for a successful and lasting revascularization. Martinez et al published their results of aortic stenting in 24 patients, 6 of whom had total aortic occlusion (8) . At 5-year follow-up, they had a cumulative patency of 100%. Stoeckelhuber et al had a smaller series with longer follow-up, also demonstrating 100% patency (9) . Either the use of self-expanding stents or balloon-expandable stents is described. A recent article comparing outcomes of covered kissing stent placement compared with bare metal stent placement in the treatment of atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the aortic bifurcation could prove that the use of covered balloon-expandable kissing stents for atherosclerotic aortic bifurcation occlusive disease provides superior patency at 2 years as compared with bare metal balloon-expandable stents (10) .",

            "text": "Although there have been previous descriptions of endoprostheses for the treatment of aortoiliac disease (11, 12) . Even the reconstruction of the totally occluded aortoiliac bifurcation in patients suffering from Leriche syndrome by endoluminal means was shown to be feasible and safe and associated with excellent mid-term clinical outcomes (13) . In opposite to the conventional kissing stent technique, T-stenting may serve as an alternative with small protrusion technique (TAPstenting) for stenosed aortoiliac bifurcations with small abdominal aortas. This technique is described as follows: a large, self-expanding stent was implanted from the lower aorta to one iliac branch, followed by deployment of a balloon-expandable stent in the contralateral iliac artery such that its proximal edge protruded a few millimetres through the struts of the self-expanding stent into the aorta [TAP (T And Protrude)-stenting technique] (14) . In case of dissections involving the aortic bifurcation or failures to get in to the true lumen at the level of the aorta can be handled today using so-called re-entry devices. The technical success rate is possible 100%, facilitated by the use of the Outback\u2122 catheter for accurate wire re-entry (15) . When managing stenoses involving aorta and aortic bifurcation, repair of the concomitant femoral occlusive disease is often needed regardless of open or endovascular treatment and infrainguinal disease negatively affects the durability of the procedure and patient survival (16) . Long-term data after aortoiliac kissing stent procedures showed in multivariate analysis, age <50 years and presence of iliac occlusion were identified as risk factors for reduced primary and assisted primary patency; a crossed configuration of kissing stents was identified as a risk factor for reduced primary patency (17) . Last but not least, failure of kissing stents in the aortic bifurcation may be significantly increased by the overlap of the free proximal stent ends in the distal aorta (18) . Keeping this in mind endovascular management of stenoses involving aorta and aortic bifurcation is a suitable, less invasive alternative to aortofemoral bypass surgery for the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease. However, one has to keep in mind, these patients suffer from a high overall mortality due to other cardiovascular causes (19) .",

Many of these patients (perhaps 30-50%) will have had sexual dysfunction before surgery, it is estimated that up to 25% will have problems related to the surgery. In addition, the life expectancy of these patients is restricted compared to an age-matched control. At 5 and 10 years, 25% and 50% of patients will be dead (1, 4) . Extra-anatomical reconstruction has not found favour because of limited patency and higher infection rates. However, in sick patients and those with hostile abdomen there may be no alternative. Femoro-femoral bypass may be used when there is good inflow to the contralateral femoral artery. The surgery is fairly well tolerated with 30-day mortality of around 0-6% (4, (8) (9) (10) . However, critical investigation demonstrates that other complications affect recovery in 22% of patients, in particular graft occlusion, re-operation, bleeding, wound infection, lymph fistula, femoral nerve numbness, penile swelling, DVT, MI, chest infection and stroke (11) . Primary patency at 1, 3 and 5 years is around 90%, 75% and 70%, respectively (8) (9) (10) . Graft infection remains a persistent concern occurring in around 6% of patients. Most patients will be treated for CLI and in this group 40% will be dead at 5yrs. The donor iliac system frequently has significant disease. Whilst there is some debate as to whether donor iliac endovascular intervention affects patency of the graft, it is likely that if the disease is short segment (less than 5cm) then angioplasty probably does not affect outcome. However, where there is more lengthy disease then patency is expected to be reduced (12) . Axillo-bifemoral procedures are generally performed when nothing else is possible. Most patients will have been treated for CLI or infected intra-abdominal grafts. The 30-day mortality is reported as 2-18% with a 3-year patency of between 40 and 70% (10) .",

            "text": "From the early days of Interventional Radiology endovascular intervention upon the aorta and iliac arteries has been recognised as an attractive alternative to surgical intervention. Endovascular intervention is safe and the majority of patients can be treated as a day case. The BIAS registry reviewed 4295 cases of iliac intervention and demonstrated that in the UK the overall procedural mortality is 2%, but only 0.2% in claudicants. Other complications were rare including distal embolisation (0.5-0.8%), groin haematoma (1.2%) and unplanned surgery (0.7%). There were only 2 iliac artery ruptures (13) . Infra-renal aortic stenosis is uncommon and tends to occur in overweight heavy smoking short women. For a long time this has been treated with angioplasty or stent placement but, because the lesions are uncommon, the number of reported cases is small. Patency is high; 70-90% at 4 years (14) . Simple angioplasty for short iliac stenoses is a simple procedure with almost 100% technical success. The long-term patency at 1, 3 and 5 years is 75-95%, 60-90% and 60-80%, respectively (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Whilst there are no randomised data to show that stents confer benefit over simple angioplasty when treating stenoses, a meta-analysis did show that stents improve the technical success rate, have a similar complication rate (also demonstrated by the BIAS registry) and have a 39% reduction in the risk of long-term failure (20) . Bilateral common iliac stenoses cause concern regarding the use of kissing balloon angioplasty or kissing stents. The incidence of prolapse of the atheroma from one iliac artery to another is actually very low but since both sides would probably require treatment anyway a kissing technique is probably required. Since there are no good data to show benefit of stents over simple angioplasty it is this author's preference to use kissing angioplasty. However, if kissing stents are to be used then the long-term data are also excellent with patencies at 1, 3 and 5 years of around 76-97%, 58-86% and 63-82% (21) . The Dutch Iliac Stent Trial is worthy of mention (22) . Patients with claudication and predominantly iliac stenoses were randomised to either primary stent placement or angioplasty and subsequent stent placement if there was a residual gradient. Neither arm had clinical benefit but selective stenting was cheaper. The trial was based upon the premise that a residual gradient produces a worse long-term outcome and requires placement of a stent. Unfortunately there are no data to confirm that premise and therefore this was largely a trial of stent versus PTA. Until stents became routinely available iliac occlusions were treated by simple angioplasty. Two large series show similar clinical and patency outcomes as when treating occlusions but there was a high rate of distal embolisation. When stents suitable for iliac arteries were developed they became routine use in occlusions with the hope of scaffolding back the bulk of disease and improving patency. There were, however, no good supportive data. Non-randomised data show a primary success of 92-97% and primary patency at 2 and 5 years of 75-87% and 75-65% (23) (24) (25) . A number of factors have been demonstrated to adversely affect long-term patency, in particular CLI rather than claudication, external iliac occlusions, and female sex (20, 23, 24, (26) (27) (28) (29) . Since external iliacs are small and women have smaller arteries than men I suspect that the outcome is principally affected by the clinical presentation and size of artery treated. The results of the STAG trial were released at CIRSE 2010. This trial randomised patients with iliac occlusions to either primary stent or angioplasty with stent placement only if there was no flow following deflation of the balloon. The study showed; 1. higher major complication rate following angioplasty alone, largely due to distal embolisation, 2. better long-term patency following stent placement (93% at 2 years), 3. the same clinical outcomes. Because of the efficacy and safety of using endovascular techniques to manage simple disease (TASC A and B) practitioners have extended the range to include very complex disease (TASC C and D) (30) . A recent systematic review has demonstrated that even in extreme disease the mortality ranges from 0 to 6.7% and the primary patency at 4 and 5 years are reported as 60 to 86% (31) . Despite the reduced patency rates compared to aorto-bifemoral grafts in complex patterns of disease endovascular intervention remains popular because; 1. Patency rates remain acceptable. 2. The procedural and long term complications are markedly reduced compared to open surgery. 3. Treatment can generally be done as a day case. Recommendations 1. In general, patients with peripheral arterial disease are frail and carry a high co-morbidity. It makes sense therefore to treat patients, where possible, using endovascular techniques since these have a low procedural complication rate and acceptable patency rate when compared to open surgery. 2. Stents should be routinely used in iliac and aortic occlusions.",

            "text": "3. An aorto-bifemoral graft should be at least considered in the relatively young and healthy with a disease pattern that is difficult to manage with endovascular techniques, e.g. aortic occlusion, bilateral iliac occlusions, women with small arteries and diffuse disease. 4 . Extra-anatomic surgery should be restricted to critical limb ischaemia when other treatment options have been exhausted. Unlike the well-documented progression of aortic aneurysms, there are no large-scale prospective studies that have investigated the natural history of IAAs. In the most comprehensive retrospective review of the natural history of IAAs, expansion rates were found to be slow for IAAs smaller than 3 cm (0.11 mm/year) and significantly greater and similar to the rate of expansion for AAA in that size range for IAAs 3 to 5 cm (26 mm/year) (1) . The average size of the aneurysms at the time of discovery is 5 to 6 cm (1) . As with aortic aneurysms, size appears to be the most important rupture determinant. In large series, the average size of ruptured IAA has been estimated to be 5.6 cm (3) . Mortality from emergent repair for rupture in reports from the last 20 years is approximately 28%; ranging from 0% to 60%. In the same series, mortality for elective repair is approximately 5%: ranging from 0% to 50% (1) . Based on the available data on the natural history of IAAs, aneurysms that are 3 to 3.5 cm should be carefully followed with ultrasound or computerized tomographic (CT) scanning at 6-month intervals, whereas elective repair should be considered for IAAs 3.5 cm or larger. Symptomatic IAAs and those larger than 5 cm should be expeditiously repaired (1) . Diagnosing isolated iliac artery aneurysms can be difficult. Frequently, the physical examination is unrevealing. Occasionally, abdominal and pelvic X-rays will reveal the calcified wall of an aneurysm in the lower abdomen. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography is an excellent non-invasive imaging modality to demonstrate iliac artery aneurysmal disease. The clinical utility of ultrasound is decreased in the presence of overlying bowel gas or iliac arteries located deep in the pelvis. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography are used widely to establishing the diagnosis and anatomical extent of the iliac artery aneurysms. Open surgery has represented the traditional therapy for iliac aneurysms. An aorto-bi-iliac or aorto-bi-femoral interposition graft may be performed to treat patients with bilateral common iliac aneurysms. Operative treatment of patients with an isolated internal iliac artery aneurysm may consist of proximal ligation only, proximal plus distal ligation, aneurysmectomy with graft interposition, or endoaneurysmorrhaphy (2) . Endovascular repair of common iliac artery aneurysms has become increasingly popular and has been shown to be safe and durable at mid-term follow-up. Endovascular repair typically involves a combination of branch vessel coil embolization and aneurysm exclusion using a stent graft. Before endovascular repair, a CTA of the aortoiliac vessels is obtained to measure the length of the proximal and distal neck, aneurysm size, degree of iliac artery tortuosity, and to determine the patency of the hypogastric arteries. The specifics of the procedure are adapted based on anatomical considerations of aneurysm location and maintenance of adequate pelvic blood flow. Sakamoto et al. and Fahrni et al. each have proposed a working classification that combines anatomical characteristics and endovascular treatment options (4, 5) . For example, a common iliac artery aneurysm <2 cm from the aortic bifurcation (Fahrni Type Ib; Sakamoto Type IV) may be treated with a bifurcated stent graft or a combination of stent graft extending from aorta to nonaneurysmal iliac artery, coil embolization of the contralateral hypogastric artery, ligation of the contralateral external iliac artery, and a femoro-femoral crossover graft to preserve pelvic blood flow. In contrast, for unilateral common iliac artery aneurysm involving the hypogastric artery that has an adequate proximal neck (Fahrni Type Ia; Sakamoto Type III), the ipsilateral hypogastric is coil embolized and a stent graft deployed in the ipsilateral common and external iliac artery (2) . The reported technical success for elective interventional repair is 100%. Primary patency rates at 2 years vary from 81 to 95% and at 3 years from 86 to 97.5% (6) . Reintervention for endoleak and graft/ kinking occlusion varies from 0 to 26% (6) .",

To analyse the results of the different modalities in detection, characterization and staging of HCC Hepatocarcinoma represents the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Its incidence is higher in the developing countries and its rising in Europe and United States equal that observed in Japan is expected in 20 years. Cirrhosis is the main risk factor, and is clearly associated with hepatitis B virus chronic infection in Asia and Africa and hepatitis virus C in Western countries. More recently, the metabolic NASH (non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis) related to diabetes and obesity has been considered to be an increasing risk factor for HCC in developed countries. In the last three decades, surveillance programs and improvement in diagnosis have enabled clinicians to identify tumours at early stage when effective treatment is available and improvement in survival can be reached. Early HCC was defined as tumours less than 3 cm . EASL and AASLD established that nodules larger than 2 cm which are hypervascular on any imaging method may be regarded as HCC and if two imaging techniques show hypervascularity in nodules between 1 and 2 cm it is also regarded as HCC. But some nodules larger than 2 cm are not hypervascular and 10 percent of HCC are iso-or hypovascular. Otherwise some hypervascular nodules larger than 1 cm are not HCC. So recent studies have 339 C RSE CIRSE Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course used sequential imaging and biopsy of indeterminate small nodules to show that a substantial proportion of HCCs of fewer than 2 cm are missed when EASL criteria are applied. Which technique for early HCC diagnosis? US is less sensitive than CT and MRI, although there is some evidence that combining CT and US increases sensitivity. Gd-enhanced MRI is superior to either CT as US. In addition to techniques relying on the parameter of arterial hypervascularity, other indicator of functional assessment using intracellular contrast agents in MRI (EOB-DTPA) was added. Some recent studies recommend to change the main diagnostic modality for HCC smaller than 2 cm from CT arterioportal angiography (considered as a standard) to CEUS and Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI with combined sensitivity as high as 94%.",

To understand the role of intra-arterial transcatheter therapy with respect to other surgical and ablative therapies Early stage HCC can be curably treated or well controlled with local therapies like radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transcatheter intra-arterial therapy. As the transcatheter intra-arterial therapy, both transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) are options can be selected. However, for the treatment of early stage HCC, the superselective TACE using a microcatheter system is the best way because of its stronger power to small lesions comparing with HAIC. For good TACE, \"The complete embolization of the entire tumor\" must be needed. To achieve \"The complete embolization of the entire tumor\", techniques and knowledge as follows are needed. The first is to confirm the main feeding artery of the tumor. For this, we should limit the potential feeding arteries from angiogram via proximal side with stepwise manner. Immediate insertion of microcatheter system into a small artery without confirmation should be avoided. Also, angio-CT helps easing and smoothing the procedure. The second is to recognize that arterial blood to the tumor is never supplied via single artery. If the blood supply from the main feeding artery is stopped, the tumor must receive arterial blood via other small arteries. So, we should know the tumor is floating on the vascular network. This phenomenon occurs easily in hepatic segments border and bare area. Because of this, right sized embolic materials reaching intra-tumor vessels should be infused slowly to avoid making bigger cluster in proximal site before tumor vessels. Also, we should avoid the arterial occlusion or spasm caused by the inserted catheter. When the superselective catheterization is impossible, there is another way to perform the superselective embolization. If arterial branches except the target artery are embolized with temporary embolic materials, we can infuse the embolic materials only into the target artery. For this, the gelatin sponge block adjusted for the proximal size of vessel should be used to avoid the peripheral embolization of the non-tumorous part. A permanent embolic materiallike steel coils should not be used, because there is some possibility of artery to start feeding blood to the tumor in the future. Confirming \"The complete embolization of the entire tumor\" just after TACE is another important issue to get the good outcome. For this, volume image like CT is more useful than DSA image. On CT, we must check any defect of lipiodol accumulation or contrast media in the tumor. With defects, the TACE is incomplete, then, we must seek other feeding arteries. The accumulation of lipiodol in the portal vein branches around the tumor means lower recurrence rates than its absence. Also, we should know the importance of not only complete embolization via the arterial side but also the complete blockage of blood supply to the tumor, because the tumor sometimes survives with blood supply via the portal vein when arterial supply is stopped. Reported CR ratio of definitely hypervascular HCC are around 30-60% by superselective TACE with lipiodol for hypervascular HCC less than 5 cm. According to a nationwide survey by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan (LCSGJ), overall 5-year survival rate was 26% in patients with HCCs not indicated for surgery or RFA. From these data, we should recognize that hypervascular early stage HCC is the good candidate for superselective TACE, but non-hypervascular HCC is not good candidate for this treatment option. With respect to other surgical and ablative therapies, the important point is that RFA and superselective TACE easily can be repeated because of their limited invasiveness. Therefore, RFA and TACE are good candidates for patients with potential to occur multiple lesions after local treatment. The selection of RFA and superselective TACE should be decided based on the tumor vascularity, location and size. When hypervascular HCC locates in difficult places for percutaneous RFA, TACE is the most suitable option. In summary, the indication of superselective TACE should be decided by tumor vascularity and the difficulty of percutaneous RFA. The most important technical point to perform superselective TACE for early stage HCC is understanding of the feature of blood supply to the tumor and the arterial network of the liver, using adequate techniques and the confirmation of our procedure completion.

            "text": "Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss design of recent multicenter clinical trials on HCC 2. To present results of recent trials on HCC 3. To understand the role of new therapies or combination of therapies in the management of HCC The term \"image-guided tumor ablation\" is defined as the direct application of chemical or thermal therapies to a specific focal tumor (or tumors) in an attempt to achieve eradication or substantial tumor destruction. Although tumor ablation procedures can be performed at laparoscopy or surgery, most procedures aimed at treating HCC are performed with a percutaneous approach. Hence, several authors refer to these procedures as \"percutaneous therapies\". The concept of image guidance is stressed in the title to highlight that image guidance is critical to the success of these therapies. Over the past 25 years, several methods for chemical or thermal tumor destruction have been developed and clinically tested. More recently, new options that use novel, non-chemical non-thermal ablative techniques have started clinical investigation. The seminal technique used for chemical ablation of HCC has been percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI). RFA has been the most widely assessed alternative to PEI for local ablation of HCC. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared RFA versus PEI for the treatment of early-stage HCC. These investigations consistently showed that RFA has higher anticancer effect than PEI, leading to a better local control of the disease. However, even in small tumors, the ability of RFA to achieve a complete tumour eradication appears to be dependent on tumor location. Histological studies performed in liver specimens of patients who underwent RFA as bridge treatment to transplantation showed that the presence of large (3 mm or more) abutting vessels result in a drop of the rate of complete tumor necrosis to less than 50%, because of the heat loss due to perfusion-mediated tissue cooling within the area to be ablated. MWA is emerging as a valuable alternative to RFA for thermal ablation of HCC. However, only one RCT has compared the effectiveness of MWA with that of RFA so far. It has to be pointed out, however, that MWA technology has evolved significantly since the publication of this trial. Newer devices seem to overcome the limitation of the small volume of coagulation that was obtained with a single probe insertion in early experiences. To date, few data are available concerning the clinical efficacy of laser ablation, as the treatment has been adopted by few centers worldwide. In particular, no RCTs to compare laser ablation with any other treatment have been published thus far. Cryoablation also had limited application in HCC. There are currently no RCTs that support the use of hepatic cryoablation for HCC treatment. New, non-chemical non-thermal image-guided ablation techniques are currently undergoing clinical investigation. These include irreversible electroporation (IRE) and light-activated drug therapy. These techniques promise to overcome some of the limitations of chemical and thermal-based techniques in the treatment of HCC. IRE is a method to induce irreversible disruption of cell membrane integrity resulting in cell death without the need for additional pharmacological injury. IRE is administered under general anesthesia with administration of atracurium, cis-atracurium, pancuronium or an equivalent neuromuscular blocking agent to prevent undesirable muscle contraction. IRE creates a sharp boundary between the treated and untreated area in vivo. This would suggest that IRE has the ability to sharply delineate the treatment area from the non-treated, and that treatment planning can be precisely performed according to mathematical predictions. In addition, IRE can effectively create tissue death in micro-to millisecond ranges of treatment time compared to thermal ablation techniques, which require at least 20 minutes to hours. Moreover, because IRE is a non-thermal technique, there appears to be complete ablation to the margin of blood vessels without compromising the functionality of the blood vessels. Therefore, issues associated with perfusion-mediated tissue cooling or heating (a significant challenge with thermal methods) are not relevant. Preclinical investigation focused on HCC has shown promising results. Light-activated drug therapy uses light-emitting diodes to activate talaporfin sodium, a small drug molecule which is synthesized from a chlorophyll derivative. Talaporfin sodium has the capacity to concentrate in tumors when administered intravenously. It is then activated by a thin light emitting activator which is percutaneously inserted intratumorally under imaging guidance. The drug is capable of absorbing long wavelength light resulting in singlet oxygen that causes apoptotic cell death through oxidation and permanent tumor blood vessel closure. Experimental studies suggest that singlet oxygen causes the destruction of all cells within the kill zone. Potential advantages of light-activated drug therapy with talaporfin sodium include the accurate prediction of the size of the kill zone by illumination time and fluence, the independency of treatment effect from tumor histotype and tumor location and the ability to treat large or multiple tumors in a single session requiring only mild sedation.

Prior to its publication, the CIRSE Executive Committee and the SIR Executive Council endorsed the document. The benefits of interventional radiology to patients are extensive and beyond dispute, but many of these procedures also have the potential to produce patient radiation doses high enough to cause radiation effects and occupational doses to interventional radiologists high enough to cause concern. The guideline on occupational radiation protection (RP) is a complement to the existing on patient radiation management [2] and it is intended to help minimize occupational radiation dose. The radiation dose received by interventional radiologists can vary by more than an order of magnitude for the same type of procedure and for similar patient dose. Recently, there has been particular concern regarding occupational dose to the lens of the eye in interventionalists [3] . Occupational RP is especially important for image-guided medical procedures and requires both the appropriate education and training for the interventional radiologist and the availability of appropriate protection tools and equipment. Occupational RP are necessary for all individuals who work in the interventional fluoroscopy suite. This includes not only technologists and nurses, who spend a substantial amount of time in a radiation environment, but also anesthesiologists.",

However, some of them are unaware that they may be exposing patients to relatively high levels of radiation during interventional procedures. While staff protection is definitely important, there are more serious issues of patient protection in interventional procedures using X rays. Despite being among the most active users of X-rays, many interventionalists and especially cardiologists have either no training or inadequate training in radiation protection [1] . When fluoroscopicguided interventions began, specialist clinicians such as cardiologists became increasingly involved in performing such procedures; however, adequate training in radiological physics and radiation protection was not implemented. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) states that interventional procedures are complex and demanding and tend to be operator dependant, thus it is particularly important that individuals performing the procedure is both in clinical techniques and knowledge of radiation protection [2] . In 2009, CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and SIR Safety and Health Committee have published \"Guidelines for Patient Radiation Dose Management\" [3] . Recently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American College of Physicians (ACC/ AHA/ACP) Task Force on Clinical Competence and Training published a report clearly delineating the need for the radiation safety knowledge base for cardiology staff [4] . In compliance with EC requirements, similar guidelines for specific training in radiation protection were developed in Europe [5] .

            "text": "The basic principles of minimizing radiation exposure to the patient during interventional procedures include [3, 4, 6, 7] : Minimize beam-on time, both for fluoroscopy and acquisition. The fluoroscopic beam should be on only when the dynamic information from the fluoroscopy image is being actively utilized. Never irradiate the patient unless the primary operator's eyes are on the monitor. The last image hold feature can be used to study many anatomic details without the need for ongoing radiation exposure. The number of acquisition runs should be held to the minimum consistent with accurate diagnosis and effective conduct of a therapeutic procedure. Use optimal beam collimation. Collimation should be used actively to limit the X-ray beam size to the minimum area needed for effective procedure conduct. Fluoroscopy with the collimator leaves wide open delivers unnecessary radiation to both the patient and to clinical personnel. Position the X-ray source and image receptor optimally. The X-ray system should be positioned so that the distance from the patient to the image detector is minimized. It is usually clinically desirable to position patient's area of interest near imaging system's isocenter. Having patient's area of interest in the isocenter facilitates keeping it at the center of the field despite changes in angulated views, without the need for prolonged fluoroscopy to adjust patient's position with each change in angiographic projection. Another benefit of having the patient positioned correctly straight on the table is that certain cardiovascular structures can be reliably found with respect to skeletal and tracheobronchial landmarks with minimal trial and error or wasted fluoroscopy. Given this constraint, the distance between the X-ray tube and patient should be practicably maximized (some designs permit the independent control of this distance, while others do not). Do not use fluoroscopy to make changes to the patient/table position or collimators/shields. The patient should be moved first to the approximate desired location, then fluoroscopy should be used very briefly to check the position, followed by further patient adjustment, rather than using fluoroscopy constantly during patient movement. This is especially important when the patient needs to be moved by an assistant during the case (e.g., to reposition the arms in a different fashion). Do not apply fluoroscopy while the assistant is manipulating the patient. Many units have \"virtual\" markers that enable the positioning of collimators and partial thickness shields without the need for fluoroscopy by indicating their location on the screen. Even in units that do not have virtual markers, the collimators should still be moved first and checked for position with brief fluoroscopy; they should not be positioned during constant fluoroscopic visualization. Use the least degree of image magnification required for accurate interpretation. For X-ray systems that use conventional image 343 C RSE CIRSE Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course intensifiers, the dose generally increases substantially with increasing magnification. Depending on operating parameters, flat-panel detector systems may have a smaller dose increment with magnification. The least degree of image magnification that is consistent with accurate interpretation should be used. Understand and utilize the X-ray dose-reduction features provided by the X-ray unit. Employing a sophisticated unit's dosereduction features can substantially reduce dose. Use the slowest fluoroscopy pulse rate and the lowest fluoroscopy dose rate that will produce satisfactory images. Use high-dose fluoroscopy only when the enhanced image quality it provides is absolutely necessary. Use the slowest acquisition frame rate that is adequate for diagnosis. Employ beamhardening filters whenever feasible. Vary the site of the radiation entrance port. During procedures that require long fluoroscopy times, if clinically feasible, change the radiographic projection so as to minimize the dose to any particular portion of entrance port skin.",

The dose at the interventional reference point (IRP) is a measure of deterministic risk. The DAP delivered to a patient during a procedure is both a measure of stochastic risk and a potential quality indicator. Physicians should be made aware of the exposures they deliver to their patients and how they compare to established norms. For older units that do not provide this function, the total fluoroscopy and acquisition times should be recorded. The purchase of accessory dose monitors should also be considered for such equipment. Maintain X-ray equipment in good repair and calibration. A qualified medical physicist should periodically check equipment calibration (both radiation levels and image quality factors). Patient input doses for both fluoroscopy and acquisition should be set at the lowest values that are consistent with satisfactory image quality. A qualified medical physicist should periodically verify dose and image quality performance for fluoroscopy and acquisition as part of the laboratory's quality assurance program. These settings will produce images with detectable noise. Operators should recognize that a good image contains a degree of noise and should not request calibrations that produce completely smooth images. Aging image intensifiers have reduced light output for a given X-ray input dose. Thus, an aging image intensifier will automatically require the X-ray system to deliver an increased dose. Such image intensifiers should be replaced. Select X-ray units with sophisticated dose-reduction and monitoring features. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has published a standard22 defining the minimum necessary safety equipment for interventional fluoroscopes. At the time of this writing, the FDA has proposed adding most of these elements to all newly manufactured fluoroscopic units. Additional radiation and other patient or staff safety components may be available. Their use is encouraged. Operators should be well-experienced and well-rested. Efficient minimisation of radiation exposure in invasive cardiology requires both adequately experienced and well-rested interventionists. Radiation exposure to patients resulting from PCI is influenced by fatigue and significantly roses -due to more and longer radiographic runs -after the cardiologists workload amounts to more than 6 h. As a consequence, elective PCI should be scheduled for the first 6 h of workload whereas diagnostic interventions may be safely scheduled later. ",

To learn about the different techniques (passive and active) to reduce the patient's radiation exposures Dose management in pediatric population varies depending on the age of the child. In fact, it is more about the size and is very different from the dose management in adults. Pediatric interventional radiology specializes in minimally invasive diagnostic or interventional procedures using imaging guidance, in children. Interventional procedures in children should be absolutely justified and radiation exposure in young children must be lower than in adults (1) . Newborns are estimated to be 10 to 40 times more sensitive to radiation than adults. Mortality risk in newborn males is about 0.12% to 0.15% /10 mSv. Females are more vulnerable due to greater breast and thyroid tissue sensitivity. In addition, because of smaller body size, a greater portion of a child's radiosensitive tissues is in close proximity to the X-ray beam during fluoroscopy-guided interventions (2) . Small body size is of some advantage as radiation penetrates small children more readily, keeping relatively low dose rates. The risk of inducing a cancer in a child following prolonged procedure with very long fluoroscopy time (60 minutes) and from an interventional cardiovascular procedure that delivers 60 min of fluoroscopy and equal dose from fluorography is very high between 0.1 and 1% reliant on the angiography system dose efficiency. Variety of image-guided interventional procedures can be performed in children vascular and non-vascular. Vast majority is fluoroscopy-guided and some are CT guided. Clearly preprocedural imaging that does not require use of ionizing radiation, like ultrasound or MRI (MRA) should be preferred in all cases. Good and well controlled sedation or general anesthesia should be a routine not only regarding the pain and anxiety management but also the dose management. Well controlled relax patient requires less fluoroscopy and less retakes during DSA runs. There was no correlation found between fluoroscopy time and measured entrance dose, but strong correlation between cumulative skin dose and patient weight (3, 4) .",

            "text": "Justification of Fluoroscopy and CT-guided interventions in children The use of IR procedures in children is likely to expand and become more complex and time consuming. They should always be individually justified and accurately planned. Clinically justified balance between the risk and the benefit is necessary. It is important to have a history of previous procedures. IR has to determine that the procedure is necessary relying on the natural history of the disease, and the risks and benefits of other available therapeutic options (5) . Whenever possible the US guidance should be preferred, especially in access and various drainage procedures, fluoroscopy should be kept to a necessary minimum. Image gently campaign is aimed to change the IR practice by increasing awareness of the opportunities to lower the radiation dose in children (6) . Optimization (Passive and Active radiation protection) We usually divide the radiation protection methods to passive and active. This terminology can be valid for both patient and staff protection. Passive protection is about the available X-Ray system. Each angiography system used for pediatric patients necessitates appropriate settings and dedicated protocols for pediatric acquisitions in fluoro and cine/DSA imaging, like \"virtual collimation\" functionality, an option to archive fluoro runs in DICOM format and more. Active radiation protection is based on the passive protection tools and requires adapting our behavior to the \"hostile\" environment in the fluoroscopy room. It obligates comprehensive knowledge and routine implementation of the basic protection rules and seeking for the measures to reduce the patient and personnel exposure. Active protection tools for the personnel include protective drapes suspended from the table and from the ceiling. Table- suspended drapes hang from the side of the patient table, between the undertable X-ray tube and the operator. They should always be employed, as they have been shown to substantially reduce operator dose. Pediatric patients like small children generate less scatter than adolescents or adults and consequently less exposure to the staff. Active patient protection tools get pathology.",

To compare CT fluoroscopy exposure to 3D cone beam CT exposure CT contributes about 50% in industrial countries of the medical radiation exposure. CT enables today a very fast 3D online imaging. The estimation of radiation risk in medicine has to be combined with the benefit for the patient. In the case of interventional procedures (IR) a risk-benefit calculation can be more easily done, but a critical medical indication has to be considered. Dose estimations are based on the fundamental two dose units for CT -the computed dose index (CTDI vol , measured in a PMMA phantom) and the dose length product. Both units are representative for an exposure of the PMMA phantom (diameter 32 cm, body, or 16 cm, head) . Using conversion factors you can estimate local or effective dose, but the values need further corrections. The radiation risk for patients undergoing complex IR procedures is mostly twice. The risk to be damaged by deterministic effects and to get high statistical risk of receiving radiation-induced tumors. For CT interventions the normal state is that the dose length product is not extraordinary high due to the fact of short scan length. The stochastic effects are mostly not the problem. But the repetition of scans at the same body section can cause high local doses in some cases up to the range of some Gy. In the next future it will be mandatory that CT scanner will indicate the accumulated dose during one examination/procedure. In this way the radiographer or the radiologist will be primed to exceed tolerance doses. The high dose rate of a CT can be especially a problem for the fingers of the radiologist during CT fluoroscopy. Depending on the type of scanner and the scan parameters the dose rate in the x-ray field of a CT can be in the range of 1 to 15 mSv per minute! If a radiologist has the fingers in the scan area, erythema is possible within some minutes. The annual dose limits of 500 mSv exceeded within 1 to 2 minutes CT fluoroscopy. This has to be considered in respect of some dozen examinations per year. Modern CT has possibilities to blank out the radiation. If the fingers are nearby the x-ray field the direct radiation and also the scattered radiation can be reduced very effectively. Radiation protection education, experience to use spacers and the optimal position of the fingers, the dose awareness and the individual dosimetry are basic skills for optimization radiation exposure of the radiologist. The necessity, if a radiologist has to stay in the examination room or if not is in many cases differentially considered. Ring-dosimeters should be used if CT fluoroscopy is a common procedure in the radiological department in the same way like in angiographic examination rooms. The big difference between CT and digital volume tomography (DVT) cone beam CT is the examination or scan time. CT x-ray tubes are rotating in less than 1 second, whereas DVT needs about 10 seconds. So the dose rate is a factor 10 to 100 lower for DVT at the skin of the patient. The dose for the patient undergoing a DVT examination can be similar or a little bit higher to CT referred to image quality. But the possibility to get 3D information, e.g. internal bleedings, 1. To explain the basic pathophysiology and incidence of infantile renovascular disease 2. To describe the technique and materials used for renal intervention in children 3. To overview clinical results Anatomical considerations in paediatric renovascular hypertension Although arterial disease is a relatively unusual cause of raised blood pressure in children, it is important to recognize because the alternative is life-long antihypertensive medication and the gradual accumulation of complications of either or both of the hypertension and its treatment. The distribution of disease is different to adults, with much more involvement of segmental or accessory arteries. It is currently impossible to exclude these lesions with non-invasive imaging, and therefore diagnostic angiography (with selective renal artery injections) remains an important part of the work-up of children with hypertension. In addition, a significant number of patients have midaortic syndrome (MAS) and/or cerebrovascular disease. Pathogenesis Atherosclerosis in children is essentially non-existent, but many known arterial diseases may cause hypertension, including neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Takayasu's arteritis, Williams' syndrome and post-surgical stenosis (especially in renal allografts) (1) . In most patients, however, no specific histological diagnosis is made. These children are usually said to have fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), although the anatomical distribution and other features are often quite different to those of FMD in adults.",

Most will require general anaesthesia for angioplasty. They have a longer life expectancy, and so have a longer time in which to develop radiation-induced malignancy. Crucially, the aims of treatment may be different from that in elderly patients with a short life expectancy. The inevitability of patient growth means that surgical options may not be as durable as in adults, and that angioplasty with the intent of delaying surgery (rather than cure) is sometimes a good idea. Indications for renal angioplasty in children All of these considerations mean that the indications and techniques for renal angioplasty are somewhat different to those in adults. Paediatric renal angioplasty is best performed in hospitals where there is considerable experience in managing children with complex medical conditions. A wide range of angioplasty balloons and stents should be available, including covered stents. An experienced surgeon should be on stand-by in case emergency surgery is required. Technique for renal angioplasty Nearly all procedures can be performed from a femoral approach. Careful angiography is essential, to show the abdominal aorta and its other branches, including selective angiography of all renal arteries in at least two projections. There are three main technical options for angioplasty. A single long 4-French sheath is appropriate in some cases, especially in small children, where adequate post-angioplasty aortography can often be performed through the sheath or a small catheter introduced through the sheath alongside the guidewire (2, 3) . Where this is not possible a pigtail catheter can be advanced to the abdominal aorta after a contralateral femoral puncture (the \"2-sheath\" technique). In larger children, a 6-French sheath and guiding catheter (2) or a long Munich 2011",

We do not recommend stenting for recoil following angioplasty, unless there is a flow-limiting dissection, because the relationship between angiographic appearances and clinical response is unpredictable in children.

To analyse the results of trials on TACE with respect to other therapies Chemoembolisation is the standard of care in the treatment paradigm of the majority of patients presenting with hepatocellular carcinoma. Meta analysis of the early studies of chemoembolisation, even from a literature limited by a variance in technique and patient selection, has confirmed a survival benefit. However, the last five to ten years have allowed hepatologists, surgeons and interventional radiologists to understand more clearly its importance in differing and defined classes of patients. Its value is established as a bridge in the treatment pathway of potential transplant candidates and those listed for transplantation in an era of limited organ availability. Furthermore, there is increasing recognition of how it may potentially downstage tumours to allow curative liver resection and may be used in conjunction with ablation techniques and biological agents with curative intent. It is one of the interventional oncological treatments where patient selection is perhaps more important than the technique. The vast majority of these tumours arise in the presence of cirrhosis where the histological cascade that results in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and field change disease is well described. The imaging characteristics of transformation to hepatocellular demonstrated on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of enhanced arterialisation with portal venous washout can be exploited by any embolisation technique. The aims of chemoembolisation are to achieve complete tumour necrosis by embolisation but at the same time to deliver a high concentration of a chemotherapeutic agent to the tumour. Embolisation results in reduced intratumoural flow obstructing arterial and portal venous flow through the peribiliary plexus, creating ischaemia and increasing contact time between the chemotherapeutic agent and the tumour cells. Tumour cell ischaemia causes changes in the cell membrane resulting in increased retention of the chemotherapeutic agent. However, at the same time the technique should ensure accurate targeting of the tumour so as to reduce the risk of global ischaemia to the cirrhotic liver and hepatic decompensation that may occur. The introduction of drub eluting beads as a development in the 349 C RSE CIRSE Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course technique is now being supported by an evidence base for their use in selected patients. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that beads deliver a sustained slow release of doxorubicin for a period of up to 14 days post-delivery, and result in an increased level of doxorubicin and cell necrosis with lower systemic levels of doxorubicin depending on the bead size. Lower systemic levels reduce the chemotherapy-induced morbidity of this technique. The most important contraindications revolve around measures of synthetic function with rising Childs Pugh, MELD or BCLC being the key determinants of appropriate patient selection. As a general principle the subset of patients that will not benefit from chemoembolisation is established. In broad categories these are Childs C patients with small tumours of less than 4 cm where the standard of care is liver transplantation. Chemoembolisation carries a high risk of decompensation and although neo-adjuvant therapy has the potential to keep an individual patient within transplant criteria, tumour progression outside criteria may also be a measure of unfavourable biology. The other groups are those patients with extrahepatic disease. However, combination therapies with chemoembolisation and biological agents particularly sorafenib are now under trial evaluation. A final group of patients are those with significant cardiac or renal comorbidities which may adversely impact on survival. This presentation will review the current status of this technique placing a particular emphasis on the combined clinical and radiological decisions that dictate the therapeutic pathway.",

To analyse the indications and the role of radioembolization with respect to other therapies 3. To report the results from the available literature and from personal experience Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) claims half a million lives across the globe each year. It is the sixth most common cancer in the world and is the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality. The incidence of HCC varies considerably across geographic regions with some areas reporting cases as high as 20/100,000 per annum. In patients diagnosed with this lethal malignancy, less than 15% are candidates for surgical procedures. A survival benefit has been observed in patients that meet the rigorous criteria for curative resection or transplantation. For the remaining majority, various treatment options have become available without universal agreement on which treatment option offers the greatest survival benefit with the least toxicity. The use of external beam irradiation has historically played a limited role in the treatment of HCC due to the radiosensitive nature of normal hepatic tissue. Investigators have shown that liver exposure to radiation doses greater than 40 Gy may result in a clinical syndrome characterized by ascites, anicteric hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes weeks to months following therapy, called Radiation Induced Liver Disease (RILD). Given this limitation and the need for higher doses to inflict lethal injury to malignant tissue, minimally invasive intra-arterial devices have emerged. These devices, loaded with radioactive Yttrium-90 microspheres, can deliver very high tumoricidal doses without the development of RILD. Yttrium-90 intra-arterial radiotherapy, also known as radioembolization, is a minimally invasive catheter-based therapy that delivers internal radiation via the arterial vessels that feed tumors. \"Radio\" refers to the radiation that is imparted to tissue; \"embolization\" refers to the microembolic effect. This technology takes advantage of the dual blood supply to the liver. Normal hepatic tissue derives greater than 70% of its blood supply by way of the portal system whereas malignant tissue is preferentially supplied by the arterial system. There are currently two commercially available Yttrium-90 microsphere devices. TheraSphere \u00ae (MDS Nordion, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) is made of glass and SIR-Spheres \u00ae (Sirtex Medical, Sydney, Australia) is made of resin. These two devices are different in a number of important respects. TheraSphere \u00ae is a device consisting of 20-30 micron particles with higher specific activity (2500 Bq) and lower number of spheres (1.2 million microspheres/3 GBq). Conversely, SIR-Spheres \u00ae are consisting of 20-60 micron particles, with lower specific activity (50 Bq), and greater number of spheres (approximately 40-80 million spheres/3 GBq). Clinical investigations into the use of radioembolization for the palliative treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma appear promising. This therapy potentially offers survival benefit with a low toxicity profile, making it an attractive tool in the battle against a uniformly fatal disease. In addition, investigators have shown favorable survival outcomes in patients with limited hepatic reserve and portal vein thrombosis. These patients were previously excluded from most therapeutic options. Furthermore, this therapy has successfully been used to bridge and downstage patients to resection, ablation or transplantation. Although phase II paradigms have provided useful data, there is a need to carry out randomized controlled trials comparing radioembolization to those accepted as standard of care for this patient population. These studies will then establish the role of radioembolization within the framework of other universally accepted first line therapies for inoperable disease. Finally, the development of targeted therapies at the molecular level represents the beginning of a new era in the treatment of HCC. Clinical investigations into combining the cytotoxic effect of radioembolization with the cytostatic mechanism of targeted therapies are currently in progress and will provide valuable safety and toxicity data that may translate into improved clinical outcome and overall survival.

It arises from the medial segment of the subclavian giving branches to the anterior costophrenic sulcus and diaphragm and gives anterior intercostal branches (pericardiophrenic, anterior mediastinal, pericardial, and sternal) . At the level of the manubrium it gives the musculophrenic and superior epigastric. The musculophrenic goes through the diaphragm and gives lower anterior intercostal branches (7th to 9th) and anastomoses with the inferior phrenic. The superior epigastric artery forms diaphragmatic branches that extend into the falciform ligament of the liver and anastomose with the hepatic artery. On the left side HCCs located in S8 or S4 are fed by the right IMA whereas HCC located in the left lateral segment are fed by the left IMA mainly through the pericardiophrenic or the musculophrenic branch. Adrenal HCC in the inferior surface of the liver can be supplied by adrenal arteries. The superior adrenal originates from the inferior phrenic, the middle directly from the aorta and the inferior adrenal from the renal artery. The normal adrenal gland blushing is triangular shaped and should be differentiated from tumor hypervascularity. Renal and capsular HCC in the inferior surface of the liver can be supplied by renal and renal capsular arteries. The superior capsular artery usually arises together with the inferior adrenal artery from the renal artery or may originate from arcuate and interlobular arteries.",

            "text": "The majority of HCC is highly hypervascular. However, there is a 10-18% of embolization naive HCC that presents diminished vascularity while a significant proportion of HCC will present reduced intratumoral vascularity after several courses of chemoembolization. Hypovascularity has been identified as an independent parameter of poor response. It clearly presents a difficulty for localization of the lesion and selective catheterization to better target the administration of the chemoembolization material (conventional chemoembolization or drug eluting beads), and in addition the diminished vascularity is an inadequate \"road\" to curry the material into the intratumoral vessels. For the localization acquiring cross-sectional and 3Dimages during endovascular or procedures with high spatial and contrast resolution is now feasible with flat panel technology. The resulting angiographic CT (ACT) produces CT-like images are suitable to check if the area supplied by the vessel that is catheterized corresponds to the intended embolization territory. Intraprocedural sonography (unenhanced and CEUS) performed before and during the procedure is a very good alternative if flat panel technology is not available. As Moschouris et al have shown the initial unenhanced US scan is performed after the placement of the catheter (or microcatheter) in the segmental or subsegmental tumor feeder. One or two scans can be performed in between the initial injections of the embolic suspension. In questionable cases a diluted contrast for ultrasound or bubble injection may easily assist in confirmation of the right vessel selection. For radiation protection, intraprocedural US is not performed during injection of the embolic agent. Newly appearing, high-level echoes, with or without acoustic shadow, are considered a sonographic change induced by (chemo) embolization (this method was performed with chemoembolization with DC Bead). This \"echogenic alteration\" (EA) confirms the right distribution of the embolic material. Increased EA score is associated with extended tumor necrosis. However, because the echoes that constitute EA are often ill defined and accompanied by multiple 351 C RSE CIRSE Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course artifacts, EA cannot accurately estimate the degree of the necrosis. A reliable differentiation between complete and almost complete necrosis cannot be based on EA. In contrast, a weak or moderate EA score does not preclude a good embolization result, as shown by the discordance between intraprocedural US and intraprocedural CEUS in five of the studied tumors. Intralesional hypoechogenicity is another \"immediate\" change detected on unenhanced intraprocedural US. Intraprocedural CEUS is a feasible and safe method for rapid, on-site assessment of the right territory choice and the effect of TACE. The additional value of intraprocedural CEUS to selective angiography reflects the higher sensitivity of the latter in depicting tumor (micro) vascularity. CEUS is useful during treatment of small and/or hypovascular tumors, selection of the appropriate tumor feeder. In such cases, the emergence of a strong echogenic response within the tumor could serve as a sign of successful embolization.",

            "text": "1. To describe synergies in interventional approaches in HCC 2. To analyse the results of trials using combination strategies 3. To understand the role of combined therapies in the management of HCC Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Despite the widespread implementation of surveillance programs, more than half of the patients with HCC are diagnosed late, when curative treatments cannot be applied. In addition, in a high proportion of cases the disease recurs after a radical therapy. For patients presenting with multinodular HCC and relatively preserved liver function, absence of cancer-related symptoms, and no evidence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread -i.e., those classified as intermediate-stage according to the BCLC staging system -transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the current standard of care. The recommendation for TACE as the standard-of-care for intermediate-stage HCC is based on the demonstration of improved survival compared with best supportive care or suboptimal therapies in a meta-analysis of six randomized control trials. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the individual study designs (including inpatient populations and TACE technique) as well as the study results, with only two of the six individual studies that reported 2-year survival showing a statistically significant improvement compared with conservative management. In fact, intermediate-stage HCC includes a heterogeneous population of patients, as suggested by a classification that can include patients varying widely in terms of tumour burden and liver function (Child-Pugh A or B). It has been therefore suggested that -while TACE improves survival for the intermediate-stage HCC class as a whole -not all patients with intermediate-stage HCC will derive similar benefit from TACE, and that some intermediate-stage patients may benefit from treatments other than or in combination with TACE. Investigation of the combination of targeted agents with TACE with antiangiogenetic properties is important, because there is a rationale for potential synergy between these therapies. Systemic therapy with a multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, is presently considered the therapy of choice for patients with advanced HCC. In two RCTs, this multi-kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties has been shown to prolong median overall survival and median time to radiological progression compared to placebo. In a study of tumor specimens from patients with HCC treated with TACE, the production of the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor was higher than in samples from patients treated with surgery alone. Furthermore, in an experimental tumor model, hypoxia, caused by embolization of liver tumors, activated hypoxiainducible factor 1-alpha, a transcription factor that, in turn, regulates other proangiogenic factors. Given the known antiangiogenic properties of sorafenib and the better tolerability of drug-eluting beads TACE (DEB-TACE), the combination of TACE with sorafenib holds promise and clinical trials investigating this therapeutic approach are ongoing (Sorafenib or Placebo in Combination with Transarterial Chemoembolization for Intermediate-stage HCC [SPACE] trial; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00855218). Preliminary data analysis of a Phase II trial of sorafenib combined with DEB-TACE shows promising results in term of safety and efficacy (95% disease control rate according to EASL criteria). Selected categories of patients classified as advanced stage HCC according to BCLC present with a limited disease. These include patients who have a branch vein tumoral invasion or those who have a limited extrahepatic disease. It is debatable if patients bearing vascular invasion limited to a venous branch, should be denied to intraarterial treatments that are technically feasible and could represent a valuable option. This represents another important field of investigation and two phase III RCTs studies of sorafenib or placebo in combination with TACE, including patients with limited portal vein thrombosis, are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.govidentifier, NCT01004978; EudraCT: 2008-005073-36 ",

To project the chances of IR and how to make it irreplaceable Interventional radiological procedures have become a standard in most European countries. Both vascular and nonvascular procedures are inevitable for standard-of-care diagnostic work-up and treatment. They replaced many open surgical procedures such as aortobifemoral bypass in most iliac artery obstructions, challenge established procedures such as hysterectomy for myomas and undermine current concepts of care such as interventional oncology. As the future for interventional radiology looks bright, it does not so for interventional radiologists. Because the procedures become more and more in use, other specialities are trying -partly very successsfully -to get their share of the cake. The timing and the field of expertise differ from one country to another but is found in more or less all member countries. While in Germany, for example, interventional uroradiology started in radiology, it now more or less disappeared into urology at least for nonvascular procedures. Biliary interventions have been frequently overtaken by gastroenterologists and biopsies are performed by merely everyone at least by ultrasound. Neurointerventions are -in some countries -predominantly performed by neurosurgeons, vascular interventions are partly in the hands of vascular surgeons in others such as Belgium, France and Italy. Vascular interventional radiology is probably the largest field in many institutions and deals not only with recanalization of obstructions but also with embolization techniques which are especially required in emergency situations. Interventional treatment of stroke becomes more and more in larger hospitals but needs to be available 24 hours at 7 days. Proper training requires a minimum of procedures to train doctors in an adequate fashion and numbers; and recanalization procedures and diagnostic angioghraphic procedures are predominantly these procedures which give even trainees the chance to get in touch with standard tricks and techniques in a relatively safe environment. As now, many different specialities try to be involved into the field of vascular interventions, there is a risk of atomization of knowledge and experience putting a hospital in the risky situation that nobody is experienced enough to cover all situations adequately. Moreover, there is the chance of a significant cost rise as many different specialities needed to be available day and night to cover their interventional segment. Safeguards to prevent wild and uncontrolled experimental interventional radiology by non-radiologists mainly deal with radiation safety regulations but are very different from one country to another. Also, standards for qualification are rarely regulated. As money and influence give always a strong motivation for doctors to take over new inventions and techniques, lack of proper training is not a reason for them to stay away. Interventional radiologists need to make sure that they are the best trained people in the field, have outstanding clinical and technical standards and offer their services in an independent decision making surrounding that allows the patient to trust on an unbalanced recommendation. Thus, establishment of cooperative vascular units and also business models are mandatory for interventional radiologists to survive. Diagnostic radiologists should become aware of the fact, that without interventional radiology, their survival as a clinical hospital-based entity will be questionable in the future and teleradiological take-overs become more likely. 1.3 .

To project the political meaning of separating IR from general radiology 3. To critically analyse the financial and structural autonomy of IR as a subspecialty Interventional Radiology discipline has taken great strides in the last four decades and has replaced much of traditional surgery. However, it faces many challenges and frustrations, including erosion by other specialties. Happily, there are still areas of substantial growth in our practice, including tumour ablation, vertebroplasty and embolization procedures. These are fields of activity in which competition is either weak or non-existent. However, there are also areas from which interventional radiologists are largely excluded, which involve procedures that we can perform perfectly well, but are prevented from doing so by others, who may be less skilled, but have access to the relevant patients. Examples of such areas are the fields of tracheobronchial and gastrointestinal intervention, which, in most hospitals, are carried out by chest physicians and gastroenterologists. This is frustrating because, although endoscopy is useful in making the initial diagnosis, it is unnecessary in the performance of the therapeutic procedure, and simply increases the cost. Four factors determine who does what in practical disciplines: in ascending importance these are research activity, skills and training, the numbers of practitioners and, most important of all, clinical control of patients. Research is difficult to measure accurately but there are indications that the research activity of radiologists, in general, and interventional radiologists, in particular, is less than that of many clinical disciplines. Skills and training are our strength; interventional radiologists are well trained and 355 (3.6 vs 5.0 hours), hospital stay (3 vs 7 days) , and intensive care unit stay (1 vs 4 days) . There were no differences between the 2 groups in major morbidity, procedure failure, secondary therapeutic procedures, aneurysm-related hospitalizations, health-related quality of life, or erectile function. There was no significant difference in mortality at 2 years (7.0% vs 9.8%, P=.13). The aneurysm-related mortality rate was 1.4% in the EVAR group and 3.0 % in the OSR group. Post-repair aneurysm-related interventions were observed in 108 EVAR patients and 86 OSR patients. The 61 secondary therapeutic procedures in the EVAR group included 42 endovascular procedures, 3 explantations of the graft with conversion to open repair, 9 other arterial procedures with an open component, 5 groin wound procedures, and 2 amputations (both legs of 1 patient). The 55 secondary therapeutic procedures in the OSR group included 24 incisional hernia repairs, 7 aortic graft procedures, 4 procedures for wound complications, 4 amputations (1 toe, 1 leg, and below and above knee on same leg), 4 laparotomies for bowel obstruction, 2 laparotomies for hematoma, 2 procedures to relieve claudication, and 8 miscellaneous minor procedures. Incisional hernia was reported in 30 patients who had open repair, resulting in secondary therapeutic procedures in 21 patients (4.9%), all of whom had undergone an anterior surgical approach in the original open repair (5) . In the EVAR group, there were 134 endoleaks in 110 patients (25%), resulting in 21 secondary therapeutic procedures in 18 patients (4.1%) (5) . In the EVAR II trial 404 patients that were considered to be physically ineligible for OSR with large abdominal aortic aneurysms (\u22655.5 cm in diameter) were randomly assigned to undergo either EVAR or no repair (6) . The mean age was 76.8 years and the mean aneurysm diameter was 6.7cm. Patients were followed for rates of death, graft-related complications and reinterventions, and costs. The 30-day operative mortality was 7.3% in the EVAR group. Of the 207 patients who were assigned for non-intervention 70 (34%) had later an aneurysm repair after a mean follow-up of 244 days. The overall rate of aneurysm rupture in the no-intervention group was 12.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6 to 16.2) per 100 person-years. The overall aneurysm-related mortality was 3.6 deaths per 100 personyears in the endovascular-repair group and 7.3 deaths per 100 person-years in the non-intervention group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.89; P = 0.02) (7) . This advantage did not result in any benefit in terms of total mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.27; P = 0.97). A total of 48% of patients who survived EVAR had graft-related complications, and 27% required reintervention (mostly endoleaks) within the first 6 years. During 8 years of follow-up, EVAR was considerably more expensive than no repair (cost difference, \u00a39,826 [U.S. $14,867] ; 95% CI, 7, 638 to 12, 013 [11, 556 to 18, 176 ]) (7) . In summary, all 3 randomized trials which compared EVAR and OSR demonstrated a significantly lower 30-day or in hospital mortality rate after EVAR. However, this survival benefit was lost after 2-6 years of follow-up. The aneurysm-related mortality rate during the follow-up for up to 6 years was low 1.4%-5.7% for EVAR and 3.0%-6.3% for OSR. Reinterventions were observed in the EVAR group primarily because of endoleaks and graft migration. The most common cause of reintervention in the OSR group was incisional hernia. In the EVAR 2 trial in which patients not fit for OSR were randomized to EVAR versus observation placement of an endovascular graft led to a significant reduction in aneurysm-related mortality, primarily through prevention of late aneurysm rupture.

            "text": "In the era of decision making the diameter of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is considered the most important variable predicting rupture. The UK Small Aneurysm (UK) Trial and the VA's Aneurysm Detection and Management (ADAM) Trial have demonstrated that there is no benefit from early surgery versus regular ultrasound or CT scan surveillance for AAAs that are < 5.5 cm 1, 2, 3 . These trials demonstrated a 30-day operative mortality for elective open repair ranging from 2.7% in the USA up to 5.5% in the UK and both indicated that the rupture rate of small AAA was very low, less than 1% per annum. The findings of these two trials were summarized in a recent Cochrane review (at 6 years HR ), showing the safety and hence benefits of a policy of surveillance for aneurysms 4.0-5.5 cm in diameter 4 . The evolution in the endovascular area has influenced the management of AAA. A reasonable controversy arising is that much of our present decision making is based on studies comparing open repair to surveillance. The efficacy of endovascular repair (EVAR) compared with open surgical repair (OR) has been tested in four randomized trials, the EVAR I, the DREAM, the OVER and the ACE trial 5, 6, 7, 8 . Three of these trials had similar results and showed an initial survival advantage in the endovascular technique (30-d mortality rates after EVAR compared with OR EVAR I: 4.7% vs. 1.7%, DREAM: 4.6% vs. 1.2%, and OVER: 3% vs. 0.5%) 5, 6, 7 . The 8-and 6-year follow-up results of the EVAR I and DREAM trials demonstrated similar survival rates between patients treated with OR and EVAR, but patients with EVAR in long-term follow-up were associated with increased rates of graft-related complications and reinterventions 5, 6 . The Anevrysme de l'aorte abdominale: Chirurgie versus Endoprothese (ACE) trial was recently published after several years of delay, due to financial difficulties related to stent graft approval for the EVAR procedure. Interestingly, the trial showed that there was no difference in-hospital mortality (0.6% vs 1.3%; P = 1.0) and survival between the two groups. The authors concluded that in patient with low to intermediate risk factors, open repair of AAA is as safe as EVAR and remains a more durable option. The early lower mortality rate observed after EVAR has also reopened the threshold of AAA diameter for recommending surgical repair. EUROSTAR data cited evidence that patients with smaller aneurysms following EVAR may be associated with a reduced longterm mortality and graft complication rates 9 . Two randomized trials, the CAESAR trial and the PIVOTAL trial, have investigated whether EVAR might be justified in patients with small aneurysms 10, 11 . A difference between these two studies was that the PIVOTAL trial, focused only on the 4.0-5.0 cm diameter range (CAESAR: 4.0-5.5 cm diameter range). The two trials had clearly defined intervention policies for the surveillance groups in addition to reaching the threshold diameter. Both studies in a follow-up of three years concluded that there is no benefit to early endovascular repair of small abdominal aortic aneurysms in comparison to surveillance 10, 11 .",

An issue for debate is whether surgical intervention is justified in case of females with small AAAs or in subsets of younger lowrisk patients, with long life-expectancy. In the UK trial, the estimated adjusted hazard ratios were in the direction of greater benefit of early surgery for younger patient, but this benefit did not reach a statistical significance 2 .

The overall mortality rate of patients is still extremely high ranging from 70 to 90% 15 The majority of observational studies have revealed improved outcomes after emergent EVAR for ruptured AAA than those traditionally reported in the literature for open repair. However, these values should be balanced through the understanding that in these studies there were publication bias and significant patient selectivity according to hemodynamic instability, suitability for EVAR and surgeon's preference. Another factor for these favorable results might be the differences in operative technique and experience. Also, the open surgery group for rAAA is likely to contain more complex cases, such as those with pararenal diseases and more unstable patients, unfit for imaging delay.",

EVAR should be considered as a treatment option for ruptured AAA, provided that anatomy is suitable, the centre is appropriately equipped and the team experienced in emergency endovascular aneurysm procedures (Level 2b, Recommendation B) 13 . There is evidence for the need of a multidisciplinary approach and a standardized protocol to treat effectively the critical condition (Level 2C, Recommendation A) 13 . The United Kingdom National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), in its consensus document published in February 2009, stated that EVAR was not recommended for rAAA, except in the context of research 22 . Further, more robust evidence is required to convince this independent national guidance organization. Conclusions According to the available data, surveillance remains the preferred policy for small aneurysms 4.0-5.5 cm in diameter. Young, fit patients, and especially women, with AAA between 5.0 cm and 5.4 cm in maximum diameter may benefit from repair. The decision making depends on the balance of risks and benefits and medical advice for the treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm should be individualized. The role of EVAR in the management of rAAAs is still obscure. High standards of organization are needed from specialized centers to manage the urgent nature of rAAAs. EVAR in emergency settings requires a dedicated and readily available multidisciplinary staff with trained experience as well as dedicated specific technology. Results from the ongoing randomized trials will probably elucidate the role of EVAR in ruptured aneurysms. The best way to keep the situation under surveillance, in terms of imaging modality and follow-up time, has been discussed for long and is still being discussed. After stent-graft implantation contrast-enhanced CT is generally considered the gold standard in patients' follow-up because it has shown high sensitivity to endoleak detection, the most frequent complication of EVAR, with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 90%. In addition, CTA allows a clear picture of graft integrity and morphologic evaluation of the aneurysm. The European Collaborators on Stent/graft Techniques for Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) Registry recommends a follow-up consisting of CTA examinations performed at 1, 6, and 12 months after the procedure and subsequent annual investigations, unless complications develop. However, the lifelong requirement for patient surveillance accentuates certain drawbacks of CT angiography, including ionizing radiation burden and nephrotoxic contrast agent load. As recently reported, and also suggested by the American College of Radiology, the dose of unnecessary radiation needs to be reduced in diagnostic imaging. Following these issues and using safer and more reliable new generation stent-grafts can surely optimize the follow-up protocol after EVAR.",

Sonographic contrast agents enhance the capability of color duplex imaging to detect endoleaks.

The mean effective dose of CT angiography for EVAR follow-up is approximately 15 mSv. The stochastic risk of a fatal radiation-induced tumor is estimated to be 5%/ Sv radiation. Therefore, the risk of cancer induction of one CT angiography procedure is approximately 1 in 1,500, indicating the relevance of reliable alternatives to annual CT angiography for post-EVAR follow-up particularly in younger patients.

Learning Objectives: 1. To describe techniques and devices used in ablation of colorectal hepatic metastases 2. To discuss indications and results of ablation in hepatic metastases 3. To understand the role of ablation with respect to surgical and medical treatments in colorectal liver metastases The liver is a common site for primary malignancy and hematogenous metastasis. Although surgical resection of metastatic hepatic tumors is generally regarded as first-line therapy, the majority of patients with hepatic malignancy have disease that is not amenable to surgical resection because of tumor location, poor hepatic reserve, or medical comorbidities. This has led to significant interest in the development of nonsurgical image-guided therapies, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Percutaneous thermal ablation is an emerging treatment option for many tumors in patients which are no candidates for conventional treatments -mostly surgical resection. During a thermal ablation procedure, an electrode, antenna or an applicator with a small diameter is put into the target tumor under imaging guidance. Most often CT fluoroscopic guidance is used; however, ultrasound and even MRI guidance is applied by different groups. Beside radiofrequency, there are various energy sources which can heat biological tissues. Microwaves, laser light and ultrasonic waves are the most common other techniques used for tumor destruction. During RF ablation, alternating electrical current of a high frequency (~500 kHz) produces ionic agitation and therefore frictional heating around the interstitial electrode. In monopolar systems skin surface electrodes (ground pads) has to be used to complete the electrical circuit, while in bipolar systems both poles are on the same needle. Depending on the time, the current is applied, tissue temperatures can rise to cytotoxic levels (above 60 \u00b0C) and can create ablation volumes of up to 5 cm in each direction. RF ablation is used for nearly 20 years, with good results for local tumor control, extended survival and low complication rates. However, there are some drawbacks in RF. The ablation volume is hampered by local blood flow (so called heat sink effect) and high electrical impedance tissues. The advent of microwave ablation can alleviate some of these problems by producing faster, volumetric heating. In microwave ablation the heat is caused by a fast rotation of water molecules and is therefore less influenceable by large vessels. To create larger or conformal ablations, multiple microwave antennas can be used simultaneously while most RF systems available on the market require sequential placement, which limits their efficiency.

Percutaneous cryoablation has been shown to be effective against RCC and many metastatic tumors, particularly colorectal cancer, in the liver. Thermal tumor ablation can be performed at open surgery, laparoscopy or using a percutaneous approach. When performed percutaneously, the ablation procedure relies on imaging for diagnosis, planning, applicator guidance, treatment monitoring and follow-up. Ultrasound is the most popular modality for guidance and treatment monitoring worldwide, but computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used as well.

To analyze the indications and the role of radioembolization with respect to other therapies 3. To report the results from the available literature and personal experience Radioembolisation of colorectal liver metastases involves the endovascular delivery of microspheres labeled with Yttrium 90 into the hepatic arterial circulation (usually via a radiologically inserted arterial catheter). Loco-regional therapies are attractive in the treatment of colorectal liver disease. It is unclear why liver is often the only site of metastatic disease. Any treatment that relies totally on imaging for targeting can only be considered a local treatment. Surgery, external beam radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation are local treatments applicable only to visible disease. The proportion of micrometastases increases disproportionately (? exponentially) with increase in number of visible metastases. Even in the best surgical cases (<3-4 metastases) patients are likely to relapse and usually in the liver. Even with the addition of chemotherapy, in the best operable cases, 50% of patients relapse by 18mths and usually in the liver (1) . Thus, combination treatments are attractive particularly if they combine systemic treatments with loco-regional therapies (hepatic arterial chemotherapy, drug-eluting beads, and radioembolisation). External beam radiation therapy has an established role in the treatment of primary rectal carcinoma where it has a synergistic effect with chemotherapy. Normal liver tissue, however, is very sensitive to radiation. Radiation-induced liver disease occurs 3 weeks to 3 months post-irradiation and presents with detoriation in hepatic function and ascites. Thus, targeted delivery of radiation therapy is mandatory, external beam or the endovascular injection of radiolabelled particles. Tumour angiogenesis results in increased blood flow to liver tumours. Tumours greater than 2cm in diameter obtain 80% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery. Intra-arterial injection of radiolabelled microspheres means that they are preferentially deposited in the tumour microvasculature. Yttrium emits \u03b2 radiation with limited penetration. Thus, high radiation doses to liver tumours of the order of 200Gy are achieved whilst limiting the dose to surrounding normal liver (order of 20Gy) (2) . Suitable patients have unresectable liver disease, no or stable/limited extra-hepatic disease and normal liver, renal and haematological function. Preparation prior to treatment involves cross-sectional imaging, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies and visceral angiography to assess and prepare the hepatic arterial circulation. The arterial circulation may require manipulation to allow safe delivery of the radiolabelled material. Awareness of the arterial anatomy variations is prerequisite (3, 4) . Radiolabelled macro aggregated albumin is injected at this time to allow a nuclear medicine scan to be performed to measure the liver to lung shunt. A shunt over 20% precludes treatment. Injection of the therapeutic material usually takes place a week later. The dose delivered depends on the shunt study and the degree of liver involvement. Following the therapeutic injection a further Nuclear Medicine scan is performed to assess the Bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by the inter-reaction between the \u03b2 radiation and the liver tissue to obtain an indication of the anatomical distribution of the injected material. Potential complications include hepatic failure/portal hypertension, pancreatitis, pneumonitis, gastro-intestinal ulceration or bleeding, cholecystitis, infection/abscess. Radiation dermatitis in a peri-umbilical distribution is possible if microspheres get deposited in this anatomical area via a patent falciform artery. High risk patients are those with limited hepatic reserve, high or low tumour load, previous liver resection, previous biliary intervention or endovascular therapy. Increased toxicity is potentially possible with co-existent treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents (Capecitibine. Gemcitibine). Assessment of response is with cross-sectional imaging and PET. Tumour response can be difficult to assess on cross-sectional imaging. PET appears to provide a more sensitive indication of response (5) . Best results appear to be obtained in conjunction with chemotherapy (6) . Response on PET imaging is also an indicator of survival (7) . Improved survival or disease control (time to progression or objective response rates) have been demonstrated in the first line setting (6, 8, 9) , after second or third line chemotherapy (10, 11) and in the salvage setting (7, 12, 13) . Even in advanced disease it can be possible to downstage patients so that they become resectable (9, 12) . Further, larger randomised studies are in progress. The FOXFIRE study is a randomised phase 2 design of radioembolisation in conjunction with chemotherapy (Oxaloplatin) against chemotherapy alone. 2. Stubbs R et al. HPB 2004; 3: 133-139. 3.

To understand the role of combined therapies in the management of colorectal liver metastases Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common causes of cancer death in the Western world. In the case of colorectal cancer metastatic disease, the liver is the only metastatic site in 20%-30% of patients. Therefore, the liver involvement becomes a life-threatening factor. Surgical resection has long been considered the only treatment able to offer prolonged survival to patients with hepatic tumors. Unfortunately many patients are not candidates for surgery because of the extent and/or distribution of the malignancies or the underlying chronic liver disease. The role of image-guided locoregional therapies in the management of patients with liver cancer has vastly spread in the last decade. Such therapies, which rely on imaging guidance for tumor targeting, include various percutaneous and catheter-based ablative techniques. Radio-frequency thermal ablation (RFA) produces a coagulative necrosis via an alternating high-frequency electric current, which is delivered through an electrode placed in the centre of a lesion. However, RFA is inherently limited by the volume of tumor that can be effectively ablated. In small lesions (<3 cm), complete necrosis can be achieved in more than 80% of patients, but local failure rates increase rapidly as the tumor diameter exceeds 3 cm. For lesions with a diameter between 3 and 5 cm, the percentage of complete necrosis varies between 50 and 70%. The inability to reliably creating adequate volumes of coagulation necrosis reduces the technical indications for RFA in treating large hepatic tumors. The cooling effect coming from the liver blood flow (the so-called \"heat sink effect\") usually affects the radial heat distribution, reflecting the biophysiological limitations in achieving large volume of heat-induced coagulation necrosis. Liver neoplasms, both primary and metastases, are supplied almost entirely by the hepatic arteries, and the abundant arterial blood flow within and outside tumors, leading for the cooling effect, may reduce the effectiveness of RFA in treating large tumors. Several Authors have been able to increase RF-induced coagulation necrosis volume by occluding blood flow to the liver during ablation procedures in animal models. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) consists of the intrarterial administration of embolic microparticles in order to obtain the blood flow shut down. TAE may therefore reduce hepatic arterial blood flow, attenuating the heat sink effect during liver RFA. Recently, many clinical studies have shown that combination of RFA and TAE is effective on large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, current literature is mainly focused on HCC rather than on liver metastases. Our 5-year experience at European Institute of Oncology demonstrated that combination of TAE (performed with very-small spherical microparticles) and percutaneous RFA, both performed during the same session, is really feasible, well tolerated and effective even in treating patients affected by liver metastases technically or clinically unresectable.",

Among these lesions 17 were metastases from colorectal cancer (size ranged between 18 and 70mm-average 35mm) in 16 patients. All cases were previously discussed within a dedicated tumor board. Patients previously received chemotherapy, and in some cases multiple liver surgical resections and developed progressive liver only disease not eligible for further surgery. Preliminary routine physical examination, laboratory tests and image studies including unenhanced and contrast mediumenhanced three-phase Computed Tomography (MDCT) were performed before treatment in all patients. All interventions were performed under general anaesthesia. With right transfemoral artery access, superior mesenteric and hepatic arteriography was obtained, in order to assess all the arteries feeding to the tumor. After a stable selective catheterization of tumor feeders was obtained, small calibrated (100 m) microspheres (Embozene TM ; Color-Advanced Microspheres Celonova BioSciences) were injected until blood flow was arrested. Then percutaneous embolization was performed by mean of RFA multitined expandable electrode (Le Veen needle) sized according to tumor size and shape. Percutaneous electrodes were then connected to the generator (RF 3000, Boston Scientific) and RF energy was applied till roll-off was acheived. In two patients, after TAE, underwent RFA ablation under ultrasound (US ) guidance within the angio room; two patients underwent TAE in the angio-room, then were transferred in the operating room, where RFA was performed with laparoscopic approach under US guidance; seventeen patients were treated in a dedicated CT room, using simultaneously a CT scan (Hi-Speed; General Electric) coupled with a portable digital C-arm (Moon Ray; Simad) . In these cases TAE was performed by inserting the microcatheter into feeding arteries under fluoroscopy, then CT scans were acquired during intrarterial contrast media injection, in order to confirm the appropriateness of the catheter position for the right embolization. Again in these cases the RFA needle was inserted under US guidance, and its correct position was confirmed by CT. The day after the interventions, all patients underwent a MDCT scan, in order to assess preliminary results. Once discharged, patients were evaluated both clinically and with MDCT on regular basis at 30 days, three months, and every six months after treatment. The early treatment efficacy was defined by assessing the extension ablated area. Complications were classified according to the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Standards of Practice.",

Non-enhancing hypodense areas at MDCT, performed 24 hours after treatment, ranged from 37 to 104 mm in maximum axial diameter, measured at the corresponding MDCT slide of the pre-treated lesion maximum diameter. Safety margins, calculated as the difference between the maximum diameter after and before treatment divided by two, MDCT images, ranged from 2 to 30.5 mm (average 16 mm). Follow-up (MDCT) average is 19.6 mos. No patients have been lost at follow-up. Complete response (CR) intended as the complete devascularization at MDCT follow-up controls of the treated lesions has been obtained in all patients, in a maximum follow-up period of 12 months. Indeed, in a patient, with a single CRC liver metastasis, at one year follow-up MDCT, tumor relapse was observed. One patient died six months after treatment for an unusual neurologic, Alzheimer's like, disease induced by previous chemotherapy. In some series reporting the treatment of huge HCC, it has been well demonstrated how the association of TAE/TACE with RFA increased dramatically local results achieving larger ablated areas and reducing peripheral recurrence. The arterial blood flow shut down to the liver area, where the lesion is located, may probably reduce the \"heat sink effect\", allowing for a better heat diffusion in the liver parenchyma previously embolized. The synergistic effect of the two treatments may lead for a bigger treated volume of the embolized area with a shorter exposure time to RFA and a possible reduction of the applied energy, as already demonstrated in animal models. In our experience, we observed huge complete treated areas after the combined approach in all patients. MDCT non-enhanced hypodense areas were always biggest than the diameter of the employed electrodes. Our goal was to obtain a disease free margin around the treated lesion properly as recommended surgery resection. Indeed, conventional teaching advocates a margin of at least 10mm clear of microscopic disease and this approach is supported by the results from several series which document a statistically significant poorer overall and disease-free 5-year survival in patients with margins less than 10mm. Authors demonstrated that there is no significant difference in patient survival rates up to 10 years between patients with resection margins of 10mm or greater and those with margins of just 0-9 mm. Recently, a 2mm minimum margin has been proposed but in appropriate circumstances an even narrower margin may be acceptable. In our series we obtained complete devascularisation of all the treated lesion, with an average safety margin of 13,6 mm at MDCT. The shape of non-enhanced area at MDCT, as a result of heat diffusion in both the lesion and its surrounding parenchyma, reflects the morphology beads distribution during TAE. In our experience we did not use any drug and TAE has been carried out only with very small microparticles (100 mm); RFA was then performed immediately after TAE, in order to avoid that hypoxic effect could be reduced by the opening of collateral feeding arteries to the lesion.",

            "text": "Results from our series demonstrate that single-session combined therapy is an effective and safe treatment for liver metastases not available for surgical resection. This approach provided good local tumor control and did not increase complications. Additional advantages of the single-session therapy include the ability to treat tumors that are not feasible for stand-alone RFA. However, our experience, like the series reported in literature, is limited to few patients and further prospective studies should verify efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness of single-session combined therapy for liver metastases. To overview recent results of stem cell therapy and future indications Background: Stem cells have a remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. When a stem cell divides, each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function, such as a muscle cell, red blood cell, or brain cell, among others. The broad categories of stem cells in clinical or experimental use include embryonic stem cells, those derived from blastocysts, cord blood cells and adult stem cells, which are found in adult tissues. As these grow in damaged, hypoxic tissues, they gradually become stimulated by the surrounding cells and environment to become new cells similar to those cells they come in contact with. As they grow and become specialized, they are able to transform into new blood vessels, neurons, muscle, eye, pancreas, kidney, liver, bone marrow among others, depending on the local tissue influences. The animal and human studies using human umbilical cord or autologous bone marrowderived stem cell treatments in various clinical disease states have shown encouraging early results. Purpose: We have evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular delivery of bone marrow-derived stem cells in treating patients with disease states, including critical limb ischemia, diabetes mellitus, cerebral palsy, chronic renal failure, muscular dystrophies, dilated cardiomyopathy and spinal cord injury, among others. Materials/Methods: We treated 353 patients (245 males, 108 females), mean age, 37 (1-72) years over a 40-month period. Ethical clearance from Institute board and informed written consent were obtained. The group included patients with critical limb ischemia, cerebral palsy, chronic renal failure; muscular dystrophies, dilated cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus and spinal cord injury, in all of whom conventional medical and/or surgical management had failed to provide relief of symptoms or was contra-indicated. Bone marrow aspiration was done from the iliac crest from the individual patient. The stem cells were isolated under aseptic conditions and were injected into the same patient on the same day. Each patient received injections of a pre-determined dose of stem cells intra-arterially at the site of disease, such as the occluded arterial segment in critical limb ischemia, in the pancreatico-duodenal artery in diabetes mellitus, in the spinal artery in spinal cord injury, in the coronary artery in dilated cardiomyopathy, in the extremity artery in muscular dystrophy, in the renal artery in chronic renal failure and in the distal internal carotid artery in cerebral palsy in addition to the optimal medical and/or surgical treatment. Follow-up was done at 1, 3 and 6 months with pre-determined end points. As an example, the end-points in patients with critical limb ischemia included healing of ulcer, relief of rest pain, safety of treatment, pain free walking distance, imaging evidence of collateral vessel formation, and qualityof-life assessment. Results: All procedures were technically successful, without complication. No problem was encountered at the site of bone marrow aspiration, at the site of arterial access or at the site of stem cell injection in any patient. In addition, no systemic side-effect of this therapy was observed in any patient, thereby, establishing the safety of this treatment method, irrespective of the underlying disease state or the site of stem cell delivery. All patients were followed for a minimum period of 6 months for adverse effect evaluation. Clinical outcomes were variable in different disease states. As an example, clinical and angiographic improvement was seen in 78% patients with critical limb ischemia with avoidance of amputation in most situations. Improvement in control of diabetes was observed in majority of patients with a significant decline in the dose of insulin required for control of blood sugar levels in the short term. However, the response was not encouraging in patients with muscular dystrophy and variable in patients with chronic renal failure and cerebral palsy. It was observed that patients under 12 years of age with cerebral palsy responded better to this therapy than the older patients. Beneficial response to this therapy was also seen in some patients with chronic neurological deficits due to spinal injury. Conclusion: Intra-arterial delivery of bone-marrow derived stem cells is safe irrespective of its site of injection and produces no deleterious effects at the site of aspiration or injection in the intermediate term. This form of therapy has the potential to produce striking clinical response in some disease states, such as critical limb ischemia, diabetes mellitus and chronic spinal injuries, even in situations where conventional medical surgical therapies have failed or are contra-indicated. It remains to be established whether the immediate clinical benefit is sustained over time at long-term follow up. Learning Objectives: 1. To overview modern methods of cytotoxic therapy in IR 2. To explain differences between pharmacologically and mechanically induced apoptosis 3. To report on recent studies and results in antiangiogenic therapy and resorbable microspheres The fundamental role of angiogenesis in tumor progression was first suggested by Folkman et al in a classic study describing that tumors cannot grow beyond 1 or 2 mm without the formation of new blood vessels. This complex process facilitates tumor progression and eventually tumor metastatic spread. Several factors, including tumor hypoxia, growth factors, cytokines, oncogene activation, and other mutations interact to stimulate angiogenesis. Therefore, targeted inhibition of angiogenesis can be achieved at any of these levels with various treatments designed to bind growth factors with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), inhibit the downstream signaling from tyrosine kinase receptors, or disrupt the interaction between proliferating endothelial cells and matrix components. Theoretically, following anti-angiogenic treatment, the tumor vasculature may undergo morphologic changes, whereby immature blood vessels are pruned, blood vessel tortuosity and dilation decrease, and a closer association between pericytes and endothelial cells is induced. As a result, tumor blood vessel leakage, vascular permeability, and interstitial fluid pressure decrease. If chemotherapy is administered after anti-angiogenic drug-induced vascular changes, it can be quite advantageous since it would result in increased intra-tumoral drug delivery as well as an increase in the number of tumor cells that are sensitive to chemotherapy. A recent study showed that there is improved penetration of the chemotherapy into the tumor upon vessel normalization. Until recently, there was no standard systemic therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The introduction of antiangiogenic therapy such as the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib has 367 C RSE",

            "text": "Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course changed the management algorithm of patients with advanced disease. As antiangiogenic drugs are generally cytostatic rather than cytotoxic, combinations involving conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies with anti-angiogenesis drugs may be useful for maximizing therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, given that HCC presents as hypervascular tumor(s), combining therapies that inhibit angiogenesis on a molecular and mechanistic level seems particularly attractive. Finally, given the fact that TACE directly causes angiogenesis through activation of the hypoxia-mediated pathway (hypoxic changes in the tumor directly up-regulate angiogenesis via VEGF) thereby potentially limiting its efficacy, it was logical to combine TACE with agents that directly counteract this angiogenic activity. The administration of anti-angiogenic therapy in conjunction with locally delivered chemotherapy can help improve penetration of the chemotherapy into the tumor upon vessel normalization. One of the most critical and specific factors for blood vessel formation is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is an endothelial cell mitogen that regulates proliferation, permeability and survival of endothelial cells through inhibition of apoptosis. HCC is one of the most vascular solid cancers, associated with a high propensity for vascular invasion and a high expression of VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF has been correlated with increased tumor invasion, intratumoral microvessel density, disease recurrence, and poor prognosis. One approach to inhibit angiogenesis is to use monoclonal antibodies directed at VEGF. Bevacizumab is such a humanized monoclonal antibody that through its binding to VEGF prevents the interaction of VEGF with its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. When unblocked, this interaction may lead to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation. VEGF expression is known to play an important role in the development of HCC and the degree of its expression is reported to be associated with tumor size and histologic grade. Several studies have explored the potential therapeutic role for bevacizumab in patients with HCC. The results of the first US Phase II study combining anti-angiogenic therapy with TACE were recently presented. Tumor response and safety of concurrent bevacizumab and TACE were evaluated in 26 patients with unresectable HCC (ECOG status 0-2, Childs-Pugh stage A-B, BCLC B-C). These patients received bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every two weeks, in addition to TACE, in a 6-week cycle (on average, 1-3 cycles). Primary endpoint was tumor response, assessed by MR imaging at baseline, and 3 weeks post-TACE, using size (RECIST), and contrast-enhancement (EASL). Secondary endpoints included safety and survival. On follow-up imaging, index lesions had a mean decrease in size of 13% (p < 0.0005). Using RECIST, eight (35%) achieved partial response, fifteen (65%) had stable disease. Targeted tumors demonstrated mean decrease in contrast enhancement of 69% (p < 0.0005). By EASL criteria, fourteen (60%) patients had complete or partial response, and nine (39%) had stable disease. The disease control rate was 100% using either criteria while undergoing treatment. Median overall survival was 13.5 months with 10 patients still alive. Fifteen (58%) patients experienced grade 3/4 toxicities possibly related to either therapy with most toxicities resolving within 2 months of therapy. Overall, the combination therapy of bevacizumab and TACE was reasonably well tolerated in unresectable HCC patients, with 100% disease control rate by imaging criteria and median overall survival of 13.5 months.",

            "text": "The rationale for combining anti-angiogenic drugs with TACE is abundantly clear. If this combination is proven to be safe and found to increase time to tumor progression, it is very likely that it will become common clinical practice. The data have so far been promising. It should, however, be stressed that further research is necessary to demonstrate a clear survival benefit. This new prospective in the management of patients with unresectable HCC has opened the door for translational studies in order to identify potential predictive markers of response to this combination therapy and guide patient selection. By the end of 2011, we should have the results of several clinical trials that are currently underway that will hopefully lead to a more effective treatment for this highly lethal cancer. Learning Objectives: 1. To describe the need and potential benefits of bioabsorbable and cell-coated stents 2. To explain physical prerequisites of bioabsorbable and cell-coated stents and mechanical considerations 3. To report on recent results and explain the possible role of bioabsorbable and cell-coated stents in future Stent implantation has revolutionized angioplasty and is well established for coronary and peripheral arteries. Stenting is an effective measure to treat elastic recoil and dissection following balloon angioplasty. As bare-metal stents revealed to create relatively high rates of restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia, the drug-eluting stent was developed. Drug-eluting stents are coated by a thin polymer layer, containing an antiproliferative drug. Gradual release of the drug successfully prevents restenosis, which led to a widespread implementation of this technology. A disadvantage, associated with reduced cell proliferation, is the prolonged ingrowth of the stent mesh into the arterial wall, which, in turn, may be responsible for subacute and late stent thrombosis. At least, late stent thrombosis remains a concern, despite prolonged antiplatelet therapy. In addition, some coating and carrier polymers of drug-eluting stents may cause chronic vessel inflammation. Furthermore, arterial stenting may cause other possible long-term disadvantages. Due to positive remodeling of the vessel a mismatch in diameter might result. Arterial side branches may be partially occluded by stent struts. Consecutive bypass graft surgery may be hindered, especially in stented coronary arteries. Non-invasive coronary artery imaging of the in-stent lumen by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is often impaired due to artifacts. All that is reason enough to inspire R&D for searching for better solutions. In order to address the initial advantages of a metal/polymer-coated stent, regarding sealing of intimal dissections, prevention of elastic recoil and additional delivery of pharmacological agents to prevent restenosis in the first six months, and in order to avoid the above mentioned medium and long-term shortcomings, the concept of a bioabsorbable stent appears attractive. Bioabsorbable stents might provide all of the features of a metallic stent but disappear from the artery once \"their job is done\", obviating the need for long-term antiplatelet therapy. In recent publications the term \"bioabsorbable stent\" is eventually replaced by \"bioresorbable scaffold\", which might be more appropriate and better differentiates these new approaches from conventional stent technology. Requirements of an ideal bioabsorbable stent (or bioresorbable scaffold) are adequate radial force to prevent early elastic recoil, a certain scaffolding ability to avoid constrictive late vessel remodelling and restenosis, biocompatibility of material to prevent vessel inflammation, and especially for coronary application, reduction of artifacts, to allow for noninvasive imaging modalities such as CT or MRI. In addition, the stent or scaffold may also be used as a vehicle to deliver antiproliferative agents to suppress neointimal hyperplasia. Current bioabsorbable stents/bioresorbable scaffolds are made Munich 2011",

In comparison to metallic stents, the radial strength of PLLA is lower and may result in early recoil post-implantation. The bioabsorption rate is relatively slow and may still result in restenosis. In addition, PLLA stents are radiolucent, which may impair accurate positioning using fluoroscopic guidance. In contrast, magnesium stents have higher radial strength due to their favourable Young's modulus. Several bioabsorbable stents/bioresorbable scaffolds are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical trials, following the pioneering Igaki-Tamai PLLA Stent. Among them are the Abbot Vascular everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA), the REVA Poly (Iodinated Desaminotyrosyl-Tyrosine Ethyl Ester) Carbonate Stent (REVA Medical, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA), the IDEAL Poly (Anhydride Ester) Salicylic Acid Stent (Bioabsorbable Therapeutics, Inc. Menlo Park, CA, USA), and, as the only metal stent concept, the balloon-expandable AMS-1, -2 and -3 (Biotronik, Berlin, Germany). The AMS-1 is composed of 93% magnesium and 7% rare earth metals. The newest generation (AMS-3) comprises a modified magnesium alloy, reduced strut thickness, and a bioresorbable matrix for the controlled release of an antiproliferative drug. Preliminary results indicate clinical advantages of the new technology over currently available drug-eluting stents, but this has to be confirmed in further investigations. Furthermore, arteries treated by bioabsorbable stents have demonstrated the recovery of the responsiveness to vasoactive agents such as nitroglycerin. However, a potential shortcoming of bioresorbable polymer scaffolds may be the occurrence of strut fractures. The cell-capture stent represents an alternative approach to overcome the shortcomings of the drug-eluting stent technology. After the discovery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), the GenousTM EPC capture stent (OrbusNeich, Florida, USA) was developed which provides a proprietary coating, containing antihuman CD34 antibodies. These antibodies are supposed to capture circulating EPCs, aiming at rapid recellularisation of the artificial stent surface. Nevertheless, the porous nature of stent structures is still enabling the ingrowth of myofibroblasts to the luminal side. A novel concept of a cell-coated stent (\"BioStent\") is based on the complete embedding of a self-expanding stent into a tissue engineered vascular graft. The aim of this concept is the complete exclusion of the thrombogenic atherosclerotic plaque by a solid tissue layer on the one hand and the luminal coating with a functional endothelial cell layer on the other hand to guarantee a physiological hemocompatibility and to protect the underlying cell layer with regard to uncontrolled cell proliferation. The creation of the BioStent follows the principles of tissue engineering and starts with the harvesting of autologous tissue (fatty tissue, venous tissue, e.g. great saphenous vein). The endothelial cells and the vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) are cultured to a sufficient number. In parallel, the components for an autologous fibrin-gel are isolated from the patient's blood. An injection moulding technique based on a cell suspension of vSMC in fibrin-gel allows the complete integration of the self-expanding stent structure into a viable tissue, followed by a luminal endothelial cell lining. After a pre-conditioning of the seeded cells within a custom-made bioreactor system at physiological flow, pulse and pressure conditions, the newly formed tissue withstands the force of crimping and release without a significant damage of the endothelial layer. The BioStent concept presents a platform technology. By exchanging the embedded and luminally seeded cell types, e.g. the combination of fibroblasts with urothelial cells for stenting of ureter and urethra, the use of respiratory epithelium for endo-bronchial stenting or the lining with mucosa cells for a gastrointestinal application. Due to the production time of up to 6 weeks the BioStent is not available for emergency interventions. The autologous cell lining is strictly limited to an individual patient. Nevertheless, the cell-coated, \"personalized\" stent structure offers a novel opportunity for the treatment of lesions with high risk of restenosis in the future. ",

Portal pressure was monitored continuously during the infusion. In case of portal pressure exceeding 16-20 mmHg, the infusion was stopped and the liver perfused by saline until the pressure dropped back to normal level. After transplantation the catheter was removed and the tract embolized by surgical sponge. We evaluated patient survival, rate of serious adverse events and diabetes compensation.

To learn about the potential of assisted intervention Various interventional procedures can be done in the CT room if one can place a needle with precision within the body and many of these procedures have been extensively studied and published. The approaches commonly practiced are free hand technique with or without the use of fluoroscopy. Many radiologists are hesitant to use CT fluoroscopy because of the radiation involved and the free hand technique without the use of fluoroscopy is not very popular with beginners as they warrant a long learning curve to build confidence. Precise and accurate positioning of a needle for any such CT-guided interventions requires the perfect selection of entry site/point on the patient's body surface and accurate calculation and execution of the depth and angle in two planes (orbital and Z axis). Even slight variation in the point of entry or angulations of the needle can result in missing the target point. The patient's respiratory variation adds to the difficulty in getting the needle to the desired point. These factors result in increased number of needle adjustments and passes to get the needle tip at the desired position in free hand procedures leading to increased tissue injury thereby contributing to increased complications. The more the number of needle adjustments increases the need for additional axial CT image acquisition to check the needle's position. This, in turn, increases the total radiation dose to the patient and also considerably increases the duration of the procedure. This paper presents the advantages of application of robotics for assistance in medical interventions under CT guidance. Our experience with the robotic system (PIGA CT from Perfint, India) proves its ability to achieve greater accuracy for needle placement on the target point with minimum needle passes and manipulations thereby reducing tissue injury, the total procedural radiation dose and the total duration of procedure.

To learn about future imaging potential and developments Knowledge of tumor response after loco-regional therapies, as thermal ablation and chemoembolization, is crucial for assessing tumor response (1, 2) . Imaging modalities including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have been used to monitor treatment response. A change in tumor size at CT or MR imaging is the accepted criterion for assessing response after chemotherapy, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumor (RECIST) (3, 4) . Target lesions are measured using a single linear summation. These criteria were primarily designed for evaluation of cytotoxic agents that induce cell death. Hence, assessment based on changes in lesion size can be misleading when applied to other drugs or interventional procedures. In the early post-treatment period after loco-regional therapies tumor necrosis does not often result in change in size. In 2000 a panel of experts convened by EASL (European Association for the Study of the Liver) recommended response criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) be amended; they proposed to take into account tumor necrosis induced by the treatment rather than tumor size (5, 6) . Viable tumor was defined as contrast uptake in the arterial phase of CT, MR or contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). In 2010, the guidelines endorsed by EASL and AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) were adapted and published by a group of HCC experts (7) . The proposed amendments to RECIST criteria in the evaluation of tumor response for HCC target lesions are based on lesion enhancement in the arterial phase of imaging modalities. Complete response is defined as the disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in target lesions. Partial response is considered at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters of viable target lesions. Progressive disease is the appearance of one or more new lesions, as for RECIST. A new lesion can be diagnosed as HCC if it is at least 10 mm in diameter and if it shows the typical imaging pattern in dynamic imaging studies (hypervascularization in the arterial phase with wash-out in the portal or late phase). In a recent study, Authors evaluated loco-regional therapies response with RECIST criteria and with amended criteria; they concluded that RECIST missed all the complete response and underestimated the extent of partial response (8) ",

To assess possible future use of cone beam CT in tumour therapy Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a minimally invasive palliative treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or hypervascularized liver metastases, who are not candidates for surgical resection, thermal ablation or liver transplantation. TACE allows delivery of a high concentration of chemotherapeutic agents and embolic particles into the lesions causing ischemic cell death. To increase efficacy of TACE and to minimize injury to the surrounding liver tissue, selective administration of chemoembolic material is desired. Selectivity of TACE mainly depends on vascular anatomy and on the correct identification of tumor feeding vessels. Until now, TACE is typically guided by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) providing two-dimensional (2D) projection images, which depict hepatic arteries superimposed on one another. This might lead to misinterpretation with consequent incorrect or suboptimal positioning of the catheter. Correct identification of tumor feeding vessels is more difficult in tumors that are not hypervascularized and in liver parenchyma with inhomogeneous density and contrast. So far, the limitation of conventional DSA has been overcome by acquisition of multiple oblique projections, which, however, lead to increased contrast medium volume and radiation dose as well as prolonged examination time. A novel approach for increased detection of tumor feeding vessels is cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), which permits assessment of complex vascular anatomy after a single injection of contrast medium in a main or segmental hepatic artery. Dedicated reconstruction of the volume data set provides not only 2D slices but also three-dimensional (3D) vessel models such as MIP, MPR, VRT, SSD etc. CBCT offers the option of selective perfusion imaging and comparison to baseline cross-sectional imaging to evaluate if tumors are covered completely by local treatment and to change the catheter position if necessary. In addition, CBCT allows post-interventional evaluation of the accumulation of embolic material within the tumor. Furthermore, dual-phase CBCT (obtained during arterial-and portal venous-phase) has shown to provide sufficient image quality to detect HCC lesions. The sensitivity of CBCT for detection of HCC lesions seems to be much higher compared to DSA and almost equal compared to MRI. However, there are also some limitations. The field of view is spatially limited to the dimension of the flat detector, i.e. in some cases whole coverage of the liver might be difficult depending on the size of the detector and the organ. Other problems are artifacts arising from respiratory/bulk motions or high-density objects. In addition, it remains unclear if CBCT results into lower contrast medium volume, radiation dose and shorter examination time compared to conventional DSA. In conclusion, the use CBCT during TACE provides essential information, which directly influences the procedure. CBCT allows the acquisition of CT images to assess arterial perfusion and accumulation of embolic material without the need to change the modality, thus increasing safety, accuracy for identification of tumor feeding vessels, and treatment efficacy. This information gain is of particular importance in hypovascularized and central lesions.",

To review the role of imaging post UFE including contrast enhanced MR Uterine artery embolization (UAE) for symptomatic uterine fibroids has evolved into a well-established alternative to hysterectomy worldwide [1] . UAE induces infarction of leiomyomas resulting in ischemic necrosis, hyaline degeneration, and size reduction with up to 95% of patients experiencing resolution or major symptom relief after treatment [2] . Imaging plays a crucial role to determine which therapy can be offered to a women suffering from fibroid disease. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for establishing the diagnosis of leiomyoma as the cause for hypermenorrhea, dysmenorrhea or bulk symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior in determining the location, size, and number of fibroids and determing which therapeutic approach is feasible [3] . Moreover, it offers unique information on fibroid tissue composition, vascularity of the fibroids and arterial supply. It is more reliable than ultrasound for the detection of adenomyosis or coexisting endometriosis which may cause similar symptoms. CT does not play a role in assessing the extent of fibroid disease or ruling out other pathology that may mimic fibroid-related symptoms. Imaging prior UAE includes transvaginal ultrasound by an experienced operator. MRI should be considered in all patients being evaluated for UAE since it provides considerable additional information compared with ultrasound and affects clinical decision making in a substantial number of patients [4] . MRI is especially useful for the assessment of a multifibroid or significantly enlarged uterus, in cases with clinical suspicion of adenomyosis and endometriosis, inability to assess the ovaries by ultrasound and in those women, were the option of uterine sparing surgery must be weighed against UAE as the primary treatment. Ultrasound imaging is useful to depict fibroid shrinkage but reduction in uterine and fibroid size is not strictly correlated with clinical success. Even marginal reduction in size of the treated fibroids may result in significant improvement in the fibroid-related symptoms. If patients do not report improvement and/or complain about recurrent/new symptoms at any time after UAE contrast-enhanced (ce) MRI (including MR Angiography) is recommended. The role of MRI in this setting is to assess uterine integrity, the position, viability of fibroids and detect collateral supply. MRI can depict the changes associated with sloughing or expulsion of fibroids, cavitation or fistula formation, endometritis, and uterine necrosis [5, 6, 7, 8] . Persistent perfusion of leiomyoma may lead to regrowth of leiomyoma tissue and recurrence of symptoms. Complete infarction of leiomyomas indicates technical success of UAE and is associated with longterm clinical success [9, 10] ",

Despite good results in a prospective single arm study this technique has not yet been used by many interventionalists. I have been using the SHNB for more than three years in every UFE with very good success. The superior hypogastric nerve plexus is part of the sympathetic nervous system and collects the sympathetic nerves from the pelvis including the innervations of the uterus. The superior hypogastric plexus is typically located in front of the 5 th lumbar vertebral body just below the aortic bifurcation. The idea/concept of the SHNB is to block this nerve plexus with a long-acting local anesthetics such as ropivacain 0.75% (Naropin) or bupivacain 0.5% (Carbostesin). Both anesthetics provide a regional nerve blockage of 6-10 hours. The technique of the SHNB is quite straight forward. After embolisation of the contralateral uterine artery the catheter is filled with contrast to mark the aortic bifurcation. A 21G needle is advanced \"downthe-barrel\" in the midline aiming below the aortic bifurcation. The needle is advanced till it hits the anterior aspect of L5. Once the needle reaches the bone contrast is injected to confirm the correct location of the needle tip in the pre-vertebral space. Then 20ml of local anesthetics is injected under fluoroscopic control. The time needed for the SHNB, starting with cutting the whole in the drape till pulling the needle, is only 7-10 minutes. Rasuli et al. found that all patients could be discharged home within 6 hours of the procedure with only 6% re-admission. I tend to keep the patients over night for better observation. Typically the women have no pain for several hours following UFE. After the SHNB wears off patients start to have mild to moderate pain. Conclusion: SNHB is easy, quick and safe and therefore should be adapted by IR. References: 1. Rasuli et al. JVIR 2004 , 15:1423 ",

            "text": "pruned tree, stasis, total occlusion Although a technically advanced procedure, uterine fibroid embolization is well within the skill set of most well trained interventional radiologists. The procedure can be broken down into several segments. First is selective catheterization of the uterine arteries. This is usually done sequentially, first left then right. Most experienced operators use micro-catheters, at least in small vessels, to avoid flow-limited spasm. The initial 4 or 5Fr catheter is placed in the internal iliac artery either at the origin of the uterine artery or above it. It is used like a guiding catheter for the subsequent selective placement of the micro-catheter into the uterine artery, usually to the level of the transverse segment of the vessel. Next, embolization is performed. The choice of embolic is discussed in detail in the presentation. Beyond the choice of embolic, embolization is performed under fluoroscopic guidance, with intermittent injection. The embolization should be free-flow as the embolic material will flow to the fibroids first. Fibroid vessels are larger than normal myometrial branches and generally have more rapid flow than normal branches. This allows for preferential occlusion of the fibroid vessels in the initial part of the embolization procedure. It is important to ensure a stable endpoint of embolization after the procedure and generally we wait for 5 minutes to ensure no revascularization of the fibroids. The endpoint of embolization has been defined in qualitative terms but not yet quantitatively. For most embolics, an endpoint of near stasis is recommended, while for trisacryl gelatin microspheres, less occlusion is recommended, usually described as slow forward flow forward. The endpoints will be demonstrated in the presentation. Finally, angiographic imaging is usually performed immediately after embolization to document the level of vessel occlusion. Many operators then routinely do an abdominal aortogram to assess for ovarian collateral flow, although it is detected in only about 5% of cases. Ovarian collateral flow is more likely in patients with a large uterus, large fundal fibroids, and those with a history of prior pelvic 373 C RSE ",

It is, however, the task of every physician to learn from mistakes and to organize his practice in such a way that the risk for errors is reduced to a minimum. The first and important step is to deal with problems in such a way that doctors are willing to show and to discuss their errors. The local department environment plays an important role in this. The basic understanding should be that no doctor ever wants to hurt a patient. The best way to deal with these problems is to understand that an error is part of a system error and the doctor is part of this system. Train the system. Training through medical simulation can be helpful in improving catheter skills, but will not prevent specific complication in relation to UFE. There are 5 fields to be identified where complications in relation to UFE can occur. 1: Indication. Treating the patient for the wrong indication can be a reason for a serious complication.

But there are also rare anastomoses to the colon and the iliac artery. Not knowing and thereby not recognizing these anastomoses will lead to accidental embolisation of the non-target area; sometimes with devastating consequences. 3: Training. Image-guided catheter treatment might look straight forward, but proper training and maintaining the skills is essential in preventing complications. 4: Materials. Knowing your materials, and especially the embolisation endpoint of the materials, is very important. Too much material will cause massive necrosis, infection and has been seen to result in dead. Also, particle size is important to prevent shunting of material. 5: Organisation. Most complications, however, in medicine are due to bad organisation. No clear back-up system to deal with unexpected problems. During out of office hours patients being unknown to the physician on call. Making a medical mistake is not malpractice, not learning from this and even repeating this is malpractice. Every complication should be an important learning moment. The application of TEVAR to chronic type B dissection is a controversial subject. The indication is most commonly the presence of a thoracic false lumen aneurysm; however, the factors that influence the safety and effectiveness of this management are clearly different than those considered for patients with non-dissected, degenerative descending aortic aneurysms. The fundamental difference in TEVAR management for these two lesions is that the degenerative aneurysm is completely isolated from the circulation if no endoleaks exist while the aortic false lumen aneurysm remains partially exposed to systemic arterial pressure due to its contiguous relationship and lumenal continuity with the residually patent aortic false lumen below the endograft. In order to further examine this issue it is necessary to review some of the recent published reports. Multiple studies have demonstrated that 20% to 40% of patients with type B dissection who are initially managed successfully by medical therapy will eventually require intervention for aneurysmal degeneration of their chronically dissected aorta. Ultimately, the successful outcome of TEVAR management of chronic dissection is dependent on multiple factors, both anatomical and physiological, including characteristics of the individual dissection process such as the trajectory of the flap extension and its resultant influence on residual interlumenal aortic communications and flow patterns after stentgraft placement. A recent large single center study of 51 patients with chronic type B dissection with a mean aortic diameter of 6.2 cm reported no in-hospital/30-day deaths after TEVAR; no complications related to downstream branch vessels and an actuarial overall survival of 78% at 60 months with a mean follow-up of 27 months. Another report of a multi-national study of TEVAR for chronic type B dissection detailed a 30-day mortality of 0%. New data continue to emerge, but at this snapshot in time it appears that TEVAR results",

A variety of complications have been detailed following TEVAR in the setting of chronic type B dissection, including progressive false lumen expansion below the distal margin of the endograft, conversion of the type B lesion to an acute type A process by retrograde extension form the proximal margin of the stent-graft, and rupture. Of note, the 1-year outcomes of the INSTEAD trial that studied management of chronic type B dissection by comparing medical therapy versus endograft placement concluded that elective stent-graft placement does not improve 1-year survival and adverse events despite favorable aortic remodeling. There was no difference in all-cause mortality with cumulative survivals of 97% for medical therapy and 91% for endovascular repair (P=.16). In considering optimal therapy for patients with chronic type B dissection, future investigations may better define improved selection algorithms that will help identify subsets of patients who are likely to benefit most from stent-graft management, as well as, those who may have disease patterns that are best treated by open repair or optimal medical therapy. One conclusion is clear, our current idea of best management of these patients is transient and will soon be replaced by improved understanding and insights provided by a legion of contemporary trials, the results of which are anxiously awaited. The treatment of thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAA) remains controversial. At the present time there are three treatment modalities, which must be evaluated and compared to define the optimum therapy for patients: open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, hybrid surgery (retrograde visceral revascularisation followed by conventional TEVR/EVR) and complete endovascular solutions which involve branched and fenestrated endografts. The literature regarding thoracoabdominal aneurysms is relatively poorly populated and difficult to interpret. One of the main issues that must be borne in mind when evaluating results is the type of aneurysm treated. Thoracoabdominal aneurysms are traditionally classified using the Crawford classification. Aneurysms traditionally deemed high risk for adverse outcomes (mortality/paraplegia) are the extensive aneurysms type II and III, but series often contain variable numbers of type I, IV and V aneurysms. There are numerous single centre series for the open treatment of TAAA that report excellent results. However, these results seem unable to be replicated in community series where peri-operative mortality rates approach 20%. In addition, it is difficult to define exactly how many patients are deemed unfit for open TAAA surgery. At the present time working figures for TAAA surgery would appear to be indicated that up to 40% of patients may be unsuitable for open procedures and that the operative mortality rate is approximately 20% in unspecialised centres. The hybrid approach was popularised before total endovascular solutions became widespread. This approach uses traditional surgical techniques to debranch the visceral aorta using retrograde grafts from the distal aorta or iliac arteries. This debranching is then followed by TEVR/EVR. Early series of this technique did not appear to offer any significant improvements in outcome to the open techniques. However, in recent months several new series have been published that suggest the mortality rates for type II aneurysms is 15% with a lower paraplegia rate than open surgery. Approximately 80% of all patients may be treated by hybrid surgical techniques. The total endovascular solution for TAAA has now become relatively widespread although reports are still sparse. The technique uses branched and fenestrated endografts to exclude the aneurysm and restore patency to the visceral vessels. Advantages to this technique are associated with the avoidance of open surgery, significant visceral ischaemia and reduction in blood transfusion requirements. The disadvantage of these complex endovascular techniques is the applicability to only a proportion of patients (maybe 60%) and the wait for a custom-made endovascular graft (3 months) . The advent of non-custom-made solutions will significantly improve the current delay to therapy. In terms of results, the only large series is from the Cleveland Clinic. These results in a series of patients with more comorbidities than an open surgical cohort demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality although the paraplegia rate remained high. At present it is the author's policy to consider totally endovascular solutions for the majority of patients with TAAA. In patients with chronic dissection, endovascular solutions are difficult and these patients may benefit from a hybrid approach, as may patients who cannot wait 3 months for therapy. The place of traditional open surgery is reserved in the authors practice for those with defined connective tissue diseases. utilised.",

There are many strategies for closing type I endoleaks as described above. There is less certainty about which endoleaks need treatment. 1. To present indications of IR treatments in patients with non-colorectal metastasis 2. To discuss factors that may affect selection of IR treatments 3. To analyze the role of IR therapies with respect to other available treatments Technological knowledge are growing faster than the scientific one because before being accepted it needs to overcome the phases of feasibility, efficacy and comparison (phase I, II and randomized trials) to reach the highest level of evidence. Evidence quality can range from meta-analyses and systematic reviews of double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials at the top end, down to conventional wisdom at the bottom. The levels of scientific evidence, very well known by oncologists, make difficult answering the question: \"when to refer a patient with non-colorectal liver metastases for inteventional radiology treatment.\" This is because there are no levels 1 of evidence, for any interventional radiology technique over traditional chemotherapy or surgery in this subset of patients. There are many techniques that are eligible to intervention radiology, and there are new molecular targeted drugs that further complicate the scenario. It is therefore necessary to suggest a new strategy to design the future trials to provide a shared response to the question. It is important that radiologists do not see their new technique only with the eyes of love and that oncologists should not always await the classical randomized studies, whose results you have in years, to introduce in well selected patients new opportunities of therapy. Each of us has to take a step backward to really move forward. At this time we will discuss how to approach this issue with an integrated or sequential strategy, combining some interventional techniques with traditional and intra-arterial chemotherapy, with particular attention for liver metastases from cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. Until 1996 there was no established standard chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. After 1997 Gemcitabine became the standard one, but in more than 14 years no significant improvement was added to the results obtained with Gemcitabine alone. Until 2010 also biliary cancer had not an accepted standard chemotherapy. Now international guidelines indicate at least one chemotherapeutic line for biliary cancer, at least two chemotherapeutic lines for pancreatic cancer and at least four for ovarian cancer. In the first two cancers, prognosis is still dismal, with a median survival never exceeding 12 months; therefore, we must look for new integrated strategies because up to now nothing modified their natural history. Among the different radiological techniques the following will be discussed: intra-arterial chemotherapy, chemoembolization with slow-release drug-eluting beads, radio-chemoembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres and radiofrequency ablation. Also, the first data of hepatic chemosaturation therapy with a percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedure will be considered. At first the results of interventional radiology AFTER the failure of the recommend chemotherapeutic lines will be discussed for each tumor. At second the results of interventional radiology BEFORE the failure of the recommended chemotherapeutic lines will be discussed for each tumor. At third the results from combined strategies like FIRST APPROACH will be discussed for pancreatic and biliary cancer. The ONLY conclusion of my presentation is to underline again that if we do not start with multidisciplinary teams in every day work life, very few progresses will be appreciated. ",

To analyse the role of interventional therapies with respect to other available therapies Hepatic chemoembolization is a procedure usually reserved for patients with hepatic malignancies not amenable to surgical resection or local ablation. Hepatic tumors known to respond to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) include hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and metastases from neuroendocrine tumors, melanomas, colorectal carcinoma, and sarcomas (1). Cutaneous melanoma accounts for more than 90% of all melanomas, whereas ocular melanoma is only encountered in 5%. Approximately 95% of ocular melanomas arise in the uvea and the remainder in the conjunctiva. Any part of the uveal tract can be affected, including the iris, ciliary body and choroid. Iris melanomas are less aggressive compared to ciliochoroidal tumors. Uveal melanoma is a rare tumor but is the most frequent primary intraocular malignancy in adults (2) . It represents about 6% of all melanoma diagnoses (3) . The incidence of uveal melanoma is 4,000 per annum in the United States or 4.3 cases per million (4) . The 5-year overall survival for patients with ocular melanoma ranges between 50% and 70% (5) . Molecular pathogenesis of uveal melanomas appears to differ from that of cutaneous and mucosal melanomas. Factors related to the primary tumor that influences prognosis include cell type and number of mitoses, lesion size location, scleral or extrascleral invasion, extension beyond Bruch's membrane and optic C RSE",

Uveal melanomas have a significant tendency for metastasis to the liver (2) . Up to 40% of patients have been reported to have hepatic metastases present at initial diagnosis and the liver becomes involved in up to 95% of individuals who develop metastatic disease (8) . The liver is the predominant site of metastases in more than 80% of patients, with metastasis occurring hematogenously (6, 7) . Despite aggressive therapy, the median survival of patients after diagnosis of liver metastases is 2 to 7 months (9). The 1-year survival is estimated to be 10% (10) . Controlling, therefore, hepatic metastases is essential to extending patient survival. Many systemic treatment strategies using immunotherapy, such as interferons and interleukin-2; chemotherapy, including dacarbazine, cisplatin, temozolomide, or lomustine or the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide, alone or in combination, have been used for patients with metastatic ocular melanoma (11, 12) . However, they have shown exceptionally poor activity against metastatic uveal melanoma, and only 9% of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma are candidates for surgical resection. Furthermore, surgical approaches are not clearly indicated due to frequent liver relapses and distant spreading. A number of locoregional treatment options directed to the liver are in clinical development for patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver. Intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy and isolated hepatic perfusion have been shown to have some success in the local treatment of liver metastases (13), but no standard treatment protocol exists for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.",

Several groups have reported their experiences with chemoembolization for patients with liver metastases from uveal melanoma (14) (15) (16) . Hepatic artery chemoembolization combines hepatic artery embolization with simultaneous infusion of concentrated doses of chemotherapeutic drugs (17) . Advantages of this technique include rendering the tumor ischemic, achieving high drug concentrations within the tumor and reducing systemic toxicity. The tumor becomes ischemic because the blood supplying macroscopic hepatic tumors is predominantly derived from the hepatic artery (18) . Chemoembolization using a variety of chemotherapy agents may result in regression or stabilization of hepatic metastases. Although generally considered a safe intervention, liver chemoembolization can potentially be associated with complications such as hepatic failure, hepatic infarction, renal failure, tumor lysis syndrome, sepsis, and even death. Certain inclusion criteria apply for patients considered candidates for chemoembolization (19) . Tumor burden should be no more than 75% of replaced liver parenchyma because of the high risk of postembolization hepatic failure in these patients.",

However, the higher response rate may have reflected patient selection. Multivariate analysis identified serum alkaline phosphatase and metastasis-free interval as the main independent prognostic factors for survival, not the approach to treatment. Carrasco et al.

(16) conducted a phase I trial of chemoembolization with cisplatin, thiotepa and lipiodol for primary and metastatic liver cancer, including three patients with ocular melanoma. In two of the three patients partial remissions were achieved that lasted 3 and 16 months, respectively. However, 4 of 30 patients in his series succumbed to complications. Patel et al (18) performed chemoembolization with BCNU in 24 patients.

Three patients responded to chemoembolization, five patients had stable disease, and four patients had disease progression. They concluded that repeated chemoembolization offers a palliative treatment option in patients with oligonodular liver metastases from uveal melanoma. Fiorentini, et al performed chemoembolization using beads preloaded with irinotecan in ten patients (13) .

            "text": "In conclusion, there are no effective long-term treatments for the majority of patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to liver. Chemoembolization and other locoregional therapies such as radioembolization have been implemented in selected patients, however, more studies need to be performed to standardize and refine the appropriate administered regimen and technique. Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss indications of interventional treatments in breast liver metastases 2. To comment results of interventional therapies in comparison with other treatments 3. To analyse the role of interventional therapies in the management of breast cancer Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to the bones, lungs, and liver, at which point the cancer is considered a systemic disease and is associated with a poor prognosis. Importantly, liver metastases are present in the majority of patients; however, metastatic disease is confined to the liver in only 5%-18% of patients (1) (2) (3) . Although a variety of chemotherapy regimens have been tried, median overall survival time for patients with metastatic breast cancer involving only the liver, regardless of the degree of hepatic involvement, is 22-27 months (4-7) . Given the poor survival rates associated with the current treatments, there is increasing interest in the use of local therapies in conjunction with systemic therapy to improve the prognosis of patients with liver metastases from breast cancer. To treat hepatic metastases from breast cancer, local ablative techniques such as ultrasonography (US)-or computed-tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency (RFA) ablation, highintensity-focused ultrasound (HIFU), microwave coagulation (MWC), laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) and cryablation had been used. Common inclusion criteria for liver metastasis ablation had been: fewer than five tumors, maximum tumor diameter of 5 cm or smaller, and disease either confined to the liver or stable with medical therapy. Patients usually had previously undergone chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both, often show no response or an incomplete response to the treatment. Radiofrequency ablation So far, the effectiveness of RF ablation in the treatment of primary liver tumors and unresectable colorectal liver metastases is well established (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (25) (26) (27) (28) . Several studies have shown that percutaneous RF ablation is safe and effective in the treatment of liver metastases from breast cancer (12, 13, 20) . Meloni et al reported complete tumor necrosis in 97% of tumors. Minor complications occurred in only 2 (4%) cases. Median time to follow-up from diagnosis of liver metastasis and from RFA was 37.2 and 19.1 months, respectively. Local tumor progression occurred in 25% of patients. New intrahepatic metastases developed in 53% of patients. From the time of first RF ablation, overall median survival time and 5-year survival rate were 29.9 months and 27%, respectively. From the time the first liver metastasis was diagnosed, overall median survival time was 42 months, and the 5-year survival rate was 32%. Patients with tumors 2.5 cm in diameter or larger had a worse prognosis (hazard ratio, 2.1).",

It does not require insertion of a needle into the target area, and damage of the tissue is obtained by the thermal effect and cavitation, which is caused by US energy. Acoustic energy is absorbed, and heat is generated by delivering high-acoustic intensity to the tissue. Because it is highly focused, acoustic intensity is high only within the focal region; however, outside the focal region the intensity is substantially lower, thus minimizing the risk of unintended injury to the surrounding structures. Unlike RFA, HIFU is completely noninvasive and can be used to reach tumors deep within the body, as in this case, provided there is an acoustic window to allow the transmission of US energy. The limitations of this method is the fact that in most cases general anesthesia is required, that the ablation may not be radical, and that we still do not know the long-term results of this procedure.",

Inclusion criteria are generally restricted to the absence of extra-hepatic disease or complete response of extrahepatic metastases (usually bone metastases) to systemic therapy, no brain metastases, normal performance status and liver function test results, and the possibility to perform curative resection. The only significant factor identified was the time between primary breast surgery and the diagnosis of liver metastases, with a shorter interval being associated with a worse prognosis. However, the authors of a more recent series did not confirm this result (21) . In many surgical series (20) , there was a high rate of new hepatic metastases during follow-up that ranged from 59% (50 of 85 patients) to 67% (12 of 18 patients) and was comparable to results (53%) published by Meloni et al in 2009 (20) and expected, given the natural history of the disease. Adam et al (21) found that survival was worse when margins were macroscopically positive or small-volume disease remained in the remnant liver after resection. Adam et al concluded that surgery should be offered in combination with systemic therapy only to those patients with macroscopically resectable hepatic metastases. When compared with surgical resection, RF ablation is less invasive, less expensive, and has fewer contraindications. Moreover, since many patients will develop liver metastases after surgery, the testof-time approach, which has already been proposed for colon cancer liver metastases, could be used in patients with breast cancer liver metastases. This approach would help avoid unnecessary surgery in patients who would develop new metastases. The results of current available studies demonstrate that RF ablation can be used successfully in selected patients with liver metastases from breast cancer who have disease confined to the liver or who have stable extrahepatic disease to obtain local control of the disease. The local tumor progression rate (25%) was not negligible, and the number of patients who developed new intrahepatic tumors was high (53%); however, both findings were expected, given the natural course of the disease. The improved survival of patients in patients treated by RFA is likely due to the fact that RF ablation can be repeated if patients develop local tumor progression or new tumors. In addition, no treatment-related deaths or major complications were encountered, and the minor complication rate was 4%. Thus, RF ablation should be considered a first-line therapy with which to achieve local control in patients with metastatic breast cancer confined to the liver and in patients whose extrahepatic disease is stable with systemic chemotherapy.",

Multiple studies have been published reporting on the short-and long-term results of performing percutaneous angioplasty interventions and/or stenting for femoral artery occlusions in patients with PAD. Patency rates have been reported to range up to 93%. A metaanalysis of percutaneous angioplasty with provisional stenting compared to stenting alone for treatment of SFA lesions showed similar rates of target vessel revascularization, making both reasonable choices as endovascular treatments. However, restenosis still remains as a major limitation of the clinical usefulness of PTA and stenting. Poor long-term results, especially after the treatment of longer lesions in the femoropopliteal region, have been reported. Here, the local application of the anti-proliferative agent paclitaxel for prevention of restenosis in femoral arteries via a stent delivery system or a balloon platform only have shown that these therapies successfully inhibit or reduce restenosis. Especially, the use of paclitaxel-coated angioplasty balloons during percutaneous treatment of femoropopliteal disease seems to be associated with significant reductions in late lumen loss and targetlesion revascularization in short lesions. The use of re-entry systems in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal arteries has shown promising early results to tackle long occlusions. In summary, endovascular therapy is the first choice for long SFA occlusions in claudicants who have an insufficient response to walking exercise or as an adjunct to a training programme. ",

This was a patient with hypertension and was reported in the Lancet in 1978 with great hopes of a \"cure\" for hypertension related to renal artery stenosis. Following the initial enthusiasm there has been increasing scepticism regarding the clinical effectiveness of this procedure. At the same time the pharmacological control of hypertension has improved with many new drugs (such as ACE inhibitors) appearing on the market. One of the first problems to beset renal angioplasty was elastic recoil and a consequent high restenosis rate. These mechanical limitations of renal angioplasty for atheromatous disease were largely overcome with the introduction of balloon expandable metallic stents (Palmaz) in the early 1990s. Early randomised trials carried out in Scotland, France and Holland were set up using hypertension as the outcome measure and all returned negative results. However, these studies pre-dated the stent era and were also criticised for being small and underpowered. A further randomised trial from Holland compared renal angioplasty with stenting and demonstrated clear technical superiority of stents but this was not matched by any clinical benefit. Cochrane review summarised the situation by stating that there was clearly no huge benefit associated with renal stenting but that a smaller but clinically important benefit could be present and missed by the previous underpowered studies. This paved the way for the next three trials. The STAR (n=140) and ASTRAL (n=806) trials encompassed the a very favourable risk-benefit ratio (Hirsch et al 2006) . Usually, invasive treatment is indicated only after unsuccessful trial of at least sixmonths of exercise program. There are only a few small randomized trials comparing PTA and conservative treatment of intermittent claudication, and none that included only femoropopliteal disease. In Edinburgh trial (Whyman et al, 1996) ) sixty-six claudicant patients, among whom there were short femoral stenoses in 47 patients, were randomized to either PTA plus medical treatment (daily aspirin, stop of smoking, and exercise) or medical treatment only. At six-month follow-up in the PTA group more patients reported no claudication, (p<0.05) and were asymptomatic at treadmill (p<0.01) compared to the control group. The AB pressure index was significantly higher and patients reported lower NNHP pain score in the PTA group. However, after two-year follow-up, the groups had comparable clinical outcomes (Whyman et al 1997) . In a prospective observational study thirtynine claudicant patients with unilateral femoral lesions undergoing PTA showed some short-term quality of life (QoL) benefit but at 12 months post-PTA did not approach QoL scores of an age-matched population (Chetter et al 1998) .",

            "text": "The long-term patency rates of infrainguinal PTA vary largely in different studies. At 1 year, primary patency rates of 47% to 86%, at three years 27% to 69%, and at six years 23% to 36% are reported in the literature (Manninen H, 2008) . In one prospective, single center study with 218 femoropopliteal PTAs on claudicant patients the primary patency at ten years was only 14% and reinterventions were required during the follow-up in one-third of the limbs including surgical revascularization in 35 limbs (Laxdal et al 2002) . There are no comparative studies between the long-term results of intraluminal and subintimal recanalization for the treatment of chronic occlusions but also subintimal technique suffers from serious reocclusion problem. Primary patency rates of 22% to 62% at one year have been reported. Highly variable 1-year primary patency rates between 22% and 81% with various stents have been reported (Manninen H 2008) . In three randomised studies, although the primary success rate of stent placement was higher than that after balloon angioplasty alone, the long-term patency was not improved using stents (Vroegindeweij D et al, 1997 , Cejna M et al 2001 , Grimm et al 2001 . Midterm restenosis after long-segment femoropopliteal stenting remains a problem. In recent single-center observational study in which long segments (median length 16 cm) were covered by nitinol stent after initial failure of PTA, the primary patency was only 54% at one year. Especially poor result (22% one year patency) was obtained in diabetics (Sabeti S et al 2005) . Stent in the femoropopliteal artery is exposed to unique long-term stress in the form of repeated compression, flexion and torsion and it is probably the reason why recent studies have revealed stent fractures in up to 50% of nitinol stents 1 year after placement (Scheinert D et al 2005) and in 19% of Wallstents a mean of 43 months after placement (Schlager O et al. 2005) . The fractures seem to be associated with poorer patency and they are more common in longer stents. Surgical bypass operation with autogenous vein graft is currently the standard reference for treating long SFA obstructions. Up to 81% two-year and 69% five-year primary patency rates can be appreciated after saphenous vein bypass above knee position. If PTFE graft is is used, the long-term patency is slightly worse but still 69% after two years and 49% after five years according to a systematic review (Klinkerts P et al 2004 The general idea that is currently accepted among Interventional Radiologists and clinicians is that the field of renal artery angioplasty/stenting in atheromatous stenosis is a somewhat lost battle against medical treatment. Most of us are in the mood that \u00abmedical treatment is the best we can offer to these patients and that there are no more indication for intervention\u00bb. If one refers to the history of renal artery angioplasty, it is easy to summarize as follows: an initial period of enthusiasm in which all patients/lesions seemed as good indications, while there was an increased recognition of the need for systematic stenting of ostial stenosis. Then 3 European-based randomized controlled studies that compared best medical treatment to angioplasty/stenting failed to show significant evidence that this intervention was successful in reducing blood pressure significantly. A Cochrane review published in 2003 concluded \u00abAvailable data are insufficient to conclude that balloon angioplasty is superior to medical therapy in lowering blood pressure of patients with renal artery stenosis in whom blood pressure can be controlled with medical therapy. In patients with hypertension refractory to medical therapy, there is some weak evidence that balloon angioplasty lowers blood pressure more effectively than medical therapy. Balloon angioplasty appears to be safe and leads to fewer cardiovascular and renovascular complications. There is a need for randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of balloon angioplasty and medical therapy on the preservation of renal function in the long term\u00bb (1) (2) (3) . The next step, more or less where we stand now was that of two additional randomized trials focused on a combined outcome of blood pressure and renal function. The Star trial and the Astral trial. The overall conclusions of these RCT were also negative (4, 5) . A recent meta-analysis re-stated again the overall deceiving results of renal stenting as compared to medical treatment. This resulted in a dramatic reduction of the patient referred for stenting and motivates the present controversy. In fact, we believe that the jury is still out and that living with the idea that stenting is not indicated anymore is not only inappropriate but is also dangerous for our patients. The referring partners that used to send us patients are often not motivated enough to go into the level of details of these trials and in most of the institution and therefore there is a need for a better education in this field. First of all it appears that the two trials that are supposed to seal the case are both severely flawed and have both been repeatedly and severely challenged by several authors. Star: Small groups, only 72% (46/64 patients) were effectively stented in the \u00abstent group\u00bb, unacceptably high adverse events rate related to the technique (low volume centers, high profile platforms up to 8 F sheath..) (4) . Astral: Most (65%) centers entered less than 1 patient/year, very long inclusion period (>7 years) (5) . Randomization process based on uncertainty: a method supported by the authors of Astral on the basis of previous trial using this method, but a technique which is largely debatable (6) (7) (8) . Because of the design of the trial, the only conclusion possible is \u00abstenting in case of uncertainty is not indicated\u00bb. In addition, the patients in which stenting was deemed indicated were not studied (their outcome is not reported in the study, this a serious flaw\u2026). The authors themselves are in doubt on their results because they recently wrote: \u00abhowever, there is without doubt a group of patients with renovascular disease who do benefit from intervention and it is essential that this subset be better defined\u00bb (6) . Astral destroyed in many centers the previous patients stent era and were much larger studies. There was a move away from using hypertension as the outcome measure and renal function became the main point of focus. Put simply could renal stents improve renal function? The ASTRAL trial was appropriately powered for this outcome. Neither the ASTRAL nor STAR trials were able to demonstrate any useful clinical benefit from renal stenting. Other secondary outcomes which included hypertension, renal and cardiovascular events and overall survival also proved negative. Subgroup analysis including patients with critical lesions involving single kidneys also proved fruitless. On the downside both trials reported several serious adverse events which included both morbidity and mortality. These are disappointing but early results (5 year) and longerterm follow-up continues. These trials have been criticised on both sides of the Atlantic. Most of the criticism comes from a misunderstanding of the \"uncertainty principle\" others are frankly biased. Randomised controlled trials remain the gold standard in evidence-based medicine and cannot be matched by retrospective or prospective case series, even less so by personal \"expert opinion\". The third new trial is CORAL which is an American driven study. A composite outcome of both cardiovascular and renal events is the primary outcome. It has recruited approximately 1000 patients from several countries including the USA. Although recruitment has closed it has yet to report any results. Although there may be some moderately strong indications for renal stenting, e.g. flash pulmonary oedema and uncontrollable hypertension. Few if any were entered into the trials and these rare indications remain non-evidence based. Based on the data available there is no good evidence to support routine stenting for patients with atheromatous renal artery stenosis. The evidence will be presented and discussed. (16) . Stenting patients with a stenosis that has in reality no impact on hemodynamics result in no effect and confound the results. Conclusion 1. Renal artery stenting is of common practice in dedicated centers and despite conservative approach, common indications are not to be overlooked (listed in this paper).",

The use of .014 pressure wire to determine the pressure gradient after intra-renal injection of dopamine will likely help in selecting the patients in whom renal stenting could effectively result in lowering BP. 4. Renal artery stenting is not dead it may be well back in our daily practice provided that clinicians are well educated and the patient selection is done appropriately. 3. Patients in which unilateral stenosis is not responsible in poor control of BP but in which 6-month follow-up demonstrates reduction in kidney length of more than 1 cm on echography. 4. Patients with recurrent flash pulmonary edema and uni-or bilateral renal artery stenosis, in case of absence of cardiac disease (valvular, ischemic or cardiomyopathy). What will the future tell us? Two new RCT focused on combined cardio-vascular outcome are in progress (slow patient inclusion rate for Radar and ongoing followup for Coral) (10) . Results will not be available until 2 years. The combination of hard endpoints and a long follow-up period will maybe help in finding difference in the best medical treatment (BMT) group compared to the stent + BMT group. Besides these ongoing trials, the whole issue of appropriate patient selection is still widely opened. Arterial stenoses are frequent in patients with hypertension so that is often difficult to determine whether the stenosis is the cause of hypertension or its consequence. All RCT previously published (including the ongoing ones) selected patients for inclusion according to the angiographic grading of the stenosis severity (with various cut-off between 50 and 70%) (Coral used also 4 F catheter gradient pressure measurements in patients with less severe stenosis but this technique is inappropriate). Unfortunately, we believe that this criterion is not the best. The severity is often grossly overestimated by angiography (11) and it yields a high inter observer variability (kappa < 0.40). It is hardly possible to distinguish between 50 and 60% stenosis or between 60 and 70% stenosis (12) . On the other hand, previous work has also shown that there is poor correlation between the actual pressure drop distal to the stenosis and the angiographic severity of the stenosis (13) . The ongoing research on hemodynamic assessment of stenosis using .014 pressure wire to decide in which patient stenting is appropriate is certainly a future direction in which IR should be involved. Interventional Cardiologists have paved the way and are leading the research arena in this field (14) . For example, in a prospective study of 53 patients undergoing renal stenting, transtenotic pressure gradient at baseline and during maximal hyperemia before stenting. At multivariate analysis, dopamine-induced mean gradient was the only independent predictor of variation of both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The optimal cut-off for identification of responders was a dopamine-induced mean gradient >= 20 mmHg. Moreover in this study half of the patients referred because of subjective angiographic evaluation had a hyperhemic trans-lesional gradient below the threshold found to be predictive of improvement. Dopamine at the dose of 50 gg/kg intra-renal was the most powerful renal vasodilator (15) . One can easily conclude that failure of blood pressure improvement in the previously published RCTs There were a total of 756 patients with elective EVAR of whom 179 (24%) had serious graft complications at a mean 3.7-year follow up. 114 patients required reintervention -at a rate of 15% (4) . This was highest during the first 6 months with a late increase after 2 years. Longer-term follow-up is likely to find higher complications and reintervention rates. Factors predictive of poor outcome included large initial aneurysm size and large common iliac artery diameters. One of the most disturbing findings was that whereas there were no aneurysm ruptures following open surgery there were 27 ruptured aneurysms after EVAR (5, 6) . Eighteen of these patients died giving a mortality of 67%. Complications such as type I endoleaks, type II endoleaks with sac expansion, type III endoleaks or graft migration or kinking increased the risk of rupture. These poor results confirm those of the Pittsburgh group who found that rupture after EVAR was associated with poor outcome (7) . The late mortality associated with aneurysm rupture in the EVAR group is regarded as the \"sting in the tail\" of EVAR, and clearly should be avoided in patients with a long life expectancy. The conclusions of the papers published in 2010 on the late results of the EVAR trials showed that EVAR was not associated with a survival advantage, either in terms of aneurysm related or all cause mortality. EVAR was associated with increased graft-related complications and reinterventions and was more costly. These results were confirmed by the DREAM trial. The current economic climate brings into sharp focus both the cost of the endovascular procedures, the surveillance programmes required to detect problems during follow up and the secondary procedures required to correct the complications including aneurysm rupture. The low rate of post-operative graft-related complications confirms that no follow up is required after open surgical repair. The high rate of late aneurysm rupture means that no patient having endovascular repair can be discharged from surveillance.",

            "text": "A 60 year old fit patient with a 5.5 cm AAA should undergo surgery P.R. Taylor There is a tendency to regard all things endovascular with rose tinted spectacles. Minimally invasive techniques using modern technology must be better than maximally invasive old fashioned open surgery. The wave of enthusiasm for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is now well past and longer-term follow-up of randomised trials provides some sobering evidence which requires critical appraisal. This debate is deliberately chosen to obviate the advantages of EVAR with regard to perioperative mortality by stating that the patient is relatively young at 60 years old and fit. This patient would have a very low mortality from both open surgery and EVAR thereby removing the early advantage of the less invasive EVAR. This turns the spotlight on the durability of EVAR when compared with open surgical repair. The eight-year results of both the EVAR and DREAM trials were published in consecutive articles in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2010 (1) (2) (3) . There was a perioperative advantage in terms of mortality for EVAR which measured 3% which was maintained at four 385 Learning Objectives: 1. To review the approach according to the location of the collection 2. To review tools available. To review the Seldinger and Trocar techniques 3. To review complications of the procedure and their management Percutaneous drainage is a core skill for radiologists and should be readily available in all departments. Drains are measured by their circumference in mm (French/ Charri\u00e8re) and the smallest pigtail drains (6Fr) are sufficient for uncomplicated ascites, pleural effusions and even purulent bile and urine. Abscesses and empyema can also be successfully managed through small drains if irrigated regularly; however, this is often not practical and larger drains may be required. The liberal use of local anaesthetic is essential, sedation is rarely required, but intravenous analgesia (e.g. paracetamol, fentanyl) should be considered. In case of sepsis, antibiotic cover should always be given. The shortest and easiest access route is usually the safest. Drains may be inserted over a guidewire (Seldinger technique) or by direct puncture with a trocar-mounted drain (\"pig-on-a-stick\"). Where this is not done under real-time guidance, trocars with a safety mechanism should be considered to prevent lung or bowel injury. Needle guides for US-guided puncture remove the guesswork about needle position. Unfortunately few operators are familiar with these and many too \"macho\" to use them. Ultrasound guidance is sufficient in most cases. CT is invaluable for deep collections. For longer access routes or larger drain sizes, stiff guide wires, dilators and peel-away sheaths must be available and the operator needs to be familiar with these. Abscesses should be aspirated as much as possible at the time of drain insertion and require active management. Malignant ascites can re-accumulate quickly, sometimes requiring several drainages per month. Paracentesis can be performed safely as a daycase, but insertion of indwelling, tunneled catheters allows home drainage. This avoids repeated hospital admissions with significant cost savings and improved quality of life. Drainage of loculated and purulent effusions can be easily improved by the instillation of 100-250.000i.U. of streptokinase for 4hours. This is cheap and safe. Drain fixation and attachment of drainage bags is an art. Stoma bags attached to the skin over the drain are one of the safest ways to prevent accidental removal, but will lead to skin excoriation by urine or bile. Closed systems with an underwater trap are mandatory for pleural effusions. Complications are rare; pain being the commonest. Injury to bowel/ lung may be managed conservatively, but surgical support should be considered in all cases. The lecture will illustrate basic drainage techniques, the use of needle-guides and safety-catheters, indwelling catheters for home drainage, streptokinase injection and chemical pleurodesis. ",

The complications of the treatment and their management Simple liver cysts are acquired and benign lesions without connection to the biliary tree consisting of cuboidal biliary epithelial cells. Although they are usually asymptomatic they should be treated whenever they are symptomatic. In patients with symptomatic simple liver cysts percutaneous aspiration is not a definitive therapy as it is associated with a high recurrence rate. Before Bean and Rodan reported their experience with alcohol sclerotherapy of symptomatic simple liver cysts, surgery was the only therapeutic option. Since then several papers of percutaneous treatment of simple hepatic cysts have been reported with successful results. Hydatid cyst disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus is a parasitic disease that can emerge at any region of the body. However, liver is the most involved organ. Treatment options for liver hydatid cysts include chemotherapy, surgery, and percutaneous drainage. Complete recovery is observed only in less than half of the patients treated with anti-parasitic chemotherapy, in general. Although surgery is considered as the traditional treatment option in hydatid cysts of the liver, surgical treatment results are associated with high mortality, morbidity, and recurrence rates and longer hospital stay in the literature. Successful results of particularly the \"PAIR technique\" (Percutaneous Aspiration-Injection-Respiration) as well as \"Catheterization technique with hypertonic saline and alcohol (we call it as \"Standard catheterization technique\")\" and \"Modified catheterization techniques such as MoCaT or PEVAC\" published in the literature of the last two decades led to the acceptance of percutaneous treatment as an alternative to surgery for a successful treatment option of liver hydatid cysts. Simple renal cysts can be found incidentally in most elderly patients. Treatment is not required for simple renal cysts as most of them are clinically silent. When they are associated with flank pain, hypertension, and obstruction of the collecting system, a treatment modality should be indicated. Although symptomatic renal cysts were managed by surgical techniques in the past, percutaneous treatment of symptomatic simple renal cysts with single or multiple-session sclerotherapy has already become the first-line treatment option as it is associated with high success rates. The rates of major complications of the percutaneous treatment in patients with simple hepatic and renal cysts are very low. However, major complications of percutaneous treatment of liver hydatid cysts are around 10% which are treated by percutaneous techniques. proposed for such aneurysms. However, the broader public should understand that chimney techniques have mainly been used to rescue renal arteries after misplacement of a standard stent-graft, or in some acute situations. It would be a mistake to advice patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms to be treated with chimneys in the elective setting. There is simply not enough evidence (at this moment) to do this. The final choice towards a fenestrated procedure is depending on patient characteristics (e.g., age and co-morbidity), and aneurysm characteristics (e.g., diameter and anatomical features). In 2011, to a certain extent, a patient has the right of choice if optional. Economic considerations also play a role considering the enormous problems of health care systems around the world. The fenestrated technique is now entering its second decade and has matured. [2] [3] [4] Results have shown to be excellent and durable. [5] [6] [7] In addition, although technically more challenging again, the fenestrated technique has been used successfully to treat proximal type I endoleaks or extension of disease in patients having undergone previous standard endovascular and open surgery. [8] [9] [10] [11] Limitations of the fenestrated technique It would be presumptuous not to recognize a number of limitations, both anatomical and non-anatomical. On the non-anatomical side it must be obvious that fenestrated techniques are characterized by a greater complexity therefore requiring extensive extra-mural, human, physical and economic resources. Furthermore, additional considerations in the choice between open and endovascular repair, such as threshold diameter for treatment, and co-morbidity of the patient, must be taken into account. The anatomical limitations should include the manufacturing of the graft, the evaluation of technical challenges, and the experience of the \"team\". The anatomical limitations of the standard fenestrated technique become obvious if one keeps the necessary steps during the deployment process in mind: first, the graft needs to be repositioned to its final position to facilitate catheterization; second, the insertion of stents inside the renal arteries must be achieved correctly. Any anatomical feature rendering these two processes difficult to execute, makes the already complex technique even more tedious. Severe angulation of the proximal neck or the iliac arteries, narrow iliac arteries, previously inserted surgical grafts all can render repositioning of the graft during catheterization more difficult. Insertion of stents into the renal arteries and renal artery patency are at risk in case of small or diseased renal arteries, short renal arteries with early bifurcations, or a sharp take-off from the aorta. Other anatomical particularities can also increase the difficulties of the procedure: aortic branches in close proximity to each other render designing the graft more difficult and sometimes impossible; angulation of the proximal neck increases the difficulty to determine the correct level of the small fenestrations for the renal arteries; thrombus inside the proximal neck is not only a risk factor for endoleak but also for embolization during repositioning; a small neck diameter can render the catheterization process more difficult because there is not enough room to maneuver with the predesigned catheters.",

We therefore clearly suggest following these patients with duplex ultrasound, standardized abdominal X-ray, measurement of systolic blood pressure and renal function, with CTA to be reserved in case of doubt. Fenestrated stent-grafts are designed to treat patients who have unsuitable proximal necks for standard endovascular repair. These grafts are customized to the individual patients' anatomy. The graft used is a three-part composite system based on the Cook Zenith device. The first part is a tube fitted with the customized fenestrations. The second part is a bifurcated graft and the third part a contra-lateral limb. The technique involves four additional steps compared to a standard Zenith graft deployment. First a partial deployment (in terms of diameter) of the proximal tube graft (constrained by diameter reducing ties). This allows for repositioning of the graft during the second step, which is the catheterization of fenestrations and target vessels, usually the renal arteries, but sometimes also the superior mesenteric artery. The third step is a full deployment of the tube graft. The fourth and final step is sequential stenting of the fenestrations, to maintain full appositioning and therefore perfusion, a better seal at the level of the fenestrations, and perhaps a better fixation of the graft. A detailed comprehensive step-by-step technical approach has been published by Moore et Over the past two decade, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has revolutionized the treatment abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Open surgical repair has steadily given way to EVAR and the midand long-term results of EVAR are encouraging (1, 2, 3) . The early \"home-made\" devices as well as the first-generation of commercially available endograft systems in the early and mid-nineties were characterized by large diameters and significant rigidity, necessitating surgical exposure of the common femoral or the iliac arteries to facilitate introduction. This, in turn, made the procedure cumbersome (prolonged procedural times) due to the necessity of a surgical set-up including operating room personnel. Subsequent generations of stent graft systems became progressively more flexible and acquired smaller profiles. This development, coupled with the availability of percutaneous suture-mediated closure (PSMC) devices, opened up new avenues to the interventionist, leading to early reports on percutaneous endograft implantation appearing at the turn of the century. Almost all currently available endograft systems for treating AAA have French sizes below 24 F. Closure devices: Of the various devices currently available in the market, the two suture-mediated devices most commonly used for percutaneous closure of endograft access sites are the Prostar XL and the Proglide devices (Abbott Vascular). The Prostar XL has two sutures attached to four needles designed to deploy the sutures in a criss-cross fashion to facilitate closure of the arterial entry site. The Proglide device has only one suture deployed through two needles. For sheaths between 12 and 14 F, two Proglide devices may be used as an alternative to one Prostar XL; the two devices are sequentially advanced at an angle of 60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 to each other in order create criss-cross sutures. For sheaths exceeding 16 F in size, generally the Prostar XL system is used. Although a single Prostar XL device has been successfully used for sheaths up to 24 F, most centres still tend to use two devices to optimize the chances of haemostasis.",

Thereafter, a one-cm skin incision is made and the subcutaneous tract is bluntly dissected down to the level of the femoral artery to facilitate insertion of the devices. If two devices are used, they are inserted one after the other. The device has a side-hole for insertion and removal of the guide wire which makes the exchange of devices possible. The sutures are deployed prior to insertion of the stent graft system. After completion of the endograft implantation, the sutures are knotted and the knot allowed to slide down to the artery by applying traction on the appropriate suture thread; the knot is then pushed firmly against the outer arterial wall by means of a knot pusher and tightened by applying traction to the second suture thread. For ensuring complete haemostasis, further manual compression may be necessary for 3 to 5 minutes as the patients are generally anti-coagulated. graft for both renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery, and a scallop for the celiac artery. Both fenestrations for the renal arteries are flexible in position and should accommodate the majority of complex aortic abdominal aneurysms. However, it is worth pointing out that an additional fenestration renders the technique more complex, requiring more extensive experience but also better angiography equipment. This author believes that all fenestrated and branched grafts should be done in operating theatres with fixed imaging as an ideal environment, but agrees that standard fenestrated grafts can be done with mobile imaging. Nevertheless, the cut-off point seems reached when the fenestrated technique becomes more complex and requires lateral fluoroscopy viewing for catheterization and stenting of the superior mesenteric artery. Another important issue with standardized fenestrated grafts is the even more important patient selection in the acute situation. In other words, one will need a lot of experience to determine whether a patient is suitable for this type of graft and procedure in a stressful situation, with a great temptation to go for it in view of the poor alternative options. It is clear that caution is mandatory, and a prospective registry needed, to determine the safety and efficacy of these off-the-shelf fenestrated devices.",

The technique has reached a high degree of maturity and published results are surprisingly consistent and durable. This authors' opinion is that the fenestrated technique is the first treatment option for most suitable complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. In the context of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR), type 2 endoleaks are defined as an endoleak occurring into the aneurysm sac as a result of retrograde flow from side branches of the aorta. In practice, the main side branches responsible for type 2 endoleaks are the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and the lumbar arteries. Type 2 endoleaks may occasionally arise from retrograde flow in accessory renal arteries arising from the aneurysm sac, although these are much less common. Early in the experience of EVAR, type 2 endoleaks were routinely treated by embolization, which in large part contributed to the high reintervention rate in the EVAR arm of the EVAR 1 trial. However, with the accumulation of increased data on follow-up after EVAR, it became evident that while type 1 and type 3 endoleaks are risk factors for aneurysm sac expansion and rupture, type 2 endoleaks per se did not seem to be a risk factor for late rupture. As a result of this, the standard management approach for type 2 endoleaks in the last decade has been observation by interval imaging, either by CT or by ultrasound, with treatment reserved for an increase in aneurysm sac diameter on serial imaging. Intervention for increasing aneurysm sac diameter is not supported by good evidence and there are many interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons who would not intervene for a type 2 endoleak even if there is documented evidence of aneurysm sac expansion. However, the 10-year results of the EVAR 1 trial have revealed that late aneurysm rupture is a small but worrying cause of late mortality, which erodes the success of EVAR compared with open surgery. Late rupture occurred in a high proportion of cases where there was documented ongoing sac enlargement, and some of these patients had type 2 endoleaks, which gives support to their treatment when there is increasing aneurysm sac diameter. Type 2 endoleaks may be treated by several techniques, which include transarterial embolization, embolization after direct puncture of the aneurysm sac and by a variety of surgical techniques including laparoscopic clipping of the offending aortic side branch (or branches). My favoured technique is transarterial embolization. Embolization of the IMA involves the cannulation of the middle colic branch of the superior mesenteric artery with a reversed curve catheter (Sidewinder or Simmonds 1 or 2) and a hydrophilic guidewire. Once this sometimes challenging manoeuvre is achieved, a microcatheter and wire can be passed relatively easily distally into the left colic branch of the IMA, and then the IMA itself. The usual embolic agents are coils, although glue and Onyx are other popular embolic agents. Embolization of the lumbar arteries is usually more challenging and involves the catheterization of the iliolumbar branch of the ipsilateral internal iliac artery, which is a branch of the posterior division of the internal iliac artery, although the exact site of origin may vary. The usual technique is to catheterise the internal iliac artery with a cobra or reversed curve catheter, followed by catheterization of the iliolumbar artery with a microcatheter. Further passage of the microcatheter to the offending lumbar artery may be straightforward, although it is often quite technically difficult, due to the presence of very small tortuous communicating arteries between the iliolumbar artery and the lumbar arteries. Once the microcatheter has been passed to the lumbar artery implicated as causative for the type 2 endoleak, the choice of embolics used is similar to those used for",

In a patient cohort with 445 patients, Etezadi and colleagues noticed a success rate of about 90% for devices smaller than 16 F and about 80% for larger devices. The complication rate after successful PSMC was significantly lower as compared to that after surgical exposure of the vessel. However, there was no difference in the complication rate between the two groups, if failed PSMC cases were taken into consideration. Seromas occurred significantly more often after surgical closures, whereas pseudoaneurysms more often after PSMC. PSMC procedural time was significantly shorter than that for surgical closure. Interestingly, obesity and vessel calcification did not significantly influence the outcome (4). In another series of 292 patients, Lee and colleagues report a technical success rate of 94% and a late complication rate as low as 1.9% (6) . A success rate of 100% has been reported by Haas and colleagues in a small group of 12 patients as early as 1999 (7).

A further contribution toward achieving this goal may come from increasing experience of the interventionist with the handling of percutaneous closure devices as well as from improvement in closure device design. Consequently, EVAR for AAA treatment could well become an established percutaneous procedure in most centres in the decade to come with the percutaneous approach leading to shorter hospital stays as compared to those after surgical exposure of the vessel. To present the RF ablation techniques for renal cell carcinoma 3. To report on complications and strategies to avoid complications and enhance the results Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has evolved considerably in the last 15 years through expandable, cooled and multi-tined probes to deliver reliable treatments for small (<4cm) renal tumours. However, if image-guided ablation (IGA) is to become the standard of care for such disease the IR will have to be able to confirm to the multidisciplinary tumour group caring for these patients that they can deliver subtotal treatment rates of <5% and little or no late tumour recurrences. If this standard is to be ensured the IR must deliver renal tumour ablation in an optimised setting ideally with both US and CT guidance and formal anaesthetic support. Published data [1, 2] suggest that if subtotal treatments are to be minimised using current RFA devices then the technique should be applied to sub-37mm tumours with due diligence in terms of probe placement accuracy and treatment coverage. Probe re-stationing has been advocated to ensure tumour coverage with adequate margins using current RF probe technology; however, absolute intra-procedural confirmation of treatment completion becomes more problematic after positioning. \"Impedance roll-off\", temperature dosimetry and gas obscuration have proved to be problematic measures of treatment adequacy but with accuracy and adequacy, excellent oncological results can be obtained. Given current RF technology it seems appropriate to offer RFA to sub-40mm tumours. Some authors have advocated pre-embolisation [3] to enhance the ablation volumes achieved with IMA embolization. The procedure is technically successful in the majority of patients, with higher technical success rates for embolization of the IMA compared with lumbar artery embolization. In our cohort of 13 patients, no patient had further increase in sac diameter perfusion post embolization. We have experienced no major or minor complications to date. Unilateral common iliac aneurysms are present in 43%, and bilateral common iliac aneurysms in 11% of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. In these cases EVAR requires distal extension of the aorto-iliac stent graft into the external iliac artery with coverage and embolisation of the internal iliac artery (IIA). Sacrifice of the IIA is associated with a wide range of complications from buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction to more serious pelvic, bowel or spinal cord ischaemia. While a number of combined endovascular and surgical techniques have been described to preserve IIA patency iliac branched grafts (IBDs) allow a completely endovascular means of maintaining IIA flow in patients with aorto-iliac aneurysms. Patient suitability: Clinical criteria Identifying which patients are at greatest risk from IIA occlusion is difficult. Active patients and those with bilateral iliac aneurysms are the groups most commonly considered for IBDs Anatomical criteria Only 50% of patients with aorto-iliac aneurysms are suitable for IBDs with a number of size and morphological restrictions/contraindications. Absolute contraindications include an aneurysmal or heavily stenotic IIA and a CIA lumen less than 18mm. Relative contraindications include a tight aortic bifurcation and marked iliac tortuosity. If the CIA length is shorter than 50mm the common iliac part of the IBD will protrude above the aortic bifurcation and the bridging stent cannot be placed using the crossover technique and access from the arm is required.",

To report, based on current results, what the conditions for a successful treatment are Introduction: Ablation by any of the previously discussed techniques is now firmly established in the armamentarium of renal tumour therapy. Pending randomised trials, the accumulating follow-up data of large cohort studies show that they can produce long lasting disease control, amounting to cure in a substantial majority of cases. These techniques are now viable alternatives to and beginning to challenge the role of partial nephrectomy. Outcome: If the larger reported series of RFA of renal tumours are considered, than a pooled sample of >500 cases treated by percutaneous RFA followed for a median of 10-57 months can be evaluated. From these data a primary success rate of 79-97% can be predicted; which is further boosted to 90-100% after a second, third or more ablative sessions. Data on percutaneous renal tumour cryotherapy are less extensive, nevertheless a group of >250 cases can be analysed. The reported success rate is better than with RFA at 94-98%, but this is over a shorter follow-up period of 7-19.2 months. What is clear is that both modalities are viable alternatives to surgery. But the surgical and percutaneous ablation series cannot be directly compared as there are differences in selection and tumour size. Undoubtedly selection bias will begin to narrow with the passage of time and increasing technical experience, but currently cases for percutaneous ablation need to be carefully selected.",

            "text": "The ideal tumour is that which has a favourable shape, size and location. Round lesions are theoretically more suited for RFA whilst oval lesions may be better suited for cryoablation, as the latter often require multiple needles and the 'ice-ball' is ellipsoid in shape around the needle tip and shaft. Peripheral lesions, exophytic masses and lesions surrounding by perinephric fat are also good candidates, whilst central lesions and those richly perfused are not, although there are described ways of overcoming these limitations; e.g. by prior vascular occlusion. Similarly those near critical structures, such as the ureter and adjacent to the bowel or pancreas are also technically challenging. Again, techniques such as hydrodissection (with dextrose for RFA) or aero-dissection can be used to create a window of safety. But these are technical limitations; and issues used to assess for technical suitability for percutaneous ablation. Regarding tumour biology, there are no tumour types that are intrinsically not suitable for ablative therapy. Even the most aggressive cell type (say Fuhrman grade 4) would be suitable for attempted cure by ablation, as long as it was technically feasible to ablate the tumour with a suitable penumbra of treatment. Natural History of Small Renal Masses: However, there are other issues to do with the natural history of small renal masses that the interventionalist needs to be aware of. Emerging data show that asymptomatic small renal masses (some use <4cm as the cut off for 'small' and others define it as <3cm), have a distinct and separate epidemiology to large, symptomatic renal masses. Many small renal masses are of benign or non-aggressive aetiology, e.g. angiomyolipoma and the oncocytoma. Non-invasive diagnosis of these tumour types is not always reliable, and in some partial nephrectomy series up to 20% of small renal masses are of such benign cell types. Accumulating data on the follow up and surveillance of these lesions RFA. Largely anecdotal evidence suggests that this is the case but problems of treatment adequacy seem more likely to be overcome with the enhanced treatment dosimetry and coverage provided by cryoablation (CRA). In terms of dosimetry and consistency of results the urologic community has argued in favour of CRA [4] but if careful and consistent technique is utilised RFA can obtain sound oncologic results in sub-35mm renal tumours. Almost all renal tumours are accessible for image-guided tumour ablation regardless of anterior or posterior location [1, 2] . Although more centrally located tumours are reported to have a higher rate of subtotal treatment these can usually be addressed by adequate treatment without adverse outcome. Critical attention should, however, be paid to structures such as the pelviureteric junction, tail of pancreas and the closely related adrenal gland which, if inadvertently injured, can give rise to intra-procedural hypertension. The basic operative premise is that the operator should take time carrying out adequate contrast-tinted (2%) hydrodissection, displacing adjacent critical structures such that a thorough and adequate tumour ablation can be carried out. This should aim to also treat the related subjacent renal cortex and ensure that the tumour-parenchyma interface is completely treated. Imaging follow-up suggests that RFA is effective in oncological survival terms but there is a small incidence of late local recurrence of approximately 4% which warrants longer term imaging follow up. The IR should routinely attend the Urological Tumour Board and be aware of the relative merits of image-guided renal tumour ablation versus open partial and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. In particular, image-guided ablation has been shown to have minimal influence on post-treatment renal function and is usually well tolerated with a reported complication rate of approximately 4% (>Clavien Grade 2).",

It is the authors view that when faced with a large renal mass (say 4cm) or a mass of complex shape where the need for repeat ablation can be predicted (because of the size or the shape), than the intra-renal extent of the tumour should be preferentially targeted at the first ablation and good margin coverage ensured here, as this area will always prove difficult to evaluate of surveillance. Residual tumour is often revealed as an area nodular or crescent shaped enhancement. Rim enhancement: Other changes that may be seen on follow-up are a 'bulls-eye' appearance as the ablated mass develops a rim of surrounding fat, with a more peripheral soft tissue rim. This may be seen in up to 75% of cases (more commonly with exophytic lesions). The rim may show linear enhancement, due to peripheral perfusion. This has been reported in up to 20% of masses after cryoablation, and often disappears after 6 months. Experimentally, it has been shown that rim enhancement denotes partial coagulative necrosis caused by lower temperatures at the edge of the ice-ball. Although one cannot yet be categorical, the author believes that rim enhancement after the first year should be taken as suspicious for residual disease. Post-ablation calcification has rarely been seen with angiomyolipoma. Increased perinephric stranding is often seen soon after ablation, representing an inflammatory response, but this gradually diminishes. If progressive infiltration is seen, especially if along the needle path, then active disease should be suspected. Size as a measure of success: Decrease in size as a surrogate for success, can be a difficult to judge. Only a minority completely disappear, even after total ablation. More usually, there is sometimes an immediate slight increase in size, followed by a gradual diminution in dimensions (around 30% at the end of the first year). Decrease in size is said to be more common after cryoablation rather than RFA. Biopsy as a measure of Success: All this discussion of the limitations of follow-up imaging raises the issue of post-treatment biopsy as a measure of treatment success. Not many centres have used these as the pathology is difficult and there is always the issue of sampling error. This will be further discussed. To summarise, accumulating data show that ablation is a successful alternative to surgery for the treatment of small renal tumours. Most success is seen with exophytic masses, <3cm in size, peripherally located and away from critical structures. Treatment success can only be assessed on follow-up imaging. Of the various changes seen on follow-up imaging residual enhancement is the key indicator of success. The limitations of current surveillance policies are discussed above. have shown that they can grow very slowly, and sometimes hardly at all; and the risk of metastasis during follow-up is very low. This raises the increasing question, of whether we should obtain cytological and cellular confirmation of all small renal masses before deciding on active treatment, whether surgical or ablative. Failing that whether we should maintain a period of surveillance to gauge the growth characteristics of a given small renal mass before deciding on treatment. It has been stated that <2 cm masses should be followed, and treatment selected once they exceed 3 cm in diameter. This is certainly a safe policy as the likelihood of occult metastasis at this size is negligible. These are emerging dilemmas with ablative policies, and will occupy many of our minds in the years to come. Assessing Treatment Success: But a separate and perhaps more germane issue is how to judge treatment success. In the initial explorations of the ablative techniques, there were some alarming reports of apparently viable tumour tissue on immediate histological examination of successfully ablated renal tumours. These reports have now been refuted, by the appreciation that the pathology of ablated tissue very soon after treatment is difficult to interpret. Cell viability after ablation is not easy to gauge, and apparently healthy looking cells may in fact be undergoing indirect cell injury. This inability to definitely measure treatment success is in many ways the largest hurdle that the ablative therapies face, when compared to the surgical route. Successful surgery is apparent as soon as the pathology report is available, but ablative therapies can only be assessed eventually by the less satisfactory and slower method of follow up imaging. Follow-up Imaging: Regarding follow-up imaging there are no defined surveillance polices. But one often used is 3,6,12 and yearly after for the first 5 years. Follow-up can be by CT or MRI (the two modalities are probably equivalent, but the former is often the preferred option). What is undoubted is that, whichever modality is selected, both a pre-and post-contrast study (i.e. a proper renal mass protocol) is important as residual enhancement is the key indicator of viable tumour tissue and the need for re-treatment. Difficulties with Assessing Enhancement: It is of course a pre-condition of all ablative treatments that an amount of surrounding normal tissue should be included as the penumbra of the treatment zone. This can vary between 5 and 10 mm around the tumour, but it is not uncommon to see a degree of altered enhancement as a rim around the treated area. This is especially so immediately post-ablation. Viable tumour can be difficult to exclude at the edge and this should be monitored further for growth. The absence of enhancement within the main body of the mass is the key consideration when assessing treatment response. Absent enhancement is taken as a surrogate for non-viable tissue. But this is where the importance of both a pre-and post-contrast study becomes clear. Ablated tissue, whether heated or frozen will usually be of a higher density (by up to 20HU) than normal renal parenchyma. This makes enhancement a difficult feature to gauge. On a subjective glance, successfully ablated tissue may be misinterpreted as enhancing because of its residual high density. To accurately assess true enhancement the pre-and post-contrast density should be measured within the mass, using carefully placed region of interest cursors, positioned over the solid areas, avoiding fat or calcium, and the incremental rise after contrast is measured.",

An increment <10HU after contrast is considered 'normal' and compatible with successful ablation. An intermediate rise 10-20HU is more problematic, and unfortunately often encountered. In this situation, a policy of watchful surveillance should be chosen and retreatment recommended only if growth of this area is observed.

The technique of provocative angiography and its indications 3. To review the complications of provocative angiography Provocative angiography: Gastrointestinal bleeding is intermittent; frequently stopping and restarting. It has been documented that in 40-80% of patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage the GI bleeding will stop with bed rest and medical therapy. Therefore, the use of provocative agents to reactivate gastrointestinal hemorrhage that has already stopped is controversial. Some strongly feel that once bleeding has stopped, it is both dangerous and potentially life threatening to attempt to restart it. On the other hand, every experienced interventional radiologist has encountered patients who have had multiple negative endoscopies, angiograms and barium studies attempting to localize the lesion responsible for gastrointestinal bleeding. Negative angiograms are wasteful in terms of effort and expense. They are invasive, uncomfortable and have morbidity. Therefore, it is precisely in this group of patients that provocative angiography may be indicated. However, the decision to provoke GI bleeding should never be taken lightly or unilaterally. Both consultations with the patient's referring gastroenterologists and surgeons and ensuring that sufficient blood is readily available for transfusion is required before attempting to provoke rebleeding. We first published our experience using provocative angiography in 1982. Some provocative agents such as vasodilators and fibrinolytic agents were used to reactivate bleeding that had stopped. Since GI bleeding is intermittent often starting and stopping spontaneously, other agents, anticoagulants, such as heparin were used to keep patients actively bleeding from the time the interventional team is first notified until the angiogram is performed. Using interventional measures to provoke or prolong GI bleeding increased the rate of active extravasation seen in patients with lower GI bleeding. Prior to using provocative measures only 32% of our patients undergoing angiography for lower GI bleeding had extravasation on the diagnostic angiogram. However, with the use of provocative angiography the percentage of positive cases increased to 69% The danger of provocative angiography is the potential to reactivate GI bleeding that is massive and uncontrollable. This complication has not occurred in our almost 30 years of experience using this technique.",

Therefore, empiric embolization of the left gastric artery will have an depending on the bleeding site. The range is from 0.035 to 0.010 inch, the diameter varies from straight to compex shaped coils and different loop sizes. Some are combined with silk or dacron to be more thrombogenic. Length differs from 5 to 500 mm. There is also a big variety of detachment mechanisms. Detachable coils are excellent for occlusion of bleeding visceral aneurysms and/or pseudoaneurysms. One of the therapeutic goals is to prevent the parent artery and filling of the aneurysmal sac with detachable coils is almost an easy going procedure. The goal for the lower GI tract is to occlude the hemorrhage feeding vessel as peripheral as possible. Special ways of delivery of the coils are necessary, e.g. the usage of coil-pushers or detachable coils. Vascular plugs: there might be an indication for their use to occlude the \"front door\" in bigger sized arteries, which can be intubated with a diagnostic catheter, like the GDA. There is no indication for the lower GI tract, because proximal vessel occlusion has to be avoided. Particles and microspheres: if the bleeding point is not reachable very selectively, a \"shower\" of a small amount of particles is, especially in the UGIT, possible and allowed, with a calculated risk of soft tissue necrosis. If the hemorrhagic point in the lower GI tract is not reachable, a very limited amount of particles or spheres can be injected. The size should be limited to bigger than 250 \u03bcm. For the LGIT the end arteries are the limiting factor of embolization. Gelfoam: this might be an ideal embolic agent for hemorrhage embolization in the LGIT due to its potential of recanalization within a short period of time. Glue: either in the UGIT and the LGIT there are very limited indications for liquid embolic agents. Mainly for bleeding av-Malformations or fistulas it may be recommendable to use glue. It also can be administered into pseudo-aneurysms, just to occlude the outer surface of the artery. A special indication is the retrograde embolization of variceal bleeding in the case of portal hypertension. Onyx: there are some publications reporting embolization procedures of GI-bleeding with this liquid agent. Indications could be (pseudo-)aneurysms or other bleeding sites. The liquid can be administered like a \"coil\" to occlude the feeding vessel at a certain point. Theoretically the preinjected DMSO may work like an embolic agent too due to its spasmogenic side-effect. For the LGIT there is a risk of occlude a whole vascular territory due to its \"lava-like\" behaviour. Ethanol: its usage should be limited to especially experienced interventionalist and has its indication in the treatment of bleeding AVMs or variceal bleeding. Stentgrafts: for bleeding sites on main stem arteries it is mandatory to preserve the parent artery. To exclude the bleeding site like dissection or pseudoaneurysms it is possible to cover the pathology and prevent the artery from occlusion. Alternatively bare metal stent covering with trans-stental occlusion is an option. Summary: Due to the anatomical specialities in the upper and lower GI tract there are clear indications for the usage of special embolic agents. Depending on collateral pathways the selection of material differs between hemorrhage indication in the UGIT and LGIT. For emergency and life-threatening cases straight forward procedures are necessary, for chronic bleeding indications more sophisticated procedures are possible.",

However, glue has also been used successfully without ischemic complications if superselective application is performed. In 14 patients with insufficient coagulation, superselective TAE was performed with N-butyl cyanoacrylate without clinical signs of bowel infarction [20] .

The latter two factors are also reasons for relapse of bleeding. How much is enough during embolotherapy in patients suffering from LIGB? Embolization treatment in these patients is always an individual decision in terms of embolization level, choice of embolic material and definition of treatment endpoint outweighing the risk of rebleeding against the risk of ischemic complications. If the patient's conditions are critical including unstable blood pressure, embolotherapy must be performed until the bleeding has clearly stopped during control angiography. If treatment is performed in a patient with chronic intermittent LGIB only very selective embolization can be recommended, because surgery can be performed safely in case of recurrency if the source of bleeding has been identified. 85% chance of controlling any potential future bleeding from that lesion. Similarly, most duodenal hemorrhage occurs from lesions supplied by the gastroduodenal artery. However, the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery and its branches may supply a significant percentage of patients with bleeding duodenal lesions.

The techniques preventing bowel infarction Vascular anatomy of the bowel is the key of understanding and preventing of ischemic complications after transarterial embolization (TAE) in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). The mesenteric collateral network comprises 2-3 arcades including the marginal artery of the colon and gives rise to the terminal vasa recta supplying the wall of small and large bowel. The risk of infarctions following TAE is based on the sparse intramural arterial network of the colon behind the level of the vasa recta. If TAE includes proximal arcades or the marginal artery in a way that permanent occlusion of more than 4-5 vasa recta (1 vas rectum per cm bowel length) results, the risk of insufficient intramural collateralization is increasing. Between the early 1970s and the 1980s embolotherapy had to be performed using standard 5 French catheters proximal to the level of the vasa recta and resulted in rates of bowel infarctions between 13% and 33% due to territorial ischemia [1] [2] [3] . The preference of treatments by intraarterial vasopressin infusion was the consequence despite several disadvantages of this therapy, like cardiovascular side effects and high recurrence rate [4] . In the 1990s availability of microcatheters and microcoils brought out renewed interest in embolization treatment of LGIB. Capability of microcatheters to reach vasa recta clearly decreased the frequency of major ischemic complications to 0-6% (mean value 2.0%, median 0% in reported series). Based on more than 300 cases published in case series consistent low risk of serious ischemic complications was shown, if superselective embolization succeeded [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . If only strictly superselective TAE of vasa recta is performed, the risk of infarction to the colon is 0% [13] ; however, atherosclerosis, vasospasm and vessel tortuosity may compromise superselective catheterization and embolization.

Current 3D-techniques are typically based upon FSE/TSE sequences acquired with respiratory triggering using navigator techniques and thin near-isotropic voxels. Consideration of thin source images together with post-processed images is mandatory for clinical analysis [4] . While hepatobiliary contrast agents exhibit high signal intensity within the bile and, thus, directly visualize the duct lumen, Gd-enhanced T1-w MRI shows ducts with intraluminal low signal intensity and can be used as a \"dark-fluid\" technique. Gadoliniumenhanced FS T1-w MRI is ideal to image the ducts and adjacent soft tissues. Functional information may be obtained by adding secretin, which stimulates pancreatic secretions allowing for better visualization of strictures and ductal anomalies [1] . Clinical application of MRCP MRCP is a useful tool in diagnosing benign biliary disease [5] [6] [7] [8] . The list of clinical applications includes [1] : -clinically relevant biliary anomalies prior to surgical procedures, -acute and chronic cholecystitis, -patients with suspected cholangitis (infectious or sclerosing cholangitis), -calculous disease (e.g. prior to laparoscopic surgery), -biliary obstruction, and -cystic biliary diseases (choledochal cyst, choledochocele, or Caroli's syndrome) Pitfalls: Pitfalls in diagnosing calculous disease are biliary prostheses, clips, aerobilia, hematobilia, and incrustations. MRCP studies should be performed prior to placement of biliary endoprostheses, because aerobilia renders MRCP assessment of bile ducts difficult. Plastic prostheses are diamagnetic and provide no signal on MR images isointense to stones or sludge. Metal stents show susceptibility artifacts depending on their structure and composition [1] [9] . Introduction MRCP visualizes the biliary fluid, the duct walls and adjacent soft-tissue structures of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary system. In contrast to ERCP, all biliary ducts and the gallbladder, which are in vivo filled with fluid, are demonstrated. MRCP uses heavily T2-w sequences with TE's longer than T2-relaxation times of soft tissue, which then do not contribute to the signal on images. This technique allows visualization of static fluid and may be considered as a fluid-weighted technique. T2-w MRI w/wo fat-suppression with moderate TE and Gd-enhanced T1-w GRE demonstrate duct wall and adjacent soft tissue structures [1] [2] [3] .",

To review percutaneous and endoscopic approach Intra-or extrahepatic biliary strictures and stones can be the result of various conditions. Biliary strictures can be the result of primary or secondary cholangitis and small stones tend to get formed above the strictures. Another common reason for extrahepatic stricture is intraoperative iatrogenic CBD injury, while multiple biliary duct confluence strictures can be the result of intraoperative thermal injury. Also, late stenosis of a bilio-digestive anastomosis can lead to similar problems. ERCP is the primary interventional imaging method for the treatment of pathological problems of this area. However, when ERCP cannot approach the bile ducts, percutaneous transhepatic approach is indicative. This can occur in the following situations : a) in shortage of specialized medical staff or ERCP equipment, b) when due to a previous operation the anatomy of the area has changed, thus making the catheterization of the biliary tree impossible, c) when extensive benign or malignant stenosis of the gastrointestinal tract at any point prior to the ampulla of Vater or a duodenal diverticulum are present, and d) when intrahepatic stones exist. These stones can either be multiple, impacted or located in isolated branches or behind stenoses. Percutaneous treatment is initiated with the performance of PTC. Its technical success rate reaches up to 98% in patients with dilated, and up to 70% in patients with non-dilated biliary tree branches. PTC-Drainage of the dilated biliary tree is the second step. Transhepatic drainage can be performed through the right or the left liver lobe. In patients with benign biliary strictures of the bile duct or the biliodigestive anastomosis, dilatation with high pressure balloons can be attempted prior to mechanical lithotripsy, followed by long-term internal drainage with large bore catheters 12-16 Fr. Lithotripsy can be fluoroscopically performed with the use of special stone retrieval baskets or special retrieval balloons. It can also be performed with the use of percutaneous cholangioscopy assisted by intracorporal electrohydraulic lithotripsy. The lithotripsy success rate is as high as 92-100%, while multiple sessions within a period of three months may be necessary.",

            "text": "Learning Objectives: 1. The role of US, CT and MR in no-dilated tract imaging 2. Technical tips and tricks for non-dilated tract puncture 3. To review current techniques and the tools available Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is an established technique for treating patients with biliary obstruction or leakage. Due to the non-invasive imaging techniques that are available nowadays such as ultrasonography, CT and MRCP, there is virtually no role for percutaneous cholangiography without drainage. PTBD in patients with non-dilated biliary ducts may be indicated in biliary obstruction after biliojejunostomy, following liver transplantation, in primary sclerosing cholangitis or primary biliary cirrhosis. In addition, drainage may be necessary in cases of iatrogenic bile duct injury and leakage. Requirements to access the non-dilated biliary tract are anatomical knowledge of liver and bile ducts and adequate pre-procedural imaging, patient preparation, per-procedural imaging and presence of specific minimal invasive materials. Anatomical variants of the biliary tree have been described by Scott Gazelle who noted that in 40% of patients there is no classic anatomy with a left and a right hepatic duct, but rather a trifurcation or drainage of either the right anterior or right posterior segmental duct into the left hepatic duct. Various anatomical variants of the cystic duct have been described by Turner and co-workers. Pre-procedural imaging is necessary to assess the cause and level of biliary obstruction or leakage and to rule out diffuse segmental obstruction in patients with liver metastases. Patient preparation includes an IV drip, prophylactic antibiotics, analgesia such as fentanyl and a sedative such as midazolam. PTBD, in general, and especially of non-dilated biliary ducts is preferentially performed with the combination of ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic guidance. In order to keep the procedure as minimal invasive as possible specific materials such as 22-Gauge Chiba needles, 0.018 inch guidewires, tapered 6F catheters, 0.035 inch hydrophilic and stiff guidewires, sheaths and hydrophilic drainage catheters should be available. Additional techniques in order to facilitate drainage of non-dilated ducts may be the administration of contrast material through T-tubes, biloma drains, gallbladder drains or nasobiliary drainage catheters. Relatively few manuscripts with small series of patients have been published of PTBD of non-dilated ducts. Conflicting results are reported regarding technical success and complication rates of PTBD of non-dilated ducts vs. dilated ducts. Most frequent complications are cholangitis, sepsis and bleeding. In conclusion, knowledge of biliary anatomy, adequate imaging, optimal patient preparation and the presence of specific minimal invasive materials may facilitate to access non-dilated biliary ducts. Although more complex intervention is occasionally recommended, ERCP with stent placement (not sphincterotomy) is the therapeutic method of choice and is virtually universally successful in closing the bile leak. The stent can be removed after six to eight weeks. Some have used nasobiliary drainage but this is intensely unpleasant for the patient and normally keeps them in hospital unnecessarily. Complications of stent placement for bile leak in this way are very low, pancreatitis in 1-3% being the most common. Any associated retained bile duct stone or biliary stricture needs treating in its own right. If endoscopic access is not possible then treatment is much more difficult as it relies upon trans-hepatic biliary drainage of a decompressed biliary system. The rationale behind treatment, the management of tricky situations and follow up will all be discussed.",

To learn how the study results and guidelines should be transferred to clinical praxis Introduction: In the last decade several prospective randomized trials were performed in Europe and the United States which compared the outcome of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Results: A meta-analysis of the data of EV-3S, SPACE, ICSS, and CREST shows a tendency in favour of CEA concerning the ipsilateral stroke rate, but not mortality rate. The stroke rate depended on the age of the patients. CAS had better results for patients younger than 70 years (CREST) resp. 65 years (SPACE), whereas CEA had a lower stroke rate in elderly patients. The trials showed an equal mortality rate, but a significantly higher incidence of myocardial infarctions, of cranial nerve palsies -1-2% of them permanent -and after-bleeding. A more thorough analysis reveals a number of shortcomings of the European trials. CAS interventionalists did not need credentialing with a sufficient number of procedures performed. Tutor-assisted procedures were accepted. We know from several sources, e.g. the German ProCAS registry, that experience with CAS is a highly significant outcome factor. Cerebral protection was not routinely used and platelet inhibition was often insufficient. Therefore, the European trials do not fulfil the criterion of \"good medical practise\". The US trials like SAPPHIRE or CREST did not permit tutor-assisted CAS and had consequently better results. We also learnt from the studies that a better patient selection would influence the outcome. CEA had a much larger number of exclusion criteria than CAS. A better balanced evaluation of both methods requires more exclusion criteria for CAS like severe elongations and ulcerative atherosclerosis of the aortic arch. The trial data were collected between 2000 and 2007, but none of them used proximal balloon protection which reduces the rate of strokes and of clinically silent diffusion impairments as revealed by MRI. New data from post-market trials have proven that the stroke and mortality rate of symptomatic patients can be kept below 5% Conclusion and teaching points by the moderator: Percutaneous transhepatic methods are useful in cases endoscopic or surgical treatment cannot help. After initial drainage, application of percutaneous lithotripsy, aided mechanically or endoscopically, is an effective method. In combination with a qualified surgical and endoscopic department, percutaneous methods constitute the necessary supplement for providing complete therapeutic services of benign biliary disease. ",

Bile leaks occur in about 1% of laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients but the incidence is higher after hepatic resection or transplantation.

            "text": "Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course methods are needed that are able to identify most -if not all -of the features of the vulnerable plaque. Although several imaging modalities, such as intravascular ultrasound (10) or computed tomography (CT) (11) , have been in use to assess atherosclerotic plaques, this lecture will show that magnetic resonance (MR) provides the unique potential to identify most of the key features of the vulnerable carotid plaque (12) . MR is non-invasive, does not involve ionizing radiation, enables the visualization of the vessel lumen and wall (13) and can be repeated serially to track progression or regression (14) . Furthermore, the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by MR enables the evaluation of compositional and morphological features of atherosclerotic plaques with good correlation to histopathology (12) . Recent studies have shown that MRI is able to differentiate symptomatic from asymptomatic plaques (15) and that certain MRI features, such as intraplaque hemorrhage or a thin/ruptured fibrous cap are associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events (16) . Furthermore, data will be presented which will show the influence of preoperative plaque morphology as assessed by in vivo MRI on the peri-procedural risk and MRI-based literature that demonstrates that non-stenosing obstructive plaques can cause thrombembolic events in the carotid arteries (17) . The potential of other non-invasive imaging techniques, such as CT, PET/CT and ultrasound will also be discussed. In summary, this lecture will focus on the potential of non-invasive imaging techniques to characterize carotid atherosclerotic plaques and will discuss the potential of the different techniques to help to select the best treatment modality for each individual patient. Conclusions: The quality of the European CAS vs. CEA trials is poor and of little help to evaluate the procedure. The benefit of symptomatic patients with CEA and now also CAS is well established. CAS can be recommended to asymptomatic patients when their life expectancy exceeds 3 years and the complication rate is lower than 3%. Ongoing studies like SPACE II and ICSS II will show within the next years if best medical treatment can compete with CAS and CEA in prevention of stroke.",

To learn when and how plaque imaging should be done and how it could influence the selection of treatment modality Traditionally, the indication for carotid interventions was based on the degree of luminal stenosis, as it has been shown that symptomatic patients with >50% stenosis and asymptomatic patients with >80% stenosis profit the most from interventions. However, numbers needed to treat to prevent one ischemic event range from 4 to 7 procedures for symptomatic and 14 to 17 procedures for asymptomatic patients (1) (2) (3) . These numbers were calculated in large cohort studies in the 90-ies based on average peri-procedural event rates between 3 and 7% with lower event rates reported for asymptomatic patients (1) (2) (3) . While peri-procedural event rates have not changed dramatically during recent years, best medical treatment has improved substantially and recent studies (4) have suggested that event rates in medically treated patients are currently much lower than they used to be. Given the large number of patients needed to treat to prevent an event, a low but substantial risk of peri-procedural events and an improvement of conservative treatment we should aim to find better criteria to identify those patients that profit most from carotid interventions. But how should we identify those patients? Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the degree of luminal stenosis is insufficient to predict a plaque's vulnerability, e.g. 60% of all myocardial infarctions occur in vessels with \u226450% stenosis (5;6) . Similarly, a prospective study published in 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine (7) which used intravascular ultrasound has shown that most non-culprit coronary lesions responsible for follow-up events were angiographically mild at baseline (mean diameter stenosis=32%). Recently, the concept of the \"vulnerable\" plaque has emerged. \"Vulnerable\" plaques are atherosclerotic plaques that have a high likelihood to cause thrombotic complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Plaques that tend to progress rapidly are also considered to be vulnerable. In order to define vulnerable plaques a classification for clinical as well as pathological evaluation of vulnerable plaques was recently put forward, which proposed 5 major and 5 minor criteria, such as (8;9) . \"Vulnerable\" plaques are atherosclerotic plaques that have a high likelihood to cause thrombotic complications, such as plaques with a thin cap and a large lipid-necrotic core, active inflammation, a fissured plaque, stenosis greater than 90%, endothelial denudation with or without superficial platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition, endothelial dysfunction, calcified nodules, intraplaque hemorrhage, glistening yellow plaques (seen at angioscopy), and outward remodeling.

According to the American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) either stereotactic radiation therapy or percutaneous thermal ablation should be offered to patients who are medically inoperable (5) . For selected patients, these technologies offer an optimal treatment option given their availability in the outpatient setting and low associated morbidity and mortality. In the category \"thermal ablation\" all energy sources that destroy a tumor with thermal energy are included, either by heat (hyperthermal ablation) which include radiofrequency (RF), laser and microwave (MW) or by cold (cryoablation or hypothermal ablation). The main objectives of pulmonary tumor ablation therapy (and other malignancies) are: 1) to eradicate all viable malignant cells in the target volume, with a safety margin to ensure complete eradication, 2) minimizing the damage to certain targeted volume will provide a good functioning reserve of the rest of the lung. This is particularly important for patient with limited pulmonary functions due to extensive underlying emphysema and fibrosis (6, 7) . The potential advantages of local tumor ablation therapy over surgical resection might include: 1) selective damage, 2) minimal treatment morbidity and mortality, 3) less breathing impairment in patients with borderline lung function through sparing healthy lung tissue, 4) repeatability, 5) fairly low costs, 6) excellent imaging during the procedure and for follow-up and last but not least, 7) the gain in quality of life with less pain, much shorter hospitalization times with the interventions performed on an outpatient base or with overnight stays and thus a quicker re-access to social life (8, 9) . Lung ablation can be a reasonable therapy even for selected patients with more advanced cancer. Such patients would include those with stage IIIb disease (based on a second nodule within the same tumor lobe) or stage IV disease based on a satellite nodule within another lobe. In addition, patients with advanced stage disease who may be treated with RF ablation include those who have responded to definitive radiation and chemotherapy but have a persistent solitary peripheral focus of cancer, and those who present with a recurrent isolated cancer after previous lung resection (10) . Percutaneous thermal ablation is generally indicated for nonsurgical patients with metastatic cancer limited pulmonary metastatic burden. Approximately 30% of patients with colorectal cancer have pulmonary metastases, and in about 2-4%, these metastases are isolated (11) . The number of lesions should not be considered an absolute contraindication to RF ablation if successful treatment of all metastatic deposits can be accomplished. Nevertheless, most centres preferentially treat patients with five or fewer lesions (12) . The target tumor should not exceed 3-3.5 cm in longest axis to achieve best rates of complete ablation with most of the currently available devices 6. Radiofrequency ablation is considered contraindicated in the presence of tumors located <1cm main bronchi and when tumors are associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis (12, 6) . Thermal injury of hilar structures must be avoided because of the risk of a severe hemopthysis (13) . In experienced hands, thermal ablation of tumors located in the vicinity of major vessels, like the aorta, and the heart has been shown to be feasible. In these cases, however, the risk of incomplete treatment of the neoplastic tissue close to the vessel may increase because of the heat loss by convection (14) . In contrast to existing thermo-ablative technologies, however, microwave treatment offers several key theoretical advantages in this and in similar situations. These include efficacy on lesions with a cystic component and/or in proximity to vascular structures >3 mm in diameter with a reduction in the heatsink effect, a larger volume of cellular necrosis, reduction in procedure times, greater temperatures delivered to the target lesion, the possibility of using multiple antennae simultaneously and less intraprocedural pain (15, 16, 17) . In addition, MWA does not require placement of grounding pads (15) . Patients with untreatable or unmanageable coagulopathy or with performance status >2 are not candidates for thermal ablation of lung tumors. The treatment is possible but at a higher risk of complication and should be performed by an experienced operator in patients that have undergone previous Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss indications and contraindications of interventional treatment 2. To analyse results of clinical trials 3. To understand the role of interventional therapies in the management of lung cancer The evolving field of pulmonary interventional oncology can be considered as a small integrative part in the complex area of oncology. The development of image-guided percutaneous techniques for local tumor ablation has been one of the major advances in the treatment of solid tumors. In patients who are deemed not to be candidates for surgery, various treatment strategies are available, including observation, conventional fractionated radiotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy and RF ablation. While it is generally accepted that observation and conventional radiotherapies offer survival rates that are inferior to the other therapeutic strategies, respectively -5-year survival rates in the range of 6-14% and 10-27% -there is no standardized, clearly established therapy to offer 401 pneumonectomy or when lesions are adjacent to major vessels or to the heart (18, 14) . Patient records, complete history, physical examination, and prior imaging studies should be evaluated to determine the indication and the feasibility of RF ablation. Biopsy should be performed before RF ablation in patients suspected to have a NSCLC, to confirm the diagnosis of cancer; however, in some highrisk patients, it is better that the patient undergo the risk of the biopsy and RF ablation in one setting (19) . In case of lung metastases, histopathologic or cytologic confirmation should be obtained whenever there is atypical presentation or very late presentation after the primary tumor (20, 21) . Pretreatment imaging must carefully define the location of each lesion with respect to surrounding structures. Lesions located near or adjacent to pleura can be treated with RF ablation, although their treatment may be associated with pleural effusion caused by pleurisy brought on by the heat conducted. However, pleural effusion is usually small in amount, asymptomatic, and thus clinically insignificant (22) . Treatment of subpleural lesions may be also more painful, and an adequate pain relief strategy must be foreseen (22, 23) . Pretreatment imaging is also aimed in evaluating the planned trajectory and the conditions of pulmonary parenchyma. In fact, it has been shown that the length of needle trajectory through aerated lung and the presence of severe emphysema represent important factors for the development of peri and postprocedural pneumothorax (22, 24) . Therefore, the electrode trajectory should be chosen to avoid fissures, to minimize the amount of aerate lung that needs to be traversed, avoid larger vessels and bullae (12) . Preprocedural laboratory tests should include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patient with colorectal lung metastases and a careful patient's coagulation status. This includes measurement of the complete blood count, including platelet count, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR). In some institutions the activated partial thromboplastin time, and/or cutaneous bleeding time are requested. An important issue surrounds management of antiplatelet (i.e., aspirin, ticlodipine, clopidogrel, IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and/or anticoagulant drugs (i.e., warfarin) before and after the time of RF ablation. Antiplatelet medications should be discontinued several to 10 days before RF ablation. Antiplatelet therapy may be restarted 48-72 h after RF ablation. Even anticoagulant medications should be discontinued prior to RF ablation. Warfarin should generally be discontinued at least 5 days prior to RF ablation. Heparin and related products should be discontinued 12-24 h prior to RF ablation. Warfarin may be restarted the day following RF ablation. Clinical and imaging findings associated with a multidisciplinary team evaluation are the most important features to obtain high clinical efficacy and to avoid complications. (2) ",

Larger tumours are usually ablated in conjunction with another therapeutic modality such as radiotherapy. Location next to >3-mm diameter blood vessels or bronchi can, but not necessarily, result in incomplete ablation. Local recurrence is higher in primary lung cancer than metastatic disease and so a larger ablative margin is recommended.

Tips and tricks in challenging cases In the treatment of primary and metastatic lung tumor by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) a wide variety of different RFA systems are used, most commonly: RITA (Angiodynamics, Queensbury, NY), LeVeen (Boston Scientific, Boston, MA) and Cool-tip (Covidien, Boulder, CO). The latter two based on tissue impedance monitoring, whereas the first based on intratumoral temperature monitoring. Also, the electrode geometry differs with RITA and LeVeen using multitined expandable and Cool-tip straight internally cooled electrodes. The use of these different systems depends on treating physician, availability and tumor localization or configuration. Comparative studies regarding clinical efficacy are still lacking. In most cases lung RFA is performed in curative intention which makes a preinterventional imaging work-up mandatory to exclude distant metastases, possibly changing the therapeutic concept. Thoraco-abdominal computer tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT are useful modalities for this intention. The same imaging modality can be used to assess the target tumor for size, location and neighboring organs, which will influence the type of anesthesia, patient positioning, access route, additional maneuvers for safe access or ablation and configuration as well as size of the electrode. At this moment CT is the most accurate imaging modality for perinterventional imaging of lung RFA. Fluoro-CT results in very fast and accurate needle placement, at the risk of higher patient an operator dose compared to conventional CT-guided puncture. The possibility for multiplanar reconstruction facilitates an almost immediate assessment of the needle position in relation to the tumor or surrounding critical structures. Ground glass opacity surrounding the ablated tumor is an immediate indicator for treatment success after ablation. After 24-48 hours the ablation zone is clear visible and thereafter shrinkage of this lesion can be expected. Different postablational imaging patterns have been described with fibrosis as the leading pattern after 12 months in tumors <2cm, whereas tumors >2cm appear as nodules in the vast majority. The challenge for the treating physician remains to identify areas of incomplete treatment. MRI either contrast enhanced or diffusion weighted, PET-CT or growth of the ablated zone seem to be the most reliable imaging methods or features for detection of incomplete ablation. Due to the possibility of late recurrence extended follow-up imaging after treatment is required. Even though a direct puncture followed by ablation of the lung tumor is feasible in most of the cases, different techniques for successful ablation of pulmonary tumors in critical location must be kept in mind. Artificial pneumothorax is a possibility to prevent thermal injury during RFA for tumors in contact with the heart, phrenic nerve or diaphragm. In selected cases artificial pneumomediastinum can be created for the same reason. Guiding needles can be used to speed up the procedure or to perform a biopsy at the same time as RFA through the same path. Anchoring of a tumor with a needle prior to puncture with the RFA electrode can be another technique to perform a safe ablation of a mobile pulmonary nodule. More sophisticated techniques like navigation devices could help in the future to create sufficiently overlapping ablations including the necessary safety margin for larger or irregular shaped lung tumors. (10). CONCLUSION Ablation is a very effective tool for the local control of small volume lung tumours. This will be a major ablation application in a range of different clinical settings.",

The reported 3-yr survival is between 30 and 54%, and the 5-yr survival is 15-40%, median survival of 12 -18 months. Nakamura et al reported on 20 patients with a mean of 7 metastases, mean size 1.4 cm. 1-and 3-yr survival were 58% and 29% overall, median 12.9 months but for the subgroup who had complete ablation of all visible disease the 1-and 3-year survival was 89% and 59% (4). Our results of RF or MW ablation of 87 sarcoma metastases in 36 patients also reflect the therapeutic intent of ablation. Ablation can be used in inoperable patients with small volume lung only disease but also in operable patients for whom surgery would be inappropriate, too invasive at that particular time-point, or would interrupt other therapy. All of our patients treated with curative intent are alive at a median of 20 months, median survival for the non-curative group was still important, although not as good, at 23 months. PRIMARY LUNG CANCER Primary lung cancer patients are much more challenging. They often carry significant medical co-morbidity which makes ablation harder. Limited respiratory reserve and repeated infective exacerbations of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonic disease turn ablation from a very benign intervention into a more significant intervention. Recurrence rates are generally higher and margins may be harder to achieve in irregular, infiltrative, invasive tumours. A larger margin is generally recommended. In support of this one analysis of 91 patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with ablation showed that recurrence was equally likely to be local or distant and therefore improved results could be anticipated with more aggressive local ablation (5). Ablation has delivered reasonable survival data in early stage lung cancer. Hiraki reported on 20 non surgical patients with stage 1 nonsmall cell and showed that the cancer-specific survival at 2 years was 93% and at 3 years 83% (6). Pennathur reported on 100 patients with significant medical co-morbidities treated with ablation who achieved a 2-year survival of 49% (7). The role of ablation relative to conventional treatment modalities is being established but more work is required. A retrospective comparison of sublobar resection, RFA and cryotherapy showed similar 3-year cancer-specific survival in all three groups (8) . Kim et al compared matched patients with stage I lung cancer who underwent RFA (n=8) and surgery (n=14) and found no difference in overall survival (9) . Ablation can be used in isolation or in conjunction with radiotherapy. It is expected that the combination will be more effective than either treatment alone. ",

To explain the role of accident and fortune in developing a new revascularization technique 3. To understand the various steps from an idea to a new technique In January 1987, a 65-year-old male patient presented with intermittent claudication of 150 meters in the left leg, which he had for over 1 year. No pedal pulses were detected and the ABPI was 0.5. A diagnostic angiogram revealed a 12-cm occlusion of the popliteal artery. During attempted crossing of the lesion, with a Teflon coated 1.5 mm J wire, a dissection occurred accidentally. There was also a small perforation in the mid popliteal artery. As the 'J' wire was pushed further, it formed a 'U' loop, which re-entered the lumen distally without any difficulty. The occlusion was dilated with a 7 French 5 mm x 4 cm balloon. Whilst cosmetically it was a poor result, showing extensive dissection and perforation, haemodynamically it appeared to be an excellent result, shown by very fast flow. The ABPI next day was 0.95, and subsequently the patient was asymptomatic in that leg. A follow-up angiogram three months later (done when the patient came to have his other leg treated) showed an excellent cosmetic and clinical result. The success of this result and subsequent 'accidental' crossings of total occlusions through dissections reinforced a view that acceptable results could be achieved through the dissection route,",

To understand the various steps from an idea to a product Very often a clinical problem and the search for a solution lead to new techniques and products. Most important factors in developments are innovative ideas, basic and applied research and availability of suitable technologies. Sometimes translation of a new idea into a new technique or product will end in a cul-de-sac. \"Trial and error\" is probably more often seen rather than \"trial and success\". A good example is the Porstmann's \"caged balloon\" in the search for an angioplasty balloon tolerating higher pressures. Theoretically, there are several potential ways to go, e.g. from an idea to a particular clinical application or from a clinical problem to a solution or from an already existing solution to a modification, improvement or extension. The right technical partner for the realization of a new device is of the utmost importance on the way to success. It is a long way from an innovative idea to a device that can be used clinically. Medical products have to be approved by the authorities in a lengthy process to assure the safety and effectiveness of a device. FDA approval in the United States of America is a prerequisite for clinical application, whereas in Europe there are EU directives regulating approval. Products are classified into low, medium and high-risk devices. The latter include, e.g. stents and caval filters. Certified medical devices will obtain a CE mark. Examples of successful stories in Interventional Radiology include, e.g. the development of balloon catheters, stents, thrombectomy devices, embolization materials and also caval filters. Caval filters have been around since the development of the Mobin-Uddin and the Greenfield filters in the late 1960s. Because of the large calibre of the introducer systems used at that time, we developed together with COOK Medical a basket filter for percutaneous introduction using a small calibre (8.5F ID) introducer sheath in 1983. Despite successful experimental testing, clinical use revealed asymptomatic fatigue fractures of the filter struts in the long-run. This prompted us to develop a new filter, the G\u00fcnther Tulip filter, which was designed for percutaneous introduction, but also percutaneous retrieval (1992). This was the first optional filter. For safety considerations, retrieval was limited initially to 10-14 days postimplantation. Later on, it turned out that filter retrieval was possible even after longer periods of time. The Tulip filter has become a successful and established protective device against pulmonary embolism world-wide. In view of the long-term sequelae of filters in general (postthrombotic syndrome), however, filter retrieval even after longer dwell-times is a desirable feature. For that purpose, we finally modified this filter by opening the loops of the Tulip leafs in order to facilitate extraction even after ingrowth of the anchoring legs into the caval wall (Celect filter/COOK). This story exemplifies the stepwise progress in filter development from a large to a small calibre device and from a permanent to a retrievable and finally optional caval filter. The key to success was to identify the clinical and technical problems and to find a safe and effective solution in close cooperation with a competent industrial partner having access to the necessary technology and the market.

Nature of modifications and procedure alterations that need to be developed to allow successful projects to be undertaken using MR focused ultrasound guidance will be briefly outlined. Projects involving fibroid ablation, liver ablation, prostate ablation, facet joint ablation, breast cancer ablation, brain tumour ablation and opening up of the blood brain barrier and functional neurosurgery done noninvasively will be mentioned to illustrate these points. The overall scope of MR intervention is very wide and only limited areas can be effectively mentioned in such a brief description. The current state of the machine technology with wider bore shorter magnets that allow some degree of access whilst maintaining high image quality will be discussed. In previous more open magnet manifestations which allowed greater access to patients during MR scanning quality was always compromised because the tradeoffs made to allow the open environment usually meant that field strength and gradient strength were significantly reduced resulting in relatively poor quality very fast near real-time MR images. The current crop of wider bore 1.5 Tesla scanners hold out the opportunity of carrying out high-quality imaging with some degree of patient access to allow these procedures to be done. The future for MR intervention therefore lies between higher quality wider bore scanners allowing some instrumentation to patients in a less closed environment than a conventional MR scanner and the subsequently called subintimal angioplasty. The success in the femoropopliteal segment was extended to other areas such as tibial, profunda, brachial, subclavian, iliac and even superior mesenteric arteries. The standard Teflon coated 'J' wire in 1990 was superseded by hydrophilic curved and subsequently the 1.5 mm 'J' wires for crossing femoropopliteal and tibial occlusions. The introduction of a 'Bolia minicath' has transformed the treatment of flush SFA occlusions. The standard retrograde approach for iliac occlusive disease, especially the common Iliac artery invariably results into a dissection and subsequent difficulties to achieve re-entry into the proximal segment (aorta). This has prompted the development of the outback catheter (Cordis J&J), now commonly used in common iliac occlusive disease. The technique has had major impact on the treatment of occlusive disease, particularly in challenging situations like flush superficial artery occlusions, long tibial occlusions, bifurcation occlusion of common femoral artery and trifurcation occlusions extending into all the run off vessels. Without subintimal angioplasty, these situations would be very difficult to treat endovascularly. The technique has had the most impact on patients with critical limb ischaemia, achieving limb salvage rates of near 90% and in many of these cases, surgery would not be applicable. For intermittent claudication, promising results have been demonstrated, but still probably do not match the results of bypass surgery, especially when a vein is used. Best results for subintimal angioplasty are obtained when patients are entered into a surveillance programme, so that stenosis can be treated before it becomes an occlusion, thus improving secondary patency. The technique is also used for crossing total occlusions before implanting a bare metal stent (BMS), drug eluting stent (DES), or a covered stent, otherwise called endolining. It has also been suggested that a drug eluting balloon (DEB) may have favourable outcomes. ",

Five parameters of venous drainage anomaly (\"CCSVI criteria\") were postulated by transcranial and extracranial color-coded duplexsonography (ECCS) and a perfect overlap of impaired extracranial cerebral venous outflow with an MS diagnosis was reported. These findings caused exorbitant interest among scientists and clinicians, in patient support groups, and the non-medical media. However, further studies applying various techniques such as sonography, magnetic resonance angiography and selective venography failed to reproduce or to support the CCSVI hypothesis. Nevertheless, endovascular treatments are increasingly being performed outside clinical trials, misleading MS patients to believe that these procedures are harmless while a proof of this and of a clinical benefit is lacking. The presentation summarizes the data published so far regarding the \"CCSVI\" hypothesis and presents a critical analysis of the original \"CCSVI\" criteria under special consideration of the cerebrocervical venous anatomy and hemodynamic. Furthermore, the findings from our own studies, which argue against a causal relationship between venous congestion and MS, will be discussed in detail:",

None of the criteria in Ideal document is applicable to the current introduction and promotion of treatment of an anatomical variation, by some called CCSVI, to improve patients with MS. Invasive therapies are complex interventions, the assessment of which is challenged by factors that depend on operator, team, and setting, such as learning curves, quality variations, and perception of equipoise. In the ideal paper recommendations are made for the assessment new interventions based on a five-stage description of the development process. They also encourage a widespread use of prospective databases and registries. Reports of new techniques should be registered as a professional duty, anonymously if necessary when outcomes are adverse. Case series studies should be replaced by Prospective (and no case series) development studies should be done for early technical modifications and by prospective development of MR-guided focused ultrasound. The potential therefore for the descendants of the initial MR-guided technological developments is intervention so minimal that there is no breach through the skin but rather all procedures are carried out as closed image-guided procedures requiring the minimum of hospitalisation and maximising the rapidity of patients return to normal activities and work often within one-day post-procedure therefore allowing maximum cost benefit for such a procedure despite the utilisation of machinery that has a higher initial capital cost.

It affects mostly young adults, females more than males. Symptoms are due to localized inflammatory lesions in the cerebral and spinal white matter that occur at disseminated locations and times. Diagnosis is based on the clinical course, signs and symptoms, MR-imaging, and typical CSF findings. Most patients experience episodic deteriorations or discrete attacks (relapsing-remitting course), although symptoms can also develop in a slowly progressive manner (primary or secondary progressive course). Symptoms and signs depend on the location of the cerebral lesions and may include visual loss, weakness, motor control, sensory disturbance, or cognitive functions. The degree of disability is usually measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Strong evidence suggests that both T-and B-lymphocytes contribute to the inflammatory process resulting in later axonal loss and atrophy of the brain. The inflammatory and autoimmune pathogenesis is further supported by the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory compounds used in the treatment of the disease. Although there is no cure, very effective disease modifying drugs are available; such as interferons, gatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, and a number of recently approved oral drugs. Furthermore, monoclonal humanized antibodies that deplete specific subgroups of lymphoctes such as alemtuzumab (antibody against CD52 lymphocytes) or daclizumab (interleukin receptor CD25) seem to have very strong effects on the disease activity and the disability. However, genetic (polygenetic) predisposition and environmental factors (anteceding infection) might influence the occurrence of the disease.",

In the U.K., for example, vascular surgeons and neurologists have been driving research in EVAR and carotid stenting respectively. IR is obviously involved in this research but all too often in a facilitatory rather than leadership role. We should not despair, although there is still much to be done. Knowledge gaps in IR can make you gasp; for example where is the evidence that embolisation stops haemorrhage and saves lives? We all think it stops bleeding, but is it more effective than surgery? Is prophylactic embolisation for high risk pregnancy effective? Is emergency EVAR superior to open surgery for ruptured aneurysms? Is aspirin as good as a carotid stent? Do drug eluting stents reduce amputation rates in diabetics? I could go on. There will be those who say they know an IR procedure works and seek no further reassurance, that trials can`t be done, or are unethical. Open your eyes: some of these difficult trials are already underway and others are in an embryonic form. We should not shy away from evidence-based IR but embrace it; we need to be comfortable with uncertainty and equipoise and share it with our patients. After all, you can only persuade a patient to participate in a clinical trial if you are comfortable that you personally do not know the answer to the question being asked. The world has moved on since the halcyon days when interventional radiology \"rode on the crest of a wave\". Healthcare costs have rocketed and together with an aging population countries and governments struggle to contain costs. We need to prove that what we do is effective, safe, superior and more cost-effective than the alternative therapy. Regulatory control of medicine in only going to become increasingly robust. Fortunately there are increasing numbers of clinical trials progressing in IR, within the vascular, non-vascular and oncological fields.

To portray patient management prior to vertebroplasty It is a fact that 80% of the European population will experience at some point in their life an incidence of back pain. Part of the back pain incidence is attributed to vertebral fractures. As minimal interventional procedures are gaining momentum in musculoskeletal interventional pain procedures, clinical evaluation of patients with back pain becomes a necessity, prior to treatment. The interventional radiologist involved in pain management, specifically with vertebral augmentation and peripheral osteoplasty, should not only be able to interpret imaging findings but also be able to correlate those to clinical findings and establish a comprehensive patient treatment. In this course we will try to analyze the imaging characteristics relative to vertebral fractures and integrate them to the clinical tests that will increase the level of certitude for a successful treatment. Part of the course will be to develop algorithms that will include the whole armamentarium of interventional pain procedures and their relation to each other in order to establish faster pain control and research databases for later pre-trial evaluation. Protocols for these studies should be registered publicly. Statistical process control techniques can be useful in both early and late assessment. Randomised trials should be used whenever possible to investigate efficacy, but adequate pre-trial data are essential to allow power calculations, clarify the definition and indications of the intervention, and develop quality measures. Alternative prospective designs, such as interrupted time series studies, should be used when randomised trials are not feasible. Established procedures should be monitored with prospective databases to analyse outcome variations and to identify late and rare events. Achievement of improved design, conduct, and reporting of new intervention research will need concerted action by editors, funders of health care and research, regulatory bodies, and professional societies.

            "text": "\"Not how but if and when\" was my original title for this lecture but it was suggested by the CIRSE office that a clearer title might be more useful. Therefore I have added \"evidence-based interventional radiology\", easily understood by all but perhaps practised by a minority? Harsh words perhaps but now is the time for interventional radiologists to reflect on their practice and indeed the practice of the entire specialty. \"Not how but if and when\" means what it says. As a heavily technique-based specialty we now need to move on to a higher level of understanding and practice. \"Should I be doing this procedure (e.g. venoplasty on this patient with multiple sclerosis)? And if so when? Should I be doing vertebroplasty, carotid stenting, EVAR and renal stenting on my patient?\" These are easily understood questions, but are much more challenging to answer. Clearly we need to know how to perform procedures safely within agreed standards. With constant technological advances in IR it's easy to see how the \"how to do it\" mentality has become a major focus or even obsession for all of us. Traditionally seen as a non-bedholding specialty, many expect us to simply carry out the requested procedure without any further consultation. In a busy work environment it is often easier and quicker to \"do it\" rather than \"question it\", rather like an ultrasound request. One important difference, however, is that an unnecessary ultrasound scan is unlikely to do any harm, whereas an inappropriate IR procedure carries the risk of morbidity and occasional mortality. Surgeons learnt this many years ago: good surgeons know how to operate, the very best surgeons know when not to. We interventional radiologists also need to wake up to this. So how do we decide whether a procedure is appropriate for a patient? In the past this was done by anecdote or, in other words, based on our individual experience; \"the last iliac angioplasty did well so I`m going to do it again.\" Far better though to make that decision based on the accumulated experience of many interventional radiologists who have seen tens-of-thousands of patients, rather than just one. These are the roots of evidence-based medicine. Interventional radiology is very fertile ground for evidence-based Munich 2011",

Difference between groups in reduction of mean VAS score from baseline was 2.6 (1 month-p<0.0001) and 2.0 (1 year-p<0.0001) [13] . These favorable clinical outcomes were supposed to be inducted by placebo effect by two studies published in NEJM [14; 15] . This is different from what others published trials described [11; 16] if correct indications are respected. Another issue against vertebral augmentation is the increased risk of a new vertebral fracture [17] [18] [19] [20] . In our personal experience of 3105 patients (2041 osteoporotic), pain relief was achieved in 2987 patients (96,2%): average VAS of 7,9\u00b11,6 significantly dropped to 1,2\u00b11,7 (p<0.0001); a new symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral collapse occurred in 262 (12,8%) osteoporotic patients. Among 2223 patients that wore the external brace, 2043 did not longer use it after. These results convinced us that NEJM \"placebo effect\" is probably due different patients' selection criteria. Future developments include vertebral stenting [21] and biological bone cement [22; 23] ; they are aimed to improve vertebral height restoration achieved by kyphoplasty and to optimize cement integration within the cancellous bone stimulating bone formation and ingrowth allowing, in the future, a prophylactic vertebral augmentation in osteoporotic patients with an high-risk of vertebral collapse and enlarging indications to young patients with trauma. We will analyse indications for bone biopsy, cement augmentation, radiofrequency ablation, focus ultrasound and their respective roles to medical treatment and radiotherapy.

            "text": "Department of Radiology, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital, London, United Kingdom. [1] . Spine is a common site of cancer metastatic spreading, with 50%-80% of patients presenting with spinal lesions during their disease [2] . These fractures cause pain, disability, diminished quality of life, decreased survival [3] , an increased risk of future vertebral fractures in osteoporosis [4] and poor clinical conditions in malignancy. Vertebrae can heal with nonsurgical management that includes analgesia, radio-chemotherapy, C RSE In order to answer this question both the efficacy and the possible limitations of drug eluting balloons have to be considered. The current basis for this is the data of the Thunder-and FemPac trials done with the Paccocath-Cotavance Catheter (Medrad) and the Levant One Trial with the Lutonix catheter. In addition there are some anecdotal information from drug eluting balloons available which have CE marc and which are used in the daily practise in Europe -mainly the Medtronic Invatec catheters for both the SFA and BTK indication. The current trials have shown that drug eluting balloons in lesions with a mean length of around 8 cm can significantly reduce the restenosis rates compared to non-drug-eluting balloons. Different coatings have shown to be safe and effective -even it has to stated that is most likely that despite the same drug (paclitaxel) and the same amount on the balloon surface the efficacy of the balloons differ. At the end the total amount of drug delivered to the arterial wall drives the long-term clinical outcome. This amount is dependent on the way the drug is adsorbed to the balloon. On possible limitation of drug eluting balloons could be that the effect in prevention of restenosis is limited to a certain time, only resulting in a catch up of restenosis in longer follow-up. At least this is not true for the Paccocath-Cotavance catheter where data are available until two-year follow-up. It has to be stated that the current data with DEBs are limited to more easy lesions which are not too long and which show not too much calcification. At least in our daily practise we could show that severe calcifications of the vessel wall are limitations for drug eluting balloons. This might overcome by atherectomy prior to the use of DEBs, nevertheless data are currently lacking. In addition, it is currently unclear of DEB together with self-expanding nitinol stents work. It might be that the chronic outward force of these stents might not be sufficiently addressed by the short time application of drugs. In summary, the DEB technology is just in the early phase. It is most likely the early enthusiasm about this technology will be overcome by the notice that there are also some limitations of this technology. These limitations might be overcome by additional technologies like atherectomy in order to prepare the vessel wall for better drug uptake. In general, the DEB technology has also to be evaluated compared to other new technologies like the drug eluting stents. In the future we will learn much more about the indication of the different technologies based on the lesions characteristics. In addition, it is not likely that all lesions will require the same amount of drug. In more complicated lesions or lesions with a higher likelihood of restenosis like in-stent restenosis or lesions in diabetic patients only a higher dose might be effective. On the other hand, higher dose might be followed be side-effects like aneurysms. Nevertheless, there are currently no clinical data that doubling the dose results in effects like this. In the Thunder trial the overlapping zone of DEBs was analysed -no undesired effects were noted.

When compared to the patency rate for an identical bare stent platform studied in the ABSOLUTE trial (51 patients with a comparable mean lesion length of 13.2 cm) there was no major difference at one year, with a 63% patency in the bare stent group. The third and final drug-eluting stent platform evaluated in SFA lesions is the Zilver PTX, combination of a self-expanding nitinol stent, Zilver, and the drug paclitaxel, applied as a coating to the stent without use of a polymer or binder. The dose of paclitaxel is 3 ug/mm. Two clinical studies of this drug-eluting stent have been performed: a single arm study of 787 patients in Europe, Canada and Korea, and a randomized trial of 474 patients in the United States, Japan and Germany. In total over 1000 patients and 2000 stents were evaluated. The randomized study had a unique trial design which employed a primary randomization of patients to PTA or Zilver PTX. The mean lesion length in these patients was 6.6 cm and 27% of the SFA lesions were occlusions. In those patients who experienced an on-table failure of PTA based on pre-specified criteria, a secondary randomization occurred. In these patients with PTA failure, they went on to receive either a Zilver PTX stent or an identical bare Zilver stent. In this trial, 50% of the initial PTA procedure were sub-optimal and thus, in this group of failed PTA patients, 59 patients had bare Zilver stent implantation and 61 had Zilver PTX stent placement after secondary randomization. At 12 and 24 months the patency rates for the Zilver PTX group versus the group that experienced a successful PTA were significantly different at both time intervals (P<0.01, P=0.029). The Zilver PTX group patency was 83.1% and 74.8% versus 64.5% and 57.8% in the successful PTA group. Perhaps, more interesting are the results of the secondary randomization groups for those patients who experienced an immediate PTA failure. At 12 and 24 months the patency rates for secondary Zilver PTX were 89.9% and 81.2% and for secondary bare Zilver were 73.0% and 62.7%. At both time intervals, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.01 at both points). The difference in 24-month re-stenosis represents a 50% reduction in the re-stenosis rate with Zilver PTX versus bare Zilver. It is important to note that the mean lesion length in the randomized trial was relatively short and although the maximum lesion length permitted for enrollment was dictated by the regulatory bodies overseeing the study, the results beg for investigation of longer, more real world lesions. The Zilver PTX Single Arm study did enroll essentially all-comers with SFA disease, including 20% with in-stent re-stenosis. The mean lesion length in this group was just over 10.0 cm. It turns out that the results are quite complementary with the randomized trial data. Overall, the TLR rates for patients with Zilver PTX stents at 12 and 24 months are 91.1% and 84.3% in the single arm study experience and 91.1% and 86.5% in the randomized trial. When a subgroup of patients with long lesions form the Zilver PTX Single arm study is evaluated, it is possible to assess the potential benefit of paclitaxel-eluting stents in extensive SFA disease. Out of the total number of lesions treated (n=900), 133 had a de novo lesion with a length greater than 15 cm. The mean lesion length in this subgroup was 22.6 cm. 83% of these lesions were total occlusions. The patency rates for these long lesions at 12 and 24 months were 94.3% and 77.0%, respectively. The future for drug-eluting stents for the management of long SFA lesions is unknown. The results to date have been mixed with no sustained difference from bare metal stent patency rates with permanent polymer-based, limus drug coatings (SIROCCO and STRIDES) and a significant reduction in restensis over bare metal stents with a paclitaxel coating and no polymer (Zilver PTX). Other factors to consider during future evaluations of drug-eluting stent programs in th SFA include: stent fracture rates (20% in SIROCCO, 0.9% Zilver PTX-randomized trial, 1.5% Zilver PTX-sArm study, etc.), the effect of the polymer formulation used in the device (permanent polymer, bio-degradable polymer, no polymer), the patterns of restenosis observed (initial experience indicates that drug-eluting stents share",

            "text": "The use of drug-eluting stents for the management of long segment peripheral arterial occlusive disease involving the superficial femoral artery (SFA) has been a topic of great interest over the last decade. In an effort to address the limitations of percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA), bare metal stent placement and a number of other endovascular devices (atherectomy, laser, cryoplasty, etc.), enthusiastic attempts to translate the benefits of drug-eluting stent technology applied with success in the coronary circulation to peripheral arteries have met with mixed results. Clearly, the well-documented frequencies of re-stenosis following PTA (12-month patency rates of 35% to 45%) and bare metal stenting (12-month patency rates of 60% to 70%) compromise the long-term patency and clinical benefits of these procedures. The success of both of these established endovascular therapies are closely related to the length of the diseased segment treated. In other words, failure is directly proportional to lesion length. The initiation of drug and device combination therapy with the development of self-expanding drug-eluting stents for the SFA is an approach designed to provide a physical/mechanical scaffolding to support the artery against the effects of recoil, dissection flaps, etc., that are likely to occur when treating a long (>10 cm) lesion, while delivering a pharmacological agent directed at preventing smooth muscle cell proliferation, intimal hyperplasia and resultant re-stenosis in response to the intervention. In this regard, to date three trials of drug-eluting stents in the SFA are worthy of discussion. The first study performed in this area is the SIROCCO trial, a doubleblind, randomized, prospective feasibility trial in the SFA. 36 patients were enrolled and randomized. The mean lesion length was 8.5 cm and 57% of the SFA lesions were occlusions. The primary effectiveness end-point was in-stent percent mean diameter stenosis determined by quantitative angiography follow-up at six months. The stent used was the SMART stent and the drug was sirolimus (dose: 140ug/cm). A permanent polymer in two formulations (slow and fast release kinetics) was employed to bind the drug to the stent. At 6 months, the mean % diameter stenosis was 22.6% in the sirolimuseluting stent group and 30.9% in the bare stent group. The in-stent mean lumen diameter was significantly larger in the drug-eluting stent group (4.95 mm versus 4.31 mm, P=0.047) and the binary instent re-stenosis was 0% in the sirolimus-eluting stent group and 17.6% in the uncoated stent group. At 18 months follow-up, the restenosis rates were no different between the two groups; however, all of the restenosis observed in the sirolimus-eluting stent group occurred in the devices that included a fast-release polymer formulation. Patients who had devices with a slow-release kinetic formulation had no re-stenosis. Subsequently, a second phase of the trial was initiated (SIROCCO II) that used only the slow-release polymer formulation. At 24 months, pooled data from the SIROCCO I (slowrelease formulation only) and II phases in 93 patients (47 received the sirolimus-eluting stent and 46 the bare SMART stent) showed no difference in the re-stenosis rates. The average lesion length was 8.3 cm. The re-stenosis rate in the sirolimus group was 22.9% versus 21.1% in the bare stent group (P>0.05). The target lesion re-vascularization rates (TLR) was 6% (sirolimus-eluting stent group) and 13% (bare stent group). The second trial that merits attention is the STRIDES single arm study that investigated the Dynalink-E drug-eluting stent, a combination of a self-expanding nitinol stent, Dynalink, coated with a permanent polymer impregnated with everolimus. Everolimus is similar in structure and action to many of the drugs in the limus family, like sirolimus. The EVAL polymer used in the formulation was designed to provide 80% elution of the drug by three months, a prolonged timeframe for release that is slower than that studied in SIROCCO. 106 patients were enrolled. 91% of the lesions were de novo and 9% re-stenotic (no in-stent restenosis). The mean lesion length was 9.0 cm and 45% of the lesions were occlusions. The promary patency at 6 months was 94.1%; however, this fell markedly to 68.5% at 12 months. The corresponding rates for TLR at 6 and 12 months were 411 C RSE",

In the general US population a PAD prevalence of 14.5% were found in those aged 70 years or older (1) . Symptoms of PAD were reported either as intermittent claudication in the legs in 10-35% or as rest pain or tissue loss in 1-3% (2) . The superficial femoral artery (SFA), and particularly long occlusions in the SFA, is one of the most controversial areas of revascularization. Comparing randomized stent studies (ABSOLUTE, RESILIENT) an association between lesion length and restenosis rates might be assumed (3, 4) . To overcome the tissue infiltration and intimal hyperplasia that can lead to in-stent restenosis, covered stents were developed for the treatment of infrainguinal lesions. Since 2000 several studies evaluated the ePTFE covered Hemobahn/ Viabahn stent-grafts for mainly long SFA stenosis and occlusions. In a multicenter nonrandomized trial, Lammer et al. reported on 80 SFA lesions treated with the Hemobahn stent-graft. The mean stented length was 13.1 cm (range, 5-40 cm). Deployment of endoprosthesis was technically successful in all patients. An early thrombosis, within 30 days, occurred in 4 (3.8%) patients.

Devices that require preliminary recanalisation with a guide wire. These devices are all designed with the aim to debulk the plaque using different approaches. Therefore, they can all be qualified as atherectomy devices. Silver Hawk Plaque Excision System (EV 3) is a device used to remove plaque that blocks arteries and interrupts blood flow instead of compressing it against the vessel wall like angioplasty or stenting. It consists of a flexible, smooth-coated shaft with a cutting unit on the distal end, containing a rotating blade in a conical, tapered housing (6 cm in length) with a lateral window. The proximal end of the catheter, which has a locking mechanism, connects to a disposable, battery-operated electric motor. For the SFA treatment it requires a 7/8 Fr. introducer sheath. The key problem is that it needs that a guidewire cross intraluminaly the lesion, in long SFA occlusions it can be difficult but in short and no calcified occlusions is feasible, other application could be in long tandem stenosis/occlusions. The company also manufactures the TurboHawk, it is useful to perform atherectomy on calcified vessels, it requires 7/8 Fr introducer sheath. Briefly, the guidewire is passed through the lesion, the device is pressed against the plaque by a specific bending mechanisms with a handle, the rotator is activated and the blade is passed several times retrograde. After a few passes, the device is removed and the plaque that has been captured into the specific reservoir is extracted. Usually, the intervention takes several minutes to be successful but can effectively remove relatively large amount of lesion. It can be a valuable tool for eccentric stenosis at the level of the common femoral or popliteal artery. The fullest data resource on use of the SilverHawk device is the observational non-randomized. Treating peripherals with Silver-Hawk: Outcomes Collection (TALON) Registry, involving investigators from 19 different centers. 601 consecutive patients with 1258 symptomatic lower extremity atherosclerotic lesions treated by plaque excision with the SilverHawk catheter. Mean lesion lengths above and below the knee, respectively, were 62.5+/-68.5 mm. placement following plaque excision occurred in only 6.3% of lesions. The 6-and 12-month rates of survival free of TLR were 90% and 80%, respectively. Diamondback 360\u00b0 Orbital Atherectomy System employs an eccentrically mounted, diamond-coated crown that rotates at high speed to sand away plaque as it slowly advances through narrowed or occluded arterial sections. The faster the crown rotates, the wider the orbit, which creates a larger lumen. Few studies are available regarding the Diamondback 360\u00b0 and patency data for this device are still undefined, it is compatible with calcified lesions and the mean debris diameter created has a 1.9 \u03bcm size. There are no data in literature regarding the patency rate, it seems that this device has a higher embolization rate compared with angioplasty or angioplasty + stent alone. Pathway PV Atherectomy System when rotating the excised material is aspirated via ports in the fluted tip into the catheter lumen and transported to a collection bag located on the device console. One study on the Pathway PV Atherectomy System is in the literature, 172 patients were treated, the device success was 99%, the 1-year restenosis rate was 38.2% based on duplex imaging. It appears to be safe and effective even in the presence of challenging lesion conditions. Auth Rotablator is one of the first rotation excision devices. It can perform atherectomy when it is not possible to cross a lesion with a balloon or to inflate a balloon especially in calcified concentric heavy calcifications. The Rotablator is a high speed (150.000 -180.000 rpm) air driven, end drilling, irrigated system. The optimal burrs size for SFA is 3 mm and requires a 9 Fr. introducer sheath. The system is compatible with a 0.009\" guidewire that needs to",

To learn about the possible indications for these techniques in clinical routine Treatment of the patient with symptomatic femoro-popliteal (FP) atherosclerotic disease is continuously evolving. Peripheral arterial chronic disease (PAD) of the lower extremities remains one of the often unrecognized manifestations of systemic arteriosclerosis symptomatically affecting between 3% and 7% of the population and up to one in five patients older than 75 years of age. Standard tools for endovascular treatment of FP steno-occlusions remain balloons and bare metallic stents. Because of numerous unmet needs, especially the challenge of long chronic occlusions, many new devices appear on the market and often operators are not always able to understand the real benefit. In the recent years, debulking techniques and excimer laser have been proposed as alternative techniques to achieve recanalization. The operator should keep in mind that sub-intimal angioplasty is a major tool that all interventional radiology (IR) should master. It has opened new frontiers in terms of lesion length, well beyond the TASC 2 recommendations, especially in the setting of critical limb ischemia (CLI). We will analyse and give the technical features of the most common debulking devices; the laser systems and the cryoplasty devices available. Roughly, there are 2 categories of recanalization/debulking device: those that need a guidewire cross the lesion and devices that do not require a guidewire to cross the lesion. Devices designed to facilitate recanalization: These devices (laser and Crosser) are designed to cross the occlusion intraluminally. Laser excimer laser (Spectranetics) may facilitate to treat complete occlusions or long stenoses, it can recanalyze a vessel without the support of a previously passed guidewire and is designed to remain into the true lumen. It is a Xe-Cl laser with a wavelength of 308 nm and a catheter output fluence of 30-80 mJ/mm\u00b2. The duration of the laser pulse is 135ns. The laser gives 3 combined effects on atheramous/fibrous lesion: photochemical, photothermal and photomechanical. The combination of those 3 effects can permit to achieve intraluminal recanalization Different devices are available: over the wire (optical fiber of 0.9-2.5 mm) and rapid exchange (optical fibers of 0.9-2.0 mm) with a introducer shaft of 4 F to 8 F. In long SFA occlusions a 90.5% immediate success rate by primarily utilizing the step-by-step procedure has been reported as well as a 1-year assisted primary and secondary patency rates of 65.1% and 75.9%, respectively. Complications such as perforation and distal embolization have been reported. Very calcified lesions can lead to cases of perforation. Crosser (Flow Cardia) The crosser device consists of a re-usable electronic Generator, highfrequency Transducer and single-use CROSSER CTO Recanalization Catheter. The generator and transducer produce high frequency mechanical vibrations (20 kHz) which are propagated through a Nitinol core wire to the metal tip of the CROSSER Catheter. The nitinol core wire transmits the vibrational energy to the metal tip of the catheter. The high frequency mechanical vibration facilitates guidewire passage of the CTO and allows for subsequent angioplasty.",

All patients were stage 1C clinically. Four patients had one tumour focus and 3 patients had two tumour foci. All tumour foci detected were of Gleason score 3+3. Pre-procedure multi-parametric MRI with DCE-MRI and DW-MRI showed tumour focus in only one patient that correlated to the mapping biopsy The rest of the positive biopsy lesions were not confidently identifiable on multi-parametric MR. The pre-procedure PSA values ranged from 2.2 to 8.5. 6 patients underwent the procedure under regional anaesthesia and one patient under general anaesthesia. The median pre-procedure preparation time in the MRI room was 105 minutes (range 60 to 200 min). The median treatment/sonication time was 125 min (range 60-155 min). Number of macrosonications delivered range from 8 to 16. The post-treatment contrastenhanced MRI demonstrated the desired non-perfused areas corresponding to the treatment plan and treated non-perfused volume (NPV) ranged from 9.7 to 12.5cc. Five patients had transurethral urinary catheter and two patients had suprapubic urinary catheters inserted prior to procedure. All patients experienced only minimal discomfort after treatment and voided normally after an overnight cross the lesion. The Auth Rotablator device has an immediate success rates of 72% to 94%. Patencies reported at 1 and 2 years are dismal, ranging from 31% to 61% and from 12% to 18%, respectively. Significant complications are associated with the device, including thrombosis, arterial spasm, hemoglobinuria, hematoma, and embolization. Late restenosis and reocclusion are also significant limiting factors of the Auth Rotablator. This device currently has limited applications for treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. As a complement of these tools, cryoplasty is proposed to increase patency rate and reduce post-angioplasty dissection. Cryoplasty: The cryoplasty device is based on traditional balloon angioplasty technology but has been modified to incorporate nitrous oxide as the inflation medium instead of the standard mixture of saline solution and contrast medium. To achieve the target temperature of -10\u00b0C at the interface of the inflated balloon and the vessel wall. Cellular necrosis (and consequent inflammation) does not occur until temperatures reach the range of -20\u00b0C. It requires 6 Fr introducer sheath. Many studies have been carried and we can asses that the cryoplasty showed good immediate success rates (74%) with lower stent placement rates compared with angioplasty alone (non-randomized studies). The long-term lesion patency rate at 6 months was 59.4%, with rates of 55.9, 52.6, and 49.1% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Conclusion: All these devices are proposed as alternative techniques for recanalization in order to achieve a higher patency rate, lower dissection rate, avoid the stent in-stent technique and cross heavy calcification zones while remaining in the true lumen. Therefore, they can have a role in selected patients and in selected anatomies. The extensive use of these devices is not recommended for long SFA occlusions but can be useful for complex anatomies, stent occlusions and heavy calcifications.",

            "text": "Today, a new opportunity exists. The promise of treating breast cancer without surgery is real. Percutaneous image-guided ablation procedures have now been employed to safely and effectively treat cancer. These procedures are now widely accepted treatment options worldwide for cancers of the lung, liver, kidney, prostate and bone. It is a logical progression to apply the techniques of percutaneous image-guided cancer ablation to treat breast cancer. To date, more than 35 studies have been published or presented worldwide on the topic of breast cancer ablation. The majority of these are feasibility studies, and what were titled as phase I and phase II trials. One of the first studies published in 2003 by Wu F et al from China used high-intensity focused ultrasound to treat a total of 48 women with T 1-2 breast cancer followed by mastectomy. This showed that the tumors could be treated and the technique was safe and feasible in ablating the breast cancers. In 2005, Noguchi M et al from Japan reported treating 10 patients with a mean tumor size of 1.1cm with radiofrequency ablation followed by surgical excision. Histological evaluation of the specimens yielded no viable tumor cells in the areas treated with ablation. Susini T. et al from Italy reported a pilot study in 2007 in which they treated 3 patients deemed elderly and inoperable with ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation and no surgical resection. The tumor sizes were from 10 to 13mm. 18-month follow up showed no tumor recurrence. In 2008, a phase II trial was reported by Medina-Franco H. et al from Mexico. They treated 25 patients with ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation. Fourteen tumors were less than 2cm and eleven tumors between 2 and 3.8cm. Following surgical excision it was found that 13 of the 14 smaller tumors were effectively ablated yet only 6 of the 11 tumors greater than 2cm were effectively treated. The authors suggest that RFA is promising in treating small breast carcinomas. Finally in 2009, Littrup PJ et al from the United States published results of their work with cryoablation in JVIR. They treated 22 breast cancer foci in 11 patients who refused surgical excision. 6 patients were treated with ultrasound guidance and 5 with combined ultrasound and computed tomography. Breast tumor size ranged from 5mm to 5.8cm. Biopsies were performed at the margins following ablation and yielded no viable tumor. No local recurrences have been reported in his cohort after 18 months of follow up. In addition to the decreased morbidity and improved cosmesis derived from minimally invasive percutaneous breast cancer ablation, there may be an added benefit. Lu P et al from China published data in 2009 describing an increased number of activated tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes in women who had their cancers ablated with high intensity focused ultrasound prior to surgery versus a control group who was not ablated. This limited research in 23 patients suggests the possibility that ablation may trigger the body's immune response against the antigen created during ablation therapy. Thus, in theory, the body may be able to produce anti-tumor antibody following ablation which may prove protective against future recurrence or metastasis. It is clear from the research being performed that there is a worldwide interest in the possibility of using percutaneous image-guided ablation in the treatment of breast cancer. It has also been documented that small tumors, lesions up to 2cm in diameter, can be effectively ablated using imaging guidance and percutaneous cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation. It is therefore a logical conclusion that percutaneous image-guided ablation of small breast cancers can and should be used to treat patients as an alternative to surgical resection. What is also clear is that what is now needed are worldwide multi-center trials on larger cohorts of patients to validate the adequacy of ablation of small cancers as a primary treatment option. There must also be, as part of these studies, an adequate way to document effective tumor ablation without surgical resection whether it be through post-ablation biopsy at the margins or follow up breast MRI or something else. Finally, this research should be carried out by physicians who are well qualified in performing image-guided interventions and accurate placement of stay with an indwelling catheter. No complications were observed. The one-month follow-up MRI showed the no significant change in NPV within the prostate in 6 patients, with slight decrease in nonperfused volume in one patient. 6/7 patients showed a decrease in serum PSA values one month after treatment. One patient had a transient increase in serum PSA one month after treatment but showed decrease below baseline three months after treatment. Per protocol patients are expected to undergo repeat MR imaging and repeat biopsy at 6 and 24 months. The 6-month biopsy of the first patient returned negative. Conclusions: So far the safety of the treatment is demonstrated with 7 patients experiencing minimal morbidity. Initial efficacy demonstrated by the non-perfusion on contrast-enhanced MRI that persist at one month after treatment and will be further confirmed by repeat mapping biopsy, serum PSA and multiparametric MRI 6 and 24 months after treatment. The device appears to deliver safe and accurate focal therapy to the prostate with minimal side effects. The longer term outcome of these low risk patients will depend on the biology of the disease. They will be under close surveillance with repeat biopsies. The failure of focal therapy should be defined as escalation of treatment to radical surgery or radiation. The goals of focal therapy is to preserve quality of life while ablating the focal index tumour.",

To present results of preclinical, phase I and phase II studies Breast cancer is a global epidemic. There were 1.38 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide in 2008. In the European Union (EU 27) there were 332,000 new breast cancers in 2008. In Asia, the rate of breast cancer is increasing dramatically and will likely reach that of Western nations in the next 10 to 20 years. Great strides have been made recently in the field of breast cancer detection. The widespread implementation of digital mammography and high resolution breast ultrasound and MRI has made finding smaller and earlier stage breast cancers more likely than ever before. New and future imaging modalities such as breast tomosynthesis, automated whole breast ultrasound, positron emission mammography and breast specific gamma imaging add to our diagnostic capabilities. On March 14, 2011 at the European Congress of Radiology in Vienna promising new data were presented on multimodal ultrasound tomography of the breast and its ability to find and differentiate benign from malignant breast lesions in sizes as low as 3mm. Given the fact that we can now find such small cancers with greater frequency and accuracy it is the responsibility of the surgical and interventional medical communities to develop techniques to accurately biopsy and treat these tumors using percutaneous imageguided techniques. 20 years ago, the standard of care upon finding a suspicious breast lesion was needle localization and surgical excisional biopsy. Today, the standard is first consider minimally invasive percutaneous image-guided biopsy using ultrasound, stereotactic or MRI guidance. 20 years ago, if breast cancer was diagnosed, the standard of care was to offer the patient a radical mastectomy regardless of the cancer size. Over the years this has changed from mastectomy to partial mastectomy to today's lumpectomies with partial breast irradiation. These techniques were developed in an attempt to improve cosmetic outcomes and to reduce patient morbidity.",

            "text": "1. To report on the rationale for local management of head and neck tumours 2. To describe the indications, patient selection and techniques for local treatment 3. To present results of local management of head and neck tumours The head and neck region is a complex anatomical region with many important anatomical structures which can be affected by malignancy. Most of the lesions can be diagnosed by clinical examination in combination with imaging, including CT, MRI and angiography. Biopsies are mainly done in clinical practice by the ENT or the maxillo-facial surgeons. The first treatment choice for head and neck malignancy is surgery, often followed by radiation therapy or combined radiochemotherapy. If surgery is not possible due to extensive tumor infiltration or general contraindications for surgery the treatment of first choice is radiation therapy or chemotherapy or a combination of both. So far there is no indication for image-guided therapy modalities in the primary treatment of head and neck cancer. Some studies however are indicating that initial intraarterial induction chemotherapy can help to improve the outcome of surgery. However, there are some situations where interventional radiology plays an important rule. This presentation will focus on imageguided biopsies and image-guided ablation of tumors in the head and neck region. First, image-guided biopsy can help in the approval or exclusion of a recurrent tumor. Different approaches as the subzygomatic approach, the retromandibular or retromaxillar approach and a variety of different direct approaches are available to puncture head and neck lesion. Most of the interventions are done under CT-guidance. However, there are also some interventions, which can be performed under MR-guidance or ultrasound guidance. Later on, especially, if the palliative treatment options for recurrent head and neck cancer are limited by the proximity of vital vascular and neural structures and the aggressive nature of these tumors. Depending on the localization of the recurrent tumor, a minimally invasive treatment modality such as radiofrequency ablation or MR-guided laser-induced thermotherapy offers a number of potential treatment benefits. First, imaging provides unparalleled topographic accuracy due to its excellent soft-tissue contrast and high spatial resolution. Secondly, the temperature sensitivity of specially designed MR-sequences can be used to monitor the temperature elevation in the tumor and surrounding normal tissues, thus increasing safety. On-line MR imaging during LITT therefore allows early detection of local complications and treatment effects such as bleeding, hemorrhage, or necrosis. Thirdly, recovery times, lengths of hospital stay, and the risk of infection and other complications can be reduced when compared with conventional palliative surgery. A further, indirect advantage is the psychological effect due to avoidance of cosmetic deformities that can result from major reconstructive surgery. Technically every available treatment device could be used for head and neck tumor ablation. Single tip needles have some advantages compared to umbrella type needles. I personally prefer bipolar radiofrequency devices. Most interventions can be done under local anesthesia with some mild sedation. CT-guided puncture is used to place the ablation probes. However, the indications for tumor ablation in the head and neck are limited. The main indication is not to cure the patient or prolong the survival, but to reduce the clinical symptoms like pain and needles and probes using imaging guidance, otherwise the data may be negatively skewed due to operator error. With their vast experience in ablation therapy and their advanced skills and training in performing precise image-guided biopsies and interventions, interventional radiologists are uniquely qualified to perform breast interventions including breast cancer ablation. Interventional radiologists should embrace the opportunity to participate in the research and development of these new techniques to treat primary breast cancer.",

Moreover, because IRE is a non-thermal technique, there appears to be complete ablation to the margin of blood vessels without compromising the functionality of the blood vessels. Therefore, issues associated with perfusion-mediated tissue cooling or heating (a significant challenge with thermal methods) are not relevant. Preclinical investigation focused on HCC has shown promising results. In a recent study, HCC tumors were grown in 30 Sprague-Dawley rats that were divided into treatment and control groups. For treatment group, IRE electrodes were inserted and eight 100 \u03bcsec, 2,500-V pulses were applied to ablate the targeted tumor tissues. Pathology correlation studies documented progression from poorly differentiated viable HCC tissues before treatment to extensive tumor necrosis and full regression in 9 of 10 treated rats 7 to 15 days after treatment. These findings suggest that IRE can be an effective strategy for targeted ablation of HCC, and have prompted its clinical evaluation. Light-activated drug therapy uses light-emitting diodes to activate talaporfin sodium (Aptocine; Light Sciences Oncology, Bellevue, WA), a small drug molecule which is synthesized from a chlorophyll derivative. Talaporfin sodium has the capacity to concentrate in tumors when administered intravenously. It is then activated by a thin light emitting activator which is percutaneously inserted intratumorally under imaging guidance. The drug is capable of absorbing long wavelength light resulting in singlet oxygen that causes apoptotic cell death through oxidation and permanent tumor blood vessel closure. The device contains a tiny array of lightemitting diodes at the end of a very narrow (1.2-mm wide) flexible coated micro-wire. The array is inserted into the target tumor using a biopsy-like procedure requiring only a mild sedation. The device emits red light at a discrete frequency and intensity, for a fixed time period. Experimental studies suggest that singlet oxygen causes the destruction of all cells within the kill zone. The size of the kill zone is determined by the fluence level of activating light and the time of illumination. Research has shown that a maximum effective kill zone of 2.5 by 4.5 cm is achieved with a single catheter, although multiple catheters can be used in a single treatment to increase the kill zone. All vasculature within the kill zone is also quickly and permanently occluded by an accumulation of platelet fragments, fibrin deposition and vascular debris. Potential advantages of light-activated drug therapy with talaporfin sodium include the accurate prediction of the size of the kill zone by illumination time and fluence, the independency of treatment effect from tumor histotype and tumor location (proximity to large blood vessels or the gastrointestinal tract, for instance, neither affects the production of the primary kill zone nor is it associated with any complications) and the ability to treat large or multiple tumors in a single session requiring only mild sedation. Treatment with talaporfin sodium is generally well tolerated, although cutaneous photosensitivity requires attention and adequate protection. Of interest, findings from animal studies suggest that the production of large apop totic masses in tumors with lightactivated drug therapy yields tumor-specific clones of CD8+ T-cells which infiltrate distant, untreated tumors.

To present technical details of intervention and its potential clinical applications 3. To present the results of pre-clinical, animal and clinical studies New, non-chemical non-thermal image-guided ablation techniques are currently undergoing clinical investigation. These include irreversible electroporation (IRE) and light-activated drug therapy. These techniques promise to overcome some of the limitations of chemical and thermal-based techniques. Electroporation is a technique that increases cell membrane permeability by changing the transmembrane potential and subsequently disrupting the lipid bilayer integrity to allow transportation of molecules across the cell membrane via nano-size pores. This process -when used in a reversible fashion -has been used in research for drug or macromolecule delivery into cells. IRE is a method to induce irreversible disruption of cell membrane integrity resulting in cell death without the need for additional pharmacological injury. The IRE system (NanoKnife; AngioDynamics, Queensbury, NY) consists of two major components: a generator and needle-like electrical probes. The generator can deliver up to 3,000 V of energy in a maximum of 100 pulses which have a maximum pulse length of 100 \u03bcsec. The electrode probe is 19 G in diameter and has an active tip that can be exposed up to 4 cm. Two or more monopolar probes or a single bipolar probe must be used at a time. The number of monopolar probes that are used during an IRE procedure is dependent on the size and shape of the desired zone of tissue ablation. The treatment parameter for voltage is dependent on the distance between probes within the targeted tissue. IRE is administered under general anesthesia with administration of atracurium, cis-atracurium, pancuronium or an equivalent neuromuscular blocking agent to prevent undesirable muscle contraction. IRE creates a sharp boundary between the treated and untreated area in vivo. This would suggest that IRE has the ability to sharply delineate the treatment area from the nontreated, and that treatment planning can be precisely performed according to mathematical predictions. In addition, IRE can effectively create tissue death in micro-to millisecond ranges of treatment time compared to thermal ablation techniques, which require C RSE ",

To learn different clinical settings which may effect decision making process Systemic thrombolysis by intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is currently the only approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Intravenous rtPA at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg (10% given as a bolus, remainder given over 1 hour, maximum dose 90 mg) administered within 3 hours of symptom onset significantly improves functional outcome at 3 months when compared to placebo [1] [2] [3] . Meta-analysis of randomized trials of intravenous rtPA (NINDS, ECASS-I, ECASS-II, ATLANTIS) shows an absolute increase of ~12% in number of patients achieving a modified Rankin Scale between 0 and 2 with intravenous rtPA treatment compared to placebo [1] [2] [3] . However, only less than 5% of patients with ischemic stroke can be treated with intravenous rtPA in the real world setting either due to the narrow therapeutic time window or contraindications for treatment [4] . Furthermore, the effectiveness of intravenous thrombolysis is poor in patients with proximal arterial occlusions; intravenous rtPA establishes recanalization in less than 25% of patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion [5] . Although, the number of patients receiving systemic thrombolysis might increase in the near future by extension of time window for treatment to 4.5 hours after symptom onset, based on the results of the recently published ECASS-3 trial [6] , there still will be a significant amount of patients with acute ischemic stroke who will not receive intravenous rtPA or will not benefit from this treatment. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is considered as an attractive therapeutic option in such patients. The only prospective randomized trial that tested the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis was the PROACT-II trial, which compared intra-arterial prourokinase plus heparin with heparin alone in ischemic stroke patients secondary to middle cerebral artery occlusion admitted within 6 hours of symptom onset [7] . 40% of the patients in the prourokinase arm had a modified Rankin scale of 0-2 at 3 months, while 25% of the patients in the heparin only arm had favorable outcome. Despite these results, the treatment was not approved by the FDA and intra-arterial prourokinase did not become a standard of care in middle cerebral artery Special Session Introduction to acute stroke management: decision making process based on imaging/clinical findings and getting started 1604.1",

To understand decision making processes based on imaging with understanding the physiologic and clinical significance of the mismatch concept 4. To learn about future concepts in acute stroke imaging with flat panel technology Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. The goals of acute stroke imaging are to establish a diagnosis as early as possible to obtain accurate information about intracranial vasculature and brain perfusion to select the appropriate therapy. Comprehensive evaluation may be performed with a combination of CT or MRI. Unenhanced CT helps to rule out hemorrhage and may identify early signs of ischemic stroke, respectively. In addition, CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging may depict major vessel occlusion and perfusion disturbances indicating tissue at risk. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging is more sensitive in the detection of hyperacute ischemia. MR angiography reveals the status of extra-and intracranial vessels, and a mismatch between findings on diffusion and perfusion MR images may be pragmatically used to predict the presence of a penumbra. Regarding our own experience, \"multimodal MR imaging\" provides substantially greater information about brain ischemic pathophysiology and overall a more sensitive diagnosis for acute stroke, especially in patients with an uncertain time window of symptom onset and vertebrobasilar ischemia. Thus, combining various imaging techniques may help to differentiate patients who may profit from intravenous or interventional therapy in an even extended time window from those who do not. Thus we think that MRI should replace CT as the primary neuroimaging technique, at least in patients suspicious for vertebrobasilar ischemia or presenting in an extended time window. Acute stroke imaging protocols vary among institutions, depending on the availability of imaging time, software, and expertise. In our institution, we use a simple protocol that we believe is applicable at most institutions. We use a multimodal CT protocol when acute stroke patients present within 4.5 hours (ECASS III time window); patients presenting beyond this time window are examined with a multimodal MRI protocol. occlusions presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset. Until now, no placebo-controlled trial has evaluated the use of intra-arterial rtPA in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. Similarly, no placebocontrolled trial has been performed with mechanical clot retrieval devices. However, the MERCI clot retriever and the Penumbra system have been approved by the FDA as thrombectomy tools for clot removal from cerebral blood vessels, based on prospective, nonrandomized multicenter trials showing the efficacy and safety of these devices in patients with large vessel occlusions presenting within 8 hours of symptom onset [8, 9] . Bridging of intravenous thrombolysis and intra-arterial treatment is also a therapeutic alternative in patients unresponsive to intravenous rtPA. A pilot study has shown the feasibility and safety of intra-arterial treatment after intravenous rtPA [10] . The ongoing multi-center randomized IMS-III trial is now testing the efficacy of this approach versus intravenous rtPA alone. Intravenous rtPA is the standard of care for all eligible ischemic stroke patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset. The selection of patients that should be treated by systemic thrombolysis is clearly outlined in the current acute ischemic stroke management guidelines [11] . On the other hand, the selection of patients for intra-arterial thrombolysis is a challenging process. A number of clinical or imaging criteria are currently used to guide clinicians to identify patients that could benefit from intra-arterial thrombolysis, albeit no level I evidence is present for the efficacy of this treatment in such patients. a) Patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset, but who have contraindications for systemic thrombolysis might be considered for intra-arterial thrombolysis. In patients with recent history of surgery, gastrointestinal or genitourinary hemorrhage, myocardial infarction or coagulopathy systemic side effects can be minimized by intra-arterial thrombolysis, during which a low dose of fibrinolytic agent is used or no fibrinolytic is used at all. b) The site of arterial occlusion is a key-factor in the decision algorithm for intra-arterial thrombolysis. This therapeutic option is considered for patients with proximal arterial occlusions and high clot burden, like internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery stem and basilar artery occlusions. The vascular status should be evaluated by a non-invasive method like computerized tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in all patients with acute ischemic stroke for the possibility of an intra-arterial intervention. As there is currently no randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous thrombolysis vs. intra-arterial thrombolysis, it is unknown whether patients with proximal arterial occlusions should be directly taken to the angiography suite even if admitted within 3 hours of symptom onset. However, bridging of intra-venous and intra-arterial thrombolysis can always be considered as an option in such patients. c) Aside from arterial status, the presence of salvageable brain tissue is critical to attain maximum benefit from intra-arterial thrombolysis. The presence of clinical-diffusion mismatch, diffusion-perfusion mismatch or CBV-MTT mismatch can be used to identify patients with significant amount of ischemic penumbra that might be salvaged by recanalization and reperfusion [12, 13] . In addition, the amount of brain tissue that has already undergone irreversible damage might be a critical factor in deciding to proceed on with intra-arterial thrombolysis [14] . ",

As an interventionist who wants to start a stroke practice, to learn basics of endovascular treatment 3. To learn what kind of endovascular tools we have to keep handy to get started Management of acute stroke, known as a leading cause of death and adult disability all over the world, still remains as a challenge despite rapidly developing technical innovations in materials used for intracranial endovascular re-vascularization procedures. Thromboembolic occlusion of major cerebral arteries is commonly associated with significant neurologic deficit and poor outcome. As acute stroke treatment could be defined as a \"race against time\", an on-call team including emergency room physicians, neurologists and interventional radiologists should be available for 24 hours to evaluate the patient and select the accurate management. Stroke management protocols could possibly differ among centers but intravenous thrombolysis with rtTPA for the treatment of ischemic stroke in selected patients within 3 hours after stroke onset is gained wide acceptance. This period is considered as critical time for the interventional team to be at the angio suit at night times. Intraarterial intervention may then be considered either as primary intervention or as rescue intervention after systemic thrombolysis. First step of intracranial endovascular treatment of acute stroke is obtaining access to the related arterial territory. Majority of these patients carry the potential risk of supraaortic atherosclerosis and anatomic adversity due to severe tortuosity of the affected vessels. Therefore, access achievement begins with long vascular sheath placement up to common carotid or subclavian arteries to obtain advanced support for further catheter manipulations. After that, an atraumatic guiding catheter with appropriate inner diameter (at least 6 F) is advanced to ICA or vertebral arteries. Subsequently used materials and methods for intra-arterial interventions have different alternatives such as intra-arterial application of thrombolytic agents, mechanical clot extraction and aspiration, or angioplasty and stent application. Recanalization rate, showing well correlation with clinical outcome, depends on the location of the occlusion within the cerebral artery. The intra-arterial approach offers the advantage of higher concentration of thrombolytic agents over intravenous administration which results in higher recanalization rates for major cerebral artery occlusions. However, increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and the delay for initiation of intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy approach counterbalance these advantages. Recently, new endovascular devices used for mechanical clot extraction and aspiration is gaining increased popularity among neurointerventionals. Early experience with MERCI clot retraction device revealed similar efficacy and safety rate compared with PROACT-II study which evaluated prourokinase for recanalization of acute occluded cerebral arteries. In the multi-center, prospective Multi-MERCI trial 55% percent of recanalization with device itself alone was reported. Recanalization rate was increased to 68% with combination of mechanical and intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy. The Penumbra is another mechanical throbectomy system designed specifically for removal of clot by an aspiration system. Multi-center international trial has achieved promising results with relatively good outcomes with 100% recanalization in 20 patients. Another recent single-center study revealed complete revascularization Munich 2011",

Complications of the nephrostomy in non-dilated kidney and their management The main indication for percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) is relief of ureteric obstruction. These kidneys present with calyceal dilatation and renal access is straightforward, under combined sonographicfluoroscopic guidance. Pure CT or ultrasound-guided PCN is also feasible. The safest route is via a prone, postero-lateral approach targeted precisely onto a posterior facing lower pole calyx. This minimises the risk of pelvic or arterial injury, as the path to the kidney is through renal substance and the relatively avascular territory To compare CT and MR urography with ultrasound 3. How to use MR or CT to help to percutaneous access Both CT and MR urography (CTU, MRU) feature unenhanced and contrast-enhanced examination techniques for imaging of the entire urinary tract. Contrast-enhanced excretory CTU and T1-weighted MRU are primarily used to obtain detailed urograms of the nondilated collecting system with preserved excretory function. On the other hand, the use of intravenous contrast material is not necessary in order to identify and access markedly dilated pelvicalices, both in CT and MRI. Moreover, unenhanced T2-weighted static-fluid MRU is the only imaging technique that provides typical urographic views of dilated urinary tracts, even if the renal function is severely impaired. CT offers high-spatial resolution and precise delineation of any puncture material, whereas MRI impresses with its inherent soft tissue contrast and missing radiation exposure. Since many years, ultrasound (US) is considered the imaging method of choice for realtime guidance of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN). The use of ultrasound for gaining access to the pelvicalices may occasionally be confronted with problems in obese patients, or anatomic anomalies (eg. parapelvic cysts), or in nondilated urinary tracts. In case of failed US-guided PCN, CTU and MRU are potential alternative modalities for directing a puncture needle to the pelvicaliceal system. Indeed, it has been confirmed with several studies that PCN is accomplished under CTU-guidance with excellent precision and safety. For minimizing radiation exposure, CTU can be performed using low-dose protocols (80kVp). In addition, CT-guided nephrostomy has also been suggested for the protection of the collecting system during renal radiofrequency ablation. Unlike CT, MRU-guided PCN is not a clinically proven method although initial experimental studies demonstrated a good feasibility. Until now, only little clinical experience exists with MRU-guided PCN in a total of 34 patients worldwide, as reported in the literature. ",

Percutaneous treatment of renal transplant leak and obstruction Obstruction of the ureter Urinary tract obstruction is diagnosed in 2-10% of kidney recipients. The diagnosis is based on SCr increase and confirmed by dilatation of the graft collecting system. The most common cause of obstruction is ureteral stricture, localized almost exclusively in the distal ureter caused by ureteral ischemia as a result of devascularization during graft harvesting. Other causes of obstruction include blood clots, compression of the ureter, anastomosis edema, technical error during ureter implantation, fibrosis in the pelvic area or kidney stone. Antegrade pyelography confirms the diagnosis. Percutaneous treatment involves nephrostomy, balloon dilatation, insertion of external-internal or internal drainage using plastic catheters and/or metallic stent placement. A therapy of stricture is dilatation using a 7-8 mm balloon catheter.",

            "text": "As kidney graft recipients receive immunosuppression, urinary leak is a potentially life-threatening complication. Leaks are most often diagnosed at weeks 1 to 2 post-transplant and reported to develop in 1-5% of all graft recipients. Urinary leak may be due to ischemic ureteral necrosis or erroneous surgical technique. It occurs most often in the distal ureter. Rarely, leaks may develop in the proximal ureter, renal pelvis, or calyces, usually secondary to ischemic necrosis due to occlusion of the accessory renal artery during harvesting and/or transplantation. Another rare cause is a complication of renal biopsy. Leak is diagnosed by ultrasound detecting perirenal fluid followed by percutaneous aspiration and fluid analysis. The first-line treatment is urinary catheter insertion followed by nephrostomy. The nephrostomy may be technically challenging as the collecting system is usually not dilated. Whilst external-internal drainage for 2-3 months is commonly successful in the treatment of urinary leaks some patients develop stricture at the site of healed leak requiring further treatment. If indicated, surgical therapy is usually preceded by nephrostomy. Nephrostomy restores renal function, allowing to perform surgery as a scheduled one. The leaks indicated for surgery include particularly early diagnosed leaks, large leaks, and those not responding to percutaneous therapy. Morgan RA (1999) Management of ureteral strictures in renal transplants by between the anterior and posterior renal circulation. Large series have documented the success of this procedure. Guidelines from the American College of Radiology quote a success rate of 98%. But sometimes PCN is required for non-dilated kidneys, e.g. nondilated kidneys with leaking ureters, to divert the urinary stream. This is more challenging as there is no large, visible calyx on ultrasound; and if the calyces are opacified using intravenous contrast, the posterior calyces are not well seen in the prone position. Furthermore, the smaller calyx makes wire/catheter manipulation difficult. Hence, the ACR guidelines quote a technical success rate of 80% with non-dilated kidneys. Initial careful ultrasound examination is necessary to confirm absent calyceal dilatation. Any further imaging is not routinely necessary. Regarding technique, the especial hurdles to overcome are that the favoured posterior facing calyx is small and not well seen. Therefore, preferential visualisation and distension of this calyx has to be created. In the authors opinion this is most easily done by double contrast pyelography. A 22 G needle is inserted into the renal pelvis (under US or fluoroscopic guidance) and room air or carbon dioxide carefully instilled. Being buoyant, the gas gravitates into and distends the posterior calyces. This will persist for many minutes and there is sufficient time to target a second sheathed needle onto the chosen calyx. A hydrophilic wire is necessary to manoeuvre out of the small calyx. Forming a pigtail in a small renal pelvis can also present a difficulty.",

            "text": "Complications are inevitable when performing any form of surgical or interventional procedure on the kidney. Surgical techniques are continually advancing with less invasive surgery leading to lower mortality rates. However, laparoscopic surgery is still prone to complications. Patients may well have non-specific symptoms and imaging is key in making an accurate diagnosis to allow interventional treatment. Laparoscopic surgical techniques may well provide some unexpected imaging findings which need to be recognised. These will be discussed and examples shown. Complications of laparoscopic and open surgery will be shown including haemorrhage, abscess formation and fistulas. Complications of renal transplantation will also be shown. Management will be discussed with imaging and video examples of technique and equipment used. Of course as interventional radiologists we also encounter our own complications and it is vital that we are able to recognise and treat these appropriately. I will discuss complications of nephrostomy, PCNL and stent insertion. These complications will be illustrated with examples from my own extensive list of complications. Examples will again include images and video to illustrate how these cases were managed. I will also show a technique for removing 'forgotten ureteric stents obviating the need for percutaneous access. Once we have managed a complication it is important to continue to see the patient in order to observe their progress and look for anything further that may need to be done. An important observation is that of a drainage catheter or nephrostomy. These are frequently mismanaged by ward staff who are not familiar with them. Visits to the ward may avoid the 'We found it in the bed doctor!' scenario. The decision to treat and choice of intervention in peripheral arterial disease is governed by the severity of the patient's symptoms and extent of athero-occlusive disease. Patients with claudication often have proximal, single vessel disease, while patients with critical ischemia will have multi-segment and infra-popliteal disease (1) . Imaging of the smaller infra-popliteal vessels can be challenging, but vital for planning patient treatment. The imaging modality should be chosen so as to maximise the quality and relevance of the information obtained, minimise the risks and inconvenience to the patient, although invasive angiography is still considered by many to be the gold standard in the management of patients with peripheral vascular disease, particularly with critical ischemia. There have also been huge advances in non-invasive imaging, particularly Duplex, MRA and CTA . Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) enables imaging of the entire peripheral vascular tree including the aorta with high spatial and contrast resolution. It remains however, an invasive procedure requiring ionizing radiation and potentially nephrogenic contrast medium all which carry a small but appreciable risk (2, CTA is a three-dimensional technique that provides information about the imaged vessels and adjacent structures. It requires only venous vascular access and is an outpatient examination with minimal risk.",

            "text": "Although it is possible to assess the aorto-iliac arteries with single slice CT. Using a single-detector spiral CT cannot provide imaging of the entire lower extremity. In an early feasibility study in 1995, Lawrence et al. reported imaging a portion of the lower extremity from the groin to the proximal calf in six patients with single detector spiral CT angiography. The patients were studied with 5 mm slices. The studies were performed over an area of interest of 60 cm and took more than two minutes to acquire. Another study by Raptouplos showed the aorto-iliac arteries could be successfully imaged using two sequential helical scans (15) . A later study performed by Beregi et al (16) imaged the popliteal arteries in patients suspected of having popliteal artery disease. This study demonstrated increased sensitivity and specificity in the detection of patients with popliteal artery aneurysms, as well as improved characterization of arterial compression by adventitial cysts and entrapment syndromes. However, these could not image the whole of the arterial tree and had limited ability to reconstruct images. MDCT has shorter scanning durations, thinner sections of entire anatomic territories, and greater longitudinal coverage. Rubin et al. used MDCT angiography on 24 patients with symptomatic lower extremity occlusive disease. The study used 2.5 mm slices to acquire images extending from the abdominal aorta to the feet. The average study time was a little over one minute and covered 1.2 meters. This study demonstrated a 100% concordance between CT and conventional angiography at direct comparison (17) . Since several other studies have now shown good concordance with angiography. A recent review of all CTA studies has shown a median sensitivity of 91% (89-98%) and median specificity of 91% (83-97%) (14) . As with MRA, CTA can potentially demonstrate eccentric stenoses (18) , and also more accurately determine the length of long occlusions. The excellent demonstration of adjacent structures and of coexistent aneurysms is a further advantage of CTA. Although operator dependency has been cited as a problem with curved multiplanar reconstructions (19) . This was partly because earlier studies used predominantly maximum intensity projections which are of limited use in CTA because the vascular lumen is frequently obscured by mural calcification so that differentiation between tight stenoses and occlusion can be difficult and is cited as a major cause for decrease in the clinical utility of CTA in PVD (20) . Post-processing with adequate windowing and the use of curved multiplanar reconstructions generally enables confident discrimination between vascular calcification and intravascular contrast medium. In large arteries such as the aorta and iliac's using the Mastercut technique or the semitransparent volume-rendering technique (21) can also be used to overcome problems with calcifications, but this is not always feasible for the smaller more distal vessels (22) . Dual energy CT offers a potential solution to rapidly remove calcium from the images, but is not yet widely available. Another disadvantage of CTA is that very short stenoses may be missed, as its resolution in the z-axis is considerably inferior to conventional angiography (15) . It still requires potentially nephrogenic contrast medium and a relatively high radiation dose to patients although compared to standard digital subtraction angiography the radiation dose is 3.9 times lower (23) . But despite these limitations, diagnostic performance below the knee remains good (sensitivity 85-99%, specificity 79-97%) and can be an it sometimes fails to demonstrate eccentric stenoses, especially if not routinely performed in two planes. The diagnostic accuracy is also adversely affected by vascular calcification and aneurysmal disease can also sometimes be missed. Contrast angiography is now on the whole reserved for patients who are being considered for endovascular therapy or for problem solving where other non-invasive modalities have failed.",

            "text": "Several non-invasive imaging modalities now exist. Duplex is widely available, cheap and free from side effects and is particularly attractive for non-invasive imaging in peripheral vascular occlusive disease (4) (5) (6) . The speed of imaging can be increased up using standard and power Doppler. Although time consuming and technically demanding, duplex has a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of significant disease, i.e. stenoses >50% using a combination of peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the site of stensoses, the ratio of the PSV at the stenoses and the immediate normal velocity, end diastolic velocity and more subjective criteria such as number of phases in the Doppler waveform and degree of spectral broadening. The most important parameter to grade stenoses is the PSV ratio . Using these criteria reported median sensitivity and specificity are 88% (80-98%) and 96% (89-99%), respectively (4) (5) (6) for the detection of >50% stenoses in peripheral arterial disease. Several authors now also advocate using duplex as the only imaging modality prior to endovascular or surgical treatment (4) (5) (6) . However, in their extensive review of imaging in PVD, Collins et al (4) concluded that overall duplex was probably the least accurate of all the imaging modalities. In addition, the assertion that duplex is relatively inexpensive has also been recently challenged by the Netherlands-based diagnostic imaging of peripheral arterial disease (DIPAD) trial, which suggest an overall higher cost for duplex, probably explained by the need for additional imaging in 43% of their patients (8) . However, these factors other than calcification are less of an issue in the infragenicular vessels. The proximity of the vessels to the transducer probe to the tibial vessels make them ideal for duplex. Eiberg concluded that duplex was the best imaging technique of the distal crural arteries (technical success 97% v 92% for DSA) (7) . However, most units have duplex imaging and this is the mainstay of imaging in PVD allowing treatment planning in the majority of patients. It is the imaging of choice in patients with renal failure where there are significant risks of contrast-induced nephropathy or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) MRA has advanced rapidly over the last decade and is now a invaluable technique in the assessment of arteries of the pelvis and lower limbs. This technique is non-invasive and requires no ionizing radiation. Contrast-enhanced MRA with its greater sensitivity and specificity has now replaced 2D time of flight and phase contrast MRA. Using better K space acquisition, improved techniques such as parallel imaging, stronger, faster gradients in combination with newer MR contrast agents, multiple 3D MRA data sets covering multiple vascular beds can be obtained in rapid succession (9) (10) (11) . Where there has been direct comparison MRA is at least as accurate if not better than either duplex or CTA (11) (12) (13) (14) . In addition, compared to DSA not only does MRA demonstrate more run off vessels but also potentially demonstrate eccentric stenoses, retrograde filling of vessels distal to an occlusion by collaterals giving a more accurate assessment of length of occlusions. Overall contrast-enhanced MRA has the highest diagnostic accuracy of all the non-invasive imaging techniques with reported median sensitivity of 95% (92-99.5%) and specificity 97% (64-99%) for stenoses of >50% (4) . Also in their recent review, Collins et al concluded that contrast-enhanced MRA was more specific than CTA, more sensitive than duplex and was generally preferred by patients over contrast angiography (4) .",

To learn about the clinical implications of the angiosomal concept Territorial revascularization of the malperfused area is one fundamental concept in the treatment of patients with chronic critical limb ischemia. Ideally all three large crural arteries should be recanalized with a continuous peripheral run-off to the foot. However, this is often technically not possible. In these cases it should be the goal to recanalize those vessels which are major contributors to the angiosmes in which the soft tissue lesion is located. The foot and ankle can be devided into 6 angiosomes. Each angiosome is supplied by one of the main arteries of the lower limb. The angiosome concept has been introduced by plastic surgeons (1); however, this concept can also be applied to revascularisation procedures in patients with critical limb ischemia. The posterior tibial artery with its branches supplies 3 angiosomes including the medial segment for the lower leg, and 2 segments of the planta pedis, which are perfused via the medial and lateral branch of the plantar artery. The medial plantar branch has an important interconnection to the anterior tibial artery. The anterior tibial artery supplies the anterior part of both ankles and its continuation, the dorsal pedal artery supplies the dorsum of the foot. The peroneal artery supplies the lateral portions of both ankles and the rear foot. There are multiple interconnection between the angiosomes which may provide collateral perfusion if needed (2) . Although extensive studies are not available in the literature, it has been shown in small series that direct revascularization of an artery which supplies the angiosome where a soft tissue defect is present yields better results compared to indirect revascularization, where an artery is recanalized which is not the main contributor to the angionsome where the lesion is located (3). In any case it is very important that the operator who performs the recanalization procedure has a clear understanding of the vascular anatomy of the lower leg and the foot and knows exactly in which invaluable tool for problem solving where other imaging techniques have failed.",

To learn about the results Since the introduction of endovascular therapy to the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI), interventions in below the ankle arteries were basically limited to the treatment of anastomosis-related problems after pedal bypass. PTA has been used as a repair technique for restenosis in pedal anastomosis after distal pedal bypass surgery. Until now pedal occlusive disease still remains as one of the least treated territory regarding endovascular techniques. However, with the introduction of new techniques and low profile devices endovascular techniques have also gained access to pedal interventions, and represent and probably underestimated field with amazing solutions. Discussing modern concepts of endovascular treatment below the knee , de novo lesions in pedal arteries should be considered in a global therapy concept in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), Rutherford category 4-6, on the basis of non-healing gangrene and/ or ulcerations of the foot associated with a critically low level of oxygen tension (TcPO2). Starting with the pre-evaluation and patient selection, in patients with long occlusions of below-the-knee (BTK) vessels, foot vessels should critically be examined and imaged coincidentally, as the patency of plantar arch vessels provides essential blood flow to both the forefoot and the calcaneal region. Treatment of below the knee vessels becomes only effective when the outflow conditions are optimized Regarding technical concepts for such indications Manzi et al described the pedal-plantar loop technique, which consists of the recanalization of both pedal and plantar arteries and their anatomical anastomoses. This technique was designed for patients with extensive trophic alteration of the foot requiring the maximum improvement in blood flow support. Further it might also be used in cases in which it is necessary to use a retrograde approach coming from the plantar arch to treat the anterior or posterior tibial artery as the target vessel when antegrade crossing becomes impossible. Antegrade femoral puncture is essential for performing BTK and pedal procedures. Devices are used on a 4 or 5F basis. Baseline angiograms should be performed including the pedal arteries in a clear overview, and magnification techniques. Lesions are generally approached with a system consisting of hydrophilic .014-inch guidewires, supported by low-profile balloon catheter, specifically designed for BTK interventions, in various lengths.",

            "text": "1. To learn about the indications for a retrograde approach 2. To learn about the technique 3. To learn about the results and specific problems and complications Technical success of recanalization in crural arteries depends on the type of lesion and the catheter material used. In stenotic lesions recanalization is successful in 84-98%, however, in occlusions only in 21-76% [2, 3, 5] . In studies using 5F systems [1, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] recanalization succeeded in 75-92% (mean value 86%) and in studies using 4F systems with optional bail-out stenting [11] [12] [13] [14] the recanalization rate was 89-96% (mean value 94%). If appropriate catheter materials and techniques are used angioplasty of crural arteries is technically successful in 89-96%. However, the main negative predictor of failed recanalization is the length of lesion in case of occlusions. If endoluminal recanalization techniques (like drilling technique and step-by-step technique using different types of wires and support catheters) have failed, the technique of intended dissection may be successful. However, this technique is less effective in crural arteries compared to femoropopliteal arteries [18] . Creating a re-entry more distally than necessary is an important drawback of this technique in BTK arteries. Dedicated reentry devices of appropriate size are not available for crural arteries. If antegrade crossing of occlusions in BTK arteries using the standard transfemoral approach has failed, assistant retrograde passage of the lesion via transcrural or transpedal approach may facilitate successful recanalization. Selection of appropriate puncture sites in tibial arteries for retrograde approach has to consider the lesion location, arterial diameter, skin pathologies and -if applicable optional landing zones for bypass grafting. Native arterial wall calcification, temporary artery opacification by contrast injection via the femoral sheath and road map technique are useful for puncture guidance. Considering the anatomical topography of tibial arteries rotation of the calf to the outer direction is necessary. For puncture of the anterior tibial artery 10 degrees rotation and for puncture of the posterior tibial artery 45 degrees rotation are useful to obviate injuries of accompanying nerves during the needle is advanced in anterior-posterior direction. For puncture, 21 Gauge needles are used with length between 7 and 10 cm. A 0.018\" guide wire is then gently advanced under fluoroscopic control into the arterial lumen. If the lesion cannot be crossed by the wire a 4F balloon catheter can be used for support and dilatation if necessary. After the retrograde wire has traversed the lesion often the passage of the antegrade wire is successful. If not undersized dilatation from both side will facilitate crossing with the antegrade wire. If that is also not successful snaring of the retrograde wire via the femoral sheath is another possibility. These options are used to allow continuation of angioplasty via the transfemoral access. If a transfemoral guide wire is placed across the lesion next step of the procedure is closure of the crural puncture site by endoluminal balloon occlusion over 3 to 5 minutes. If the puncture site is not closed angiographically after that time additional external compression by a pressure cuff should be used. Afterwards angioplasty of the target lesion is finished. Steps of transcrural procedure are demonstrated. Transpedal access via dorsal pedal artery is performed following the same steps of the procedure. This artery is easy to puncture under fluoroscopic guidance and during temporary contrast opacification after the foot had been turned and fixed in an appropriate position for anterior-posterior needle passage. Shorter needles can be used. Closure of the puncture site is performed by simple manual 427 C RSE",

Several publications reported promising outcomes and overall survival comparable to surgery. Despite the safety and efficiency of the modality, the lack of tissue examinations and margins' evaluations remain an important limitation of the technique when compared to resection. This limitation may explain the relative high rate of local tumor progression (LTP) reported after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Prior series have examined the tissue of ablated tumors in animals as well as in humans. Some of these examinations demonstrated that thermal injury -tumor necrosis -results in early tissue changes; however, the histological appearance of thermal injury consistent with necrosis may not be evident until 24 or even 72 hours after treatment. Other studies demonstrated coagulation necrosis on a significant number of specimens evaluated immediately after ablation. Special viability stains have also been applied and demonstrated lack of viability in ablated cells that maintain their morphology. Areas of tumor have been seen on other studies when examining tissue extracted on multitined RF electrodes after treatment of liver tumors.

To discuss the mechanism of action of radioembolization at a cellular level 2. To discuss how radiation induced cell damage relates to tumour death or tumour triggering 3. To analyze how understanding these interactions may lead in the future to better tumour control Non-loaded microspheres trigger virtually no inflammatory response in the target tissue, with no evidence of either prolonged inflammatory reaction or fibrosis. Particles by themselves do not provoke any necrotic effect neither in the treated liver tumor nor in the surrounding non-tumoral parenchyma. The therapeutic effect of radioembolization is caused exclusively by the cytotoxic damage of radiation (Yttrium 90 is a pure beta-emitter). The information available about histologic response to RE is scarce. For reasons not yet well understood (tumoral hemodynamics?), some nodules retain a large amount of particles centrally and others, only in the periphery. The intratumoral effect appears to evolve over time and begins with confluent areas of coagulative necrosis. There is no direct correlation between the number of days and the extent of necrosis; however, radiation needs some time to achieve its cytotoxic effect. It has been demonstrated that, within the first three months, the number of nodules without complete necrosis was significantly higher than after this period of time. Coagulative necrosis is associated with an increase in fibrinoid organization and at nine months the necrotic tissue becomes walled-off by a fibrous pseudocapsule. For this reason, the evaluation of the tumoral size is not the most adequate method to evaluate the radiologic response to RE. A decrease in the tumoral contrast uptake seems to reflect the degree of response earlier and more confidently. Radiation will also affect the non-tumoral liver parenchyma included in the treated liver volume. At early stages some foci of sinusoidal congestion can be observed. Months after the treatment there will appear areas of hepatic fibrosis with a decrease in the size of the hepatocites. In cases of whole liver treatment, the presence of hepatic fibrosis will provoke portal hypertension which can have clinical and radiological manifestations. Four to eight weeks after the treatment some patients (<5%) will present jaundice and ascites. This unusual syndrome, radioembolization-induced liver disease-REILD, is caused by an endothelial injury at the centrizonal sinusoids and manifested as a veno-occlusive disease. This endothelial injury, due to radiation, appears more frequently in patients heavily pretreated with chemotherapy. In patients who receive lobar or segmental treatments, the hepatic fibrotic response of the treated volume will be compensated by a contralateral liver lobe hypertrophy. Liver hypertrophy, caused by nodular regeneration, can be similar to that observed after",

To discuss if hypoxia/anoxia are related to tumour death or tumour triggering 3. To analyze how understanding these interactions may lead in the future to better tumour control The rationale for regional chemotherapy is to maximize drug concentrations and tumor drug uptake in the target organ and minimize systemic toxicity. For regional drug delivery to successfully impact relevant outcomes, several important principles regarding tumor biology, drug pharmacology and delivery systems must be fulfilled. Liver cancer, either primary or secondary from colorectal cancer, complies with these principles, as liver cancer has a regional pattern of dissemination (with the liver being the only site of metastatic disease for long periods of time in some cases) that supports a loco-regional approach. Other salient features include the selective blood supply of liver cancer by the hepatic artery and availability of active drugs with suitable pharmacokinetic properties. The ultimate goal of regional therapy is to improve the therapeutic index by increasing efficacy and decreasing systemic toxicity. Hepatic arterial therapy relies on two important assumptions: regional delivery of the drug leads to increased local concentration and therefore increased therapeutic response and regional delivery of the drug leads to decreased systemic exposure and reduced systemic toxicity. The suitability of any specific drug for regional therapy can be evaluated by the extent to which it fulfills these assumptions. However, drugs that must be activated at a site other than the arterial infusion site have no regional delivery advantage. It should be noted that although pharmacokinetic parameters may allow a selective increase in hepatic tumor exposure, the crucial target effect of a particular drug (e.g. DNA incorporation of a thymidine analog) might also exhibit non-linear kinetics. In this case, the impact on what actually is most important, the drug effect, rather than the increased drug concentration, might be less selective at high than at low dose rates. This is the concept of tissue-related pharmacokinetics and takes into account not only saturating pharmacokinetics in the tumor but also in systemic tissues. If at high dose rates, the plateau for the effect is higher in systemic tissues rather than for the tumor itself, loss of regional selectivity is observed. The paradigm that increased dose will result in increased biologic effect has been challenged by the recent development of targeted agents active against cancer. Most cytotoxic drugs act on DNA or tubulin, exhibit a sigmoidal steep dose-response curve and dose selection is based on maximal tolerated dose. However, for targeted therapies, more is not necessarily better. Pharmacodynamic effect is thought to be the result of receptor occupancy and saturation. Optimal target inhibition occurs at a specific drug concentration, and increasing the dose will not increase the effect. Furthermore, at useful drug concentrations, the maximum tolerated dose may have not been reached. As this has been recognized, the need for new strategies to define the clinically active dose level for this kind of drugs is evident. The traditional phase I trial, useful for cytotoxic drugs dose selection, does not accomplish the goal for targeted agents. Other parameters including pharmacokinetic endpoints such as achieving a predefined target plasma level or direct measurement of target inhibition may be more relevant. It is therefore very likely that as the field of interventional radiology C RSE",

Recent studies have demonstrated that serum VEGF per platelet is correlated with tumor VEGF expression (mRNA and protein expression) making VEGF dosage a useful and simple tool that correlates with tumor vascular density, and clinically with more aggressive tumors with liver infiltration, venous invasion and distant metastases. It has been also demonstrated that high serum VEGF poorly influences outcome before chemo-embolization. High VEGF levels are correlated with poor response to treatment. Their influence on response to angiogenic treatment seems to appear in the literature (the higher VEGF A and C before anti-angiogenic the better response and overall survival). On the other hand, an increase in VEGF levels after TACE has also been documented. From this observation, development of combined treatment has been developed with combination of anti-angiogenic oral treatment such as sorafenib or sunitinib before TACE. Hypoxia-inductible factor-1 is a protein that targets genes involved in oxygen transport like erythropoetin, angiogenesis like VEGF, nitric oxide production, and endothelin1, but also cell growth and apoptosis through genes coding for insulin growth factor. HIF1 is a target for development of new treatment that could be combined with TACE. When a tumor is treated by TACE, the tumor hypoxia induces changes in tumor metabolism is based on HIF1 controlled glycolysis. Therefore, inhibition of HIF1 cascade could potentialize cell death after tumor embolization. New embolic materials like DC beads and Y 90 have different impact on angiogenic cascades. Latest information about these new techniques will be given. This presentation emphasizes the absolute necessity of a better understanding at the cellular level of our treatments. More precise information of the cellular effects of our different treatments not only at the macroscopic but also at microscopic and cellular levels is mandatory to improve our results.

To learn how to avoid complications in terms of right patient and tool selection 3. To learn how to manage the complications when they still set in Every endovascular stroke treatment technique aims to recanalize the occluded vessel as efficient and fast as possible. Since the introduction of endovascular treatment techniques back in the 1950s, parenchymal as well as vascular complications have been reported. During the natural course of acute ischemic stroke, approximately 2% of all patients will suffer spontaneous symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) due to hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. The intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT), locally applying fibrinolytic drugs (such as urokinase, pro-urokinase or rt-PA) increase this risk of sICH. The Proact II study (1) found sICH with neurological deterioration within 24 hours in 10% of patients undergoing intraarterial thrombolysis. Despite this significantly increased risk compared to the placebo group, the percentage of patients with mRS 6 after 90 days is not elevated. To assess hemorrhagic complications, patients are monitored for neurological deterioration and follow-up imaging after 24 h is mandatory after stroke treatment. The underlying cause of sICH, the hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct, has no further endovascular treatment option and neurosurgical evacuation may be necessary (2) . Vascular complications following IAT have been described but are generally rare. In order to reduce or omit fibrinolytic drugs and therefore reduce the risk of sICH, mechanical recanalization techniques have been increasingly investigated and clinically applied in the recent years (3) . As assumed, most studies on mechanical recanalization in conjunction with IAT have shown a lower incidence of sICH on the basis of hemorrhagic transformation. However, the large trial on the clinical application of the distal devices, the Merci device group in the Multi Merci Trial (4), has shown 5.5% clinically significant procedural complications and 2.4% device-related serious adverse events including intracranial vessel dissection and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The clinical trial on a different and proximal mechanical approach, the Penumbra system, has shown comparable complication rates (sICH 11.2%) including vessel perforations and SAH (5) . The new generation of stent-like retrieves (Trevo System, Solitaire FR, BonNet etc) has not been evaluated in large clinical trials yet. The few data on this novel group of thrombectomy devices have shown high recanalization rates and fast recanalization times (6, 7) . To prevent thromboembolic events during retrieval of distal devices (e.g. Merci) and stent-retrievers, proximal balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and aspiration at the balloon guiding catheter (flow reversal) is recommended. To reduce vascular complications, tortuosity of access and target vessel, occlusion length, intracranial collateral flow and anatomical variants have to be taken into account before deciding for one of the various recanalization techniques. In case of difficult access vessels such as tortuosity of stenosis of",

To learn different mechanical revascularization techniques and when to use it 3. To learn technical tips to decrease the complication rate The purpose of this talk is to understand the different revascularization techniques that have recently emerged and to show how mechanical revascularization differs from the pharmacological revascularization. The talk aims to explain the concept of different mechanical revascularization techniques and gives advice on when to use them. It aims to review current treatment options in acute ischemic stroke, focusing on the latest advances in the field of mechanical recanalization. These devices that recently made available for endovascular intracranial thrombectomy show great potential in acute stroke treatments. Compelling evidence of their recanalization efficacy comes from current mechanical embolectomy trials. In addition to allowing an extension of the therapeutic time window, mechanical recanalization devices can be used without adjuvant thrombolytic therapy, thus diminishing the intracranial bleeding risk. Therefore, these devices are particularly suitable in patients in whom thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated. IV and IA thrombolysis and bridging therapy are viable options in acute stroke treatment. Mechanical recanalization devices can potentially have a clinically relevant impact in the interventional treatment of stroke, but at the present time, a randomized study would be beneficial. In an effort to extend treatment availability to patients with stroke and to reduce the potential for intracranial hemorrhage, IA lysis is a viable option for those who present in the 3-to 6-hour time window, independent of the degree of neurologic impairment. Advantages and disadvantages of IA lysis, IV lysis, and combined IA/IV lysis will be discussed. Combination use of IA lytics and mechanical thrombectomy devices is increasing and may be successful when each single strategy failed. When IA lytics have been unsuccessful in lysing the clot, mechanical devices could successfully recanalize the occluded cerebral vessel and restore flow. The designs of the devices vary between their individual engineering concepts and their approaches to the clot, either proximally or distally. However, a significant concern is the risk of vessel penetration when the technique requires the interventionalist to navigate the embolectomy device distal to the clot. Stroke treatment improved when mechanical devices first became available. Although they were initially only accessible to patients who were part of trials, endovascular stroke interventions combined the use of IA thrombolytics, mechanical embolectomy devices, and angioplasty with or without stent placement. These procedures were implemented in patients who were either refractory to or ineligible for intravenous rtPA. The evolutionary journey of mechanical thrombectomy devices has traveled from adjunctive rescue treatment to frontline therapy. In essence, recanalization using mechanical means could not only extend the therapeutic window but also potentially reduce the number of bleeds that are frequently associated with thrombolytic therapy. Limitations of mechanical devices have been reported and attributed to vessel tortuosity, arterial stenosis, and inaccessibility of the thrombus due to its location and consistency. The ongoing registries of the Merci clot retriever and the Penumbra System as well as the IMS III trial should, in the future, provide further evidence of these emerging technologies. Early consideration of this technique in patients with acute stroke secondary 431 C RSE Hypertension is one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors. Lowering blood pressure indeed reduces this cardiovascular risk. Most hypertensive patients are classified as having \"essential hypertension\", i.e. hypertension without clear cause. For decades, it has been thought that the sympathetic over-activity is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Especially, in the past 10-15 years much progress has been achieved in understanding the pathophysiology by studying various experimental and human conditions of chronic kidney disease. Hypertensive chronic kidney disease patients (CKD) have increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, which represents the centrally generated sympathetic nerve activity directed to resistance vasculature). Bilaterally, nephrectomized patients have MSNA comparable to controls, indicating that the signal that commands the brain to increase sympathetic outflow is generated in the diseased kidneys. Unilateral nephrectomy for the purpose of transplantation did not affect MSNA. Disease conditions characterized by sympathetic hyperactivity, quantified by the MSNA technique, include CKD, heart failure, essential hypertension, metabolic syndrome/obesity-associated hypertension. In experimental studies, it was found that even a limited kidney lesion, not affecting GFR, results in neurogenic hypertension, which is reduced or prevented by kidney denervation. Both an ACEinhibitor and an angiotensin II antagonist reduce MSNA (1). These data taken together indicate that in humans the diseased kidneys are the key players in the pathogenesis of increased MSNA. Our hypothesis is that kidney ischemia is of critical importance in the pathogenesis (for review, see reference 2).",

            "text": "There is much evidence that sympathetic hyperactivity is indeed harmful. Blood pressure in CKD patients correlates with MSNA, and blood pressure reduction during chronic ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II antagonist correlates with the decrease of MSNA. However, more importantly, there is substantial evidence that it also contributes to the development of cardiovascular organ damage, kidney failure progression and clinical outcome including mortality, and that these associations are partially independent of blood pressure (2) . the ICA, the application of the proximal balloon guiding catheter for stent-retrievers and distal devices is often complicated. Furthermore, it carries the risk of thromboembolic events and may cause cervical dissection due to balloon inflation. Dislodging thrombus in previously unaffected vessel territories will in most cases worsen the clinical status and neurological outcome of the patient dramatically. This vascular complication does not only involve an additional brain area into the ischemic stroke but also disables essential pial collaterals to the previously affected territory. Vessels originating proximally to the occlusion site (e.g. ACA or fetal variant of the posterior cerebral artery from the ICA in MCA occlusion) have to be protected from thromboembolic events during stroke treatment whenever possible. Therefore, in some clinical settings the application of IAT and local disruption is safer than mechanical approaches and thrombus retrieval. Due to the vessel diameter of below 2 mm the treatment of occlusions in M2-branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and within the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory is limited using mechanical and especially distal devices. These areas of the vascular tree are more prone for vessel wall damage during mechanical manipulation. The treatment of complications is complex and mainly tailored to the individual clinical situation. sICH is a frequent parenchymal complication following any kind of recanalization technique. Therefore, endovascular stroke treatment has to be embedded in an interdisciplinary environment including neurology, neurosurgery and neuroimaging. The increasing application of mechanical recanalization techniques and the reduction of IAT seem to reduce the incidence of parenchymal complications. However, most likely due to the more intense mechanical manipulation, vascular complications such as thrombus dislocation, cervical/intracranial dissection and vessel perforation with consecutive SAH are observed. The knowledge of different recanalization approaches and the immediate treatment of vascular complications is often mandatory and lifesaving. Therefore, the training for endovascular stroke treatment has to include the application of various different endovascular stroke treatment approaches as well as techniques to control complications including extra-and intra-cranial stenting and the use of liquid embolic materials.

Another interesting challenge is the fact that this \"clean\" method of sympatholytic therapy makes it possible to study the influence of sympathetic activity on various pathologies. For instance, it has been hypothesized that the interaction between insulin resistance and sympathetic activity might be bidirectional. First results seem to suggest that insulin sensitivity improves considerably after renal denervation, strongly supporting the role of sympathetic hyperactivity in its pathogenesis. Other interesting subjects could be the effect on inflammatory markers and on markers of vascular, renal hemodynamic and cardiac function and structure. Are there any downsides? Obviously, there is concern about a detrimental effect on the anatomy of the renal arteries of this invasive procedure. Careful long-term follow-up of these patients is therefore mandatory. Regeneration of nerve function is very well possible, especially for efferent nerves. Afferent nerves are unlikely to regrow. Any anatomical and functional regeneration will be difficult to diagnose apart from a rise in blood pressure. However, given the above-mentioned pathophysiologic considerations, effects on afferent nerves are likely to be (much) more important, than any effect on efferent nerves. It seems unlikely, that there are unwanted effects with respect to short-term blood pressure regulation, since baroreceptor function is not affected.

            "text": "Recently, the concept of renal denervation experienced a renaissance by the far less side effect prone method of catheter-based renal denervation. Both afferent and efferent renal nerves are located in the wall of the renal artery. The technique of catheterbased renal denervation and first results are recently published and discussed in other presentations (3) (4) (5) . Interestingly, in one patient MSNA, assessed in the peroneal nerve, was reduced after the procedure, providing direct support to the hypothesis that blood pressure lowering is caused by reduction of efferent sympathetic activity from the CNS to the periphery (6). The effect on MSNA after 12 months was even more pronounced than after 1 month. For several reasons these data are potentially of relevance. First, they suggest that a single intervention has an antihypertensive effect lasting for prolonged periods of time, may be even years. Presently, it has only been tested in so-called resistant hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg despite 3 or more antihypertensive agents. Second, given the convincing evidence linking sympathetic hyperactivity to poor clinical outcomes, it will be relevant to quantify the effects on clinical outcomes beyond blood pressure. Third, when data on longer term safety and efficacy of the procedure are available, it will be of interest whether other conditions may also benefit from this intervention, e.g. less severe hypertension, metabolic syndrome/obesity, sleep apnoea, CKD and heart failure. If a prolonged effect is demonstrated, it is likely that the procedure can be (very) cost-effective. There is another reason why the introduction of this procedure is important. It will teach us more about the pathophysiology. The fact that this very localised single intervention has such pronounced systemic effects can only be explained by the pathophysiologic model outlined above and schematically shown in the figure. It will be particularly interesting to study in which patients this intervention is effective and in which it is not and also to work out predictors for the efficacy of the procedure. Given the fact that in experimental models hypertension is prevented by denervation, one might raise the argument why in humans it is only partially reduced. In this context, it is intriguing that available observational data suggest that the effects on blood pressure are increasing over time. It seems attractive to hypothesize that apart from a direct effect of the intervention on blood pressure there may be a second level of efficacy, i.e. the slow reversal of structural vascular and/or renal abnormalities. It seems logical that this takes some time to occur. Another explanation for a partial, instead of (near) total, reduction in blood pressure towards normal level could be that the procedure is only partially effective in destroying the nerves. Variability in efficacy of the denervation procedure itself may also explain the variability of the magnitude of the antihypertensive effect between subjects. From a theoretical point of view, MSNA assessment is the ideal method to evaluate the efficacy of the procedure. Unfortunately, this is unsuitable in every day clinical practice. Further, there are also nerves around the veins and ureters. The precise contribution of these nerves to circulatory functions is unclear. A suitable human \"model\" to test the effects of total renal denervation is unavailable, except for total nephrectomy. Experimental evidence shows that nephrectomy of an injured kidney results in (almost) complete normalisation of blood pressure. Finally, incomplete normalisation of elevated blood pressure may be explained by the assumption that other blood pressure increasing mechanisms may remain operational. It is important to realize that remaining circulating angiotensin II exerts a direct effect on the vasculature as well as on the sympathetic system, the 433 C RSE",

            "text": "With the current Symplicity catheter, a 5 F long sheath is large enough. While it has the advantage of smaller puncture site it carries the risk of dissection when the repeated control angiograms are performed between each shoot. We currently favor the use of 6F guiding catheter (after insertion of a short 6F sheath into the groin). The 2 most useful shapes are LIMA and RDC-1. We choose the shape as follows: in case of sharply descending renal artery a LIMA can be used. In case of relatively horizontal 1 or 2 first cm of the renal artery, an RDC-1 is better suited. There are not many short (45-55cm) 6 F guiding catheter available on the market, and we have generally used the Boston Scientific ones. Permanent flushing of the side port of the sheath/guiding catheter with heparinized saline is recommended. Injection of a bolus 200 mcg of nitroglycerine into each renal artery is recommended in order to reduce spasm. The current version of denervation catheter is of 5F caliber (and can be delivered through a 6F renal guiding catheter) and has a deflecting soft tip. The distal blunt tip carries the electrode that will deliver the radiofrequency current. Once in position into the renal artery, the handle is activated and the tip deflects toward the arterial wall ensuring good wall apposition. A quick angio confirms the position of the tip, and the generator can be activated. A drop in impedance as well a temperature rise will attest the quality of the energy delivery. It is of importance to note however that there are no direct measurements of actual denervation. For control angiograms, most caution should be employed when injecting contrast through the side port. If the distal tip of the sheath/guiding is in close contact with the arterial wall forceful injection of contrast may very easily induce renal artery dissection. After completion of the first 2 minute ablation just proximal to the bifurcation of the renal main, the catheter should be retracted at least 5 mm. The goal is to create an interrupted spiral pattern of 4-6 ablation points. The same process is performed in the contra-lateral renal artery. In some cases, the immediate control angiogram shows small nipples on the arterial wall which are attributed to local edema . They lie at the level of the denervation point and when controlled at mid-term are not visible anymore. Their presence or absence has not been correlated to any positive of negative outcome in these patients. Arterial spasm can be observed and is prevented by injection of nitrates into the renal artery as stated earlier. It is generally mild and does not lead to interruption of the intervention. In case of severe stenosis, the only effective treatment is interruption of the intervention on this side. Permanent caution should be applied to prevent any clot formation during the intervention. We suggest full heparinization using ACT control to ensure and ACT above 200-250. Bolus heparin injection should be performed after femoral puncture. Management of pain and per operative monitoring of the patient ERAD is a painful procedure which usually requires between 30 and 45 min of intervention. Therefore, there is a need for sedation and analgesia. Pain is believed to be related to the heating of vessel adventitia and is usually acute with an on/off pattern, exactly matching the radiofrequency shoots. Patients describe a deep, exquisite lumbar pain, quite similar (or more pronounced) to that reported by those who experience dilatation or dissection of the renal artery. ",

To review the complications and how to avoid them Endovascular renal artery denervation (ERAD) is a new procedure to reduce renal and systemic sympathetic overactivity in hypertensive patients. The only clinically available technique as of mid 2011 is radiofrequency ablation using an endovascular approach. In brief, the symplicity catheter (Medtronic Ardian) is introduced into each renal artery via femoral access. Discrete, low-power, radiofrequency ablations (2 min each) are applied to obtain up to six ablations separated both longitudinally and rotationally within each renal artery. During ablation, the catheter system monitors tip temperature and impedance, altering radiofrequency energy delivery in response to a predetermined algorithm. Because the catheter used has not been validated for use in subtype of anatomical presentation, there is a need of anatomical work up before ERAD. It is recommended, as it was in the inclusion/exclusion criteria of HTN 2 and the initial feasibility cohort to reject from ERAD the following anatomical conditions. Severe renal artery stenosis, renal stent, severe atheromatous aortic lesions, abdominal aortic aneurysms. These situations may not preclude totally the ability to perform the intervention but would require enhanced caution and even more accurate assessment of the risk /benefit ratio. Apart from these situations, the use of symplicity catheter is recommended in renal arteries of \u22654 mm in diameter and 20 mm long before any major branch bifurcation. The technology has not been sufficiently tested in vessels of smaller diameter. The generator is controlled by an algorithm, and the tip of the ablation catheter constantly measures temperature and impedance and will shutoff, if certain thresholds have been reached. Unilateral treatment is technically possible but there is less evidence to recommend this approach. Patients with suboptimal anatomy that excluded them from the randomized arms of the HTN-2 study were treated in a registry. The results of this registry may help us better understand the effect of renal denervation in non-standard anatomies. Because most of these patients have resistant hypertension and according to the accepted rules, renal artery imaging is often available in the patient file. However, it is our experience that recent CTA is the most reliable imaging technique in order to depict accessory arteries, measure length and diameters allowing comprehensive anatomical work up. The use of surface reconstruction coronal MIP and/or curved reformats are very helpful in this setting. Denervation is an interventional procedure to treat a high-risk medical condition. Most of the patients in whom the intervention will be proposed will have macroscopically normal arteries. The intervention is technically easier than renal artery stenting, intra-arterial navigation in healthy arteries does not carry any specific difficulty and entering into the renal artery with a conventional 0.014 or 0.035 wire is not a problem. The different steps of the denervation process are therefore as follows: Femoral artery puncture at the groin, global angiogram to confirm renal artery anatomy (this step can be bypassed if pre-op imaging is recent and reliable and/or if some degree of renal failure is present).",

In the second step, a randomised controlled trial was done in 106 patients with resistant hypertension. Patients were randomly allocated for renal denervation with previous treatment or to maintain previous treatment alone. The primary endpoint was changed in seated office-based measurement of systolic blood pressure at 6 months. In the denervation group the blood pressure was reduced by 32/12 mmHg which they did not differ from baseline in the control group. At 6 months 84% of the patients who underwent denervation had a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more compared to 35% in the control group. In conclusion, renal denervation can safely be used to substantially reduce blood pressure in treatment-resistant hypertension patients. In the third step, the study group extended the cohort from the first study to 153 patients to prove that at two and a half years of follow up the results of the denervation treatment are durable. All these patients too had resistant hypertension. The blood pressure was reduced by 20 /10, 24/11, 25/11, 23/11, 26/14 and 32/14 mmHg at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. There were 3 pseudo-aneurysms and 1 dissection. This study shows that the results obtained with denervation are durable. The 3 studies described above have several limitations. Up to now they have not yet shown that the outcome of these patients improved in hard outcomes measures such as mortality, acute heart disease and stroke. Such outcomes studies have to be done. Second the patient population studied is very limited. It is very well possible that in patients with less severe hypertension and less medication the denervation method could be useful too. In this respect the problem of patient non-adherence to and non-persistence with a lifelong pharmacological therapy for a mainly asymptomatic disease should be addressed and it should be investigated what the contribution of the denervation method could be in a wide range of hypertension patients. In these later studies not only hypertension but also hard long-term outcome measures should be studied. Besides the 3 studies referred here, no other studies on the effect and clinical outcomes are available yet. Relatively high doses of analgesic drugs are sometimes required to control pain and that the best approach is to provide systematic analgesia prior to initiation of noxious stimulation. A good coordination between IR and anaesthesiologist ensures that opioids are administered at least two minutes before turning on the radiofrequency generator. Opioids may then be titrated according to EVA scale in order to optimize patient's comfort. Mild sedation is helpful to enhance patient confidence and facilitate IR's work by reducing stress and movements. On the other hand, the combination of analgesia and sedation carries a risk of respiratory depression that requires careful monitoring. Ideally, conscious sedation should be targeted to obtain a \"modified observer assessment of alertness/ sedation\" (MOAAS) scale of 4 or 3, meaning that the patient remains responsive to verbal stimulation.",

In the first step, the proof of principle and safety was shown in a cohort study of 50 patients with 1-year follow up. The patients had resistant hypertension with systolic blood pressure \u2265 160 mmHg on three or more antihypertensive medications including a diuretic. Five patients were excluded for the presence of a dual renal artery system. Blood pressure was reduced by 14/10, 21/10, 22/11, 24/11 and 27/17 mmHg at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

            "text": "Infrapopliteal angioplasty is becoming the gold standard procedure for treatment of below-the-knee arterial disease. Compared to surgery this minimally invasive procedure shows a clear benefit of shorter hospital stays and reduced complications and periprocedural adverse events, especially in the frail patient cohort of elderly patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). In addition, percutaneous angioplasty provides the opportunity to treat lesions in multiple tibial arteries during the same procedure or in a staged manner, whereas surgical revascularization is generally restricted to bypass a single tibial target. Outcome data of percutaneous revascularization for the treatment of infrapopliteal disease suffer from many of the limitations of the observational surgical series in that they typically analyze retrospectively relatively small number of patients at individual centers. There is also inadequate information regarding the anatomy of the lesions treated. The duration of follow-up in endovascular studies is also significantly shorter compared with surgical series, in part due to the continuous evolution of endovascular therapy. Comparison across studies is problematic due to differences in baseline clinical characteristics and differing complexity of anatomic disease. Comparison with surgical series is also difficult, since the spectrum of patients treated using endovascular techniques is different from those treated using surgical bypass. In patients with CLI the primary goal of treatment is typically prevention of amputation and salvage of a functioning limb. Reported results for infrapopliteal PTA usually focus on these outcomes with limb-salvage rates of 56-91%. In a large meta-analysis of series (including older ones) using PTA as the primary treatment modality, Romiti et al reported a limb salvage rate of 82.4% at 3 years, which is comparable with that of 82.3% reported in a meta-analysis by Albers et al of popliteal-to-distal bypass using similar methodology. Interestingly, this comparative clinical efficacy was achieved despite significantly lower primary and secondary patency rates in the PTA series. Both intraluminal and subintimal angioplasty can equally be used when treating patients with critical limb ischemia. Subintimal angioplasty is a valuable solution for long tibioperoneal occlusions. A large meta-analysis by Bown et al of over 2800 patients who had subintimal angioplasty for critical limb ischemia showed a limb salvage rate of 89.3%. In another large systematic review by Met et al of over 1500 patients who were treated with subintimal angioplasty a limb salvage rate of 80 to 90% was achieved. Infrapopliteal stenting is indicated as a bail-out procedure in treating intimal dissections and abolishing elastic recoil of the vessel wall with maximum early luminal gain. Feiring et al. were the first who documented the safety and efficacy of infrapopliteal stent placement. They applied primary below-the-knee stent-supported angioplasty for restoring straight inline arterial flow in patients with infrapopliteal arterial disease. Bare or heparin-coated balloon-expandable stents were mainly used without any serious adverse events. The authors reported 1-year outcomes after primary infrapopliteal stent placement in 92 limbs suffering from either CLI (68%) or lifestyle-limiting claudication (32%). Technical success was 94% for de novo atherosclerotic lesions; clinical amelioration of CLI was achieved in 96% of the cases, with sustained clinical improvement at 1 year.",

Although improved limb salvage remains the cornerstone endpoint for evaluation of all new infrapopliteal instruments and technologies, inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia by drug-eluting stents plausibly leads to improved vessel patency and sustained clinical improvement as reflected by the significantly improved Rutherford-Becker classification and reduced events of target lesion revascularization due to recurrent CLI. In contrary to drug-eluting stents that require permanent metal vessel scaffolding, the concept of drugeluting balloons involves delivery of a payload of antirestenotic drug during balloon inflation in order to achieve high concentration in the vessel wall and inhibit neointimal hyperplasia while avoiding any systemic toxicity. Currently available drug-eluting balloon platforms deliver dry-state paclitaxel that is deposited on the balloon surface at a dose of 3\u03bcg/mm2.

To learn which implication the study results should have on clinical practice Critical limb ischemia (CLI) entails a high risk of major amputation without prompt and aggressive revascularization. Wolfe et al. classically described the poor prognosis of CLI in more than 6000 patients. If left untreated, CLI caused major amputation in 73% of patients with rest pain and in 95% of patients with tissue loss at 1 year. In the interest of prevention of limb loss, patients with CLI are candidates for revascularization attempts by surgical or percutaneous methods. Although infrainguinal bypass surgery remains the cornerstone of CLI treatment, the majority of the patients are ineligible because of diffuse infrapopliteal arterial occlusions, absence of suitable vein grafts, and multiple underlying comorbidities. Compared to surgery, angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure with a clear benefit of reduced complications and periprocedural adverse events, especially in the frail patient cohort of elderly octogenarians. In addition, it may be repeated as necessary, and more than 1 vessel to the foot may be recanalized. The primary goal of infrapopliteal angioplasty is to restore at least 1 straight line of blood flow to the distal foot. The secondary objective is to preserve the patency of the treated lesion for as long as possible to avoid recurrence of CLI symptoms. In the majority of the cases, infrapopliteal angioplasty may be combined with more proximal femoropopliteal endovascular procedures. Occasionally, it may be applied in tight distal anastomotic lesions of bypass grafts to avoid early graft failure and thrombosis. Reported complication rates range from 3 to 11% and include puncture site hematomas, vessel perforation, dissection, and distal embolism or thrombosis, which may be successfully managed endovascularly. The reported 30-day mortality rate of infrapopliteal angioplasty is <1.7%. Scientific evidence regarding safety and overall clinical effectiveness of infrapopliteal angioplasty supports its application as a first-line treatment option for infrapopliteal obstructive arterial disease in the setting of CLI. The FIRE (Foundation for Interventional Radiology in Europe) registry organized by the Cardiovascular Interventional Radiology Society of Europe enrolled 396 patients with 409 critically ischemic limbs. An 83% cumulative limb salvage rate and a 91% cumulative survival rate were achieved after a mean follow-up period of almost 6 months. Univariate analysis within the FIRE registry showed that cardiac disease, carotid disease, and renal insufficiency were unfavorably associated with both mortality and limb salvage. A random effects meta-regression analysis of 18 studies published between 1984 and 1997 and including 1280 patients treated with infrapopliteal balloon angioplasty reported overall limb salvage rates of 79% at 1 year and 74% after 2 years. A more recent meta-analysis of 30 studies published between 1990 and 2006 reported 3-year limb salvage and patient survival probabilities of 82.4 and 68.4%, respectively. For comparison, the 5-year limb salvage rates using autogenous veins for infrapopliteal bypass range from 73 to 81%. The enthusiastic results of drug-eluting stents in the coronary arteries were the impetus for their widespread application in other vascular territories, including but not limited to the intracranial arteries, the renal arteries and the infrainguinal arteries. A systematic review of the literature analyzing outcomes of stenting below-theknee in 18 non-randomized studies, including 640 patients in total, C RSE (PVE) is accepted as a useful procedure in the preoperative treatment of patients selected for major hepatic resection. PVE redirects portal flow to the intended future remnant liver (FRL) to induce hypertrophy of the nondiseased portion of the liver and thereby may reduce complications and shorten hospital stays after surgery. Patients with a future liver remnant (FLV) estimated to be less than 25% of the total estimated liver volume (TELV) are more likely to develop postoperative hepatic failure. PVE is indicated in patients if the FLR/TELV is less than 25%. The aim of the PVE is to cause hypertrophy so the FLR exceeds 25% of the TELV permitting safer hepatic resection. In patients with underlying compromised liver function a ratio 40% FLV/TELV is desirable. Preprocedural liver volumes FLV and TELV are calculated from CT or MR volumetric data. The estimation of TELV may also be based on the patient's weight and estimated body surface area. Patients who are considered to be potential candidates for surgical resection are very unlikely to have any comorbidities that are contraindications for PVE. In patients with biliary dilatation, biliary drainage is recommended. Any coagulopathy should be corrected prior to PVE. PVE is typically performed 4-6 weeks prior to surgical resection. Some patients require a two-staged hepatic resection or combine hepatic resection with tumour ablation techniques to achieve a disease-free FLR. PVE is more likely to be required in cases where staged resection or tumour ablation is required. PVE is a well tolerated procedure, it has a low complication rate (minor<5% and major <1%) and a high technical success rate >95%. Following technically successful PVE patients may not have surgical resection 30-40%. The two most common causes for no subsequent hepatic resection following technically successful PVE are: disease progression (identification of extrahepatic spread, involvement of the FLR or involvement of the portal vein of the FLR) or a failure to achieve FLR/TELV > 25% post-PVE. The presence of systemic disease such as diabetes mellitus may limit hepatic hypertrophy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of PVE on the metastasis rate of growth with some evidence to suggest the growth of the metastasis can be accelerated post-PVE, which could potentially cause disease progression resulting in the patient no longer being resectable. The role of chemotherapy combined with PVE prior to resection is unclear but is likely to further increase the number of patients considered suitable for surgical resection. The number of patients who undergo hepatic resection for malignant disease has increasing and consequently there is also increasing demand for PVE prior to surgery.",

The first group consists in proximal occlusion with passive material such as coils or vascular plugs. 2. The second group is distal embolization with passive embolic material like spherical or non-spherical particles, or fibrin glue or gelfoam. 3. The latter group consists in N-butyl-cyanoacrylate, onyx or alcohol direct injection. This group has en embolic effect but also induces an inflammatory reaction around the embolic material in the portal spaces. There is no randomized trial comparing groups of patients using the same inclusion criteria to compare which embolic material is the most efficient. However, large cohort studies have shown that the latest group seems to be more efficient in term of regeneration. This also has been demonstrated from experimental animal studies that have shown that N-butyl-cyanoacrylate or alcohol is the most powerful embolic agent to induce significant regeneration. In case of hepatocellular carcinoma, portal vein embolization can be done two weeks after arterial embolization of the tumors, in the same segments. There is no described risk of liver ischemia and the association of arterial and portal subsequent embolization seems to provide better results in term of regeneration as compared to portal vein embolization alone. Complications of portal vein embolization and during the first days after PVE are rare and mainly observed in patients with portal hypertension, cirrhosis or chronic liver disease. The expected rate of regeneration is between 40 and 80% for patients with healthy liver and is reduced in patients with cirrhosis, depending on the fibrosis core of the liver, four to six weeks after portal vein embolization. Another CT volumetry is performed to confirm liver regeneration after embolization. It allows showing if the threshold of 40 or 30% is achieved after portal vein embolization and permits a major resection. Studies comparing survivals of patients who had portal vein embolization before surgery did not show any difference as compared to patients without portal vein embolization. This clearly states that portal vein embolization allows more patients to be treated with a curative intent, mainly for patients with multiple liver metastasis. Portal vein embolization can also be combined in the same procedure to radiofrequency ablation of lesions localized in the future remnant liver, which allows treating by a combination of PVE, RFA and surgery patients with bilobar one percutaneous procedure and one surgical extensive hepatectomy. The incidence of complications related to portal vein embolization (PVE) is usually reported in the range from 0 to 15% although many of these complications are minor and do not prevent subsequent liver resection (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) .

Major hepatectomy carries a risk of major complications and mortality which is directly related to the liver volume left in place after surgery. In order to extend indications of major hepatectomy to patients who were not candidate to resection because of an insufficient future remnant liver volume, interventional techniques appeared such as portal vein embolization (PVE). PVE is a technique of embolization which occludes portal branches of the liver that will be ultimately resected. Portal branches of the future remnant liver are left opened and all the portal flow is redirected towards these patent branches. The sudden increase in portal flow and the presence of hepatotrophic factors stimulate regeneration of the future remnant liver. The future remnant liver increases in volume rapidly within four to six weeks allowing surgery to be done. Indications of portal vein embolization vary depending on the liver parenchyma status and to the planed hepatectomy. This also means that a precise evaluation of the liver status sometimes necessitates healthy liver biopsy as well as a precise volumetry of different segments of the liver has to be done in order to take the decision to perform PVE. Liver volumetry is performed by a multiphasic CT after injection of contrast media. Different volumes are obtained such as the total liver volume, the total functional liver which is a total volume minus the volume of the liver tumors and the future remnant liver volume which is the volume of the expected liver to be left in place after surgery. This also needs precise collaboration between surgeons and radiologists to decide which part of the liver will be resected and what will precisely be left in place. In patients with healthy liver, it has been demonstrated that there is no significant difference in post-operative morbidity and mortality when the future remnant is over 20% of the functional liver. Under this threshold, surgery is considered at risk and indication of portal vein embolization established. This threshold of 20% also depends on the liver status and patients who have received multiple courses of chemotherapy as well as patients with steatosis need more liver volume after surgery to have a safe resection. Patients with cirrhosis mainly with F4 fibrosis are considered at high risk such as patients with chronic biliary obstruction and patients with cholangiocarcinoma. In the later group ratio over 40% is mandatory to allow surgery. Different techniques of portal embolization have been described in the literature. Most of the procedures are performed percutaneously and two portal vein accesses have been described: 1. The first one being called the ipsilateral technique, meaning that the right portal branches are approached under ultrasound guidance and subsequently embolized. 2. The contralateral approach means that the left portal branches are punctured in order to embolize the right portal branches. The first technique eliminates the risk of left liver lesion during the puncture phase but it makes also impossible the use of N-butylcyanoacrylate for embolization and it makes also more complex to obtain portography at the end of the procedure since the catheter is passed through the embolic material. The left portal vein approach or contralateral technique makes catheterism easier but carries a risk of complications during the puncture phase like hematoma, portal vein dissection or hemobilia. These complications are rare but must be known before the procedure. Almost all the embolic materials have been used for portal vein embolization but they can be divided into 3 groups of embolic 439 C RSE",

Choice of access, ipsilateral or contralateral, is often mentioned in discussion about avoiding complications. Theoretically contralateral access through the FLR should be riskier. Damage occurring during ipsilateral access should be less significant since that portion of liver will ultimately be removed. For example, while peri-catheter thrombus formation in the portal vein is certainly a possibility, it becomes a non-issue when the catheter is in the vein you are intending to embolize. Also, since the tract enters into the embolized vein one could theorize that there would be a slight decrease in the chance of bleeding out the tract. However, Kodama et al (4) showed no difference in the complication rates between ipsilateral and contralateral access. Similarly, a large series of PVE done from a contralateral approach (1) had virtually identical complications rates when compared to a large series of ipsilateral PVE cases (12) . Even the rate of non-target embolization was comparable and low with each technique. Kodama et al (4) did note that complications were much higher when access was achieved through the posterior segment than anterior segments.

This should be very rare, especially with ultrasound guidance, but it has been reported in 1 case out of cohort of 46 patients (4). Often complications are mild self-limiting symptoms with the most common being pain or fever (7). True post-embolization syndrome is rare since there is little inflammation and usually no necrosis associated with PVE; however, mild fever has been reported in as many as 36% of patients (9) . Other mild symptoms that have rarely been reported include ileus and nausea. Given the vascularity of the liver, bleeding complications are not unexpected. Of these, subcapsular hematoma is most commonly reported at a rate of 3-4% (4) (5) . Arterial complications including arterial puncture, pseudoaneurysm, and hemobilia have all been described and are managed the same way they would be if they occurred during a biliary case. Necrosis of a segment of liver resulting from concomitant arterial injury during PVE has also been reported (10) . Transient liver failure occurs infrequently, for example in 6 patients out of 188 (3%) in Di Stefano's series (1). It is usually manifested by an increase in the liver function tests although jaundice has rarely been reported. The main problem is the acute portal hypertension that sometimes accompanies this. Some patients have developed ascites and others variceal bleeding as a result of the acute portal hypertension. Nagino et al (11) reported a case of acute hypersplenism, including splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, along with ascites that developed within 2 to 3 weeks after PVE even though the liver pathology showed mild fibrosis and no cirrhosis. Thrombosis of the main portal vein is one of the worst complications that can occur. There are several potential mechanisms of this. If there is extensive non-target embolization into the future liver remnant (FLR), then overall portal flow can be reduced enough to lead to thrombosis. Secondly, if the patient has underlying portal hypertension, portal flow may already be compromised and PVE further slows portal flow and may precipitate thrombosis of the main portal vein. Main portal vein thrombosis fortunately is rare but when it does happen it often eliminates the chance of having the planned surgical liver resection.",

Several steps can be taken to avoid bleeding complications. Any coagulopathy should be corrected before the procedure. Ultrasound is used in many centers to guide the portal vein puncture. This should decrease the overall number of needle passes needed since it is not a blind technique. It should also facilitate access into a more appropriate peripheral portal branch. Ultrasound can also help choose a safe access route.

            "text": "Imagerie digestive -urgences, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France. The local ablative effects of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU(S)) were described first in the 1940s and 1950s. However, the interest in this technique was then low for several decades till the 1990s when new communications on image-guided HIFU were presented. The ablative effect in HIFU is based on the local concentration of acoustic waves, which are concentrated (focused) -comparable to light passing through a burning glass -by an acoustic lens. Technically, this lens can be realized by a spherically arranged transducer system, acoustic lenses, parabolic reflection, or \"direct manipulation\" of the acoustic waves by phase-controlled transducer elements. In consequence, a focal energy density of 1.000 -to 10.000W/ cm2 (for comparison: energy density of diagnostic US waves: 0.1 -0.5 W/cm2) can be gained. The acoustic energy is absorbed by the tissue resulting in a focal temperature elevation within seconds called sonication, mainly caused by frictional heat. The size of the volume of sonication compares to the size of a rice grain. To destroy larger volumes many sonications have to be applied and arranged in such a way that the target tissue is completely \"covered\" by the sonication spots. Prior to the treatment session a diagnostic screening MRI of the pelvis including sagittal and axial T2 weighted turbo spin-echo as well as T1 weighted turbo spin-echo sequences before and after contrast injection should be performed. Based on these images the number, size, location and well as the signal intensity before and after contrast are determined. An optimal candidate for a HIFU treatment should not show more than 3 fibroids, with a maximum diameter of less than 10 cm. The distance from the body surface to the center of the fibroid should be less than 12 cm without any scars, bowel loops or bones within the beam path and no critical structures, e.g. nerves too close to the focus area. Additionally, the fibroids should show a homogenous low signal intensity on T2 weighted sequences and a homogenous contrast enhancement. The procedure can be performed an on an outpatient basis. For the HIFU treatment patients are positioned lying prone on the MRI table and the anterior wall of the pelvis is acoustically coupled to the device by a gel pad and degassed water. A surface coil is placed on the patients back for signal reception and the table is advanced into the magnet positioning the pelvis in the isocenter of the scanner. Thereafter, T2 weighted sequences are acquired and transferred to HIFU planning systems. The operating interventionalist selects a fibroid to be treated and delineates the treatment area, which is filled with treatment cells thereafter. The cells showing a diameter from 4 to 16 mm and a length of 10 to 40 mm are positioned within the fibroid until the entire desired volume is covered. Thereafter, the cells are sonicated in rapid succession under realtime temperature control using a dedicated MRI sequence and the proton resonance frequency (PRF) method. Depending on the cell size sonication takes 20-70 seconds followed by a short waiting time to avoid heating beyond the focus area. Depending on the time required for patient positioning and treatment planning as well as the number and size of the fibroids, the duration of the treatment typically ranges from 2 to 4 hours. However, recently introduced volumetric ablation techniques using feedback cells have shown to speed up the procedure. Finally, the extent of the successfully treated area can be measured on T1-weighted sequences after contrast injection delineating the non-perfused volume. The HIFU treatment typically does not cause any pain requiring medication and the patients can leave the hospital a few hours after the end of the treatment. Although some patients show pain relief after HIFU treatments including only 20-30% of the fibroid's volume several study have shown that larger non-perfused volumes improve patient's outcome. Therefore, we always aim to treat as much of the fibroid as technically possible a reasonable treatment time. Several studies have shown that the extent of the non-perfused volume immediately after the HIFU treatment predicts fibroid volume reduction at 12-month follow-up. ",

            "text": "Over the past 5 decades, the treatment of breast cancer has evolved from highly invasive radical mastectomies to breast-conserving therapy that allows women to avoid severe disfigurement and related morbidity while providing equivalent survival benefit. More recently, the approach for nodal staging has also become less invasive with the adoption of sentinel lymph node biopsy as the current standard of care for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Continuing with this trend toward minimally invasive therapy, various ablative techniques have been studied for the treatment of breast cancer. Both thermal and cold techniques have been evaluated as potential treatment modalities. RFA, laser therapy, HIFU, and MW result in tumor destruction from significant heating of the tissue. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a highly precise and completely non-invasive thermal therapy using focused ultrasound energy for burning and destroying the tumor tissue at depth within the body, selectively and without harming overlying and adjacent structures within the path of the beam. HIFU can be used to reach tumoral areas that are deep within the body, if there is an acoustic window for allowing for the transmission of ultrasound energy. HIFU has been applied in several clinical situations, being studied in the ablation of breast fibroadenomas and carcinomas. Preliminary reports underline a reduced toxicity with HIFU ablation compared with other ablation techniques because of the non-invasive nature of the procedure. Extracorporeal devices are used most commonly for intra-abdominal solid tumors by mean of transducers with a long focal length and both Ultrasound or MRI for targeting the organ. Background The JC HIFU system (which has been installed since 2007 at IEO) is an extracorporeal device using a 20-cm-diameter plane lead-zirconate-titanate disc transducers with an aluminium alloy lens with focal length of 16 cm, driven at 0.8 MHz. It operates at relatively high intensities up to 20,000 W/cm2. The imaging probe is located in the centre of the high-intensity focused ultrasound transducer allowing for real-time US image monitoring during treatment. Ultrasound is a form of vibrational wave which penetrates through soft tissues and can be focused with the described spherically curved transducer to target sites that represents the Acoustic Focal Region (AFR). Guidance and monitoring of acoustic therapy is most important",

To discuss new and expanded applications of focused US High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an ablative tool that can be applied to many different clinical applications. It has advantages over other ablation tools in that it can deliver high energy through tissue to a target without harming intervening tissue. Ultrasound causes tissue damage through two primary mechanisms: conversion of mechanical energy into heat and cavitation. It is important to consider the local tissue environment and content through which the beam passes, because they have an important effect on the ultimate achieved temperature at the desired focus. Heterogeneous tissue can cause sound wave reflections that interrupt the beam or divert the focused energy to a slightly different location than theoretically predicted. For example, HIFU has limitations of ultrasound waves penetrating bone and gas. This makes focusing energy through the skull, for example, a significant challenge. It also makes procedures without an acoustic window due to bowel gas particularly challenging. HIFU can rapidly elevate the temperature at the focus to above 80oC leading to cell death in under a second of exposure. The volume of ablation following a single HIFU sonication is generally small and usually cigar shaped measuring approximately 1-3mm x 8-15mm. Therefore, several adjacent HIFU sonications are required in order to ablate a larger volume. Cavitation is less predictable and is based on the principle that ultrasound waves subjects the tissue molecular tissue to alternating cycles of compression and rarefaction during which gas can be drawn out of solution, creating bubbles. These bubbles oscillate in size and, ultimately, might collapse causing local energy release. Thus, the final tissue lesion is generated by a combination of mechanical stress and heat. When coupled to an MR scanner, the heat delivered by HIFU can be measured with MR thermometry techniques. Non-invasive threedimensional temperature maps are feasible with MRI and may be based on the T1 relaxation time, the diffusion coefficient, or proton resonance frequency (PRF) of tissue water. The PRF method is most frequently employed and uses fast spoiled gradient-recalled-echo sequences. The MR images during the ultrasound sonication are compared to images obtained immediately before that sonication, the changes in those images can be calibrated to generate a realtime feedback temperature mapping during the entire procedure, ensuring that the thermal ablation is located in the previous determined target while avoiding damage to the surrounding critical tissues. By initially using a lower level of HIFU energy, one can detect a small temperature elevation before providing the full energy level that would cause irreversible damage. This type of safety mechanism is employed in clinical MR-guided HIFU systems. Clinically, HIFU has been most commonly applied to uterine fibroids. It has also been used to treat bone pain from metastatic lesions, focal prostate cancers, focal breast lesions, and liver cancers. Some of the more unusual applications have been creating non-invasive vasectomy, treating atrial fibrillation, arterial puncture closure for hemostasis, and focal delivery of genes. In this lecture we will explore some of the research that has been done in non-traditional applications of HIFU.",

Between 1 and 6 weeks from the HIFU treatment, patients underwent conserving surgery associated with sentinel lymph-node biopsy or complete axillary dissection, if the sentinel lymph-node was metastatic. Macroscopic observation of surgical specimen showed the ablated tumour gray-white or gray-yellow in colour and felt firm on palpation. There was no evidence of haemorrhage in the central region of the treated lesion.

Real-time imaging, such as ultrasound, ensures that HIFU beam targeting is maintained within the correct area throughout the procedure. Sonographic guidance provides the benefit of using the same form of energy that is being used for therapy. The significance of this is that the acoustic window can be verified with sonography. Imaging methods to assess HIFU treatment are similar to those used to assess the response to other methods of ablation such as radiofrequency ablation and include contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. In addition, the use of micro-bubbles ultrasound contrast-enhanced is also being examined as a method for evaluating efficacy of HIFU treatment. PET scan is another diagnostic tool currently used for oncologic applications it is used for assessing changes in metabolic activity after HIFU treatment. Several mechanisms are involved in the tissue damage induced by HIFU. Localized heat generation due to absorption of the acoustic energy is the main biological effect in tissues. The heat rapidly raises high temperatures at the AFR from 55\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, causing coagulation necrosis. The precise and well delimited US focusing minimizes the potential thermal damage to the tissue located along the acoustic pathway, because the energy is much lower outside the focal region. Mechanical phenomena, in addition to thermal effects, are associated only at high energies. Cavitation can be defined as the creation or motion of gas bubbles within an acoustic field due to alternating compression and expansion of tissue as ultrasound waves propagate through it. It seems difficult to distinguish the thermal effects from either acoustic cavitation or vessel damage in HIFU ablation. Actually, they can occur simultaneously within the targeted tissue. Therefore, the coagulation necrosis induced by HIFU can be considered as the result of biological effects from a combination of heat, cavitation and vascular destruction on tissue. Combination between imaging and technologies for local therapy has made ablative procedures more reliable and practical, allowing for safe and feasible application of HIFU treatments in clinical practice. US-guided extracorporeal HIFU has been recently used to treat patients with various kinds of malignancies, including liver, breast, kidney, bone, and soft tissue both in Asia and Europe. Investigation and applications of HIFU are growing rapidly worldwide.

To become familiar with the literature about ovarian artery embolization The ovarian artery is a common secondary supply to the uterus, especially when large fundal fibroids are present or there has been previous pelvic surgery or uterine artery embolization. In one study, abdominal aortography prior to uterine artery embolization demonstrated ovarian collateral supply in 25% although their detection influenced treatment in only 6% (Binkert et al 2001) . The ovarian arteries are paired structures which usually arise from the anterior aspect of the abdominal aorta between the level of the origin of the renal arteries and the inferior mesenteric artery. In approximately 25% of cases, one of the ovarian arteries arises from the renal artery. Each artery runs obliquely behind the peritoneum inferiorly and laterally to the pelvic brim where it turns medially to enter the suspensory ligament of the ovary. However, as the role of the ovarian artery in supplying fibroids is increasingly recognised With regard to technique, it has been recommended that embolization is performed distal to the ovary to avoid ovarian dysfunction in premenopausal women (Andrews et al 2000) . This is difficult to achieve even with a microcatheter as the artery is extremely tortuous, may not be hyertrophied and spasm easily induced, so embolization is often performed from a proximal position using particles. Reflux into the aorta is a particular concern if the catheter cannot be advanced very far into the artery. Retrograde reflux into the aorta from embolization into the uterine arteries can also occur in the presence of a large utero-ovarian anastomosis. Embolization of the ovarian arteries is required if they are shown to be supplying the fibroid and >90% infarction is to be achieved. Utero-ovarian anastomoses have been shown to be associated with higher rates of intervention after UAE (Kim et al 2008) . An ovarian arterial supply of >10% of the fibroid load is considered to warrant ovarian artery embolization (Scheurig-Muenkler et al 2010) . This is identified by means of MR angiography (Mori et al 2010) or during the procedure if a defect is identified in the contrast opacified uterine contour during fluoroscopy. Flush aortography is necessary to confirm this at the time of the procedure but is not advocated as a routine in an effort to reduce radiation doses (Pelage et al 2003) . Even when it is confirmed that the ovarian arteries are a significant source of supply to the fibroids, ovarian artery embolization is avoided in younger women who desire fertility due to the concern that embolization may adversely affect ovarian reserve. There is very limited evidence about the effect of ovarian artery embolization on ovarian reserve and permanent amenorrhoea.",

To become familiar with the internet as a communication and marketing tool This lecture is given from the perspective of a physician practicing in the competitive, fee-for service USA system. Some of the specifics of execution will differ from region to region based on the structure of medical practice. Growing a fibroid embolization practice requires actions along a number of different fronts. The first is practice marketing to increase referrals. There are 3 targets for marketing -the public (patients), gynecologists with whom IR competes for treatment of fibroids, and gynecologists (or other physicians) with whom the IR does not compete for treatment of fibroids. Patient education can include a vast array of activities. Information brochures about the procedure should be made available to patients. These can be placed in the IR office and in the Radiology waiting areas (especially ultrasound and MRI). They can also be placed in the offices of referring physicians (both primary care and Ob/Gyn). If permissible within the medical system, advertisements can be placed in popular magazines or in public spaces. A public information seminar, properly advertised, can yield a room full of potential patients eager to hear about treatments for fibroid disease. Such a seminar can also build one's relationship with a referring Gyn by asking him or her to be a speaker at this seminar. A gynecologist who has an office-only practice and does not perform surgeries is a natural ally for the IR. These physicians have a choice of referring fibroid patients to IR for UAE, or to another gynecologist who does surgery. In the latter case, they risk never seeing the patient again. The same dynamic holds for non-gynecologists who provide basic Gyn care. In the USA many family practitioners do this. Gynecologists who treat fibroids surgically are the most difficult to win over to referring patients for embolotherapy, since UAE directly competes with their own practice. In these situations the IR has to show expertise in patient management and case selection for UAE, as well as be familiar with the fibroid treatments that Gyns provide in order to have a productive conversation. The emphasis in building relationships with these physicians has to be on ensuring that patients are fully informed of their options for treatment, regardless of who provides the treatment. Ideally there should be cooperation between IR and Gyn, providing a team approach to care. This would include an attempt to offer each patient the treatment or treatments that are best for her as an individual (so far as that can be determined). The second issue is communication with the referring physicians. Every patient encounter should result in a note of some sort that must be sent to the referring physician. This keeps them aware of the patient's progress, and also demonstrates both the quality of care provided and the dedication of the IR to providing quality ongoing care. The third is providing high-quality patient care. This is not limited to technical expertise, but includes pre-procedure and post-procedure care. One of the things that is most likely to result in referrals being ",

To learn about the endovascular treatment options Prerequisite for hemodialysis is a functional vascular access. Whereas in the US many patients are dialyzed via catheters, in Europe the majority of patients is provided with AV-shunts. Placement of autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistulas is preferred over prosthetic grafts as they are associated with a lower incidence of death and accessrelated complications such as hematoma, pseudoaneurysms, and infection, as well as having a higher primary and secondary patency rate (1) . AV fistulas typically require one to three months to \"mature.\" While KDOQI recommends fistula placement six months prior to the initiation of dialysis (2), this is widely not the case for a variety of reasons. Fistula maturation requires adequate arterial inflow, adequate venous outflow, and the ability of the vein to dilate to increase blood flow enough to allow repetitive cannulation for dialysis. The three main reasons for maturation failure are: arterial and venous problems and the presence of accessory veins (3, 4) . Vascular mapping before arteriovenous fistula creation has been shown to result in decrease of non-matured arteriovenous fistulae. For optimal results, both arterial and venous evaluation is required for fistula creation (5) . The identification of delayed or missing maturation is not very complex: beside physical examination as the basis of every fistula evaluation there is ultrasonography and fistulography. During the physical examination any visible large venous branches should be noted. If there is doubt over the suitability of the fistula, a duplex ultrasound is very helpful. Ultrasound can determine vein diameter, areas of stenosis, significant accessory veins, and blood flow. A draining vein <4 mm in diameter and a blood flow <500 ml/min indicate a fistula that is unlikely to mature in more than two-thirds of patients without some type of intervention. Knowing the nature and location of the lesion is essential for adequate diagnostic fistulography puncture allowing therapeutic intervention in the same setting. Any fistula that fails to mature adequately and demonstrates abnormal physical findings should be studied aggressively and abnormalities that are detected should be corrected before a plan to create a new access is made. Two different types of therapy can be offered: endovascular and surgical.",

Hemodialysis shunts of the arms are another frequent cause. The changed physiology of venous flow is suspected to be the cause, but the underlying mechanism is not clearly understood. If central venous stenosis is suspected ultrasound is an easy available screening tool. But for complete evaluation of the central venous system either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used and usually give a better overview compared to venography by catheter angiography. The latter however offers the advantage of direct interventional treatment options and is therefore still considered the gold standard by some interventionalists. Since easy availability of CT and because CT offers the advantage of simultaneous and easy staging of malignant disease, I deem computed tomography to be the gold standard for initial diagnosis. The contrast material should be injected via the affected side (or simultaneously from both sides). A first pass scan followed by a late venous phase scan 100-180 s after contrast injection should be performed. Using MRI there are no restrictions concerning radiation exposure, which makes it ideal for follow up. Technically, multiple phases after contrast material injection can be acquired, until sufficient contrast enhancement in all veins is seen. In case of malignant SVC or IVC syndrome the primary placement of stents has shown excellent results. But it has to be considered that there are no data on long-term patency of these stents.

To present the possible mechanisms of hand ischaemia and its diagnosis 3. To present the techniques of treatment and results The clinical problem Dialysis access-associated upper extremity ischemia is a serious complication that may lead to major amputation. The risk of symptomatic ischemia is below 2% in forearm fistulas but ranges from 5 to 15% in elbow accesses (1) . However, due to the increasing age and proportions of diabetics in incident dialysis patients, this is a growing problem. There are 3 mechanisms interacting in the development of hand ischemia: lesions of the feeding arteries, the steal of the fistula on the arterial supply to the hand and sometimes venous stagnation or hypertension (2) (3) . The absolute priority is to rule out stenosis or occlusion of a major artery that might be easily accessible to PTA (4). Mild to moderate symptoms of digital ischemia are common immediately after construction of a dialysis fistula, but in most cases symptoms resolve with development of collateral flows. Chronic ischemic syndrome will develop and worsen if residual flow to the hand is insufficient to maintain basic metabolic needs of soft tissues (5) . Unfortunately, the diagnosis of hand ischemia is often overlooked and delayed by dialysis nurses and nephrologists who monitor or treat the fistula and not the hand. A 1-4 scale of classification for access-induced ischemia can be used to outline the severity of the disease (grade 1= pale/blue and/or cold hand with no pain, grade 2= pain during exercise and/or dialysis, grade 3= ischemic pain at rest, grade 4= ulceration, necrosis and gangrene). For grade 1, conservative treatment is possible most of the time. For grade 2, imaging is indicated at least to search for an arterial stenosis treatable by dilation. For grades 3 and 4, interventional treatment is indicated (6) . Steal syndrome is likely to disappear if the access is ligated, but creation of a new arteriovenous access on another extremity also carries a significant risk of recurring peripheral ischemia. Correction of steal syndrome must therefore be attempted, the aim being both to preserve the access and to improve distal arterial supply to the hand (6) (7) .",

            "text": "Clinical diagnosis is easy at the stage of skin ulceration. In the pain stages, non-invasive testing with measurement of digital pressure, calculation of the digit-to-brachial index (DBI) are important steps. Any decrease indicates insufficient arterial supply. As for the lower limbs, stages 3 and 4 occur when digital arterial pressures are below 50 mmHg and digit/brachial index below 0.6. Under compression of the vascular access, which is not easy in all cases, these respective values rise significantly. These tests show high sensitivity but a poor specificity. However, they help to distinguish steal syndrome from other conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, calciphylaxis (local acute formation of calcium concretions), destructive arthropathy, algodystrophy. Ultrasound examination of all the arteries of the entire limb with vascular access flow-rate measurement is a preliminary compulsory stage in the decision-making process. In experienced hands, US examination can provide the diagnosis of significant arterial stenoses and indicates the direction of the flow in the artery distal to the anastomosis. The measurement of fistula flow rate is essential to the surgical strategy. Magnetic resonance angiography with gadolinium injection is not a patency rates after central venous stenting have to be kept in mind. In patients first presenting with clinical signs of SVC syndrome and showing a mass to be responsible for this, a histological diagnosis should be acquired before deciding on treatment. Of course this depends to some degree on the gravity of the clinical situation. Balloon expandable as well as self expanding stents of different brands have been used for treatment of SVC syndrome due to malignant disease. Self-expandable stents will be used nowadays, because they do not carry the risk of being permanently crushed by external forces. The stent length should be chosen to overlap the central venous stenosis by at least 10 mm on both sides when possible. In case of SVC syndrome it will usually suffice to place one stent extending in to one brachiocephalic vein. But placement of one stent in each brachiocephalic vein with both stents extending into the SVC is possible. In case of benign central venous stenosis PTA is the preferred method over stenting. Balloon sizing should try to achieve an overdilation of 10% to 20% compared to the neighbouring normal vessel diameter. The primary patency rates have been reported to be comparable, but there was a significantly better secondary patency rate for PTA over primary stenting. In case of elastic stenosis stenting might be warranted, but should not be the first choice. It has to be kept in mind that there are many collaterals available. Consequently, one needs only to alleviate the clinical symptoms and should avoid treating images. Despite a residual stenosis stenting is quite often NOT necessary. We had some success with drug-coated balloons for recurrent benign central venous stenosis. But this technique should only be applied as last resort before stenting or in clinical studies. In case of central venous stenosis due to thrombosis thrombolysis via a local catheter can be applied. Standard contraindications of thrombolysis do apply. Using rtPA an initial dose of 1 -2 mg/h can be used up to a maximum dose of approximately 25 mg. Even in successful cases the underlying cause of the thrombosis has to be evaluated. Mechanical thrombectomy can be used for treatment of central venous thrombosis. Either simple PTA or the use of dedicated thrombectomy devices is possible. But the tortuous anatomy and thin venous vessel walls might yield higher complication rates for thrombectomy devices. At least from a theoretical point of view the likelihood of pulmonary embolism might be greater for mechanical thrombectomy compared to thrombolysis or primary stenting, although some thrombectomy systems can even remove part of the thrombotic material from the circulation. One should be well experienced with thrombolysis or thrombectomy if applying these techniques for central venous stenosis. In any case, covered stents should be available in order to be able to deal with rupture and bleeding. In conclusion, central venous stenosis should be treated in symptomatic patients only. The preferred methods for malignant compression are stenting, for external compression yielding to effort thrombosis is surgery and for other benign cause is PTA. The patients should be well informed about the high likelihood of recurrent disease and the possibility of retreatment. may be an easy and effective treatment since this manoeuver stops the steal exerted on collaterals. Many patients with an elbow fistula have undergone previous attempts at creation of a more distal fistula. It is not rare to see evidence of a residual arteriovenous fistula in the forearm that is ineffective for dialysis but responsible for detrimental residual steal from the distal circulation. Such residual fistulas can be embolized or surgically ligated. Similarly, a residual stump at the anastomotic site of a former fistula or graft can remain patent and be a \"nest\" for local clots that may then escape into the arterial outflow. Spontaneous opacification of the digital arteries up to the finger pad is only seen in mild ischemic syndromes. If spontaneous opacification of digital arteries is not obtained, runs under compression or transient occlusion of the fistula should be performed. If arteries become clearly opacified under fistula compression, healing after treatment of the cause of the steal is likely. When no arteries are visible necrosis is predictable. In contrast, spontaneous hypervascularisation of a finger tip indicates an inflammatory response and rules out the responsibility of insufficient arterial inflow or steal in the genesis of pain or tissue loss: differential diagnoses such as calciphylaxis, infection, arthropathy, etc. should be considered. Confirmed distal arterial hypoperfusion syndrome is an absolute contraindication to dilatation of any kind of stenosis located on the arterialized vein or graft, except in very rare cases of concomitant venous congestion causing hand edema. The resulting increase in fistula flow would mean increased steal on the arterial supply to the hand, with worsening of symptoms. Similarly, it is difficult to predict steal syndrome after overgenerous dilatation of a stenosis in any kind of arteriovenous access. A poor ulnar artery is probably a good indicator of the risk of subsequent development of distal ischemia. In very rare cases, ischemic symptoms can be explained by chronic abnormal venous reflux to the hand as a result of stenosis or occlusion of the main outflow vein. Surgery Surgery has to be considered when there is no indication for percutaneous dilatation. No single treatment is the panacea, and close clinical monitoring is mandatory in the days and weeks following dilatation or surgery. Surgical techniques aim either to reduce fistula flow or to increase distal perfusion. In cases of high flow fistulas (above 1 L/min), flow reduction techniques include banding and RUDI (Revision Using Distal Inflow). Banding aims at creating a narrow vessel segment within the access, close to or at the anastomosis (9). Interventional nephrologists recently described a new approach for banding calibrated on a dilatation balloon (10) . Unfortunately, banding is frequently either too tight, resulting in access thrombosis, or too loose and ineffective. Convincing publications are lacking. RUDI techniques include ligation of the proximal radial artery, which forces the fistula to be fed by the ulnar and the interosseous arteries via palmar arches and collaterals, and techniques leading to replacement of the brachial artery by the radial inflow artery. A graft can be interposed between the radial artery and the elbow vein, with of course concomitant closure of the previous brachial anastomosis in both cases (11) . In low or normal flow elbow fistulas, DRIL (Distal Revascularistion Interval Ligation) is the most popular technique (12) (13) . A graft is interposed between the proximal brachial artery and the distal brachial artery in order to improve flow to forearm arteries. Concomitantly the distal brachial artery is ligated as close as possible to the fistula in order to prevent steal by retrograde flow to the fistula. In forearm fistulas, single distal radial artery ligation (DRAL) is performed as close as possible to the anastomosis, with no distal bypass (14) . Surgical series of DRIL and DRAL report immediately favourable results.",

            "text": "Despite the value of US examinations, invasive angiography is mandatory to define the treatment strategy. Angiography includes opacification of the whole arterial tree from the ostium of the subclavian artery to the fingers, with runs under compression of the vascular access. Visipaque is by far the best contrast medium because it does not cause any pain, and this helps the patient not to move the hand during angiography. The site of cannulation for angiography depends on the clinical presentation. Retrograde cannulation of the arterialized vein or graft can be considered in elbow fistulas, and a 4F catheter can be pushed through the anastomosis into the proximal brachial artery up to the subclavian level. In forearm fistulas, retrograde catheterization of the elbow artery is the best approach, which allows for reflux of the dye up to the ostium of the subclavian artery. It must be kept in mind that in 15 to 20% of patients the radial artery (less frequently the ulnar artery and rarely the interosseous artery) has a high origin from the axillary or brachial artery, far above the elbow joint, and that the artery cannulated at the elbow level can be either the radial artery or the common trunk to the ulnar and interosseous arteries. When no pulse is felt at the elbow level (which is rare) a femoral approach has to be considered. In all cases, it is of paramount importance to be sure that all collaterals originating from the axillary artery are filled with a sufficient volume of iodine when performing the runs centred on the elbow, forearm, hand and fingers, in order to be sure to dye all arteries involved in the distal arterial supply. There are 7 points to be analyzed and recorded when performing angiography for hand ischemia ipsilateral to a dialysis fistula: -search for arterial stenoses, occlusions or emboli, -kinetics of opacification of arteries distal to the anastomosis, -quality and kinetics of opacification of collaterals, -search for additional arteriovenous communications (previous fistulas) or stumps of former fistulas, -quality of palmar arches, -opacification of digital arteries, with runs under compression of the fistula -venous outflow of the fistula Place of interventional radiology Any significant arterial stenosis located upstream from the anastomosis should be searched for and treated (usually by dilatation) since this can improve or cure the patient in many cases. However, some patients are not improved, probably because the increase in arterial inflow mainly benefits the fistula and not the hand. The (rare) major potential complication is embolisation of debris into the outflow and noteworthy the vertebral artery when the stenosis is located in the pre-vertebral segment of the subclavian artery. At the forearm level, dilatation of a stenosis on the proximal radial artery feeding the fistula will have no or little effect on distal ischemia since the resulting increased flow will run into the fistula and not into the distal radial artery. In contrast, dilatation of a stenosis on the ulnar artery whenever technically feasible automatically increases flow to the hand and can cure some patients (8) . Unfortunately, only short stenoses are safely amenable to dilatation, whereas the ulnar artery often shows extensive disease or occlusion. Similarly, short chronic occlusions can sometimes be recanalized and fresh clots (iatrogenic embolism complicating a recent declotting procedure of an elbow fistula) can be aspirated or thrombolyzed. The kinetics of opacification of the artery distal to the anastomosis is of special importance. If the flow is reversed, ligation or embolisation of the distal artery Although the complications of portal hypertension in children are similar to those in adults, the underlying disease processes differ substantially. The main causes of portal hypertension in children are biliary atresia (40-45%), congenital hepatic fibrosis, a1-antitrypsin deficiency, mucovisidosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease and portal vein thrombosis. Current indications for TIPSS placement in children include control of acute and recurrent variceal bleeding (gastroesophageal, intestine, jejuno-jejunostomy or stoma) due to sinusoidal or post-sinusoidal portal hypertension, medically refractory ascites and hepatic hydrothorax. Although children requiring long-term treatment of complicated portal hypertension are more commonly considered for surgical portosystemic shunts because of an improved patency, possible long-term indications for TIPSS include congenital hepatic fibrosis due to polycystic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis and other conditions in which liver function may stabilize or improve with treatment, such as infectious or autoimmune hepatitis or cholangitis. TIPSS after liver transplantation is feasible but could be very challenging especially after split liver transplantation because of the risk of extrahepatic portal vein puncture. In this clinical setting, patency of the hepatic artery should be verified before TIPSS to avoid major ischemic complications. Special technical considerations: 1. Technical differences between pediatric patients and adults to perform TIPSS include, for the pediatric group the need for general anesthesia and for shorter size of metallic stent and technical modifications to access the portal vein. For the choice of the type of stent, anticipation of future liver growth and interference with liver transplantation should be kept in mind. 2. Smaller sheaths (<9 fr) and puncture systems (>16G) than those used for adults paradoxically increase the difficulty of the procedure in children because cirrhotic livers in children are rock-hard, especially in case of biliary atresia due to extensive fibrosis at the portal triad and the small size of the portal vein. Therefore, despite very small portal and hepatic veins in children, adults standard needles (Colapinto or Roesch-Uchida) are commonly used for TIPSS creation. Often a mismatch between needle size and vessel diameter necessitates ultrasound monitoring and subtle guidewire maneuvers to enter the portal vein. Another condition impending sometimes the portal vein puncture is the peripheral course of the major hepatic veins displaced by hyperplastic parenchymal nodules. 3. Various manoeuvers for visualizing the portal system could be useful in case of failed blind punctures of small or tortuous intrahepatic portal branches: series reported to date have to be confirmed.",

Diagnosis, imaging and treatment are often difficult and require a multidisciplinary approach. Digital pressure measurements are essential to assess the diagnosis in non typical cases. The radiologist has the easiest role, providing full arterial mapping of the limb and dilating significant stenoses. Many nephrologists and dialysis nurses underestimate the problem, and this can make it difficult to achieve appropriate follow-up of patients. Finally, the worst and most dramatic cases are the consequence of elbow fistulas. This is a serious reason to encourage the creation of fistulas in the forearm, even in cases of suboptimal arteries or veins at pre-operative mapping. Complication rates in children are similar to those of adults except for an increase in the need for endovascular reintervention to maintain mid-and long-term patency. This fact results from small vessel size, from lower shunt diameter (6 to 9 in children versus 9 to 12 in adults) and the preferential use of bare stent instead of covered stent.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, TIPSS placement for the treatment of complication of portal hypertension in children has been reported in 81 patients (7 series including 3 to 12 patients and 31 case reports). Refractory or recurrent variceal bleeding is the primary indication for portal decompression in more than 90%. The reported technical success rate is 92, including the need for a second attempt in 11 patients. The clinical success rate ranges between 86 and 93% in terms of controlling variceal bleeding. Refractory ascites was improved in 75% of patients. Thrombocytopenia due to severe hypersplenism is consistently improved in only one-third of patients. This indication is still controversial. Early stenosis or occlusion need reintervention during the first month in 25%. 88% of children need reintervention during the first year follow-up. TIPSS serves as a bridge to elective liver transplantation in 49 patients (61%). No case of failed transplantation after TIPSS has yet been reported. Improvement of general condition after TIPSS in 8 children with preserved liver function has postponed or even obviated the need for transplantation. The definitive management for children with cirrhosis is liver transplantation. TIPSS placement provides a useful treatment bridge prior to transplantation, allowing for improving nutrition thereby making the patient a more suitable candidate for liver transplantation. However, the procedure is more difficult than in adults, especially in children with biliary atresia and/or advanced peri-portal fibrosis and the frequency of reinterventions is higher compared with adults. The use of covered stent, sometimes in combination with bare stents, seems feasible in children. 4 . Alternative approaches in case of failed conventional jugular approach have been reported and include a. direct percutaneous transhepatic porto-hepatic connection under sonographic and/or fluoroscopic guidance, the so-called \"Gun-sight technique\" using two loop snares placed within an hepatic vein and a portal vein, b. direct connection between the suprahepatic IVC and the portal vein in BCS patient with hepatic vein and inferior vena cava thrombosis, c. combined direct percutaneous transhepatic and trans-femoral approaches. 5. Unlike adults for whom covered Viatorr stents (WL Gore) are usually and widely preferable, the strategy for stent selection in children depends on a variety of anatomic and clinical factors including the measured size of the main portal vein and hepatic vein on US, age less than 3 years and weight less than 30 kg. Because they are available in a wide range of size and length and could be initially under dilated and later completely dilate or even over dilated according to the liver growth, bare stents has been more commonly placed in children rather than covered stents. Both self-expanding (Wallstent, Boston Scientific) and balloon-expandable stents (Palmaz, Cordis, Johnson&Johnson) have been used, alone or in combination in order to combine flexibility and conformability of the first and the radial force of the second, especially in case of extensive portal fibrosis associated with biliary atresia. The combination of a covered stent placed within the parenchymal tract to avoid acute thrombosis and delayed stenosis with bare stents extending proximally and distally has been applied successfully in children. Appropriate stent positioning in relation to the portal and hepatic veins is important in potential liver transplant candidate. A malpositioned stent could increase the difficulty of transplantation by hampering vascular control or completion of the anastomosis to the hepatic or portal vein. There are few data on the clinical use of e-PTFE covered stent for the management of portal hypertension in children. Covered stentgraft has been used to treat TIPSS-biliary fistula and to revise previously malfunctioning shunt created with a bare stent in 2 patients. Recently, Mermuys reported a good medium-term patency of e-PTFE-covered stent TIPSS in 4 children. The advantageous use of conventional covered Viatorr stent in children by reducing the high rate of restenosis, reported up to 89% at 7 months, with bare stent is counterbalanced by the required minimal diameter of the portal vein and the nitinol skeleton which cannot be over dilated during the growth of the liver. The improved medium-and long-term patency of e-PTFE covered stent could avoid the need for repeated shunt revision under general anesthesia and, in the case of stable liver function, liver transplantation could be postponed or even cancelled, especially in case of acute or subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome. Placement of a second parallel TIPSS in order to accommodate the increased portal venous flow with growth may be an alternative technique. 6. Children submitted to TIPSS should have close follow-up including Doppler ultrasound at 1 day, 1 week, 3 months and then at every 6-month interval, so that eventual stenosis or occlusion can be diagnosed early. Oral anticoagulation is recommended for at least 3 months, and ideally maintained forever or until liver transplantation in case of small TIPSS with diameter less than 8 mm.",

            "text": "Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe the angioarchitectural and radiographic classification of thoracoabdominal collateral vessels, grade IV (visible thoracoabdominal varices from two or more cephalic collateral vessels) is the most frequent in patients suffering from acute, severe variceal bleeding (7) . Refinement in clinical management strategies for patients with cirrhosis and its complications appear to continue to contribute to improved patient outcomes, and retrospective studies have shown a decrease in in-hospital mortality associated with variceal haemorrhage over the past two decades (8, 9) . In patients with variceal haemorrhage, the two accepted indications for TIPS have been (a) acute variceal bleeding that cannot be successfully controlled with pharmacologic agents or with mechanical compression or endoscopic techniques and (b) recurrent variceal bleeding in patients whose conditions are refractory or intolerant to conventional medical management, including sclerotherapy and pharmacologic therapy (10) . Reports of the use of TIPS in these situations have shown rebleeding rates of 23%-40% after 2 years and suggest a substantial improvement in survival. Results of both randomized and nonrandomized studies have strengthened the evidence that TIPS is more effective than endoscopic therapy in the prevention of variceal bleeding (11) . The main problem with TIPS compared to endoscopic therapy is an increased risk of encephalopathy of about 29% (7%-55%), compared to 19% (4%-44%) after endoscopic therapy. Our data suggest that TIPS and adjunctive embolotherapy of gastroesophageal collateral vessels significantly lower the rebleeding rate in comparison to TIPS alone, and an extensive adjunctive embolotherapy of varices may allow us to use a smaller shunt diameter with a consecutively lower rate of encephalopathy (7). The cumulative long-term rebleeding rate in our patients after 4 years was 32%. The long-term rebleeding rate in patients undergoing TIPS in combination with adjunctive embolotherapy of gastroesophageal collateral vessels was only 19% in comparison with 47% in patients undergoing TIPS creation alone, and this difference was statistically significant (7). The rate of encephalopathy de novo was 12%. Our data analysis showed an independent overall effect of variceal embolotherapy on rebleeding (P<.001), and there was an inverse correlation between the risk of mortality due to rebleeding and variceal embolotherapy.",

The use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stents is now preferred. The lower risk of shunt dysfunction and perhaps improved outcomes using covered as opposed to bare stents are the basis for this recommendation. Despite all these improvements, however, the mortality at 30 days among patients in Child-Pugh class C is still 32%, and 75% of the patients who require TIPS as rescue therapy to control index bleeding are in Child-Pugh class C (13) . Recently, reported the results of a randomized, multicenter study that compared early TIPS with optimal medical therapy (endoscopic therapy plus vasoactive drugs) in patients at high risk for rebleeding who were either in Child-Pugh class B with active bleeding at endoscopy or in Child-Pugh class C. After the acute bleeding, the medical-therapy group received endoscopic therapy until obliteration of the varices, followed by surveillance, beta-blockade (in 80% of patients), and nitrates (in 39% of patients). Thirty-one of the 32 patients randomly assigned to the early-TIPS group underwent shunting within 72 hours after endoscopy, and the portal-pressure gradient was reduced to less than 12 mm Hg in all but 2 of these 31 patients. This study shows the benefit of early TIPS in patients with Child-Pugh class B or C diseases which are at high risk for uncontrolled bleeding with standard therapy. Patients who were randomly assigned to receive TIPS had a significantly better chance of remaining free of bleeding than did those who received the standard care (97% vs. 50%), possibly owing to a greater reduction in portal pressure with TIPS than could be achieved with pharmacologic therapy. The rate of survival at 6 weeks was 97% in the ",

To give an update on recent trials on early TIPS efficacy for variceal bleeding 3. To critically discuss the results of early TIPS in comparison with medical and endoscopic treatment At the time of the diagnosis of chronic liver disease (CLD) and cirrhosis, gastroesophageal varices are present in 50-60% of patients; 10 years later, 90% of these patients have developed gastroesophageal varices, whereas in only 1% the varices have disappeared (1) (2) (3) . The risk of bleeding from gastroesophageal varices is 25-35% for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic CLD with the majority of initial bleeding episodes occurring within the first year from the time of diagnosis. For those patients who survive the initial episodes of bleeding, the risk of recurrent bleeding approaches 70%, and the mortality for each episode of bleeding is 15-50% (4). On the basis of the Child-Pugh Classification, the risk of variceal hemorrhage and the mortality rate is increased in patients with advanced stages of CLD and in patients showing large varices (5) . A Child-Pugh score above 9 has been identified as an independent risk factor for death, with a hazard ratio of 1.45 for each 1-point increase in the score (6) Learning Objectives: 1. To review the etiology of refractory ascites in cirrhotics and the medical treatments 2. To present an update of recent trials and meta-analyses 3. To discuss the prognostic factors or subgroups of patients where TIPS should be first option for refractory ascites Ascites due to portal hypertension affects survival and quality of life. Apart from discomfort ascites formation signals poor prognosis and bears the risk of kidney function deterioration and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (1). Abdominal fluid retention occurs in patients with cirrhosis because of the development of portal hypertension in concert with splanchnic vasodilatation, renal sodium retention and active renal vasoconstriction. As the liver cirrhosis progresses, the ascites becomes more resistant to diuretic therapy and refractory ascites develops (2) . According to the criteria of the International Ascites Club refractory ascites is defined as an abdominal fluid collection that cannot be mobilized or the early recurrence of which cannot be satisfactorily prevented by medical therapy. The term refractory ascites has two different meanings: diuretic-resistant ascites and diuretic intractable ascites. Diuretic-resistant ascites does not respond to an intensified diuretic treatment of up to 400 mg/day spironolactone, up to 160 mg/day of furosemide and sodium restriction to a maximum daily intake of 5,2 g of salt/day (3, 4) . Portal hypertension elevates the hydrostatic pressure within the hepatic sinusoids and increases transudation of the ascites fluid, rich in plasma proteins, into the peritoneal cavity. Accumulation of ascites represents, in principal, a shift of the balance between production and resorption of free peritoneal fluid to the side of production (4) . Once refractory ascites occurs, the patient has a poor prognosis with 50% probability of death within 12 months. Liver transplantation should be considered in these patients without delay (2) . Hepatic hydrothorax occurs in patients with ascites when there is direct communication between the peritoneal and pleural cavities. In most patients the defect is in the diaphragm that overlies the dome of the liver. Hepatic hydrothorax is due to an accumulation of ascitic fluid migrating through the diaphragmatic defect (5) (6) (7) (8) . Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a monomicrobial infection of ascites. The diagnosis is confirmed when ascitic neutrophil count is more than 250 cells/mm 3 in the absence of an intraabdominal and surgically treatable source of sepsis. SBP is frequently asymptomatic, its in-hospital mortality has been reduced to approximately 20% with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment (2). Among therapeutic approaches to cirrhotic ascites have been taken repeated large volume paracenteses (LVP), peritoneovenous shunts and TIPS. Peritoneovenous shunts have been abandoned because of a lack of efficacy in comparison to others methods and high rate of complications (2, 3, 9) . Serial therapeutic paracenteses are effective in controlling ascites in patients who truly fail diuretic treatment. However, this treatment may result in protein depletion, aggravates malnutrition, and predisposes to ascites infection. Some patients may have benefit from intravenous albumin infusion after large volume (i.e. 5-10 l) paracenteses (2) . Since the TIPS is quite effective in decompression of portal hypertension, its use in treatment of refractory ascites is widely accepted as the most common indication for TIPS nowadays. Multiple TIPS group as compared with 67% in the medical therapy group, as a result of reductions in rebleeding, sepsis, and liver failure. Hepatic encephalopathy was observed in 12/31 (38.7%) patients in the medical therapy group versus 8/32 (25%) patients in the TIPS group (no significant difference). Summary: Refinement in clinical management strategies for patients with cirrhosis and its complications appear to continue to contribute to improved patient outcomes. TIPS should be done by a multidisciplinary dedicated team and instead of taking a wait-andsee approach, the team should consider the early use of TIPS with an e-PFTE-covered stent as first-line therapy rather than as rescue treatment if rebleeding occurs in high-risk patients with Child-Pugh B or C disease. Further, our data suggest that the long-term rebleeding rate in patients undergoing TIPS in combination with adjunctive embolotherapy of gastroesophageal collateral vessels is significantly lower than in patients undergoing TIPS creation alone. meta-analyses (10) have been published including trials comparing TIPS and LVP. They reported much better control of refractory ascites with TIPS (up to 62 %) than with LVP (up to 24 %). However, the survival and transplant free survival were similar. Encephalopathy occurred more in TIPS group than in LVP group of patients (39 % versus 23 %) (1, (11) (12) (13) . TIPS resulted in a secondary decrease in the activation of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system, and increases sodium excretion. TIPS also improves body cell and muscle mass contributes to the weight gain in malnourished patients with cirrhosis and hypermetabolism (14) .",

            "text": "A thorough selection of patients with refractory ascites and hepatic hydrothorax is the key for successful treatment with TIPS. Scoring of patient using Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been validated to predict early mortality after TIPS (21) . Patients with MELD more than 15-18 or bilirubin level >4.0 mg/dl should be informed of their poor prognosis and TIPS performed only in the absence of other possibilities. An ejection fraction of greater than 50% should be required in these patients. TIPS may convert diureticresistant ascites into diuretic-sensitive ascites. Therefore, continual diuretic therapy after TIPS and titrating this therapy to reach natriuresis is recommended (2) . Technical and medicamentous advances have been introduced in TIPS practice to improve shunt patency and increase effectiveness of treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Consequently, new studies are required to re-assess the role of TIPS in the treatment of refractory ascites (22) . As soon as TIPS creation would be proved to have positive effect on survival, and risk of encephalopathy would be acceptable or medically controlled, then TIPS may become primary therapy for severe ascites. MR-guided focused ultrasound has been utilised in the treatment fibroids for the past decade. It is a slowly evolving technique with improving technology throughout all this period but the potential it holds out is for the completely non-invasive destruction of deep tissue areas such as fibroids with almost no complications and almost no post-procedural complications and morbidity. The fibroids most suitable for focused ultrasound treatment are uterine masses below 15 cm in diameter with fewer than five fibroids in total. Uterine sizes above this usually contain too much volume of fibroid material for effective timely MR-guided focused ultrasound procedures to be carried out, although it is possible to carry out the procedures on larger fibroids over two or possibly three treatment sessions. Similarly, multiple fibroids are problematic due to the amount of sonication sites that need to be chosen. To carry out focused ultrasound safely, a suitable acoustic window must be available to reach the targeted fibroids and this predominantly means an anterior acoustic window free of bowel obscuration must be achieved. Bowel potentially reflects focused ultrasound due to its gas content and may cause unpredictable areas of heat buildup which could potentially cause a bowel perforation. Obsessional attention to eliminating bowel from the beam pathway must therefore be carried out. Similarly, currently it is believed that fibroids which are very hyperintense on T2 weighted MR images respond much less well to focused ultrasound than the more classical fibroids which show low signal T2. Therefore conventionally these fibroids are considered less suitable for focused ultrasound. Recent technology upgrades, however, have allowed much more intense power concentrations to be developed within individual sonications which may allow much more effective treatment of medium-sized hyperintense fibroids than was previously available. No effective evidence as yet is available for this but early anecdotal work suggests that new technologies allow significant improvement in the treatment of hyperintense fibroids. A significant amount of successful pregnancies have been achieved in patients post of MR-guided focused ultrasound with no excess of complications in those pregnancies. Earlier pathological studies also showed that there was no collateral damage adjacent to the uterus in patients who underwent MR-guided focused ultrasound. These findings suggest that focused ultrasound may be a much more effective way of preserving patient's fertility following treatment for their fibroids in comparison to both of myomectomy and uterine artery embolisation. Complication rates following MR-guided focused ultrasound are",

To review the outcomes of liver transplantation in patients with and without TIPS before surgery 3. To review the indications and results of TIPS in transplant patients Indications to perform liver transplantation (LT) are not within the scope of this abstract. The aim is to discuss the clinical benefit of TIPS in patients who are already in the waiting list for LT or in whom the indication to perform LT is being established. Indications to perform TIPS in patients waiting for LT may be similar to those of the \"general population\". They include the palliation/ treatment of symptomatic complications in patients, mainly cirrhotic, suffering from portal hypertension. Patients with advanced deterioration of the liver function (Child B or C) who are waiting for LT and present with non-controlled bleeding from gastro-esophageal varices or refractory ascites will clearly benefit from the creation of a TIPS. A few years ago, patients with acute/subacute Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS) were believed to benefit from TIPS as an effective therapeutic tool while on the waiting list for transplantation. However, several large studies have demonstrated that TIPS should no longer be considered as a bridge to LT but as a definitive treatment option in BCS. Garc\u00eda-Pagan et al have shown that TIPS improves survival and that it should be considered the treatment of choice for BCS. Nevertheless, there is a small subgroup of patients with deteriorated liver function who should be promptly identified, because they will need LT after TIPS. The presence of portal thrombosis has been a relative contraindication to LT. If complete it makes the surgical procedure difficult and, when associated with hepatofugal portal flow, increases the rate of post-operative portal complications (thrombosis). Several published series have demonstrated that TIPS can be safely performed in patients with acute and chronic portal thrombosis. If associated with the embolization of portosystemic collaterals, there is a marked improvement of the hepatopetal portal flow. Therefore, it could be said that TIPS is a very effective tool in patients with liver insufficiency and portal thrombosis who are waiting for LT. There is little information regarding the performance of TIPS in liver transplant recipients with failing grafts as a bridge to retransplantation. Series published by Choi ",

            "text": "Large uterine fibroids are difficult to treat with MRgFUS primarily because of the time required to perform the procedure and/or the requirements for multiple treatments. One approach that has been proposed to try and solve this problem is to pre-treat the patients with large fibroids with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. GnRH agonists (Lupron is commonly used in the United States) are used by gynecologists for treating fibroids prior to hysterectomy or myomectomy. GnRH agonists appear to affect the uterus and myoma volume by the result of decreased levels of estrogen and progesterone, but other mechanisms may be involved, including induction of myoma degeneration and hyaline necrosis, a decrease in the size or number of leiomyoma cells, a reduction in extracellular matrix, or a decrease in blood flow to the uterus. The GnRH agonists reduce the fibroid size, which decreases the time required to treat the fibroid and may allow more patients to be eligible for the procedure. Approximately 20% of patients that are clinically eligible have fibroid volumes that are too large for the procedure (or at least to be enrolled in the study that was being performed). Potentially, the desire for fertility would be a reason for performing MRgFUS. If MRgFUS is able to decrease the size of the fibroid and allow for a more normal endometrial cavity, it is possible that fertility may be improved. Since many patients with large fibroids or multiple fibroids are going to require an abdominal myomectomy, it is possible that this non-invasive approach should be the first option. Certainly concern for premature ovarian failure, at least a theoretical concern for uterine artery embolization, would not be a concern with MRgFUS. Adenomyosis, or at least a focal adenomyoma may also be an appropriate use for MRgFUS. There has been some work that indicates that adenomyosis may respond to MRgFUS and more research is needed in this area. There have been continued improvements to the equipment and the techniques in MRgFUS and continued changes will of course change the ability to treat fibroids, by increasing the speed, and the fibroids that are possible to access. It seems clear that not all patients with fibroids are candidates for MRgFUS, but that should not be a reason not to use MRgFUS in patients who are good candidates. What is important is to properly select patients so that a patient who is likely to benefit is treated and one who is unlikely to respond is treated in another manner. It is important that there be some trials between various treatments for uterine fibroids. One of the most critical is a randomized comparison with UAE since the UAE technique is the least invasive of the alternative techniques. Such a trial may help to better define the criteria for using one technique or another, and better define the appropriate criteria for MRgFUS treatment. Disclosure I am on research protocol with Insightec extremely low and almost no post-procedure adverse symptomatology is experienced due to the nature of the underlying ablation which utilises coagulative necrosis rather than ischaemic necrosis as is seen in uterine artery embolisation. The relative low morbidity of the procedure allows patient is to be treated entirely on an outpatient basis with a swift return to work and other normal activities in less than 24 hours associated with a rapid improvement in symptomatology within the first menstrual period. The cost effectiveness of this type of procedure therefore is remarkably high despite the apparent high initial cost of the capital outlay for the equipment.

            "text": "Uterine fibroids (leiomyoma, leiomyomata, myoma, and fibromyoma) are the most common pelvic tumor in women. The treatment for fibroids includes medical therapy (oral contraceptives, GnRH agonists), myomectomy (hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and open), hysterectomy (laparoscopic and open), and uterine artery embolization (UAE). Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) combines MR imaging to define the target and to control and monitor the ablation, and an ultrasound transducer that controls and delivers the focused ultrasound beam, this allows a noninvasive approach for the treatment of uterine fibroids. Although MRgFUS may be appropriate for some of patients with uterine fibroids, there are some limitations. Patients with multiple fibroids probably more than 3 are not good candidates for MRgFUS. Although it may be possible to determine a fibroid that is most likely to be causing the patient's symptoms, it leaves the patient with multiple fibroids that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. There seem to be fibroids that are more responsive to MRgFUS, at least with some of the equipment that is widely available at this time. Fibroids that are homogeneous and hypointense (dark) on T2 seem to respond better than fibroids that are heterogeneous and hyperintense (bright) on T2. The fibroids should be enhancing. Patients cannot have contraindications to MR imaging such as cardiac pacemakers, sensitivity to MR contrast agents, severe claustrophobia, or those who exceed the size limitation of the MRI scanner. Abdominal scarring or bowel loops in the path of the ultrasound beam are contraindications to MRgFUS. In some patients it is possible to displace the bowel, but it may not be possible. Obese patients may have so much subcutaneous tissue that the fibroid is largely out of the range of the ultrasound beam. The uterus maybe severely retroflexed and the fibroid is located posteriorly again placing it out of range of the ultrasound beam. The ultrasound focus depth is limited to 12 cm for standard protocol. The fibroid may not be able to be treated completely because of its proximity to bowel, bone, spine, nerves, or other structures. Some of the new equipment maybe able to make adjustments to allow treating around these structures. However, it is likely that there will still be incomplete treatment of some fibroids. It is not clear what the long-term results are for fibroids that are incompletely treated with MRgFUS. Continued perfusion may over time lead to recurrent fibroid symptoms. Clearly there is a correlation between the volume of thermal ablation and the clinical outcome. It is clear that the nonperfused tissue volume (NPV) should be as high as possible as there is a close relationship between the NPV and outcomes. If the NPV is greater than 40% the percentage of patients having an alternative therapy 457 C RSE CIRSE Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course respectively. We only included patients with strictures distant from the hilum (Bismuth type I). In both studies ePTFE/FEP covered stents have shown to offer a statistically significant longer patency. There were higher survival rates for the covered stent group with statistically significance for the cholangiocarcinoma group. The difference from the other studies apart from the different stent was the tumour-oriented study and the fact that the patients that were included were expected to have a median survival time of more than three months in order to avoid any influence of the results from patients' early mortality. The relative lower six-month patency rate of the bare stent group was mainly attributed to dysfunction due to tumour ingrowth which is still the main problem of bare metal stents particularly in the cases where the patients survive more than three months. According to Boguth et al [25] , epithelization of a bare metallic endoprosthesis does not occur until the first three to six months, then granulation tissue is formed, giant cells are recruited and tumor ingrowth through the stent`s open cells occurs. This happens more likely in case of invasive malignancies like cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic adenocarcinoma, whereas it is quite unlikely when the stricture is due to enlarged lymph nodes. No significant difference was noted regarding overall cost in the two groups even though the cost of a single session is higher for the covered endoprostheses. This is probably due to the fact that re-intervention rate was higher for the bare stent group. Therefore covered stents are superior to uncovered stents when: \u00b7 Covered stents are used in patients that may survive more than three months. \u00b7 Covered stents are used for tumours that may cause ingrowth. \u00b7 Covered stents with membrane that prevents from tumour ingrowth are used. \u00b7 Covered stents are deployed to strictures distant to the hilum. For all the remaining subcategories of biliary strictures there is not enough evidence of covered stent superiority over uncovered ones. Malignant biliary strictures occur when a tumor or tumor infiltrated lymph nodes narrow the caliber of the bile ducts obstructing the bile outflow towards the duodenum with subsequent biliary stasis. If the bile is not drained a chain reaction of biochemical changes occurs that leads to infectious condition, multiorgan failure and death [1] . The tumors that may cause malignant biliary stenosis are mainly pancreatic adenocarcinoma and cholangicarcinoma. Both are tumors that are detected late and therefore inoperable in most of the cases, with rather poor prognosis. In such cases adequate palliation is paramount for the quality of life of the oncologic patient. The aim of palliation is to avoid another episode of jaundice patient's life permitting the continuation of chemotherapy and avoiding the stress and the complications of a new intervention. Palliation may be offered either surgically or with metallic selfexpandable stents. The initially used plastic stents have been quickly replaced from metallic ones as the latter have shown to offer a more valid and cost effective option for the palliation of malignant jaundice [2] . Both surgery and metallic stents seem to offer similar overall survival but the latter are likely to be associated with lower early complications rate, procedure-related mortality, and cost, offering a better quality of life for the patient [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In more recent studies, palliative surgery has shown more promising results than in the past due to the use of modern and less invasive surgical techniques; however, these results are described in single center retrospective studies and depend mainly on local expertise [8, 9] . Surgical treatment is associated with longer hospital stay, higher initial morbidity and mortality, but re-intervention rate appears to be low. Stent treatment offers lower initial mortality and morbidity rates, but leads more frequently to late biliary complications and re-interventions caused by clotting of the stent, tumour in-or/and overgrowth and gastric outlet obstruction [3] [4] [5] [6] . In order to improve stent's performance and to offer a palliative method leading to fewer re-interventions for the oncologic patient, covered metallic stents have been developed [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Initial data on covered stents were controversial but recent studies have shown more promising results [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Covered stents have been compared to uncovered stents in five articles in the literature. In particular, in prospective randomized study of 2004 by Isayama et al [16] , the authors have used a handcrafted, partially covered self-expandable Ultraflex Diamond Stent (Microvasive; Boston Scientific Corporation, Natik, Massachusetts, USA) with polyether-type, 50-60 mm thick polyurethane and have shown higher mean survival and patency rates in the covered stent group but without statistical significance. There was statistical significance only in the obstruction rate that was lower for the covered stent group. In another study by Park et al [23] , commercially available siliconecovered Wallstent (Microvasive Endoscopy, Boston Scientific Corp, Natick, MA) were compared with the historical data of uncovered Wallstents and shown minor superiority of the covered stents without any significant difference in survival and patency rates. In another retrospective study by Yoon et al [24] , the data from covered and uncovered Wallstents were compared offering very similar results but without statistical significance.

However, after a minimum of 6 weeks of failure of conservative therapies, treatment aiming to decompress or to remove the discal herniation is considered. Conventional open surgery produces suboptimal results and is associated with a high risk of epidural fibrosis. In opposition, percutaneous techniques offer a minimally invasive alternative for disc decompression. Their principle is to remove a small amount of the central nucleus to achieve a drop of pressure inside the herniation, considering that the disc is a closed hydraulic space. Thus, percutaneous disc decompression is only indicated for contained disc herniations. In opposition, extruded disc herniations and free discal fragments are not indicated for percutaneous treatment. Other contra-indications include spinal instability, narrow canal and severe disc collapse. Many techniques of percutaneous disc decompression are available. a) Chemical techniques: since chymopapain is no longer available, intradiscal injection of ethanol or ozone has been proposed to achieve disc decompression. However, prior discogram should be performed to check the absence of annular rupture to avoid extradiscal diffusion of the chemical agent. Moreover, the volume of nucleus destruction is not precisely controlled and may cause a severe secondary discal collapse. b) Mechanical techniques: different percutaneous devices aiming to extract a small amount of nucleus are available. c) However, thermal nucleotomy devices seem to offer better clinical results as they combine mechanical decompression and thermal destruction of intradiscal pro-inflammatory proteins. Thermal techniques include laser nucleotomy and radiofrequency coblation (nucleoplasty).",

Moreover, the time-to-progression -particularly due to local tumor recurrence -has been reported to be shorter after ablation than after resection. Although, in a optimal setting, local ablation can lead to complete destruction of tumor nodules, highly variable rates of local tumor recurrence (between 3.6 and 60%) have been reported in the literature, suggesting major variability in the completeness of ablation. Finally, ablation does not allow for pathologic quality control of the intervention. In addition, small additional metastases may be overlooked in the setting of transcutaneous ablation, where the diagnostic gold standard of intraoperative ultrasound is missing. Thus, surgery remains the gold standard of treatment in patients with resectable liver metastases (Wong 2010). However, local ablation is important method that can be very effective in complementing surgery in order to achieve a tumor-free condition. Also, for some metastatic lesions in critical locations (e.g. those that would require resection of large amount of healthy liver parenchyma for a small tumor nodule), local ablation should be considered instead of resection in a curative intent. In the end, interdisciplinary discussion of each individual patient is required taking into consideration all clinical parameters, but also the experience of the individual surgeons and interventional radiologist. pain.

Considering the general oncological (isolated hepatic tumor load; prognostic benefit), and technical (size, number, location of hepatic metatases; expected hepatic functional reserve) framework surgical resection is still considered to be the method of choice -even if this statement never had been verified by RTCs. Nevertheless, in clinical reality only 20 -30% of patients with liver metastases may qualify for resection. In consequence, the majority of patients need other or at least modified therapeutical pathways including adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and more and more image guided local ablative therapies. The latter encompass chemo-(transarterial chemoperfusion/-embolisation), thermo-(radiofrequency-, Laser-, microwave-ablation, high intensified focused ultrasound), and radio-ablative (radio embolisation, interstitial brachytherapy etc.) techniques. Particularly, the thermal-ablative techniques gained wide acceptance over the last years since ample evidence could be presented that this methods can be applied as primary but also complementary therapies in resectable and non-resectable metastatic disease. Furthermore, recent data confirm that in multimodality therapy concepts progression free survival and overall survival in patients with primarily unresectable and with unfavorable prognosis poorer results comparable to surgery can be achieved.

Data generated with the methodology of evidence-based medicine (EBM) give basis to the formulation of clinical practice guidelines. Randomised trials directly comparing CAS with CEA have produced conflicting outcomes. Initially, the SAPPHIRE study showed promising results. It proved that CAS is not inferior to CEA and showed low periprocedural complication rates as well as low rates of restenosis in high-surgical-risk patients. The SAPPHIRE trial has indicated carotid stenting as an effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy, however, these results could not be confirmed by later trials. Higher complication rates after CAS were found in the SPACE trial and in the EVA-3S trial. This even lead to a premature termination of the latter study. Whereas many single-centre case-series and large registries have indicated that CAS can be performed with acceptable periprocedural complications rates, randomised trials directly comparing CAS with CEA have produced conflicting results. Therefore, a widespread use of CAS was not warranted at that time and continuous efforts were needed to optimise the technique. According to EBM rules, level-one evidence of the safety and efficacy of one treatment mode over the other is only provided by a randomised controlled trial, with results reported by registries considered less valid.

This trial, with defined standards for operator experience, led to a conclusion that in addition to an aggressive medial therapy there are two equivalent treatment options for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis: CEA and protected CAS. The results of the CREST trial were discrepant with the EVA-3S, SPACE and ICSS trials which failed to reach the same conclusion due to a higher stroke rate in the CAS group. These differences were mainly due to trial methodology, particularly because of insufficiently rigorous vetting standards used for carotid stent operators. Numerous studies showed that inexperienced operators without a well defined protocol achieve poorer results in CAS. Unproven experience with carotid catheterisation, as a condition for participation in the trial in all the European studies, is perhaps the most important factor responsible for the overall high rates of stroke reported in these studies. Although interpretation of the results of stenting versus surgery trials for carotid stenosis is still controversial, recent guidelines on the \"Management of Patients with Extracranial Carotid and Vertebral Artery Disease\", published this year in JACC, stated that carotid stenting is comparable to carotid endarterectomy. Even though prestigious organisations shaped these guidelines, this conclusion is premature and unjustified in the opinion of many researchers in view of the data accumulated over the past 5 years. The debate concerning whether best medical treatment, endarterectomy or stenting is the most appropriate treatment is even fiercer, and each of these alternatives has advocates. At the time of Osler, the opinions of senior physicians, based on experience, were regarded as the gold standard on which clinical management was based. Even with the dramatic change in understanding and practice with the introduction of evidence-based medicine, controversies exist, because the evidence may be of doubtful quality and its circulation limited. Experts may disagree on the general values of the accumulated evidence and its application in an individual case. To transfer results from research to practice it is necessary to consider values important for the patient and those of the profession. Clinicians are obliged to find the best way to incorporate sometimes deficient knowledge generated by research with other forms of medical knowledge to choose the best option for each patient.",

In the last century Hunt noticed a relationship between carotid artery disease and stroke but the management of this disease was suggested for the first time in 1951 by Fisher who stated the following: \"It is even conceivable that some day vascular surgery will find a way to bypass the occluded portion of the artery during the period of ominous fleeting symptoms.\" In 1954 successful carotid endarterectomy to surgically manage atherosclerotic disease of the carotid artery was performed. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has proven its effectiveness in preventing imminent stroke in several prospective randomised clinical trials comparing CEA to the best medical treatment. Endovascular treatment for carotid artery stenosis was for the first time used by Mathias in 1978. With the development of stents the endovascular treatment has been undergoing a continuous evolution due to changes in stent design and endovascular technique; from the initial use of balloonexpandable to self-expanding stents and then from closed-cell to open-cell stents. The introduction and continuous improvement of devices preventing emboli as well as increasing operator experience have further enhanced the effectiveness of the procedure. Within the last 20 years, the use of carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been gradually expanding. Although CEA has been the gold standard in carotid stenosis therapy, it has been seriously challenged by the newcomer CAS. Therefore, considerable interest has developed in determining whether endovascular treatment is safer and more effective than surgery for the treatment of carotid stenosis. The medical profession plays a central role in critical evaluation of the evidence related to devices and procedures for the management of disease. Properly applied, thorough expert analysis of the available data documenting absolute and relative benefits and risks of the new procedures is of major importance in improving and optimising 461 C RSE Learning Objectives: 1. To become familiar with the anatomy of the superficial venous system 2. To learn what significant reflux is 3. To learn tips and tricks of ultrasound examination Incompetent valves in superficial, deep, and perforator veins result in venous hypertension in the lower extremity. Over 25% of the adult population has a detectable abnormality related to this process, most often varicose veins or telangiectasias. In 3--8% of the population chronic venous insufficiency results in swelling, pain, hyperpigmentation, dermatitis, and ulceration. Venous ulceration occurs in 3.5 per 1000 per year in patients older than 45 years, and is recurrent in 75%. The etiology of the valvular incompetence is multifactorial. The pathophysiology of the skin changes is not completely understood, but it is linked to the high venous pressures. Venous pressures may rise to over 80mmHg at the ankle in patients with severe disease. The volume of refluxed blood is also important in development of symptoms. Although the initial abnormality is located at the venous valve, the end organ that is damaged is the skin with the subcutaneous tissues. A classification has been developed to describe patients with chronic venous diseases (Table 1) . A complex modification (Venous Severity Scoring) has been proposed that includes the degree of disability, severity of symptoms, and location and type of venous abnormality. Telangiectasias and reticular veins are so common that they are considered by many to be normal manifestations of aging. Incompetent small perforator veins result in dilatation of It is inevitable that controversy will remain in everyday clinical discussions as long as there are advances in medicine, for which the public and medical world continuously hope. Despite the introduction of the more measured era of evidence-based medicine, controversy should continue to stimulate us all to a critical use of our knowledge. Endovenous ablation for varicose vein has become an accepted treatment for varicose veins. The concept is to treat venous reflux by occluding the insufficient varicose vein through heating from inside the vein. The obvious advantage over stripping is the minimal invasive approach allowing an outpatient treatment with nearly no recovery time. The technology is widely used in the United States. In Europe, the technology is less popular. The most likely reason for the difference is the lack of insurance coverage in most European countries. There are two main technologies to apply heat to the vein wall: laser ablation or radiofrequency ablation. Both technologies showed excellent occlusion rates of over 90-95%. During the lecture the different RF technologies are described as well as the differences between f RF ablation and laser ablation.",

More commonly RF waves were used to heat a 7cm element at the tip of a catheter. With this Closure Fast system from Covidien the vein is treated by simple heating without a current running through the vein wall. The concept is to sequentially heat the vein wall to 120 degree Celsius for 20 seconds. The temperature of the probe is held at 120 degree Celsius by changing the Wattage to the heating element. After each heating cycle the catheter is pulled back 6.5cm allowing a small treatment overlap to avoid untreated segments.

The Closure Fast uses a clearly defined step by step treatment algorithm which allows a uniform heat application. Compare to the old Closure system the time required to ablate a certain vein length with the Closure Fast is much faster and similar to the time for laser ablation. In order to make a new minimal invasive treatment option most attractive the discomfort during and after the treatment should be as low as possible. Comparative studies between RFITT and laser (Goode et al. Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg 2010; 40 (2):246-253), respectively Closure Fast versus laser (Almeida et al. JVIR 2009; 20:752-759) the subdermal venous network. Telangiectasias are flat, red blemishes that blanch on pressure with slow return of color. When return of color is brisk, or the lesion is pulsatile, an arteriovenous malformation should be suspected. Reticular veins are small, superficial, thinwalled veins that lie close to the surface of the skin. Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous superficial veins that distend when the patient is upright and can cause aching. Rarely, varicose veins can rupture resulting in major hemorrhage. The dilated veins collapse and symptoms improve with elevation of the extremity. Valvular incompetence in the greater saphenous vein contributes to over 75% of varicosities, with isolated perforating vein incompetence accounting for the remainder. The characteristic skin changes of venous insufficiency are thickening, scaling, and brownish discoloration. There is almost always associated edema, and patients report itching and burning sensations. The color changes are largely irreversible. Lower-extremity venous ulcers are the most severe manifestation of venous valvular insufficiency. These lesions must be distinguished from arterial, traumatic and diabetic ulcers in order to initiate appropriate therapy. Venous ulcers are shallow, irregular, associated with characteristic skin changes, and are located in the medial aspect of the supramalleolar region. Incompetence of the deep and perforating veins, with or without saphenous vein reflux, is present in more than 80% of these patients. Isolated saphenous vein reflux is unusual in patients with advanced disease (skin changes and/or ulceration). Imaging of patients with chronic venous insufficiency is aimed at determining the location and extent of reflux. Ultrasound with Doppler and color flow is highly sensitive and specific (both 95%) for valvular incompetence. Identification of incompetent perforating veins is 80% sensitive but very specific. The examination is performed with the patient standing; otherwise, reflux can be missed. Maneuvers to induce flow reversal are important, and include Valsalva, an automated pressure cuff that inflates and deflates rapidly, or manual augmentation. The exam is easiest when the patient is standing on a dedicated platform that allows the examiner to sit or stand comfortably while interrogating the veins from the ankle to the groin. The greater saphenous vein (GSV), short saphenous vein (SSV), popliteal, femoral, and common femoral veins should be evaluated for patency and reflux. The GSV and SSV should also be examined for diameters, evidence of prior thrombophlebitis, and communication with the deep veins. Both the GSV and SSV insertions into the deep veins must be visualized. In women, veins that track into the ipsilateral introitus should raise the possibility of a pelvic contribution to the reflux. Segmental evaluation is important to localize the abnormal vein segments; thus, the entire length of the GSV, and the SSV to at least the lower border of the gastrocnemius muscle should be interrogated. Reversal of flow that lasts less than 0.5 seconds is normal. Flow reversal for 0.5--2 seconds is suggestive of valvular incompetence, while reversal for longer than 2 seconds is diagnostic. Dilated, incompetent perforating veins underlying venous ulcers may also be identified by US. Contrast venography currently has a limited role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with chronic venous disease. Conventional ascending venography may be performed prior to intervention to localize incompetent perforating veins when US has been unsuccessful. A radiopaque ruler should be placed adjacent to the leg to permit precise localization of the venous abnormality. Descending venography can localize reflux and define the extent when US is unsatisfactory. Patients with varicose veins should undergo a careful history, directed physical exam and duplex ultrasound imaging prior to consideration for EVLT. It is critical to determine the underlying source and pathophysiology of the varicose veins to create an anatomic map and proper treatment plan to ensure clinical success. There are no absolute contraindications for EVLT. The relative contraindications include absent pedal pulses limiting compression stocking use, liver abnormalities limiting local anesthesia administration, pregnancy, breast feeding, inability to ambulate, or uncorrectable coagulopathies. After a proper clinical evaluation and creation of a treatment plan, the patient is placed in a supine position for treatment of the great saphenous vein, or in a prone position for treatment of the small saphenous vein. In the majority of cases, the incompetent truncal vein is directly accessed using Seldinger technique and ultrasound guidance. Tributary veins may also be directly accessed, but are prone to venospasm and are more difficult to access and traverse with a guidewire. The target vein is usually punctured at the lowest or in the most distal segment where the vein is incompetent or dilated, for ease of access and to ensure the entire incompetent segment is treated. Venous access is obtained with a 19-gauge or 21-guage needle, using real time ultrasound guidance and single wall puncture technique. It is helpful to keep the procedure room warm and utilize reverse-Trendelenburg table position to maximize target vein distension and minimize collapse to ease venous access. Once venous access is obtained a 5 or 6 french vascular sheath is inserted over a .035 inch guidewire to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction under real time ultrasound guidance. A bare tipped laser fiber is then inserted through the sheath to the distal tip of the sheath. The sheath is retracted and the laser tip is exposed and positioned 1 cm distal to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction. Confirmation of the location of the tip of the fiber can be confirmed by direct visualization of the red aiming beam of the laser.",

            "text": "One of the key steps to the EVLT procedure is correct delivery of perivenous tumescent anesthesia. Tumescent anesthesia is a form of local anesthesia delivery, which utilizes large volumes of dilute anesthetic solutions permitting anesthesia of large areas. Proper application of tumescent anesthesia should eliminate any pain during laser activation. Tumescent anesthesia also acts to maximize safety and efficacy of the EVLT procedure. Proper delivery of tumescent anesthesia in the perivenous space will ensure apposition of the laser fiber to the vein wall and achieve circumferential contact between the vein walls and laser fiber tip. This will allow adequate transfer of laser energy to the target vein walls resulting in vein wall damage and subsequent fibrosis. The perivenous tumescent anesthesia surrounding the vein also acts as a protective barrier to prevent heating of non-target tissues, including skin, nerves, arteries or deep venous structures. After the administration of tumescent anesthesia, the positioning of the tip of the laser fiber at the superficial and deep venous junction is again confirmed and repositioned if necessary. It is absolutely mandatory that the tip of the laser fiber does not enter the deep venous system to prevent deep venous thrombosis. The laser is then activated as per the individual operator's settings and the vascular sheath and laser fiber are withdrawn as a unit. There are many different energy settings and energy deployment which are beyond the scope of this document. After the sheath and laser fiber have been removed a dressing is applied to the venous access site, followed by class II (30-40 mmHg) thigh high or pantyhose graduated compression stockings. The stockings are applied on the procedure table immediately the procedure, and before the patient gets up off the procedure table. The compression stockings should be worn from morning to night for two weeks after the procedure to prevent recanalization of the treated vein. Ancillary ambulatory phlebectomy or sclerotherapy may be performed immediately after the EVLT procedure or in a delayed fashion after several weeks to treat any residual branch varicose veins. Most patients will showed less pain and less bruising after the procedure. The favourable effect lasted for about 2 weeks. No long-term differences were observed. There are however also advantages for the laser ablation: in general, the one-way equipment is less expensive for the laser fiber compared to the RF probe. Also, the light at the end of the laser fiber can help to localize the fiber tip in addition to ultrasound guidance. The profile of the RF system is 6F, respectively, 7F compared to 4F of certain laser systems. The smaller profile may facilitate access and ease of advancing the system through the varicose vein.",

To learn tips and tricks from the expert Lower extremity venous insufficiency is one of the most common vascular conditions encountered in the population at large. The estimates of the prevalence of this condition vary widely, and are generally in the range of 30% to 35% of women and 10% to 15% of men in Western society. Varicose veins are the most common presentation of lower extremity venous insufficiency. The most common cause of lower extremity venous insufficiency is reflux in the great saphenous vein secondary to a incompetent saphenofemoral junction. The treatment of varicose veins may be for either cosmetic or symptomatic reasons. The traditional historical treatment was surgical stripping and ligation with ancillary phlebectomy of tributary varicose veins. There has been significant evolution of the treatment of lower extremity venous insufficiency in the last 15 years, with the innovation of ultrasound-guided endovenous ablation for the treatment of axial vein insufficiency. More recently there has been considerable refinement in the technique of endovenous ablation and treatment of branch varicose veins with adjunctive sclerotherapy or microphlebectomy. Compression hosiery/bandages: all patients having any type of venous treatment are required to wear compression hosiery for 2 weeks after treatment. This has to be class 2 and no expense should be spared sourcing good quality stockings as the most frequent complaint is of the discomfort of the stockings. Compression stockings alone are an unsatisfactory treatment but their use can be helpful in determining if venous ablative treatment is likely to help symptoms if these are atypical of venous disease. Foam sclerotherapy: foam sclerotherapy using either polidocanol or STD mixed by use of a three-way tap between two luer loc syringes is a very effective means of ablating branch varicosities. Some practitioners use foam sclerotherapy as a primary treatment for truncal vein ablation but the author is of the view that laser or RF provides a simpler quicker and more durable result for this application. Veinwave and superficial laser: veinwave is a very effective treatment for small red thread veins especially on the face and to a lesser degree on the legs. The author considers superficial laser treatment for thread veins to be less satisfactory than microsclerotherapy. Microsclerotherapy: The use of injection of 0.2% liquid STD is the treatment of choice for thread veins on the legs. It is injected in small quantities through a 30G needle. Microavulsions: Microavulsions using cheap disposable vein hooks and mosquito forceps are an excellent means of removing branch varicosities. It can be undertaken without significant discomfort using tumescent local anaesthesia. The author usually undertakes this at follow-up visit but it can be done at the time of the EVLA or RF ablation if only one leg is treated. With EVLA of both legs, the dose of local anaesthetic is too great to allow both EVLA and microavulsions at the same visit. Coagulum aspiration: The use of a large bore cannula to aspirate retained coagulum is useful in some patients to minimise discomfort and skin staining after foam sclerotherapy. Pelvic venous embolisation: Embolisation of the ovarian and internal iliac branches which supply leg varices is a useful technique but is rarely required. RF/laser ablation of perforators: Either laser or RF can be used to ablate incompetent perforators which are a frequent source of varices or truncal reflux. It is undertaken under tumescent anaesthesia. We will also look at the important adjunct of how to market a vein treatment service and how to reduce costs of supplies.

Clinical success after EVLT is defined as permanent occlusion of the treated vein segments with successful elimination of related branch varicose veins and improvement in clinical symptomatology. Most patients will develop bruising of the overlying skin at the site of the EVLT treatment. This is of no clinical consequence and usually resolves in 1 to 2 weeks. Some patients will experience mild discomfort over the treated vein beginning hours after the procedure and resolving in 24 to 48 hours. Many patients will also note a delayed tightness and mild to moderate tenderness over the treated vein, particularly over the distal segment. This sensation described as pulling will usually start at the end of the first week after EVLT and resolve in 4 to 6 weeks. This delayed pain is most likely secondary to venous contraction and fibrosis as the treated vein undergoes permanent closure. Most patients are followed up with duplex ultrasound at 2 to 6 weeks after the procedure date to ensure the treated vein is closed. Most patients are also followed up at 6-or 12-week intervals after the procedure date to ensure the treated vein is closed and perform adjunctive procedures to treat residual branch varicose veins such as sclerotherapy or ambulatory phlebectomy.",

Although in a minority the ablation of refluxing truncal veins is sufficient treatment in itself, most patients require or request additional adjunctive treatment to achieve a good and long lasting result. It is vital that any doctor undertaking venous insufficiency treatments becomes familiar with and experienced in the various adjunctive methods available to deal with: This talk will introduce the audience to the myriad of adjunctive 465 C RSE To discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of dynamic and load bearing imaging Back pain is a common problem of chronic disability in working population affecting two thirds of adults during their lifespan. In terms of anatomy, the discovertebral junction consists of the end plate-disc-end-plate joint of the anterior column and the two facet joints of the posterior column, strengthened by ligaments and muscles. The intervertebral disk is composed of an outer ring the annulus fibrosus and an inner ring the nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus is composed of dense fibrous lamellae and fibroblasts which account for T2 hypointensity. The nucleus pulposus consists of collagen and proteoglycans that create the central T2 hyperintensity of the normal disk. There is rich innervation of the peripheral layers of the annulus fibrosus, the vertebral end plates, the facet joints and ligaments, whereas the inner part of the disk lacks vascularity and innervation. Consequently, the disk itself does not incite pain, but may lead to pain by stretching of the outer layer or the ligaments or by nerve compression and inflammation. Hydration of the disc and annular integrity are important for absorption and transmission of loads to the vertebral column; disc degeneration, with preceding age, leads to loss of these capabilities. MR imaging can assess disc degeneration of variable stages by means of disc signal and morphology on T2-weighted images. Loss of the integrity of the annulus fibrosus results in outward expansion disc material, i.e. bulging, protrusion, extrusion and sequestration The term herniation is defined as the displacement of disc material beyond the normal margin of the intervertebral disc space and has been used interchangeably with extrusion and protrusion. Annular fissures may extend radially or concentrically and involve one or more layers of the annulus. Annular fissures may provoke pain by mediating inflammatory response or be completely asymptomatic. A herniated disc may have no contact with nerve roots, thus not inducing pain, or be in contact and cause deviation or compression of the nerve root with neurologic symptoms and pain. Changes of bone marrow adjacent to the endplate of degenerated discs are common. On MR imaging these changes have been classified by Modic into three types: type I (inflammatory), type II (lipid) and type III (sclerotic). Type I changes are associated with stress, instability and pain and may convert to type 2 or normal. Change of type 2 to type 1 may indicate accelerated degeneration or superimposed pathology such as inflammation. Degeneration of the facet joints can be a source of pain either by irritation of pain fibers from the joint capsule or by nerve root compression. Degenerative changes of the disc and facets cause stenosis of the spinal canal, lateral recesses and neural foraminae. Spinal canal stenosis and spinal lateral recesses are optimally assessed on axial images, whereas sagittal images are very helpful for the evaluation of neural foraminae. Alignment abnormalities, including spondylolisthesis and scoliosis are common sequelae of degenerative disc disease. Spondylolisthesis is most common at L4-L5 level and is due to more sagittal orientation of the facet joints at this level. MR imaging, including T1, T2 and short-tau inversion recovery Munich 2011",

With the patient in the prone position, 3-mm thickness images are obtained to determine entry site and angle of approach. The needle is advanced toward the posterior opening of the joint by a paravertebral oblique or vertical approach (depending on the obliquity of the joint rim). Contrast injection is not needed because CT images clearly show if the tip of the needle is intra-articular. CT-guidance is very useful in case of very narrowed joints or in the presence of large osteophytes obscuring joint access. The site and number of joints treated depend on the side and the level of the symptoms; however, it is difficult to precisely localize the pain to one level, so in most of cases we treat in the same session L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1 joints bilaterally. Some physicians inject the steroid-anaesthetic mixture at periarticular level, arguing that the efficacy of this procedure is comparable to intra-articular injections. There is disagreement as to whether intra-articular injection is preferable to periarticular injection. However, there is no reported evidence that the efficacy of these two different approaches is the same. The efficacy of facet joint injections has been validated by many studies showing that this procedure offers pain relief in 40-54% of patients at 6-month follow-up, even if the efficacy of the procedure is lower at longer follow-up clinical evaluations. However, the true efficacy of facet joint injections is uncertain and is still debated. The reasons are the different technical approaches adopted in the published series and the often criticisable patient selection. Some published studies include patients merely complaining of low back pain, without differencing patient with clinical findings of facet syndrome. Therefore, in our opinion the key for a good success of this procedure is clinical patient selection. A recent study reported that the outcome of the procedure is significantly higher if patients are selected by means of bone scintigraphy with SPECT. A promising and interesting innovation is the intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate in the facet joints, as well established for other synovial joints. This treatment seems to be more effective than steroid injections, especially in the long term. Sometimes imaging shows facet joint synovial cysts at the anterior aspect of the joint; the cysts can be responsible of radicular compression and related symptoms. The same technique described for facet injections can be used for the management of the cyst. Intra-articular-injected contrast agent usually fills the cyst because of a patent communication, therefore the cyst can be aspirated and steroids injected for pain relief. Medial branch nerve block techniques have been proposed as a valid alternative to joint injections for the management of facet syndrome. All these procedures are based on the denervation of the facet joint to achieve pain relief. The medial branch of the dorsal ramus of the spinal nerve root innervates two adjacent facet joints. Branches from one nerve root innervate both the level of the exiting root and the next lower level (i.e. L4-L5 facet joint is innervated by branches from the medial branch of both L4 root and L3 root). Therefore, denervation of a single facet requires block of medial branch at the same and at the upper level. Medial branch block can be obtained by simple perineural injection of steroids and anaesthetics but the results of this procedure are similar or lower than intra-articular injection. Alternatively, rhizotomy can be induced by alcohol injection or radiofrequency denervation. The site of rhizotomy is the notch between the transverse process and the superior articulating process. To achieve chemical denervation, 1.5 ml of 95% ethanol is usually injected for each level. Medial branch block can be performed under fluoroscopic or CT guidance; however, CT should be preferred whenever it is possible because it ensures precise needle positioning. Denervation is usually temporary but it can be permanent after alcohol rhizotomy. Radiofrequency rhizotomy provides some shortterm improvement in pain and functional disability but in the longterm the efficacy of this treatment is still controversial and success rates range from 11 to 78%. Recently, percutaneous kryorhizotomy has been proposed as a new procedure to achieve facet denervation. In this procedure, a 1.3-mm device is positioned under imaging guidance in the site of the medial branch. CO 2 inflation",

To present patient management and review literature Facet joints are a very common but underestimated source of pain. A recent study showed that facet joints are responsible of at least 31% of cases of low back pain. Facet joints are responsible of a welldefined syndrome that can be diagnosed by detailed history and physical examination. However, establishing a diagnosis of facet syndrome is difficult because findings are nonspecific; moreover, the assessment of the role of facet joints in low back pain is difficult because usually pain depends on more concomitant factors. Lumbosacral facet syndrome is characterized by low back pain that may radiate to the buttock and posterior thigh, without a precise dermatomeric distribution. Pain typically does not radiate below the knee. The pain is usually worst in the morning and it is exacerbated by rest, hyperextension and torsion movements. Imaging can show facet joint osteoarthritis and sings of instability; however, a mismatch between clinical and imaging findings is frequent. Several interventional procedures have been developed for the management of facet syndrome; they can be divided into joint injections and medial branch of the dorsal ramus nerve block procedures. Intra-articular facet joint injections have a diagnostic and therapeutic role. Diagnostic injection of local anaesthetic is performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis of facet syndrome. If the joints are the source of pain, the patient experiences rapid pain relief after the injection. For therapeutic injection a long acting steroid is added to the anaesthetic to produce more durable pain relief. The technique of facet injections is easy and this procedure can be safely performed on outpatient basis. The contraindications are referred allergy to the proposed drugs and uncorrected haemorrhagic diathesis. The procedure can be performed under fluoroscopic or CT guidance; the choice mostly depends on individual preferences of the operator and equipment availability and no outcome differences have been observed. However, fluoroscopy is usually faster than CT guidance, especially is multilevel injections are needed. Otherwise, CT-guided injections are easier to perform and avoid operator exposure. When using a C-arm or an angiography system, fluoroscopy-guided injections are performed with the patient in the prone position. The target joint is localized and the tube is angled laterally since the posterior opening of the facet joint as 2 parallel lines. Since facet joint is a curved structure, access can be difficult if the tube is too much angled, because the anterior opening can be imaged and confused with the posterior opening. A 9-cm length 22-G spinal needle is directed toward the posterior opening of the joint or toward the inferior recess and local anaesthetic is injected along the course of the needle. This step can be performed without live fluoroscopy and spot images are needed only to check the needle position. When the needle is close to the joint, live fluoroscopy can be useful to enter the narrow joint; however, the needle can be directed simply by tactile sensations. When the needle enters the joint loss of resistance is often felt. Contrast agent injection is useful to confirm the intra-articular position of the needle. Then, 0.5 ml of local anaesthetic and 0.5 ml of a long acting steroid are injected inside each joint. We usually inject bupivacaine and triamcinolone acetonide. If the procedure is performed only for diagnostic purposes, 1 ml of anaesthetic is injected. This amount of injected substances should not be exceeded because the capacity of a lumbar facet joint is 1.0-1.5 ml: excessive intra-articular injection can result in capsular damages. The procedure can be easily performed under 467 C RSE",

To review the contra-indications for treatment of vascular tumours and malformations Vascular malformations and vascular tumors are grouped under the name of vascular anomalies. Many different nomenclatures have been used in the past attributing to confusion and misunderstanding about the nature of this disease entity. The clinical and biological classification as proposed by Mulliken and Glowacki in 1982 and adopted by the ISSVA (the international society for the study of vascular anomalies) offers a simple way of classifying the different entities and has been widely accepted as the standard. According to Mulliken and Glowacki vascular anomalies are divided into vascular tumors and malformations. 1. Vascular tumors are tumors with rapid disproportional growth and can further be subdivided in haemangioma (infantile haemangioma (classic type, not present at birth) and congenital haemangioma (present at birth and further subdivided into NICH (non-involuting congenital haemangioma) and RICH (rapid involuting congenital haemangioma) and rare congenital tumors like tufted angioma and kaposiform heamangioendothelioma). The infantile haemangiomas for two minutes creates a frozen area at the probe's tip producing rhizotomy. Denervation is temporary and pain reduction is observed in 50% of cases after 6 months and 40% after 12 months. Finally, very recently, focused ultrasound MR-guided interventions had been also proposed. The preliminary results confirm that this new approach could be promising and even easier than those previously reported. is clinically characterized by pain exacerbated upon putting strain on the supporting ligaments and joint space and is typically localized over one or both SI-joints. However, often diagnosis is made by exclusion of a variety of other possible causes of lower back pain. In selected cases, MRI is helpful in detecting early sacroiliitis as it is essential for the exclusion of other possible causes of lower back pain. Nervous structures innervating the SI-joints belong to the lateral branches of the posterior primary rami from L2 to S3; however, large variations of patterns have been described. Rationale: Pathophysiologic basis of SI-joint pain include a variety of entities such as inflammatory arthritis, degenerative processes, fractures or benign and malignant tumors. If all other causes are excluded by clinical and imaging findings, symptomatic treatment (i.e. SI-jointinjections) can be considered. Para-or intra-articular injections do have a diagnostic value (i.e. to confirm or exclude SI-joint-syndrome) and if successful, thereafter a therapeutic role which can be temporary or potentially definitive. Temporary effect is provided by a mixture of local anesthetics with steroids, while definitive treatment can be achieved using thermoablation. Technique: SI-joint-injections can be performed through a dorsal approach guided by fluoroscopy or preferably by low-dose CT. Two different locations have been described: the medial border of the SI-joint or the demitting S1-3 foramina. In cases of inflammatory SI-jointdisease, intra-articular injection is possible.

The whole cycle can take up to ten years. In principle, haemangiomas will regress spontaneously. Treatment is only indicated when complications occur (bleeding, ulcers etc). The congenital haemangiomas are present after birth. The clinical picture resembles infantile haemangiomas; however, the proliferative phase seems to have taken place in utero. 2. Vascular malformations can be further subdivided into high flow and low flow malformations 2a. Low flow malformations -capillairy malformations -venous malformations -lymphatic malformations (micro and macrocystic)mixed malformations 2b. High flow malformations -arterio-venous malformations -arterio-venous fistula. Both high and low flow vascular malformations can be seen in combination with other anomalies in several syndromes (Maffucci, Bluerubber bleb nevus syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome etc.) The clinical picture of high and low flow malformations is quite different. The low flow venous malformation for instance is characterized as a soft easy compressible swelling and if located superficial often a blue discoloration of the skin is noted. On plain X rays sometimes phleboliths are found. If present they might be an indication that a consumption coagulopathy is present and further blood testing of fibrinogen and D-dimers is indicated. The high flow malformations on the other hand exhibit as a pulsating mass, and often on auscultation a bruit is heard. The swelling can be painful. Necrotic areas can develop and if shunting is high cardiac complications can develop. Imaging of vascular malformations should be directed by clinical assessment of the type of malformation to be expected, clinical symptoms and need for treatment. Imaging needs to be tailored to the individual patient although general rules can be applied. Duplex ultrasound together with a clinical assessment is often sufficient to make a proper diagnosis. This is especially true for the pediatric population. If more information about extent of the lesion is needed MR is often used in case of low flow lesions (venous/lymphatic) and MRA or CTA in case of high flow lesions. Angiography is always needed if a AVM is diagnosed and treatment is planned. High frame rate imaging and selective injections are the only option for a proper evaluation of the nidus architecture of the AVM. Exceptions to these general rules however can be necessary. It is further essential to realize that this is a difficult to treat disease entity. Although it is a benign disease patients can often not be treated curatively. Involvement of other disciplines is often needed. A long time commitment should be offered to the patient. This can only be realized if the interventional radiologist is a member of a vascular malformation team. If such a team is not present patients should be referred. ",

            "text": "Department of Imaging, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom. A two-needle technique is advocated, particularly for lesions with slow venous outflow, allowing an escape route through the second needle when contrast or sclerosant is injected through the first needle, and thereby minimising the risk of extravasation. If using foam, the first few needles should be placed deep within the lesion so that the foam does not obscure the whole lesion for subsequent US-guided needle placement during the procedure. Contrast is then instilled via one or both needles under fluoroscopy guidance, to delineate the lesion and allow assessment of outflow. Opacification of large outflow veins, particularly if they are part of the normal deep venous system, should warn the operator not to proceed or to apply a tourniquet above the lesion where possible, to occlude outflow. Note that obstruction of outflow increases the risk of extravasation of sclerosant around the lesion and the serious risk of arterial reflux of sclerosant, which should be avoided at all costs. With or without a tourniquet, fluoroscopy techniques should be optimised so that any trace of arterial reflux is seen early and the sclerosant injection halted, so that the risk of non-target sclerotherapy is minimised. STS should be opacified with contrast. Many operators advocate mixing STS with air (STS:contrast:air = 2:1:1) to create a foam solution. This acts to displace the blood within the lesion, rather than mixing with it, so that sclerosant contact with the entire endothelium is maximised. Sclerosant is instilled until there is some resistance to injection or until the lesion is well filled. This often requires several injections at various sites within the lesion, and on each occasion the same meticulous procedural steps should be followed. The total dose of STS should not exceed 0.5ml/kg, or a total dose of 20-30ml per session, and is often lower. Operators should be wary of the effects of local swelling, which can be considerable with STS, and consider multiple sessions, each with a lower dose of sclerosant, so that swelling is manageable and patient compliance with treatment increased. This is particularly the case with facial lesions, where bruising and swelling are considerable, and lesions affecting joints, where swelling can cause pain and decreased function in the postoperative period. Most operators advocate post-operative compression of the malformation for several days, using either a simple bandage or a compression garment, which should have been fitted for the patient prior to treatment. Urine may be discoloured for up to 24 hours post-treatment and active hydration should be encouraged. Patients should be warned that the lesion will appear much worse for 7-10 days posttreatment; children, in particular, should be prepared for this, as it can be distressing. Regular analgesia may be required, although the visual effects are often worse than the symptoms. The two major complications of sclerotherapy are skin breakdown and nerve damage. Skin breakdown occurs either due to the sclerosant infiltrating skin that is already affected by the malformation and therefore thinned and fragile. In such cases, superficial injections should be avoided if possible. Soft tissue breakdown can also occur secondary to arterial reflux of sclerosant, which is carried to normal tissues adjacent to or distant from the lesion; the results of this are unpredictable and can be severe. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for nerve damage. This complication has been documented with most agents. Possible mechanisms include direct effects of sclerosant on adjacent nerves, irritation of nerves by surrounding inflammation and compartment syndrome. In many cases, nerve injury resolves, but permanent loss of function can occur.",

To review the complications of embolization in low flow AVM and how to minimise them Low flow vascular malformations are the commonest lesions encountered in the vascular malformation field. According to the Mulliken and Glowacki classification first proposed in 1982, the umbrella term of vascular anomalies is divided into two distinct categories: haemangiomas plus other vascular tumours, and vascular malformations [1] . Vascular malformations are further categorised by vessel or channel type: venous, lymphatic, capillary, arterial, or mixed. Venous, lymphatic and capillary malformations are typically considered to be low flow lesions, while arterial malformations are high flow. Capillary malformations, such as port wine stains, are very common but there is very little role, if any, for interventional radiology in their management. Although arterial malformations (true 'AVMs') are frequently discussed in the literature and attract a great deal of attention, venous and lymphatic malformations are seen far more commonly, and are usually more straightforward to treat. The remainder of this abstract will discuss only venous (VM) and lymphatic (LM) lesions. Patients with all but the simplest of low flow lesions should be managed by a multidisciplinary team [2] . This should include interventional radiology (IR), plastic surgery, orthopaedics, dermatology, and haematology where necessary. In particular, LMs have a preponderance for the head and neck region, and complex lesions often require airway management by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist. Ultrasound (US) is useful in patient assessment, particularly in paediatrics where most lesions are superficial. In almost all cases, US allows a distinction to be made between LM and VM. Most lesions also require MRI, which allows accurate delineation of the lesion, and assessment of potential complications such as joint involvement and airway compromise. Patient selection for treatment should be made in conjunction with the multidisciplinary team. Considerations include pain, disability or dysfunction, cosmetic issues and complications such as recurrent infection in LMs. The expectations of the patient and family should be actively managed, as many patients expect a complete cure and this is rarely possible. Most macrocystic LMs will respond well to one or more sclerotherapy procedures but most other lesions require long-term management; treatment should be seen as part of the management of the malformation rather than a cure. Most sclerotherapy procedures are performed under general anaesthesia, as injection of sclerosant is often painful and some procedures can be lengthy. Venous malformations: The treatment of choice for VMs is almost always sclerotherapy [3] [4] [5] [6] . There are a variety of agents available but the commonest is sodium tetradecyl sulphate 3% (STS). Alcohol is an alternative agent but is very aggressive in its effects and is associated with higher complication rates; success rates do not seem to be better than with STS. The lesion is usually approached percutaneously, under US guidance. ",

            "text": "Macrocystic LMs appear on gray scale as anechoic cavities with possible internal septa and debris. Microcystic lesions have small some extent on the agent used and the morphology of the lesion. In general, macrocystic lesions respond better to sclerotherapy than microcystic lesions. Sclerosing agents for LMs include STS, doxycyclin, OK432 and bleomycin. Some agents, such as OK432, act by inducing sterile inflammation within the lesion over several days or weeks, leading to progressive scarring and shrinkage of the cysts [10] . Others, such as STS, act in a similar way to venous sclerotherapy, causing immediate endothelial damage. The former agents simply need to be instilled into the lesion as part of a very quick and simple procedure, while the latter agents often require techniques such as changes of posture during the procedure, extended dwell times and repeated instillation/drainage of sclerosant in order to maximise endothelial contact with the drug. Most lesions are accessible percutaneously. When treating macrocystic malformations, a single needle is placed into the lesion under US guidance; usually a 21G needle will suffice, although some cysts may contain thick debris or haematoma from recent intralesional bleeds or infections, both of which are recognised sequaelae of LMs. The largest cysts should be drained to dryness, though care should be taken not to lose access to the lumen of a completely collapsed cyst. The sclerosing agent is then instilled, almost always in smaller quantities than the volume of fluid initially aspirated. The dose depends on the agent used. Operators vary as to whether they use fluoroscopic screening during injection; in my practice, this is not considered necessary, as instillation of sclerosant can be followed clearly on US and non-target sclerosant should not be an issue, as the lesion is not in communication with the venous or arterial system. In general, sclerotherapy of microcystic lesions does not have as good outcome rates as macrocystic disease. The principle of sclerotherapy is to try to access the largest of the cysts with a small gauge needle and instil the agent slowly so that the drug percolates through the lesion, as most of the cysts communicate. In practice, it often involves bathing the whole area in the drug with inevitable extravasation of sclerosant. Therefore, potent agents such as STS and alcohol should be avoided. Most agents cause some degree of post-treatment bruising and swelling. This can last 1-2 weeks. When treating peripheral lesions, this is not clinically significant but swelling of head and neck lesions can lead to airway compromise and these patients should be actively managed on an appropriate clinical ward. Complications include post-treatment infection, which usually requires just a 5-day course of oral antibiotics, and intralesional haemorrhage, which causes sudden swelling and bruising and can be uncomfortable. Neither complication appears to have a negative effect on the outcome of sclerotherapy. Potent sclerosants such as STS and alcohol are at risk of causing localised skin breakdown. Outcome rates of lymphatic sclerotherapy vary between agents [11] [12] [13] . In general, macrocysts respond better than microcysts. Outcomes appear, in some specific instances, to be site-dependent; orbital LMs appear to respond well to sclerotherapy, while tongue involvement does not usually respond adequately. Adverse effects were mild, such as fever, lethargy and local inflammation manifesting as local pain, redness and swelling and only occurred in 5-8%.",

Adjunctive techniques such as coil or tissue adhesive embolization or laser ablation may be helpful in selected cases such as in children in whom rapid venous outflow is demonstrated or in those individuals with large varices or persistent lateral veins such as in KT syndrome. In addition, anastomoses with the normal deep veins can also be occluded with coils or NBCA prior to the injection of the sclerotherapy agent.

Response rates of between greater than 90% have been described with 3% STS foam sclerotherapy in a small series after a mean of four treatment sessions.

To review the contra-indications for IR treatment in acute and chronic DVT It should be obvious to anyone that deep venous thrombosis has the potential to cause pulmonary emboli and perhaps death. Every airline has a policy to help their passengers prevent deep venous thrombosis. Anticoagulation remains the primary method of treatment of most deep venous thrombosis but a significant number of persons progress on anticoagulation to develop extending venous thrombosis. Many of these have an excellent indication for catheter directed or even systemic thrombolysis provided the duration of thrombosis is less than 10-14 days. Although there is long standing evidence that thrombolytic therapy is associated with more rapid and more complete clearance of lower limb deep vein thrombosis (1,2) the ultilisation of thrombolysis in deep venous thrombosis is lower than optimal. The major reasons for this reluctance to use thrombolysis are that the risk of major bleeding is over-stated by physicians and that the clinical relevance of rapid relief of venous obstruction requires more robust data. Since historically there is a risk of major bleeding with thrombolytic therapy many patients are unwilling to accept a perceived extra risk of death or disability. The one indication that has gained wide acceptance is phlegmasia cerulea dolens (aka venous gangrene). Sadly in the author's experience it invariably presents itself on a basis of failed anticoagulation with heparin. These cases would have been better treated from the outset with catheter-directed thrombolysis. Thrombolysis is indicated in any case of ilio-femoral or vena cava deep venous thrombosis which is less than 10-14 days of onset. The reason for this cut-off is that once fibrin has cross-linked, pharmacological thrombolysis is not effective. However, since not all of the thrombus is necessarily cross-linked at once, in some critical cases of more chronic thrombosis, it may be worthwhile attempting a pharmaco-mechanical thrombolysis with a readiness to angioplasty and stent any residual venous stenosis. There are data that indicate that early and complete lysis with catheter-directed thrombolysis is effective in reducing the post-thrombotic syndrome in patients who have femoral or iliac deep venous thrombosis (3) . A trial that randomly selected patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis to either catheter-directed or systemic thrombolysis showed that venous valvular competence was preserved in more patients with catheter-directed therapy (4) . A more recent study in children aged 11-19 years confirmed the safety of pharmaco-mechanical thrombolysis with a greater than 90% technical success and no major bleeding. In this group the cumulative incidence of postthrombotic syndrome was 13% at 1-2 years (5). A prior study by these authors showed an incidence of postthrombotic syndrome of 80% in children when thrombolysis was not used (6) . The risk of major bleeding is also significantly less with catheterdirected thrombolysis especially if pharmaco-mechanical systems or sequestered thrombolysis is used.

Post-thrombotic syndrome is significantly underrecognised by those physicians who initially see patients presenting with DVT-namely those in the Emergency Room, General Practice, and Internal Medicine. PTS is also the single biggest determinant of quality of life at 2 years post-DVT. Anticoagulation (AC) has been the mainstay of DVT \"therapy\" for over 50 years. Of course, therapy may be slightly too strong a word as AC merely reduces the risk of proximal propagation whilst relying on the body's won fibrinolytic (used in this context interchangeably with thrombolytic) mechanisms to attack the thrombus. Methods of anticoagulation are also changing considerably with a whole host of new treatments coming on stream, but that is outside the scope of this review. More aggressive methods of DVT therapy rely on administering thrombolysis preferably in as high a concentration as possible deep within the thrombus. The trick is to achieve as high an intra-thrombus dose (thereby dissolving as many of the fibrin strands holding the whole show together) while getting as little systemic release as possible (which gives rise to the bleeding etc.). Systemic thrombolysis essentially yields more of the side effects and less of the thrombus dissolution. It should also be stated that the more central the DVT, the greater the effect, and therefore the majority of this review will concentrate on iliofemoral DVT rather than femoro-popliteal venous thrombosis. It is also important to note that there is no randomised control trial showing these aggressive forms of DVT treatment to be beneficial compared to the current gold standard of anticoagulation. (That is in fact the purpose of the ATTRACT trial in the USA which is currently mid way through recruitment. It is designed to assess, statistically, whether catheter-directed thrombolysis/combined CDT plus mechanical methods is superior at 2-year follow-up compared with standard anticoagulation.) Nonetheless there is now a considerable body of evidence demonstrating improved patency rates of venous segments, less reflux and most importantly improved clinical results in terms of reduction of PTS, following catheter-directed thrombolysis as well as a combination of mechanical methods and thrombolysis. There are several small but well worked trials comparing thrombolysis and its' variants plus anticoagulation vs. anticoagulation alone. In addition, there is considerable evidence that pneumatic compression boots and compression hosiery add significantly to results and reduce the incidence of PTS. In 2008 CHEST finally recommended CDT for acute iliofemoral DVT with a 2B rating, with mechanical combined with thrombolysis deemed worthy of a 2C. The purpose of this 30 minutes is to present the attendee with virtually the whole armamentarium in the management of acute of tissue plasminogen activators and urokinase, streptokinase use should be discontinued. Most of the \"horror stories\" of haemorrhage used by clinicians to frighten patients away from thrombolysis are from the streptokinase era. Thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism is indicated when there is a major recent embolus with persistent systolic hypotension (7). Other indications including right ventricular dysfunction or visible large embolus on imaging are less accepted and a decision to use thrombolysis should be made on a case by case basis. Some pharmaco-mechanical devices may not be safe to use in the pulmonary circulation. Currently there are no trials of thrombolytic therapy for infra-popliteal deep venous thrombosis. The preferred treatment is anticoagulation with the expectation that proximal extension of thrombosis will be halted. Unfortunately this is not always the case. (7): 1099-1104. 37.

Although the traditional \"treatments\" do not involve interventional radiologists to any great extent, it is clear that we have more to offer patients than just saving seriously compromised limbs. In fact of all specialties, we are ideally placed to be intimately involved with all aspects of care -from initial presentation, diagnosis using US, CTV or MRV; onto different treatment options and lifelong longitudinal follow up. Who should be looking after patients with DVT; internal medicine physicians who prescribe anticoagulation; or interventional radiologists who can diagnose the problem, remove the thrombus, restore patency of venous segments by placing stents, and then follow-up patients long term?

            "text": "Hematuria is the most commonly reported symptom and varies from microhematuria to macrohematuria, occasionally with resultant anemia that requires blood transfusion. Cystoscopy may identify a left ureteral origin. The presumed mechanism for hematuria is that compression leads to left renal vein hypertension, which may result in rupture of the thin walled vein into the renal calyceal fornix. Pain is the next most common symptom. It is sometimes characterized by abdominal or flank pain that occasionally radiates to the posteromedial thigh and buttock. The pain is typically exacerbated by sitting, standing, or walking. Some patients describe typical symptoms of pelvic congestion. Other manifestations include vulvar or lower extremity varices. Nausea and vomiting have been described due to splenic vein compression. The presumed mechanism for pelvic congestion or symptomatic varicocele is the formation of collateral venous circulation such as a prominent left ovarian vein or testicular vein with their associated symptoms, such as vulvar varices in females or varicocele in males. The diagnosis is typically made on clinical suspicion confirmed by duplex scanning, CT or MRI. Some will only base the diagnosis on demonstration of a hemodynamically significant pressure gradient across the point of compression during catheter venography. Management options range from observation to nephrectomy, depending on the severity of symptoms. Conservative treatment is recommended for mild hematuria. The correlation between imaging evidence of left renal vein compression and clinical symptoms remains challenging, and therefore most authors recommend that interventions should be considered only when symptoms are severe or persistent. Many authors recommend a conservative approach, with observation for at least 2 years because as many as 75% of patients will spontaneously have significant symptom resolution. Most treatments aim to decrease LRV hypertension, but others are directed against pelvic venous reflux. Treatment options include surgical procedures to achieve venous decompression, the most common being transposition of the left renal vein to the IVC, and endovascular procedures including stenting of the left renal vein and embolization of the left gonadal vein. Level I evidence does not exist for any given therapy, or even for existence of the syndrome. In the author's opinion, treatment should be reserved for those patients in whom other causes for their symptom complex have been exhaustively excluded, and where the severity of the symptoms justify the risks of the chosen therapy.

            "text": "Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe is a hyperthermal ablation technique, based on thermal induction by electrical energy. A high frequent alternating current (275-480 kHz) is brought into tissue by an electrical active probe and induces frictional heat due to ionic agitation. The heat extends by thermal conduction and is limited by the cooling effect of blood perfusion of the surrounding tissue. Heat distribution within target tissue is depending on several factors like fluid content, electrical conductivity and blood perfusion and decreases nearly linearly with distance to energy source. The shape of resulting coagulation necrosis is mainly depending on probe configuration, but also of the presence of heat sink effects by cooling vessels (segmental arteries) and collecting system. Modern probes allow ablation of lesions between 2 and 5 cm in diameter. In experimental work, increase of necrosis was achieved by temporary occlusion of the renal artery. A similar effect is obtained by superselective tumor embolization prior to ablation by particles or lipiodol, which is suggested in lesions exceeding 3 cm in size. A further increase in ablation volume requires reposition of the probe. In order to avoid thermal collateral damage in adjacent structures like bowel or liver, an additional injection of carbon dioxide or 5% glucose is suggested in cases of exophytic tumors with broad contact to neighbour organs. In opposition to cryotherapy, thermal effects cannot be imaged directly and requires a thorough monitoring by ultrasound or CT. Under sonographic control, hyperechoic signals due to gas bubbles are seen regularly at the end of coagulation. Unfortunately, they do not correlate to the extent of final necrosis. As coagulated and thus necrotic tissue is not perfused, the use of contrast agent (either US or CT) allows a clear delineation of viable tumor and is recommended to be used before the probe is being removed. Thus, residual tumor can be ablated within the same session. After successful ablation, track ablation avoids bleeding complications and tumor cell seeding successfully (4) . What do clinical results say? The effects of minimally invasive treatment of renal cell cancer with curative intent must be comparable or better than established resective techniques (5) . Although studies with a follow-up period of more than 5 years are still rare, a couple of papers show quite convincingly results. Levinson and co-workers (6) reported on 31 patients with 34 RFA treatments with a mean diameter of 2 cm (1-4 cm) . During a mean follow-up period of 61.6 months (41-80), 3 recurrences 7, 13 and 31 months after intervention were observed, resulting in a overall recurrence-free survival of 90.3% and a 100% metastasis-free and disease-specific survival rate. McDougal and co-workers (7) reported on a 93% recurrence-free survival in 16 patients during a follow-up of 55 months with tumors less than 5 cm in diameter. Stern and co-workers (8) achieved a 98% recurrencefree survival in 63 patients over a mean follow-up of 34 months (1-80 months) in renal tumors of 2.1 cm in mean diameter (1-4 cm) . These promising results were confirmed by Ji and co-workers (9) who reported on a local tumor control rate of 98.1% in 106 patients suffering from RCCs (size range 0. 9-5.5cm in diameter), resulting in a disease-free survival rate of 97.8% over a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range 12-48). Last but not least, Mylona and co-workers (10) reported of a recurrence rate of 11% in 18 patients with lesions ranging from 1 to 7 cm in diameter. Over a mean follow-up time of 31.2 months (12-72 months) no recurrences were observed in lesions smaller than 3 cm in diameter. And what about renal function? It is known that thermal ablation is a nephron sparing technique, indicated by numerous papers about percutaneous ablations in patients with single kidneys or with reduced renal function. For example, in a patient subgroup with impaired renal function of the study by Stern and co-workers (8), the eGFR decreased from 76.3 and 74.3 mL/min/m(2) after radiofrequency ablation. Further advantages? It is known that thermal ablation does not require general anesthesia necessarily and thus can be offered especially to poor surgical candidates with reduced cardial or pulmonal function. Further, the mean hospitalization time is shorter than after resective surgery (2) . Finally, thermal ablation is more cost effective",

Especially in multimorbid patients, thermal ablation yields in good clinical results without deterioration of the clinical status. Literature reflects a broad clinical experience of curative and palliative ablation in patients with liver (1) as well as renal tumors (2). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most frequently applied of all methods. First described by Zlotta and co-workers in1997 (3) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . The 4 single arm pilot studies with doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead\u2122 showed very promising tumour response rates and low complication rates as well (19) (20) (21) (22) . In a multicenter, single blind, prospective, randomised, controlled study designed to assess the clinical performance of doxorubicin TACE with DC Bead\u2122 in the treatment of unresectable HCC in comparison with conventional doxorubicin TACE patients were randomised 1:1 to either doxorubicin TACE with the DC Bead\u2122 (test arm) or the conventional doxorubicin TACE (control arm) (PRECISION V Trial) (24) . Included were patients with HCC not suitable for resection, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation. Patients with multinodular or bilobar HCC were included, diffuse HCCs with >50% tumour involvement of the liver were excluded. Patients should have a performance status ECOG 0 (asymptomatic) and 1 (limited restriction of daily activities), and a well preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A and up to B7). Patients were excluded with vascular invasion and extra hepatic spread, with another primary tumour and if previously treated with radiotherapy or doxorubicin. DC Bead\u2122 TACE (test arm): Patients received DC Bead\u2122 loaded with doxorubicin at a dose of 150mg in each procedure. The aim of each procedure was be to deliver 2 x 2ml vials of DC Bead\u2122 (total 4ml) loaded at 37.5mg/ml of doxorubicin. It was recommended that chemoembolization should be performed with one vial DC Bead 300-500mm followed by one vial of 500-700mm in diameter. No adjustment was made for bilirubin concentration.",

            "text": "Particulate embolization of hypervascular tumors has been performed since the 1960s, based on earlier anatomical studies identifying the hepatic artery as the primary source of blood to hepatic malignancies. More sophisticated in-vivo videomicroscopy techniques elucidated that blood reaches hepatic tumors via a peribiliary capillary plexus with anastomoses from the hepatic artery to terminal portal venules. Penetration through this complex network requires a liquid agent. In the early 1970s, iodized ethyl esters of poppyseed oil (Lipiodol\u00ae) were found to be selectively taken up and in the cTACE arm. Cancer-related death due to disease progression within 6 months was observed in 1/102 versus 3/110 patients in the DC Bead\u2122 versus cTACE arm, respectively (24) . HCC is a highly chemotherapy-resistant tumour. However, doxorubicin has shown to have an efficacy when it is given intraarterially. In patients with predominant hepatic disease, intra-arterial therapy has been used mostly as salvage therapies after failure of IV standard of care therapies for metastases, and because response rate remains interesting even when using the same drug that the one which was or became inefficient with IV administration. Due to the high response rate of IAHC, there are some recent reports and ongoing study using such therapies in first line. In addition, IAHC used in an adjuvant setting after liver resection has been demonstrated to increase survival [1] . IAHC has the main advantage of increasing drug concentrations in tumor deposits, thus resulting in a significant increase in response rates because many tumors display a steep dose-response curve. When compared to IV perfusion the estimated increase in liver exposure by IAHC is 100-300 fold for FUDR, about 20 fold for THP adryamicin, 5 to 10 fold for 5FU, 4 to 7-fold for cisplatin, 6 to 8 fold for mitomycine, 4 fold for oxaliplatinum, and only 2 fold for doxorubicin. All clinical trials using 5 FU or FUDR have demonstrated a better response rate for IAHC than for IV treatments. Adjunction of embolization, and namely used of drug eluting beads during arterial therapy further enhanced drug concentration as demonstrated for doxorubicin [2] and irinotecan in our pre-clinical experience. In the past only few trials have demonstrated a benefit in survival [3, 4] . Intra-arterial chemotherapy was more or less abandoned at the time IV irinotecan and oxaliplatinum proved to give equivalent response rate to intra-arterial 5-FU. Then, oxaliplatin was used IAH and combined with IV 5FU, it demonstrated an overall response rate of 62% among the 39 assessable patients including 17, 12, and 12 patients who had failed to respond to prior systemic chemotherapy with FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, or both, respectively [5] . In this report, further R0 surgical resection can be proposed in 18% of initially unresectable CRLM and radiofrequency ablation in 2%. A triple combination including IAHC with FUDR plus IV oxaliplatinum and irinotecan allowed as high as 90% of tumor response [6] . More recently 49 patients with unresectable CRLM (53% previously treated with chemotherapy) were enrolled onto a phase I protocol with HAI floxuridine and dexamethasone plus systemic chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and irinotecan [7] . In this study, more than five CRLM were present in 73% of patients, 98% had bilobar disease, and 86% had six segments or more involved. Ninety-two percent of the 49 patients had complete (8%) or partial (84%) response, and 47% (23/49) of the patients were able to undergo resection in a group of patients with extensive retained in liver tumors when injected intra-arterially as a contrast agent. Chemoembolization using iodized Lipiodol\u00ae as a drug carrier was developed in the 1980s and is the global standard for treatment of primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. Water-in-oil emulsions of Lipiodol with anti-cancer drugs deliver drug intra-tumorally with prolonged retention times. Its opacity allows for real-time monitoring of therapy during embolization. Uptake and retention of Lipiodol is a validated imaging biomarker for both pathological tumor response and patient survival. Lipiodol chemoembolization is the only technique demonstrated by randomized controlled trials to improve survival in HCC. Newer polymeric embolic platforms have been developed that allow predictable drug loading, delivery, and elution with lower systemic drug exposure than oily emulsions. To date, all studies in HCC have failed to demonstrate improvement in tumor response or in patient survival compared to oily chemoembolization or to bland embolization. In the Precision V prospective randomized trial of dox-loaded PVA beads vs. oily chemoembolization, response by RECIST and necrosis criteria were the same in both arms. In a prospective randomized trial of dox-loaded PVA beads vs. unloaded beads for HCC, survival at 6, 9, and 12 months was identical. Major hepatobiliary complications occurred in 17% of patients receiving dox-loaded beads vs. 2% in those who had bland embolization. The learning curve with these new devices has been fraught with complications. Injuries to gut, gallbladder, pancreas, and cutaneous soft tissues have been reported due to non-target embolization of the non-opaque beads, whose delivery cannot be monitored in realtime like iodized oil. Hepatobiliary necrosis is an alarmingly frequent complication, reported in up to one-half of patients in some series. Since the beads are too large to penetrate the intratumoral vessels, they lodge outside the tumor and rely on passive diffusion for drug delivery to the tumor, resulting in excess drug deposition in normal hepatic parenchyma. Images of iron-labelled beads depict that they concentrate around tumor nodules with little penetration of the intratumoral vasculature, unlike Lipiodol which is selectively taken up and retained in HCC. Studies of tissue drug levels in animal models reveal highly toxic drug concentrations immediately surrounding dox-loaded beads, but sub-lethal drug concentrations in tumor. Even in experienced hands, the complication rate of DEBs exceeds QI guidelines for chemoembolization. While it is unlikely that this platform will prove superior to oily emulsions for treatment of HCC, far more interesting is the potential application for delivery of newer drugs such as irinotecan and paclitaxol to tumor types that traditionally have not been well managed by oily chemoembolization.

At 6 months, CR was 7%, PR was 35%, SD was 54% and PD was 4%, with 20% of patients downstaged to surgery or ablation. Pathological assessment of the resected specimens showed minimal nonspecific portal chronic inflammation without evidence of fibrosis, or chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis. The overall pathological response rate in the resected specimens ranges from 30 to 90%. ESMO 2010 reports 74 patients who failed at least two lines of chemotherapy randomized to DEBIRI 2courses at 1 month interval (n=36) versus 8 courses of IV FOLFIRI at 2 weeks interval (n=38) [11] . The response rates were 70% and 20%, the 2-year overall survival were 38% and 18%, the median overall survival were 690 days and 482 days and the progression-free survival were 225 and 94 days for DEBIRI and FOLFIRI respectively. Early toxicity \u2265grade 3) was higher for DEBIRI (70%) versus FOLFIRI (25%), while late toxicity (\u2265grade 2) was higher for FOLFIRI (80%) than DEBIRI (20%). Improvement of quality of life was 60% for DEBIRI and 22% for FOLFIRI. Overall cost of treatment was lower for DEBIRI. Around 30% of TACE sessions are associated with adverse events during or after the treatment. The factors predictive of adverse events and significantly greater hospital length of stay are lack of pretreatment with hepatic arterial lidocaine (p = 0.005), > or = 3 treatments (p = 0.05), achievement of complete stasis (p = 0.04), treatment with >100 mg DEBIRI in 1 treatment (p = 0.03), and bilirubin >2.0 microg/dl with >50% liver involvement (p = 0.05) [12, 13] . Hong et al recently compare TACE with DEBIRI to radioembolization for salvage therapy for liver dominant CRLM in a series of 36 patients and reports similar survival for both treatment as a salvage therapy with median survival times of 7.7 months for the TACE group and 6.9 months for the radioembolization group (P = .27). The 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 43%, 10%, and 0%, in the TACE group and 34%, 18%, and 0% in the radioembolization group [14] . ",

To understand basic pros and cons of CTA and MRA 3. To learn if and how the imaging would detect an atherosclerotic plaque which is more prone to create a stroke Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term morbidity. There are approximately one million stroke-related events per year in the US alone. Often atherothromboembolism from a focal atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bifurcation cause stroke and carotid stenosis and is often present in these patients. Commonly used imaging techniques for diagnosis of significant carotid artery stenosis include Doppler ultrasonography (DUS), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), MR angiography (MRA), and multislice CT angiography (CTA). DSA is still considered the standard of reference for evaluation of carotid artery stenosis. However, it comes with a risk of neurological complications, which is estimated to be in the range of 0.05 to 0.5%. DUS is not capable of imaging all vessels that are relevant for the brain's blood supply. Therefore, in clinical routine practice noninvasive imaging techniques such as MRA or CTA are widely used for establishing the diagnosis and subsequent treatment planning. Traditionally, the degree of luminal stenosis has been used as marker for the stage of disease. However, prospective clinical trials have shown that the majority of patients with a history of recent transient ischemic events or stroke suffer only mild-to moderate carotid stenosis. Using conventional stenosis criteria, in many of these symptomatic individuals the severity of disease would be underestimated. These patients would falsely be considered to have earlystage carotid artery disease. Consequently, improved criteria for identifying the high-risk carotid plaques independent of the extent of stenosis are needed. Histological studies from different vascular territories have led to the hypothesis that plaques with large lipidrich necrotic cores, thin fibrous cap, extensive plaque neovasculature, intraplaque hemorrhage and vessel wall inflammation pose an increased risk for plaque rupture and ischemic events. These plaques are considered \"vulnerable\". Despite the widespread consensus on the importance of the characteristics of the \"vulnerable plaque\", there is a lack of reliable imaging tools for in-vivo plaque characterization. Over the last decade MRA and more recently CTA have been identified as promising tools for assessing plaque morphology and composition in the search for the \"vulnerable plaque\". MRA and CTA may roughly be considered equal for assessing the degree of carotid stenosis [1] . However, MRA has been shown to accurately identify key carotid plaque features, such as a lipid-rich necrotic core, intraplaque hemorrhage, neovasculature and vessel wall inflammation [2] . In contrast, CTA proved perfect for identifying calcified lesions, but due to a relevant overlap in the attenuation values associated with lipid-rich necrotic core, connective tissue, and hemorrhage, its reliability for identifying these components is limited [3] . Almost a decade ago high-resolution MR imaging proved its ability to accurately classify human carotid atherosclerotic plaques according to the American Heart Association classification [4] . MRA therefore permits distinguishing advanced lesions from early and intermediate atherosclerotic plaques. data from the CRYSTAL study, response rate of 60% can be achieved in k-ras wild-type patients with an acceptable side-effect profile. While loco-regional therapies represent a potentially very active and potent treatment regimen, this type of treatment has not proven efficacy in large randomized trials. Treatment results largely depend on the experience of the individual interventional radiologist, which make it difficult to compare results. Furthermore, different types of interventional therapies are often combined, which make it impossible to relate the effects of a specific treatment to patients' outcome. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy has been defined to be the treatment of choice for non-resectable disease according to different national and international treatment guidelines, including the NCCN and ESMO guidelines. These recommendations are based on a number of different observations and facts, which will be discussed during my presentation and are summarized here: 1. Data from large randomized trials demonstrate that in less than 20% of all cases metastasis are restricted to the liver. Therefore, more than 80% of the patients with non-resectable disease will not profit from a liver directed therapy, since extra-hepatic tumors will without doubt progress without a specific treatment. 2. While-liver directed therapies might be able to achieve high chemotherapy concentrations in the liver, systemic dose levels are very low. 3. No clinical trial has shown a superior outcome (overall survival) for loco-regional therapy of systemic therapy in patients with stage IV disease and liver metastasis. 4. While liver-directed therapies are potentially very effective they also cause significant hepatotoxicity. Therefore, they cannot be used in a neo-adjuvant setting with the aim to achieve a response rate, which would allow for a curative resection after treatment. 5. In contrast to systemic therapy, which can either be given orally or at least on an outpatient base, loco-regional therapy requires specialized physicians to deliver the therapy of choice. 6. A number of different loco-regional therapies have been evaluated in patients with non-resectable disease. However, no standardtype of treatment has been established yet, which could potentially be compared with a systemic chemotherapy regimen. In summary, based on the results from large randomized clinical trials in patients with non-resectable colorectal cancer and liver metastasis, systemic chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice. However, loco-regional therapies remain a potentially very interesting treatment option considering the fact, that these type of treatments can be used to achieve high response rates. Furthermore, because patients with advanced colon cancer experience overall survival rates of more than two years, treatment-related side effects, which are known to increase in terms of frequency and severity over time, become an increasing problem in the management of patients with advanced disease. Under these circumstances, locoregional therapies might become a potentially interesting treatment alternative.",

Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA), on the other hand, had a two-year stroke risk of 9%. Thus, the absolute risk of stroke reduced by 17% at two years in symptomatic patients treated surgically. Similarly, the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Study (ACAS) showed that in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (60-99%), the annual incidence of stroke on medical therapy alone was 2.3% and that CEA reduced it to an annual risk of 1%. However, periprocedural risk of cranial nerve damage (5.6%), and other medical complications (8.1%) and myocardial infarction (1.2%) associated with CEA prompted the development of safer percutaneous methods as an alternative treatment in patients excluded from these trials. Major Carotid End Arterectomy (CEA) trials have confirmed the role of CEA in mitigating the risk of stroke. Carotid artery angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) is rapidly being affirmed in several centres as a valid alternative to CEA in selected patient subsets. The aim of our investigation was to evaluate the benefit of carotid angioplasty and stenting in preventing cerebrovascular disease in different groups of patients and to assess the feasibility and the safety of this technique. Materials and methods: We treated 1450 patients always using a protection device. We treated both symptomatic (60%) and asymptomatic patients (40%); each candidate was previously clinically evaluated by Neurologist and Angiologists. 60% stenosis was the cut off to select symptomatic patients and 80% was the cut off for asymptomatic patients. Results: Outcomes were evaluated on a mean follow-up of 47.4 months (range 6-118). In the periprocedural period (up to 30 days), 2.4% of patients of the symptomatic group had a minor stroke and 1.2% had a major stroke (one fatal stroke). 1.4% of the asymptomatic group had a minor stroke and 1.5% had a major stroke. 0.4% of patients died for cardiac reasons. The restenosis rate was 3% using a cut off of 50% of stenosis. Conclusion: Global stroke (symptomatic + asymptomatic) and death rate was 3.4%. In the symptomatic group we had 3.6% of all types of cerebral stroke and 2.9% in the asymptomatic group. Our findings demonstrate that carotid angioplasty is a safe procedure with a complication rate similar to surgical literature but with a lower incidence of cardiac complications. Our results are in line with those of recent randomised studies. It has been shown that \"vulnerable plaques\" are more prone to the slow flow phenomenon during carotid artery stenting (CAS) and intraplaque hemorrhage which is thought to be associated to embolization during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) [5] . These results, however, are (1) not yet confirmed by randomized studies and (2) unlikely to affect the need for treatment in case of a significant carotid artery stenosis. Nevertheless, reliable plaque analysis is likely to alter treatment decisions, particularly in patients with a limited degree of stenosis but high risk types of plaques. Due to the current complexity of MR plaque imaging, it is not yet widely used in clinical routine practice. Moreover, imaging is only one piece of the puzzle. A careful clinical workup with a thorough neurological assessment remains a mainstay in the diagnosis of carotid artery disease and the gatekeeper for imaging tests. So far MRA is the only candidate for an in-vivo assessment of the \"vulnerable plaque\". For several reasons there is no consensus of the use of such a test in clinical routine and several tasks lie ahead. Most importantly, a validated and generally accepted comprehensive plaque score is needed as foundation for future clinical trials. While, the available data on the prognostic impact of plaque imaging is promising, it is limited with respect to the number of patients and ischemic events. Thus, larger studies are needed to prove that specific baseline plaque features are associated with an increased risk for future ischemic events.",

To discuss pros and cons of single or multiple phase scans Reasons for follow up after EVAR In contrary to patients after surgical repair, patients after endovascular treatment of their aortic aneurysms require life time follow up imaging. There are different reasons for this need for follow-up: the life expectancy of the materials used for endovascular treatment might be limited -the first generation of stentgrafts has shown severe fractures of the used material. Additionally the chronic and progressive character of atherosclerosis can cause progression of aortic dilatation leading to movement of the prosthesis or insufficient aneurysm exclusion with time. Furthermore, endoleaks can generate further grow of the aneurismal sac even after stentgraft placement. Such endoleaks might appear even years after stentgraft placement. Finally, additional, unexpected findings like tumors should be detected during follow up. Reasons for using CTA for follow up after EVAR CT angiographies of the aorta using state of the art Multislice scanners represent very robust and easy to perform imaging studies. Once a routine imaging protocol has been established, this protocol can be performed with excellent results in every patient allowing for exact and reliable intra-patient comparisons during followup time as well as compared to the baseline examination, which is usually performed by using CTA. CTA's of large imaging volumes (for example the entire aorta) can be acquired with high spatial resolution in a very short acquisition time of less than20 seconds. The advantages of CTA compared to other imaging modalities include the high reliability, the good comparability to previous CTA studies and the high spatial resolution. However, disadvantageous for the use of CTA is the radiation exposure and the use of iodinated contrast agents, combined with the risk for causing contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients at risk, and most of the patients after stentgraft placement due to aneurysmatic disease are at risk for or suffer from impaired renal function. Within this presentation optimized imaging protocols for CTA's after stentgraft placement should be demonstrated including the implementation of state-of-the-art dose saving techniques. Additionally, optimized contrast-injection protocols should be discussed ",

To discuss pros and cons of CEUS vs. established modalities Endovascular repair (EVAR) is playing an increasing role in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm. A successful procedure depends on the complete sealing of the aneurysm sac from blood flow to achieve general pressure relief and avoid aneurysm rupture, with shrinkage of the aneurysm sac. However, many patients treated with EVAR require re-intervention in the middle and late follow-up. For this reason, a strictly surveillance of these patients is mandatory to early detect an endoleaks as well as other procedure-related complications. The standard of reference in the post-EVAR follow-up is represented by CT-angiography. However, CTA has limitations, principally represented by the radiation exposure. Therefore, it would be useful to have another reliable diagnostic examination during follow-up. CEUS seems to be a fast, non-invasive, less expensive, reliable and valid alternative to MSCT angiography for endoleak detection in endovascular aortic stent graft patients. It will be reviewed ultrasound contrast agents and contrast-specific imaging characteristics, in order to learn the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US) scanning technique and to illustrate its feasibility to obtain an early detection and treatment of eventual post-EVAR complications.",

            "text": "On CE-US images, the endoleak appears as a high attenuation area beyond the graft but within the aneurysm sac, absent on the baseline unenhanced phase images, due to the presence of contrast enhancement. The evaluation is based on visual assessment, without attenuation measurements, with particular attention to the endoleaks wash-in (defined as the time between beginning of contrast material injection and contrast visualization within the aneurysm sac), endoleaks wash-out (defined as the time between beginning of contrast material injection and disappearance of all contrast from the sac), the origin of the endoleaks as well as the identification of inflow and outflow collateral vessels. The enhancement morphology of endoleaks should be either as \"cavity filling\" (defined as contrast concentration into a pseudocavity within the sac) or a simple diffuse spreading of contrast agent into the thrombus. Recent literature demonstrated that, due to the longer duration of enhancement, lack of metallic artifacts and angio-dynamic evaluation of the leak during the dynamic phase, CEUS seems similar to MRA but more specific than CTA in detection of small low-flow endoleaks. In endoleaks classification, CEUS seems more specific than CTA and MRA thanks to longer duration of enhancement, lack of providing satisfactory diagnostic image quality with low contrast volumes. CTA after EVAR Due to the above mentioned need for life-time follow-up after endovascular stentgraft implantation, radiation exposure due to diagnostic imaging is an important issue to avoid relevant cumulative radiation doses to the patients. On the other hand maximal diagnostic information should be provided by any follow up examination. The main task for imaging after EVAR is the detection of treatment associated complications, disease progression and/or other relevant diseases. Treatment related complications are mainly described by growth of the aneurismal sac, the presence of endoleaks and stent fractures or occlusions of stentgraft legs, whereas disease progression might be described by the occurrence of new aneurysm in previously untreated parts of the arterial vasculature (iliac arteries, thoraco-abdominal aorta, visceral arteries) or by the occurrence of stenotic arterial lesions. Finally, unexpected, additional findings like tumors or stones should be detected. Imaging protocol for CTA after EVAR should therefore provide a sufficient compromise between diagnostic accuracy and reasonable low radiation dose exposition. Different protocols have been published in the scientific literature so far advocating the standardized acquisition of single, double or even triple phase imaging for follow up after stentgraft. The acquisition of a native scan might be advantageous to differentiate between calcifications and endoleaks as well as to allow for density measurements within the aneurismal sac in case of obscured endoleaks [1] [2] [3] . However, the substitution of the real native phase by a virtual noncontrast scan obtained using a Dual-Energy technique has been recommended recently [4] [5] . Additionally, even about the necessity of acquiring arterial and venous or arterial or venous phase imaging no clear guidelines do already exist within the literature [1] [2] [3] . In this presentation, an overview about the current literature on this question should be provided. Furthermore, the pro's and con's of single, double or triple phase scans should be discussed. By attending this presentation, the audience will receive information's about the state of the art CTA technique after EVAR including the incorporation of modern dose saving strategies and will learn about the advantages and disadvantages of acquiring multiphase scans in patients after EVAR.",

            "text": "Learning Objectives: 1. To define the problem of renal patient management 2. To discuss if and how MRA, CTA and DSA can be applied 3. To discuss how to medically and clinically support the patient before, during and after imaging/intervention Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CTA) has long been considered the gold standard to assess patients following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). CTA is used because it gives a comprehensive overview of the AAA sac, of the stent graft, and can readily detect complications. Most follow-up protocols involve assessing if the sac is shrinking, stable in size or increasing in size. Complications are then excluded by looking for evidence of endoleak, and if present attempting to classify it to assess risk of rupture. The shape, position and integrity of the stent graft can also be easily assessed. This allows identification of limb kinking that may lead to limb occlusion or dislocation. Migration can be assessed, prior to development of endoleak, and if the stent graft is fractured the impact can be monitored more closely. Unfortunately to carry out a detailed CTA examination requires the use of potentially nephrotoxic iodinated contrast, and this is problematic in those with renal insufficiency, especially as the repeated insult of multiple follow up studies can have an incremental deleterious effect on renal function. This presentation will examine how to mitigate the risks of using CTA in these patients. Various nephroprotective approaches can be tried. Adequate hydration is vital, and some have suggested that fluids and forced diuresis is useful. Antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine are widely used but the trial data are mixed. Other medical approaches include use of drugs that act upon the renal circulation, but the results are again uncertain. Statins also have theoretical benefits, but their effect is probably best felt in terms of secondary prevention of cardiac events. Alternatively do away with CTA altogether. Many now feel that use of CTA is not necessary for all cases following EVAR, and certainly not as frequently as cases were imaged in the past. Alternative approaches have been proposed with various simplified follow up imaging protocols mostly centred around the use of ultrasound as the primary imaging modality. Other approaches can use other imaging techniques, with MRI/MRA showing some promise. Non-contrast CT can also be considered, though as this will simply measure sac size, its advantage over Ultrasound assessment of sac size is questionable. All these approaches have the advantage of not requiring the nephrotoxic contrast used in CTA. Some protocols call for the use of CTA, especially early in the follow up following EVAR, but with the aim that use of other imaging modalities will reduce the proportion of cases and the frequency with which CTA is required. Some patients with renal insufficiency will inevitably require further assessment and treatment because of problems identified at follow up imaging, whatever follow up imaging method is used. If possible most will be treated using endovascular techniques, and conventionally this would require the use of iodinated contrast. If using digital subtraction angiography alternative contrast agents are available, and in the context of EVAR follow up carbon dioxide angiography is probably the most useful. This can often be used to help evaluate endoleak, as well as guide appropriate intervention. References: 1. Trivedi HS, et al. A randomized prospective trial to assess the role of saline hydration on the development of contrast metallic artifacts and angio-dynamic evaluation of the leak during the dynamic phase. CE-US is also similar to MRA and CTA in the evaluation of patency of stent-graft and distal iliac-femoral districts as well as in the assessment of sac aneurysm changes. However, CEUS also has some limitations: patient habitus (obesity) and bowel gas can interfere with imaging and the patient must cooperate. Moreover, sonographic examination results are operator-dependent and obtaining quality images requires training and specific skills. Furthermore, in the post-EVAR follow-up, CEUS cannot replace CT-angiography in providing information related to graft anchoring and integrity, aneurysm morphologic changes or visceral vessels patency (renal arteries). Our suggested post-EVAR follow up is based on CTA or MRA at 1 and 12 months after EVAR with CEUS performed at 6 months and annually thereafter, if no complications are detected. 16) . Prostheses were inserted in the biliary tract pushed by an introducer sheath (8Fr) for the 7Fr prostheses or a fragmented OASIS stent introduction system for the 10Fr prostheses coaxially over the guidewire, and were removed using a wire basket or a biopsy forceps. Results: Of 48 patients, 34 patients including one patient with total occlusion of hepatic artery are in good condition, one patient is still under treatment using plastic endoprostheses, one patient is scheduled for retransplantation due to deteriorated hepatic function, one patient passed away due to rupture of MCA aneurysm, four patients passed away due to multiorgan failure, and seven patients were lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Percutaneous transhepatic insertion and removal of plastic endoprostheses is a useful and feasible method for the management and treatment of non-anastomotic biliary stricture, and can improve the function of the graft and prolong the survival of the graft and the patient. Post-procedure dysphagia and reflux scores were better in ARS group; 1.7 (SD 0.9) and 0.8 (SD 0.8), respectively, as opposed to 2.4 (SD 0.7) and 1.2 (SD 1.1) in the SOS group. However, there was no statistical significance between the two groups, either in reflux (p=0.61) or dysphagia (p=0.29) when change from pre-procedure score was evaluated. Immediate complications were similar between the two groups. Late complications (stent migration, tumour ingrowth and stent fracture) were more common in the ARS group but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.23).",

The off-label use was approved by the drugs and therapeutics committee at The Christie. Results: 58 stent placements with embolisation were performed in 59 cancer patients, 11 were high risk for haemorrhage. 35 were done as a single, 24 as a staged procedure. The radiopaque paste could be administered accurately avoiding intraductal injection in all patients. There were no adverse events to the collagen and no procedural complications. Suspected post-PTC haemorrhage occurred in 3.4% (2/59) treated with transfusion only, compared to a national average of 6.1%. No biliary peritonitis or biloma occurred. No adverse effects from the collagen were seen, specifically no hypersensitivity or abscess formation. 30-day mortality was 20% (12/58), in line with national average as published through the Biliary Drainage and Stent Registry of the British Society of Interventional Radiology. Conclusion: Avitene flour is a cheap (approx. \u20ac 55.-) and easy method of embolising the transhepatic track.

They were randomly subdivided into two groups. In the first group (16 patients) , under local anaesthesia and US guidance, a needle was advanced into the enthesis of the common extensor tendon. There, we performed multiple punctures to obtain a scarification of the enthesis and of the preinsertional portion of the tendon. In a second group (16 patients) , an US-guided steroid injection was performed. A visual analogue scale was used to evaluate the degree of pain pre-and post-treatment at 2, 12, 24 and 48 weeks. Results: In the first group, no significant improvement compared with baseline was found at 2 weeks but was present at 12, 24 and 48 weeks (p < .001 for all). In the second group, significant improvement compared with baseline was found at 2 weeks (p < .001) but not at 12, 24 and 48 weeks. Comparison between the groups showed significantly different outcome in favour of the second group at two weeks (p < .001) and in favour of the first group at 12, 24 and 48 weeks (p < .001). Conclusion: US-guided percutaneous dry needling alone is more effective than steroid injection. The efficacy of this treatment seems to be long-lasting. It can be considered as an effective and minimally invasive treatment for lateral epicondylitis. Purpose: The development of a C-arm cone-beam CT unit coupled with flat detectors has markedly increased anatomic visualization capabilities for interventional radiology procedures. Our aim was to evaluate the reliability of a rotational angiographic unit (RA) with flat-panel detector as a single technique to guide percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and for post-procedure imaging processing by 2D and 3D reformatted images. Material and Methods: Twenty-five consecutive patients (35 vertebral bodies, 20 lumbar and 15 thoracic) were treated under RA fluoroscopy. Using a ceiling-mounted angiographer (Artis zee, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) rotational acquisitions with 2D and 3D (Software 3D Dyna CT) reconstructions were obtained in all patients for immediate post-procedure assessment with a dedicated workstation (Syngo Workstation, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Rotational CT acquisitions were used to evaluate the position of the needle during the procedure. Fluoroscopy time, patient exposure radiation dose, technical success of the procedures, mean procedure time, mean number of rotational acquisitions and complications were recorded. Results: In all cases, a safe trans-pedicular access and an accurate control of the bone-cement injection were successfully performed. No cement leakages were encountered. The mean (+/-SD) procedure time was 35,2+/-20,3 minutes, and the median fluoroscopy time was 4 minutes 58 seconds. Median number of rotational acquisitions was 3 and mean patient dose was approximately 6+/-1,3 mSv. There were minor complications (pain, small hematoma) in two patients (4.3%). Conclusion: PVP with 3D fluoroscopy with rotational CT acquisitions is a reliable and feasible technique reducing time of the procedure and allowing fast and cost-effective procedures with high rate of success. Purpose: To determine the risk of non-target vessel embolization and ischemic complications following embolotherapy with the liquid embolic agent ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx). Material and Methods: Between January 2004 and January 2011, one hundred ninety-nine patients underwent peripheral or visceral embolotherapy using the liquid embolic agent Onyx. All angiograms were retrospectively evaluated with respect to migration of Onyx into non-target vessels. In addition, all medical charts were reviewed to identify all patients who presented ischemic complications that required surgical or endoscopic intervention or prolonged hospital stay. Follow-up was performed until death or discharge from hospital. Results: Embolotherapy with Onyx was performed for treatment of acute arterial hemorrhage (83 patients), embolization of esophageal and gastral varices after TIPS creation (61 patients), preoperative tumor-embolization (10 patients), embolization of arteries prior to SIRT (10 patients), embolization of endoleaks (9 patients), embolization of AV-shunts (7 patients), embolization of aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms (6 patients) and miscellaneous indications (13 patients) . Migration of Onyx into non-target vessels occurred in five patients (2.5%). In these five patients no ischemic complications emerged. In four patients (2.0%) embolization with Onyx caused ischemic complications requiring surgical intervention (two times splenectomy, two bowel resections). Conclusion: Peripheral and visceral vessel embolization using the liquid embolic agent Onyx is safe and effective. To avoid complications specific material properties of Onyx have to be considered.

Galli Purpose: To show the effect of embolization therapy in patients with haemophilic sinovitis and haemarthrosis. Material and Methods: 23 patients, 2 with inhibitors, ranging from 12 to 56 y-o, presenting at least a minimum of 3 haemarthrosis events in 6 months, and sinovitis. We performed 26 procedures. Angiography of genicular arteries in the knee (18) and ulnar and radial arteries in the elbow (6) was followed by selective gelfoam or PVA particles embolization in blush or hypervascular lakes using standard endovascular technique. MR image was performed before and in 2 and 6 months control. Follow-up between 6 and 42 months, evaluating number of haemathrosis events, amount of coagulation, substitutive factors used and QOL. Results: All patients have QOL improvement and gaining effectiveness in physiotherapy. In the knee group the average of days without clinical events was 112\u00b176.8. These patients reduced the number of events and the severity of them and consumption of coagulation substitutive factors decreased (p<0.01) at 6 months in the whole study and (p<0.01) at 18 months in patients bleeding more than 3 events in 3 months. One patient had to be re-embolized at 6 months. Technical success was 96,15% without major complications and adverse effects. In the elbow group 1 patient had bad results and coincided with an insufficient technical embolization. Conclusion: In haemophilic patients with chronic knee/elbow sinovitis, endovascular embolization seems to offer a safe therapeutic option to treat haemarthrosis and reduce sinovitis.",

We developed a concept of LPS by placing multiple needles in the lesion that allow free circulation of the sclerosing agent; these needles work as multiple valves that allow an out flow of the sclerosing agent. Purpose: Low-flow vascular malformations (VM's) are typically treated using ultrasound/X-ray-guided percutaneous sclerotherapy. Many lesions cannot be seen with ultrasound and require multiple treatments and exposure to ionizing radiation. VMs can be easily identified and targeted using MR. MR can also be used to assess immediate post-procedural changes. We present our initial experience treating low-flow VMs using a 1.5T MRI/X-ray \"Miyabi\" suite. Material and Methods: Between 9/7/2010 and 2/3/2011 patients with VMs were enrolled due to an inability to find their lesion(s) using ultrasound. All MR-guided-interventions were performed on a 1.5T MRI (MAGNETOM Espree/Siemens)/X-ray angiography (Axiom Artis dFA/Siemens) \"Miyabi\" suite. After planning MR, all lesions were accessed under real-time MR using 20-22G MR-compatible needles (Cook/InVivo). Patients with lymphatic malformations were treated in the scanner with doxycyclene (10mg/cc) through the access needle. Venous malformations were injected with diluted Gadopentate Dimeglumine and imaged to assess for venous drainage, then transferred to the angiography unit where an injection of i-oxilan 350 was used to confirm MR findings, followed by treatment with anhydrous ethanol. Follow-up MR was then acquired. Results: Eight patients were enrolled (8-56 y. o.) with a total of 11 targeted malformations (6 venous/5 lymphatic). Of the 8 patients, 5 were treated, all with therapeutic response. Conclusion: Low-flow VMs can be safely and effectively treated using a 1.5 T MR system. Our goal is to improve the MR-imaging protocol and to eliminate the use of X-ray altogether. Our next steps will involve the further development of rt-HASTE sequence as well as of a FLASH sequences for assessment of lesion flow/outflow. underwent Ch-EVAR. 14 balloon-expandable stent-graft and 7 bare stents were implanted in the renal arteries, 5 patients had bilateral renal chimney-graft. In all 18 patients, 6-10 ml of fibrin glue was injected into the sac by a 5Fcath to obtain a complete thrombosis and avoid late type-2 leak. The results of the Ch-EVAR procedure were evaluated at 1, 6 and 12 months by a MSCT and serum creatinine at 24h, 6 and 12 months.",

An hourglass-shaped device was placed in the inferior vena cava, creating a chamber with access to the hepatic veins without interruption of the vena cava flow. A perfusion circuit between the hepatic veins and the proximal portal vein was then created while the portal vein and the hepatic artery were occluded by balloon catheters, thus isolating the liver. Retrograde isolated perfusion was then performed with 40 mg/m2 eloxatin. Two consecutive procedures were performed in the same patient within 6 weeks. Results: In both procedures, it was possible to insert, accurately position and retrieve all components of the PILP catheter set without angiographic evidence of leakage, vessel occlusion or dissection. Perfusion of eloxatin was performed without any sign of systemic side effects. After the intervention, transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase levels were transiently elevated during less than 14 days after the intervention. Pre-and post-operative CT scans did not disclose any sign of healthy liver tissue damage. Conclusion: For the first time in a human patient, repeated percutaneous isolated perfusion of the liver was achieved using the Liver-PILP system. Devices could be safely and accurately positioned, and successful vascular isolation of the liver was achieved. Disclosure: Consultancy agreement 1 1 Purpose: Radiofrequency-assisted intact specimen biopsy (RFIB) has been introduced for percutaneous biopsy or removal of breast tumors. Using radiofrequency cutting, the system enables the interventional radiologist to obtain an intact sample of the target lesion. According to IDEAL guidelines, we performed a critical evaluation of our initial experience with RFIB. Material and Methods: Between June and November of 2010, X-ray-guided RFIB was performed in 19 female patients. All patients presented with suspicious microcalcifications (BI-RADS III-V) on mammography. Biopsy specimen integrity, thermal damage and histological diagnosis were assessed by an expert breast pathologist. Data on technical success, diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy and peri-procedural complications were collected and analyzed according to the IDEAL guidelines. Results: Median age was 59 years. Median lesion diameter on mammography was 8 mm (range 2-76 mm). The procedure was successful in 17/19 (89%) patients and unsuccessful in 2/19 (11%) patients (1 nonrepresentative sample, 1 sample with extensive thermal damage). Histological analysis of the RFIB specimen revealed 12/19 (63%) benign lesions and 7/19 (37%) malignancies (4 DCIS lesions and 3 invasive ductal carcinomas). In 1 patient a DCIS lesion was completely removed with RFIB. Overall, 3 peri-procedural complications occurred (1 wound leakage, 1 arterial hemorrhage and 1 infection requiring oral antibiotics). Conclusion: Tissue sampling of suspicious breast lesions can be performed successfully with RFIB. In 1 patient DCIS was radically excised with RFIB, which illustrates its potential as a minimally invasive therapeutic procedure for removal of small breast tumors. This is an interesting focus for further research when larger probe sizes become available.",

Results: Procedural variables were comparably distributed between both groups. Technical success was 100% for both groups. To date, 6-month angiographic follow-up is available in 13 cases of both groups. unilateral great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux undergoing endovenous treatment were randomised to RFA or EVLT.

Secondary outcome measures were occlusion at 7 days, post-operative pain, analgesic requirement and bruising, assessed at day 7 following surgery. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed pre-operatively and 3 months following surgery using the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and EQ-5D. Results: 159 patients were randomised to RFA (79 patients) or EVLT (80 patients). Groups were well matched for demographics, disease extent, severity and pre-operative QoL. Duplex scanning confirmed 100% vein occlusion at 1 week in both groups. At 3 months occlusion was 97% for RFA and 96% for EVLT; P=0.67.

We evaluate its technical success, clinical effectiveness, primary and secondary patency, asymptomatic period following the procedure and overall survival period in a large group of patients. . SVC was primarily stented in 205, balloon dilated in 1, interventional attempt was unsuccessful in 11 cases. Patients were invited back upon recurrence of symptoms. Results: All successful interventions lead to immediate relief of symptoms. No peri-procedural mortality occurred. 1 SVC rupture, 1 stent fracture, 2 hemopericardium, 1 pericardial puncture were solved percutaneously. Reocclusion occurred in 12 cases (including 5 and 3 times in a single patient), 2 days-2.5 months after the procedure, thrombolysis reintervention. Restenosis was reported in 10 cases (including 5, 3 and 2 times in a single patient), 2 weeks-9 months following the procedure, re-PTA).",

However, significant difference was found with respect to the BMI (26.3 vs. 29 .4 kg/m 2 ; p = 0.01). Conclusion: Obesity seems to be an independent risk factor for failure of vascular closure using the Angio-Seal after antegrade puncture of the CFA.

Material and Methods: Microbubbles (1.2\u03bcm) and 200nm nanoparticles were prepared containing 14-C doxorubicin. Microbubbles, nanoparticles, a combination of the two, or free doxorubicin were administered intravenously in rats with hepatomas while tumors were insonated for 20 minutes. Plasma doxorubicin levels were measured over 30 minutes, and in various organs and the hepatomas at 4 hours, 7 and 14 days. Explanted tumors were measured and evaluated by autoradiography and histology. Results: Animals treated with microbubbles had significantly lower peak plasma concentrations (0.4661 \u00b1 0.0684%/ml) compared to nanoparticles (1.6495 \u00b1 0.2936%/ml, p=0.0052) and free doxorubicin (3.0328 \u00b1 0.6120%/ml, p=0.0019). After 14 days, levels in the heart were significantly lower in animals treated with microbubbles compared to free doxorubicin (0.1676%/g tissue vs. 0.3198%/g, p=0.0088). Tumors treated with microbubbles showed significantly higher drug levels than tumors treated with free doxorubicin after 4 hours (4.1739 \u00b1 0.8397 ng/mg tissue vs. 0.4162 \u00b1 0.0969 ng/mg tissue, p=0.0472). Tumor concentration of dox in the micobubble group exceeded the lethal IC50 for HCC. These tumors showed no significant increase in size over 14 days, and significantly less growth than tumors treated with free doxorubicin (p=0.0390). Autoradiography showed dense doxorubicin deposition in the microbubble group at 14 days, and none in the nanoparticle and free dox groups. Conclusion: Doxorubicin-loaded microbubbles triggered with ultrasound provided enhanced, sustained drug delivery to hepatomas, reduced plasma and organ doxorubicin levels, and arrested tumor growth.",

Material and Methods: Extrahepatic collaterals to HCC were retrospectively assessed in 516 patients who received conventional celiac and superior mesenteric arteriography prior to embolization. If the mass nearby diaphragm, additional selective phrenic, right adrenal, right intercostal or internal mammary artery angiography was performed in 121 patients. All data were analyzed to study the extrahepatic collateral features of HCC. Results: 196 cases of all patients had extrahepatic collateral feeders to HCC. The sources were 34.7% from right inferior phrenic artery, 26.0% from gastro-duodenal and omental, 21.4% from left gastric, 12.2% from pancreatic-duodenal arc, 1.0% right colic, 2.6% right internal mammary, 1.5% intercostal artery and 0.5% from dorsal pancreatic artery. Extrahepatic collateral feeders were very close to the primary location, mass size and surgical interventions. These results denoted that parasitic blood feeding of the masses in segments VII and VIII was usually from right inferior phrenic or adrenal artery, that in segments IV, V, VI was from the gastro-duodenal and omental artery, and that in segments II, III, IV from the left phrenic or gastric artery. The technical success rates of those collateral arterial embolizations were 97.2% in 182 cases. Conclusion: Being familiar with the characteristics of extrahepatic collaterals and mastering their rules is paramount to successful arterial embolisation in the treatment of HCC. Only in that way we can raise up the survival rate of the patients with HCC.",

Material and Methods: 88 patients (49 females, mean age 47 \u00b1 11.1 years) with painful shoulder and ultrasound diagnosis of CTRC were prospectively randomised. Group A (n = 44) underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous treatment of CTRC (local anaesthesia, double-needle saline lavage and calcium aspiration, intrabursal steroid injection) using saline at room temperature, group B (n = 44) underwent the same treatment with saline at about 42 \u00b0C. Duration of procedure was recorded and ease of calcium dissolution was subjectively scored 1 (easy), 2 (intermediate), or 3 (difficult). Ultrasound appearance of the calcium deposit was judged as hard, soft, fluid. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for patients' discomfort. Results: Procedure duration was significantly lower (P=.030) in group B (544\u00b1241s) compared to group A (791\u00b1311s). Calcium dissolution was significantly improved (P=.034) in group B (median score 1) compared to group A (median score 2); in the subgroup with hard deposits (group A, n=14; group B=16), ease of calcium dissolution was larger and more significant (P<.001).

Systematic analysis was performed with contrast (0.5 ml) of the presumed diffusion space under CT control, before corticoids injection, and identification of an eventual vascular leak, either within the subarachnoid spaces or within the synovial articular capsule. Results: The venous vascular contamination represents the most important risk: contrast passage within the foraminal, intracanalar epidural vein, or also through the muscular deep veins, distant from the cervical canal (14%, 64/450): CT depiction of abnormal contrast stagnation in a homo-or contra-lateral side. The total absence of any visible contrast during CT control must evoke a radiculo-medullary artery contamination, a very rare condition (1.3%, 6/450). In all cases, the needle must absolutely be repositioned, with a new contrast control. The contrast injection of the articular capsule is very frequent, without any danger (18-20%, 81-90/450) . The reach of a radicular meningeal sheath is exceptional. No neurological complications were observed in this 10-year series. Conclusion: The good knowledge of the presumed diffusion space (contrast) is absolutely necessary, routinely, in case of cervical infiltration with corticoids.

Rose 1 Purpose: We hypothesized improved tumor control with intra-arterial delivery of supradose cisplatinum, and that toxicity could be minimized with simultaneous systemic administration of thiosulfate to bind free cisplatinum. The purpose of this presentation is description of the technique and preliminary results of this phase I study. Material and Methods: Eligible patients had locally advanced nonresectable primary or metastatic malignancies of the lungs or pleura that were refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Thoracic CT angiography was performed to identify feeding arteries. 1 or 2 feeding arteries were catheterized, angiography performed including cone beam CT, flow rate of the feeding artery determined, and cisplatinum infused at 150 mg/m 2 . Simultaneously, intravenous sodium thiosulfate was administered at 9 gm/m 2 . A second dose was similarly administered two weeks later. Tumor response was assessed one week after the second treatment using CT RECIST criteria. Results: 5 patients have been treated to date (metastases [3] , nonsmall cell lung cancer [1] , and mesothelioma [1] ). Arteries infused: bronchial [8] , intercostal [2] , internal mammary [2] , and lateral thoracic [1] . 4 of 5 patients tolerated both chemoinfusion sessions; 1 developed grade 2 nausea and declined further study participation. 1 patient was hospitalized with a grade 3 cough. Tumor responses were 2/5 partial response, 2/5 stable disease, 1/5 CT pending. 1 patient with mesothelioma had reduction of chest wall pain. Conclusion: Intra-arterial supradose cisplatinum infusion appears to be feasible to treat locally advanced primary and metastatic pulmonary and pleural cancers. Toxicity appears to be tolerable. Safety and efficacy will be assessed with further patient accrual.",

Material and Methods: Between August 2009 and December 2010, 198 consecutive patients were enrolled. Including criteria were lesions >1cm, distant from vital anatomical structures (cardiovascular and respiratory), needing a histological assessment in patients with good performance status. Patients were randomly assigned to group A (129, SIRIO technique) and group B (69, STANDARD technique). Technical success, number of CT scans, dose absorption by the patients and time procedure length were evaluated in both groups. The t Student test was performed. A p value less than 0.05 was interpreted as statistically significant. Results: Technical success was always obtained. Scans number was 3.4+/-1.5 for SIRIO vs 6+/-4 for STANDARD technique. The mean dose of ionizing radiation administered to the patient was 34mGy for SIRIO vs 61mGy for the STANDARD technique. Time procedure length was 14+/-7 minutes for SIRIO vs 25+/-12 minutes for traditional biopsies. For these data the p value was less than 0.05. Conclusion: SIRIO resulted in a reduced number of CT scans to reach the target lesion, thus minimizing procedure length time and ionizing radiation absorption. Comparing the accuracy of the biopsies in both groups, no differences were noted.",

Sofocleous 1 Purpose: To assess whether histopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue adherent to radiofrequency (RF) ablation electrodes after ablation of lung malignancies is feasible and indicative of local tumor progression (LTP). Material and Methods: Institutional Review Board approval and patient consent were obtained. Using proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (caspase-3) markers, histologic and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue adherent to RF electrodes post-ablation was performed. Medical records and imaging were examined to determine LTP. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan Meier Method. Multivariate analysis of factors related to LTP was performed. Results: Forty-nine lung malignancies from 44 patients treated with RF ablation were identified. Thirty-two specimens were classified as coagulation necrosis (CN) and seventeen as tumor cells, positive for Ki-67 (viable). Mean tumor size was similar between groups. For viable and CN groups, LTP was seen in 9/17 (53%) and 10/32 (31%) specimens, respectively. The median PFS for large tumors (> 2 cm) is 9 and 56 months for viable tumor and CN groups, respectively (p=0.033). The median PFS for small tumors (\u2264 2 cm) is 18 months for viable tumor group and is never reached in the CN group (p=0.024). Total median PFS was 27 months and median OS was 57 months. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue adherent to ablation electrode after pulmonary RF ablation can help predict clinical outcome. Evidence of Ki-67-positive tumor cells on the electrode is a strong predictor of LTP with a shorter PFS.",

After RFA, PET/CT was performed at 1 and 3 months, and lung CT scan at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months irrespective of the result of PET/CT at 3 months (P3). Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were recorded. The gold standard was biopsy at 3 months or follow-up at 12 months. For qualitative analysis, P3 was considered positive if the lesion uptake was greater than mediastinal background. ROC curve analysis for SUVmax was also done. Primary endpoint is accuracy of P3. Overall survival (OS) and time to local relapse was computed from RFA date using Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Between 2005 and 2009, 88 patients (mean age 65y) underwent RFA for 115 lung metastases (mean size 16.3 mm (5-38) ). The median SUVmax before RFA was 5.6 (1. 1-35.8) . P3 and gold standard were available for 77 patients and 101 lesions. With a P3 SUVmax cut-off of 2.4, sensibility is 87.5 %, specificity 54.1% and accuracy 59.4%. Area under ROC curve is 0.74. OS is 93% at 1y, 78.1% at 2y. Local relapse was observed for 16 patients (2 after 12 months). Local control is 83.4% at 1y, 79.3% at 2y. Conclusion: Specificity of P3 SUVmax is low because of persistent inflammation, especially when the lesion is close to the pleura and uptake pattern has to be also considered for better prediction of relapse. Purpose: Early portal vein thrombosis is one of the most frequent surgical complications after pediatric liver transplantation. It can be potentially devastating and lead to graft failure. We describe a combined treatment in the early portal vein thrombosis after liver transplantation without rebuilding the portal anastomosis. Material and Methods: From November 2006 to October 2009, five children weighing less than 10 kg with biliary atresia and portal vein hypoplasia were transplanted developing early complications of the portal vein within the first 72 hours posttransplantation. Four patients developed thrombosis and one portal flow absence secondary to collaterals steal flow. In the Surgery theater, through the previous laparotomy a vascular sheath was placed in the ileocolic vein (n=2), inferior mesenteric vein (n=1) or graft umbilical vein (n=1). The sheath was exteriorized through the wound (n=2) or a different transabdominal wall puncture (n =3). The angio-suite, the portal clots were mechanically fragmented with an angioplasty balloon. In three patients competitive collaterals were embolized with coils and in one a stent was placed. Thereafter, a transcatheter continuous drip of heparin was infused. Results: One patient developed recurrent thrombosis 24 hour later and it was solved with the same technique. The sheaths were removed surgically at a mean of 10.6 days. All patients had portal vein patency at the end of follow-up. Conclusion: Treatment of the early portal vein complications after pediatric liver transplantation with a combined treatment is feasible and effective.",

Technical success, outcome, and stent patency of present study were almost near to other published data. Purpose: To describe the signs and symptoms of graft overperfusion syndrome, and therapeutic interventions used successfully to treat this condition in a major metropolitan children's hospital and transplant center. Material and Methods: Since 2000, 78 living donor liver transplants have been performed at our children's hospital. Of these, 2 (1M:1F) have subsequently developed high output ascites within one week of transplantation. Both were 7 yr of age. One had hepatic fibrosis secondary to polycystic kidney disease, the other had cirrhosis secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis. Ascites output was 3-13 liters/d, accompanied by splenomegaly, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia and hepatocyte ballooning. Both patients underwent perfusion-reduction procedures: interventional partial splenic embolization followed by TIPS in patient 1, and surgical splenectomy in patient 2. Results: After 20 mo (patient 1) and 15 months (patient 2), both patients are stable at home. Ascites, coagulopathy, and hyperbilirubinemia have resolved completely. The 6-mm TIPS shunt remains patent with flow in the expected direction. Neither patient has required retransplantation. Conclusion: Correct diagnosis of graft overperfusion syndrome and perfusion reduction interventions can successfully resolve lifethreatening intractable ascites and coagulopathy. Because graft overperfusion syndrome has not been previously recognized as a reason for graft failure in small children, its recognition and appropriate treatment can be both life-saving and graft-preserving.",

Koizumi 1 Purpose: Prior to balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO), balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous venography (BRTV) using liquid iodine contrast media is usually used to identiy the gastric varices (GV). On the other hand, foam sclerosants have been applied for BRTO to reduce the sclerosants' dose and related hemolysis. However, physiological property of foam is completely different from liquid iodine contrast media; the latter is heavier while the foam is lighter than blood and ascends into the more ventral GV. The visualization of foam sclerosants is also difficult on fluoroscopy. Thus, we introduced digital subtraction angiography using carbon dioxide gas (CO 2 ) to estimate the distribution of foam sclerosants before BRTO. Material and Methods: For nine patients with GV, BRTO using foam sclerosants was attempted. After temporary balloon occlusion at gastro-renal shunt, BRTV was performed using conventional liquid iodine contrast first and then CO 2 second. These BRTV were repeated after downgradings or changing the catheter positions. Each grade on Hirota's classification (grade 1; GV only, 2; GV>collaterals, 3; GV<collaterals, 4; collaterals only) was compared. When GV were opacified on CO 2 -BRTV, foam sclerosants were injected. Results: Fourteen BRTV were performed for nine patients. The grades on CO 2 -BRTV (1.6\u00b10.8) were significantly (p<0.01) smaller than the grades on iodine-BRTV (3.6\u00b10.6). In all patients complete thrombosis of GV was obtained without any complication. Conclusion: CO 2 -BRTV provides good simulation of BRTO using foam sclerosants.",

Primary patency at one-year follow-up was 79.5% and 66.7%, respectively, in patients treated with and without stent (p=0.02). Re-occlusions occurred in 147 patients treated by SIA alone (47%) and 27 patients treated by SIA and stent (32%) (p=0.02). Successful recanalization rate was higher for patients treated by SIA alone (95%) compared to patients in whom stent was released (81%) (p=0.04). Feasibility of stent recanalization was higher in patients treated by a stent released in contact with the true lumen (p=0.02). Conclusion: SIA is a feasible and effective primary treatment for patient with TASC II D superficial femoral and popliteal artery lesions. The use of stent in subintimal angioplasty improves primary patency compared to SIA alone treatment. Stent position affects the technical approach for a second recanalization after stent occlusion.",

Goverde Purpose: We want to report the technique of percutaneous closure with the Abbott StarClose device of inadvertent subclavian artery catheterization lesions. This iatrogenic trauma during central venous access procedures can lead to serious morbidity or mortality. Material and Methods: From 2007 up till now, we had 10 patients with an accidentally catheterized subclavian artery with a 7 Fr. triple lumen catheter. All patients were critically ill. Because manual compression or surgical intervention was not a first option, we removed the catheter and closed the puncture lesion with a StarClose device (Abbott Laboratories, Redwood CA ). First we prepare a retrograde brachial access, as a bail-out system. Then a wire is placed in the brachial artery and one in the misplaced catheter. Catheter is removed and the StarClose introducer is inserted, followed by percutaneous closure of the lesion with a StarClose. Results: Nine procedures went all well. Control angiography showed no problems at the lesion/closure site in the subclavian artery. In one patient the closure failed because of a perforated side branch, this was treated with covered stent placement. Follow-up showed no early or late complications. Two patients died less than 30 days post-procedure (not intervention related). Conclusion: Using a StarClose closing device can be a safe alternative for the traditional therapies like compression, surgical intervention, covered stent placement or other endovascular treatment for a subclavian artery catheterization lesion. This type of percutaneous closure is furthermore cost reducing, less invasive and can lower the high morbidity and mortality of this complication. Purpose: Transradial approach (TRA) for iliofemoral interventions is appealing, allowing early deambulation and preventing haemorrhagic complications. However, its universal application is limited by a steep learning curve, as well as by the characteristics of the devices (catheter length). We present the results obtained during the last 4 years in performing percutaneous revascularizations on the iliofemoral territory through the TRA. Material and Methods: Single-center observational study. Population: all the consecutive patients with proximal iliofemoral non-occlusive disease, referred for percutaneous revascularization and a planned intervention through the TRA. Between March 2006 and November 2010, transradial iliofemoral interventions were attempted in 125 patients. 6 cases with common iliac occlusion were excluded from the study. The remaining 119 patients (97% male, mean age 64) are included in the analysis. Endpoints were technical success and access-site vascular complication rate. Results: Technical success was obtained in 99% of the cases. The TRA was left in 104 cases (87%), right in 10 (9%), and bilateral in 5 (4%). The number of lesions treated was 163 (1.37/patient: common iliac 43%, external iliac 48%, common femoral 5%, superficial femoral 4%). Only-balloon angioplasty was performed in 29 lesions (18%). In the remaining 134 lesions, a total of 153 stents were implanted (balloon-expandable 29%, nitinol self-expandable 71%). Complications related to the vascular access were: 15 asymptomatic radial artery occlusions (13%); 2 reabsorbed forearm haematomas; and 1 traumatic peripheral neuropathy. Conclusion: TRA for proximal iliofemoral percutaneous interventions is safe and feasible, with low minor complications, and high technical success rate.",

Material and Methods: Two different strategies of infrapopliteal placement of drug-eluting stents were examined. The first included provisional use of Sirolimus-eluting stents after suboptimal balloon angioplasty (group S) and the second primary Everolimus-eluting stenting (group E). Infrapopliteal balloon angioplasty and bailout bare metal stenting served as the control group in both cases. Standard survival methods (Kaplan-Meier analysis) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards regression analysis) statistical testing were applied to calculate overall patient event-free survival defined by the absence of any major events of death, major amputation or 515 C RSE CIRSE Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course target limb repeat procedures. The event-free survival curves were reconstructed from published infrapopliteal series. \u03a4he mean survival gain was estimated from the respective area under the curve (AUC method by the trapezoidal rule) and the event-free survival gain per patient was calculated. The number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to avoid one major event and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for a 3-year post-procedural period. Conclusion: USAT is a safe and effective treatment for PE. Clinical outcomes were improved with no mortality, even with a reduced total dose of rt-PA to 21 mg. Simultaneous upper extremity (brachial approach) and central venograms (femoral approach) defined the central occlusion site. The PowerWire TM RF wire was advanced within a 5-Fr KMP catheter. A pre-stent 4mm balloon angioplasty was followed by 10-12mm stent placement. If the RF wire puncture was inadequate, a new location was pursued. There were clinical and venograms follow ups at 30 days and then at 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: 29 patients were successfully treated with RF wire after previous failed attempts at recanalization using mechanical catheter/wire techniques. In two patients the procedure was aborted, in one due to hemothorax successfully treated with chest tube without clinical repercussions. All the successfully treated patients had resolution of symptoms in a 7 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) months mean follow-up. 2/29 patients had stent occluded in 30 days and 27/29 stents were patent at 6 months and the patients were asymptomatic. Conclusion: RF wire is a safe alternative in benign chronic central venous occlusions when conventional techniques failed and may provide good vessel patency rate.",

Follow-up imaging evaluation of differential regional tumor response was used to evaluate clinical outcome. Results: After embolization, reestablishment of intrahepatic arterial supply was confirmed by both DSA and CACT in 94% of territories, and by scintigraphy in 96%. In 32% of patients, we were not able to evaluate the differential response of treatment due to uniform disease progression. However, symmetric regional tumor response in 94% of evaluable patients indicated successful delivery of microspheres to the territories previously supplied by parasitized EHAs. Conclusion: Reestablishment of intrahepatic arterial inflow to hepatic tumors by embolization of parasitized EHAs is safe and effective, and results in successful delivery of 90 Y microspheres to tumors previously perfused by parasitized EHAs.

Material and Methods: 29 out of 304 patients (9.5%) were identified who underwent repeat assessment for RA as a result of GI MAA accumulation despite protective coil embolization of extrahepatic vessels. Initial and repeat angiograms as well as MAA scans were carefully reviewed to assign the site of GI MAA deposition to the responsible vessel and to evaluate the effectiveness of repeat assessment in order to eliminate extrahepatic MAA accumulation. Results: At repeat angiography the source of extrahepatic flow was identified in 27 of 29 patients (93.1%). This was most frequently the right gastric artery (RGA; n=14; 51.8%) or small pancreaticoduodenal branches originating from a residually perfused stump of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA; n=4; 13.8%). In 18 patients (62.1%) successful embolization was achieved, in 9 patients (31.0%) MAA had to be given from a very distal position as catheterization of the target vessel was repeatedly not feasible. Afterwards, extrahepatic MAA deposition was eliminated in 26 patients (89.7%) and RA could be performed in 22 cases (75.9%) in both liver lobes, in another 4 cases (13.8%) in the right lobe. Conclusion: RA can be performed in most patients with initial MAA accumulation to the GI tract. Protective embolization of the RGA and the proximal GDA were of paramount importance to reduce the rate of repeat assessments.",

Material and Methods: From January 2008 to January 2011, 111 cases of SIRT with Y-90 were performed in 102 patients. In 77 cases, catheter-directed IACT using a hybrid 16-slice-CT/angiography system was used in addition to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and technetium-99m-macroaggregated-albumin scintigraphy (Tc99-MAA) to guide infusion of Y-90 (IACT-group). In 31 cases, only DSA and Tc99-MAA were used (non-IACT-group). In 3 cases Dyna-CT was used in adjunction to DSA and Tc99-MAA and these were excluded from the study. Procedural images and electronic records were analyzed retrospectively to retrieve data on position of infusion of Y-90, coiling rates and patterns and complications due to non-intentional radiation to extra-hepatic organs. Results: Compared to the non-IACT-group, the coiling rates of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) and right gastric artery (RGA) were lower for the IACT-group: 6.5% (n=5) versus 19.4% (n=6) (p=0.074) and 5.2% (n=4) versus 12.9% (n=4) (p=0.22), respectively. The use of IACT-group resulted in a higher rate of detection and subsequent coiling of hepatic artery branches with supply to extra-hepatic organs: 14.3% (n=11) versus 9.7% (n=3) in the non-IACT-group (p=1.0). The complications related to inadvertent infusion into extrahepatic branches were 3,9% (n=3) in the IACT-group versus 6,5% (n=2) in the non-IACT-group (p=0.62). Conclusion: The additional use of IACT for planning of Y-90 infusion enables reduction of prophylactic coiling of the GDA and RGA and is of added value in picking up hepatic artery branches with supply to extra-hepatic organs.",

During follow-up, 3 patients died of which 2 were treated conservatively (P=ns). Conclusion: Although consensus is that infected graft material should be completely removed, this study shows no difference in mortality between conservatively and the surgically treated patients, which may suggest a role for conservative treatment in selected cases. Purpose: Accessory renal polar arteries (RPA) are found with a frequency of up to 30% within the general population. In infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysms the lower RPAs typically are covered by the stent-graft during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The study's aim was to evaluate renal function after covering of PRAs during EVAR. Material and Methods: In a retrospective trial serum creatinine levels and two-phase computed tomographic (CT) scans of 129 patients undergoing EVAR were obtained. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease study equation (MDRD) . Creatinine levels and GFR were monitored before, during hospital stay and 6 months after surgery. CT scans before surgery and during follow-up were evaluated for renal infarction, size and patency of RPAs. Results: In 31 patients 34 RPAs were covered. CT follow-up showed patent RPAs in all cases though their size was reduced. Renal infarctions were apparent in 17 RPA-patients. No case of renal failure requiring dialysis was observed. In the post-operative course the GFR decreased in 19 patients (61%) of the RPA-group for 19.3\u00b110.2 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2 on average, contrasting with 27 (27%) patients in the control group (15.3\u00b110.6 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2). For a ratio of polar to renal artery size <0.5 GFR decreased 4.4\u00b124.6 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2, for a relation >0.5 it decreased 9.6\u00b117.6 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2. This was not explained by segmental renal infarctions or the amount of contrast agent applied. Conclusion: Coverage of lower renal polar arteries during EVAR led to a decrease of the GFR, especially in case of a great ratio of polar to renal artery size. Purpose: Achieving proximal landing zones for hybrid endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta requires supra-aortic debranching (SAD) prior to delivery of stent-grafts (TEVAR). Hybrid strategies may offer improved patient outcomes compared to traditional repair; however, longer-term studies to assess patency of these extra-anatomic bypass grafts and outcomes are required. We report our experience of the hybrid approach to the aortic arch.",

Dynamic ECG-gated datasets were acquired with a low-dose acquisition protocol using a 0.625-mm-slice-collimation and 1.25-mm reconstruction-increment (40mL iomeprol 400mgI/mL, Iomeron\u00ae-400, Bracco). Manual CTA measurements of aortic neck length were performed on reformatted coronal images by three independent readers, in order to determine the conformational changes obtained during cardiac cycle. Results: A total of 40 patients were enrolled. Significant aortic longitudinal pulsatility was demonstrated within the aneurysm neck (mean variation: 19.1\u00b18.6%; absolute change: 5.3mm\u00b11.8mm). On the basis of dynamic measurements, the type of endograft selected on the basis of static images, in terms of fixation, would be potentially changed in 8/40 (20%) patients, whereas 4 patients (10%) were not considered eligible for EVAR in terms of aortic neck length. Conclusion: Dynamic ECG-gated CT-imaging may provide information regarding longitudinal pulsatile motion that could change the EVAR planning based on static imaging. Furthermore, the previous reported post-EVAR elongation of the infrarenal aortic neck seems to be a unreal phenomenon only due to a conformational changes during the cardiac cycle.",

Material and Methods: 42 patients with acute (<14 days) iliofemoral-popliteal DVT were prospectively randomised to either interventional therapy (PAT followed by anticoagulation) (n: 21) or to medical therapy (n: 21) (anticoagulation alone). Demographic data were similar in both groups. All patients underwent sonography of the lower extremities. PAT was performed with large bore guiding catheters (9F). Balloon angioplasties (n: 19) and stent placements (n:14) were performed after PAT for the residual stenotic segments (>50% luminal narrowing). Clot removal rates were measured with venography. Pre and post treatment (3rd month follow up) Doppler US and clinical symptom scorings were compared between two groups. Results: Complete clot extraction was achieved in 19 patients (90,4%) with PAT. Prophylactic IVC filters were placed in 2 patients. Primary patency rates at 3rd month were 91.7% in the intervention group and 28.6% in the medical group. Clinical symptom scorings were significantly improved in the intervention group (4,23 pretreatment; 0,82 posttreatment) whereas no significant change was observed in the medical group (4,00 pre-treatment; 2,86 post-treatment). During follow-up pulmonary embolism was observed more in the medical group (n:4) than intervention group (n:1). No serious adverse events occurred in both groups. Conclusion: Percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy (PAT) is a safe, feasible and cost effective endovascular technique with low major complication rates.

It allows maintaining adequate blood oxygenation without visible movements of the thorax in patients under general anesthesia. Material and Methods: From our experience of 22 RF tumor ablations (6 lungs, 12 livers and 4 kidneys) performed under general anethesia with HFJV we wish to illustrate the principle of this technique and its potential benefits. Results: HFJV yields complete immobility of the patient during the procedure. During lung tumor ablation, the intra alveolar pressure is lower than it is with conventional ventilation. Therefore some advantages can be taken from HFJV: -It makes localization of the lesion easier -It makes needle positioning quicker -Since the intra alveolar pressure in the lungs is low we might expect lower pneumothorax rates during lung RFA -Since no apnea or specific respiratory maneuvers are needed, it Purpose: Options for patients with unresectable NET liver metastases are few; response to medical/focal therapies is limited. CS:PHP could improve outcomes. Material and Methods: CS:PHP with high-dose melphalan was administered into the hepatic artery with simultaneous extracorporeal hemofiltration of hepatic venous effluent with blood return via internal jugular vein. Patients received \u00a34 cycles of melphalan (2.5-3.0mg/kg) q4-5 weeks in 2 NCI-IRB-approved studies. Patients had MNET, limited treatable extra-hepatic disease, adequate hepatic reserve, no portal hypertension, adequate vascular access. Primary objective was response rate; others: peri-procedural events, AEs and PFS. Results: 23 patients had median 15 lesions; 9 minimal extra-hepatic disease, majority pancreatic MNET (n=17). Liver tumor involvement was <25% in 12 patients, 25-50% in 5, >50% in 6. Median cycles were 3/patient, total 68; median dose 180mg (126-220). 1 pt received 4 cycles plus three upon progression 4 years later. Acute procedurerelated G3-4 labs were transaminitis (22% cycles), thrombocytopenia (21%), anemia (16%) and hyperbilirubinemia (9% cycles). One patient experienced tumor lysis, 1 carcinoid crisis and 1 CNS hemorrhage. Later grade 3-4 AEs were mainly hematological: neutropenia (47% cycles), thrombocytopenia (29%) and anemia (15%). The 1 treatment-related death was due to cholangitis (day 74). Response was 79% in 19 evaluable patients (2 CR, 13 PR) . Median hepatic PFS was 39 months (n=20). Conclusion: CS:PHP with melphalan has efficacy in patients with MNET liver metastases too extensive for other strategies. Response is long-lasting, with 39-month PFS and possibility of re-treatment upon progression. This promising novel therapy offers interventional radiologists a new tool and a central role in patient management.

This study provides results about treating aortic necks as small as 7mm and the ability to treat AAA patients with narrow (starting from 4.7mm) and tortuous vessels. Material and Methods: The Ovation stent graft has a unique deployment system of 2 polymer-filled proximal sealing rings that accommodate short proximal aortic neck length of >7 mm, and a hydrophilic coated 14F OD delivery system that accommodates access vessels >4.7 mm. This prospective multicenter trial evaluated the performance of the Ovation stent graft in 150 patients with AAA at 27 centers globally. Data were available for 123 patients through 1 month, 52 patients through 6 month and 8 patients through 1 yr follow-up. This study patient follow-up will continue through 5 years. Results: As of March 22nd 2011, 123 patients (male: 87%, mean age: 74, mean AAA diameter: 58.8 mm) underwent EVAR with the Ovation stent graft; technical success was achieved in 100%.

Segmental arteries of RHA were identified based on segmental liver enhancement when the CT images were overlaid on the 3D reconstructed model of RHA branches. Each segmental branch was evaluated regarding its calibre at origin (CO), detectable length (L), angle of origin (AO) from its main stem. Results: In all 20 patients the anterior segmental artery was the direct continuation of the RHA and it gave origin to the arteries of segments 5 and 8. The mean calibre of artery to segment 5 (A5) at origin was 1.8 + 0.7 mm , its length was 6.2 + 2.01 cm , angle at origin 90,7 + 44,3 while artery to segment 8 (A8) showed 4.7 + 104 mm, 4.8 + 1.7 cm & 0 angle.

Thereby, a special focus was given on the impact of the sequence of the two different procedural steps (super-micro-bland particle embolization and RF-ablation). Material and Methods: In ten pigs, super-micro-bland particle embolization combined with RF-ablation was carried out. Supermicro-bland embolization was performed with spherical particles of a very small size and a tight calibration (40\u00c2\u00b110\u00c2\u03bcm). In the left kidneys, RF-ablations were performed before embolization (I). In the right kidneys, RF-ablations were performed after embolization (II). Angiographic (e.g. vessel architecture), macroscopic (e.g. long and short axes of the RF-ablations) and microscopic (e.g. particle distribution) study goals were defined. Results: Angiography detected almost no vessels in the center of the RF-ablations in I. In II, angiography could not define the RF-ablations. Macroscopy detected significantly larger long and short axes of the RF-ablations in II compared to I (52.2/3.2mm vs. 45.3/6.9mm [P0.05] and 25.1/3.5mm vs. 20.0/1.9mm [P0.01], respectively). Microscopy detected irregular particle distribution at the rim of the RF-ablations in I. In II, microscopy detected homogeneous particle distribution at the rim of the RF-ablations.

Short-term predictors of mortality in the malignant obstructive jaundice are increased proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses and the presence of renal dysfunction.",

The inclusion criteria were patient with bone metastasis without chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks and pain score >4. After MR-HIFU, Safety, improvement in pain score (10point visual analogue scale), and changes in pain medication are valuated during 60 days. Results: At this time 1 patient was included and is still under followup. No major complication or unintended lesions were observed during, or after the procedure. Only minor complications (pain during sonications) occurred during treatment. Minor complication after procedure included moderate musculoskeletal pain. This seems to be related to patient position during treatment. The pain score decreased at day 14 post-procedure from an average of 3-4 (with a maximum of 6) before treatment to an average of 2-3 (with a maximum of 5) without modification of pain drug.

In our institute, we use for selected indication radiofrequency facet joint denervation (RFD) for two years. This paper presents our first experiences of RFD compared to facet joint intraarticular steroid injections. Material and Methods: For image guidance we used a 4-slice CT scanner (Siemens Volume Zoom) with collimation 4x1mm slices. After written consent, the patient was positioned prone on the table for CT-guided needle placement. Before ablation (thermocoagulation) of the medial branch of the dorsal branch Nervi spinalis stimulation of the sensitive and motoric fibers was performed to assure the correct needle position. Ablation time was usually 60 sec. per branch with a temperature of 80\u00b0 C. Results: 60 RFD procedures were performed in 48 patients. The procedure takes 30 minutes including patient positioning. 70% of patients reported a 50% or greater relieve in back pain, benefit in mobility, reduction of analgesic consumption and prolongation of therapeutic effects. The duration of the effect reached from 3 up to 10 months. Conclusion: Facet joint denervation is a good alternative to standard treatment in lumbar facet joint syndrome as it reduces repetitive steroid injections. ",

Casula; Vascular and Interventional Radiology Department, Hospital Dr. Peset, Valencia, Spain. Purpose: The incidence of compression vertebral fracture has increased in the last years. This is due to the high prevalence of osteoporosis and tumoral diseases affecting vertebral bodies. There are situations of greater vertebral weakness, as in case of osteonecrosis or plasmacytoma. In these cases, medical management cannot prevent evolution to collapse, and is often unable to relieve patient's pain. Besides, vertebroplasty in this patients could theoretically present complications as cement migration. We propose the use of vesselplasty in this context, in order to reduce potential cement leak risk, allow patients to improve in a shorter period of time, and reincorporate to normal activity. Material and Methods: We recruited 5 patients (3 with osteonecrosis and 2 with plasmacytoma) out of the 200 patients treated with vesselplasty in our institution. Vertebrography followed by vesselplasty was performed using the Vessel-X Bone Filling Container System according to the standardized procedure. Three outcome variables were evaluated: pain, mobility analgesic drugs use, all of them were characterized using numerical scales. Results: All patients presented significant improvement in the three outcome variables. No clinical complications were found. Conclusion: Vesselplasty is a promising technique to improve pain, increase mobility, and reduce the need for analgesia in patients with pathologic vertebral fractures due to osteonecrosis or plasmacytoma; its use could reduce potential cement migrations (further studies comparing with vertebroplasty are needed).",

Pre-op AP and lateral x-rays of the lumbar spine should be performed, as well at 48h and 1 year after the intervention in order to: evaluate correct positioning of the device, measure L1-S1 angle evolution and disc height evolution at the treated level(s), exclude adverse events such as slipping or bending/fracture of device wings, spinous process fracture, morphological changes of spinous processes (subsidence Learning objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine if a difference exists in balloon lift force, balloon contact area and balloon exerted stress between a unilateral and bilateral approach to balloon kyphoplasty. Background: Balloon kyphoplasty is a therapeutic intervention for treating and reducing vertebral compression fractures from osteoporosis and metastatic disease. This investigation involved assessing two procedural approaches currently in clinical use, unilateral and bilateral, which involve the use of inflatable bone tamps (IBT). Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Biomechanical performance of these two approaches was assessed in-vitro. Ten sets of 15/3 Kyphon Xpander TM IBTs were inserted into a benchtop constrained polyurethane foam environment (simulated vertebral body) mimicking clinical methods. Either one IBT (unilateral) or two IBTs (bilateral) were introduced into the model and inflated to rated maximum inflation volume at a prescribed rate. Lift force exerted by the IBT(s) and the inflated contact area were measured at specific volume increments while exerted stress was calculated. At the IBT's maximum inflation volume of 4.0cc, lift force of the bilateral approach was 105% greater than that of unilateral approach, and contact area was 279% larger than that of unilateral approach. The exerted stress of bilateral approach was 26% less than that of unilateral approach (77.97psi vs. 105.00psi).",

Background: Primary and hypervascular metastatic skeletal tumors provide a therapeutic dilemma. Complete surgical resection is often complex due to awkward tumor location, involvement of adjacent vasculature and associated neoplastic hypervascularity. These factors serve to potentiate the perioperative risk of significant and uncontrollable bleeding, with prolonged operative times also problematic.

Background: Interventional MR imaging provides an ideal imaging modality to comply with the ALARA practice mandate. This is of particular interest in the pediatric patient population as well as in young adults, but for interventionalists and their staff who are exposed to radiation while performing procedures on a daily basis. In addition to unique features of interventional MRI for musculoskeletal procedures, recent developments in MRI scanner design have expanded the spectrum and possibilities of MR-guided musculoskeletal procedures in children and adults considerably. Learning objectives: 1. To know the intrinsic biomechanical properties of PMMA and research thrusts of new cements. 2. To have general notions of biomechanics of the skeleton and to know the areas subject to compressive forces. 3. To know the criteria for determining biomechanic success of cement filling in cementoplasty and its involvement in reducing bone pain. Background: Vertebroplasty in osteoporotic indication allows bone healing to prevent vertebral collapse. PMMA cement has high resistance to compressive forces and poor resistance to twisting forces. Bearing areas and joint surfaces are mainly subject to compressive forces. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Good indications for mechanical consolidation in cementoplasty are vertebrae, sacrum, acetabulum, condyle, scapular glenoid, humeral head. The intersection zones of the bone trabeculae are more constrained and should be targets for consolidation if the bone is pathological. Consolidation is not the only mechanism involved in the reduction of pain as sternum, ilium, scapula could effectively benefit from vertebroplasty in some articles. However, treatment with thermal ablation should be at least as effective in these indications purely analgesics. Vertebroplasty in the diaphyses of long bones is not an indication of mechanical consolidation and if the palliative indication is maintained secondary fracture risk should be explained to the patient. Evolution should be percutaneous screwing in weakened bone combined with cementoplasty to provide a consolidation. Conclusion: The biomechanical properties of cement and the skeleton can target indications of cementoplasty for which the mechanical consolidation is possible.

Kang 1 , 1 Interventional Radiologist, Wooridul Spine Hospital, Busan, Korea, 2 Neurosergery, Wooridul Spine Hospital, Seoul, Korea, 3 Clinical Research Division, Wooridul Spine Hospital, Busan, Korea. Learning objectives: To report general information and interventional therapies using CT fluoroscopy on herniated thoracic disc. Background: Thoracic disc herniation is rare, but current studies using MRI reported prevalence rates of over 10%. In the clinical fields, the accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment continues to pose a considerable challenge because of various nonspecific symptoms. Even though a symptomatic herniated thoracic disc was found, adequate treatments are still a problem because the thoracic spine has unique anatomical and biomechanical properties so that access to the thoracic disc under fluoroscopy guidance may not be easy. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The symptoms of thoracic disc herniation are pain, numbness and weakness in the lower limbs and paresthesia. Back pain could be divided into two types as interscapular back pain and lower thoracic back pain depending on the level of herniated disc. Pain without tenderness is main symptom in most patients, while intercostal radiating pain is much less than thought. Discography has been used to evaluate symptomatic thoracic disc herniation. But in my experience, CT-guided diagnostic nerve root block (NRB) is much more useful as a diagnostic and therapeutic method. If the patient doesn't get better or worse after 2 to 3 times of NRBs, percutaneous laser decompression can be considered. Under the CT guidance, percutaneous thoracic disc decompression (PTDD) using laser is a more minimally invasive spine surgery with fewer incisions, shorter operation times. Indication of CT-guided PTDD is soft disc herniation. Conclusion: Accurate diagnosis and appropriate interventional treatment using CT fluoroscopy provide good results to manage symptomatic thoracic disc herniation.",

Background: Patient selection and choice of the most appropriate ablation treatment was made based on lesion characteristics. Different technologies were applied like radiofrequency, plasmamediated radiofrequency, microwave and possible association with cementoplasty. Before undergoing ablation treatment, patients were evaluated by means of a validated visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment and by recording any use of analgesics. The site corresponding to the lesion was detected by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For benign bone lesion (osteoid osteoma), ablation was performed with curative intent; for malignant bone lesions, ablation has a palliative role for pain control; in the cases of soft tissue tumours curative role can be considered in benign lesions and cytoreductive intent is considered for malignant tumours.

Conclusion: Percutaneous ablation therapies represent a safe and valuable alternative for treating bone and soft tissue tumours, providing rapid relief of symptoms and improving the quality of life of patients. In case of cytoreductive intent ablations can work synergistically with chemotherapy.",

To precise the advantages and drawbacks of VBS. Background: Percutaneous vertebral augmentation techniques include: vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty and, more recently, vertebral body stenting. Though vertebroplasty is a good consolidation technique, it usually does not restore vertebral height. Kyphoplasty can achieve vertebral height restoration; however, after balloon deflation this restoration is not always maintained. VBS is a minimal invasive percutaneous technique, similar to kyphoplasty, using two metallic stents allowing preservation of the vertebral augmentation until the cement injection. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Current indication for VBS is height restoration in fresh vertebral compression fractures (type A1, Magerl classification). The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia. Flat-panel CT, or combined CT-fluoroscopic guidance is mandatory for precise positioning of the stent. After 3D control of the proper positioning of the stents in the fractured vertebral body, the balloons are gently insufflated until the stents are completely deployed. Finally, cement is injected under fluoroscopic control to consolidate the fracture. Conclusion: Vertebral body stenting is a promising technique, ensuring an excellent vertebral body augmentation without height loss between balloon deflation and cement injection. In non-osteoporotic patients, the vertebral height restoration is optimal, given that the VBS is performed during the first seven days after the trauma.",

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the level of understanding in the use of local anaesthesia and conscious sedation by radiologists in practice. Material and Methods: An online survey was sent to consultant and trainee radiologists via the Faculty of Radiologists, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Results: 59 questionnaires were completed (28 consultant, 20 postfellowship trainees, 11 trainees) . 81% (n = 48) use local anaesthesia or conscious sedation more that 3 times a month. 47% of responders (n=28) hold a valid ACLS or BLS certificate. A minority of responders knew the duration of action for commonly used agents (15% correct for 1% Lignocaine, 57% for Fentanyl, 32% for Midazolam). Similar results were seen for knowledge on duration of onset (25% correct for 1% Lignocaine, 15% for Fentanyl, 28% for Midazolam). Whilst the majority of responders knew the names of reversal agents (96% correct for Midazolam, 92% for Fentanyl) only 56% and 53% knew the dose for flumazenil and naloxone, respectively. Conclusion: Whilst the majority of respondents were aware of important issues such as the names of reversal agents; there was a significant lack of knowledge regarding duration of onset, duration of action and doses of reversal agents.

A specific regard is given to the description of the insertion procedure step-by-step. Background: During the last decade, technical improvement in peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) allows a significant increase of using these catheters in various clinical indications, particularly in Europe. More than 1500 PICCs were implanted between 2005 and 2010 in our department. The radiologist should play a major role in PICC insertion and management. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The main indications are extended antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, nutrition, administration of blood or poor venous access. PICC insertion is a sterile procedure using US guidance for a peripheral vein puncture in the upper arm. Fluoroscopy confirms the correct placement of the tip of the PICC, which is usually in the distal superior vena cava. Common complications are infection such as phlebitis, thrombosis of the vein, catheter malposition or breakage. Product advancement in PICCs includes multiple lumens for multiple access, PICCs for neonatal use, cardiac monitoring of central venous pressures as well as new advances for placement (use of electromagnetic visualization). Conclusion: New areas of development improve actual products and techniques and since PICC promotes patient comfort and outpatient treatment their placement should be a significant activity in interventional radiology. Fistulogram revealed collaterization of ulnar artery flow across the palmar arch and occluded radial artery in 3 patients with radiocephalic fistula. Balloon dilation of the stenosis between cephalic vein and reconstituted radial artery was successfully performed in all 3 patients.",

Patel 1 Successful embolisation of a dialysis brachio-cephalic fistula for significant steal in a patient with severe contrast allergy performed solely under ultrasound control. Purpose: To explore whether pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) may be the source of angina-like symptoms in HHT patients without known coronary artery disease. In theory, a paradoxical embolus to a coronary artery could cause myocardial ischemia or infarction; this phenomenon has been described in other right-to-left shunts. Material and Methods: Patients with confirmed or probable HHT and PAVMs followed at a large HHT center were contacted by telephone; verbal consent was obtained. Patients were asked about chest pain symptoms before and after PAVM embolization, post-procedure hospitalizations, myocardial infarctions (MI) and/or coronary artery disease (CAD) and history of cardiac catheterization. CAD risk factors, including family history, high cholesterol and/or blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking were determined. 84 patients with at least one treated PAVM and 14 patients with HHT and tiny untreated PAVM were included, mean age 45 (range, . Results: No patient declined participation. 6/98 patients had experienced typical angina-like chest pain. 3 of these had had a myocardial infarction prior to PAVM embolotherapy; 5 had had cardiac catheterization. Of these, 4 had normal cardiac catheterizations, and 1 had single vessel occlusion with otherwise normal coronary arteries. 1 patient had a normal EKG at the time of her chest pain; she did not experience an MI and did not undergo cardiac catheterization. 1 patient with atypical symptoms had a negative cardiac catheterization. Conclusion: Our results suggest that angina and/or myocardial infarction can be a symptom of paradoxical emboli in patients with PAVMs: 3% (3/98) of our patients had completed MI with normal coronary arteries; an additional 3% have highly suggestive histories. We believe cardiac events should be added to the list of symptoms of paradoxical emboli potentially associated with PAVMs. Purpose: Typical management of venous malformations (VMs) of the hand and forearm includes either embolization/sclerosis or resection. Ethanol-based sclerosis can lead to nerve deficits, strictures, and contractures. Surgical resection can minimize these complications, but lesion localization and decompression make resection challenging. We present the use of pre-operative percutaneous epoxy embolization prior to surgical resection to minimize these challenges.",

Results: Hemodynamically stabilization was obtained in all cases. Twenty-four patients (77.4%) survived to discharges. The bleeding vessels were identified in 30 patients (90.9%) by angiography; the obturator arteries were mostly injured in 26 sites of 20 patients (60.6%). The obturator arteries arised from the EIA were found in three sites of two patients. Extravasations were observed in the branches of the EIA: deep circumflex iliac artery (3 sites/3 patients); medial femoral circumflex artery (5 sites/4 patients) and others. Eleven branches of the EIA were embolized in 10 patients (30.3%). The significant correlation was only shown between the procedure time and mortality in the survival analyses (p=0.03). Conclusion: TAE was an effective therapeutic approach for pelvic fractures with the arterial injuries. The obturator artery was often injured, and the contributions of the external iliac artery branches were found in one-third patients.

Material and Methods: Between June 2001 and June 2010, all consecutive patients who underwent embolization for AcSTB in our department were included. All patients were treated by oral anticoagulation (n = 13), or heparin (n = 22). Patient features were as follows (n=35): mean age 74 y.o; women/men =65/35%; mean initial hemoglobin/prothrombin time =8 g/dl / 46%. CT scans was performed before embolization in all patients in order to confirm the diagnosis, appreciate the topography of the hematoma and search for active bleeding. Global angiography was followed by super selective catheterization of the bleeding artery and subsequent embolization was performed. In case of normal angiogram, the arteries feeding the anatomic compartment of the hematoma were empirically embolized. Clinical success was assessed as one month survival. Results: In all patients but 7, angiography demonstrated active bleeding (n=24), pseudo-aneurysm (n=2), hypervascular blush (n=2). Embolization material used was: gelfoam (n=26), coils (n=7), calibrated microparticles (n=4), covered stent graft (n=2). Embolized arteries were: lumbar (n=15), inferior epigastric (n=10), deep circumflex iliac (n=7), ilio-lumbar (n=5), superficial femoral (n=1), deep femoral (n=1), iliac (n=1), lateral thoracic (n=1). One-month survival was 68.6% (24/35) , comprising 4 cases of early re-embolisation. Half of the death were related to uncontrollable bleeding. Mean IGSII score was higher in patient who ultimately died (74.3 versus 31.4 ; p = 0.004 ). Conclusion: AcSTB can be efficiently treated by embolisation, however rebleeding is not uncommon. ",

Purpose: To present the endovascular experience in percutaneous treatment of visceral aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms in a period of thirteen years from 1997 to 2010. Material and Methods: In all 40 patients were treated: they were divided into 18 aneurysms and 23 pseudoaneurysms (27 males and 13 females, mean age: 58 years) 26 vascular lesions underwent percutaneous treatment in emergency and 15 lesions occurred in occasional radiological diagnosis. In 27 aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms were used coils: 6 cases (4 used Guglielmi Detachable Coil) had profit by direct embolization of the sac and 21 cases had embolization on either side of the lesion with 'sandwich technique' to prevent retrograde filling. In 14 aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms were used stents: 1 self-expanding stent, 3 self-expanding stents in association with coils, 9 stentgrafts, 1 stentgraft with coils embolization. A radiological follow up was performed using angio-CT at 12-48 months. Results: Technical success was achieved in 37 patients (16 aneurysms and 22 pseudoaneurysms) , in 4 cases an incomplete exclusion of the sac was just obtained. In emergency regimen the exclusion of the aneurysm was obtained with an immediate stop of bleeding. In 1 case splenectomy was necessary for subsequent splenic ischaemia, in 2 cases splenic micro infarctions solved spontaneously with a 'restitutio ad integrum'.",

Material and Methods: From March 2009 to December 2010, 126 male pelvic sides were studied by angio-CT and selective arterial angiography. Definition 1 of aPAs was any artery located within the periprostatic region running parallel to the dorsal vascular complex. Definition 2 considered only those aPAs that terminate as the dorsal artery of the penis. Results: Using definition 1 the prevalence of aPAs was 21.4% (n=27), while it was 3.2% (n=4) using definition 2. aPAs could be sub classified as lateral in 77.8% (n=21), coursing along the lateral aspect of the prostate and apical in 22.2% (n=6), emerging near the prostatic apex. All aPAs in definition 2 were lateral. When definition 1 is used, the dorsal artery of the penis usually arises from the internal pudendal artery, and the lateral aPAs appear as an anastomotic arch, allowing careful embolization. When definition 2 is used, the internal pudendal artery has a proximal termination, with the dorsal artery of the penis arising from the aPAs. In these cases, the prostatic branches must be selectively embolized to maintain the patency of the aPAs.",

Outcomes including hemostasis, recurrent bleeding and complications were evaluated. Results: Successful embolization was achieved in all cases. Bleeding was stopped and immediate hemodynamic stabilization was exhibited in all cases after embolization. Although one patient with ruptured pseudoaneurysm died within 30 days because of multi-organ failure, rebleeding was observed in none of the patients. There was no major complication in all cases; neither end-organ damage nor organ ischemia related to the procedure was observed except for two cases of asymptomatic gastric ulcer formation.

Material and Methods: 32 patients with signs and symptoms of non variceal upper gastrointestinal bleed were followed up retrospectively and prospectively. Clinical data for each patient was recorded from medical records. Angioembolization was done using coils and gelfoam. Post procedure follow-up was done and the effect of various parameters like coagulopathy, sepsis and multiorgan failure on the outcome of angioembolization was studied. Results: Angioembolization is the management of choice in endoscopically unmanageable non variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 32 patients were examined during a period extending from 2007 to 2010. 71.8% of patients presented with either hematemesis or malena. Embolization was done using sandwich technique. Coagulopathy (seen in 47% of patients), had a significant effect on survival (p=.015). Post procedure complications were divided into rebleed, technical problems and ischemia. Rebleed was seen in 3 patients, technical problems in 1 patient, ischemia in 2 patients in form of splenic ischemia and dissection of celiac artery in 1 patient. Clinical success was seen in 30 patients (n=30) (93.7%). Conclusion: Transcatheter embolisation is a safe and effective procedure and involves no risk of ischaemic complications. Angiographic embolization is a viable option in poor candidates for surgery. It has the potential to reduce mortality in acute non variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding provided we continue our efforts to optimize the occlusive technique and enhance the hemostatic effects.",

Fourteen presented portal hypertension due to intrahepatic block (group 1) were treated by parenchymal embolization. Four presented segmental portal hypertension (group 2) were treated by proximal splenic artery embolization. Clinical evolution, platelet count and CT scan were retrospectively analysed. Results were compared in regard to extension of parenchymal exclusion. Results: Overall success rate was 95%. In the group 1, mean volume of infarcted spleen was 63%. Increase in the mean platelet count at the 6-month follow-up was 232%. It was measured above 80 000/ml in 12 patients at the 1-week follow-up, 13 patients at 1 month and 10 at 6 months. All patients with less than 80 000/ml platelets at 6 months presented less than 50% of infarcted spleen volume. In the second group, mean infarcted volume was 63%. External bleeding episodes stopped and platelet counts above 80000/ml were noted in all patients. Six patients presented subsequent complications: 2 were minor and 4 were major (2 splenic abscesses, 1 respiratory failure associated with ascites and transient ascites with portal vein thrombosis). Infarcted splenic volume in these 6 patients was always equal to or greater than 70%.

We also achieved high embolization efficacy in patients with coagulopathy. No rebleeding, intestinal ischemia, or necrosis was observed after embolization. Conclusion: Embolization with 0.010-inch detachable microcoils allows for the use of a 1.7-F microcatheter and thus, the catheterization of the long branch alone of the vasa recta. This increases embolization success rates and decreases complication rates. Our findings suggest that 0.010-inch detachable coils are useful for embolization to treat cases of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage.",

Although the treatment method for symptomatic giant hemangiomas is surgery, the classical paradigm of operative resection remains. The aim of this study is to evaluate the symptomatic improvement and size reduction effect of embolization with bleomycin mixed lipiodol for the treatment of symptomatic giant hepatic hemangiomas. Material and Methods: Twelve patients (3 males and 9 females, mean age of 49\u00b16,9) with symptomatic giant hemangiomas (>4 cm) unfit for surgery were treated with selective embolization by bleomycin (15 mg) mixed with lipiodol (10 ml). Same principles were utilized with TACE. They were followed up (3-24 months) clinically and by imaging methods every 3 months. The statistical analysis was made by SPSS 16.0 and P values under 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. Results: Embolization was performed for 18 lesions in 12 patients. The median volume of the hemangiomas was 210,028cm 3 (min 9,27 max 9020) before the intervention and it became 86,814 cm 3 (min 0,9 max 5030 cm 3 ) thereafter. There were no mortality and morbidity related to the treatment. The procedure was repeated in only one patient. Symptomatic improvement was observed in all patients and significant volume reduction was achieved (p=0.001). Conclusion: Clinical observation is preferred and operative management is denied in most of the patients with giant liver hemangiomas as both methods have similar complication rates. Minimally invasive embolization offers an alternative and effective treatment of giant symptomatic hemangiomas of the liver.",

Material and Methods: Five liver transplant patients had proximal splenic artery embolization performed with an AVP to treat splenic artery steal syndrome. Diagnosis was suspected by elevated liver enzymes and Doppler ultrasound. It was confirmed by celiac trunk angiogram. Devices ranging from 12 to 14 cm were placed through 6-F guiding catheters. All of them were plug I except one that it was a plug type II. Desired AVP location was distal to the dorsal pancreatic artery and proximal to the most peripheral pancreatica magna branch. Laboratory liver function tests and US follow-up were performed in all patients. Results: Splenic artery embolization was successful in all cases, with device repositioning required in two. Occlusion took an average of approximately 5 minutes. Additional embolization material was not necessary. A second AVP was necessary placed in one patient. There were no complications of the procedures. Clinical improvement and normalization of US parameters was seen completely in 4 patients at 24 hours. In one patient there was an irreversible ischemic area in right hepatic lobe at 7-day post-transplantation US. Conclusion: Splenic artery steal syndrome following liver transplantation can be treated by splenic artery embolization with Amplatzer vascular plug safety. It is a minimally invasive procedure which leads to immediate clinical improvement.",

These techniques, often used in concert, leave the nidus maximally ''vulnerable'' to the effects of the chosen agent with minimization of complications. 3) Embolic agents employed in AVM treatment are divided into liquid agents (such as ethanol, cyanoacrylates and Onyx) that occlude at the level of the arterioles or capillary bed, and mechanical devices (coils, Amplatzer Vascular Plug) that are equivalent to surgical ligations and occlude medium-sized to small arteries.

To describe our experience in the management of this pathology discussing current endovascular treatment options. Background: Venous malformations are the most common peripheral vascular malformations. Despite their typical location in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, they can also involve underlying tissues. Clinical evaluation often underestimates the involvement of deep structures. Multiple imaging modalities must be used to evaluate characteristics of the lesion such as size, flow, relation to the surrounding structures and lesion content in order to establish a differential diagnosis. The patient's age and the lesion's size, location and complications that may range from cosmetic deformity to life threatening conditions determine a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach. Several sclerosing agents can be used depending on the characteristics of the lesion. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: We reviewed the clinical and radiological features of the venous malformations and analyzed the utility and advantages of different imaging techniques, focussing on the identification of some relevant characteristics that will determine their prognosis and will condition the therapeutic approach. Some educational cases are shown to illustrate all the aforementioned. Conclusion: Diagnosis of venous malformations is usually based on medical history and physical examination, but imaging techniques are essential to confirm the diagnosis and to plan the appropriate treatment. The more useful techniques are MRI and ultrasound. The role of the interventional radiology as a part of an interdisciplinary group is relevant to treat these anomalies. Pre-operative embolisation is often a complex procedure due to their rich arterial supply. Supraselective embolisation in tandem with CT angiography results in excellent devascularisation of these lesions. The vast majority of hepatic haemangiomas are small, asymptomatic, incidental findings that require no treatment. A small percentage of patients have symptoms of pain and pressure which may be directly attributable to a large haemangioma. These cases require careful clinical and radiological evaluation to ensure that symptoms do relate to the haemangioma. The treatment is usually surgical, but embolisation plays a key role in preoperative devascularisation. CT angiography plays a vital role in planning surgery and embolisation, with lesions often having a dual arterial supply. Embolisation is predominantly performed with particulate material. In our institution, a variety of giant haemangiomas have been treated in this format. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Following CT angiography, supraselective catherisation of the vessels was performed to ensure all feeding and aberrant vessels were evaluated. Embosphere embolisation was then performed with post-procedural angiography and CT angiography to evaluate for adequate devascularisation. Surgical resection was evaluated histologically with a particular emphasis on the level of microinfarction achieved. Conclusion: Symptomatic giant haemangiomas are a rare entity. Pre-operative embolisation is often a complex procedure due to their rich arterial supply. Supraselective embolisation in tandem with CT angiography results in excellent devascularisation of these lesions.",

Background: Soft tissue bleedings are more and more frequently involved in hemodynamic collapse in patients treated by oral/parenteral anticoagulation. The availability of better suited embolization material and microcatheter as well as the more wide spread use of triphasic CT has increased the role of IR in this disease. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The two more frequent localizations of AcSTB are ilio-psoas muscle and anterior rectus sheath. Multiphasic CT scan is able to confirm the diagnosis, appreciate the topography of the hematoma and search for active bleeding. All hemodynamically unstable patient, or with active bleeding on CT should undergo embolization. A global angiogram seems still necessary in all cases and all potential target arteries of the bleeding site should be selectively opacified as follows. For ilio-psoas hematomas, the target arteries are the lumbar, the ilio-lumbar and deep circumflex iliac. Concerning anterior rectus sheath hematomas, the targets are the inferiors epigastrics and deep circumflex iliac. All bleeding sites (active extravasation, arterio-venous fistula, pseudo aneurysm, abrupt cut off artery, etc.) should be occluded preferably by definitive material. Like in upper GI bleeding, empiric embolization is efficient. This poster will review the major clinical anatomical and technical basis that IRs should know in order to achieve good clinical result in this highly fatal condition Conclusion: AcSTB can be efficiently treated by embolization, all IR should promote and perform this life saving intervention.",

Material and Methods: During the period 1999-2009, 60 patients were treated with TEVAR for acute complicated type B aortic dissection at Uppsala University Hospital. Early (1-3 months) and late (>5 years) post-operative evaluation of aortic morphology with special emphasis on false lumen thrombosis and changes in aortic diameter was done with computed tomography. Changes in aortic morphology were compared to clinical outcome. Results: Three-year survival was 90% and five-year survival was 87%. Freedom from re-intervention at five years was 65%. Data concerning the change of aortic morphology is being analyzed at present time and the results will be ready for presentation at the time for CIRSE 2011. Conclusion: Patients with acute complicated type B aortic dissection can be treated with stent grafts with excellent survival compared to previously published results. The analysis of aortic remodeling after stent-graft implantation will hopefully elucidate the findings in the clinical outcome. During a median follow-up of 37 months (range 1-84), two type II endoleaks had been encountered, there was no need for reinterventions and there were no aneurysm-related deaths. One patient died 8 years after endovascular repair from unrelated causes. Follow-up imaging documented a reduction in aneurysm diameter of a median of 9.1 mm (range 0-18). All 4 patients with pre-procedural periaortic fibrosis and hydronephrosis improved after endovascular repair. All these patients received adjuvant medical treatment. Conclusion: Endovascular repair appears to be a safe and effective option for IAAAs. Aneurysm exclusion, particularly when combined with additional medical therapy, seems to be associated with reduction of aneurysm size and regression or stabilization of the inflammatory process. ",

Data collected include patient demographics, relevant medical history, risk scores, morphological data, device components used, repositioning data and procedural outcomes. The patients will be followed for 10 years to characterize the long-term viability of the Gore Excluder Device. Results: At the time of submission over 60 patients have been treated at these twelve sites. Data collection is ongoing and we expect to be able to present a significantly larger experience at the meeting. Documentation of this early experience should provide an accurate assessment of this novel delivery system. Conclusion: We will briefly present the elements of the new delivery system, our direct clinical experience at Liverpool, and a summary of the European registry experience with the Gore C3 Delivery System.

            "text": "Exclusion of thoracic aortic aneurysm using a recapturable/ repositionable Amplatzer thoracic graft: preclinical evaluation in a large swine model X. Gu Purpose: The Amplatzer thoracic graft (ATG) features low-profile delivery, repositionability, recapturability and integration into the aortic wall. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the exclusion of aneurysms in a swine model with ATG. Material and Methods: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) were surgically created in 18 swines (58.2-87.6 kg) using a fusiform Dacron graft. ATG is a self-expanding tubular prosthesis consisting of two nitinol and two polyester layers of braid. The graft was mounted into a delivery catheter with a lock mechanism allowing full recapture and reposition of the graft during implant. The graft was deployed via 12 F sheath. Animals were followed up at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months, and afterwards euthanized for pathology examination. Results: Graft implantation was technically successful in all 18 cases. Recapture and reposition of the graft were tried at ten implants without any issues. Aneurysm exclusion rates were 83.3% after implant, 94.4% at 1 week, and 100% at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. All implanted grafts remained stable in the implanted position throughout the course of the study. Pathology demonstrated generally optimal healing of the grafted aorta and aneurysm characterized by inclusion of the graft in organized, maturing and stable neointima. All the aneurysms were filled by organized thrombus. Conclusion: Endovascular exclusion of TAA was achieved using a novel metal/fabric hybrid graft in an animal model. The ATG offers the advantages of low-profile introduction, reposition/recaptureability and incorporation into aortic wall with neointimal coverage of the graft surface for aneurysm exclusion. In 2007-2008, 56 EVAR procedures were performed with a secondary intervention rate of 3.8% at two years. Conclusion: Recent fall in the rates of secondary intervention and changes in the severity of complications are likely to reflect technological improvements in stent-grafts, increased operator experience, and changing management of complications. The need for secondary interventions is a significant problem for EVAR. Cost effectiveness studies often use the EVAR 1 trial intervention rate of 20%. A lower rate will have implications on decision making for individual patients, and general service provision.",

Barrufet Learning objectives: Endovascular treatment of aortic aneurysms with infra-renal neck length <10mm is associated with a high risk of type 1 endoleaks. Such patients are therefore usually offered open repair, despite its higher mortality. We present our experience with the chimney technique -a technique for renal and visceral revascularization allowing complete endovascular treatment of juxta/suprarenal aneurysms, using off-the-shelf devices. We used this technique in high-risk patients in whom either anatomy or urgency prevented the use of a custom-made fenestrated device. Background: Between November 2008 and February 2011, 14 patients fulfilled the above criteria and were treated using the chimney technique as 'compassionate' cases. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Immediate intra-operative technical success was achieved in all cases. There were 2 in-hospital deaths. During a mean 9-month follow-up (range 1-24), one patient developed a type 1 endoleak through the gutter between the chimney stent-graft and the main stent-graft. This was successfully treated using coil embolisation. The remaining 11 patients have no type 1 endoleaks and all their target vessels remain patent at their last follow-up.",

Because of this, a safer thrombolytic agent is desirable. \u0394(K2-K5)Plasmin (TAL6003) is a novel thrombolytic that is a recombinant form of naturally occurring plasmin where kringle 1 is spliced directly to the serine protease domain preserving both fibrin-and \u03b12-antiplasmin binding functions. Material and Methods: Efficacy of TAL6003 to lyse clots from a segmental artery. 5 animals were euthanized following surgery (3 x open and 2 x laparoscopic resection) , 10 (open resection) after 6 weeks of survival. Blood specimen was obtained throughout, a repeat angiogram and a complete necropsy at six weeks. Results: Selective renal ischemia was achieved in all cases. Surgical resection time averaged 11 minutes (range 10-13) and 23.3 (range 9-40) in the open and laparoscopic groups, respectively. Estimated blood loss was negligible with the exception of one case where an accessory renal artery was originally overlooked. Reversal of the polymer to liquid state was consistent angiographically and visually in all cases. Time to complete flow return averaged 7 and 2.5 minutes for Lumagel\u2122 and arterial clamping, respectively. Angiographic analysis at six weeks did not demonstrate any evidence of vascular injury. Laboratory data and necropsies showed no differences between animals undergoing vascular clamping or polymer injection. Conclusion: Lumagel\u2122 was as effective as vascular clamping in producing a bloodless operative field for partial nephrectomy while maintaining flow to the uninvolved portion of the affected kidney. Purpose: To evaluate error in needle tip location when using fluoroscopic guidance combined with trajectory overlay from C-arm CT. Material and Methods: C-arm CT images of anthropomorphic phantom (Model 057, CIRS) were acquired with a flat panel detector (Innova 4100 GE Healthcare). 5 trajectories were defined using a software dedicated to needle guidance. Each trajectory corresponds to a different target point inside the phantom. Then trajectories were overlaid in real time on top of fluoroscopic images. Two experienced interventional radiologists, inserted needles according to the predefined trajectories. The \"lesions\" defined as target points were not visible under fluoroscopy, to ensure that the needle guidance relied exclusively on the trajectory that was overlaid on top of fluoroscopy. After each needle insertion of the needle, a C-arm CT image was acquired with the needle in place. Error was defined as 3D distance between the target and the real needle location. Results: All punctures were achieved in less than 1 minute and during the first attempt. The error in needle tip location was 1.4\u00b1O.7 mm (mean \u00b1DS) overall. It was not different for the two operators with errors of 1.2\u00b10.6 mm and 1.5\u00b10.9 mm, respectively. In all the measurements performed, the minimal and maximum errors were 0.4 mm and 3.2 mm, respectively. Evaluation of the accuracy in clinical experience with fluoroscopic guidance combined with trajectory overlay from C-arm CT for puncture of bone lesions during cementoplasty or thermal ablation will be presented. Conclusion: Accuracy of needle placement using needle guidance software on 3D C-arm CT is high. Disclosure: Mr Yves Trousset is a GE Healthcare employee Munich 2011",

The gene expression analysis highlighted pathways associated with histological reactions: Damages: DoxMS up-regulated genes vs BlandMS (n=353) were significantly related to (1) cell death, (2) apoptosis (genes revealing DNA damages), and (3) metabolism of doxorubicin (Multidrug resistance gene MDR5). DoxMS down-regulated genes (n=120) were mainly related to hepatic functions: enzymes of lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms. Repair: Among up-regulated genes, clusters of genes proved the liver healing and regeneration. They related to (1) cell proliferation (CTGF, GDF15 and HGS growth factors), (2) tissue remodelling (MMPs and several collagen types), (3) inflammatory reaction (IL6, IL8, CCL2, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL14) and (4) Purpose: We have recently demonstrated (Pascale, et al, SIR 2011) that upregulation of VEGF in VX2 cells increased the tumor volume and reduced necrosis, while upregulation of bFGF reduced the tumor necrosis but had no effect on tumor volume. In this work we searched for difference between the intra tumoral and the peritumoral MVD of these two transfected tumors vs classical VX2 tumors that could explain the differences observed in terms of necrosis extent. Material and Methods: Two VX2 cell line transfected with rabbit VEGF or bFGF cDNAs were multiplied in culture before grafting. White New Zealand rabbits were implanted into leg muscle with VEGF-VX2 (n=5), bFGF-VX2 (n=5), classical VX2 tumors (VX2-Control) (n=8). Animals were sacrificed at D21. Mean vascular density (MVD, vessels/mm 2 ) was quantified by counting CD31 stained vessels into the tumor core (Intra-MVD) and on the tumor edges (Peri-MVD). Necrosis was evaluated on digital images of HES-stained tumors. Results: Intra-MVD was significantly higher in VEGF-VX2 group (102\u00b143) and in bFGF-VX2 group (66\u00b135), vs VX2-control (38\u00b137) (p<0.0001 MW each). Peri-MVD was not different between VEGF-VX2, bFGF-VX2 and VX2-control groups (77\u00b130, 78\u00b131 and 95\u00b147, respectively) (p=0,3462,KW, NS). Conclusion: Transfection of VEGF or bFGF in VX2 cells increased the intra-tumoral vessel density, but not the peri-tumoral one. This supports the hypothesis that intra-tumoral vessels are insufficient in classical non-transfected VX2 tumors to prevent their necrosis. The two transfected tumors could be proposed as models for evaluating small-size drug eluting microspheres in terms of intra-tumoral penetration and antitumoral efficacy.",

In this work, we studied the anti-tumor effect of suspension and emulsion of miriplatin-lipidol for transarterial chemoembolization. Material and Methods: A total of 30 Japanese white rabbits were randomly assigned to ten groups at 2 weeks of VX2 tumor transplantation to the liver. We prepared four types of mixture: a suspension of lipiodol (0.1 ml/kg) and miriplatin (2 mg/kg) (ML), an emulsion of miriplatin dissolved with lipiodol and contrast medium (MLC) or saline (MLS), and saline alone (S). Ratios between ML and contrast media/saline volumes were 1:1/4, 1:1/2, 1:1 and 2:1, respectively. To evaluate the usefulness of the anti-tumor effect, sequential change of the plasma platinum concentration within the first 24 h, as well as the tissue/tumor platinum concentrations at 1 week was measured after intra-arterial infusion of these mixtures. In addition, the reduction rate of the VX2 tumor was calculated among ten therapeutic groups after 1 week of intra-arterial infusion on the basis of 0.3 Tesla MR images. Results: On comparison of the total plasma platinum concentration and the tissue/tumor platinum concentrations, there were no significant differences among these groups. On the other hand, the tumor reduction rate tended to be higher in groups MLC and MLS (group MLC = group MLS > group ML > group S). In terms of emulsion ratios of ML and saline/contrast medium, both combinations at the emulsion ratio of 1:1/2 and 1:1 showed a slightly higher rate in tumor reduction.",

Then histopathologic evaluation was carried out on 3 days (n=2), 1 week (n=1), 2 weeks (n=1), 3 weeks (n=1), 4 weeks (n=2), 6 weeks (n=1), and 8 weeks (n=1) after embolization. Results: In vitro study: ACT were measured 52.0+/-13.2 seconds in the chitosan gel-blood mixture groups and 120.3+/-25.1 seconds in the pure blood groups. In animal study, occlusion ratio of aneurysms in IV-DSA was more than 75% decreased aneurysm size in 7 rabbits (70%), 75%-50% decrease in 2 rabbits (20%), and less than 50% decrease in 1 rabbit (10%). Histopathologic findings showed wellorganization thrombus and neointima formation in the aneurysmal sac. Results: All patients had neurological conditions. 14/15 procedures in 13 patients were successful. In 3/7 cases where replacement button gastrostomies were inserted they re-buried. In 5 cases balloon or loop catheters were used without problems. 1 gastrostomy was not replaced. 5 patients have died with median survival of 691 days . 1 patient with failed removal after previous endoscopic bumper removal and replacement died at 11 days of septic complications following placement of a second gastrostomy. 12/13 patients remained gastrostomy dependant. Otherwise, no technique-specific complications of removal were seen. Conclusion: Buried bumpers occur in patient with underlying neurological conditions after prolonged use of button gastrostomies. The push-pull dilatation technique has a good success rate. Replacement with another bumper catheter is contra-indicated.",

Material and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients (23 women), mean age 38\u00b18 years, previously submitted to CT-guided gastrostomy, due to complications after bariatric surgery. The patients underwent gastrostomy in a mean period of 19 (range 1-54) months after gastric by-pass surgery. Access to the stomach remnant was achieved by the silastic ring, placed during surgery, attaching the remnant to the abdominal wall. The incidence of mucosal detachment was correlated with: stomach wall thickness at entry point, number of needle passes, angle of approach between needle and stomach wall and the distance between needle entry point and the silastic ring. Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) statistical software was employed for calculations. Results: Technical success of gastrostomy tube placement was 29/30 (97%). The incidence of stomach wall dissection was 20/30 (67%). The mean stomach wall thickness at entry site and the mean number of needle passes were 8\u00b13 mm and 3 (range1-9), respectively. The mean angle between needle and stomach wall and the mean ring-needle distance were 35\u00b125 o and 16\u00b111 mm, respectively. Gastrostomy tube was removed after 9\u00b15 months.

However, in patients with pharyngeal or esophageal obstruction, insertion of a nasogastric tube is impossible. We retrospectively investigated the clinical procedural performance of percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy using a combination of sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance without nasogastric tubing. Material and Methods: Between 2001 and 2010, 89 patients underwent percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy because endoscopic procedures were contraindicated. In 17 patients of them, nasogastric tubing was impossible due to pharyngeal or esophageal obstruction (hypopharyngeal cancer 8, cervical esophageal cancer 7, oral cancer 2). The stomach was percutaneously punctured using a fine needle under sonographic guidance and inflated through the needle. Following gastric insufflation, a gastrostomy tube, Ultrathane Friction-Lock Russell Malecot gastrostomy set (COOK), was placed using a single or two gastropexy T-fasteners, Cope gastrointestinal suture anchor set (COOK), under fluoroscopic guidance. Results: Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy without nasogastric tubing was technically successful in all cases. No major complications were observed during the procedure. There were no procedure-related deaths. In one patient, the gastrostomy tube was removed due to stoma infection on the 10th postprocedural day. Conclusion: Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy using a combination of sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance without nasogastric tubing is a practical and safe procedure in patients with pharyngoesophageal obstruction.",

Material and Methods: Women with ultrasound-or MRI-detected placenta praevia, accreta or with a history of previous caesarean section (CS) and an anterior low-lying placenta were included in a prospective observational study. Standard angioplasty balloons were placed (uninflated) in the UAs bilaterally prior to transfer to the obstetric theatre for delivery by CS. The balloons were inflated following delivery and cord clamping. Estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements, transfer times, fetal pH and maternal and fetal complications were recorded. Results: 13 women were included in the study with UA balloons inflated in 11. Balloon occlusion was associated with low mean intraoperative blood loss (880ml) and transfusion requirement (180ml) with no hysterectomies or maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Mean fetal pH was low (7.2, range 6.90-7.44 ) and fetal bradycardia was noted in two women following balloon placement. The most rapid transfer achievable was 28 minutes from onset of fetal distress to delivery. One infant was admitted to neonatal ICU but all were healthy at discharge. Conclusion: In women at high risk, UA balloon occlusion may reduce PPH. However, balloon placement can also cause fetal compromise, possibly due to UA spasm. Fetal risks could be mitigated by eliminating the requirement for transfer.",

Background: UAE is increasingly utilised with a promising risk-benefit profile and good short-term outcomes in the treatment of adenomyosis. Imaging appearances found during follow-up, particularly those of ultrasound, could give cause for concern for the unprepared. For all centres considering embarking on delivery of this service, it is essential to gain knowledge of these features. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: In our practice, routine preprocedure imaging, for both fibroids and adenomyosis, consists of an initial pelvic ultrasound scan followed by an MRI scan, including gadolinium enhancement and angiogram (MRA), to detail arterial anatomy and assess extrapelvic uterine supply. Follow-up imaging consists of an ultrasound scan at one month and an MRI scan at 3 months. The ultrasound, in particular, can have a disconcerting appearance, on occasion mimicking a necrotic infected abscess centred on the uterine cavity, which needs careful clinical correlation. MRI appearances are often more reassuring. The MRI scan at 3 months (which can be brought forward if there are significant clinical concerns) is performed to assess treatment efficacy and to identify potential or late complications.",

This presentation outlines the imaging modalities used and the typical findings seen following UAE for adenomyosis and highlights the need for careful clinical correlation. Purpose: To prospectively assess the technical feasibility and reproducibility of a quantitative foot perfusion multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) technique in patients with PAOD. Material and Methods: After institutional review board approval and informed patient consent were obtained, 10 patients with PAOD referred to our department to undergo a single-limb endovascular treatment were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent dynamic foot 64-row-CT examinations before and after (within 72 hours) endovascular treatment, acquiring eight contiguous 5-mm reconstructed sections, with 60-second acquisition time, during injection of 50 mL of contrast medium (Iomeprol 400 mgI/mL, at 5 mL/sec). Data were analyzed by two experienced blinded readers using a dedicated software to calculate perfusion parameters, such as blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability-surface area product (PS). Interobserver and intraobserver agreement of perfusion CT analysis of untreated foot were statistically assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Blant-Altman analyses. Results: A good interobserver and intraobserver agreement of perfusion CT analysis was obtained in all patients. All perfusion parameters obtained for untreated foot showed good agreement between the two repeated studies. Conclusion: Foot perfusion CT is a feasible and reproducible technique. By providing the functional foot microvasculature, it could be a promising method to select the best treatment available for patients with PAOD; furthermore, in case of endovascular treatment, it could be useful to determine which and how many arteries should be recanalized in order to obtain the best result. and up to 18 months after radioembolization on the basis of echoplanar (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced and hp imaging (flash 2d), after administration of Gd-BOPTA. Lesions were characterized retrospectively by two readers in consensus regarding lesion to liver contrast and dynamic enhancement. A lesion to liver ratio (LLR) was calculated based on signal intensity (SI) measurements. SI changes in different phases of dynamic imaging were detected for the liver as well as focal lesions. Results: Embolized lesions (N=18) were characterized by a significant (p=0.012) increase of SI on late phase imaging combined with a decrease in arterial and portal venous phase. After 6 and 9 months, peak contrast decreased significantly (p=0.028). Non-treated lesions (N =6) demonstrated a significant higher dynamic range (washin and out) compared to embolized lesions (p=0.017). On hp imaging a significant increased contrast media uptake could be demonstrated compared to non-treated lesions (p=0,035). For DWI, only a tendency towards SI decrease was found 3 months after treatment with a significant lower signal after 9 months (p=0.004). Conclusion: Dynamic perfusion changes with an increased uptake on late phase images characterize lesions after radioembolization. The liver-specific contrast agent Gd-BOPTA is a helpful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of radioembolized liver tumors and the detection of tumor recurrence.",

Material and Methods: 40 patients (31 men, 9 women; mean age 70.5 years;) with peripheral arterial occlusive disease underwent both conventional DSA and 64-slice CT-angiography (collimation: 0.625x64mm; 100ml @ 4ml/s Iomeprol 400mgI/ml, Iomeron 400, Bracco Italy ). For each patient the vascular tree was divided into 8 segments from distal aorta to popliteal artery. Each district was evaluated in terms of significant stenosis (>70%) by two experienced vascular radiologists, on axial as well as 3D-CT images. Furthermore, a semi-automated quantitative evaluation of each district was also performed using a 3D-CTA software analysis (ADW 4.3 Volume Viewer 3 Autobone Xpress Pro).

The number of metastatic lesions was counted and as secondary criterion the MR signal intensity increase, measured in the units of contrast/noise ratio (CNR), was assessed. Results: In all cases, localization, form, and configuration and enhancement characteristics of metastases more than 5 mm in size were completely comparable on both sequences. In 10 patients, the SPACE sequence detected 4-19 additional metastases, all less than 5 mm. In none of the patients, MPRAGE was able to detect more metastases. In all patients, CNR was higher with the usage of SPACE, as compared to MPRAGE: if the size of the metastatic lesion was more than 5 mm -4.2 \u00b1 0.7 and 3.1 \u00b1 0.3; if it was less than 5 mm -3.6 \u00b1 1.3 and 2.5 \u00b1 0.5, respectively.

Intravenous contrast-enhanced C-arm CT images were acquired at 2 min after injecting a 90 mL bolus dose of iopamidol via the antecubital vein at the end of each session. Contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) was performed 3-7 days after each RFA session. Ablation margins were measured in 6 orthogonal directions using multiplanar images of both C-arm CT and MDCT, with the preprocedural MDCT images as the reference. The ablation margins obtained from both imaging techniques were statistically compared using a paired t test. -3.2mm , and occluder diameter 25.3+/-4.9mm. 9/10 occluders were leakproof, 1/10 was untight with a small contrast agent rim around the occluder. Conclusion: CMR allows visualization of LAA and selection of optimal LAA occluder size. CMR is feasible in pts after LAA occluder implantation, and seems to be safe for evaluation of device position, size, and tightness. Therefore, CMR is a valuable tool for LAA occluder implantation, and should be routinely used for long-term monitoring.",

Background: CTA is a powerful noninvasive vascular imaging modality. In the upper extremities, CTA is less frequently utilized than in the lower extremities, and the literature on its use is limited. UE-CTA provides fast assessment of the arterial system of the upper extremities and is an extremely helpful modality particularly for interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: UE-CTA is used in our institution for post-traumatic evaluation, pre-operative planning of complex upper extremity reconstructions, atherosclerotic/embolic events, post-surgical or interventional follow-up and thoracic outlet compression syndromes as well as less frequently for collagen vascular diseases and hypothenar hammer syndrome. Images with a collimation of 0.6 mm are acquired from the aortic arch to the digits with the UE of interest extended above the patient's head during the administration of intravenous contrast material through a vein in the contralateral extremity. With this technique stenosis grading and detection of occlusions is reliable to the level of the wrist. At the level of the palmar arches only the detection of occlusions is possible. The digital arteries cannot be confidently assessed with UE-CTA. Conclusion: CTA of the upper extremity is a powerful tool in our imaging arsenal for the evaluation of upper extremity arterial disease.

Background: Before TACE for HCC, it is important to detect tumors using CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) and CT during arterial portography (CTAP). Both are required for the correct diagnosis, because CTHA shows some false lesions such as arterioportal shunts and CTAP does not contain the information of tumor vascularity, but it spends time and effort to take both CTHA and CTAP. ADCT has prominent advantages for time and space resolution compared with conventional helical CT. Therefore, with CTCG using ADCT, we can obtain both CTHA-like imaging and CTAP-like imaging at one examination. Because CTCG individually scans CTHA-like imaging during early phase by arterial flow via hepatic artery and CTAP-like imaging during delayed phase by venous flow via splenic and portal veins. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: CTCG using ADCT scans with the following protocol. 50ml of iodinated contrast medium is injected from celiac trunk at a rate of 5ml/sec, and five-phase CT scans with delay times of every 10 seconds after the start of injection to 50 seconds. The first-phase CT images are like pure CTHA images, and the fourth-or fifth-phase CT images enhanced by splenic and portal venous flow with minimum influence of arterial flow are like CTAP images. Conclusion: CTCG using ADCT substitutes for both CTHA and CTAP. Therefore, it provides us with sufficient information before TACE for HCC.",

To provide a pictorial review of several cases of the congenital coronary sinus anomalies discovered incidentally. Background: Normal venous development is a process of progression and regression of the three major paired venous systems, namely the vitelline, umbilical, and common cardinal veins. The faulty development may result in congenital anomalies. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Coronary sinus anomalies have been classified into five types, including enlargement of the coronary sinus with/without a left-to-right shunt, absence of coronary sinus, atresia of the right atrial coronary sinus ostium, hypoplasia of the coronary sinus, and unroofed coronary sinus. The failure to recognize anomalies in which the coronary sinus is involved may cause a misinterpretation of cardiac catheterization findings, and may cause a troublesome hemodynamic alteration during cardiac surgery. Conclusion: Congenital coronary sinus anomalies are rare and they can occur without any effect on cardiac function and without clinical symptoms or signs.

While the clinical presentation may overlap, there is considerable variation in treatment and prognostic factors. Thus, appropriate imaging and analysis is crucial in correct diagnosis. Background: Popliteal artery narrowing is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Symptoms are related to decreased blood flow to the lower extremity and include insidious and acute symptoms related to limb claudication and ischemia, with the resultant limitations in ambulation, daily functioning and quality of life. Narrowing due to atherosclerotic disease is especially common among smokers, patients with diabetes, the elderly and those with other cardiovascular risk factors. Nevertheless, the etiology of popliteal artery narrowing is broad and a working knowledge of these causal entities is essential in proper patient management and care. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: We present cases of a number of popliteal fossa pathology/popliteal artery narrowing including intrinsic vascular as well as extrinsic musculoskeletal entities such as: atherosclerosis, popliteal artery aneurysm, soft tissue sarcoma, osteochondroma, cystic adventitial disease, abnormal muscle course/popliteal artery entrapment, Baker and gangion cysts, as well as non-occluding cases involving popliteal fossa lymphadenopathy, venous aneurysm/varicosities.

To appreciate the radiological features of KTWS and, in particular, the important role of duplex ultrasound in the assessment of varicosities and magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of arteriovenous malformations prior to percutaneous or surgical treatment. Background: Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS) is a congenital angiodysplasia characterised by a combination of: cutaneous haemangiomata, varicose veins and hypertrophy of bony and soft tissues. Arteriovenous malformations are also a feature of KTWS originally described by Parkes Weber. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: We outline current theories regarding the pathophysiology of KTWS. We describe the imaging features of KTWS, in particular the important role of duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography in planning percutaneous or surgical intervention. Venous malformations and varicosities may be treated in selected patients by percutaneous sclerotherapy and arteriovenous malformations by percutaneous embolisation. We describe the techniques employed with reference to cases treated at our institution. Conclusion: Duplex ultrasound plays an important role in imaging varicosities in KTWS, in particular, prior to sclerotherapy and in assessing the deep veins which are often underfilled on venography. Magnetic resonance imaging is another important non-invasive tool in the assessment of varicosities and the deep venous system. It also has an instrumental role in the assessment of the degree of soft tissue and bony involvement of arteriovenous malformations and is an essential pre-requisite to percutaneous and surgical treatment.",

Preoperatively, the question of the neurological complication following resection arose despite non-invasive imaging showing a normal Circle of Willis. Simultaneous balloon occlusion of the involved artery and brain SPECT allowed objective analysis of regional cerebral perfusion. In our cases it suggested that the artery could be sacrificed without neurologic consequence. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Using a standard cerebral angiogram approach the artery to be sacrificed was selectively cannulated and temporarily occluded with a balloon catheter for up to ten minutes. Simultaneously, technetium exametazime was injected and the patient was clinically assessed. Subsequent delayed phase cerebral SPECT imaging was performed. With visual and quantification analysis of the SPECT study, normal regional cerebral perfusion was demonstrated.",

Background: Anatomically the aortic root is the segment between the left ventricle and the ascending aorta. The components of the aortic root are the aortic annulus, the aortic valve leaflets, the coronary arteries and the sinus of Valsalva. Multidetector CT angiography is the preferred first line imaging modality for the majority of acute aortic root pathology as it is a sensitive and specific non-invasive test which provides detailed and fast volume coverage of the thoracic aorta in a single breath-hold. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The aortic root pathologies can be subdivided anatomically according to whether they involve the aortic valve, the sinuses of valsalva or the aortic wall. Common acute aortic root wall abnormalities are caused by dissections, penetrating ulcers, intramural haematomas and aneurysms. Aortitis and infections are less commonly encountered causes. A detailed pictorial review of aortic root pathology is presented.",

The diagnosis of a post-operative gastrointestinal complication is difficult for the surgeon to make without routine angiography practice. Standard access, catheters, contrast and acquisition techniques were applied. For each pixel of data time density curves were constructed for predefined lengths of vessel. Data were analysed for time to peak and rate rise and then was processed to colour-code for flow dynamics. Conclusion: There is physiologic data already contained in standard DSA data sets that can be processed to deliver an objective measure of flow/perfusion.

Background: In the context of acute hemorrhage, time is crucial and any measure in order to reduce duration of diagnosis and intervention is desirable because it drives to a prompt hemodynamic stabilization of the patient. Moreover, not only reducing time of procedure but also lowering volume of contrast material is needed, because this would prevent further renal damage in patients already at risk of hypovolemic renal failure associated with blood loss. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Here, we present our experience applying 64-slice multidetector computed tomography, multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection and volume rendering images as primary imaging technique for tailoring the best vascular access, the precise anatomical location and the selection of the most appropriate catheter to catheterized the target bleeding vessel. Conclusion: Anatomical variants and anatomical references can easily be noted as traffic signs that permit to avoid excessive contrast material administration and time-consuming procedures.

Background: The spleen is the most commonly injured visceral organ in blunt abdominal trauma. Historically, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Grading System has been used to classify injury and direct management. Recent literature has found this to be a poor predictor of outcome and therefore unreliable. There is a current trend towards splenic preservation and convincing evidence suggests that the most important predictors of failure of non-operative management are the presence of active contrast extravasation (ACE) and splenic vascular injury (SVI Purpose: To demonstrate endovascular treatment options for extracranial internal carotid artery aneurysms and evaluate their usefulness based on treatment success rate and complications. These lesions are rare and are technically challenging for vascular surgeons (difficult anatomy of the region). Material and Methods: There were 47 (25 females and 22 males) patients with extracranial aneurysms (both true aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms) of ICA treated using different endovascular methods. Various endovascular techniques were involved: stenting (with bare and covered stents) in 36 patients, stenting and coil placement in 5 patients and embolisation (ICA trapping, aneurysm coiling, NBCA) in 6 patients. Each procedure was performed after positive BTO. All patients were controlled during follow up which last from 12 months to 5 years. Results: Endovascular treatment was successful in 46 cases. In one patient with an aneurysm which was treated with coils, total exclusion of the aneurismal sac was not achieved. There were no severe complications. Four patients suffered from hematoma in the groin which resolved spontaneously. In three patients in-stent restenosis was observed. Conclusion: Our experience with extracranial carotid aneurysms shows that endovascular treatment of those lesions is both safe and efficient and should be considered a primary treatment option. However, good results depend heavily on proper choice of endovascular equipment and technique. BTO before each procedure is crucial to qualify patients for endovascular treatment.",

Material and Methods: Between April 2009 and December 2010, 132 patients with small 136 HCC nodules underwent RFA guided by contrast harmonic sonography using Sonazoid. The 132 patients were 108 men and 24 women whose age ranged 49 to 85 years (median, 68 years). The size of the 136 nodules was 0.5cm -2.6cm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, 1.4 \u00b1 0.5cm). After intravenous injection of 0.01-ml/Kg Sonazoid, Sonazoid-enhanced harmonic sonography; early vascular imaging and late Kupffer imaging were obtained. RFA was performed, inserting a Cool-tip electrode into a nodule under guidance of Kupffer imaging. Two radiologists assessed whether the Sonazoid-enhanced harmonic sonography was superior or not to the B-mode US; a score of 1 = much better, a score of 2 = better, a score of 3 = equal, or a score of 4 = worse. Results: All 136 nodules were completely ablated. Sonazoidenhanced US was assessed as a score of 1 in 58 nodules (58/136 = 42.6%), a score of 2 in 33 nodules (33/136 = 24.3%), a score of 3 in 45 nodules (45/136 = 33.1%), or a score of 4 in none (0%). A score of 1 was assessed, because Sonazoid-enhanced US detected 32 nodules invisible on B-mode US, intratumoral viable lesions in 16 nodules, and local recurrence in 10 nodules. Conclusion: Guidance of contrast harmonic sonography using Sonazoid was very effective in RFA for small HCC.",

For all procedures, IACT was performed using a hybrid 16-slice CT-angiography system to guide treatment in adjunction to DSA and Tc99-MAA. Retrospective analysis of images and electronic records was performed to retrieve information on position of infusion of Y-90 and type and number of branches coiled. Also, information was obtained on complications due to non-intentional radiation to extra-hepatic organs. Results: In 5.3% of cases (n=4) Y-90 was infused from the proper hepatic artery. In all other cases (94,7%) super-selective infusion was performed. Of all patients, 27.3% (n=21) underwent coiling. The gastroduodenal artery (GDA) and right gastric artery (RGA) both had a coiling rate of 6.5% (n=5). Other coiling rates were as followed: accessory left gastric artery 7.8% (n=6), falciform artery 2.6% (n=2), right inferior phrenic artery 3.9% (n=3), left gastric artery branches in gastrohepatic trunk variant 5.3% (n=4), and left superior phrenic artery originating from the left hepatic artery 2.6% (n=2). Major gastrointestinal complications occurred in 3 patients (3.9%). All three patients had an endoscopically proven acute gastroduodenal ulcer. Conclusion: Super-selective Y-90 infusion guided by IACT in adjunction to DSA enables safe SIRT and limits prophylactic coiling of the GDA and RGA. Purpose: For multipolar hepatic radiofrequency (RF)-ablation it is known that the amount applied energy correlates with the generated coagulation volume. Our goal was to analyze whether the combination of electrodes also influences the ablation volume if the amount of applied energy is kept constant. Material and Methods: In total, 60 RF-ablations were performed in freshly excised bovine liver using a multipolar RF-system (CelonLabPower, Celon AG Medical Instruments, Teltow, Germany). Ten ablations were performed with each of the following RF-applicator combinations: 3x2cm, 3x3cm, 3x4cm, 6x2cm, 6x3cm, 6x4cm. RF-ablations were interrupted after application of 25 kJ. During the experiment time, tissue impedance and generator output were monitored using a dedicated software tool. Generated coagulation zones were dissected and macroscopically measured along x-, y-, and z-axis followed by calculation of the approximate coagulation volume.

Tumor size, site and shape may affect local results. Our aim was to assess feasibility and local results of micro-bland embolization (mb-TAE) performed before RFA for improving post-ablation safety margin in patients with complex liver metastases from CRC. Material and Methods: From may 2006 to December 2010, 15 patients affected by CRC with unresectable liver metastases underwent a combined treatment with TAE followed by RFA, in the same session, for a total of 17 treated lesions. Liver tumors had maximum axial diameter ranging from 18 to 49 mm. Mb-TAE was performed using 100 mm microspheres (Embozene); subsequent RFA was performed by inserting into the tumor a multitined needle under US and/or CT guidance. Initial local tumor response and systemic disease were assessed with CT and PET. The recurrence-free and overall survival rates as well as procedure-related complications were evaluated. Results: Post-treatment unenhanced areas at CT ranged from 37 to 104 mm. Safety margins ranged from 9 to 30.5 mm (mean 13 mm). In all cases complete response at CT and PET was obtained (follow up 1 to 47 months; median 15 months); in one patient relapse of disease was observed at 12 months. Eight patients are still disease free. Seven patients developed new liver metastases or progressive systemic disease during follow-up. No treatment-related major complications were observed. Conclusion: mb-TAE performed immediately before RFA enhances tumor ablation efficacy and expands its role in the treatment of hepatic metastases. However, our experience is limited and further prospective studies are needed. ",

Material and Methods: A total of 525 consecutive patients underwent CT-guided subcarinal biopsy with a co-axial technique and salinoma formation with an extrapleural approach, over a period of 7-1/2 years from March 2003 to November 2010. The nodes were localized with either a single-slice spiral CT (Somatom AR*, Siemens, Erlangen) or a 64-slice multidetector CT (Somatom 64, Siemens, Erlangen). With the patient prone, the pleura was separated from the vertebra using 20 ml injections of saline mixed with lignocaine. A 20-gauge co-axial gun was introduced and multiple tissue samples were obtained. Results: Extrapleural access to the lesions was achieved in 520 (99%) of the 525 cases. In four cases the needle traversed the lung and in one the procedure was abandoned due to pain. Adequate diagnostic samples were obtained in 503 (96%) cases. Diagnoses obtained were non-caseating granulomatous disease in 318 (62%), tuberculosis in 84 (15.25%), sarcoidosis in 45 (9.25%), lymphoma in 38 (9%) and metastasis in 18 (4%). Immediate complications included pneumothorax in 18 (4.5%) patients, managed conservatively, post-procedure pain at the site of needle puncture in 11 (2.75%) and hemothorax in 8 (1.5%) patients. No delayed complications were seen. Conclusion: The extrapleural approach with saline injections yielded 99% technical success. The co-axial method helped achieve diagnostic tissue samples in 96% of the cases. This is a useful technique to biopsy subcarinal lymph nodes and masses.",

Conventional selective arterial infusion chemotherapy for breast cancer has been difficult to continue infusion therapy until satisfactory clinical efficacy was achieved, because of subsequent arterial damage. Therefore, we developed a new redistributed subclavian arterial infusion chemotherapy (RESAIC) method using an implanted catheter-port system after embolization of ITA. We will report the clinical experiences and the efficacy of RESAIC. Material and Methods: Twenty-nine patients with Stage IIIb or IV breast cancers aged from 34 to 82 (median 61) were enrolled in this study between April 2006 and February 2010. At first, the arterial redistribution was achieved by emobolizing ITA using mixture of N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and iodized oil (LPD) via an ipsilateral brachial approach. The tip of an implanted catheter was placed in SCA, and the connected port was implanted in a subcutaneous porch at the forearm. The patients were treated on outpatient basis with the regimen consisted of Cisplatin, 5 FU and Epirubicin, and blood pressure cuff was used during the injection of anticancer drugs to prevent drug perfusion to the arm. Results: The technical success rate was 100%. The local response rate of PR and CR was 88% (CR;14%) was appreciated in relatively short time. There was no serious drug-induced toxicity or procedure-related complications. Conclusion: RESAIC is feasible in clinical use to achieve local control in patients with advanced breast cancers who have no alternative treatment. 12.5-25 mg) . A total of 73 events occurred in 11 patients; 44 events were reported as Grade 1, 20 as Grade 2, and 9 as Grade 3 (3 from a patient with puncture complications), with no Grade 4 events. Mean time between procedure and event was 5 +/-7 days. One patient required hospitalization 7 days post-procedure. Conclusion: Interim data suggest that outpatient-based drug eluting microsphere embolization can be performed safely without significant adverse events with dose ranges as high as 75 mg and minimal reported post-embolization syndrome.

The embolic materials were selected as follows: if extravasations were revealed, we used coils and/or N-butyl 2 cyanoacrylate (NBCA); if extravasations were not revealed, we embolized the feeding artery using NBCA or gelatin sponge. We evaluated the overall survival time and complications. Results: The detection rate of bleeding point was 50% (5/10): carotid artery in one patient, thoracic aorta in one, bronchial artery in one, intercostal artery in one, and left gastric artery in one. In another five cases, the feeding artery was the intercostal artery. The clinical success rate of embolotherapy was 90%. The overall survival was 112 (1-875) days, and one iliac arterial stenosis due to migration of NBCA occurred and was treated by metallic stent. Conclusion: Embolotherapy for gastrointestinal bleeding due to esophageal carcinoma may be considered if it is possible to move the patient to an angiographic room.",

Material and Methods: From May 2009 to August 2010, 28 consecutive patients (18 men, 10 women, mean age 62 years) underwent CT-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) of unresectable lung tumors (11 primary NSCLC and 17 metastases) of mean size 3.2 cm (2.5-8 cm) . The study cohort was selected according to the following criteria: 1) maximum tumor size less than 9 cm in diameter; 2) less than five metastatic tumors; 3) patients with a normal coagulation status; 4) provision of written informed consent. All procedures were performed with CT guidance under conscious sedation and local anesthesia. One or two straight microwave antennae (14 or 16 gauge) were placed directly into the tumor for 8-12 min. Follow-up included contrast-enhanced CT at 1, 3 and 6 months and then at 6-month intervals; stable size or reduction in size and the absence of tumor enhancement CT images were considered indicative of complete tumor necrosis. Results: In all cases, the procedure was technically successful. Morbidity was found in eight cases of partial pneumothorax (28.6%), which resolved spontaneously within 7 days. At a mean follow-up of 8 months (range 2-15), we recorded a 67.8% of complete response (tumor necrosis = 100%) and a 32.2% of partial response (tumor necrosis range, 65-92%). Conclusion: Our preliminary results show that percutaneous CT-guided microwave ablation seems to be feasible, effective and safe for the treatment of lung tumors.",

Material and Methods: A total of 61 patients underwent 62 CT-guided cryoablations during the period of 2001-2005. Saline and air dissection techniques were used. All lesions were simultaneously biopsied. Multiple follow-up CTs were obtained to assess the success. Results: Of the 69 patients who underwent a percutaneous cryoablation, 61 patients were available for analysis with a total of 62 lesions, as one patient had two lesions. Local control of the neoplasm was obtained in 48 of 61 patients (78.8%) after one cryoablation cycle and in 59 of 61 patients (96.7%) after two or three cryoablations using three cryoprobe cycles.

Material and Methods: We treated 116 hepatic unresectable lesions (74 HCC, 6 Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 36 metasases from gastroenteric cancer) in 87 patients (mean age 69.8 years). Mean diameter of the lesions was 29.6 mm (range 8-79 mm); We used a microwave generator (AMICA-GEM apparatus for microwave ablation) connected to a 14-or 16-gauge coaxial antenna working at 2450 MHz and endowed with a miniaturized sleeve choke to reduce back heating effects and increase the sphericity of the area of necrosis. Contrast-enhanced CT scan was carried out 30 days after thermal ablation, and then every 3 months to assess therapeutic efficacy. Results: Complete necrosis was achieved in 87% of patients with HCC (necrosis was 98% if we only considered the nodules \u226430 mm) and in 78% of patients with metastases (necrosis was 89 % if we only considered the nodules \u226430 mm).

Material and Methods: 600 patients were treated in our center between Sep 2007 -December 2010: 110 -hormone-resistant, 229 -received neoadjuvant hormone therapy 6 months, 235 -no treatment before HIFU, 26 -after the EBRT failure. 454 patients underwent TURP+rHIFU, 55 only rHIFU (volume prostate <40cc). Mean follow-up is 32 months (range 3-40). All patients were divided into 3 groups: low-risk progression (Gleason <7, stage T1-2N0M0, PSA<20, number of patients 337), high-risk progression -(Gleason \u22649, stage T2-3N0M0, PSA <60, number of patients 183), after EBRT failure (number of patients 26). Results: Median PSA level 12 months after rHIFU treatment were 0,04 ng/ml -low-risk group, for high-risk group -0,5 ng/ml, with failure after EBRT -0,5 ng/ml; 30 months after rHIFU treatment were 0,2 ng/ml -low-risk group, for high-risk group -2,7 ng/ml, with failure after EBRT -1,5 ng/ml. Patients with low risk had 4,5% of progression, with high-risk PC -25%, with failure after EBRT 19,6%. Kaplan-Meier analyses of the total group indicated that the risk of progression was 21% after 3 years of follow-up. Complications: incontinence I 17,5%, incontinence II 7,7%, stricture 18,2%, fistula 0,5%.

Background: Embolization of right portal vein induces hypertrophy of the left liver lobe and so the patients become suitable for right lobectomy as an adequate liver function is accomplished. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Nineteen patients were admitted to our department in the last 3 years with diagnosed space occupying lesion in right liver lobe. They underwent preoperative percutaneous embolization of the right portal vein with tissue glue and with metallic coils in some cases. The access was performed percutaneously under ultrasound guidance, through the right liver lobe in 16 patients and through the left liver lobe in 3 patients. The method was technically successful in all patients regardless the way of access. No complications occurred, apart from the post-embolic pain. The imaging control that took place between 2 and 5 months after the procedure revealed a 10%-60% increase of the remnant hepatic parenchyma. The 14 of 19 patients were later on operated successfully with right lobectomy. In 3 of 19 patients the regeneration of left lobe appeared to be insufficient for right lobectomy whereas 2 patients developed at the meantime multiple metastatic lesions to the whole liver. These 5 patients were then successfully managed with chemoembolization. Conclusion: Percutaneous embolization of portal vein is a safe and adequate method for the volume increase of contralateral liver, but also does not exclude other possible therapeutic approaches. Learning objectives: We evaluated the nephrotoxicity of miriplatin in comparison to cisplatin in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Background: At transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) to treat HCCs, various anticancer drugs are mixed with iodized oil (LPS). The strong dose-response relationship of cisplatin (CDDP), an anti-neoplastic agent with demonstrated activity against a variety of response. All examinations were interpreted blindly by two radiologists and afterwards CEUS findings were compared with MDCT by an experienced radiologist in abdominal imaging. Results: In 33 nodules a complete response was obtained in 26 nodules and incomplete response in the other 7. Percentage of complete response was 78,7%. Post-DC-beads chemoembolisation, CEUS was able to detect 6 of 7 cases with residual tumor. The results obtained with CEUS agreed with those obtained with MDCT in all cases, rendering a diagnostic accuracy of 100%. There was no statistically significant difference in overall diagnostic accuracy between MDCT and CEUS in the evaluation of residual tumor (p > .05). Conclusion: CEUS represents a cost effective and valuable tool in the evaluation of the outcome of chemoembolisation with DC-beads in HCC.",

Material and Methods: Primary stent placement for iliac artery occlusive disease has been performed for 74 claudicants with 94 limbs having both iliac and SFA occlusive disease. Treatment for SFA lesions was not performed concomitantly. Mean age of the patients was 73 years. Rutherford classification was 2 in 20 limbs, and 3 in 74 limbs. Median duration of follow-up was 40 months (1-100 months). We evaluate the initial clinical improvement rate and continued clinical improvement rate in long-term follow-up retrospectively. Results: Initial technical success rate and initial clinical improvement rate of the iliac stent placement was 100% and 87%, respectively. Continued clinical improvement rate at 7 years was 64%. Dividing the SFA lesions to Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC)-II A/B group (n=49) and TASC-II C/D group (n=45), continued clinical improvement rate at 7 years in the TASC-II A/B group (75%) was significantly higher compared with TASC-II C/D group (54%; p=0.02, Log-rank test). Conclusion: Initial improvement of intermittent claudication was obtained in most of cases after revascularization of inflow vessels. Moreover, continued improvement rate was relatively high in TASC-II A/B SFA lesions, treatment strategy with iliac artery stenting in patients with both iliac artery and SFA lesions, especially TASC-II A/B lesions, is acceptable. However, aggressive follow-up and additional revascularization for SFA lesions may be required for patients with TASC-II C/D SFA lesions. ",

We retrospectively reviewed exam reports from C-arm CT rotational TMJ studies between October 2007 and March 2010. We extracted patient age and dose-area-product (DAP) from each rotation and reviewed information such as the dose options and thickness of Cu. Results: 24 rotations (Group A) were performed prior to the implementation of the optimized TMJ C-arm CT protocol, 62 were performed after (Group B). The average age was: Group A, 12.7+4.8y (87%>10y), Group B, 13.6+4.1y (85%>10y), and the average DAPs were 357.9 and 19.1 microGym2, respectively. The difference in average DAPs reflects a radiation dose reduction of 95% using the optimized techniques, close to the 94% predicted by our phantom study. The optimized dose is approximately half the radiation dose from that of a conventional low dose TMJ CT with the same z-direction collimations.

X-ray system (biplane with flat detectors) was under a quality assurance program and patient dose records were archived individually according to the national regulations. Results: A total of 325 procedures (43% therapeutic, mainly cerebral embolizations) were included in the database during 2009 and either alone or in combination with needle holders. Each device and combination was used three times by each IR. Needle paths were equally difficult. Results: Lowest fluoroscopy time to reach the target was 31s for SimpliCT and the combination SimpliCT-needle holders (all data presented as median [ranges] ). Freehand and needle holders alone was twice as high (62s ). Using SimpliCT and combination SimpliCT-needle holders resulted in the lowest operator hand dose: 33\u03bcSv per procedure. This compared to 275\u03bcSv for freehand, 298\u03bcSv [80-875] and 167\u03bcSv for SeeStar and Simplify, respectively. For both fluoroscopy time and dose, laserguided procedures are significantly lower than non-laser-guided procedures (p<0.01). Accuracy needle-to-target was \u00b11mm for all needle devices. Conclusion: Laser guidance, alone or in combination with needle holders, achieves superior results of both reduced fluoroscopy time and operator radiation dose while affording good accuracy.",

Monthly occupational dose values were compiled and analysed together with the workload. Only doses reflecting regular use of the dosimeters were used. Participants were also asked to fill in a questionnaire on the use of personal dosimeters and radiological protection tools. Results: 1133 dose values under the apron, 280 over the apron and 856 from hand dosimeters were received at the central database. 35% of the interventionalists did not use the dosimeter properly, so their records were excluded from the analysis. Most professionals remained in the control room during the acquisition of the DSA series. The use of the ceiling suspended protection screen was irregular.

Background: The number, complexity and length of interventional x-ray procedures are steadily increasing, contributing to higher radiation exposure of personnel (radiologists, radiographers and technicians). Especially the flexibility that modern interventional x-ray systems offer leads to a large number of adjustable system settings. The effects of these settings on personal dose, however, are not always clear. Current personal dose meters used in radiation safety training sessions do not always allow real time monitoring of the actual personal dose rate or do not allow comparison of different meters and/ or situations simultaneously. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The Philips Doseaware system consists of up to 8 personal dose meters wirelessly connected to a central display unit showing actual dose rate. This system was used in a Philips FD20 interventional x-ray suite with a water phantom to create scatter comparable to clinical procedures. The most common factors resulting in staff dose, like fluoro modes, tube position and angulation, table height and use of protective devices, were evaluated to give insight in their relative contributions. Conclusion: These teaching sessions clearly demonstrated that realtime feedback of personal dose per role in an interventional x-ray suite elevated the understanding of relative dose contribution with respect to common parameters in interventional procedures and might lead to a reduction in personal dose.",

To understand that optimization requires the consideration of both, patient and staff radiation doses. To identify optimization strategies to reduce patient and staff radiation doses. Background: The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the coming European Directive on Basic Safety Standards consider staff radiation risks together with patient doses, in the optimization of medical procedures. This new consideration is especially relevant in interventional radiology. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: A real time personal dosimetry system (DoseAware) informing staff on cumulative occupational radiation doses and dose rates, during interventional fluoroscopy-guided procedures, permits verifying the level of scatter radiation during the operation in angiography suites. Since 2000, interventional X-ray systems have shown patient doses inside the angiography room, but displaying staff doses in real time was only made possible in 2010. Both parameters (staff and patient doses) recorded during interventional procedures enable to avoid pitfalls and to improve the protection in a proactive way. Strategies to reduce patient and staff doses are easily introduced: low dose operation modes, short fluoroscopy and image acquisition runs, collimation, good geometrical factors, appropriate use of protection tools, etc. Conclusion: Staff dose audit in real time during interventional procedures allows correcting situations of high radiation risk for staff while avoiding high dose operation modes for patients and thus improving the global optimization.",

The angioplasty balloon catheter was placed over the neck of the aneurysms extending to the distal branch to protect the parent artery from coil protrusion by temporary balloon occlusion. A macrocatheter was advanced into the aneurysm, through which IDC-18 coils were placed in two cases and GDC-18 360\u00b0coils in the other two cases. The procedure was finalized when the aneurysm was fully packed with the coils and there was no more contrast filling visible in the sack. Results: In four patients, the wide-necked saccular aneurysms were excluded without coil protrusion, migration in the parent artery or sacrifice of any branch arteries. For occlusion of the aneurysm, seventeen IDC-18 coils (10-30 mm in diameter and 10-20 cm in length) were placed in one, sixteen IDC 18 coils (18-30 mm in diameter and 20 cm in length) were in the other one. Remaining two obtained dense packing with each six GDC-18 360\u00b0coils (9-20 mm in diameter, 20-40 cm in length). One-year follow-up showed no aneurysm recanalization or arterial obstruction in all cases. Conclusion: Balloon remodeling technique utilizing IDCs and GDCs is technically feasible and safe in the treatment of a wide-necked saccular RAAs.

Essential knowledge of various devices. 4) Adjunctive techniques (Balloon assist technique and stent assist technique). Background: In this presentation, tips and tricks of each process of embolization are explained with actual strategy and angiographical movies of various lesions, such as celiac artery, hepatic artery, splenic artery, gastroduodenal artery, superior mesenteric artery and renal artery. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Working angle should be defined to visualize the relation between dome, neck and parent artery clearly. Planning of approaches to the aneurysms is crucial, which closely relate the stability of microcatheter and usage of adjunctive techniques. Guiding sheaths allow the simultaneous use of multiple catheters or adjunctive techniques with single access. Balloon catheter is useful not only for prevention of coil migration but also for stabilization of microcatheter during coil placement and for temporal occlusion in case of unexpected intraoperative rupture. Knowledge of advanced mechanism of various coils is essential for adequate coil selection on framing, filling and finishing. This report includes some unique cases such as: aneurysm of gastroduodenal artery caused by secondary hemodynamic change after treatment of celiac trunk aneurysm. Aneurysm of renal artery embolized using double microcatheter with single vascular access from brachial artery due to iatrogenic bilateral femoral artery occlusion. Conclusion: Detailed anatomical analysis, cautious planning, knowledge of devices and advanced technique are essential to bring good outcomes on coil embolization of visceral arterial aneurysms. and resistive index of both renal arteries, estimated GFR and pressure Holter were done previously, at 30 and 90 days after the procedure. Blood-pressure lowering effectiveness was evaluated by Student's t test. Results: In the treated patients, baseline mean office blood pressure was 171/102 mmHg (SD 34/21), (mean 4-7 antihypertensive medications); mean GFR was 92.6 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (SD 15). Office blood pressure after procedure was reduced by -24/-15 and -23/-12 mmHg at 1 and 3 months. In all patients, medical therapy was reduced in both number and drugs dosage. No complications were observed. Conclusion: The therapeutic sympathetic renal denervation is an innovative, fast and safe percutaneous procedure for the treatment of hypertension refractory to conventional therapy. The clinical and procedural efficacy has been demonstrated by the achievement of significant reductions in blood pressure, without significant complications. Despite the encouraging results, confirmation on prospective randomized studies to definitively validate the technique is mandatory.",

Three-month follow-up CTA showed complete obliteration with shrinkage of aneurysmal sac. Learning objectives: To describe the interventional management of visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs). To report the indications and the techniques in relation to the type of aneurysm. To highlight their advantages and drawbacks and illustrate them step by step. Background: VAAs, although uncommon, can present with lifethreatening haemorrhage and a mortality rate ranging between 10 and 25%. Treatment options have significantly evolved over the past decade ranging from open surgical repair to interventional management. Open surgical repair is the standard treatment, durable with excellent long-term results, but it is associated with morbidity and mortality rates of approximately 10% and 5%, respectively, but substantially higher in the emergency setting. Interventional methods have emerged as promising therapies to treat visceral artery aneurysms. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Based on a retrospective review of the VAAs treated with interventional techniques in our department, and on a literature search, we provide details on when and how to treat patients with VAAs, tips and tricks, how to avoid complications, and how to manage them when they occur. Conclusion: Interventional techniques such as embolization, stent grafting, stent-protected coiling and multilayer stents are successful in the treatment of VAAs with minimal morbidity and mortality.",

Patient underwent a portogram demonstrating DV being drained by portal collaterals entering the liver and by portosystemic collaterals. A trans-TIPS balloon occluded transvenous obliteration was performed utilizing 3% sotradecol-lipiodol-air mixture as a sclerosant. The balloon was used to occlude the main portal vein-end of the DV and coils were deployed to occlude the intrahepatic-end of the varices at the hepatic hilum outside the wall of the duodenum.

Two varices were sufficiently obliterated by B-RTO alone, while one was insufficient and was treated successfully by additional PTS (percutaneous transhepatic sclerotherapy) 7 days after first B-RTO. In all cases, no complication was found. Conclusion: Transcatheter embolization is feasible and effective procedure for the small intestinal varices.",

Background: HE is a potentially serious complication following TIPS, occurring in 20-40% of patients. Most patients are successfully managed with conservative medical therapy. However, 3-7% of patients will suffer from HE which is refractory to medical therapy. These patients require further intervention through endovascular shunt reduction, endovascular complete shunt occlusion or, where possible, the use of liver transplantation. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Several endovascular techniques have been described which act to reduce flow by increasing turbulence within the shunt lumen. Each technique will be described in detail, highlighting our own experience, with a discussion of the advantages and potential pitfalls of each procedure. ",

Material and Methods: Design: Two treatment arms, randomized enrollment of 91 patients. Inclusion criteria: Clinical Rutherford stage 1-5, occlusion or hemodynamic relevant stenosis (\u226570 % diameter) of femoropopliteal arteries, successful guide wire passage.

Minko, A. Buecker, M. Katoh;Diagnostic And Interventional Radiology, Saarland University Hospital, Homburg/Saar, Germany.Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and to evaluate possible risk factors of the Angio-Seal vascular closure device after antegrade puncture. Material and Methods: 105 consecutive patients with antegrade access to the common femoral artery (CFA) for lower limb vascular intervention were included into this prospective study. After intervention, 6F (n=76) and 8F (n=29) Angio-Seal vascular closure devices (St. Jude Medical Inc., USA) were used to achieve hemostasis. The platelets, INR, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), calcifications and prior surgical interventions of the CFA as well as the body-massindex (BMI) were documented and the influence on technical success was analyzed. Results: Immediate hemostasis was reached in 85 patients. In six patients a kink of the sheath obviated the passage of the collagen sponge towards the vessel; in another 14 patients persistent bleeding of the puncture site required manual compression. There was no significant difference between the groups of successful and unsuccessful sealing regarding the mean platelets (242 vs. 216 *10 9 /l), INR (1.06 vs 1.02), prothrombin time (89 vs. 89%) and PTT(29 vs. 31 s).",

The calculated ICER for group S was 6518\u20ac (range, 1685-10112\u20ac) and 11581\u20ac for group E (range, 4945-21428\u20ac) per event-free life-year gained. Conclusion: Both strategies of provisional and primary drug-eluting stent placement in the infrapopliteal arteries for critical limb ischemia treatment exhibit single-digit NNT and low corresponding ICER.Ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis for the treatment of pulmonary embolismT. Engelhardt1  , A.J. Taylor 2 , L. Simprini 2 ; 1 Louisiana Heart Lung & Vascular Institute, East Jefferson General Hospital, Metairie, LA, United States Of America, 2 Cardiology, Washington Hospital Center, Washington DC, United States Of America. Purpose: Our single center experience is reported on the use of ultrasound accelerated thrombolysis (USAT) for endovascular management of intermediate and high-risk PE patients. Material and Methods: Between February 2009 and July 2010, 22PE patients were treated using the EKOS EkoSonic Endovascular System (EKOS Corporation, Bothell, WA) and rt-PA. Preliminary and post-treatment CT scans were performed on 21 patients. The primary endpoint was mortality. Secondary endpoints were improvement in the right ventricular to left ventricular end diastolic diameter ratio (RV/LV ratio) and reduction in clot burden. Results: All 22 treated patients survived. In the 21 patients with CT scans, the average RV/LV ratio pre-treatment was 1.33 \u00b1 0.23 and 1.00 \u00b1 0.13 post-treatment (p < 0.001). Clot burden, calculated from the CT scans using the modified Miller score (maximum 36), was reduced from17.8 \u00b1 7.4  to 10.0 \u00b1 4.0. Major bleeding complications occurred in 4 patients, all 4 requiring transfusion. Minor bleeding complications occurred in 2 patients. No other complications were observed. All bleeding complications were reported in the first 14 patients, who received an average of 47.6 mg of rt-PA delivered over 22 hours. The dosing regimen for rt-PA was reconsidered and reduced in the remaining 8 patients to an average dose of 20.8 mg of rt-PA over 14.3 hours, and no further bleeding complications were reported.",

Claussen 1 , G. Tepe 2 ; 1 Diagnostic And Interventional Radiology, University of Tuebingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany, 2 Department Of Diagnostic And Interventional Radiology, Medical Centre of Rosenheim, Rosenheim, Germany. Purpose: To investigate the influence of dual antiplatelet therapy vs. Aspirin alone on local platelet activation and clinical endpoints in patients treated with endovascular therapy. Material and Methods: MIRROR was performed as a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. 40 patients received Aspirin 500 and Clopidogrel 300 before intervention and were furthermore treated with a daily dose of Aspirin 100 and Clopidogrel 75. 40 patients received same doses of Aspirin and Placebo instead of Clopidogrel. Primary endpoints were concentration of activation markers \u03b2-thromboglobulin and CD40L in the blood after having rotated in the Chandler-Loop vessel model and rate of patients resistant to Clopidogrel. The clinical development 6 months after the intervention was assessed. Results: Concentration of \u03b2-TG in the Clopidogrel vs. Placebo group was 224.5 vs. 365.5 (p=0.03). Concentration of CD40L was 127 vs. 206.5 (p=0.05). 30% who received Clopidogrel were resistant on loading dose. 2 Clopidogrel and 8 Placebo patients required target lesion revascularization (p=0.04). Each of the 2 Verum patients who needed revascularization was resistant to Clopidogrel. Minor bleeding complications occurred at 1 Clopidogrel and 2 Placebo patients. Conclusion: Periinterventional platelet activation can be reduced by combination of Clopidogrel and Aspirin. Clopidogrel+Aspirin can improve functional outcome and is a safe treatment. These results support dual antiplatelet therapy during and after peripheral arterial interventions. 2908.2 Endovascular peripheral and visceral aneurysms repair with cardiatis multilayer stent: Italian Multicenter Registry results at 6 and 12 months FU M.A. Ruffino, P.

All patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast enhancement and computed tomography (CT). Almost all patients showed good response after initial PV. Sixty-one patients developed recurrent pain following successful PV within a year. Of them, 57 revealed subsequent fracture in the adjacent or distant vertebra from the treated vertebra. Another 4 patients who complained of recurrent pain demonstrated only fluid sign at the bone-cement interface without obvious compression fracture. Results: In all these 4 patients, large cavity formation (cleft) in the vertebral body was noted and there was destruction of the posterior wall of the vertebra in preoperative MRI and CT. Definite mismatch was noted in fluid cleft size on STIR images and ill-enhanced area around the enhanced area of fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced images on preoperative MRI. This mismatch area was consisted to be necrotic debris which was thought to be responsible for development of fluid in the treated vertebra. Conclusion: Fluid sign in the treated body represents unhealed bone-cement interface and cement instability. The existence of a large cleft (vacuum or fluid filled) in the treated vertebrae and destruction of vertebral posterior wall may be important factors influencing instability of the injected cement.",

Advances in MR imaging techniques, that include diffusion MR imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, can provide in vivo metabolic information. Recent studies demonstrated that water diffusion can be used to differentiate viable and cellular regions from necrotic area in the tumor, regardless morphologic or dimensional changes. Viable tumors have intact cells that restrict the motion of water molecules, reducing ADC value; on the other hand, necrotic regions allow free diffusion of water molecules and increase ADC value. This additional information could enhance the morphologic findings of baseline and dynamic MR study. Moreover, new classes of antitumor therapy have been developed that have an antiproliferative effect, inducing a delay in tumor shrinkage.

Since the size of the microspheres used for RE is quite small (<30 microns) they can reach the terminal vessels that vascularize the bile ducts. For this theoretical reason, bile duct complications (i.e., stenoses) could be observed after RE. Cholecystitis is a complication that may appear in any patient treated by an endovascular procedure in which particles are infused into the cystic artery. It is not uncommon however, to find asymptomatic cases in which there is a decrease in the size of the gallbladder with histologic evidence of dense fibrosis associated with the presence of particles within the gallbladder wall.

When coils or other embolic materials are not indicated or cannot be deployed safely, Onyx\u00ae liquid embolizer should be considered as an appropriate life-saving tool to stop the bleeding. Familiarity with this liquid embolizer is crucial in Interventional Radiology.Learning objectives:Brief thematic review on the subject percutaneous embolization of varicocele grade II to IV, with illustration of the technique, enumeration of the complications and analysis of the obtained therapeutic effects. Background: The authors retrospectively assessed 50 cases of percutaneous embolization of clinically detectable varicoceles, performed at the HUC, in the period between January 2009 and January 2011. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The varicocele consists of varicose dilation of pampiniform plexus and spermatic vein and may present with pain, testicular atrophy and male infertility. It affects 15% of men, being present in 40% of the infertile male population. Usually unilateral and more frequent on the left side, it may be bilateral (9%) and present on the right (1-2%). The indications for treatment are symptomatic varicoceles, adolescents with a decrease in testicular volume and infertile adults with multiple alterations in semen. Through the clinical evaluation and semen analysis, when available, the authors demonstrate the good results in terms of efficacy and safety. Conclusion: Percutaneous varicocele embolization is a minimally invasive technique of interventional radiology without the need for general anesthesia or stitches/scars, providing a rapid recovery of the patient, with a short hospital stay and therapeutic results similar to surgery.Isolation technique on transcatheter coil embolization for gastrointestinal hemorrhage in an angiographically unvisualized right hepatic arterial branchY.

Indications for endovascular intervention were traumatic aortic tear (n=27), acute type B dissection (n=19), ruptured degenerative aneurysm (n=19), intramural hematoma (n=3), penetrating ulcer (n=3), penetrating injury (n=3), and embolizing lesion (n=2). Indications for open repair were ruptured degenerative aneurysm (n=22), acute type B dissection (n=1), and penetrating ulcer (n=1). A variety of stent-grafts were used including TAG excluder (N=41), aortic cuffs (n=25), custom-made devices (n=8), and Talent (n=1). All open repairs were performed using an interposition graft. Results: Mean age was 58.5 years. In-hospital mortality occurred in 37 patients (TEVAR n=21, 28% vs DTAR n=16, 67%, P=0.0012). The incidence of post-operative myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, stroke, and paraplegia/paresis were similar between the two groups (TEVAR 5%, 12%, 8%, 8% vs DTAR 13%, 13%, 9%, 13%, P>0.05). The major respiratory complications and other complications were higher in the DTAR group (TEVAR 16%, 20% vs DTAR 48%, 83%, P<0.05). Median follow-up is 12 months (range 0-83). Predictors of patient mortality included patient age and patients with DTAR vs TEVAR. Conclusion: Most patients presenting with ACDTA can be successfully treated with TEVAR with diminished risks of mortality and major complications.

Tawfick;  Vascular Department, Western Vascular Institute, Galway, Ireland.    Purpose: 33 TEVAR were performed for 31 patients (13 females:18 males) over a period of 36 months of which six were emergencies. The mean age was 64.6 years. 26 patients were ASA grade III or more. Material and Methods: Risk factors were hypertension (n=20), hypercholesterolaemia (n= 17), smoking (n=14) and ischaemic heart disease (n=9). 17 procedures were for thoracic abdominal aneurysms type three, 7 thoraco-abdominal aneurysms type four, 4 aortic dissection Type B, 1 infantile adult aortic coarctation and 2 spontaneous supra visceral aortic ruptures. Seven patients underwent a one-/ two-stage hybrid debranching of visceral vessels followed by TEVAR. Fourteen patients underwent chimney or Snorkel endografting of subclavian or renal vessels. Two patients underwent multilayered stenting for thoraco-abdominal aneurysms with visceral involvement. One patient had a CPS stent for infantile adult coarctation. Results: Primary endpoints were 6% mortalities within 30 days for the two acute emergencies of which one was a HIV patient with syphilitic aneurysm. 30-day morbidity was one acute tubular necrosis and one lower respiratory tract infection. Aneurysm free survival time was 19 months. No patients developed aneurysm rupture, paraplegia or stroke. Four cases of endoleak were witnessed; however, no aneurysm expansion was experienced. Two patients required re-intervention for graft migration. Conclusion: We display from our experience that minimal invasive techniques with TEVAR and debranching, chimney, snorkel and multilayered stent grafting of visceral vessels are safe, prudent and economically viable.

Hynes; Vascular Department, Western Vascular Institute, Galway, Ireland.Purpose: Between 1996 and 2009, of 2868 patients referred with AAA disease, 575 have had AAA repair, performed by one specialist vascular team and two general surgery teams. Material and Methods: From 1996 to 2009 our mean patient age has risen by an average of 0.5% per annum from 71 years in 1996 to 78 years in 2009 (p=0.023). There has been a concomitant significant rise in SVS co-morbidity score (P<0.001), Kertai-probability index (P<0.01), SVS anatomical score (P<0.01) and the Australasian endovascular aneurysm repair risk assessment (ERA) model (P<0.05) when comparing 1998 to 2009. The percentage of endovascular repairs has increased from 0 to 91% and despite an increase in complexity and a percentage increase of Pararenal repair of <1% in 1996 to 31% in 2009, there has been a consistent drop in peri-operative mortality and morbidity rates. Elective operative mortality prior to the establishment of a specialist deliberate practice volume centre and priorCardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe to the introduction of endovascular techniques in 2002 was 15.7% per annum compared to 1.8% since 2002 (P<0.0001). Results: Freedom from major adverse events (MACE) has increased over the last decade from 28% to 78% (p=0.0009, h=0.32 [95%CI=0.17 to 0.61]). Cox proportional hazards ratio showed that age, gender, SVS co-morbidity score, Kertai-probability index, SVS anatomical score and ERA Model score did not influence 5-year aneurysm-related survival or freedom from MACE. Conclusion: Procedural innovation, minimally invasive technologies and enhanced understanding of the management of high-risk factors have led to substantial upturn in aneurysm survival rates and a profound recuperation of both quality of life and cost-effectiveness.A 10-year single centre experience of endovascular stent graft repair for traumatic thoracic aortic injuries D.G.

We present our 10-year results in a level I trauma centre. Material and Methods: Data from 23 consecutive patients with acute traumatic thoracic aortic injuries who were treated with endovascular stent graft insertion, between October 2001 -January 2011 were prospectively analysed. Demographic information along with injury features, insertion technique and complications during and following insertion were recorded. Patients followed up with computed tomography and chest radiographs at regular intervals. Average follow up has been 47 months. Results: All patients underwent technically successful endovascular repair. Two patients required carotid-carotid bypass and another required a chimney carotid stent during the procedure. No patients required conversion to open repair. Paraplegia rate was zero, although two patients had cerebral infarcts. Complications included one incident of stent migration, one stent graft collapse and two avulsed iliac arteries. There were two type I endoleaks treated at the time of insertion. Conclusion: Traumatic aortic injury is potentially life threatening with a high mortality if untreated. These patients often present with multiple coexisting injuries complicating open surgical repair and increasing risk of mortality. Endovascular repair of traumatic thoracic aortic injuries is an effective and feasible alternative to surgery, with low mortality and morbidity.

McEniff 1 ;  1  Radiology, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, 2 Interventional Radiology, St James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. objectives: To assess the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for EVAR surveillance and endoleak detection using an evidence-based radiology approach. Background: Endoleak occurs in up to 20% of patients and is a serious complication, associated with increased risk of aneurysm rupture. Regular surveillance is mandatory for early detection of complications. CT angiography (CTA) is the current gold standard imaging modality for EVAR surveillance. This carries risks of cumulative exposure to ionising radiation, nephrotoxic contrast media and high costs. Recent studies have shown that sonographic contrast agents can increase the capability of ultrasound to detect endoleaks whilst avoiding the inherent risks of CTA. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The centre for evidencebased medicine approach was adopted to perform an evidencebased review of the literature. This entails four steps: to formulate an answerable question using the PICO format, to search the primaryCIRSE Annual Meeting and Postgraduate Course and secondary literature, to identify papers with the highest level of evidence and critically appraise them, to form conclusions, and apply to daily practice. This yielded eleven relevant articles, including one systematic review (level 2A) and eight prospective cohort studies (level 2B). These papers were critically appraised. Conclusion: CEUS is highly sensitive (0.98) for the detection of endoleak in EVAR patients (level 2A evidence). Although its exact role in EVAR follow-up is still unclear, CEUS offers promise as a safe and sensitive screening tool which should be integrated into patient surveillance.

Background: Patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm confirmed by contrast-enhanced computed-tomography-angiography were eligible for the analysis. Out of a group of 67 patients, 42 patients (62.7%) were treated with endograft. Thirteen patients (30.9%) received an aorto-uni-iliac endograft (group A), and 29 a bifurcated endograft (group B). Patients were divided for comparative analysis according to the configuration of the endograft implanted. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Primary technical success rate was 100%; primary clinical success rate was 95% (40/42). There were 2 intra-operative deaths (4.7%) related to intractable shock. No patient required conversion to open repair. Overall, a total of 12 patients (28.5%) died within 30 days. Hospitalization death rate was 30.9% (13/42). Hospital mortality was statistically higher in group A;type of endograft and intensive care unit admission were the only independent predictors of hospital mortality. Conclusion: In our experience, an higher mortality rate for the aorto-uni-iliac configuration was observed; shock at admission was confirmed the most important factor for postoperative survival.Percutaneous contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided thrombin injection for endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm: a pictorial reviewM. Mazon, G. Cabrera, M. Atar\u00e9s, A. Ruiz, T. Ripolles, E. Lonjedo;Radiology, Hospital Universitario Doctor Peset, Valencia, Spain. objectives: Our purpose is to describe the technique of percutaneous contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided thrombin injection for endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, to illustrate the radiological findings and procedure, and to provide some examples with CT correlation. Background: Endoleaks are the most common complication of placed endovascular stented grafts. Patients with endoleak should either be closely followed or be treated. Endoleaks type II are generally treated by embolization; however, it is not always technically possible and percutaneous thrombin injection is a good method. CT is the preferred modality for evaluation of the graft and for guiding percutaneous embolizations in some endoleaks. Percutaneous contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided thrombin injection in appropriate patients is a good option, and it allows continuous visualization and real-time monitoring of the thrombus formation. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: An accurate baseline US and color Doppler exploration is always performed prior to contrast-enhanced study (Pulse inversion, Toshiba). Immediately after intravenous administration of the contrast agent (Sonovue), the harmonic mode is switched on, and the percutaneous thrombin injection is guided. A continuous visualization of the thrombus formation in real time is allowed with this non-ionizing technique. Conclusion: Endoleaks are well-recognized complications of aortic endovascular stented grafts. Contrast enhanced ultrasound has emerged as an alternative imaging technique in the diagnosis of endoleaks and for guiding percutaneous embolizations, being as accurate as CT, and it allows continuous visualization of the thrombus formation.",

To give an overview on the imaging findings regarding hybrid procedures for complex thoracic aortic pathology. Background: Endovascular repair of complex thoracic aortic pathology is emerging as the preferred treatment strategy in certain patients, as increasing data suggest that endovascular repair may be performed with lower peri-operative morbidity and mortality rates and similar midterm survival, when compared with standard open repair. However, because of anatomic constraints related to required endograft seal zones, a significant number of patients are excluded from standard endovascular repair. Hybrid techniques with open surgical supra-aortic extra-anatomical bypasses provide a suitable proximal landing zone. Simultaneous or staged thoracic endovascular stent grafting can then be safely performed. Usually, these hybrid treatments combine surgical debranching of one or more supraaortic vessels by transposition or supraaortic bypass, with endovascular stentgraft placement into the thoracic aorta to exclude the aneurysm. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: We discuss which patients are potential candidates for thoracic aortic hybrid repair and demonstrate how multidetector computed tomography (CT) with twodimensional (2D) multiplanar reformation (MPR) and three-dimensional (3D) rendering is relevant in preoperative planning and postoperative assessment. A selected subset of cases of thoracic aortic disease treated with hybrid techniques is presented, including successful outcomes and complications. Conclusion: Knowledge of endovascular techniques, including hybrid repair, of complex aortic diseases is crucial for radiologists to provide the referring clinician information to determine appropriate clinical care. MDCT, including vascular reformations, is the diagnostic test choice for treatment assessment.",

Background: Unfavorable anatomy of the proximal aortic neck of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common factor precluding patients from an endovascular treatment Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe option. The use of fenestrated or branched devices allows the extension of the sealing and fixation portions of the graft into a more stable aorta, while simultaneously maintaining branch vessel patency. Fenestrated and branched aortic endografts clearly reduces the surgical impact on the patient, compared to open and hybrid repair alternatives. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: We discuss which patients are potential candidates for fenestrated and/or branched stentgrafts and demonstrate how multidetector computed tomography (CT) with two-dimensional (2D) multiplanar reformation (MPR) and three-dimensional (3D) rendering is relevant in preoperative planning and postoperative assessment. A selected subset of cases of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) treated with fenestrated and/or branched stent-grafts is presented, including successful outcomes and complications. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment with fenestrated and/or branched stent-grafts is a new therapeutic option with encouraging results for patients considered unfit for conventional open repair or standard endovascular repair.

This work was supported by NIH SBIR Grant: 1R43DK079481-01Purpose: Doxorubicin has a toxicity which is not well known in chemoembolization application. We evaluated the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity of doxorubicin-loaded microspheres (DoxMS) by histology and DNA-microarray technique[Blomme, Toxicology Letters,  2009]. Material and Methods: Hepatic arteries of two pigs were embolized with 1 mL of DoxMS (25mg) or BlandMS. Histopathological effects were evaluated at 1W. RNAs were extracted from embolized areas (n=3/pig) and hybridized onto Agilent porcine microarrays. Genes showing significantly different expression (p<0.01) between two groups were listed and classified by biological process. Results: At 1W after embolization, DoxMS caused important tissue damages (vascular necrosis in 51% of embolized vessels, parenchymal necrosis in 38%), whereas BlandMS caused no tissue damage. At the necrosis margin, repair process started with inflammation humans, canine and rats was tested in vitro. The efficacy of TAL6003 to lyse a thrombus in vivo was tested in a beagle dog femoral artery thrombosis model. And the safety of TAL6003 with respect to intracerebral hemorrhage transformation was tested in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Results: TAL6003 lysed clots from humans, canines and rats with nearly identical kinetics. TAL6003 (1.25 mg/kg) and rtPA (0.5 mg/kg) treatment significantly reduced the size of an arterial thrombus in the dog arterial thrombosis model as opposed to vehicle treatment (thrombus wt.: 171\u00b120 mg 7\u00b15 mg, and 53\u00b110 mg, for vehicle, rtPA and TAL6003, respectively; p<0.01). TAL6003 (0.15, 0.5, 1.5 and 5 mg/ kg) infusion starting after 6 hours of MCAo in the SHR and immediately before reflow induced no increase in severity or frequency of hemorrhagic transformation compared to saline or vehicle. In contrast, rtPA (10 and 30 mg/kg) induced more extensive intracerebral hemorrhage. TAL6003-treated rats displayed improvement in behavior. Conclusion: These data suggest that TAL6003 is as efficacious as and safer than rtPA for ischemic stroke.

Material and Methods: EPC were evaluated in vitro as a source of autologous seeding for SIS endothelialization. EPC were isolated from whole blood of adult domestic sheep. In vitro cell adhesion and proliferation of ovine EPC on a porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) was compared to collagen I-coated tissue culture wells. Conditions for seeding SIS with ovine EPC were optimized with a concentration of 300,000 cells/cm 2 and incubation for 48 h in a minimal ovine serum media. Endothelialization was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining, DNA quantification, functional assays, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Immunofluorescent staining of actin on the SIS after seeding with these conditions revealed a confluent layer of EPC.

Material and Methods: 5 rabbits were used for this study. A tracheal traumatism model was created through a cervical approach by making an incision covering 25% of the tracheal circumference. A modified Taewoong Medical (Niti-S tracheobronchial Full Covered stent) stent was then deployed. A PTFE segment was used to modify both stent ends. The stent was deployed under fluoroscopic control, making sure that the tracheal lesion was covered by the mid part of the stent. Hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters including heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (TV), SpO 2 , CO 2 and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were registered prior to creating the traumatism (phase I), during lesion creation (phase II) and after stent deployment (phase III). Results: An increased HR and TV and decreased SpO 2 was seen in all animals during phase II. All these parameters returned to baseline values during phase III. During the 8 weeks of follow-up completed to date, no respiratory disorders, subcutaneous emphysema development or hyperplasic tissue growth inside the trachea have been seen. Conclusion: In this preliminary study, covered metallic stent deployment was useful in the management of tracheal traumatism in the absence of stent-induced obstructive hyperplasia. This approach could allow a more conservative therapy for tracheal trauma, albeit a longer follow-up time is needed.In the rodent model, does an additional hepatic artery ligation have any benefit for compensatory liver regeneration than portal vein ligation alone?G.S. Jeon1  , B.M. Lee 2 , S.Y. Chung 3 ; 1 Dept. of Radiology, Bundang CHA General Hospital, College of Medicine, Pochon CHA University, Sungnam-si, Korea, 2 Surgery, Inje University Seoul Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea, 3 Pathology, Aerospace medical center, Chungwon-Gun, Korea.Purpose: Preoperative embolization of ipsilateral portal vein has been performed in many centers expecting compensatory regeneration of remnant liver. Animal models of portal vein embolization were well established. Furthermore, additional hepatic artery embolization to portal vein embolization has been introduced in several animal experiments. We compared portal vein ligation (PVL) and additional hepatic artery ligation (HAL) in this study. Material and Methods: 20 rats underwent ligation of portal vein, influenced to medial and left lateral lobe. Each 5 of them was sacrificed at 24hr, 72hr, 120hr, and 168hr after operation. Portal veins of the other 20 rats were ligated and 48hr later, we tied up the hepatic artery supplied to medial and left lateral lobe, and sacrificed them at 24hr, 72hr, 120hr, and 168hr after. ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ALP, gamma GT, albumin, PT, INR were checked with blood sample.

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) was diagnosed if patients presented typical symptoms of AMI but lacked a history of CMI. Technical success was defined as patency of treated arteries with residual stenosis of 30% or less. 30-day mortality and morbidity (renal, liver, heart failure, heart attack, pneumonia/ARDS, SIRS/sepsis, stroke and death) were determined. Results: Stenting was carried out in 21, 11 and 14 patients with CMI, eCMI and AMI, respectively. Results of the eCMI-subgroup are as following: stenting was performed in nine patients primarily and in two secondarily after laparotomy. Technical success was achieved in twelve out of 14 arteries (86%). 30-day mortality was 27% (three of eleven patients) and morbidity 36% (four of eleven patients). Two patients died of cardiopulmonary failure and one of heart attack. Another patient suffered from pneumonia/ARDS postinterventionally. 30-day mortality of the CMI-and AMI-subgroup was 5% and 64%, respectively. Conclusion: Percutaneous stenting for the treatment of eCMI can be carried out with high technical success rate and was associated with acceptable mortality and morbidity in our study population.Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe placement of gastroduodenal stents were attempted in 64 patients (M:F, 44:20; mean age, 65.9 years) with malignant gastroduodenal obstructions. Stent types were classified as uncovered stent (Group I), partially covered stent (Group II) and covered stent (Group III). The technical and clinical success, complication rates and stent patency rates were evaluated and compared according to the stent types. The follow-up period was 1~760 days (mean, 61.8 \u00b1 96.1 days). Results: Radiologic stent placement was technically successful in 82 of 88 cases (93.2%). Clinical success rates were 90.3% in Group I (28/31), 91.4% in Group II (32/35) and 93.8% in Group III(15/16). During follow-up, total complication rates according to stent types were 25.8% (Group I), 31.4% (Group II) and 31.3% (Group III). The primary stent patency rates according to stent types (Group I/II/ There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical success rates, total complication rates and primary stent patency rates among the three stent types.Conclusion:The radiologic placement of gastroduodenal stents for the treatment of malignant gastroduodenal obstruction is feasible and safe and provides acceptable clinical results. Additional studies are desirable for the collection of more reliable data.Purpose: Severe postoperative intra-abdominal septic complications (IASC) such as an anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal abscess, and fistula are significantly associated with the presence of spontaneous intra-abdominal abscess at the time of laparotomy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of severe postoperative IASC in patients undergoing intestinal resections with and without preoperative percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD) before definitive surgery. Material and Methods: Using a prospective surgical database, we searched for patients with CD and spontaneous intra-abdominal abscesses who underwent intestinal resection at our hospital from May 2005 to February 2009. Postoperative IASC were defined as anastomotic leaks, abscess, and fistula within 1 month after surgery. We compared the incidence of postoperative IASC in patients with (group I) and without (group II) preoperative PAD (Fisher's exact test). Results: We identified 25 patients (15 men, 10 women; mean age, 31 years) with spontaneous intra-abdominal abscesses. PAD was performed in 12 of 25 patients (48%), with an average of 37 days before surgery (range, 6-83 days). The overall rate of postoperative IASC was 48% (12 of 25 patients). In group I, postoperative IASC occurred in 3 of 12 patients (25%). In group II, postoperative IASC were assessed in 9 of 13 patients (69%). The differences between these two groups were considered to be statistically significant (p = 0.04). Conclusion: PAD of intra-abdominal abscesses before surgery could significantly reduce the occurrence of severe postoperative IASC in patients with CD.of feed around the tube, abscess formation, gastric haemorrhage or perforation.

Learning objectives: To review the principles used to perform an evidence-based radiology review of available literature and to apply these principles to assess the benefits of primary percutaneous catheter drainage of acute necrotising pancreatitis over surgery, with regard to patient outcomes. Background: The incidence of pancreatitis in the United States is approximately 185,000 per year. Acute necrotising pancreatitis complicates roughly 20% of these patients. Traditionally management options were conservative treatment plus/minus open necrosectomy. Therapeutic strategies are evolving to involve percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage and minimally invasive surgery. Our goal was to appraise the available literature and assess whether or not primary percutaneous drainage decreases morbidity or mortality in this patient group. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Using the McMaster principles developed in Canada, we formulated a specific clinical question in the standardised patient-intervention-comparison-outcome (PICO) format. For the purpose of our clinical review the question was as follows: in patients with acute necrotising pancreatitis, does percutaneous drainage as a primary intervention reduce morbidity and mortality when compared with open necrosectomy? We proceeded to carry out a comprehensive literature search and appraisal of relevant articles found. Conclusion: While the majority of the evidence available is of a low level we did elucidate the following: roughly 1/3 of patients will require no further intervention after percutaneous catheter drainage. Percutaneous drainage in conjunction with minimally invasive techniques decreases major complications by up to 29%. No significant difference in the mortality rate.were re-treated within 48 hours because of bleeding relapse. In all 8 patients the second embolization obtained definitive treatment. Overall, 88 branches were embolized: 68/88 celiac-trunk branches (45/68 from GDA), 14/88 SMA branches, 6/88 IMA branches. The embolization material used was gelfoam/PVA (34/64 procedures), microcoils (20/64), gelfoam and microcoils (6/64), stentgraft (2/64), intentional dissection(2/64). No complication occurred during embolization or within 50 days of follow up. In 45/110 patients no active bleeding was demonstrated at IADSA. The survival rate of this group was comparable with the embolized group. Conclusion: Transcatheter embolization was effective in achieving hemostasis in acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients without active bleeding at IADSA benefit from medical treatment.Successful drainage and ethanol injection of multiple and very large hydatid liver cystsL.

Material and Methods: Between June 2004 and January 2011, 9 patients (6 males, 3 females; age range: 38 -78, median: 55) with 18 HLCs (diameter range: 6.0 -15.0 cm; mean: 8.5 cm) were admitted at our institution. 1 patient had 5 cysts, 4 patients 2 cysts and 5 patients 1 cyst. 13 cysts were unilocular (type 1-2), 5 cysts were septated or multivesiculated (type 3). 7 patients were treated percutaneously and 2 under laparotomy. Follow-up was performed by US every 3 months and abdominal-CT every 12 months. Results: No major complication was reported. At last US examination during the follow-up, 11/ 18 cysts (61.1%) showed a solid pattern (a hypo-or hyper-echoic solid mass) and 7 cysts (38.8%) showed a fluid-mixed pattern. A substantial shrinkage was observed in all cyst with decrease in size ranging from 30 to 80% of the pre-treatment volume. In no patient lung recurrence at chest X-ray or abdominal spreading of the disease at CT was reported. Conclusion: In our experience, \"open\" and \"percutaneous\" aspiration and ethanol injection of very large HLC can be safely performed and showed a high long-term efficacy.Is there a role for prophylactic gastroduodenal artery embolization in the management of patients with active upper GI haemorrhage?S.Dixon, V.

Fernandes; Interventional Radiology, Saint Louis Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal.Purpose: Evaluate the safety, morbidity and rate of spontaneous, successful and finished pregnancies following uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). Material and Methods: UFE performed in 1001 patients (112 wanted to conceive). None of the patients could get a successful pregnancy at the time of embolization. UFE was performed, by single femoral approach with a C 2 F 5 catheter and Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles 300m, 500m and 700m and Embozene microspheres 500m and 700m. Results: From the 112 patients who wanted to conceive, 59 (62.7%) had spontaneous pregnancies (age22-43 years, mean 36.2). Time between UFE and conception ranged 2-26 months (mean 10.7). There are 52 finished pregnancies with 44 successful life births (84.6%), 6 spontaneous abortions (11.5%), 1 induced abortion and 1 stillbirth at 36 weeks; 4 pre-term gestations (9.9%) that lasted 33 and 34 weeks in 2 patients and 36 weeks in 2 patients. The gestation of the remaining 40 women ranged 37-41 weeks (mean 38.2). There were 2 cases of placenta previa (4.5%), 5 low birth weights (11.4%). The weight of the remaining 39 newborns ranged 2.610 kg-4.900 kg (mean 3.088). There were 29 cesarean sections (65.9%) and 15 vaginal deliveries. All the babies born presented no significant neonatal problems. In the remaining 7 patients with ongoing pregnancies the evolution has been normal and are waiting for term. Conclusion: Spontaneous pregnancies after UFE are safe with low morbidity. There is high rate of spontaneous pregnancies (62.7%) and successful pregnancy with live birth (84.6%) after UFE.Radiological management of the complications of laparoscopic band surgeryS.E.Jacob, S.

Material and Methods: 115 consecutive patients underwent UAE between 07/2001 and 06/2004. Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed within 48-72h after UAE in all pts. Percentage of fibroid infarction was assessed on a scale from 0 to 100% (10% increments). Patients were divided into three groups according to infarction rate (I: 100%, n= 60; II: 90-99%, n=32; and III: 0-89%, n=23). Clinical outcome (change in menorrhagia and bulk symptoms and overall satisfaction) was documented. Frequency of re-interventions for treatment failure (surgery, repeat UAE) was assessed and compared using Kaplan-Meier-analysis (KMA) and associated Log-rank-test (LRT). 91%) in group II and 22/23 (96%) in group III. Only 55% of patients in group II had no re-intervention (p<0.001). KMA showed no significant difference in the cumulative rate of re-intervention between group I and II with a survival free from re-intervention of 93% in both groups. Patients without re-intervention improved with respect to menorrhagia (I: 88%; II: 100%, III: 80%) and bulk symptoms (I: 84%; II: 89%, III: 91%) and were satisfied with the results of treatment (I: 89%; II: 100%, III: 91%). Conclusion: Infarction rate of fibroids at early contrast-enhanced MRI after UAE is strongly associated with clinical outcome. Clinical failure with a high frequency of re-interventions occurring within 2 years after UAE is seen in patients with devascularization below 90% of fibroid load.Uterine artery embolization for large fibroids: a comparative study in patients with and without pretreatment gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonistsM.-D. Kim, J.Y. Won, D.Y. Lee, M.S. Lee, S.I. Park, M. Lee, K.H. Lee; Radiology, Research Institute of Radiological Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of pretreatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist before uterine artery embolization (UAE) for large fibroids. Material and Methods: A total of 40 patients with large fibroids (\u226510cm) diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were enrolled. The maximum diameter of the fibroids was 10.0-16.3 cm (mean, 11.9 cm). Among the 40 patients, 28 (control group) underwent UAE without pretreatment with GnRH agonists, and 12 (GnRH group) received a GnRH agonist (3.75 mg leuprolide acetate, administered subcutaneously once a month) 1-5 times (mean, 2.7 times) before UAE. The patients were assessed for the extent of volume reduction of fibroids after hormonal treatment in the GnRH group. In both groups, necrosis of large fibroids and fibroid volumes were assessed by MRI 3-months after UAE. The primary embolic agent was non-spherical polyvinyl alcohol. Results: Thirty-nine out of 40 patients (97.5%) showed complete necrosis of large fibroids after UAE. When GnRH agonists were administered before UAE, the average rate of fibroid volume reduction rate was 36.3% (range, 10.3-68.9%). Follow-up MRI performed 3 months after UAE showed a 58.2% (45.0-79.0%) volume reduction rate of predominant fibroids in the GnRH group, which wasTreatment of symptomatic high-flow female varicocele with balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous foam sclerotherapy (B-ORTFS) using sodium-tetradecyl-sulphate foamR.Gandini, M.

Material and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 12 patients (mean age:35.2 years; range: 23-46)  with pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) with atypical high-flow venous collaterals treated by B-ORTFS between June 2005 and May 2008 at our Department. PCS was diagnosed by physical and transvaginal color-Doppler US examination, while high-flow venous collaterals were detected at selective ovarian venography. B-ORTFD was performed by injection of 3% STS foam into the pelvic varices after balloon-occlusion of the major venous vessels to which high-flow venous collaterals were tributary. Follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months by physical and transvaginal color-Doppler US examination and by a questionnaire-based assessment of pain using a symptom severity score. Results: The procedure was technically successful in all patients (100%). After the injection of 3% STS foam, 3 (25.0%) patients presented a colic-like pain with spontaneous resolution after 5 minutes. During follow-up, no recurrences of PCS were detected. A significant improvement of symptoms (Student's t test, P<0.01) was observed in follow-up period. Conclusion: B-ORTFS of high-flow female varicocele using 3% STS foam is a safe and effective procedure that should be taken into consideration as an alternative to other endovascular and surgical options.",

Material and Methods: Fourteen consecutive patients (38-56y, mean 47.64y) with symptomatic pure adenomyosis (menorrhagia, pain) non-responding to conservative treatment underwent bilateral UAE using Embozene\u00ae microspheres 700 \u03bcm. The diagnosis of adenomyosis was based on MRI criteria: diffuse or focal broadening/ enlargement of the junctional zone on T2-WI (thickness >12mm) and punctate high intensity myometrial foci. The MR images obtained before and after UAE (1 st , 3 rd , 6 th and 12 th month) were evaluated for changes regarding uterine volume (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height \u00d7 0.523), as well as the percentage of reduction rate in uterine size. The latter was calculated as follows: [volumepre-UAE -volumepost-UAE]/volumepre-UAE] \u00d7 100 (%). Patients' clinical status was also evaluated at corresponding intervals. Results: All patients demonstrated clinical improvement at the scheduled follow-up period.

A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical success rate, complications, requirement of additional treatment, and mortality. Multiple covariates including demographic data, causes of PPH, mode of delivery, preembolization hemodynamic stability, blood transfusion, and embolization characteristics were included in multivariate analyses to determine predictive factors for major complication. Results: Uterine artery embolization was successful in 206 patients (90.4%). The major complications occurred in 26 patients (11.8%) including hemorrhagic complication (n=11), extremity paresthesia (n=9), pelvic abscess (n=3), post-embolization syndrome (n=2), and transfusion-related complication (n=1). Twenty-one patients were improved with conservative management within 3 months after the embolization. Three patients with pelvic abscess and one patient with subarachnoidal hemorrhage were successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and surgical evacuation, respectively. One patient died of ischemic multiorgan failure 9 days after the embolization. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors for major complications were hemodynamic instability before UAE (P<0.05, OR 3.655, 95% CI 1.038-12.870) and embolization of pelvic artery other than uterine artery (P<0.01, OR 1.556, 95% CI 1.134-2.136). Conclusion: Major complications after UAE for PPH are not uncommon but mostly resolved with conservative management. Hemodynamic instability and embolization of pelvic artery other than uterine artery are independently associated with major complication.",

Niola, G. de Magistris; Vascular and Interventional Radiology, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.Purpose: We investigated the role of MDCT in identifying active bleeding in polytrauma patients with pelvic vascular injuries with or without associated fractures of the pelvis. Material and Methods: 90 patients with blunt pelvic trauma and a drop in haematocrit underwent MDCT and angiography. Conventional radiography of the pelvis was performed at the admission followed by whole-body MDCT without and with contrast triphasic study to identify any injuries. MDCT images were transferred to a workstation to assess pelvic fractures, site of haematoma, active extravasation of contrast, vascular injuries and associated traumatic lesions. An aortogram was performed before selective and superselective catheterization of the hypogastric arteries and their branches for embolization. Results related to identify the source of bleeding at MDCT were compared with sites of bleeding or vascular injury identified by selective pelvic angiography. Results: MDCT allowed us to identify pelvic bleeding in 83\\\\90 patients. Injured arteries were identified on MDCT in 75\\\\90 cases. Angiography confirmed the site of bleeding detected on MDCT and identified a second arterial hemorrhage in one patient. There was no agreement between MDCT and angiography in one patient. MDCT showed a PPV of 100% in identifying the injured arteries. Conclusion: Arterial hemorrhage is a serious problem associated with pelvic fracture, and remains the leading cause of death. MDCT provides diagnostic information and it is able to identify pelvic bleeding. The presence of contrast extravasation indicates an injury of a specific artery. Urgent angiography and transcatheter embolization are effective methods for controlling arterial bleeding in pelvic injuries.Single dose gadobenate dimeglumine for comprehensive MR angiography of the lower limbs with dynamic calf, 3-station bolus chase and high resolution extended phase infra-inguinal imaging: initial experience & comparison to historical control blood pool contrast agent imagingA.I. Christie 1 , G. Roditi 2 , S. Chandramohan 1 ;1 Radiology, Gartnavel Hospital, Glasgow, United Kingdom, 2 Radiology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, United Kingdom.Purpose: Contrast-enhanced MRA is the modality of choice for assessing peripheral arterial disease. With developments in percutaneous angioplasty and open surgery to small crural vessels, there is increasing demand for high image quality, particularly in the run-off vessels. However, due to rapid distribution of conventional extracellular contrast from the arterial bed, there is an inherently narrow window for image acquisition. This can lead to \"venous contamination\". This problem has been largely overcome by blood pool contrast agents which have a prolonged intravascular halflife, most notably gadofosveset. This agent is no longer available in the European Union. The aim of this study was to adopt \"extended phase\" imaging using conventional gadobenate dimeglumine to achieve high-resolution images comparable to gadogosveset. Material and Methods: The imaging of 20 patients scanned with gadobenate was compared to a control group of 20 scanned with Purpose: To evaluate cerebral hemodynamic changes using DSC-MRI in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (MS+CCSVI+), compared with MS patients without CCSVI (MS+CCSVI-) and healthy subjects (controls). Material and Methods: From a series of MS patients enrolled by our institute and evaluated with color-Doppler-ultrasound (CDU) and phlebography, in order to establish the prevalence of CCSVI in MS we selected 42 patients: 32 satisfied the CDU criteria set by Zamboni et al. to diagnose CCSVI, 10 did not fall under those criteria. We evaluated a control group of 10 healthy subjects. Values of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated in the semioval center, periventricular, frontal and peritrigonal NAWM. The perfusion data obtained in each area of NAWM were compared between the three groups. Results: Decreased CBV was observed in MS+CCSVI+ patients in the semioval center (p<0.001), frontal (p=0.004) and peritrigonal NAWM (p=0.006), no differences were seen in the periventricular NAWM. MS+CCSVI+ patients showed reduction of CBF in all the NAWM (semioval center p<0.001; frontal p=0.01; peritrigonal p=0.008; periventricular p=0.008). Different MTT values were seen in the frontal NAWM (p=0.04), there were no differences in the remaining areas. Conclusion: MS+CCSVI+ patients show CBF and CBV anomalies at multiple levels in the NAWM, both with respect to controls and MS+CCSVI-. Despite these data seemed to be very interesting, further studies are needed on a larger study group.",

C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) is an emerging imaging technique that has gained interest in interventional oncology. While pre-clinical imaging systems exist, translation to clinical applications can best be accomplished using a clinical system. The short ventilation cycle of 1-2 seconds causes motion artifacts in the 3D images. This work shows improved 3D image quality (IQ) using motion-compensated reconstruction. Material and Methods: CBCT scans with 5, 10 or 20 seconds duration were acquired in 8 rabbit models (>1 year old, 3.8-4.2kg weight) with VX-2 liver tumors. The following steps are performed for motion compensation. 1) From the X-ray projections, a region of interest (ROI) containing the diaphragm is selected and a gradient filter is applied. 2) The diaphragm motion is estimated by cross-correlation analysis of the filtered ROIs and a caudo-cranial shift vector is derived. 3) Ribcage and diaphragm are semi-automatically segmented from a standard 3D reconstruction. A 3D motion vector is interpolated for every voxel by keeping the ribcage static and applying the detected motion to the diaphragm. 4) The motion-compensated reconstruction is obtained by applying the motion vector to every voxel during back-projection. Results: Compared to standard CBCT reconstructions, the motioncompensated images show increased sharpness of the diaphragm, fewer streak artifacts, and improved delineation of tumor boundaries. Conclusion: Motion compensation of the rabbit ventilation results in improved IQ and can enable use of clinical C-arm systems for preclinical imaging to facilitate translational imaging research.

Myojin, S. Kawada, T. Hara,  C. Ito, Y. Imai;   Diagnostic Radiology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.Purpose: Anomalous inferior vena cava (IVC) in young patients is a risk factor for the development of deep venous thrombosis and the detection of the anomalies is important to place an IVC filter. The objective of our study is to evaluate the prevalence of the anomalous IVC associated with horseshoe kidney on MDCT. Material and Methods: A total of 66 patients with horseshoe kidneys (Group A: 45 men, 21 women; mean age: 59.9 years) and 1,060 patients without horseshoe kidney (Group B: 530 men, 530 women; mean age: 63.1 years) were retrospectively evaluated for the prevalence and variation of anomalous IVC on contrast-enhanced MDCT. We used 16-or 64-MDCT scanner and reviewed axial CT images with 5 mm of reconstruction interval. The prevalence of anomalous IVC was compared for both groups using Chi-square test. Results: Total anomalous IVCs were identified in 12 patients (1.1 %). Anomalous IVCs were identified in five patients (7.6%) of Group A: one preisthmic IVC with retrocaval ureter, two double IVCs posterior to the horseshoe kidneys, one left IVC posterior to the horseshoe kidney and one IVC with azygos continuation. Anomalous IVCs were identified in seven patients (0.66%) on Group B: four double IVCs, two left IVC and one IVC with azygos continuation with polysplenia and heterotaxy syndrome. Group A had higher prevalence of anomalous IVC than Group B (P < 0.001). Conclusion: There was a significantly higher frequency of anomalous IVC in patients with horseshoe kidneys than in those without horseshoe kidney on MDCT. Anomalous IVC associated with horseshoe kidneys should be detected before vena caval intervention.Results: 10 pts (7m, age 71+/-10y) with AF received a LAA occluder system (Amplatzer, Golden Valley/MN, USA). 9/10 had a stroke, 1/10 a TIA.

Ferro;   Radiology, San Martino, University Hospital, Genoa, Italy.Learning objectives: Evaluate the differences in tolerability and diagnostic quality of DSA images produced by the injection of two different and differently concentrated iodate particles, with equal volumes, flows and acquisition techniques. Background: To evaluate the possibility of performing diagnostic imaging of the lower peripheral vascular district with DSA using a low iodine concentration contrast media, although maintaining an high diagnostic power and ensuring greater patient comfort. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: 96 diabetic arteriopathic patients with high creatinine values (median 1.6 mg/dl) were evaluated between November 2009 and December 2010 by lower limbs DSA. All patients had renal premedication. They were divided into two groups: in the first one (48 patients) Iomeprolo 250 mg/ml was used, and in the other one (48 patients) Iopamidol 370 mg/ml. Tolerability [pain before and after injection of contrast medium was evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)] and capability to produce diagnostic images for lower limbs DSA between the two iodate particles were evaluated.

Shaw;   Radiology, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom.Purpose: Dual energy CT permits the production of virtual unenhanced (VU) images from any phase of a CT examination where iodinated contrast medium has been administered. The purpose of this study was to examine the image quality achievable with VU images of the aorta and investigate whether they were sufficient to replace conventional unenhanced (CU) images. Material and Methods: VU, CU and arterial phase images were acquired using a Siemens 128 slice second generation dual source multi-detector CT machine. Paired regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn at multiple points within the thoracic and abdominal aorta and Hounsfield units measured. Subjective assessment of VU image noise, quality and acceptability was performed by 2 independent expert readers. Results: Between November 2009 and November 2010, 50 patients were examined. There was no significant difference in HU attenuation between the VU and CU images in the abdominal aorta (44.8 vs. 45.3 p=0.15); however, there was a significant difference in HU attenuation in the thoracic aorta (42.9 vs. 47.2 p<0.01). Subjective assessment showed that VU images of the abdominal aorta were an acceptable replacement for CU images in 88% of cases as compared to only 12% of cases in the thoracic aorta. There would have been a radiation dose reduction of 53% had the CU series not been performed. Conclusion: VU images of the abdominal, but not the thoracic, aorta are of sufficient diagnostic quality to replace the CU series. This could lead to a significant reduction in radiation dose.Magnetic resonance imaging for optimized implantation and long-term monitoring of patients receiving a left atrial appendage occluderA.-M.Sinha  1 , C.

Material and Methods: DDP-H and DSM mixing solution was administered followed by the injection of DSM alone via hepatic artery every 4 weeks. In phase I, cohorts of 3 patients received escalating dose of DDP-H (50, 65 and 80mg/m2), and RD was estimated during the first cycle. In the phase II, more RD patients were added to assess tumor response, toxicity, hepatic progression-free survival (H-PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 24 patients (male 16, female 8; mean age 63.0, range 45-79) were enrolled in this study. FOLFOX had previously been administered to all patients, irinotecan-containing regimen to 12 and bevacizumab and/or cetuximab to 14. During phase I (n=9), maximum tolerated dose was not reached and DDP-H 80 mg/ m2 was recommended for a phase II. Phase II enrolled 15 patients. The following Grade 3 toxicities were observed: thrombocytopenia 12.5%, aspartate transaminase elevation 33.3%, alanine transaminase elevation 12.5%, hyponatremia 8.3%, and cholecystitis 4.2%. The tumor response rate was 61.1%. The median H-PFS and OS were 8.8 months (95% CI; 4.06 to 13.5) and 15.5 months (95% CI; 5.61 to 25.3), respectively.

Material and Methods: A retrospective review of transplant recipients undergoing TIPS creation was performed over a 10-year period. We analyzed the following parameters: evolution of portosystemic gradient (PSG) after TIPS, primary patency rates, appearance of encephalopathy and survival rates. Results: Ten liver transplant recipients underwent TIPS creation. TIPS was created with uncovered stent (Wallstent). The indication for TIPS was refractory ascites (n=8), variceal bleeding (n=1) and veno-occlusive disease (n=1). Mean time from transplantation was 47.4 months (range, 3-144 months). The technical and clinical success rate was 100%. PSG decreased from 14.9 \u00b1 3.4 mm Hg to 6.8 \u00b1 2.6 mm Hg. No complications were observed during procedure. Encephalopathy developed in three patients (30%). During the follow-up (average: 29 months; range, 1-120 months), three episodes of TIPS dysfunction were observed, and were successfully treated by means of angioplasty (n=1), stent placement (n=1) and angioplasty and stent placement (n=1). The resultant primary patency rates at 3, 6 and 12 months were 100%, 85% and 64%, respectively. The",

Material and Methods: From April 2006 to April 2010, 105 patients with hypersplenism caused by cirrhotic portal hypertension were treated with PSE. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT or MRI was performed routinely in 60 patients before PSE as well as 1-3 months after PSE. PVT was detected in 10 patients on images after the procedures. After PVT was discovered, 4 patients received anticoagulant therapy immediately, and the other 6 patients did not receive therapy. Clinical data of 10 patients with PVT were analyzed retrospectively.Results: 3 of 4 patients who received anticoagulant therapy had complete or partial resolution of the thrombus, and one developed mild ascites without thrombus progression. Of the 6 patients who did not receive anticoagulant therapy, follow-up studies (6-48 months, mean 16.9 months) demonstrated partial calcification of embolus in 1, progression of thrombosis in 5. Among 5 patients with thrombus progression, two experienced hematemesis due to variceal hemorrhage, two developed cavernous transformation, extensive collateral flow, ascites and variceal progression, and the remaining patient had variceal progression with melena during the followup period. Conclusion: PVT is a severe complication of PSE. Early diagnosis and prompt anticoagulant therapy can reduce the development of complications of PVT.",

Erdo\u011fan 1 Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of detachable balloonassisted proximal splenic artery embolization in cases with large and tortuous arterial anatomy. Material and Methods: During two years, seven cases suffering from bleeding fundal varices (n=2), liver cirrhosis (n=3) and hyperplenism with pancytopenia (n=1), thalassemia intermedia with a giant spleen (n=1), orthotopic liver transplantation with high splenic flow (n=1) were embolized with detachable balloon-assisted technique. A 6 or 7 French introducer-guiding catheter was first inserted to splenic artery origin. A Goldbal 4 or 5 balloon was inflated with the assistance of Magic microcatheter and detached giving attention to pancreatic feeders. Embolization was completed with long (30-50 cm) three or four electrically detachable coils. Patients were followed up clinically and with multiphasic CT after one month and with color Doppler at the sixth month. Results: In all cases embolization was successfully achieved. No complications or pos tprocedure patient discomfort was experienced. During the follow-up, no recanalization, distal embolization or parenchymal necrosis was encountered. On clinical followup symptoms of patients improved and no bleeding episode developed in patients with varices. Platelet counts increased 2-3 folds from the baseline values in patients with pancytopenia. Conclusion: Endovascular proximal splenic artery embolization with detachable balloon-assisted technique seems feasible and effective. We suggest this approach for safe embolization in cases with high flow and tortuous arterial anatomy for preventing distal embolization and parenchymal necrosis. G. Ananthakrishnan, R.P. Yadavali, R.

At 3-month there was no opacification of the pseudoaneurysm and the ipogastric artery was patent.Purpose: To discuss the clinical application of DWI and CEUS on ischemic-type biliary lesions after orthotopic liver transplantation. Material and Methods: 14 cases with ischemic-type biliary lesions after liver transplantation on bases of PTC or ERCP examination, pathology or clinical follow-up data were selected. All of 14 cases underwent CEUS, DWI and MRCP examination. The perfusion of hilar bile duct was dynamically observed on CEUS. The enhancement of the hilar bile duct wall was qualitatively graded as higher, equal, lower, or none. And the bile ducts signal of graft was also observed on DWI. Statistics analysis was also done between CEUS and DWI. Results: The MRCP revealed 13 cases ITBL with the sensitivity of (92.3%, 13/14) . MRCP mainly shows absent or thin bile signal at the level of hilar bile duct or hilar bile duct and intrahepatic small ducts, irregular stenosis and dilation. There were 11 cases show lower or none enhancement of hilar bile duct (78.6%, 11/14) on CEUS. The incidences of hyperintensity of bile duct of graft on DWI were (78.6%, 11/14) , mainly located in hilar bile duct and intrahepatic small ducts (90.9%, 10/11). 3 cases showed higher or equal enhancement of hilar bile duct on CEUS and no hyperintensity of bile duct on DWI. There was no difference between the two examinations. Conclusion: MRCP is a first choice, reliable and non-invasive way in the diagnosis of ITBL after liver transplantation.

Due to its extension, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. Infantile hemangioma of the ileum was the final diagnosis.imaging correlation. It is therefore of critical importance that the vascular radiologist is able to quickly and confidently recognise the spectrum of gastrointestinal complications which may occur. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: We pictorially present a wide spectrum of gastrointestinal complications which may develop post-operatively following aortic aneurysm repair. Specific postoperative complications include bowel ischaemia, paraprosthetic fistulation, bowel obstruction, direct bowel injury, omental infarction, intra-abdominal sepsis, ileus and peptic ulceration. The salient imaging and clinical features are presented with illustrative cases to aid learning. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal complications following open aortic aneurysm repair are difficult to diagnose without imaging and are a cause of significant mortality and morbidity. It is important for the radiologist to be able to identify specific complications following aortic aneurysm repair which are presented with pictorial examples in this educational exhibit.",

MR and DSA imaging revealed multiple CNS cavernomas and atypically convoluted superficial veins.Purpose: Recent advancements in simulation science permit patient-specific rehearsal (PsR) of carotid artery stenting procedures (CAS) by incorporation of DICOM data into endovascular simulations. This study aimed to assess face, content validity and the subjective sense of utility of PsR by the interventionalist and operative team members. Material and Methods: All patients deemed candidates for CAS with suitable CT imagery were enrolled. All team members were involved in rehearsals conducted in the Laboratory, Simulated Operating Suite or Angiosuite environment immediately before the real case. Dexterity and qualitative metrics were recorded. Subjective questionnaires used a Likert scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Results: Of 16 patients, 3 were dropouts due to a technical problem, an inadequate CT scan and a patient no longer deemed a candidate for CAS. In 10/13 and 12/13 patients, respectively, endovascular material and fluoroscopy angles were identical. In 5/13 and 4/13 respectively, the simulator did not adequately predict cannulation difficulties of the stenotic internal/common carotid arteries. The realism (4/5) , utility to evaluate the case (4/5), increase of efficiency in tool use (4/5) , potential to increase communication (4/5) , confidence (4/5) and team performance (4/5) were all rated highly. Conclusion: PsR is rated highly for both face and content validity. Although certain biomechanical vessel properties seem to be replicated to a lesser degree, endovascular material use, access strategy and angiography imagery are effectively replicated. PsR constitutes a unique tool that may help tailor endovascular material choice for patients and enhance patient safety, procedural efficiency and clinical cost-effectiveness.",

Kichikawa 2 ; 1 Radiology and Interventional Neuroradiology, Ishinkai Yao General Hospital, Yao, Japan, 2 Radiology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan, 3 Neurosurgery, Ishinkai Yao General Hospital, Yao, Japan.Purpose: Our purpose is to investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance plaque imaging (MRPI) to predict the high risk lesion for ischemic complication during carotid artery stenting (CAS) using filter embolic protection device (EPD). Material and Methods: 108 carotid artery stenosis in 102 patients before CAS (90 males; mean age, 71.9 years) were evaluated by MRPI with black blood T1 weighted images. 45 were symptomatic with \u226550% stenosis and 63 were asymptomatic with \u226580% stenosis. All CAS procedures were performed using 2 types filter EPD and stent (Angioguard XP/Precise (A/P): 75, Filter wire EZ/Carotid Wallstent (F/W): 33) . Main plaque components were classified into unstable plaque (intraplaque hemorrhage and lipid-rich/necrotic core) and stable (fibrous tissue and dense calcification) from the signal pattern. Development of new ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was assessed within 48 hours after CAS. We made statistical assessment on the plaque classification and the number of new ischemic lesions. Results: All CAS procedures were successful. Ipsilateral new ischemic lesions were observed in 23 (32.4%) in A/P and in 5 (14.7%) in F/W. Ipsilateral multiple ischemic lesions (>10) were observed in 5 (6.7%) in A/P and in 1 (3.0%) in F/W. New ischemic lesions except multiple were all asymptomatic. In A/P, multiple ischemic lesions occurred significantly (P < 0.01) more frequently in patients with unstable plaque, but in F/W did not occur significantly. Conclusion: Presence of unstable carotid plaques showed a higher risk of ischemic complication of CAS with in A/P than stable plaques, but there were no significant in F/W.",

Simonetti; Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Molecular Imaging, Interventional Radiology and Radiation Therapy, Fondazione Policlinico di Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.Purpose: Primary target was to validate VH-IVUS as diagnostic tool for plaque characterization through in vivo characterization of carotid artery plaques by correlation to ex vivo histological specimen. Secondary target was to compare in vivo VH-IVUS with HR-MR imaging in terms of the diagnostic accuracy in identifying the different plaque components. Material and Methods: In ex-vivo study, data were acquired from 6 human carotid arteries explanted. The arteries were explanted from six male patients with a mean age of 72 \u00b1 9.64 years, with known history of cerebral ischemia, either transient ischemic attack or stroke. Sectional images obtained by introducing the IVUS catheter into the explanted artery were compared with digitalized histological images. Twelve patients (8 males, 4 females, mean age of 75 \u00b1 6.33 years), candidates for carotid artery stenting were included in in-vivo study. All histological and HR-MR images were converted to a digital format. Once digital images and number of pixels for each plaque component was obtained, the exact percentages of the four plaque components were determined. Results: Forty-two images were used for correlation between VH-IVUS and histology. Quantitative analysis of different plaque components revealed a good concordance (0.80) between the two methods (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92). Comparison between HR-MR and VH-IVUS was performed on 27 images. Concordance between the two methods resulted 0.76 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92). Conclusion: VH-IVUS results being an effective diagnostic method that could be used as a valid alternative to HR-MR in centers where this technique is unavailable or when we need an intra-procedural plaque monitoring.",

Tomiyama; Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of dual phase cone-beam CT during hepatic arteriography (CBCTHA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Material and Methods: 37 patients with unresectable HCC underwent dual phase CBCTHA (Xper CT: Allura Xper FD20, Philips Medical System) prior to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Three blinded observers independently reviewed and compared images of CBCTHA early phase alone and dual phase-CBCTHA (240mgI/ml, 30ml, 1.2ml/sec, scan delay 15 sec, 40 sec). The gold standard was defined as lipiodol accumulation on non-contrast CT within one week or tumor growth on dynamic CT within six months after TACE. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by the alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (AFROC) method (Az value). Sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPV) were analyzed with the paired t test. In addition to the analysis for overall tumors, subanalysis for two subgroups, tumors equal or smaller than 1cm and those larger than 1cm, was performed. Results: For tumors larger than 1cm, the mean Az value and sensitivity were significantly higher for dual phase than those for early 599 C RSE Two-year LPFS rates for CLM with \"0\", \"1-5mm\", \"6-10mm\", \"11-15mm\" minimal margin were 74%, 54%, 26% and 20% (p=0.011); site concordance rates were 21/21 (100%), 16/19 (84%), 1/4 (25%), 0/1 (0%), respectively (p<0.001). Defects with several points of small margins under 5 mm had median LPFS of 9 vs 19 months (P=0.030). Minimal margin (p=0.002) and tumor size (p=0.028) were the only significant variables. The risk of LTP decreased 46% for each 5mm increase in margin and increased by 22% for each 5mm increase in tumor size.Conclusion: There appears to be a direct effect of ablation margin on LPFS. Based on the 4-8 week post-RFA CT; defects covering the tumor with margins over 5mm in all directions were associated with best local tumor control.",

Kim Purpose: Few data exist on ablation zone volumes (AZvol) achieved in human liver following microwave ablation (MWA) at 2.45 GHz. Whilst a formal dosimetry study has not been performed, we have analysed AZvol achieved in the clinical setting by liver MWA at 2.45 GHz with correlation against ablation time (AT), total energy delivered (TED) and number of treatment stations (TS). We also compared AZvol achieved in cirrhotic versus non-cirrhotic livers and against tumour type. Material and Methods: 17 liver tumours were treated and AT, TED & TS were recorded prospectively. Post-procedural dual phase CT was performed at a mean of 17 (standard deviation (SD) +/-11.9)) days post-treatment. AZvol was calculated using drawn regions of interest and Siemens volume software. Results: Mean total AT was 562 seconds (SD +/-315.0). Mean TED was 98.1 kJ (SD +/-53.2). MWA was performed at 1 (n=9), 2 (n=5), 4 (n=2) and 5 (n=1) stations. Mean tumour diameter was 30mm (SD +/-18.5 Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that treatment strategy for OLT could change in the next future but it actually needs for a longer follow-up time.",

Solbiati Purpose: We report our preliminary experience with percutaneous US-guided interstitial laser ablation (EchoLaser X4, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) for metachronous cervical nodal metastases from papillary thyroid carcinoma following total thyroidectomy and central + laterocervical lymph node dissection. Material and Methods: Thirteen metastatic nodes (mean size 1.1 cm; range 0.7-2.1 cm) in 13 patients were treated. All cases were negative at 131I whole body scan, but had marked uptake at 18F-FDG PET and elevated serum levels of thyroglobulin (Tg). Under local anesthesia a 300 mm quartz fiberoptic guide was placed into the node through a 21G needle. Nodes were treated with one (8 cases) or two (5) fiber insertions, each one with 3 W power for 400 sec (total energy 1,200 joules). After withdrawing the fiber, contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) was performed. All cases were followed at 3 and 6 months with B-mode US, CEUS, 18F-FDG PET and assessment of serum levels of Tg. Results: Laser ablation was technically feasible and well tolerated in all patients, with no either immediate or late complications. In 12/13 (92.3%) cases complete ablation was achieved. In 1 case residual uptake at 18F-FDG PET with abnormal SUV was found. The treatment was repeated and subsequent normalization of all parameters was achieved. Conclusion: Despite the limited number of cases in our experience, percutaneous US-guided interstitial laser ablation seems to be an effective, low cost and safe therapeutic tool for the treatment of metachronous nodal metastases from papillary thyroid carcinoma in the neck. Purpose: Patients with hyperparathyroidism are usually treated surgically; however, ectopic retro-sternal parathyroid adenomas require major surgery. As well, functional residual tissue is a frequent issue. We report our initial experience with CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as an alternative treatment for mediastinal adenomas. Material and Methods: Three patients with primary hyperparathyroidism caused by solitary ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenoma were treated with RFA, to avoid a sternotomy. The diagnosis was confirmed by enhanced CT and sestamibi scan. The adenoma was located in the preaortic space in one and at the anterolateral space in the other two. The procedures were performed under general anaesthesia with CT guidance. In two patients, a multi-tine needle (LeVeen, Boston Scientific) was used and in the third case a single probe (Cool tip, Radionics) was used. The patients stayed in-hospital for 24 hrs and calcium levels were measured next day and at 1 month.",

Material and Methods: In 12 anesthetized and ventilated swine, 24 RFA procedures under CT guidance (one for each lung) were performed using a 15-gauge radiofrequency LeVeen probe with coaxial introducer and following an increasing thermo-ablation protocol complying with literature guidelines. For each pig, one lung was implanted with Bio-Seal and the other did not receive any closure device. Pre-and post-procedure CT were acquired to detect and quantify pneumothorax. Swines were sacrificed at day 2, month 1, month 3 and month 6 after RFA (4 groups of 3 swine), for pathological analysis. Results: In the Bio-Seal group, one 150 ml clinically significant pneumothorax appeared after needle withdrawal. In the control group, three clinically significant pneumothorax occurred after needle withdrawal. After Bio-Seal implantation, the relative risk reduction of acute pneumothorax occurring after needle withdrawal was 66.7% (p=0.309). Pathological analysis showed that the Bio-Seal was well adhesive to the wall of the needle pathway at day 2 and month 1. It started to resorb at 3 months, and was almost fully hydrolyzed at month 6, with only small residue still visible. The needle tract was well filled with a well delineated scar, occluded by fibromuscular processes, and no patent tract was still visible.",

Kim Purpose: There is a debate whether transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is more effective than RFA alone in the treatment of patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We therefore retrospectively compared these treatments in patients with HCCs of diameter 2-3 cm. Material and Methods: Outcomes, including tumor progression, survival rates and major complications, were compared in 83 patients (83 tumors) treated with combined TACE and RFA and in 231 patients (231 tumors) treated with RFA alone. Results: Median follow-up periods were similar in the TACE + RFA and RFA alone groups (37 vs. 38 months). During follow-up, local tumor progression was observed in 16% and 41% of tumors, respectively. The 1-, 3-and 5-year local tumor progression-free survival rates were significantly higher in the TACE + RFA group (95, 86 and 83%, respectively) than in the RFA-alone group (78, 61 and 53%, respectively; P < 0.001). The 1-, 3-and 5-year overall survival rates, however, were similar in the TACE + RFA (93, 72 and 63%, respectively) and RFA (93, 73 and 53%, respectively) groups (P = 0.545), as were the rates of major complications (1.2 vs. 0.4%). Conclusion: Combined TACE and RFA was safe and provided better local tumor control than RFA alone in the treatment of 2-to 3-cm sized HCCs, although survival rates were similar.",

Imai 1 Purpose: To evaluate the pathological efficacy of intra-arterial chemotherapy with radiotherapy for advanced pharyngeal cancers (stage IV). Material and Methods: Thirteen patients with advanced pharyngeal cancers (oropharynx 8 cases, hypopharynx 5 cases) received intra-arterial chemotherapy with radiotherapy between April 2009 and July 2010. All 13 cases were fresh cases and the pathological evaluation was performed at the end of neo adjuvant therapies (before surgical operations or surgical biopsies). Under the DSA with cone beam CT, CDDP or NDP (100-150 mg/m) was infused to the feeding vessels superselectively. Three to 6 injections were given every 2 weeks during a radiation period (60-80Gy). The pathological evaluation of primary cancers was performed by surgical operations (n=4) and surgical biopsies (n=9). The cervical node resections were done in 11 cases. Results: Of 13 primary pharyngeal cancers pathologically evaluated, 11 cases (84.6%) achieved a CR (complete remission) and 2 cases (15.4%) were PR (partial remission). On the other hand, in cervical node metastases, pathological CR rate was 46.2% and PR rate was 53.8%. Conclusion: Former studies by others evaluated the efficacy of superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy for head and neck cancers by medical imaging and clinical following up. In our study, we evaluated the pathological efficacy of this treatment and believe that this treatment seems to be the best therapy for advanced pharyngeal cancers. By the way, the pathological CR rate of this treatment for cervical node metastases was not satisfactory and cervical node resections are recommended for the condition.",

The amount of catecholamine in the adrenal gland was also measured. Material and Methods: During general anesthesia, laparotomy was performed to expose the bilateral adrenal gland. An arterial catheter was used for direct blood pressure measurements during the procedure. Then, a cryoprobe was introduced into the right or left adrenal gland and cryoablation was performed in four swine. The protocol of cryoablation consisted of five minutes freezing followed by 5 minute active thawing. Blood samples were collected immediately before and at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15 , and 20 minutes after the beginning of thawing in two swine. Plasma catecholamine and cortisol determinations were performed. In another swine, the adrenal gland was harvested and adrenal homogenate was centrifuged at 3000rpm for 15 min, then the supernatant fluid was used to measure the concentration of catecholamine. Results: In all four animals, hypertensive crisis with tachycardia and intense elevation of blood pressure was observed. Hypertensive crisis started about 4-5 minutes after the beginning of thawing. Plasma catecholamine began to increase just before the beginning of hypertensive crisis. The total amount of epinephrine in the normal adrenal gland was 1.0 mg. Conclusion: Cryoablation of normal adrenal gland induced hypertensive crisis by released catecholamine. The timing when hypertensive crisis occurred was about four minutes after the beginning of thawing. The adrenal gland contained enough amount of catecholamine to cause hypertensive crisis.Purpose: About half of patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer will develop metastatic disease and, however, in spite of the significant progress in the therapeutic strategies for metastatic disease, virtually all patients will eventually succumb to their illness.

Interventional radiology may be proposed (revised ATA guidelines; recommendation 63). Our aim is to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of lung radiofrequency ablation and cement injection. Material and Methods: During this retrospective study , twelve consecutive patients with lung metastases were treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Regular follow-up was done with CT-scanner and PET-CT. When more than 5 nodules were present, only hypermetabolic PET-CT nodules were treated. Endpoints were local efficacy based on imaging follow-up, decrease of thyroglobulin (Tg) and clinical outcome. Eleven consecutive patients with painful bone metastases were treated with cementoplasty. End points were pain relief, patient outcome and assessment of fracture prevention. Results: Lung RFA: 12 patients (mean 62.9 y), 23 nodules (mean 12.3 mm) were treated during 18 sessions. The main complication was a pneumothorax (67%). No local recurrence was noted with a median follow-up of 3.2 years. Tg decreased in all cases. 4 patients remain in complete remission. Cementoplasty: 11 patients (mean 61.3 y) were treated by cementoplasty. 10 vertebras, 2 long bones, 8 pelvic bones. In 20 sessions, 3 leakages occurred. Pain relief except for one was obtained; no fractures were depicted. Six patients are still alive (mean follow-up time 3.2 y), 6 with ECOG 0-1 performance status. Conclusion: Interventional radiology and mainly lung radiofrequency ablation and cementoplasty are very useful options for treating slowly evolving radioiodine refractory thyroid cancers.

It most commonly originates from lung. Our purpose is to compromise our initial experience in image-guided local tumor ablation of adrenal metastases, with microwave energy. Material and Methods: Over a 1-year period a total of 17 MWC sessions were performed in our hospital (15 patients). 9 of the patients were men and 6 were women, ranging in age between 51 and 80 years. They all had lung cancer. 8 of the adrenal tumors were located on the right and 9 on the left. The diameter of the tumors ranged between 3,8 and 5 cm. The whole procedure of MWC was performed percutaneously, under CT guidance and using local analgesic therapy. The microwave energy was applied for 3 to 5 min. A dual-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced CT was performed after the antenna removal to evaluate the immediate lesion's response to the ablation. Follow-up was performed at 1, 3, and 6 month's post-MWC and every 6 months afterwards. Results: 14/17 (82,3%) tumors showed complete response. 3/17 (17,6%) tumors showed partial necrosis and in those a second MWC was performed. 4/17 tumors showed a local recurrence and they also underwent a second session. Major complications did not occur. Conclusion: MWC of adrenal metastasis is a promising alternative treatment. However, more studies need to be conducted in order to prove its efficacy and establish its role as far as long-term survival is concerned.",

All examinations were interpreted blindly by two radiologists and afterwards CEUS findings were compared with MDCT by an experienced radiologist in abdominal imaging. MDCT was used as reference standard. Results: In 68 nodules a complete response was obtained in 60 nodules and incomplete response in the other 8. Percentage of complete response was 88,2%. Post-RFA CEUS was able to detect 7 of 8 cases with residual tumor. The results obtained with CEUS agreed with those obtained with MDCT in all cases, rendering a diagnostic accuracy of 100%. There was no statistically significant difference in overall diagnostic accuracy between MRI and MDCT in the evaluation of residual tumor (p > .05).

To inform atypical imaging findings that mimic complications and procedure-related appearance. Background: Recently, RFA has been one of therapeutic options for treatment of renal cell carcinoma. However, imaging findings after RFA has not been widely accepted, therefore accurate assessment of ablated tumor and around the tumor is essential for early detection of residual or recurrent tumor and management of complication. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: 1. Typical imaging finding after RFA a) tumor density on CT and signal intensity on MRI immediately after RFA, b) morphological change after RFA including renal halo sign, c) contrast enhancement with or without local progression, and d) utility of MRI, especially diffusion weighted imaging 2. Imaging findings of complications: a) Bleeding (subcapsular, perirenal or calyceal). b) ureteral injury, c) bowel injury, d) tumor seeding, and e) urine leak. 3. Imaging findings that mimic complications a) pneumoretroperitoneum and retroperitoneal fluid collection, b) wedge-shaped retention of contrast medium, and c) imaging after trans-hepatic and trans-pulmonary approach. Conclusion: The major teaching points of this exhibit are: 1. Tumor without local progression tends to shrink over time and lose contrast enhancement. On the other hand, those with local progression tends to show nodular or crescent enhancement or signal change in diffusion weighted imaging. 2. There are a variety of complications and its mimickers after RFA of renal cell carcinoma. Learning objectives: To describe the main indications and the technical steps to perform percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) image-guided procedures in benign lesions. To access procedure safety, effectiveness and clinical outcome. Background: With expertise and the ability to adjust them to the special needs of patients several image-guided RFA techniques can be made. Besides necrosis and according to the main principles of thermal ablation, heat production can be helpful in providing coagulating and sterilization effects in biological tissues. This exhibit reviews the indications and contraindications of the described techniques in benign lesions. All techniques were made under sedation and with appropriate electrodes. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Different procedures are described: RFA of symptomatic liver hemangiomas, RFA of lung aspergilomas, RFA of liver hydatid cysts and RFA of functioning adrenal adenomas.

Background: As blood flow promotes heat loss of tumors, its reduction or elimination during RFA increases the ablation volume. As RCCs are supplied almost exclusively by the renal arteries, effects of RFA can be enhanced after blockage of the renal arterial blood flow. Although CT-guided RFA after arterial embolization was reported as a feasible, safe, and promising treatment for unresectable RCCs, it required two interventional sessions, using a permanent embolic material to maintain prolonged arterial occlusion. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Ten patients with 12 RCCs who were ineligible for surgery underwent RFA. We first introduced gelatin sponge particles as a temporary embolic material for selective arterial embolization and then proceeded to RFA under realtime CT fluoroscopic guidance. Iodized oil was used as a marker at CT-guided puncture. RFA was technically successful in all patients and tumor enhancement was eliminated after 2 RFA sessions. There were no major post-RFA complications and no patient experienced local recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 24 months.

Background: Hepatic malignancies represent a leading cause of world-wide cancer-related mortality. Currently, multiple locoregional therapies are available for the treatment of these malignancies, including various embolic (e.g. chemo-, radio-and bland embolization) and ablative therapies. HCT is a novel percutaneous therapy designed to allow the delivery of high-dose chemotherapeutic agents (CTA) to the liver while simultaneously protecting extrahepatic structures from exposure. HCT using the PHP system is performed in three steps. The isolation step combines arterial seclusion of the liver with venous sequestration to functionally isolate the hepatic vasculature. The saturation step delivers high-dose CTA directly into the hepatic arterial circulation. The filtration step captures the hepatic venous outflow, and then prior to its return to the patient, it is cleansed via extracorporeal filters to remove toxic contaminants. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The basic technique of HCT will be described using illustrative cases drawn from our institutional involvement in the phase III melanoma study together with the published literature. Critical technical considerations for patient safety, as well as strategies for streamlining case efficiency will also be reviewed and illustrated using selective cases. Conclusion: HCT provides a novel technique for delivery of high dose CTA to the liver while minimizing systemic side effects. In the hands of an experienced interventional radiologist, this technique can be safely and efficiently performed. HCT is poised to become another key weapon in our arsenal for the treatment of hepatic malignancy.",

To precise the advantages, drawbacks and limitations of MR-guidance, over the \"traditional\" US-guidance.To give some tips on how to overcome difficulties and to avoid complications. Background: Currently, percutaneous cryoablation for localized prostate cancer is carried out under transrectal US-guidance. However, ice-ball visualization is impossible with US due to the posterior acoustic shadowing. MR-guidance has the major advantage of precise probe positioning and visualization of the ablation zone (iceball) as a signal void, along with capabilities of multi-planar high-resolution imaging. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Probes positioning is done using the transperineal approach and a free-hand technique under real-time TRUFI imaging. High-resolution T2 BLADE imaging, in at least two planes, is performed for verification of the proper position. A urethra double-lumen warming-catheter and a similar homemade rectal warming-balloon are used for protection of the urethra mucosa and rectal wall from thermal damage, respectively. Fiberoptic temperature sensors or non-invasive MR-temperature mapping are used for temperature monitoring. Real-time and highresolution BLADE multi-planar imaging is used for ice-ball monitoring. Two 10-min freezing cycles, separated by a 10-min passive thawing cycle, are performed systematically. Conclusion: MR-guided percutaneous prostate cryoablation is feasible and promising, with excellent monitoring of the ice-ball covering the gland. However, the free-hand probe positioning can be difficult and time-consuming. Further advances applied (use of a template and image fusion, as used in brachytherapy) can make the procedure easier and reproducible. Learning objectives: To describe the different techniques for thermal insulation during the thermal ablation procedures. To precise the best indications of each technique with rich illustrations, and to point out the significance of temperature monitoring. Background: Percutaneous image-guided thermal ablation techniques are widely used for therapeutic or palliative treatment of tumors (benign and malignant). Common areas treated include: kidney, liver, adrenal, and musculoskeletal tumors. The above procedures are relatively safe. One of the most common complications is the unintended thermal damage to nearby structures (i.e. GI-tract, neural structures). Sufficient coverage of the lesion along with thermal protection of the \"organs-at-risk\" is mandatory. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Different techniques of insulation can be used. Hydro-dissection offers thermal insulation and can also cool-down or warm-up tissue. Saline is not suitable for radiofrequency-ablation and D/W 5% should be advocated.",

            "text": "analyze the consequences and the complications induced by a nerve injury. We present recommendations and advices to avoid these complications. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Thermal injury of nerves during thermal ablation of lung tumors has previously been reported in the literature. Reported cases of phrenic nerve injury, brachial nerve injury, stellate ganglion injury have been published recently. Other potential nerve injuries exist: recurrent nerve, vagus nerve, etc. In order to avoid nerve damage, the interventional radiologist may need to analyze the anatomy of the treated region carefully, to monitor the temperature in the anatomic area of the nervous structure to protect, and to separate the nervous structure from the ablation zone as much as possible. Thanks to an artificial pneumothorax it is possible to avoid nerve injury. Conclusion: Nervous tissue is sensitive to heat and the degree of nerve damage depends both on the temperature level and on exposure duration. Before a thermal ablation, the interventional radiologist should be aware of the different thoracic nervous structures. Learning objectives: Techniques and tips for successful fluoroscopic colorectal stent placement in the management of malignant colonic obstruction. Background: The management of large bowel obstruction due to colonic malignancy has progressed since the introduction of stents. Self-expanding stent placement is a safe, effective procedure and can be used as a palliative measure or bridge to surgery. This presentation aims to educate the interventional radiologist regarding valuable tips and tricks leading to successful stent placement and outcome. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: In our institution, 60 patients have undergone fluoroscopic colorectal stent placement over a 42-month period with an 80% success rate. The complication rate was 8% including early stent migration and stent occlusion. Based on our experience, factors that influence successful deployment and outcome include: 1. multi-planar reconstruction of the pre-procedural CT scan to allow accurate identification and orientation of the stenosed lumen. This facilitates better positioning of the image intensifier to open out the lumen for effective guide wire passage. 2. Administration of pre-procedural steroids as an effective method of reducing inflammatory oedema around the stricture. 3. The use of a coaxial system to give extra stiffness to prevent catheter buckling. 4. The availability of a range of stent types for effective deployment in differing lesion morphology. 5. The recognition that annular strictures are easier to cross than polypoid lesions. If no contrast can be injected retrogradely the failure rate is high. 6. Lesions proximal to the splenic flexure may benefit from colonoscopic assistance. Conclusion: Good pre-procedural and intra-operative planning makes fluoroscopic colorectal stent placement a successful and safe procedure. Bilateral transdiscal computed tomography-guided splanchnic neurolysis performed to patient with pancreatic cancer T4N1M0 using 20 ml 10% phenol water solution.

Conclusion: Several thermal insulation and temperature monitoring techniques have been advocated in order to protect the \"organs at-risk\".

Manzi; Interventional Radiology Unit, Policlinico Abano Terme, Abano Terme, Italy.Learning objectives: To understand the anatomical and functional aspects of pedal circulation, and the role of angiographic imaging in planning and performing recanalization of distal tibial and foot arteries. Background: Infra-genicular atherosclerotic disease is the most common cause of critical limb ischemia (CLI), a condition manifested by rest pain, nonhealing ulcers and gangrene. In literature, recent data suggest that obtaining direct blood flow to the area of the ischemic lesions, usually located in the foot and toes of the affected limb, is an effective therapeutic option to heal the wounds and avoid major amputations. In recent years, with the introduction of new techniques and dedicated materials, the endovascular recanalization of pedal arteries has become a technically feasible procedure. Learning objectives: 1. To recognise important intra-and post-procedural complications arising from peripheral endovascular interventions. 2. To recognise risk factors for complications, and how to avoid them. 3. To understand management techniques. Background: Patients with peripheral vascular disease are often elderly with multiple co-morbidities and frequently present with acute medical conditions, such as critical limb ischaemia, requiring urgent interventions. Further, they often suffer from extensively diseased vessels, may be suboptimally cooperative with the procedure, and may have altered vascular anatomy from prior surgery or interventions. This combination understandably places them at increased risk for procedural complications. Recognising and managing these problems at an early stage is very important for a good outcome. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: We reviewed case records of our peripheral intervention cases over the last 5 years, and selected examples of important complications that the interventionist should be familiar with. These include access site complications, perforation, distal embolization, pseudoaneurysm, traumatic arterio-venous fistulas and dissections. We discuss the relevant imaging features of these conditions, and outline our management. We hope the reader will be able to benefit from these lessons learnt in hindsight.",

Material and Methods: A common protocol was used for the measurements of eye lens and extremity doses. 1140 measurements were performed in 40 European hospitals. The procedures monitored are: CA, PTCA, pacemaker implantations (PM), radiofrequency ablations, embolizations and angiographies (DSA) and angioplasties (PTA) of lower limbs (LL), renal arteries (Re), carotids (Ca) and brain (B). Results: For the IC procedures the highest doses in all anatomic sites were found for PM. For the IR procedures the highest values were recorded for embolizations and DSA/PTA LL procedures. The extremity annual dose limit was exceeded in a few cases for fingers and legs. According to the latest data on radiation-induced cataract, special attention should be given to the eye lens doses, as in 9% of the cases the 3/10 th of the actual annual limit was exceeded. For the effect of protective equipment, it was found that the ceiling and table shield can reduce the eye and leg doses up to 7 and 5 times, respectively. Conclusion: A series of recommendations were drawn from the ORAMED measurement campaign, the most important of which is the proper use of the protective equipment that can be achieved by proper training of the medical staff in radiation protection issues.",

Four aneurysms were treated with stent-graft and 2 aneurysms were treated with thrombin injection and embolization with coils under ultrasound guidance. The follow-up was performed with ECD and/or angio-CT after 1, 6 and 12 months, then annually. Purpose: There are no objective criteria for diagnosing splenic steal syndrome (SSS). The purpose of this study is to quantify hepatic arterial flow in liver transplant recipients with suspected SSS pre-and post-test balloon-occlusion of the splenic artery utilizing Doppler ultrasound (DUS) and quantitative digitally subtracted angiography (Q-DSA). A secondary aim is to correlate these two modalities. Material and Methods: Consecutive liver transplant recipients (01/2008-03/2010) were evaluated retrospectively. Suspected SSS cases were tested with DUS and Q-DSA pre-and post-balloon testocclusion of the splenic artery. Mean arterial velocity and flow were calculated from DUS. Q-DSA was performed on a prototype workstation (iFlow, Siemens). Regions of interest highlighting the splenic and hepatic parenchyma were drawn on pre-and post-splenic artery occlusion angiograms. Density measurements over time were recorded as a slope, peak density and time-density product (area under curve). These Q-DSA parameters were compared to arterial velocity and flow rate by DUS. Results: 5 suspected SSS (2.6% of transplants, N=5/193) were found. Four of the 5 underwent test-balloon occlusion with DUS and Q-DSA. By DUS, hepatic arterial velocity and blood flow increased by 1.6-1.8 and 1.7-2.6 folds, respectively. By Q-DSA, the hepatic arterial flow rate, total arterial flow, and peak contrast density increased by 1.1-12.8, 1.5-7.6, and 1.3-5.3, respectively. Conclusion: Splenic artery occlusion in liver transplants with SSS doubles the hepatic arterial flow (+1.7-2.6 folds) by DUS. Q-DSA parameters evaluated correlate qualitatively but not quantitatively but generally overestimate the increased hepatic arterial flow measured by DUS. Purpose: Therapy-essential hypertension is based on reducing sympathetic hyperactivity with drugs, but only in 65% satisfactory blood pressure levels were obtained. Some patients with \"uncontrolled hypertension\" take at least three antihypertensive drugs and yet have blood pressure >160/90 mmHg. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of percutaneous treatment with Ardian system in the treatment of patients with resistant essential hypertension. ",

Material and Methods: Over a period of 12 years, 14 patients (10 females:4 males) of age range 26-50 years (mean age 46) were diagnosed with IPDA aneurysms and celiac axis occlusion or stenosis on computed tomography (CT) and angiography. Outcome data were collected between 3 and 48 months (mean 24) and a literature search including the following key terms was conducted: celiac stenosis/occlusion, high flow aneurysm, IPDA aneurysm. Results: All patients presented with abdominal pain. Arcuate ligament compression was the cause of celiac stenosis in ten cases, local dissection with a history of abdominal trauma in three and atheroma in one. Eight patients were treated by aneurysm embolisation and celiac origin stenting, four by aneurysm embolisation alone, one by celiac bypass alone and one by celiac stenting plus laparoscopic division of the arcuate ligament. Follow-up CT or ultrasound demonstrated that all aneurysms remained excluded and all patients were well. The two aneurysms treated by celiac recanalisation alone spontaneously thrombosed within 9 months. The 42 case reports in the literature confirm the findings of this cohort. Conclusion: IPDA aneurysm secondary to celiac occlusive disease represents a distinct clinical syndrome. Treatment is necessary due to potential small size and is best achieved by a combination of surgery and/or stenting to the celiac axis and aneurysm embolisation when necessary. ",

The aim of this study was to present an innovative transhepatic approach for creating intrahepatic portosystemic shunts in the setting of these types of anatomic challenges, and to assess the feasibility and efficacy of this creative technique. Material and Methods: Eight patients accepted intrahepatic portosystemic shunts by innovative transhepatic approach. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the portal vein (PV) was punctured with a small Chiba needle. A 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the PV lumen. A 6-French sheath was inserted over the wire. Then, the hepatic vein or inferior vena cava was punctured with a 20-gauge, 20-cm Chiba needle through the sheath. Another 0.018-inch guidewire was advanced through the needle into the right internal jugular vein and then snared out of body. A 0.035-inch, 260-cm-long Glide-wire was then introduced through the transjugular sheath and manipulated into the MPV and then into the superior mesenteric vein after which the TIPS procedure is completed in the standard transjugular fashion.",

Indication of BRTO of gastric varices included iatrogenic complete portal vein thrombosis, complete portal vein thrombosis from pancreatitis and partial portal vein thrombosis from Crohn's disease. BRTO of gastric varices was performed in two patients due to prior significant hematemesis and in one patient for prophylaxis due to continuing anticoagulation medications. Technical and clinical success, and clinical outcome were analyzed. Results: BRTO of gastric varices was successfully performed in all patients without complications. Ethanolamine oleate was used as a sclerosing agent in one patient and 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate (sotradecol) in two patients. Follow-up CT or MRI images (2-9 months) and endoscopy showed obliteration of gastric varices in all patients.

Material and Methods: Between 1998 and 2010, OLT was performed in 74 pts with end-stage liver diseases (65) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (9) . Pre-OLT IR procedures included TIPS (10 pts) and TACE (6 pts). Post-OLT procedures were: dilatation or/and stenting of biliary strictures (7), stenting of IVC (4), balloon dilatation of cava-caval anastomosis (1), partial splenic embolization (PSE) in steel syndrome (1) . Results: All IR procedures were technically successful. There was no mortality or serious complication. There was partial tumor response in all 5 pts with HCC. Three successfully transplanted pts are alive without recurrence in 12-24 mo. After TIPS, 5 pts received OLT, 3 are on the waiting list, and 2 died of liver failure 5 and 7 mo later. Satisfactory drainage was achieved in all 7 pts with post-OLT biliary strictures. Clinical symptoms and liver function improved in all three pts with venous strictures. After PSE, steal syndrome regressed rapidly. All pts are asymptomatic and well in 5-40 mo after IR treatment.

Thrombosis was classified by location (portal trunk, right and left branches and mesenteric vein) and extent (100%, 50-99%, <50%). Indications for TIPS were variceal hemorrhage (n=12) and refractory ascites (n=5). Technical success was defined as an adequate graft placement and a portosystemic pressure gradient (PPG) lower than 12 mmHg after the procedure; clinical success as the improvement of the condition indicating TIPS; and TIPS dysfunction as a portosystemic pressure gradient higher than 12 mmHg or no permeability on imaging studies. Patient survival and shunt patency were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Mean time follow-up was 19 months. Death or absence of updated clinical data were the end points of the follow-up, which was performed by Doppler ultrasound (n=12), CT (n=8) and portography (n=4). Results: The technical and clinical success was 94% and 88%, respectively. Primary unassisted patency rates at 1, 6 and 12 months were 100% (n=17), 94% (n=15), and 86% (n=7), respectively.

Material and Methods: Herein, we retrospectively reviewed our single center data of ilio-femoaral vein obstruction recanalized using endovenous techniques -catheter-directed thromlysis and/or PTA w/o stents. The approaches of endovenous manipulation were analyzed, and the relative complications were recorded. The indications, advantages and disadvantages were analyzed. Results: From April 2000 to December 2010, a total of 196 ilio-femoral venous obstruction were recanalized using endovenous techniques in our center. In total, five approaches were applied in our cohort, and there was a learning curve of endovenous approach modification in our hands. In the beginning of our practice, common femoral vein cut-down was dominantly applied for insertion of sheath due to thrombi here, but bleeding and lymphatic leakage were commonly encountered due to systemic thrombolysis. Then we developed the second approach -exposure of great saphenous vein for sheath insertion, proved simple and safe, providing enough length for endovenous procedures, but still requiring a cut-down. For mini-invasiveness, in the last couple of years, we preferred puncture approaches, popliteal vein puncture is most common used, ankle great saphenous vein puncture is another choice, distal part carried out pre and post procedure, to calculate angiomatous/total volume fraction. Results: No intra-procedural major complications. Target temperature > 95 0 C achieved in all. Ablated areas have become less vascular and fattier. Soft tissue/tumour volume fraction has decreased from mean 0.26 (range 0.14-0.48) to 0.16 (0.04-0.34); p = 0.04. Mean follow-up period 3 years, no patient has had renal haemorrhage.

Background: Ureteric injuries are common following abdominal, pelvic or laparoscopic surgery and are often undiagnosed at the time of the operation. We present six cases of post-operative ureteric injuries in the form of a pictorial review, describing the aetology, presentation and outcome following radiological intervention. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: (Surgical procedure -presentation -diagnosis -management) Case 1: Laparoscopic laser diathermy -abdominal swelling -partial ureteric disruption and urinoma -percutaneous drainage of urinoma, nephrostomy and retrograde ureteric stent Case 2: Laparoscopic egg harvest -pelvic pain -partial ureteric disruption -nephrostomy and antegrade ureteric stent Case 3: Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy -loin pain -ligation of lower ureter -nephrostomy and antegrade ureteric stent Case 4: Vaginal hysterectomy -leaking urine per vagina -partial ureteric disruption and ureterovaginal fistula -nephrostomy and antegrade ureteric stent Case 5: Anterior-posterior resection -leaking urine per perineumcomplete ureteric transection and uretero-cutaneous fistula -nephrostomy and ureteric re-implantation Case 6: Laproscopic sacroplexy -loin pain -complete ureteric transection and urinoma -percutaneous drainage of urinoma, nephrostomy and ureteric re-implantation Conclusion: The role of intervention radiology in the management of iatrogenic ureteric injury includes reduction of urine leakage, drainage of urinoma and ureteric stenting to allow ureter to heal.

Pucik-Maisura; Radiology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America.Purpose: To determine the baseline retrieval rate of IVC filters at our institution and to see if this rate can be improved by instituting follow-up in all patients who received IVC filters. We established an IVC filter clinic and identified and contact all patients who have received retrievable inferior vena caval filters in the past 6 months to determine if retrieval is indicated. Material and Methods: Electronic medical record search was done to: determine baseline retrieval rate, identify all patients who have received retrievable inferior vena caval filters between August 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009 . Patients and/or referring physicians were contacted and clinical charts were reviewed. Relevant patients were seen in clinic and undergo filter retrieval if indicated. Attending physicians, fellows, technologists, and nursing participated in follow-up . Results: Prior to intervention, 16% (13/82) of filters were removed (baseline retrieval rate). We were able to obtain follow-up on an additional 61 patients. 46 were not candidates for filter retrieval for a variety of reasons, including inability to anticoagulate. 15 (18%) additional patients were contacted for filter removal that otherwise would have not been seen.femoral vein puncture is sometimes used. Conclusion: Recanalization of obstructed ilio-femoral vein is of great significance for symptomatic patients. From cut-down to puncture, from upper location puncture to lower location puncture, there were at least five approaches can be selected for endovenous therapy. The approach should be selected individually. We nowadays prefer popliteal vein puncture for most cases, ankle great saphenous puncture is also one of our preferences.",

We investigated in our study the usefulness of IVUS to detect CCSVI anomalies. (age range 19 to 56 years) with unilateral or bilateral great saphenous vein insufficiency with no other truncal vein insufficiency had laser ablation of the great saphenous vein. We performed US-guided femoral nerve block to provide anesthesia for the procedure. Fifteen mL of 1% lidocaine was administered around each femoral nerve under US guidance. Tumescent anesthesia was applied under US-guidance to every patient after the femoral block. However, tumescent anesthesia did not contain local anesthetic. Pinprick test was performed at 7 levels along the great saphenous vein after femoral nerve block 5, 10 and 20 minutes after the block and the pain levels were measured. A patient satisfaction score was filled after the procedure by each patient. Results: US-guided femoral nerve block caused anesthesia of all levels along the great saphenous vein except the first level at the groin (saphenofemoral junction region or level 1) and the ankle area (level 7). Seven patients required additional intravenous sedation in addition to femoral nerve block. Patient satisfaction was excellent after the procedure. Conclusion: US-guided femoral nerve block could be a very good alternative to other methods of anesthesia for endovenous laser treatment of the great saphenous vein insufficiency. The method was simple, easy to perform and obtained very good results. Anesthesia at the groin and ankle points was sometimes insufficient.",

The purpose of our study was to investigate the value of perivenous injection of tumescent solution to increase the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (US-GFS) for large varicose veins. Material and Methods: During a 28-month period, tumescent-augmented sclerotherapy (TAS) was performed in 90 legs of 61 patients for large (1-3 cm) varicosities due to saphenous or perforating vein insufficiency. In all patients, after the incompetent saphenous or perforating veins were ablated with endovenous laser, multiple butterfly needles or IV cannulas were placed into the large varicosities. Then, these veins were collapsed by US-guided perivenous tumescent injection and the US-GFS was then performed using a 1-3% polidocanol foam. Patients were followed up clinically and with color Doppler ultrasound at 1, 6 and 12 months. Results: TAS was technically successful in all patients. Complications included mild hyperpigmentation (n = 42) and skin necrosis (n = 1). Superficial thrombophlebitis did not occur. Postoperative pain and tenderness were minimal in all patients. During the follow-up, recanalization was seen in three legs with very large (2-3 cm) varicosities, due to recurrent truncal vein reflux, which was successfully treated with US-GFS.",

Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Dynamic contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) with multi-planner and 3D reconstruction can be useful to clarify the adrenal venous anatomy and to achieve selective catheterization. Special 3D reverse-shaped catheters are useful for achieving rapid and stable catheterization; moreover, side-hole microcatheters are useful for draining sufficient amount of venous blood. In some cases, super-selective blood sampling from the adrenal vein branch is possible with the microcatheter. The most common minor complication associated with adrenal venous catheterization is extravasation. This complication can be avoided by gentle maneuver and low-pressure contrast injection. Conclusion: Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT is mandatory for performing AVS. The use of special 3D reverse-shaped catheters and side-hole microcatheters is advisable for draining sufficient amount of blood from a precise venous branch.",

Tract embolization was infrequently used (7%). Diagnostic yield was obtained in 593 biopsies (99%) from an average 2.4 cores in patients with diffuse disease (91%) and 6.5 cores in focal disease (9%). Nine patients (1.5%) experienced a major complication including pneumothorax (n=1), abdominal wall pseudoaneurysm (n=1) and symptomatic bleeding (n=7).

Thanos; Computed Tomography and Interventional Radiology, SOTIRIA Hospital, Athens, Greece.Purpose: To present our experience in the treatment of pericardial effusions using both the trocar and the Seldinger techniques under CT guidance and prove their efficacy. Material and Methods: Over a 2-year period, 47 drainages were performed under CT-guidance on 47 patients (mean age 60 years, age range 45-85, 30 females, 17 males) suffering from symptomatic pericardial effusion. The inclusion criterion was an echocardiographically or CT-proved pericardial effusion. Six patients (12.7%) had small effusions (<100 ml), thirty-one (65,9%) had moderate-sized effusions (100 to 500 ml) and ten (21.2%) had large effusions (>500 ml). Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was used in patients with small effusions for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. Twenty patients (42.5%) with moderate-sized effusions were treated with the placement of an 8F pigtail catheter, using the trocar technique. The rest of the patients (ten-44.6%) underwent pericardiocentesis using the Seldinger technique. Effusions were completely aspirated, by hand or by gravity. Results: All the procedures were performed successfully. No major complications occurred. We observed pneumothorax in two patients (4%) that required no specific interventions, except monitoring and appropriate follow-up. Both CT-guided methods, simple trocar technique and Seldinger-technique, were equally effective. Conclusion: CT-guided pericardiocentesis using trocar and Seldinger techniques are equally safe and effective alternatives in patients with clinically significant pericardial effusion, which cannot be treated surgically or under ultrasound guidance.",

Material and Methods: Fourteen thyroid centers, members of Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology, were enrolled in this study. They completed a questionnaire regarding number and types of major and minor complications related to procedure. We evaluated various factors related to complications based on patients and treatment sessions. From June 2002 to September 2009, we treated 1533 nodules of 1449 patients (mean age 41.6 years, range 9-81) with benign thyroid nodules who had cosmetic or symptomatic problems. Cool-Tip RF System and internally cooled electrode with 1, 1.5 and 2 cm active tip were used. Results: The prevalence of complication was 3.3% (48 complications). The major complications were voice changes (n=14), brachial plexus injury (n=1), tumor rupture (n=3), abscess formation (n=1) and permanent hypothyroidism (n=2). The minor complications were hematoma (n=15), skin burn (n=4) and vomiting (n=9). All patients recovered spontaneously except for those with permanent hypothyroidism (n=2); follow-up loss (n=2) and surgery (n=1). The size of the nodules ranged from 2 to 20 cm and total treatment sessions were 2184. Mean radiofrequency energy delivered was 55.9 W and the mean procedure time was 13.7 min. Most complications were detected within 2 days and only five cases were reported 30 days after treatment. Complications reported were significantly higher in the first session (p=0.031) and in early follow-up periods (p<0.01). Nodule size, radiofrequency energy and treatment sessions showed no significance. Conclusion: RF ablation is a relatively low-risk procedure for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules. performed. The integrity of the cyst was evaluated under fluoroscopy by injecting 100-150ml contrast, mixed with local anesthetic 24 hours later. Subsequently, two injections and re-absorptions of the same quantity (100-150ml) of hypertonic NaCl 15% solution followed by three-time repetition of the same procedure with the addition of bleomycin were performed and the catheter was removed. All patients were hospitalized for additional 12 hours and underwent imaging follow up three and six months after the procedure. Results: Total regression of the lesion observed in 19 patients (82,6%) at the three-month follow-up. The remaining four patients had a minimal cystic remnant, with a content less than 10ml, which was not changed at the six-month examination. No immediate or dilated complications were noted, especially regarding episodes of sclerosing cholangitis, haemorrhage, interstitial fibrosis or skin hyperpigmentation. Conclusion: Percutaneous hypertonic NaCl and bleomycin sclerotherapy, seems to be a successful and safe procedure for the treatment of symptomatic simple cysts or seromas.",

After examination of the three-dimensional anatomical relationships among the targeted lesion and the other organs prior to puncture, an 18-gauge puncture needle was advanced to the targeted lesion with US-CT fusion image-guidance, then a catheter was placed by the Seldinger technique with fluoroscopic guidance. We evaluated the usefulness with the aim of assessing whether this technique enabled us to achieve precise catheter placement and avoid critical organ injury. Results: We treated 19 lesions of 18 patients. All drainage catheters were successfully placed into the targeted lesions. The median puncture route length was 4.6 cm (2.0-10.5 cm) on US image. Realtime US-CT fusion image provided objective anatomical visualization, made the targeted lesion more easily detectable, and showed the critical organs which were not clearly depicted on US images. There was no significant complication. Conclusion: Percutaneous drainage with real-time US-CT fusion image guidance is a useful technique. It provides more objective anatomical information as an adjunct to conventional US images and makes the treatment procedures safer.",

In all target lesions, we recorded the time until a two-fold roll-off was accomplished without repositioning the needle tip. RFA was performed using a monopolar LeVeen electrode system with an array diameter of 3.5 mm. Results: In group 1, the average ablation time until reaching a twofold roll-off was 10.3 min (4.5 -14.5 min) . In the control group, the ablation time averaged 27.4 min (17 -51 min) . Conclusion: Our initial observations indicate that transarterial chemoembolization performed within 1 day prior to RFA may lead to a significant decrease (p-value = 0.01 by Mann-Whitney-U) in tumor ablation times.",

Sclerosant was made of 3% Trombojet TM , room air, and contrast media, with a ratio of 1:2:1. Sclerotherapy using Trombojet TM is effective for the treatment of gastric fundal varices during BRTO.interventional radiologists are increasingly responsible for the treatment of such abscesses. Moreover, liver abscesses can result from interventional hepatic procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation and transarterial embolization. With a growing role as the provider in abscess drainage and the treatment of hepatic neoplasms, interventional radiologists should be aware of the incidence, risk factors, imaging characteristics, and management of liver abscesses. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: This poster will review liver abscess frequency and risk factors for assessing patients referred to the interventional radiology department for drainage and for those that emerge as a complication from interventional procedures, discuss the imaging characteristics of liver abscesses, and provide an approach to their drainage. Conclusion: 1. Rates of liver abscess formation vary based on interventional procedure, and are typically seen with a much higher rate in individuals with bilioenteric anastamosis/biliary stent/sphincterotomy. 2. Imaging modalities are equivalent in the sensitivity of liver abscess detection, but characteristic signs on CT and MRI may help guide management. 3. Although difficult to differentiate between the two etiologies, pyogenic abscesses should be treated with antibiotics plus percutaneous needle aspiration if less than 5cm or drainage if greater than 5cm, whereas amebic abscesses should be treated with antibiotics alone except in refractory cases. Learning objectives: Orbital venous and lymphatic malformations are rare congenital lesions requiring a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Percutaneous foam sclerotherapy treatment under digital subtraction angiography guidance is safe and effective. Intraocular pressure should be monitored post-procedure. Timely intervention by lateral canthotomy can save eyesight. Background: This retrospective review evaluated the orbital venous and lymphatic malformations treated at our institution with percutaneous sclerotherapy. The clinical features, radiology findings, treatment details and short-term outcomes are described. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: Three males and three females aged between 2 and 26 years were treated at our institution comprising five venous and one lymphatic malformations in the orbital region. The technique of sclerotherapy as well as the sclerosant preparation is described. Sclerotherapy was done in the presence of an ophthalmologist who measured the intraorbital pressure at regular intervals both during and after the procedure. Four patients required lateral cathotomy due to markedly raised intraorbital pressure. All patients were kept on follow up and showed significant resolution of symptoms and signs after the procedure. Conclusion: Orbital venous and lymphatic malformations are rare lesions which should be treated using a multidisciplinary approach. Percutaneous sclerotherapy with sodium tetradecyl sulfate foam using digital subtraction angiography guidance is a safe and effective method of treatment. Constant monitoring of the intraorbital pressure is required both during and after the procedure to decide about the need for lateral canthotomy to reduce the transiently increased intraorbital pressure.",
