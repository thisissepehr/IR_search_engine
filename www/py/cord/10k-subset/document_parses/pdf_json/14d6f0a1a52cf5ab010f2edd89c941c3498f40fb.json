            "text": "Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to show that 2009 H1N1 \"swine\" influenza pandemic vaccination policies deviated from predictions established in the theory of political survival, and to propose that pandemic response deviated because it was ruled by bureaucratized experts rather than by elected politicians. Design/methodology/approach -Focussing on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the paper employs descriptive statistical analysis of vaccination policies in nine western democracies. To probe the plausibility of the novel explanation, it uses quantitative and qualitative content analyses of media attention and coverage in two deviant cases, the USA and Denmark. Findings -Theories linking political survival to disaster responses find little empirical support in the substantial cross-country variations of vaccination responses during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Rather than following a political logic, the case studies of media coverage in the USA and Denmark demonstrate that the response was bureaucratized in the public health agencies (CDC and DMHA, respectively). Hence, while natural disaster responses appear to follow a political logic, the response to pandemics appears to be more strongly instituted in the hands of bureaucratic experts. Research limitations/implications -There is an added value of encompassing bureaucratic dynamics in political theories of disaster response; bureaucratized expertise proved to constitute a strong plausible explanation of the 2009 pandemic vaccination response. Practical implications -Pandemic preparedness and response depends critically on understanding the lessons of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic; a key lesson supported by this paper is that expert-based agencies rather than political leaders are the pivotal actors. Originality/value -This paper is the first to pinpoint the limitations of political survival theories of disaster responses with respect to the 2009 pandemic. Further, it is among the few to analyze the causes of variations in cross-country pandemic vaccination policies during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

This is important because the source of leadership has critical implications for pandemic vaccination policies. In contrast to other disasters, where the logic of political survival usually incites executives to choose a politically precautionary response strategy, public health agencies follow their expert judgments and practice in opting for pandemic responses that could either follow a precautionary or a proportional strategy. Hence, national pandemic responses such as vaccine purchases and distribution become highly divergent, depending upon which strategy health authorities use.",

The electorates tend to be retrospective when casting their votes and they might therefore punish governments that have not appeared to do their utmost to mitigate the adverse consequences of disasters in the preceding election period (Downs, 1957; Key, 1966; Fiorina, 1981) . Government responsiveness in times of crisis is thus not necessarily linked to benevolence but to the fact that governments -fighting for survival (re-election) -will go to great lengths to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. A free and active media improves conditions for retrospection by performing two basic functions: one as a mediator of information and one as a watchdog scrutinizing the government's disaster management (Sen, 1999; Besley and Burgess, 2002) . The existence of vibrant opposition parties is also important because they present voters with a credible ruling alternative; they might even be able to overturn the government directly though parliamentary procedures (a vote of no-confidence, for instance); and they will generally be highly critical of the government's handling of the disaster. Hence, the opposition, the electorate and the media form a trinity responsible for the political dynamic that spurs the government to respond to disasters (Diamond, 2008; Boin et al., 2005) .",

The comparative approach is based on a most-similar case design where different crisis responses take place in otherwise similar socio-political contexts (Przeworski and Teune, 1970; Landmann, 2008 ). The countries have been purposely selected to constitute a group of critical cases (Eckstein, 1975; George and Bennett, 2005) that have strategic importance: if the political theory of survival fails to predict government responses under the most optimal of conditions (mature and rich democracies), then the same is likely to also hold true in countries with less favorable conditions where centralism, patronage, corruption and red tape are prevalent. In these countries politicians could be capable of both ignoring their popularity among voters as well as any advice from the independent (external or internal) expert agencies. The data on vaccine purchases and coverage (uptake) are presented in Table I. The first two columns in Table I can be used to assess the first prediction. The table reveals that there were huge variations in both purchased vaccination coverage (government orders of vaccine courses) and actual coverage (uptake by the population of vaccination).

The outputs of national public health agencies are primarily developed by physicians with public health training and experience and by biomedical research scientists. These professions have established records as forces in health policy processes. Physicians' organizations are notoriously powerful (Friedson, 1970; Immergut, 1992; Lewis, 2005) . Government agencies that build on biomedical scientific expertise have considerable autonomous authority (Carpenter, 2001 (Carpenter, , 2010 Maor, 2011) . As the loci of powerful professions, public health agencies are thus likely to enjoy substantial deference from government executives and departments. In their roles as experts of disease outbreak control, the agencies are likely to be called on to guide and publicly legitimate their governments' pandemic responses. Each agency is thus likely in practice to decide within its own bureaucratic expert ranks what the \"best\" course of pandemic vaccination is for a whole nation. This autonomy includes being able to ignore vaccination policies in other countries.",

In contrast, \"proportional\" responses are associated with expert judgment that privileges isolation by calling on vulnerable individuals to protect themselves or infected individuals to stay clear of healthy ones.

According to our hypothesis this is because pandemic responses -unlike other disaster responses -are bureaucratized (and hence depoliticized) in powerful expert agencies. Quantitative and qualitative content analyses of media coverage in these two countries are used to assess public perceptions of responsibility and legitimacy in the pandemic response. They show that public attention overwhelmingly centered on the respective national public health agencies rather than on the national health departments or executives.

Else Smith was referenced in 14 percent of the stories while the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health were mentioned in only 0.5 percent. Hence, the quantitative data on media coverage and pressure strongly support the hypothesis of a decoupling in the general public's perception between the pandemic response and the government leadership. Qualitative analysis of the media story contents in the same period provides additional evidence in support of the hypothesis. While the Danish pandemic response was indeed subject to some criticism and contrasted to the more comprehensive response in Sweden, the criticism was directed solely at the DHMA. Furthermore, the criticism originated neither from the opposition nor the media but was to a large extent reduced to technocratic disagreements between DHMA and health experts from other institutions such as the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (Politiken, 2009; Berlingske, 2009a) , a Danish University professor in health economics (Politiken, 2009) and the chairman of the Danish association of local government doctors (BT, 2009) . Only one Member of Parliament publicly questioned the vaccination strategy of not providing universal coverage (Politiken, 2009) , and again the critique was targeted at the DHMA.",

US healthcare providers and the general public look to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta rather than to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) or to the Presidency for guidance and information on an emerging disease. Since its successful handling of polio using mass vaccination in the 1950s, the CDC has been the center of epidemic (and pandemic) response (Etheridge, 1992) . To an extent, the executive branch has been particularly discredited as a leader of responses to epidemic influenza due to past mismanagement (Neustadt and Fineberg, 1978) . Hence, history suggests that public health emergencies are bureaucratized rather than politicized in the USA. As in Scandinavia, this stands in stark contrast to other disasters, such as the hurricane flooding of New Orleans in 2005 (Katrina), where peak-level, executive (presidential and/or departmental) leadership has been the focus for public guidance and attention (Gerber and Cohen, 2008; Preston, 2008) .",

Directly strengthening expert communities in countries with weak democratic institutions (e.g. through agency support and training) could boost the likelihood of a more scientific response to pandemics. This could be preferable to a political response void of well-functioning mechanisms for accountability to the populace.
