Clinical assessment tools have poor sensitivity for predicting clinical outcomes. Molecular measurements of bacterial load correlate closely with clinical outcome but require specialist facilities and expertise. This study describes how routine blood culture testing can estimate bacterial load and predict clinical outcome for invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. Between December 2009 to March 2014, clinical and laboratory data were collected for 50 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteraemia secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. Fluorescence rates (FR) were calculated from growth curves generated by BACTEC blood culture analysers by dividing change in fluorescence units (FU), measured at the first point of detectable fluorescence and at the point of automated BACTEC positivity, by time in hours. The mean age of the patients was 70.6 years (49.6-86.3). Forty patients survived invasive pneumococcal disease and ten patients died. These two groups did not significantly differ by demographic or clinical characteristics. The mean FR for the nonsurvival group (3.62\u00d710 \u22123 FU/h) was significantly higher (p<0.001) than that of the survival group (1.73\u00d710 \u22123 FU/h). FR did not vary by serotype. We determined that an FR of 2.59 \u00d7 10 \u22123 FU/h might represent a useful threshold for predicting high mortality risk with a sensitivity of 91 % and a specificity of 97 %. Our FR calculation uses cheap and accessible routine blood culture techniques to predict mortality in a small retrospective cohort study.

Bacteraemia secondary to pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common presentation of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and is associated with high mortality rates, particularly in elderly populations [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Mortality rates are highest during the first days of admission [8, 9] . During this critical period, precise diagnostic evaluation, combination antibiotic therapy [10, 11] , adjunctive treatments [12] and early admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [13] may all reduce inpatient mortality from IPD. The accurate identification of individual patients who could benefit from these interventions remains inexact and challenging. Prognostic scoring systems [such as the pneumonia severity index (PSI) [14] and the confusion, elevated blood urea nitrogen level, respiratory rate and blood pressure plus age \u226565 years (CURB 65 score) [15] ] stratify patients in large cohorts according to mortality risk in order to identify those who can be safely managed in an outpatient setting. However, both of these clinical scores and consensus guidelines do not reliably identify individual patients requiring ICU escalation [13, [16] [17] [18] [19] . In contrast, there are increasing data that correlate pneumococcal bacterial load measured by molecular assays with clinical outcome [20, 21] : detection of high bacterial load has specificity exceeding 80 % for septic shock and mechanical ventilation [21] [22] [23] . Thus, besides diagnostic utility in organism identification, the quantification of bacterial load may be useful in stratifying individuals with IPD to determine the site and intensity of inpatient care [13, 24] . DNA assays have increasing sensitivity and utility in the diagnosis of IPD in patients with negative blood cultures [21, 25] . However, DNA assays do have limitations: they may be only 60-85 % sensitive in patients with positive blood cultures, do not routinely yield antibiotic sensitivity data and require potentially expensive specialist facilities and expertise [21, 23] . Culture of viable pathogens from the bloodstream is intrinsically superior to the detection of pathogenic DNA and remains fundamental to the initial diagnostic work-up for sepsis [26] .

It is well recognised that current clinical and microbiological tools fail to achieve this reliably in the setting of acute medical admissions [13, [16] [17] [18] [19] . Our extrapolated analysis of existing culture techniques is cheap, widely available and can be integrated into the automated process of the BACTEC blood culture analyser. The software required to optimise the BACTEC system adds negligible cost and an FR report can be generated instantaneously. Manual calculation of the FR, without additional software, takes less than 5 min. Our innovative approach may have a role in other invasive pneumococcal infections, such as meningitis, but also in sepsis caused by different organisms, where objective and early assessment of disease Our study is necessarily limited by the small sample size and its retrospective design. Bacterial load based on blood culture inoculation, and, consequently, the FR, is directly affected by preceding antibiotic administration. As far as possible in our study, we have excluded patients receiving antibiotic therapy prior to blood culture collection. However, owing to individual variation in the documentation of clinical notes, we cannot definitively report that all patients did not receive oral antibiotic preparations prior to hospital admission. In contrast, the sensitivity of DNA assays does not significantly change over days after antibiotic administration [23] . Six patients out of the ten patients who died due to invasive pneumococcal pneumonia were intentionally not escalated to intensive care or to intubation as part of the clinical plan. It may be the case that death may be preventable in patients where escalation is clinically appropriate. However, we acknowledge that this may have a compromising effect on the correlation of the FR to mortality. Alternatively, there may be unrecognised clinical or nonclinical parameters, not identified by our linear regression analyses, which predispose to the high mortality in this specific group of patients. However, the survival and non-survival groups demonstrated no statistically significant variation in the demographic or clinical profiles. With the two groups matched in this way, it suggests that the FR remains a prognostic tool of high utility. Similarly, while delays in presentation to hospital might also predict poor prognosis, owing to the untreated complications of sepsis, we could not accurately capture these data from the clinical notes audit.
