Its role in acute lung injury (ALI) remains unclear. Here, we assessed the function of Nogo-B during tissue injury in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mouse model. We found that pulmonary Nogo-B was significantly repressed after LPS instillation in C57BL/6 mice. Over-expression of pulmonary Nogo-B using an adenovirus vector carrying the Nogo-B-RFP-3flag gene (Ad-Nogo-B) significantly prolonged the survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of LPS. The Ad-Nogo-Btreated mice also had less severe lung injury, less alveolar protein exudation, and a higher number of macrophages but less neutrophil infiltration compared with Ad-RFP-treated mice. Interestingly, microarray analysis showed that the Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice had different gene expression profiles compared with the controls and the prominent expression of genes related to wound healing and the humoral immune response after LPS induction. Of the 49 differently expressed genes, we found that the expression of PTX3 was significantly up-regulated following Nogo-B over-expression as observed in lung tissues and RAW264.7 cells.

We first found that Nogo-B expression in the lungs was greatly suppressed in mice with LPS-induced ALI, suggesting that it is involved in the development of acute inflammation and the related lung injury. Nogo-B is highly expressed in the lungs, kidneys, liver and cardiovascular systems. Previous studies have revealed that endogenous Nogo-B plays roles in vessel regeneration 29 , tissue repair 17 , inflammation 16 and apoptosis 12, 30 . Clinical evidence indicates that in patients with asthma 13 , atherosclerosis 31 and aneurysms 32 , local Nogo-B expression is inhibited. In accordance with these results, in animal models of acute or chronic asthma 10,13 and vascular injury 9 , Nogo-B has also been found to be down-regulated. However, two groups have recently reported that Nogo-B levels are greatly increased during vessel ischemia 11 and liver cirrhosis 33 , suggesting that it has complex roles under different pathological conditions. The over-expression of pulmonary Nogo-B prolonged the survival time of mice, alleviated lung injury and reduced alveolar protein exudation and neutrophil infiltration. In addition, it increased MCP-1 secretion and the number of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the alveolar space, in accordance with a previous study showing that Nogo-B knockout mice exhibit impaired MCP-1 and CCR2 induction upon tissue injury 11 .

Furthermore, CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-knockout mice show the reduced recruitment of AMs and, greater neutrophil infiltration and severity of lung injury 37 . Because MCP-1 is a potent cytokine involved in macrophage migration and recruitment, these results suggest that sufficient MCP-1 secretion and AM recruitment are also protective factors in ALI. Therefore, the increase in the numbers of AMs induced by Nogo-B expression before LPS stimulation might be a reason for the reduced neutrophil recruitment in mice with LPS-induced ALI. Another explanation may be the elevated MCP-1 levels. In addition to being a chemotactic factor for macrophages, MCP-1 itself functions as a protective factor in ALI by promoting N 2 O production through the MCP-1/CCR2 pathway, as reported by Okuma et al. 38 . However, we did not find any difference in TNF-\u03b1 secretion following LPS challenge.

Using microarray and PubMatrix analysis, we identified 4 genes (LIF, Nppa, CXCL11, and PTX3) that might function downstream of Nogo-B over-expression. LIF is known to inhibit leukocyte migration in LPS-induced lung inflammation, and its elevation in ALI is beneficial for the alleviation of inflammation 39 . CXCL11 is a cytokine for activated T cells 40 , which binds CXCR3 with high affinity and has the potential to restrain inflammatory autoimmunity 41 .
