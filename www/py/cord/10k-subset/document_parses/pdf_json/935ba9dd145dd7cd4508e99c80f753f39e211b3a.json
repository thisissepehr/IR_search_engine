It is well established that the melting point of a solid material can be greatly reduced when the size is reduced to the nanometer scale [4] . Yang and coworkers studied the melting and recrystallization of germanium nanowires encapsulated by a carbon film. Two important phenomena have been observed: the first is the low value of the melting point, which is inversely proportional to the diameter of the nanowire. The second phenomenon concerns the large hysteresis associated with recrystallization-fused ring [9] . Wang, Lee and colleagues found that the silicon nanostructures of various morphologies are formed at different temperatures after thermal evaporation of a mixture Si / SiO2 [10] . In addition to silicon nanowires, they observed several other silicon nanostructures with significant returns. They also found that the formation and annealing temperatures have played important roles in determining the relative ratios of these nanostructures in the final mixture. It is possible to achieve a good control over the morphology and crystallinity of the silicon nanostructures simply by varying the temperature. This result represents an important step towards the design and controlled synthesis of nanostructures knowing their thermal stability. The remarkable reduction of the melting point associated with the diameter of the nanowires has several implications. First, the annealing temperature necessary for the synthesis of a nanowire without defects could be a small fraction of the annealing temperature required for solid. It is thus possible to perform refining of the nanowires at relatively low temperatures. Second, reducing the melting point allows connecting and disconnecting the nanowires at relatively low temperatures. These opportunities can provide a new tool to integrate these dimensional nanostructures into devices and circuits. Finally, when the size of the nanowires is reduced, they can become extremely sensitive to environmental change and in particular to the fluctuation of temperature and the residual variation of the mechanical stresses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 264, "end": 267, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 640, "end": 643, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 819, "end": 823, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Unlike extensive studies on the transport of electrons, research on phonon transport in one-dimensional nanostructures was discussed only recently [11] .

Given that the size of a one-dimensional nanostructure is reduced to the range of the phonon mean free paths, the thermal conductivity will be reduced, due to the dispersion caused by the defects. Theoretical studies have suggested that in nanowires with a diameter less than 20 nm, the phonon dispersion relation may be changed (due to the confinement of phonons) such that the speed of a group of phonons would very significantly well below their speed in the bulk [11] . Molecular dynamic simulations have also shown that the thermal conductivities of the silicon nanowires may be two times smaller than those of a silicon substrate at room temperature.

The length scale corresponds to the regime of quantum confinement ranges from 1 to 25 nm for typical semiconductor groups of IV, III-V and II-VI.

According to this mechanism showed in Fig. 3 , the anisotropic crystal growth is promoted by the presence of liquid alloy/solid interface. This technique is carried out in the presence of gold (Au) or other metal nanoparticles catalysts at high temperature. Based on Si-Au binary phase diagram, Si (from the decomposition of SiH 4 ) and Au form a liquid alloy when the temperature is higher than the eutectic point (363\u00b0C). The liquid surface has a large accommodation coefficient and is therefore a preferred deposition site for incoming Si vapor.

In this process, the diameter of the nanowires is determined by the diameter of the catalyst particles and therefore, the method provides an efficient means to obtain uniform-sized nanowires. SiNWs with narrow size distribution were obtained by using well defined catalysts (e.g., gold nanoparticles). It was possible to tune the electronic properties of the nanowires by including doping precursors in the silane gas. Boron and phosphorus-doped silicon nanowires were obtained this way [17] [18] [19] . Controlling the growth orientation is important for the applications of nanowires. Nanowires generally have preferred growth directions. For example, silicon nanowires grow along the {111} direction when grown by the VLS process, but can be made to grow along the {112} or the {110} direction by the oxide-assisted growth mechanism. These results demonstrate a clear preference for growth along the {1 1 0} direction in the smallest SiNWs and along the {1 1 1} direction in larger SiNWs [19] . Direct evidence for germanium nanowire growth mechanism in a VLS process has unambiguously been confirmed by conducting real-time in situ TEM studies at high temperature as shown in Fig. 4 [20] . The experiment result shows clearly three growth stages: formation of Au-Ge alloy, nucleation of Ge nanocrystal and elongation of Ge nanowire.

When a solution of streptavidin is brought to the nanowires biotin modified, it is seen that the conductance increased rapidly until it reaches a constant value. This result is explained by the negative charge contributed by streptavidin, (due to the pH of the medium in which the experiment was performed) thereby inducing a charge carrier accumulation in the nanowire (p-type).

Densely packed vertical wires can improve light absorption thanks to their anti-reflective and light trapping properties. However, what is even more interesting is that they offer the advantage of decoupling light absorption and carrier collection into orthogonal directions by using a radial junction: while photogenerated minority carriers are collected in the radial direction, incident light is absorbed axially. Nanowires can be as long as needed to absorb all the light and thinner than the minority-carrier diffusion length. This carry the possibility of optimizing both absorption and carrier collection while using low-quality materials as active PV components [60, 61] . It was Kayes et al. in 2005 who first gave a boost to the field demonstrating theoretically the benefits of using this configuration. Large efficiency gains (from 1.5 to 11 %) were predicted for silicon nanowires [60] .

The same group compared, later on, the response of optimized p-i-n nanowires in axial and coaxial geometries [63] . The first attempt on contacting vertical arrays of nanowires in parallel were published by Tsakalakos et al. [64] . P-core silicon wires grow n by means of a VLS process coated with a conformal Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposited n-doped a-Si:H shell on stainless steel substrate were fabricated Fig. 20a . Although the results were low (Voc~0.13 V, FF~0.28 and \u03b7~0.1 %) they constituted the proof-of-concept of using such nanostructures on large area devices Fig. 20b . Those results were later on improved by other groups [65] [66] [67] [68] . For instance, the group of Atwater fabricated vertically aligned arrays of crystalline p-n junction Si microwires grown by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process, exhibiting 3.81 % conversion of simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination to electrical energy [69] . This performance was improved up to 5.64 % by introducing Al 2 O 3 particles in between the wires to scatter incident light and the best response was obtained by adding a passivation a-SiNx:H layer, a Ag back reflector and Al 2 O 3 scattering particles. This device produced a V oc of 0.5 V, a J sc of 24.3 mA/cm 2 , a FF of 0.65 and an efficiency of 7.92 %. But the best results on nanowire-based solar cells published up to now were obtained by the group of Borgstr\u00f6m [70] . They succeeded in fabricating axial p-i-n InP nanowires arrays on p-doped InP substrate with efficiences up to 13.8 %. They identified two key elements to optimize the cell performance: the nanowire diameter and the length of the top n-part. Moreover, even if InP has a direct and optimal band gap (1.34 eV) for single junction devices, they understood that light absorption in nanowires does not follow the ray optics law. Actually, many works have also been focused on improving the optical absorption. Zhu et al. proposed the use of nanocones and nanodomes to gradually reduce the effective Fig. 19 Virus detection by a modified silicon nanowire [59] refractive index [71, 72] .

The insertion of lithium results in an increase in volume (about 400 times). The stresses exerted by these volume changes during insertion and removal of lithium cause the cracking of the silicon film and thus a loss of contact with the collector. The formation of stable and dense stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) over the Si surface, is also affected by the large volume change. This (SEI) act as an ionic conducting and electronic insulation passivation layer to impede side chemical reactions to occur [73] .
