In contrast, all the 3' end probes were specific for the homologous virus. However, a long HRV-9 probe detected a large number of serotypes.",

Furthermore, recent community studies in Michigan, U.S.A., suggested that rhinoviruses can be isolated from up to 70 percent of adults (over 40 years of age) with lower respiratory tract involvement [15] .

It is anticipated that with further progress in the field it may be possible to treat these infections. However, rapid virus identification prior to treatment would be essential since these antivirals are specific for rhinoviruses. Until recently, rhinoviruses could only be identified by growth in a sensitive cell culture. Such procedures are time consuming, labour intensive and require considerable expertise. Although, it is now possible to detect rhinovirus antigens directly in nasal washings using immunologically based methods such as ELISA [10] , the diversity of serotypes, recently estimated to be around 100 [12] makes efficient detection of all serotypes difficult. We have therefore, attempted to overcome this problem by developing procedures based on R N A detection.",

In both cases the fragments were subcloned into the phage vector M 13 mp 18 in the positive sense orientation. The templates were used to produce radioactive cDNA probes complementary to viral sense RNA by extension of an M 13 universal primer in a reaction performed by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase 1. Annealing of the primer/template was achieved by boiling together (3 min) in a mixture (20 lal) comprising primer (5 ng), template (1 lag), 15 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, and 7.5 mM MgCI2. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and to it was added dGTP, dCTP dTTP (to a final concentration of 0.5 raM), 32p_ dATP (20 laCi) Klenow fragment (5 units) and water to give a final volume of 50 ~tl. The reaction took place at room temperature for 30 minutes after which the radioactive DNA was separated from unincorporated nucleotides by passage through a Sephadex G 100 column.",

It therefore appears that the efficiency of detection is more directly related to other factors, the most important of which is probably the degree of RNA homology between the RNA of the different rhinoviruses. Table 2 shows the strength of the signal observed using the various viruses and seven probes. It can be seen that the reactions varied greatly in intensity. Thus, the HRV-14, 5' end probe gave a very strong signal (+ + + +) when hybridized with RNA from HRV-3, 4, and 49 and a strong signal (+ + +) when reacted with RNA from HRV-2, 41, 47, 56, 62, 72, and 85.

These results are therefore in agreement with our earlier findings with the HRV-14 probe [2] and show that although there is considerable homology in the 5' end noncoding region of many rhinoviruses it is still not sufficient for a probe prepared from this region to detect all the different rhinovirus serotypes with equal efficiency. Furthermore, in tests on clinical material, both the identity of the infecting serotype and its concentration in nasal secretion would vary widely. In this study there were great variations in the signal given by the different serotypes even though the titres of virus used were usually greater than 10 4 TCIDs0/ml which is much higher than that normally found in nasal washing (often < l 0 2 TCIDs0/ml).",
