The result tables and files are linked to the version of the model and the input parameters that collectively generated the results. The result tables are warehoused in a relational database that permits them to be easily identified, categorized, and downloaded.",

In order to understand and control the spread of pathogens, it is essential to establish some of the key parameters associated with disease transmission. Fundamental to the dynamics of an epidemic are two quantities: the basic reproduction number (R0) and the generation time (Tg) of the pathogen [1] . The R0 is the average number of secondary cases produced by each primary case at the start of an epidemic in a previously unaffected population. The Tg is the average time between infection of index cases and the secondary cases they produce. The R0 is a measure of the transmissibility of the strain in the population, and largely determines the proportion of the population that will be infected in a pandemic. The ratio R0/Tg is a measure of an epidemic's rate of growth.",

These models assume that the rate at which new infections are acquired is proportional to the number of encounters between susceptible and infected individuals, and leads to an effective reproductive ratio that depends on a threshold density of susceptibles. Thus, the models depend not only on parameters intrinsic to the disease such as latent and infectious periods, but also on contacts between infectious and susceptible hosts. Historically, structuring the population at risk into compartments permits subpopulations of varying risks to be represented. Compartmental models of this kind implicitly assume that the host population is well mixed, such that the probability of infection is equal for all.",

To overcome the simplifying assumption of classical transmission models, a new type of model is gaining recognition. Agent-based models (ABMs) represent an important new approach for describing interacting heterogeneous agents. The heterogeneous aspect of agents enables more sophisticated and complex environments to be described by ABMs approaches. Also, it is typical to introduce a geospatial dimension into the framework so that both time and geographical patterns are represented. Thus, every ABM run identifies infected persons where they live and work in general, and their movements within groups (referred to as social networks) that influence disease spread. ABMs have been used to describe phenomena from social systems to immune systems, both of which are distributed collections of interacting entities (agents) that function without a leader. Simple agents interact locally according to simple rules of behavior, responding in appropriate ways to environmental cues and not necessarily striving to achieve an overall goal. An ABM consists of a set of agents that encapsulate the behaviors of the individuals that make up the system, and model execution consists of emulating these behaviors [2] .",

            "text": "3) Models of Influenza Transmission: The major focus of the MIDAS research partnership has been pandemic influenza. In response to the MIDAS mission (see http://grants.nih.gov/ grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-GM-06-106.html), a number of large ABMs describing influenza transmission were developed. The main purpose of the models was to examine possible intervention strategies that would protect the general public from morbidity and mortality should an influenza pandemic strike. One of the initial objectives in all disease transmission studies is to determine the basic R0 value. The goal of intervention is to reduce R0 below the self-sustaining threshold of R0 = 1. The R0 of a future newly emergent influenza strain is unknown, but estimates for previous pandemics are available. For example, an estimate of 1.89 was obtained for the pandemic of 1968 in Hong Kong [3] , and the pandemic of 1957 in Great Britain (GB) was estimated to be between 1.5-1.7 [4] . Also, the reproductive number of the first wave of the 1918 pandemic in the United States was estimated as 2-3 [5] . There is historical evidence that these three influenza pandemics were explosive. The results reported by the MIDAS also suggest that the pandemics can be controlled to some degree. By comparison, childhood diseases such as rubella, pertussis, and measles have R0 values in most populations in the range 7-15 [6] , and consequently, are much less controllable.",

To some extent, the results depend on the assumptions made by the modelers about transmission in the different contexts. The degree of uncertainty does depend on the specific control measures. Modelers can arguably better project the possible effects of antiviral and vaccine use, case isolation, and household quarantine than the effects of school closure, mask use, banning of mass-gatherings, or nonspecific social distancing measures.",

Characteristics of MIDAS models across all modeling groups can be quickly identified and linked to relevant documentation. Second, a quality assurance mechanism for registering models into the MREP. For a model to be part of the MREP, it must: 1) have a name; 2) be linked to a readily available description; 3) be linked to a contact; 4) identify the date and time of creation; and 5) specify the terms of distribution. The registration system is consistent with the process identified by Le Nov\u00e8re et al. [10] . Third, a tracking mechanism that catalogs, locates, and identifies the different versions of the models involved in different experiments that comprise MIDAS studies. Fourth, the MREP has productivity features that allow modelers to efficiently locate previous model versions and reuse the code in new models. Fifth, the MREP maintains inventories of work developed by the research groups in a locatable form.",

The most common model development languages represented in the MREP are anticipated to be C, C++, Java, and Matlab. To maintain control in a language-free environment, using a version control element was deemed essential.",

This will potentially necessitate using a query tool to readily identify models of interest. For example, the MIDAS ABMs use synthetic population data that describe a specific geographical region. The model results identify individuals that influence disease spread within that region. The query tool enables users to identify a set of model results that pertain to a region of interest. Then, by using the geospatial identifiers that are tagged to individual model results, users can drill down into subregions and neighborhoods that are affected by epidemics. Please note that it is possible to use the search keys to identify the studies that focus on a particular type of intervention strategy, and then, by examining Model Version details, determine the implementation details to decide a target computer to rerun the model.

This is an ongoing study that consists of six sets of experiments: two U.S. experiments, three Chicago-based experiments, and a historic study that examined certain characteristics of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Each study is associated with a single model with a single version per model. The objective of the combined study is to simulate a set of scenarios at the city and the national level. The scenarios are designed to address specific concerns by various federal agencies. The entire study amounts to about 150 distinct scenarios, each with multiple (thousands of) runs. This is an ongoing study that will be loaded into the MREP. Currently, only the principle results are loaded into the MREP; the code that generated the results has not yet been loaded.",

The strength of the MREP's design is its data model hierarchy that accurately portrays the stages of a study and its derivatives, at least from the MIDAS perspective. This data model begins with a high-level study as represented by an overall set of study objectives and design specifications and culminates at a low level with a set of runs (results) that contribute to assessing those objectives. In between the studies and the runs linked to those studies are the experiments that represent the different and independent points of view characterized by different research groups and the models those groups used to generate their results. The final data model design element is based on the assumption that containment strategies are not always accommodated within a single model; a change in the model code is sometimes the favored approach for representing simulated behavior differences, that is, the containment strategy responses.",
