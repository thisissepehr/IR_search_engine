Rather than being inactivated, ricin evades normal degradative pathways and kills both KCs and LSECs with remarkable efficiency. Uptake of ricin by these 2 specialized cell types in the liver occurs by 2 parallel routes: a \"lactose-sensitive\" pathway mediated by ricin's galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin subunit (RTB), and a \"mannose-sensitive\" pathway mediated by the mannose receptor (MR; CD206) or other C-type lectins capable of recognizing the mannose-side chains displayed on ricin's A (RTA) and B subunits. In this report, we investigated the capacity of a collection of ricin-specific mouse MAb and camelid single-domain (V H H) antibodies to protect KCs and LSECs from ricin-induced killing. In the case of KCs, individual MAbs against RTA or RTB afforded near complete protection against ricin in ex vivo and in vivo challenge studies. In contrast, individual MAbs or V H Hs afforded little (<40%) or even no protection to LSECs against ricin-induced death. Complete protection of LSECs was only achieved with MAb or V H H cocktails, with the most effective mixtures targeting RTA and RTB simultaneously.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Although the exact mechanisms of protection of LSECs remain unknown, evidence indicates that the Ab cocktails exert their effects on the mannose-sensitive uptake pathway without the need for Fc receptor involvement.

[3] [4] [5] Because the addition of exogenous lactose inhibits RTB-mediated attachment to host cells, this pathway is referred to as a \"lactose-sensitive\" pathway. 6 Ricin can also gain entry into certain cells types through a \"mannose-sensitive\" pathway that was first described on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BDMCs) and later shown to exist on Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Ricin is mannosylated at 3 different asparagine residues; 1 on RTA (position 95) and 2 on RTB (positions 135 and 280). [11] [12] [13] A number of studies have implicated the mannose receptor (MR:CD206) as being responsible for ricin uptake into BDMC, KCs, and LSECs, although most of those studies were conducted years before the full suite of the C-type lectins (CTL) and their roles in pathogen recognition were discovered. 14 Nonetheless, the mannose-sensitive pathway is a highly efficient route by which ricin enters and kills in KCs and LSECs, due in part to increased rates of internalization, as compared with the lactose-sensitive uptake pathway. [8] [9] [10] In this report, we sought to revisit the sensitivity of KCs and LSECs to ricin in light of efforts to develop MAb-based therapies and prophylactics for ricin exposure. [15] [16] [17] [18] For example, we recently demonstrated that i.v. delivery of a single MAb, PB10, directed against RTA was able to rescue Rhesus macaques from lethal dose aerosol challenge if administered within a 4 h window. 17 In that model, ricin intoxication is largely restricted to the lung with little systemic involvement. 19 In contrast, following injection, ricin homes to the liver where it concentrates in KCs and LSECs.

This study was motivated by the fact that 94, 95 That cargo is then destined for degradation via the lysosome or proteolytically processed and loaded onto major histocompatibility complexes. How ricin evades these fates following uptake by the MR or another CTL is unknown. There is evidence that ricin passes through an acidic compartment following uptake via the mannosesensitive pathway, but ricin has no known mechanism to breach the endocytic membrane. 6 Similarly, ricin-MAb complexes such as those generated in this study would be expected to be taken up by LSECs by way of Fc RIIb2. 28, 79, 96, 97 Fc RIIb2 is an inhibitory Fc-receptor primarily expressed on LSECs and secondarily on KCs and is the largest contributor to clearance of SICs from circulation. Although Fc RIIB would not be able to internalize one-to-one toxin-Ab complexes (e.g., PB10ricin), it would be predicted to engage with ricin decorated by 2 or more MAbs (e.g., PB10 + SyH3) and route them for degradation. Whether or not Fc RIIB plays a role in clearance of ricin immune complexes in vivo remains to be determined.

Neither lactose nor mannan alone abrogated the effect of ricin (Fig. 2). However, the combination of lactose and mannan afforded partial protection (\u223c40% viability) against ricin-induced cell death, consistent with ricin internalization into KCs occurring via RTB and the MR.

The combination of lactose and mannan did not significantly inhibit binding of ricin to KCs beyond lactose alone. These results indicate that the vast majority of ricin associates with KCs by virtue of RTB's Gal/GalNAcspecific lectin activity, whereas the MR accounts for just a fraction of ricin binding. However, despite the differences in binding, the 2 pathways apparently contribute equally to ricin uptake, as neither lactose nor mannan alone impacted ricin cytotoxicity on KCs. This apparent disconnect is explained by the fact that RTB-mediated uptake is inefficient, whereas the MR uptake is extremely efficient. 6,63 Thus, even small amounts of ricin bound to the MR can result in productive intoxication and cell death.It should be pointed out that the mannan and lactose mixture only partially protected KCs from ricin, indicating the existence of aF I G U R E 3 Protection of KCs and J774E cells from ricin toxicity by individual anti-RTA MAbs.Freshly isolated KCs (panels A, C, and E) or J774E cells (panels B, D, and F) were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates and then treated with ricin plus indicated amount of anti-RTA MAbs for 18 h.

Each data point represents the average (with corresponding standard deviations) of 3 independent experiments third uptake pathway in these cells. Although not investigated here, RTA-derived peptides containing the LDV sequence have been shown to trigger apoptosis of HUVECs via a process that is inhibited by fibronectin and likely integrin mediated.[64][65][66] In the case of J774E cells, lactose alone completely inhibited ricin binding to cell surfaces and also protected cells from ricin intoxication (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. S2). Mannan did not affect ricin attachment to J774E cells nor did it impact ricin's cytotoxic activity. Thus, ricin intoxication of J77E cells is solely dependent on RTB's lectin activity, even though the cells express the MR on their surface (SupplementalFig. S2).

Two other MAbs, SyH7 and PA1, fared slightly better (\u223c40% viability), but never achieved complete protection.The failure of the individual MAbs to neutralize ricin in the LSEC cytotoxicity assay prompted us to test a combination of all 4 anti-RTA MAbs, effectively creating a quadrivalent cocktail targeting the 4 known neutralizing hotspots on RTA. The quadrivalent Ab mixture demonstrated extremely potent toxin-neutralizing activity in the LSEC cytotoxicity assay, with an IC 50 of <0.2 \u00b5g/ml (Fig. 6). In an effort to ascribe the neutralizing activity to particular MAb combination, the 4 different MAbs were tested in all possible combinations (Supplemental Fig. S5).

Nonetheless, individual MAbs against RTA or RTB were able to protect KCs ex vivo with efficiencies similar to J774E cells. In addition, 2 MAbs, PB10 and SyH3, were each able to protect KCs from ricin-induced apoptosis in vivo. Thus, despite their remarkable sensitivity to ricin toxin, KCs are readily protected from toxin-induced death by anti-RTA and anti-RTB MAbs.LSECs were another story. We found that individual anti-RTA and anti-RTB MAbs had virtually no capacity to protect LSECs from ricin intoxication. For example, even PB10, which has been shown to be able to rescue Rhesus macaques from lethal dose ricin exposure by aerosol, afforded less than 20% protection in the LSEC killing assay. This shortcoming was overcome when PB10 was combined with other MAbs. The most effective combination was a 2-part cocktail targeting RTA and RTB (i.e., PB10 + SyH3), although other pairs and oligoclonal mixtures were equally functional. Combinations of V H Hs, which are monovalent and lack Fc elements, also had neutralizing activity, demonstrating that neither ricin crosslinking (aggregation) nor FcR engagement is necessary to protect LSECs from ricin intoxication.When considering possible mechanisms by which MAbs protectKCs and LSECs, it is important to keep in mind that ricin uptake by these 2 cell types occurs by at least 2 distinct pathways: one inhibited by exogenous lactose (\"lactose-sensitive\") and the other by exogenous mannose or mannan (\"mannose-sensitive\"). The lactose-dependent endocytic pathway, which has been studied in great detail, is mediated by RTB's affinity for terminal Gal/GalNAc residues on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids.63 Following endocytosis, ricin holotoxin is trafficked retrograde to the TGN and the ER, where RTA is liberated from RTB and translocated into the cytoplasm.84 This uptake pathway is inefficient, however, as only a small fraction (1%-10%) of the total amount of ricin bound to any given cell surface actually results in delivery of RTA into the cytoplasm.84,85 Moreover, ricin is easily derailed during retrograde transport, particularly if the toxin is aggregated or complexed with another protein.86 All things considered, perhaps it is not surprising that ricin-MAb complexes are recycled or inefficiently routed to the TGN.67,71,87 The mannose-sensitive uptake pathway exploited by ricin to intoxicate liver cells is much less well understood. Although uptake has historically been attributed to the MR, this assumption is inconsistent with demonstration that MR knock-out mice are significantly more susceptible (not more resistant) to toxin-induced death than agematched controls.6,[8][9][10]88 Moreover, LSECs are sensitive to ricin toxin even though the MR is only expressed on the CD146+/CD45+ LSEC subset (\u223c18% of total population) and not on the CD146-/CD45+ subset. Therefore, it is plausible that mannose-sensitive uptake of ricin is mediated by a second CTL. One candidate is LSECtin, a single domain CTL with homology to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR expressed exclusively in the liver.89 LSECtin serves as a receptor for Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, and Japanese encephalitis virus.73,90 We found that recombinant LSECtin recognized ricin toxin in a solid phase binding assay and that the interaction was inhibited by mannan. Assessing the contribution of LSECtin in promoting ricin intoxication of LSECs in vivo awaits testing in LSECtin knockout mice.91 Nevertheless, it remains unclear how ricin and ricin-IC evade degradation following uptake by LSECs. A cardinal feature of LSECs is their extraordinary capacity to degrade endocytosed materials, including SIC.26,27,50,92,93 Scavenging receptors like the MR, for example, release cargo within acidified endosomes before being recycled back to the cell surface.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF9": {"text": "TABLE 1 Enrichment and viability of mouse KCs and LSECs", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>KCsa </td><td>LSECsa\n</td></tr><tr><td>Yield </td><td>1.6-2.9\u00d7 106 </td><td>7.07-11.0\u00d7 106\n</td></tr><tr><td>% Purityb </td><td>95.8\u00b1 0.608 </td><td>85.16\u00b1 1.76\n</td></tr><tr><td>%Viability (TB) </td><td>92.8\u00b1 2.58 </td><td>90.42\u00b1 3.45\n</td></tr><tr><td>%Viability (PI)c </td><td>94.68\u00b1 2.55 </td><td>91.79\u00b1 1.53\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF10": {"text": "TABLE 2 Sensitivity of LSECs, KCs, and J774E cells to ricin toxin and RTA a", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Ricin </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>RTA\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>EC50 </td><td>EC90 </td><td>EC50 </td><td>EC90\n</td></tr><tr><td>LSEC </td><td>0.87 </td><td>2.63 </td><td>50.0 </td><td>&gt;400\n</td></tr><tr><td>KC </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>5.30 </td><td>177\n</td></tr><tr><td>J774E </td><td>1.5 </td><td>2.97 </td><td>&gt;400 </td><td>&gt;400\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "acknowledgement"}, {"text": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7872-3338Nicholas J.
