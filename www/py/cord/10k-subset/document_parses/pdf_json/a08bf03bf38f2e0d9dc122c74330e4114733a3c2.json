This method enables a real-time imaging-based study of cellular behavior in response to controlled induction of signaling events in a specifi cally targeted cellular compartment. We provide rationales and a step-by-step protocol for probe design and imaging of protein targeting along with two different applications of this technique. One application involves organelle-specifi c activation of small GTPases, while the other application involves membrane tethering of two different organelles. In the former case, we activate Rac1 and Ras at distinct intracellular locations in order to study compartmentalization of their signaling pathways, and in the latter example, we induce membrane tethering of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in order to study organelle-organelle communication. The described technique allows to rapidly perturb molecular activities and organelle-organelle communications at precise locations with specifi ed timing and represents a powerful strategy to dissect spatiotemporally complex biological processes.",

Elucidation of the nature and functions of complex signaling networks requires development of cellular probes that operate in the same time scale as the signaling events themselves, act in well-defi ned cellular domains, and can be activated at defi ned time points [ 1 ] . A major strategy employed for this purpose involves a chemically induced heterodimerization to trigger rapid-onset and specifi c perturbations of various signaling molecules in living cells [ 2 -8 ] . Since most signaling events compose networks operating at multiple intracellular locations [ 9 ] , it is important to specifi cally induce signaling in distinct cellular organelles, such as plasma membrane, the Golgi complex, mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), or lysosomes.",

Specifi cally, we designed an anchoring unit that is attached to the cytoplasmic face of a specifi c organelle and an effector unit that is present in the cytosol and induces a signaling event upon translocation to the target membrane. Such translocation occurs via dimerization of the effector with the anchor, and it can induce site-specifi c signaling events on the organelle targeted by the anchoring unit ( see Fig. 1 , left). Furthermore, this technique can be used to dimerize two anchoring units (targeted to different organelles) in order to induce tethering of these organelles ( see Fig. 1 , right).",

This unit also includes a fl uorescent protein and one of the two dimerizing ; however, it may be important to design novel organelle anchors. Here, we describe how to develop such a novel unit using the Golgi anchoring motif as an example. Since it is impossible to predict the cellular localization of a particular protein based on its structural features, new anchors should be developed using a trial-and-error approach involving structural analysis of known organelle-resident proteins. To obtain motifs that specifi cally target the Golgi complex, we tried four different Golgi proteins and found that constructs derived from giantin work the best (Fig. 4 ). Giantin is a Golgi-specifi c structural protein [ 14 ] that is known to interact with multiple proteins to maintain the Golgi structure [ 15 ] . Since we intended to eliminate unwanted interactions between the anchoring unit and other proteins, we focused on the giantin sequence around its transmembrane domain (TMD). We found that a minimum sequence around the TMD is successfully targeted to the Golgi without disrupting morphology of this organelle. Therefore, this sequence was selected as the Golgi anchoring unit.",

For the DMSO-sensitive cell lines (such as neural cells) the fi nal vehicle concentration can be reduced. Adding the same concentration of DMSO to all appropriate controls is essential.8. The stock solutions should be divided into single-use aliquots that are stored at \u221220 \u00b0C to avoid repeated freeze-and-thaw cycles. During the experiment, the aliquots should be kept on ice before use.9. Since membrane targeting experiments are usually performed to better understand different steps of the signaling pathways induced by external stimuli, such as growth factors, it is desirable to compare the effects of chemical dimerizers with the effects of physiological stimuli. Such stimuli may also be used as a positive control for cellular responses and biosensors.10. Many lipophilic sensors are diffi cult to solubilize and being introduced into the cell. To prepare stock solutions of such sensors, the manufacturer's instructions should be strictly followed. In general, lipid solutions in organic solvents are dried and then reconstituted in buffers containing defatted BSA with rigorous vortexing, and the resulting BSA-lipid complexes are diluted to the appropriate concentration before adding to the cells.11. Since growth factors and nutrients in FBS can cause nonspecifi c signaling in the transfected cells, the imaging experiments should be performed in the FBS-free medium.",
