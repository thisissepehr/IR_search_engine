First, certain groups of patients, who are usually not at risk of complications or death from seasonal influenza, are at special risk with the influenza A (H1N1) virus, including pregnant or postpartum women, asthmatic or obese patients, and young subjects. [3] [4] [5] Second, this virus has a special tropism for the lower airways. Accordingly, acute viral pneumonitis, with or without bacterial superinfection, and airflow limitation occur frequently. 6, 7 For the most part, patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) are admitted to hospital for respiratory failure that progresses rapidly, usually within one day, into severe respiratory failure necessitating admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and rescue ventilatory strategies. 3, 7, 8 Such patients present with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high morbidity and mortality rates (15-40%). 3, 9, 10 These pulmonary and remote alterations present many similarities to ''bacterial'' sepsis, even though they may occur in the absence of bacterial infection. The H1N1 infection is associated with a strong pulmonary inflammatory response with increased production of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, and interferon-gamma (IFN-c). 11 This proinflammatory response is not restricted to the lungs. Recently, Bermejo-Martin et al. 12 reported that systemic levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased in patients hospitalized with H1N1 infection, especially in those who were critically ill. Remote organ dysfunction may also be observed, including elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and shock. 9 In sepsis, severe microcirculatory alterations have been observed. 13 These alterations may have important implications, as the microcirculation is the principal site of oxygen exchange between blood and underlying tissues. Additionally, anomalies of the microcirculatory network have been consistently demonstrated as being associated with organ dysfunction and mortality. 14, 15 However, microcirculatory alterations have not yet been reported in patients with viral infections. We hypothesized that microcirculatory abnormalities may be present in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) infection, participating in local and remote tissue injury. During the H1N1 pandemic in the fall of 2009, we evaluated the microcirculation of critically ill patients admitted to hospital with severe respiratory failure associated with influenza-like syndrome in order to evaluate the degree of microcirculatory dysfunction in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1203, "end": 1205, "text": "de", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1207, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1688, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1692, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1696, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1884, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1885, "end": 1886, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2170, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2171, "end": 2173, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2174, "end": 2175, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2328, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2331, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2334, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2658, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2753, "end": 2755, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3053, "end": 3054, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3122, "end": 3124, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3429, "end": 3432, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3433, "end": 3435, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "R\u00e9sum\u00e9"}, {"text": "All patients with acute respiratory failure associated with influenza-like illness who were admitted to the 35-bed ICU of a teaching hospital from October to December 2009 were screened for inclusion in the study.
