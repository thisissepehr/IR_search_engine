These comorbidities are diverse and affect multiple organs, thus resulting in cardiovascular, kidney, neurocognitive and liver disease, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and cancers. A common feature of these conditions is that they are generally associated with accelerated aging. The mechanism behind these comorbidities is chronic excessive inflammation induced by HIV infection, which persists under anti-retroviral therapy. Progressive simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) closely reproduces these comorbidities and offers a simplified system in which most of the traditional human risk factors for comorbidities (i.e., smoking, hyperlipidemia) are absent. Additionally, experimental conditions can be properly controlled during a shorter course of disease for SIV infection. As such, NHPs can be employed to characterize new paradigms of AIDS pathogenesis and to test the efficacy of interventions aimed at alleviating non-AIDS-related comorbidities.",

With therapies, the life expectancy of a motivated patient has increased to 59 years, albeit not yet fully restored [1] . ART has other multiple limitations: (a) it requires life-long adherence preventing effective treatment from being delivered in a sustainable way to all in need; (b) it is associated with short-and long-term toxicity; (c) it does not completely restore immune integrity; and (d) it is not curative and does not eradicate HIV-1 [1] . Additionally, patients that are effectively treated have a higher risk of non-AIDS-related overall morbidity and mortality compared to uninfected individuals of the same age [2\u2022\u2022] . Non-AIDS comorbidities are diverse and affect multiple organs thus resulting in cardiovascular (CV), kidney, neurocognitive and liver disease, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and cancers. A common feature of these conditions is that they are generally associated with aging. Indeed, HIV-infected patients experience frailty and other geriatric signs earlier than the general population [2\u2022\u2022] .",

In infected patients in whom HIV-1 replication is controlled with ART, the failure of immune recovery is associated with high levels of T cell activation [3] , inflammatory monocyte activation [4] , and increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers [5, 6, 4] . Furthermore, the biomarkers of hypercoagulability are also increased in chronically infected patients. The elevations of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers are independent predictors of significant increases in morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients compared to the general population [6, 4] . These features are so consistently observed in HIV-infected patients that it was recently proposed that they can comprise a new HIVassociated syndrome [7\u2022] .",

Both HIVs have a simian origin, with HIV-1 originating from chimpanzees/gorillas and HIV-2 originating from multiple cross-species transmissions from sooty mangabeys [8] . As both chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys are highly endangered and therefore cannot be used for controlled studies, alternative models are used that mainly rely on the use of Asian macaques [9] . Macaques are not naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in the wild, but upon experimental infection with SIVs, they develop a clinical syndrome that is remarkably similar to AIDS in humans [9] . SIV infection in macaques recapitulates the most important features of HIV infection: (i) the development of a chronic progressive infection that eventually progresses to simian AIDS (characterized by opportunistic infections, cancers, and neuropathology-neuro-AIDS); (ii) the occurrence of a controlled infection in a minority of macaques harboring specific MHC class I alleles, similar to human elite controllers; (iii) similar viral replication and CD4 + T cell depletion patterns and alteration of the same memory T cell subsets; (iv) the failure of immune responses to contain the virus; (v) the similar pathogenic consequences of viral replication, with mucosal dysfunction, microbial translocation, and persistent immune activation and inflammation; and (vi) the persistence of the virus in cellular reservoirs even after complete suppression with antiretroviral therapy [9, 10] .",

The only major limitation to the use of this model is that HIV-1 does not infect macaques because of multiple host restriction factors [11] . This limitation has largely been surpassed by using SIV for macaque infection, as multiple SIV strains infect macaques. SIVsmm/SIVmac, which are derived from sooty mangabeys, similar to HIV-2 [12] are the most widely used. SIVagm strains, which are derived from African green monkeys (AGMs) [8] , are used for infecting pigtailed macaques (PTMs), in which upon passage induces a progressive infection [13, 14] , and rhesus macaques, in which SIVagm is functionally cured [15] . Furthermore, artificial chimeras including HIV-1 genes in a backbone of SIVmac, called simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs), have been constructed for vaccine and therapeutic studies [16] . More recently, HIV-1-like chimeras were constructed with only minimal SIV content included only to counteract the host restriction factors [17] .",

Comparative studies between pathogenic SIV infections in macaques and nonpathogenic SIV infections in their natural hosts (i.e., sooty mangabeys and AGMs) decisively contributed to the new paradigms of HIV pathogenesis in which chronic immune activation, dysfunction of the lymphoid tissues, and preferential depletion/preservation of different CD4 + T cell subsets are key contributors to AIDS progression [18, 9] . In this context, one of the key questions in the field is whether or not NHP models will be useful to study the HIV comorbidities that form the current clinical landscape of AIDS. In this review, we will provide compelling evidence that NHP models can and should be employed to model HIV comorbidities and new therapeutic approaches.",

Very strong support for the role of chronic immune activation and inflammation in the pathogenesis of AIDS came from the field of SIV infection in their natural hosts. In these species, which do not develop AIDS despite high levels of virus replication, an acute increase in the levels of immune activation and inflammation [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] is resolved to preinfection levels during chronic infection [29] . Furthermore, chronic SIV infection in natural hosts does not undermine the integrity of mucosal barrier, and consequently, there is no increase in microbial translocation [30, 31] . Therefore, there is a general consensus that lack of disease progression in natural hosts is due to their ability to avoid the negative consequences of SIVrelated inflammatory responses. We confirmed the impact of chronic immune activation and inflammation on driving disease progression by administering Ontak (an IL-2 coupled with a diphtheria toxin, which targets CD25, a molecule expressed on Treg surface) to chronically SIVagm-infected AGMs. Ontak administration resulted in the increased levels of immune activation and inflammation and consequently enhanced viral replication and mucosal CD4 + T cell depletion [32] . In other sets of experiments, we mimicked microbial translocation by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to chronically SIVsab-infected AGMs, both in single dose [32] and in prolonged administration [33\u2022\u2022] . In both experiments, LPS increased the levels of systemic immune activation and inflammation and boosted viral replication [33\u2022\u2022, 32] . Finally, in an unpublished work, we demonstrated that alcoholinduced mucosal alterations (and microbial translocation) resulted in increased levels of systemic immune activation and inflammation in chronically infected AGMs. Altogether, these experiments provided strong support to the fact that immune activation/inflammation are key factors of disease progression. Moreover, these studies validate microbial translocation as a major driver of immune activation.",

In our unpublished studies, we observed that the agerelated alterations in immune cell populations were similar between uninfected macaques and AGMs. We also documented age-related increases in the levels of D-dimer in wild AGMs [49] . Interestingly, while SIV infection is generally nonpathogenic in natural hosts, we and others have described a handful of AIDS cases in AGMs, mandrills, sooty mangabeys, and black mangabeys [50], the vast majority of which occurred in older NHPs. Another interesting observation was that all these animals had increased persistent levels of immune activation (i.e., significantly increased Ki-67 expression in the lymph nodes) [50] . This was surprising, as it is well established that the levels of immune activation markers do not significantly change from the baseline in chronically SIV-infected NHPs that are natural hosts [50] . Finally, a common pathological feature in the old African NHPs that progressed to AIDS was a condition characterized by the severe accumulation of infected macrophages in tissues known as \"giant cell disease\" [50]. Significant increases in neopterin, an inflammatory marker related to monocyte activation, were also observed in the AIDS cases occurring in the elder NHP hosts. Altogether, these findings suggest that increased levels of immune activation and inflammation (particularly macrophage activation) that occur in older animals may drive progression to AIDS even in species that are generally resistant to disease progression.",

As such, the intestine is the main site of HIV replication and CD4 + T cell depletion [22] early in the disease course. In addition to these direct effects, HIV exerts a major indirect effect in the gut by inducing epithelial cell activation and apoptosis [22] . Altogether, these processes result in a loss of mucosal integrity and translocation of microbial products from the intestinal lumen to systemic circulation [22] . Antiretroviral therapy may alleviate these effects, but control of microbial translocation is incomplete with ART [22] and is a leading cause of residual inflammation, which in turn results in incomplete immune restoration, hypercoagulation, and comorbidities. The role of microbial translocation in inducing inflammation and hypercoagulability was directly validated in NHP models [51\u2022, 36\u2022\u2022].",

In the SIVsab PTM model, we observed frequent inflammatory infiltrates with mononuclear cells in the hepatic sinusoids or in the portal spaces and around the central vein. Sometimes, these infiltrates are severe (Fig. 1a) bridging several portal spaces, similar to the lesions observed in chronic active hepatitis.

The administration of bovine colostrum, which binds LPS and may prevent translocation, had no clinical effect in HIV-infected subjects [64] . Sevelamer administration to acutely SIV-infected NHPs improved the levels of immune activation and coagulation [36\u2022\u2022] ; in chronically HIV-infected patients, sevelamer did not reduce microbial translocation but had a statistical effect on soluble tissue factor, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and oxidized LDL cholesterol [65] . In SIV-infected macaques, treatment with IL-21 resulted in a better preservation of the intestinal Th17 cells and reduced microbial translocation [66] .

CV conditions associated with HIV infection also include hypertension, metabolic disease (hyperglycemia, lipid disorders), and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to premature coronary artery disease. Interestingly, the increased risk of MI in patients with HIV infection versus age-matched uninfected patients is observed even after adjusting for Framingham risk factors and other comorbidities, suggesting that traditional models for estimating CV risk may underestimate risk in HIV patients and that there may be pathways in the pathogenesis of CV disease that are specific to HIV-infected patients [67] .",

Furthermore, studies in NHPs clearly showed that CV disease occurs in the absence of ART thus reinforcing an independent role of SIV infection in the development of CV disease [33\u2022\u2022] . Although traditional risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia) are highly prevalent in HIV-infected subjects, evidence strongly suggests that chronic inflammation is the main factor behind CV disease, as indicated by elevations in soluble and cellular biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulation, processes which contribute to the pathogenesis of \"conventional\" CV disease.",

While the effects of the virus and treatments can be theoretically dissociated, this task is difficult to achieve, since most of HIV-infected patients are treated. Furthermore, the nature of the risk factors of CV disease (i.e., diet, alcohol and cigarette usage, sedentarism, obesity) further complicates these studies making patient matching between groups very difficult.

We have recently confirmed similar features in SIVsab-infected PTM, our model of pathogenic SIV infection, in which we identified histological lesions similar to HIVAN, i.e., the hyperplasia of the epithelial lining of the Bowman capsule (Fig. 1e ) associated with collapsing/ glomerulosclerosis glomerulopathy (Fig. 1e) , diffuse (Fig. 1f) or pseudogranulomatous (Fig. 1g ) interstitial nephritis associated with dilated microtubules containing either hyaline (Fig. 1h ) or cellular casts (Fig. 1i ). As described for HIV patients, the SIVsab-infected PTMs presented with SIV-arteriopathy in the kidney and other organs, i.e., thickened wall arteries and vessel occlusion (Fig. 2) [33\u2022\u2022] . Other SHIV-infected macaques presented with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by peripheral edema, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria [91] . A case of immunoglobulin-A nephropathy with crescentic glomerulonephritis was described in a PTM coinfected with SIVmac and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [92] . Finally, we previously described a high frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the SIVsab-infected PTMs [33\u2022\u2022], a condition described in HIV patients which is associated with a poor prognostic and accelerated death [67] . TMA is characterized by the presence of numerous microthrombi in the glomerulus capillaries [33\u2022\u2022] and in the afferent and efferent arterioles (Fig. 1d) .",

As presented here, NHP models recapitulate most of the key features of these comorbidities. NHPs have the advantage of a simplified system in which most of the risk factors for comorbidities are absent and experimental conditions (i.e., timing of infection, stage of acute or chronic SIV infection, certain diets, etc.) can be properly controlled. Similar to other areas of AIDS research, such as pathogenesis, cure or vaccine research, and pre-and postexposure prophylaxis [100] , NHP models may be instrumental for the study of non-AIDS comorbidities to characterize and better define the new landscape of AIDS pathogenesis and to test the efficacy of interventions aimed to alleviate non-AIDS-related comorbidities.

These studies have shown that in AGMs and sooty mangabeys, the resolution of immune activation and inflammation are associated with normal levels of coagulation, while in pathogenic SIV infection of the PTMs, chronic inflammation and disease progression are associated with high levels of hypercoagulopathy[33\u2022\u2022]. Both the increased levels of Ddimer (DD) and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) strongly predicted disease progression and death in NHPs[33\u2022\u2022], similar to HIV-infected patients[33\u2022\u2022].",

This paper compared the changes in the gut viral communities between pathogenic and nonpathogenic SIV infection and reported that such changes are specifically associated with pathogenic SIV infection. Conversely, no significant change in the gut viral communities could be observed during the nonpathogenic SIV infection in AGMs. As such, the paper provides a mechanistic base for the dysbiosis. 59.
