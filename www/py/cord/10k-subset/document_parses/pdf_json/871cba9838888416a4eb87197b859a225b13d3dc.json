Especially, the Weyl-derivative generahzing the derivative in Fourier space is of interest here. It is linked with the Riemann-Liouville via the Marchaud regularization [2] . In this way the Laplacian operator can be generalized to a fractional Laplacian describing L6vy flights rather than ordinary random walks. This leads to the notion of sub-and super-diffusion, well applicable in reaction-diffusion systems [6] . In epidemiological systems especially the super-diffusion case is of interest as description of more realistic spreading than normal diffusion on regular lattices. To understand even basic epidemiological processes it is often necessary to investigate well the spatial spreading since all epidemic processes happen on spatially restricted networks [7] . We have previously studied epidemic processes with reinfection on regular lattices [13] as they also appear in the physics literature [10] . A crucial question in such systems is in how far basic notions like finite spreading and phase diagrams hold not only for ordinary diffusion but also in the super-diffusion case [7, 8] . Wider processes with multi strain interaction [12, 5] could be treated similarly. As our prime example here we will investigate the susceptibleinfected-susceptible SIS epidemic, which leads in the framework of reaction diffusion processes to the well know Kolmogorov-Fisher equation [11, 9] .",

Fractional calculus, i.e. the generahzation of first, second etc. derivatives to derivatives of non-integer order, hence fractional, gives us the tools to generahze also the Laplace operator in diffusion systems. Historically, many ways of generahzing integer derivatives have been suggested. Here we use the generalization in terms of the Fourier expansion of a function, hence the Weyl-derivative, which is linked via the Marchaud-regularization to the Riemann-Liouvillederivative.
