It is characterised by capillary dilatation, production of pathological blood-borne soluble components and an increase in body temperature. Together, these responses initiate the elimination of noxious compounds and damaged tissue. The inflammatory response depends in part on the immune system, which synergises with nonimmune inflammatory mediators such as hepatocytes, neural cells and the endocrine system. Components of the inflammatory response dependent upon and independent of the immune system are induced by stimuli such as physical trauma, exercise and infection. It is not the severity of the injury or insult that governs the symptomatology or outcome of the inflammatory reaction, but rather the mode and extent of response to the original insult. [1] Cytokines are soluble proteins or glycoproteins that are produced by and mediate communication between and within immune and nonimmune cells, organs and organ systems throughout the body. They act at very low concentrations relative to other soluble molecules such as endocrine and exocrine hormones. [2] The production of cytokines can be upregulated rapidly in response to inflammatory stimuli, and this response can be transient or prolonged. Circulating concentrations indicate prognosis in various disease and nondisease states.",

            "text": "The IL-1 gene family comprises the glycoprotein receptor agonists IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1ra. Various immune and nonimmune cells produce both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. However, IL-1\u03b1 remains within the cytosol in almost all instances. [6] IL-1\u03b1 is active in both precursor and mature forms, but IL-1\u03b2 is only active upon cleavage by the cytosolic cysteine protease IL-1\u03b2 converting enzyme (ICE), found in monocytes. [7] IL-1\u03b2 remains cytosolic in nonphagocytic cells, but 40 to 60% of the IL-1\u03b2 that is produced by mononuclear phagocytes exits the cell via ves-icle exocytosis, active transport, leakage or cell death. [6] IL-1 elicits physiological effects at femto-to picomolar concentrations, above which it becomes cytotoxic. [8] It up-regulates a wide variety of genes, including those encoding cytokines, thus augmenting its own expression as well as that of IL-2 and IL-6. [5] Enzymes required for the synthesis of leukotrienes, prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO) are induced by IL-1. Prostaglandin synthesis is induced indirectly, by up-regulation of gene expression of the inducible type 2 cyclo-oxygenase. [6] Cyclo-oxygenase products in turn induce corticotropin (ACTH) release via the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis; this possibly serves as a biological negative feedback, since corticosteroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, and adrenalectomised mice have an increased risk of IL-1-induced death. [9] Responses to IL-1 include hypotension, fever, lethargy, modulation of inflammation and stimulation of cell proliferation. IL-1 induces hypotension by acting on the vasculature, the myocardium, and sodium transport. [10] It inhibits vascular smooth muscle contraction independently of prostaglandin synthesis, facilitating L-arginine-dependent NO production; this leads to increased guanylate cyclase activity. [11] In the myocardium, IL-1 suppresses the rate of spontaneous contractions, and reduces the contractile response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. [12] Systemic injection of IL-1 augments the renal excretion of sodium. [6] Within the central nervous system, IL-1 acts as a potent pyrogen, probably at the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis; IL-1 receptors are distributed throughout the hypothalamus and arachidonic acid metabolites are released from the periventricular organ endothelium in response to IL-1 injection. [13] Additionally, IL-1 mediates fever both by induction of IL-6 and also independently of the pyrogenic activity of IL-6. [6] IL-1 injection in mice induces disinterest in the environment, sleepiness and anorexia. Presumably, this reaction is analogous to the 'sickness' syndrome characteristic of human illness. It may be respon-sible for many of the symptoms associated with infection and overtraining.",

In this respect, IL-1 synergises with IL-6, but it is also capable of inducing these proteins by itself. [6] IL-1 has inflammatory and degenerative effects on joint surfaces, and systemically injected IL-1 stimulates bone resorption. [14] Aside from inhibiting the formation of collagens and proteoglycans, IL-1 induces synthesis of the metalloproteinases and gelatinases which contribute to the degradation of cartilage. This cytokine also promotes catabolism of lean tissue in synergy with tumour necrosis factor\u2212\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1); muscle protein breakdown during endotoxaemia (which is a potent stimulator of circulatory IL-1 release) can be reduced by treatment with IL-1ra. [15] IL-1 synergises with the colony stimulating factors (CSFs), IL-3 and IL-6 to regulate the cell cycle and induce lineage-specific and multi-lineage commitment by bone marrow progenitor cells. [16] The effect of IL-1 on immunocompetent cells is that of a cytokine helper. [6] IL-1 amplifies T cell activation by inducing IL-2 and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) gene expression. [17] Induction of IL-6 (B cell growth factor-2) and proliferation of thymic epithelium are further actions. IL-1 stimulates normal cell and neoplastic cell proliferation. [18] Keratinocytes, mesangial cells, smooth muscle cells and various tumour cells also use IL-1 as a growth factor. [6] IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 both up-regulate various cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), with implications for the extravasation of cells and metastasis. [6, 18] IL-1ra inhibits the inflammatory effects of IL-1. [8] Intracerebral injection of IL-1ra in mice, for example, completely blocks the pyrogenic effects of a subsequent IL-1 injection. [19] ",

            "text": "Of several known endogenous pyrogenic cytokines, IL-6 correlates most closely with the degree of fever. [6] This pleiotropic cytokine is produced by various immune cells [such as T and B lympho-cytes, natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes] and nonimmune cells (such as smooth muscle cells, chondrocytes, astrocytes and glial cells). It is a glycoprotein of 20 to 30kD molecular mass, depending on its cellular source and method of preparation. [20, 21] Various forms of IL-6 have differing biological activities. [21] Cells that express IL-6 receptors include hepatocytes, B cells, T cells, partially committed bone marrow cells, osteocytes and various tumour cell lines. [22] Arguably, the most important effects of IL-6 are upon hepatocytes, B cells and the mononuclear phagocytes responsible for the production of IL-1 and TNF. [23] IL-6 is among the most potent mediators of the acute phase response. Other mediators include IL-1, TNF, IL-11, LIF, and oncostatin M. [20, 24] The acute phase response is an evolutionarily well conserved cascade of reactions. It is initiated by stressors such as tissue damage, inflammation and heavy exercise. Its objectives are to prevent further damage and activate repair processes. Acute phase proteins synthesised mainly by the liver include serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein. [25] IL-6 enhances ACTH production in the anterior pituitary gland, signalling the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids. [20] The glucocorticoids, in turn, potentiate the effects of IL-6 (and other cytokines) upon hepatocytes. Negative feedback is provided by the inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on macrophages. This further down-regulates the production of IL-6, thus limiting a potentially dangerous positive feedback loop. [24] The effects of IL-6 on megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis are well established. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate that IL-6 can act alone or synergise with IL-3 to enhance proliferation of haemopoietic progenitor cells partially or fully committed to the megakaryocytic lineage. [20] Administration of IL-6, either alone or in concert with IL-3, induces a dose-dependent increase in platelet count. [26] IL-6 also functions as a co-stimulatory factor for antigen-or mitogen-induced T cell activation, and is a final maturational requirement for B cells. [27, 28] IL-6 further plays key roles in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. [29] Finally, it tends to induce bone resorption by selectively activating osteoclasts, a role it shares with other pro-inflammatory cytokines. [29] Although IL-6 is generally regarded as a proinflammatory cytokine, it can play a contrary role. For example, in cancer patients, IL-6 induces the production and release of TNF binding proteins (TNF-BPs) and IL-1ra, thereby buffering the harsh effects of other indisputably pro-inflammatory cytokines. [30] Furthermore, signal transduction through the 130kD glycoprotein receptor subunit gp130 is shared by various cytokines, including the antiinflammatory IL-11, suggesting a similarity in downstream events.

Metalloproteinase inhibition can block TNF\u03b1 secretion in vivo, suggesting that inflammation is closely regulated by the body. [33] Most cells express TNF receptors.

[40] It also up-regulates the expression of ICAMs on activated macrophages, thereby contributing to cellular extravasation. [41] It is released by T helper 1 (T H1 ) cells and is a potent inhibitor of the T H2 humoral immune pathway. [38] NK cell activity is also strongly augmented by IFN\u03b3 in a dose-dependent manner, and it increases the sensitivity of tumour cells to NK cells. [42] [43] [44] IFN\u03b3 is considered a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in part because it augments the synthesis of other inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, and in part because it up-regulates expression of the TNF receptors. [45] Another pro-inflammatory role of IFN\u03b3 is the induction of at least one form of NO synthase. [46] IFN\u03b3 increases resistance to experimentally induced viral infections, as well as playing a potential role in recovery from infection. [47] Some have explained this phenomenon by implicating IFN\u03b3 in an up-regulation of expression of both class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. [38] IFN\u03b3 also acts directly, by inhibiting viral replication and it serves as an antineoplastic agent. [38] Anti-inflammatory properties may be limited to IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2. [40] ",

            "text": "IL-2 is included in this section because of its ability to activate lymphocyte subsets of both the innate and adaptive immune branches, its indirect roles in the inflammatory process, and its relevance to the various inducers of inflammation to be described. [48] It is a glycosylated 133-amino-acid protein produced exclusively by T cells. [49] Three IL-2R subunits exist. The IL-2R\u03b1 chain has a low affinity for IL-2, with a dissociation constant (K d ) of 10 -8 mol/L, until it joins with the IL-2R\u03b2 chain to form an intermediate affinity complex (K d 10 -9 mol/L). Formation of the high affinity receptor requires complexing of the intermediate affinity receptor with the \u03b3 chain; the heterotrimer has a K d of 10 -11 mol/L. [5] Soluble IL-2R (sIL-2R; \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits) attenuate the signal provided by IL-2. [50, 51] IL-2 activates resting T lymphocytes upon mitogen or antigen stimulation. The cytokine acts on T cells in an autocrine or juxtacrine manner. [51, 52] Small (naive) T cells strongly express the IL-2R\u03b1 chain, but coexpression of \u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor subunits occurs in only 1 to 6% of resting T cells. [53] Upon activation with mitogen or antigen, both IL-2R\u03b1 and IL-2R\u03b2 become strongly expressed on T lymphocytes. IL-2 induces NK cells to become lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells. NK cells are a distinct population of CD3e -16 +/-56 + lym-phocytes that do not rearrange or express the T cell receptor gene; they mediate major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted cytotoxicity against a variety of tumour and virus-infected cells. [54] Both CD3e -16 -56 + and CD3e -16 + 56 + cells express IL-2R\u03b2 constitutively at low levels, but only the CD16subset constitutively expresses the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor. [54, 55] This subset responds preferentially to lower concentrations of IL-2 with increased cytolytic activity and proliferation. Monocytes and macrophages express IL-2R\u03b2 constitutively at low levels, and they can be induced to express the IL-2R\u03b1 receptor subunit upon mitogen stimulation. [56] IL-2 induces proliferation of receptive monocytes, and it also stimulates growth and differentiation of B cells. [57] IL-15 shares many biological activities with IL-2. Synthesis is primarily by monocytes/macrophages, and unlike IL-2, it is not produced by lymphocytes. [58] The 2 cytokines use common receptor components, but have some distinct actions. For example, like IL-2, IL-15 stimulates B cell expansion, antibody production and proliferation of T and NK cells, but its effects on resting T cells are negligible unless exogenous IL-12 is added.

            "text": "Inflammation evolved both to protect the organism against infection and injury, and to promote tissue repair. Initially, effector cells are attracted to injured tissue spaces by chemokines produced by intrinsic cells. The next stage involves tissue destruction mediated by the infiltrating cells, with clearance of the damaged tissue. Finally, inflammation subsides, leaving some scar tissue, but allowing a restoration of normal structure and function. Each stage of this process is tightly regulated. The antiinflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and perhaps IL-6) attenuate inflammation by restricting inflammatory cytokine production, up-regulating their soluble antagonist binding proteins, and suppressing inflammatory cell activity. [64] The biological effects of IL-4 are mediated through a dimeric receptor found on most cells of haemopoietic lineage. [65] The cytokine is produced by T H2 lymphocytes, among other cells. It functions to facilitate humoral immunity and inhibits T H1 cells. IL-4 decreases antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity and other aspects of macrophage function by attenuating the surface expression of Fc receptors (FcR\u03b3I, FcR\u03b3II and FcR\u03b3III). [64] IL-4 decreases production of IL-1\u03b2, while increasing IL-1ra synthesis. Furthermore, IL-4 induces the cell surface expression and circulatory release of the IL-1 receptor decoy IL-1Rt2; this molecule binds extracellular IL-1 and reduces the synthesis of chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1, but it transduces no signal. [66] IL-4 also reduces the production of NO and reactive oxygen species. [67] IL-13 is a close structural homologue of IL-4, and it shares some components of the IL-4 receptor upon binding. There is a homology of function for all biological activities on macrophages and neutrophils, but IL-13 has no effect on T H cell proliferation. [64, 68, 69] Although IL-6 has some of the properties of a pro-inflammatory mediator (see section 1.1.2), it does not prime vascular endothelium for extravasation of leucocytes, nor does it activate neutrophils or macrophages as do IL-1 and TNF. [64] Several authors have appreciated the anti-inflammatory characteristics of IL-6. [30, 64] Its biological activities include stimulation of ACTH release and subsequent elaboration of cortisol (a general antiinflammatory mediator), with suppression of IL-1 and TNF synthesis by macrophages and neutrophils. [70] IL-6 also attenuates the IL-1 signal by inducing synthesis of IL-1ra and IL-1Rt2, and by promoting the release of these proteins. Overlapping the function of IL-4 and IL-13, IL-6 causes a diminished production of reactive oxygen species and shortlived nitrogenous intermediates, as well as reducing the synthesis of chemokines. [30, 64, 71] IL-10, like IL-4 and IL-13, is produced mainly by the T H2 subset of T cells. It is also secreted by macrophages, mast cells and B cells, and is strongly implicated in immunosuppression. [64, 71] IL-1 and TNF are potent activators of IL-10 synthesis, thereby inducing a negative feedback mechanism. The antiinflammatory actions of IL-10 include inhibiting synthesis of the pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), TNF, IL-8 and IL-12. [64] IL-10 induces macrophages to diminish their NO production, and it inhibits production of IFN\u03b3 by T cells and NK cells, thereby retarding development of cell-mediated inflammation. [72] IL-10 also promotes proliferation of B cells and mast cells, and it acts on monocytes to induce production of IL-1ra and the soluble TNF p55 receptor. [73, 74] ",

[75] 2.1 Effects of Short Term Physical Activity on the Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines Studies examining cytokine production in the context of prolonged bouts of deliberate endurance exercise are most common, but additional insights have been gained from other forms of short term physical activity such as near maximal/short duration exercise, anaerobic exercise and concentric and eccentric activity. The response differs appreciably with the mode of exercise, [76] [77] [78] [79] the availability of carbohydrate [79] and core temperature. [80] Until recently, the source of the activity-induced increase in serum cytokine levels remained speculative. Bruunsgaard et al. [78] found messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-6 in exercising muscle, but not in the blood. Moldoveanu et al. [81] also found no change of mRNA levels for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in circulating cells in response to 3 hours of moderate endurance exercise. However, flow cytometry has now demonstrated that an increased percentage of circulating monocytes express pro-inflammatory cytokines intracellularly during and immediately following vigorous exercise, [82] suggesting that these cells are at least one source of the cytokines. Table I summarises the effects of exercise on some of the pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

In consequence, results are inconsistent. [2] Northoff et al. [112] found modest increases of IL-1 following exercise, with an associated increase in urinary excretion. Moldoveanu et al. [81] had individuals exercise for 3 hours at 60 to 65% of maximal oxygen intake (V . O 2max ); they noted a significant increase of IL-1 at 60 minutes, with a further increase at 180 minutes; values remained above initial levels for 24 hours following exercise. Ostrowski et al. [113] also saw a 2.1-fold increase of IL-1\u03b2 in the first hour after running a marathon race. On the other hand, Suzuki et al. [93] found no increase of IL-1\u03b2 following a marathon run. Bruunsgaard et al. [78] used an eccentric exercise protocol consisting of 30 minutes of maximal and supramaximalequivalent cycle ergometry in an attempt to investigate the effects of such stimuli on circulatory IL-1\u03b2. However, plasma IL-1\u03b2 levels as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) remained below the detection threshold for all sampling time-points. Ullum et al. [88] studied IL-1\u03b2 gene expression in 17 healthy, moderately trained males in response to 60 minutes of cycle ergometry at 75% of each individual's V . O 2max . Using nuclear run-off analysis, they noted no change in pre-mRNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before, during or after exercise. In accordance with this observation, Natelson et al. [90] observed no change in PBMC RNA levels of either IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 after a staged walk exercise bout that progressed in speed and inclination for 46 minutes, to the point of voluntary exhaustion. Cannon et al. [86] investigated the intramuscular IL-1\u03b2 level in 5 healthy males. Eccentric exercise was achieved by running downhill on a 16% treadmill slope for 45 minutes at a speed demanding 75% of the individuals' concentric V",

Muscle biopsies were stained immunohistochemically with rabbit antisera raised against human IL-1\u03b2, and the investigators also used a T cell proliferation (inducible by IL-1\u03b2) bioassay. Intramuscular IL-1\u03b2 concentrations were increased at 45 minutes and 5 days after exercise. Although observations of IL-1 protein production in response to exercise appear inconsistent with unchanged IL-1 gene expression, extracellular cytokine release is not always secondary to the immediate gene expression of a given cytokine. Mast cells, for example, store TNF\u03b1 until they degranulate. [114] Thus, sources of IL-1 such as the mononuclear phagocytes may be storing IL-1 intracellularly before its extracellular release.",

[92] observed that 48 hours of stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (40 mg/ml) increased the concentration of nonexercised PBMC supernatant IL-1 to 27.4 units/ml and that of exercised PBMCs to 48.7 units/ml. Moyna et al. [115] increased the cycle ergometer loading every 6 minutes in highly trained cyclists (32 males and 32 females). Consecutive stages of exercise amounted to 55%, 70% and 85% of the individual's V . O 2max . Lipopolysaccharideinduced in vitro IL-1\u03b2 production (ELISA methodology) increased throughout the 18 minutes of exercise, but had returned to baseline 2 hours after exercise. Haahr et al. [83] measured unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 production, using the ELISA method and a thymocyte proliferation bioassay. Both techniques showed that 2 hours after 60 minutes of 75% V . O 2max cycle ergometry, lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1 production was augmented. In apparent conflict with these results, Weinstock et al. [94] demonstrated that 68 minutes of competition-intensity triathlon exercise decreased the ability of stimulated whole blood cultures to produce IL-1\u03b2. However, this study did not account for the possible effects of competitive stress on cytokine production.",

Urine concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 increased about 1.8-fold relative to before exercise, and values remained high for at least 24 hours following exercise. Bury et al. [96] had 7 healthy males exercise for 4 hours at 45% V . O 2max , 3 hours at 60% V . O 2max , and 2 hours at 75% V . O 2max , each bout of exercise being separated by enough time to preclude a cumulative training effect. With each of these protocols, IL-1 levels were significantly elevated, both immediately following exercise and 60 minutes after its termination. The magnitude of the increase depended on the intensity rather than the duration of exercise. Many other observers have found that IL-1\u03b2 production is unaffected by exercise unless the blood is stimulated. [110, 116, 117] It appears that although exercise alone may induce a limited output of IL-1, subsequent mitogenic stimulation allows investigators to amplify the effects of exercise, with implications not only for detection of this cytokine, but also for immune activation by exercise. IL-1 release depends on the type of exercise performed, its intensity and, to a lesser degree, the duration of exercise. IL-1 is among the first cytokines to be released in response to exercise stress.",

Northoff et al. [119] used a bioassay to semi-quantify plasma IL-6 concentrations in long-distance runners.

Unfortunately, although the proliferative bioassay used in this early study was sensitive to IL-6, it was not proven to be insensitive to IL-7. Nehlsen-Cannarella et al.

Plasma IL-6 peaked twice: once at the end of the high intensity exercise, and once 20 minutes after exercise. Heterogeneous studies thus point to the conclusion that circulatory concentrations of IL-6 are elevated rapidly but transiently in response to various types, durations and intensities of exercise. Tissue damage has been implicated in the induction of blood-borne and tissue IL-6. [78, 89] Natelson et al. [90] used their aforementioned graded exercise protocol to induce temporary exhaustion; IL-6 RNA expression was unchanged by this exercise. Likewise, neither Ullum et al. [88] nor Moldoveanu et al. [81] found any up-regulation of IL-6 gene expression in mononuclear cells response to exercise. However, as discussed for IL-1\u03b2, flow cytometry shows increased intracellular levels of IL-6, [82] and circulatory release does not necessarily depend on immediate induction of cytokine gene expression. [114, 120, 121] For this reason, there is a need for further studies relating the kinetics of cytokine appearance to the intracellular concentrations found in various tissue compartments. cause they collected samples immediately following the event. Most other investigators have found that prolonged endurance exercise induces TNF release into the plasma. Rokitzki et al. [105] detected increased TNF\u03b1 levels in the plasma of 14 endurance-trained athletes immediately following a marathon run. Dufaux and Order [106] followed the kinetics of plasma TNF\u03b1 in 8 male sports students after a 2.5-hour run. Peak levels of this cytokine were reached 60 minutes after the end of the race (the only statistically significantly difference), but concentrations had fallen below initial control values 120 minutes after the end of the race. In accordance with this observation, Ostrowski et al. [85] showed a 2.5-fold increase in plasma TNF\u03b1 levels immediately after 2.5 hours of treadmill running at moderate-to-high intensity.",

Likewise, Moldoveanu et al. [81] observed a 90% increase of plasma TNF\u03b1 following 3 hours of endurance exercise at 60 to 65% of V . O 2max ; this abated gradually over the following 24 hours. However, no significant changes were induced by 5 minutes at 90% of V . O 2max , or by an exhausting circuit training routine. Sprenger and associates [95] found that the urinary excretion of TNF\u03b1 was elevated immediately after a 20km run, but the effect was transient; levels became normal 1 or more days after the run. Espersen et al. [107] similarly found that a 5km race was sufficient to elevate plasma TNF\u03b1 levels immediately after effort. Rivier et al. [100] investigated TNF\u03b1 production by blood monocytes in terms of translated and secreted protein. Combined data from masters athletes and younger individuals indicated a nonsignificant trend for monocyte TNF release to increase immediately after exercise, but in their participants there was a decrease below baseline during the postexercise recovery period. Further evidence that exercise may attenuate monocyte TNF production comes from the work of Bagby et al. [109] They investigated the effect of exhaustive running-wheel exercise on the TNF response of rats to lipopolysaccharide (1 mg/kg body mass). Exercise severely depressed the circulatory TNF\u03b1 response for up to 3 hours after exercise. Moreover, heart rate and blood pressure nadirs correlated with TNF\u03b1 concentrations, recapitulating the effects of stress-activated TNF\u03b1 on the myocardium and vasculature. [122] Baum et al. [108] noted that 90 minutes of exhaustive exercise decreased the release of TNF\u03b1 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated whole blood. Exercise, therefore, appears to have different effects on the production of IL-1 and TNF by immune cells; it tends to magnify the IL-1 response to lipopolysaccharide, but it can reduce that to TNF. This is surprising, given the close association of these 2 cytokines in pathophysiological contexts such as general inflammation. Divergent results in studies focusing on TNF may be explicable by inconsistencies in experimental design. In vivo or in vitro administration of glucocorticoids suppresses the lipopolysaccharideinduced release of TNF\u03b1 by blood monocytes. [123] It is though that elevated glucocorticoid levels suppress the effect of exercise on circulatory TNF, and it may be instructive to test this hypothesis in adrenalectomised animals. [123] In humans, investigation of the dependency of TNF on cortisol levels may be enlightening, as would be protocols designed to account for or eliminate the glucocorticoid stress response.",

Adecrease in IFN\u03b3 response to mitogenic stimulation, and thus lower plasma concentrations of this cytokine has been suggested as contributing to an 'open window' for infections following exercise.

            "text": "Most studies show that exercise impairs the ability of mitogenically stimulated lymphocytes to produce IL-2. Data on unstimulated cells are more divergent (table II) . Rhind et al. [124] reported that 60 minutes of exercise at 60% V . O 2max decreased culture supernatant IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated PBMC; no IL-2 production was detected in unstimulated cells. The [ 3 H]thymidine incorporation of PHA-stimulated cells, indicative of DNA synthesis, was also reduced by exercise. Administration of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) enhanced PHAstimulated cell growth, but did not reverse the exercise-induced suppression of mitogen responsiveness. However, exercise made the cells more responsive to rIL-2 administration, an observation explicable by changes in soluble and cell surface IL-2R. In agreement with these data, Lewicki et al. [92] showed that when 11 trained men were exercised incrementally to exhaustion (over a mean time of 20 minutes), the PHA-stimulated IL-2 release of PBMC was diminished by 27% immediately after exercise and suppression was even greater 2 hours after exercise. Espersen et al. [107] were able to measure plasma IL-2 levels. They found no change immediately after exercise, but plasma IL-2 levels had increased significantly over baseline 24 hours after exercise. Animal studies on splenocyte IL-2 production generally have used concanavalin-A (Con-A) stimulation, but results have failed to agree with each other. Studies investigating cell surface IL-2R have looked at one or more of the 3 receptor subunits, whereas measurements of sIL-2R have usually been made on IL-2R\u03b1 (table II) . Rhind et al. [124] demonstrated that serum IL-2R levels were elevated significantly immediately after exercise, and peaked 60 minutes after cessation of physical activity. The IL-2R\u03b1 (CD25) and IL-2R\u03b2 (CD122) subunits of IL-2R were transiently up-regulated on the lymphocyte cell surface during exercise. Possibly, this could account for the increased proliferation in response to rIL-2 in lymphocytes taken from individuals who had exercised. The CD25 + (IL-2R\u03b1 +) and CD122 + (IL-2R\u03b2 + ) phenotypes diminished to normal levels within 30 minutes of recovery. [124] Dufaux and Order [106] showed a more prolonged increase in sIL-2R levels in response to a 2.5-hour run. Levels rose during the first 24 hours of recovery, although increments only became statistically significant at 24 and 48 hours of sampling. Lewicki et al. [92] showed that after incremental exercise to exhaustion, PHA stimulation of PBMC resulted in a 23% decreased expression of CD25, whereas the CD25 expression of unstimulated cells increased 3-fold in response to exercise. Sprenger et al. [95] noted that under cold conditions, a 20km run last-ing 95 to 120 minutes doubled urinary excretion of sIL-2R.",

On the other hand, reproducible decreases in the ability of PBMC to respond to polyclonal stimulation by synthesising IL-2 implies that exercise suppresses some aspects of cellmediated immunity. Further work is needed to determine more holistically the effects of exercise on cell-mediated immune function through modulation of IL-2 and its receptor subunits.",

Plasma IL-8 measurements remained below the detection threshold before, during and after exercise, suggesting that some other factor had altered pulmonary diffusion capacity. Hopkins et al.

            "text": "IL-10 has been implicated by many investigators as effecting the immunosuppression associated with various forms of trauma, including exercise. [3, 138] Brenner et al. [76] had untrained males exercise using 3 different protocols. Neither 2 hours of cycle ergometry at 65% of peak aerobic power nor 45 minutes of intermittent resistance exercise had any impact on plasma IL-10 concentration. However, 5 minutes of intense exercise (90% of V . O 2max ) decreased plasma IL-10 concentrations 3, 24 and 72 hours after exercise, although the change was small and its biological significance is likely to have been negligible. [138] Gannon et al. [101, 102] found no measurable increase in IL-10 following 6 hours of competitive cycling, but Suzuki et al. [93] found a 3.4-fold increase in plasma IL-10 immediately following a marathon run, and Anwar et al. [91] found that serum IL-10 was elevated significantly 48 and 72 hours after strenuous eccentric exercise. Changes in de novo gene expression of IL-10 may not be responsible for any changes in circulating IL-10, at least after short, near-maximal exercise. Natelson et al. [90] found that peripheral blood leucocyte RNA levels of IL-10 were unchanged after a maximal treadmill stress test. Although IL-10 is greatly affected by other forms of trauma, it remains to be determined how far exercise-induced changes in concentrations of this cytokine are physiologically relevant. The appearance of IL-10 after eccentric exercise may indicate that IL-10 release is secondary to tissue damage.",

IL-2 and its receptor subunits have been afforded unrepresentative attention. The observation that aging has a suppressant effect on cellular immune function has prompted training studies in the elderly. These have focused in part on the cytokine response, in the hope of developing strategies for counteracting immunosenescence. [143] Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have also investigated the effects of training on the cytokines that mediate inflammation. As cytokines modulate cell-mediated immunity directly, determining the immune and nonimmune cellular response to training has allowed an indirect insight into the cytokine response and adaptation to long term physical activity. The effects of training on humoral immunity are beyond the scope of this review, but the effect of training on cytokines supportive of humoral function has received little study to date.",

[149] investigated the effects of 12 weeks of strength training on cytokine responses in the young, the elderly and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Twice weekly exercise bouts comprised 3 sets of 8 repetitions of 1 repetition maximum (RM) contractions. There were no changes in IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-2 or prostaglandin production. However, the duration of the stimulus for adaptation as well as the exercise modality employed may have been inappropriate to induce the desired changes. Several other studies have investigated the difference in T cell function between sedentary and aerobically conditioned elderly individuals. [140] Both NK cell activity (measured in lytic units) and lymphocyte proliferation in response to PHA have generally been higher among highly conditioned individuals. These studies have used aerobically trained rather than strength-trained athletes. Shinkai et al. [143] compared the resting immune function of 17 elderly male runners (mean age 63.8 years) with 16 young (mean age 23.6 years) and 19 sedentary elderly (mean age 65.8 years) individuals. The active elderly individuals had an average aerobic power that was 33% greater than that of sedentary controls. They retained superior T cell proliferative responses to pokeweed mitogen and PHA, as well as a stronger production of IL-2, IFN\u03b3 and IL-4. Animal studies generally support these observations. Hoffman-Goetz and Sweeny [151] determined the effects of 8 weeks of voluntary wheel running in female, outbred Swiss Webster mice. NK/LAK activity against YAC-1 tumour cell targets was significantly higher in physically active animals compared with those not given access to a running wheel. However, it remained unclear whether the increased cytolytic activity was attributable to increased IL-1 or IL-2 production by the active animals. Nasrullah and Mazzeo [125] demonstrated that 15 weeks of aerobic training improved the T cell proliferative response of elderly rats, and augmented their ability to produce IL-2.",

Furthermore, data on the source of cytokines must be synthesised in the hope of developing endogenous and exogenous intervention and modulation strategies.

In this study, [172] muscle damage was defined as an infiltration of fibres with mononuclear cells, the formation of multiple nuclei, or obvious swelling on histological examination. Clarkson et al. [160] proposed that the immediate loss of strength associated with eccentric exercise may be caused by the overstretching of sarcomeres. A decrease in overlap between actin and myosin filaments reduces sustainable contractile force and predisposes to damage. In support of this hypothesis, Newham and Ghosh [173] found that strength losses were greater if eccentric exercise was performed close to the extended extremity of the range of a muscle than if it was performed near to its contracted extremity. Armstrong et al. [158] reported that disruptions in the striation patterns of slow twitch rat extensor muscles were seen immediately following eccentric running.",

Infiltration by activated immune cells is positively correlated with the extent of tissue damage, and some studies have demonstrated increased phagocytic cell oxidative activity in response to short term exercise. [1] Vindenes et al. [157] found that despite up-regulation of the chemokine IL-8, thermal injury did not change mouse phagocyte function, as indicated by the migration of cells from the circulation into the tissues. However, Cetinkale et al. [167] found increased malondialdehyde levels in blood taken 24 hours after severe thermal injury, indicating increased oxidative stress. The authors concluded that both direct thermal injury and immune cell oxidative processes contributed to increased lipid peroxidation. Battal et al. [169] studied the blocking of endothelin-A and -B activity during thermal injury. Endothelins potentiate the effect of local thrombosis to the point of occluding the microcirculation adjacent to a burn, causing necrotic damage of otherwise unaffected tissue. Exogenous antagonists to the endothelin receptors reduce the extent of tissue damage following burns.",

[175] Major surgical interventions also cause vast tissue disruption, but macrophage and neutrophil activation causes less secondary tissue microtrauma than in the case of exercise. Infection often exacerbates tissue damage following thermal injury or surgery, triggering the action of innate and adaptive immune cells. [176] In the absence of infection, innate immune cell function is directed toward restoration of normal function in the vicinity of injury. Phagocytosis and coagulatory mechanisms clean up detritus and sterilise the area, this stage being followed by angiogenesis and functional restoration of native tissue. [138] Neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages play an important role. Neutrophils normally have a circulatory life span of approximately 6 days, but during sepsis they are rescued from apoptosis by cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, as well as by circulatory indicators of sepsis such as lipopolysaccharide. [164] The survival of monocytes in human blood is also increased by lipopolysaccharide, but the more differentiated macrophages show a fragmentation of genomic DNA. This indicates apoptosis, and it makes data on these cell populations difficult to interpret in relation to the tissue damage induced by sepsis. [164] Bliff et al. [165] speculated that the increased lifespan of monocytes, coupled with a greater chemokine stimulus for extravasation, could cause greater exposure to activated immune cells and potentially more oxidative damage of otherwise healthy tissue.",

Although adequate levels of NO production are necessary to preserve perfusion and carry out cytoprotective functions, overproduction contributes to haemodynamic instability and tissue damage. [166] NO is the main mediator of vasodilatation and the hyperdynamic circulation seen in sepsis, which along with tissue damage, causes multiple organ failure. The restoration of perfusion pressure is thus a major therapeutic goal in pre-venting further tissue damage. The TNF\u03b1 produced by monocytes and macrophages in response to microbial products, including endotoxin, is a potent primer of neutrophil oxidative activity.",

Table IV summarises the direct and latent tissue damage induced by physical activity, trauma and sepsis. The infiltration of muscle tissue by phagocytic cells during and after exercise may serve an adaptive and restorative role, rather than fostering an inappropriate immune autoreaction. In some models such as ischaemia/reperfusion, neutrophils can damage muscle tissue directly, but evidence of such damage in muscle tissue after physical activity is still inconclusive. [174] Although macrophages are present in human skeletal muscle both at rest and during exercise, their function is as yet unknown. To establish conclusively whether local phagocytic cells are responsible for the latent tissue damage observed after exercise, it will be necessary to compare intramuscular phagocyte function before and after exercise. It is possible that macrophages mainly mediate muscle rebuilding and hypertrophy. [174] Their presence seems a requirement for regeneration of skeletal muscle tissue; specialised macrophage subpopulations infiltrate muscle tissue during different stages of the recovery process.

Several studies have evaluated the appropriateness of exercise-induced muscle damage as a model of inflammation. [1] Bruunsgaard et al. [78] studied the cytokine response to 30 minutes of eccentric (resisted) cycle ergometry, finding that muscle damage was required to increase plasma IL-6 levels; neither injury nor increased IL-6 were seen in concentric exercise. However, creatine kinase levels did not peak until well after the appearance of IL-6, indicating that IL-6 is more rapidly induced than the usually accepted indicator of muscle damage, creatine kinase. Cannon and colleagues [86] found that IL-1\u03b2 protein was elevated in the muscle tissue of individuals who performed 45 minutes of downhill running, although samples were evaluated for relative IL-1\u03b2 staining intensity only 45 minutes and 5 days after exercise, and no data were obtained on the kinetics of IL-1\u03b2 production in between these time points. Fielding et al. [84] used a comparable protocol to evaluate the immunohistochemical staining of intramuscular IL-1\u03b2. They found a 135% increase immediately after exercise and a 250% increase 5 days after exercise. The handful of experiments investigating the cytokine response to eccentric exercise point to a promising model of tissue damage and inflammation, but more work is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this mode of exercise in mimicking the responses observed in subclinical inflammation.",

O 2max ) was most closely representative of the subclinical inflammatory response. In this study, prolonged exercise induced a transient rise in IL-6 that peaked 3 hours after exercise, but circulating TNF\u03b1 levels increased slowly for 72 hours and may still have been climbing at the last sampling point. The modest extent of the exerciseinduced increase in cytokine concentration brings into question the physiological significance of such slight responses. In this study, modulation of IL-10 was observed only after brief, intense exercise, in response to which circulatory IL-10 was reduced slightly but significantly. Therefore, the induction of tissue damage may not be of primary importance in using exercise as a model of the inflammatory response.",

Cytokine responses to lethal and sublethal sepsis begin with the rapid circulatory appearance of TNF\u03b1; within 60 minutes, concentrations increase many hundred-fold. [152] This response is followed closely by that of IL-6, which may increase many thousand-fold. [152, 189, 198] Circulatory IL-1\u03b2 rises in response to infection, with the extent of the response depending on the severity of infection. It may be up-regulated by TNF\u03b1, whereas the chemokine IL-8 seems to follow the kinetics of IL-6. [152, 189] In severe cases, the anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ra and IL-10 have negligible physiological significance compared with the onslaught of the pro-inflammatory mediators. [152] For example, in a murine lethal endotoxin challenge model, Napolitano et al.

            "text": "Symptomatologically, the disease state correlates well with transient peaks of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in most forms of inflammation. Depending on the magnitude of response, the inflammatory state is either resolved or ends terminally. Thermal injury and physical trauma are more difficult to characterise because of the incomparability of implemented experimental designs. The proinflammatory cytokines seem to be up-regulated by trauma, but significant immunosuppression is also induced by other soluble mediators such as IL-4 and IL-10. [177] Although the cytokine response to heavy physical activity superficially resembles that accompanying trauma and infection, mechanisms may be very different, and typically there are marked differences in symptomatology. In most cases the cytokine response even to sublethal sepsis differs by several orders of magnitude, making it difficult to use one condition as a model of the other. Even the heaviest forms of physical activity induce only mild cytokine alterations when compared with sepsis. Moreover, ethical considerations preclude the implementation (in humans) of protocols that are punishing enough to elicit significant tissue damage. Distinctions abound: for example, sepsis depresses myocardial function, whereas physical activity usually does not. [122, 201] However, physical activity induces endogenous pyrogenic activity in human blood, implying that changes in cytokine levels or their reception mimic, to some degree, the changes observed in inflammation. [202] Tissue damage induced by exercise is repaired within a few days and usually results in a positive adaptation to the stimulus. Immune cells responsible for cytokine production play mainly a restorative role after exercise, whereas after physical trauma and infection, innate and specific immune cells exhibit a more aggressive response. [174] Differences in cytokine profiles induced by these var-ious forms of trauma indicate that even the most severe levels of physical activity offer at best a scaled model of the inflammatory response in pathological states. The response to exercise is not entirely comparable to the immune activation observed during physical trauma and infection. However, both short term exercise and training affect immune function and effect immune adaptation, so that exercise immunology is important in its own right. The handful of experiments on training and immune function performed to date indicate that exercise may have a beneficial impact on cellular immune function, particularly in the elderly.",

Very little attention has been directed to the haemopoietic cytokines, such as IL-3, the c-kit ligand [stem cell factor (SCF)] IL-5, or IL-7 and IL-14, the B cell growth and differentiation factors. [137, 203] Investigation of IL-5 may be important, considering its ability to regulate eosinophil function. [204, 205] The elusive pleiotropic growth factor IL-9 has also received very little attention by exercise immunologists. [206] The effects of short and long term exercise on newly discovered cytokines require elucidation, and findings need to be contrasted with the modulation of these soluble mediators by other inducers of inflammation. Provocative results on exercise modulation of IL-2 and its receptor dictate the need for further study of its close functional relative, IL-15, considering both the overlap of properties with IL-2, and its resistance to down-regulation by IL-4, IL-13, transforming growth factor \u03b2 and IL-10. [58] Regulation of the newly characterised chemokine IL-16 and other well known chemokines such as RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) need investigation in the context of physical activity and the general inflammatory response. [48, 60, 207] The responses to exercise, trauma and infection of the T cell-derived IL-17, which induces the production of pro-inflammatory and haemopoietic cytokines, as well as the IFN\u03b3-inducing factor, IL-18, may also be revealing. [208] [209] [210] LIF, a pleiotropic cytokine with seemingly unrelated effects on several cell types such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, and neural cells, should also be investigated in the context of inflammation. [211] Unfortunately, efforts to quantify the response of some of the 'newer' cytokines will be limited to laboratories capable of designing quantification protocols de novo, as, to date, there are no commercially available reagents with which to pursue this endeavour.",

In quantifying gene expression, it is necessary to establish not only the change in transcript level, but also the level of transcript stability.

[1] The cytokines merit investigation because, unlike soluble endocrine mediators, they generally exhibit biological potency in the nano-to picomolar concentration range, and they have a potential for powerful modulation by stimuli such as infection and exercise. Similarities in cytokine response to infection and exercise have focused on the appropriateness of physical activity as a model for various forms of injury and inducers of inflammation. Future research should determine how far these striking similarities hold under close scrutiny. Resemblances may turn out to be superficial and limited to the cytokines studied thus far. Considering the uniqueness of most biological response equilibria, and the differences in pathophysiology and outcome between exercise-induced and other forms of inflammation, it seems likely that future studies will emphasise the distinctiveness of the cytokine response to physical activity. There are clearly qualitative differences in the way the body responds to exercise and the way it reacts to trauma and infection. However, this is not surprising, considering the difference in type and magnitude of the respective stimuli.",
