However, contradictory results have also been presented, and the mechanistic explanation is lacking. Methods: A panel of cell lines (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), lung epithelial type I (LET1)) and primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) susceptible to influenza virus infection were infected with a seasonal influenza A virus in the presence or absence of BBR. Cytotoxicity towards cell lines was measured using XTT assay. The yield of the virus was analyzed using RT-qPCR. To study the molecular mechanism of BBR, confocal microscopy and Western blot analyses of cellular fractions were applied. Results and conclusions: Our results show cell-type-dependent anti-influenza properties of BBR in vitro which suggests that the compound acts on the cell and not the virus. Importantly, BBR hampers influenza replication in primary human airway epithelium 3D cultures that mimic the natural replication site of the virus. Studies show that the influenza A virus upregulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and hijacks this pathway for nucleolar export of the viral ribonucleoprotein. Our results suggest that BBR interferes with this process and hampers influenza A replication.",

Then, NP-40 was added to reach 0.1% v/v concentration and samples were incubated for 5 min. After centrifugation (600\u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C), the cytoplasmic fraction was collected. Then, nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B: 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 20% glycerol. After 30 min on ice, nuclei were subjected to three cycles of snap-freeze/thaw, and insoluble proteins were removed from the nuclear extract by high-speed centrifugation at 4 \u2022 C. Obtained fractions were mixed with sample buffer (0.5 M Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50 mg/mL dithiothreitol (DTT)), boiled for 5 min, and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels alongside dual-color PageRuler prestained protein size markers (Thermo Scientific, Warsaw, Poland).

            "text": "To investigate the antiviral activity of BBR in vitro, a series of cell lines permissive to the influenza A virus were infected in the presence of BBR (10-160 \u00b5M). First, the most common in vitro model was used, i.e., the cell line derived from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). We performed a standard virus replication assay by infecting the MDCK cells in the presence or absence of BBR. Concomitantly, cell viability was monitored using the XTT assay. A significant inhibitory effect of BBR in the MDCK cells was observed in our experimental setting in samples treated with BBR at 80 and 160 \u00b5M, while IC 50 was equal to 52 \u00b5M. We did not observe any significant decrease in cell viability (TC 50 = 1035 \u00b5M, SI = 20) ( Figure 1A , Table 1 ). These results indicate inhibitory properties similar to those obtained by Wu et al. (IC 50 = 0.025 \u00b5g/mL \u2248 67 \u00b5M). We conclude that BBR hampers replication of the influenza A virus in MDCK cells, but to a much lesser extent than in other in vitro models [19, 28] . Next, the human pulmonary tumor cell line A549 was assayed, as inhibition of the influenza virus by BBR in this cell line has been consistently reported [19, 21] . Many reports show a high toxicity of BBR to cancer cells, including the A549 cell line [29, 30] , therefore BBR has been proposed as an antineoplastic drug candidate. Considering that BBR cytotoxicity was not assayed in these cells, we decided to verify the antiviral BBR activity in A549 cells. Our results indicate a significant decrease in influenza A replication in the presence of BBR, but the compound was cytotoxic at the active concentrations (IC 50 = 17 \u00b5M, TC 50 = 107 \u00b5M, SI = 6) ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ).",

Next, we tested the effect of BBR on the replication of the influenza A virus in LET1 cells. RT-qPCR analysis revealed a vast decrease in viral replication at non-toxic concentrations (IC 50 = 4 \u00b5M, SI = 123) ( Figure 1C , Table 1 ).

However, we observed a decrease in assay V, which suggests that BBR affects virus assembly, maturation, or egress ( Figure 4) . ",

After 12 h, we observed characteristic accumulation of a viral RNP complex inside nuclei, in both cells treated with BBR and U0126 ( Figure 5A ). This effect was confirmed by image analysis. Significant differences in NP signal accumulation were observed for both the U0126 and BBR cells compared to the untreated control ( Figure 5B ). More than 90% of NP colocalized with nuclear staining in cells treated with U0126 or BBR compared to about 70% in control cells. This effect was clearly visible between 12 and 20 h p.i. After this time, large amounts of RNP were also visible in the cytoplasm (data not shown). This outcome may be due to the removal of BBR from the cell or its degradation. Western blot analyses indicate moderate inhibition of ERK1 activation by BBR at 20 \u00b5M concentration (45% inhibition) compared to the U0126 cell (76% inhibition) (Figure 6 .). We observed, however, a slight increase in the amount of phospho-ERK in control-infected cells, as previously reported [34] . To confirm confocal imaging results, we performed a similar experiment and isolated cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions for Western blot analysis. The analysis showed higher quantities (~3 fold increase) of viral NP in nuclear fractions of cells treated with U0126 or 20 \u00b5M BBR (0.007 \u00b5g/mL) compared to untreated infection, confirming our confocal imaging observations ( Figure 7B ). Lower BBR concentration, however, did not cause significant accumulation of influenza A virus NP (data not shown). In the case of cytoplasmatic fraction, we observed a moderate yet clear decrease of NP (about 40% inhibition) signal in treated cells which may suggest that BBR does not interfere with the assembly and release of virions. Taking these results together, obtained data suggest an inhibition on the influenza A virus by BBR through the downregulation of the MAPK/ERK1 pathway. Viruses 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 16 ",

            "text": "In the subsequent step, we aimed to understand the molecular mechanism of action of the BBR on the influenza A virus. Functional assays demonstrated the effect of BBR on virus replication, and not the receptor binding or virus entry. The cell-type-dependent differences in the compound antiviral activity suggested that the compound likely acts on the host cell, and not the virus itself. For this reason, we made an effort to link the known activities of BBR with pathways that are important for the replication of the influenza A virus. Two recently published reports show BBR-mediated inhibition of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and the enterovirus 71, which was caused by interference with the virus-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) [35, 36] . It is also known that the active form of ERK1 (p-ERK1) is required for the nuclear export of the influenza A virus RNP complex during the infection [37] and that this pathway is modulated during the infection. First, the ERK pathway is upregulated shortly after the infection, to rapidly decrease after the first hour [38] . Next, the pathway is upregulated again at the late stage of the infection, when RNP must be exported from the nucleus to assemble into progeny virions [37] . ERK inhibition with a specific inhibitor U0126 impairs RNP transport and results in retention of RNPs inside the nucleus, and consequent inhibition of viral replication [37] . We verified if BBR exhibited activity similar to that of U0126. Confocal microscopy revealed a similar RNP retention within the cell nuclei in both BBR-treated and MAPK/ERK inhibitor U0126-treated A549 cells ( Figure 5 ). Accumulation of the nucleoprotein was also observed when nuclear fractions of cells treated with BBR and U0126 were analyzed ( Figure 6 ). The literature does not link the specific MAPK/ERK inhibition and the activity of BBR in A549 cells [39, 40] , which suggests that the antiviral effect is specific.",

Influenza A virus stock was incubated with BBR under constant mixing for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were diluted 100 times to ensure that the BBR concentration was below the lower limit of the effective range. Samples were then titrated according to the Reed and Muench method[24]. (II) Cell protection assay examines the effect of the compound on the cell surface. In this assay, cells were incubated with BBR for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. After incubation, the media were removed, and cells were washed with PBS. Then, cells were infected with the influenza A virus (TCID 50 = 400) or mock control for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. Next, media were discarded, cells were washed thrice with PBS, and fresh infection medium was added. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 \u2022 C. (III) Virus attachment assay examines the effect of the compound on the virus-receptor interaction. Virus internalization assay for evaluation of virus entry into the susceptible cell. Pre-cooled, confluent cells were infected with a virus (TCID 50 = 400; ice-cold solution) for 2 h at 4 \u2022 C to avoid virus internalization to cells. After incubation, the medium was discarded, and cells were washed thrice with cold PBS. Then, media supplemented with BBR were applied, and samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C to allow for virus internalization. Next, cells were washed with an acidic buffer (pH 3.0; 0.1 M glycine, 0.1 M sodium chloride) to inactivate uninternalized virions.Cultures were rinsed once with PBS and fresh media were applied. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 \u2022 C. (V) Virus replication, assembly, and egress assay evaluates virus replication and production of infectious progeny.
