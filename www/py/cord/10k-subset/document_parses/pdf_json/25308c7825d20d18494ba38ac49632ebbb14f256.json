A single vaccine for Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages targeting the major sporozoite antigen circumsporozoite protein (CSP) has had partial success. Additionally, CD8+ T cells targeting liver-stage (LS) antigens induced by live attenuated sporozoite vaccines were associated with protection in human challenge experiments. To further evaluate protection mediated by LS antigens, we focused on exported pre-erythrocytic proteins (exported protein 1 (EXP1), profilin (PFN), exported protein 2 (EXP2), inhibitor of cysteine proteases (ICP), transmembrane protein 21 (TMP21), and upregulated in infective sporozoites-3 (UIS3)) expressed in all Plasmodium species and designed optimized, synthetic DNA (synDNA) immunogens. SynDNA antigen cocktails were tested with and without the molecular adjuvant plasmid IL-33. Immunized animals developed robust T cell responses including induction of antigen-specific liver-localized CD8+ T cells, which were enhanced by the co-delivery of plasmid IL-33. In total, 100% of mice in adjuvanted groups and 71%-88% in non-adjuvanted groups were protected from blood-stage disease following Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite challenge. This study supports the potential of synDNA LS antigens as vaccine components for malaria parasite infection.",

Malaria infections are caused by the Plasmodia parasite, which has a complex life cycle, with stages in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Five species of Plasmodium are infectious to humans: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium knowlesi. While P. falciparum is responsible for the majority of deaths caused by malaria, P. vivax has recently been shown to be the cause of approximately 25% of severe malaria in Southeast Asia, and multi-drug resistant P. vivax has been identified [1] . Infection in humans begins when the human is bitten by an infected female Anopheles mosquito, which inoculates sporozoites in the dermis. Sporozoites subsequently travel through the blood to invade hepatocytes. The liver-stage (LS) parasite is separated from the infected hepatocyte by a selective parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) of host hepatocyte plasma membrane origin [2, 3] . The growing LS parasite acquires nutrients from its host hepatocyte and at the same time prevents its apoptosis [4] [5] [6] [7] . Each infected hepatocyte can generate tens of thousands of merozoites, which will subsequently rupture from the liver and start the pathogenic blood stage of infection.",

CSP was and still is a main target for vaccination trials over the last several decades mainly because of the antigenicity of its domains and the sporozoite neutralizing effect of CSP-antibodies in vitro and in vivo [8, 9] . The most advanced subunit malaria vaccine is RTS,S, which is based on repeat regions of CSP coupled with Hepatitis B envelope protein and the potent AS01 adjuvant. RTS,S induces impressive CSP antibody responses, resulting in 46% vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria in children and 27% efficacy in infants in the 18 months following immunization [10] . The antibody responses significantly wane over time, as does protection [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

            "text": "The only vaccination method that has led to long-lasting complete sterile protection against malaria parasite challenges in animals and in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) is immunization with live irradiation-attenuated sporozoites [14, 15] . Field studies in Burkina Faso, Mali, Kenya, Gabon, and Tanzania are currently following up on this approach [16] . While these studies are important for the efforts to develop an effective malaria vaccine, attenuation by irradiation is not easily standardized for human use. Over-irradiated sporozoites confer little protection while under-irradiation provides risk for breakthrough infections. More recently, attenuation of sporozoites was conducted by targeted deletion of genes that encode LS essential proteins in the mouse model. In both attenuation models, Plasmodium sporozoites invade hepatocytes within vacuoles, then cease growth completely and do not cause Plasmodium infection of the blood [2, 3] . The protection conferred by attenuated sporozoites was confirmed to be mainly mediated by CD8+ T cells targeting LS antigens and not by antigens presented on the surface of migrating sporozoites [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Recent studies pointed out that when compared to attenuated strains that cease their LS development early, attenuated strains that grow longer in hepatocytes before ceasing growth led to more significant protective immune responses [17] . This indicated that significant exposure to LS antigens can enhance vaccine effectiveness. Further, liver-associated T cells have been implicated in anti-malarial immunity following irradiated sporozoite vaccination [22, 23] . When T cells lack CXCR6, a cell surface marker highly expressed by liver-infiltrating CD8 T cells, there is a reduction of liver-associated memory and sporozoite immunity [22] . Very recent studies (including this report) support that CD8 tissue resident memory T cells appear important for targeting of LS malaria following vaccination [23] [24] [25] . It appears that LS antigens represent important candidates for inducing protective CD8+ T cell responses in the attenuated sporozoite model.",

We focused on the following antigens, which are expressed across Plasmodia: EXP1, PFN, EXP2, ICP, TMP21, and UIS3. EXP1 (exported protein 1) is a glutathione transferase, located at the parasite-host interface, which efficiently degrades cytotoxic hematin, and is associated with the metabolism of and susceptibility to artesunate, a frontline anti-malarial drug [26, 27] . Additionally, it has been shown that EXP1 contains degenerate T cell epitopes [28] . EXP1 has been previously shown to be immunogenic in a mouse model of malaria [29] . There is evidence in humans that EXP1 may be an important anti-malarial target, as a positive antibody response to EXP1 correlated with a statistically significant decrease in malarial infection in children in Burkina Faso [30] . PFN (profilin) has been detected in all life cycle stages, including sporozoites and merozoites, and abundant PFN expression suggests PFN is important for Plasmodium life cycle progression [31, 32] . Like all apicomplexans, Plasmodium utilizes a highly specialized microfilament system for motility and host cell invasion, and profilin plays a key role as an actin-sequestering protein [33, 34] . It has been shown that disturbing expression of PFN results in complete life cycle arrest [35] . Similarly to EXP1, EXP2 (exported protein 2) is an integral vacuolar protein [36] . EXP2 resides primarily on the vacuolar face of the PVM, and likely constitutes the membrane pore [37] . In Plasmodium, ICP (inhibitor of cysteine proteases) has been shown to be necessary for malaria transmission from mosquitos to mammals, sporozoite motility, erythrocyte invasion [38] , and liver-stage development [39] . While little is known about TMP21 (transmembrane protein 21), vaccination with TMP21 reduced liver-stage parasite load in a mouse model and has been shown to contribute to the protective immunity elicited by whole parasite vaccinations [40] . The antigen UIS3 (upregulated in infective sporozoites-3) is a membrane protein that is localized to the PVM in infected hepatocytes [41] and interacts directly with host liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) [42] . UIS3 is essential for early liver-stage development [43] and vaccination with a ChAd63-MAV vaccine containing UIS3 has been shown to be partially protective in a mouse model [44] .",

Given the focus on induction of cellular immunity, we explored using synthetic DNA-encoded plasmid IL-33 (pIL-33) as a unique molecular adjuvant. pIL-33 is a member of the IL-1 family, which although originally associated with Th2 immunity, has also been reported to facilitate the generation of protective Th1 and CD8 T cell immunity [46] . pIL-33 has immunoadjuvant effects in an HPV-associated model for cancer immunotherapy in which cell-mediated immunity is critical for protection and has been reported to enhance potent antigen-specific effector and memory T-cell immunity in a synthetic DNA vaccine setting [48] . The ability to induce potent cell-mediated immunity is important for a vaccine against LS malaria, as is the fact that IL-33 is predominantly expressed at the epithelial barrier as the first line of defense against pathogenic threats, activating a variety of important immune cells [49] , which may be relevant to the necessity for Plasmodium sporozoites to transverse through the dermis before LS infection. Consequently, IL-33 was chosen as a molecular adjuvant for this study. Another strength of the DNA vaccine platform is its ability to drive functional, localized cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in the clinic [47, 50] . Prior work studying the immunity from a hepatitis B DNA vaccine showed the ability of this platform to drive vaccine-specific CTLs to traffic to the liver, an organ that is known to be tolerogenic and suppress T cell responses [51] . The ability of this platform to drive vaccine-specific CTLs in this location highlights the potential to drive relevant, functional CMI in this context.",

Mice were immunized 3 times at 3-week intervals with the EXP1_PFN construct with and without pIL-33. One week after the final immunization lymphocytes were isolated from both liver and spleen of immunized mice and their phenotype and functional capacity was measured using flow cytometry and ELISPOT assays. The percentage of CD8+ cells in the liver expressing CXCR6, a chemokine receptor important for trafficking to the liver [23] , was significantly increased from 40% without co-delivery of pIL-33 to 60% with the addition of pIL-33 ( Figure 4A ) while the expression of CXCR6 on CD8+ cells in the spleen was 10-fold lower ( Figure 4B ) than that on CD8+ cells in the liver. This suggests an improvement of trafficking to the liver with the addition of pIL-33. As seen previously, the addition of pIL-33 increased antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT responses in the spleen ( Figure 4D ) and interestingly, also in the liver ( Figure 4C ). Further investigation of the functionality of the liver-localized T cells using flow cytometry revealed that pIL-33 not only increased the percentage of IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+IL-2+ (triple positive), IFN\u03b3+, and IL-2+ CD4+ cells ( Figure 4G ) and IFN\u03b3+ CD8+ ( Figure 4H ) cells from the spleen, but also increased the percentage of IFN\u03b3+ CD4+ ( Figure 4E ) and IFN\u03b3+CD8+ ( Figure 4F ) cells from the liver. The Py antigen-specific cytokine production profile of CD4+ (E,G) and CD8+ (F,H) T cells from the liver (E,F) and spleen (G,H). Cells were stimulated with pooled peptides for 6 h, stained for intracellular production of IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-2, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The bar graph shows subpopulations of mono-, double-, and triple-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Two days post transfection the cells were probed with post-immune sera from mice immunized with the respective DNA construct (with or without pIL-33) and probed with a fluorescently tagged secondary antibody. Mice immunized with EXP1_PFN showed the most positive staining indicating the highest antibody response. EXP2, ICP, and UIS3 showed intermediate antibody levels and TMP21 showed the lowest levels of antibody induction ( Figure 5 ). The addition of pIL-33 did not appear to alter the amount of detectable antibody binding ( Figure 5 ). However, we cannot conclude whether or not this antibody response is important for the observed immunity, as it is unknown whether these Plasmodium proteins would be available for antibody binding in a physiologically relevant context. It is important to note that while this assay shows the presence of antibodies elicited by vaccination, it does not provide quantitative information on antibody level or titer. ",

The proportion of CD8+ T cells expressing CXCR6 was increased in both the spleen and liver of animals immunized with EXP1_PFN plus pIL-33 compared to antigen alone. This was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the IFN\u03b3 production of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the liver of animals immunized with antigen plus pIL-33 ( Figure 4 ). Together this suggests improved trafficking of vaccine-induced antigen-specific T cells to the liver.",

Animals were then monitored daily for the development of blood-stage disease. In total, 71%-88% of animals immunized with vaccine antigen cocktails alone were protected from blood-stage disease, which increased to 100% protection in the animals immunized with LS antigens plus pIL-33 ( Figure 6 ). This suggests that the increased CXCR6 expression and antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 production in the liver of animals immunized with pIL-33 and a likely corresponding increase in trafficking of vaccine-induced antigen-specific T cells to the liver might contribute to the improvement in protection from challenge. Further study is required to fully understand IL-33 s role in regulating these liver associated T cell responses.",

A synDNA vaccine expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein induced robust humoral and cellular immunity in cynomolgus macaques with minimal signs of contraction over a year. A booster immunization delivered at 1 year post first immunization resulted in a typical recall response with increased antigen-specific antibody titers and IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT responses. CD4+ effector memory (EM) and CD8+ effector memory RA (TEMRA) dominated the antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 expressing T cells after the 1 year boost provided antigen re-exposure [60] . In a recent Phase I clinical trial, a synDNA vaccine expressing the pre-membrane and envelope (prME) proteins of Zika virus induced long-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses in humans. In total, 73% of participants who received the 6 mg dose of vaccine remained seropositive 48 weeks after their last immunization. Cellular immune responses also remained quite robust 48 weeks after the last vaccination [61] . Future studies will investigate the memory phenotype and protective potential of the long-term immune response to synDNA Plasmodium liver-stage antigens.",

Further, this study illustrates the potential efficacy of a synDNA vaccine platform targeting liver-stage proteins in providing protection from malaria infection in this model. We show that a synDNA vaccine targeting EXP1, PFN, EXP2, ICP, UIS3, and TMP21, in combination or alone, elicits a robust T cell response, as well as the production of antibodies against liver-stage malaria. The use of the molecular adjuvant pIL-33 increases the immune response to vaccine and protects 100% of animals from blood-stage disease after sporozoite challenge, where non-adjuvanted vaccine protects 70%-88% of animals from blood-stage disease. Potential contributors to this increased protection in the adjuvanted groups are the increase in antigen responsive liver associated T cells, or perhaps a dose-sparing effect of the adjuvant as previously reported for plasmid IL-12 [62, 63] , resulting in the IL-33 groups showing enhanced cytokine polyfunctionality. Additional dosing and other adjuvant studies remain important.",

Immunization groups were: All vaccine constructs with or without IL-33, EXP1_PFN (exported protein 1_profilin) with or without IL-33, EXP2 (exported protein 2) and ICP (inhibitor of cysteine proteases) with or without IL-33, and TMP21 (transmembrane protein 21) and UIS3 (upregulated in infective sporozoites-3) with or without IL-33. (A) The Py antigen-specific cellular immune response induced by the indicated Py DNA vaccine co-formulation measured by IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT. Cells were stimulated for 18 h with peptide pools encompassing the entire protein. T-tests were used to compare groups with and without IL-33. (B-I) The Py antigen-specific cytokine production profile of CD4+ (D-F) and CD8+ (G-I) T cells induced by the indicated Py DNA vaccine co-formulation. Cells were stimulated with pooled peptides for 6 h, stained for intracellular production of IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-2, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The bar graph shows subpopulations of mono-, double-, and triple-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
