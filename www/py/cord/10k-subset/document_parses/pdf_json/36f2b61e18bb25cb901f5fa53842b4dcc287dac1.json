Luria-Delbr\u00fc ck fluctuation tests and sequencing showed that VSV mutated similarly in baby hamster kidney, murine embryonic fibroblasts, colon cancer, and neuroblastoma cells (approx. 10 25 s/n/r). Cell immortalization through p53 inactivation and oxygen levels (1-21%) did not have a significant impact on viral replication fidelity. This shows that previously published mutation rates can be considered reliable despite being based on a narrow and artificial set of laboratory conditions.

Since viral mutation rates have implications for pathogenesis [3, 4] , vaccine development [5, 6] antiviral therapy [7, 8] , and epidemiological disease management [9, 10] , it is important to have accurate data and a clear understanding of the factors determining these rates. As a case in point, the risk of cross-species transmission is determined, in addition to the ecology of virus-host interactions, by the input of new adaptive mutations in the viral population [11] , and a recent phylogenetic analysis of rabies virus isolates suggested that the waiting time required for host jumps depends on the number of positively selected mutations involved in crossspecies transmission [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 307, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 308, "end": 310, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 375, "end": 378, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 379, "end": 381, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 404, "end": 407, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 408, "end": 410, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 429, "end": 432, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 433, "end": 435, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 477, "end": 480, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 481, "end": 484, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 783, "end": 787, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1003, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In RNA viruses, mutation rates are determined by the intrinsic base selection specificity of the viral polymerase [13] [14] [15] [16] , the presence/absence of proofreading mechanisms such as 39exonuclease activity [17] [18] [19] , or the mode of replication [20, 21] . However, in addition to these virus-encoded factors, viral mutation rates can be host-dependent. For instance, it has been suggested that the replicase of cucumber mosaic virus exhibits different fidelity in pepper and tobacco plants [22, 23] . In retroviruses, replication fidelity may be affected by intra-cellular dNTP imbalance and total concentration, which vary among cell types [24] [25] [26] , although a recent study revealed no differences in the HIV-1 mutation rate in various cell types including T lymphoblast, glioblastoma and human embryonic kidney cells [27] . Also, the expression of host genes may influence the viral mutation rate as is the case of APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases, which can edit the HIV-1 cDNA and produce G-to-A hypermutations [28] [29] [30] . A similar role was postulated for the cellular RNAdependent adenosine deaminase (ADAR) which could lead to Ato-G hypermutation in several RNA viruses, including rhabdoviruses [31] , paramyxoviruses [32] , and retroviruses [33] [34] [35] .

The virion attaches to phosphadtidyl serine or other ubiquitous cell surface receptors and can productively infect most mammalian cells [37] . In nature, VSV infects a very large number of mammal species including livestock (cattle, horse, swine, goats, etc.) and wild animals (rodents, bear, lynx, bats, etc.), and also infects insects (sandflies, blackflies, mosquitoes, etc.) [38, 39] , which act as transmission vectors [40] [41] [42] . Therefore, VSV replicates in widely different cellular environments, but the impact of this heterogeneity on the viral mutation rate is unknown. Actually, nearly all mutation rate estimates for animal viruses have been obtained in standard laboratory cell lines, which are usually immortalized or cancerous and thus show aberrant metabolic/mitotic rates and gene expression patterns. For VSV, most studies are conducted using hamster kidney cells, despite the fact that the brain is the main target organ of rhabdoviruses. Furthermore, all viral mutation rate studies have been conducted under atmospheric oxygen levels but these are substantially higher than those found in most tissues [43] , and the impact of this type of environmental stress in the estimates is unknown. Here, we measured the mutation rate of VSV in primary and tumoral cell types including murine fibroblasts of various origins and neural cells, and under different oxygen levels, as well as insect cells.

Here, we investigated the effects of host factors on viral replication fidelity by measuring the viral mutation rate in different cell types and under various culturing conditions. To carry out these experiments we chose the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an insect-transmitted mammalian RNA virus with an extremely wide cellular and host tropism. We found that the VSV replication machinery was robust to changes in cellular physiology driven by cell immortalization or shifts in temperature and oxygen levels. In contrast, VSV mutated significantly more slowly in insect cells than in mammalian cells, a finding may help us to understand why arthropod-borne viruses tend to evolve more slowly than directly transmitted viruses in nature. using fluctuation tests only because they provided a faster and simpler approach.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Author Summary"}, {"text": "Previous mutation rate studies with VSV have been conducted in BHK-21 cells only [2, 46, 52] . However, these are immortalized/tumoral cells, as opposed to those typically encountered bythe virus in vivo. Furthermore, VSV has a tropism for neural cells, and kidney fibroblasts are not a natural target of the virus. Toaddress the potential effect of immortalization on the viral mutation rate, we performed fluctuation tests in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and isogenic, p53 knock-out, MEFs. The average rate was similar in normal (m = 1.27610 25 ) and p53knock-out MEFs (m = 0.82610 25 ), revealing no significant effectof cellular immortalization (Figure 1 ; t-test: P = 0.232, n = 6). However, many cell lines are tumoral and show other genetic andmetabolic alterations in addition to p53 inactivation. To check the potential effects of these changes, we performed fluctuation tests in CT26 cells from an undifferentiated grade IV colon adenocarcinoma of a BALB/c mouse [53] , but we found no significant differences with primary MEFs (m = 1.18610 25 ; t-test: P = 0.885, n = 6). Of note, BHK-21 are also tumor-forming cells, and the mutation rate was similar to the rate observed in MEFs or CT26 cells (one-way ANOVA: P = 0.293, n = 12). This homogeneity in the VSV mutation rate was not an obvious a priori, because metabolic and mitotic activity should alter the availability of NTPs [54] and hence could impact RNA replication fidelity, although VSV replicates in the cytoplasm and may not be strongly affected by these alterations. This result has implications for the field of oncolytic virotherapy [55] , since it is critical to assess the genetic stability of these therapeutic viruses during large-scale manufacturing and clinical use. In particular, CT26 cells have been used in mice as a model for testing the oncolytic activity of VSV [56] . Also, the above results suggest that VSV replicates with similar fidelity in different cell types, but we sought to test whether this would also hold for neural cells. We therefore performed fluctuation tests in Neuro-2a cells from a mouse neuroblastoma [57] . Again, we found that the average mutation rate did not significantly differ from the rate obtained in BHK-21 cells (m = 1.06610 25 ; t-test: P = 0.461, n = 9). Finally, to test for other potential effects of cell physiology, we also varied oxygen levels. The VSV mutation rate in BHK-21 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) was slightly higher but not significantly different to the rate obtained under standard conditions (m = 2.71610 25 ; t-test: P = 0.122, n = 9). Oxidative stress should lead to the release of ROS, which have been previously shown to be mutagenic for hepatitis C virus [36] . However, VSV does not appear to be sensitive to oxidation levels. This might be related to the fact that the nucleocapsid of mononegavirales forms a tunnel-like structure which wraps the viral genomic RNA and remains assembled during the entire infection cycle [58, 59] , effectively isolating the viral RNA [60] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 84, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 85, "end": 88, "text": "46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 89, "end": 92, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 987, "end": 991, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1408, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1626, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1868, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2129, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2738, "end": 2742, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3006, "end": 3010, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3011, "end": 3014, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3053, "end": 3057, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 663, "end": 672, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Constant mutation rate in mammalian cells"}, {"text": "Since VSV alternates between mammalian and insect hosts in nature, we sought to measure the viral mutation rate in insect cells (Figure 1 ). In S2 cells from D. melanogaster embryos, the average estimate from three independent fluctuation tests was m = 4.08610 26 , representing a fourfold decrease compared with BHK-21 (t-test: P = 0.009, n = 9). To further investigate this, we selected two additional insect cells lines: Sf21 ovarian cells from the moth Spodoptera frugiperda, and C6/36 from Aedes albopictus mosquito larvae. Also, since insect cells were infected at 28uC and mammalian cells at 37uC, we performed four additional tests in BHK-21 at 28uC. We used estimates obtained in mammalian (BHK-21, BHK-21 at 28uC, MEF, MEF p532/2, CT26, and Neuro-2a) and insect cells (S2, Sf-21, and C6/36) to jointly test for the effects of host type and temperature (fixed factors) in a two-way ANOVA in which the specific cell line was treated as a random factor nested within host type. This confirmed that VSV shows lower mutation rate in insect cells than in mammalian cells (ANOVA: P,0.001), and also that temperature cannot account for this result because the estimates in BHK-21 were actually higher at 28uC than at 37uC (P = 0.001). Using log 10 -transformed data, the estimated effect size of the host type in the above model was 0.59060.205, which implies a 3.9 fold mutation rate decrease in insect cells. One possible explanation for this difference is that our sensitivity to detect MAR mutants varied between assays performed in mammalian and insect cells. To address this, we first verified that MAR plating efficiency was similar in BHK-21, S2, Sf21, and C6/36 cells using a genetically engineered MAR mutant (D259A). Second, we tested for differences in the mutation target size (T). To do this, we sampled 15 individual MAR plaques from fluctuation tests performed in S2 cells and sequenced the region of the G protein controlling this phenotype. We found the same amino acid replacements as in fluctuation tests performed in BHK-21 cells (D257N, D259N, S273T, see above) except for D259A. However, because the D259 mutant is viable in insect cells [61] , failure to detect it was probably due to insufficient sampling depth. We also found substitution A263E, which was reported previously in BHK-21 cells [51] . Therefore, insect S2 and BHK-21 cells shared a similar mutational repertoire and plating efficiency, supporting the consistency of the observed mutation rate difference. Interestingly, VSV [62] and arboviruses in general [63, 64] tend to evolve more slowly than directly transmitted viruses. Our own meta-analysis using 170 previously published evolutionary rates confirmed that, after accounting for phylogenetic relatedness and the timespan of sequence sampling, arboviruses showed a significantly lower evolution rate than directly transmitted viruses (Figure 2 ; two-way ANOVA: P = 0.006), the geometric mean rates being 5.7610 24 substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) and 1.3610 23 s/s/y, respectively. This has been often interpreted in terms of fitness tradeoffs, whereby neutral or beneficial mutations in mammals can be deleterious in insects, and vice versa, thus restricting viral evolution. However, whether arboviruses show similar mutation rates in mammalian and insect cells has not been addressed before, and our results offer a new possible explanation for the relatively slow arboviral evolution. Future experiments with other arboviruses could help elucidate the generality of these findings and, if so, to delineate the mechanisms behind the observed differences in replication fidelity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2163, "end": 2167, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2320, "end": 2324, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2516, "end": 2520, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2548, "end": 2552, "text": "[63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2553, "end": 2556, "text": "64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 137, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2882, "end": 2891, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Lower mutation rate in insect cells"}, {"text": "Viruses were obtained from an infectious cDNA clone by transfecting baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells [65, 66] , purified by filtration (0.22 mm) , and stored at 70uC in aliquots until use.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 107, "text": "[65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 108, "end": 111, "text": "66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 146, "text": "(0.22 mm)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Virus"}, {"text": "BHK-21 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.02 mM L-Glutamine, a mix of non-essential amino-acids, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 60 mg/mL penicillin, and 2 mg/mL fungizone.

For instance, BHK-21 cells are at least partially responsive to interferon [67] , potentially inhibiting growth of MAR mutants and biasing mutant counts down. To calibrate this effect, we titrated a MAR clone obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (substitution D259A in the surface glycoprotein G) in the presence of undiluted supernatants harvested from cells previously infected with the wild-type virus (N i <300 pfu and N f ><10 4 pfu, similar to fluctuation tests), adding monoclonal antibody to the plates to observe MAR plaques only. The wild-type infections were performed under each of the experimental conditions (BHK-21, MEF, MEF p532/2, CT26, Neuro-2a, BHK-21 with 1% O 2 , BHK-21 at 28uC, S2, Sf21 and C6/36 cells). Addition of supernatants from BHK-21 cells infected under standard conditions did not alter the titer of the D259 MAR clone, hence the relative plating efficiency was z = 1.
