Annually recurring of type A influenza epidemics is mainly due to continual antigenic drift of surface glycoproteins of the virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Palese and Young 1982; Webster et al. 1982) . Gradual changes of influenza antigens in the drift process result in decay of host immunity and ultimately enable the new influenza virus to reinfect previously infected hosts. To incorporate antigenic drift of influenza A phenomenologically, Pease originally suggests the framework of susceptible-infected-recovered-(re)susceptible (SIRS) dynamics with viral evolution causing transition from the recovered class to the susceptible class (Pease 1987) . In recent literatures, many of these SIRS or SIRS-type models have provided valuable insights into evolutionary dynamics of influenza A in humans by antigenic drift (Casagrandi et al. 2006; Dushoff et al. 2004; Hooten et al. 2010; Shaman et al. 2010; Yuan and Koelle 2012 ). An alternative path to incorporating antigenic drift into epidemiological influenza models is that of formulating multi-strain models (e.g., Andreasen and Sasaki 2006; Gog and Grenfell 2002; Koelle et al. 2006; Nu\u00f1o et al. 2005) .

It is traditionally supposed that the incidence rate of disease (including influenza A) transmission is bilinear with respect to the number of susceptible individuals S(t) and the number of infective individuals I (t), e.g., \u03b2SI, where \u03b2 is the transmission rate (e.g., Anderson and May 1991; Casagrandi et al. 2006; Hethcote 1976 Hethcote , 2000 . As a matter of fact, it is generally difficult to get the details of transmission of infectious diseases, which may vary under different conditions. In addition, choosing generalized incidence rate function may allow the data themselves to flexibly decide the function form of incidence rates in practice (Xia et al. 2005) . For these reasons, there is a wide and increasing interest in studying epidemic models with nonlinear incidence rates (see, e.g., Feng and Thieme 2000; Liu et al. 1986; Ruan and Wang 2003 and the references cited therein). For instance, Capasso and Serio (1978) used a saturated incidence rate \u03b2SI/(1 + \u03b1 I ) to describe that incidence rates increase more gradually than linear in the infected I and susceptible S, and then to prevent the unboundedness of contact rate; Hethcote and van den Driessche (1991) used a nonlinear incidence rate given by \u03b2SG (I ) . To incorporate the impact of media coverage to the spread of infectious diseases, Cui et al. (2008a) considered the incidence rate \u03b2e \u2212m I SI with m > 0.

By (ii) in Corollary 2, we see that the disease is persistent in the first two cases, while the disease is extinctive in the last case. The computer simulations shown in Figs. 1 and 2 clearly support these results. Figure 1 shows trends of the evolution of the mean and standard deviation of I (t). It is observed that when \u03c3 < \u03c3 * (i.e., R S 0 > 1), both the mean and the standard deviation ultimately tend to a constant; however, both the mean and the standard deviation quickly decline and tend to 0 for \u03c3 > \u03c3 * (noting that \u03c3 > \u03c3 * is equivalent to R S 0 < 1). We can also see that when the environmental noises exist, the mean of I (t) is always less than the corresponding deterministic solution for all case of \u03c3 , and the mean is reduced gradually with the increase in white noise intensity \u03c3 . This shows that white noise perturbations of the transmission rate \u03b2 can be beneficial to control the spread of influenza virus on average. However, as shown in (b) of Fig. 1 , when the intensity of environmental noises is small (i.e., \u03c3 < \u03c3 * ), the standard deviation of I (t) increases with the increase in noise intensity \u03c3 .

For environmental noises intensity \u03c3 = 1.665\u00d710 \u22124 satisfying \u03c3 * < \u03c3 < \u03c3 * , Figs. 5 and 6 give the evolution dynamic of I (t) in a relatively short term (300 weeks). From Fig. 6 , it is observed that for different initial values (S(0), I (0), R(0)) = (9980, 20, 0) and (9800, 200, 0), the mean and standard deviation of I (t) tend to be uniform quickly. This, together with (c) of Fig. 5 , implies when \u03c3 * < \u03c3 < \u03c3 * , the probability distribution of the values of the path of I (t) for system (36) do not depend on the initial value of I (t). As shown in (a) and (b) of Fig. 5 , both the disease persistence and extinction are observed when \u03c3 * < \u03c3 < \u03c3 * . At t = 300 weeks, it is seen from (c) of Fig. 5 that the probability of the recurrence of influenza epidemic may be positive during several years. Based on 10,000 stochastic simulations, we can estimate that P{I (300) \u2264 10 \u22124 } \u2248 0.4321, P{I (300) \u2265 20} \u2248 0.159 at t = 300 weeks (about 5.77 years). This implies that in the short term, both the persistence and extinction of influenza virus may occur in the case of \u03c3 * < \u03c3 < \u03c3 * . Figure 7 describes the long-run evolutionary behavior of I (t) for \u03c3 * < \u03c3 < \u03c3 * , including the mean and standard deviation.

It is observed that the mean level decreases with the increase in the noise intensity, and that both the mean level and the standard deviation level decrease very slowly along with time; however, it is found surprisingly that the standard deviation level decreases with the increase in the noise intensity, which is very similar to the case of \u03c3 > \u03c3 * .

Hence, by comparing Fig. 7 with 8, we find there is a strong possibility that \u03c3 * is the threshold of environmental noises, i.e., R S 0 is the threshold of disease persistence or extinction. This also suggests that Conjecture 8.1 of Gray et al. (2011) may hold for our stochastic SIRS system with nonlinear incidence rate and variable population size.

Hence, from the point of epidemiology view, it is very significant to investigate the probability of reappearance of influenza epidemics during several decades for \u03c3 * < \u03c3 < \u03c3 * , though the influenza virus will likely be eradicated ultimately when \u03c3 > \u03c3 * . Figure 9 gives the long-run evolutionary behavior of the probability of disease outbreak for \u03c3 * < \u03c3 < \u03c3 * . Here, the disease outbreak means the number of infected individuals I (t) is more than the stationary level I * of the corresponding deterministic model. As shown in Fig. 9 , the probability of disease outbreak decreases very slowly along with time, although it decreases with the increase in the noise intensity. For instance, based on 10,000 stochastic simulations, Fig. 9 The evolution of probability of disease outbreak is graphed for the parameters \u03c3 1 = 1.665 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (red line) and \u03c3 2 = 1.675 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (green line), where \u03c3 * < \u03c3 1 < \u03c3 2 < \u03c3 * and the disease outbreak means I (t) \u2265 I * = 58.94 (Color figure online) at t = 300 weeks (about 5.77 years), t = 600 weeks (about 11.54 years) and t = 1500 weeks (about 28.85 years), respectively. So far, by combining analytical results with numerical techniques, we have comprehensively analyzed the influence of the white noise on the spread dynamics of influenza for all kinds of values of the noise intensity \u03c3 . In the end, we give an example of Case 1 with the relatively realistic noise intensity. In fact, the white noise intensity may be less than the critical intensity \u03c3 * in the real word. In Gu et al. (2011) , authors formulated stochastic SIR epidemic model with the transmission rate \u03b2 disturbed by white Gaussian noise in the similar form to (2) (see, P. 3685 in Gu et al. 2011) ; the real data of SARS in Beijing in 2003 are nicely fitted by their model with the white noise intensity \u03c3 = 2.31 \u00d7 10 \u22125 < \u03c3 * , which has been converted into the time unit (week \u22121 ) in this paper. This realistic noise intensity does not exceed the critical intensity \u03c3 * for both cases above in (38) and (39). It is found that the distance between this noise intensity and the critical intensity \u03c3 * becomes larger with the increase in the basic reproduction number R 0 of the corresponding deterministic model. For this realistic noise intensity, we compute that R 0 \u2212 R S 0 = 0.026673 from (7), and the mean and the standard deviation of infected individuals are E(I (t)) = 26.977 < I * = 27.24 and Var(I (t)) = 8.47 at t = 300 weeks, respectively. Compared with the corresponding deterministic model, both the threshold parameter of disease extinction R S 0 and the average level of infecteds decrease slightly. However, it is seen from Fig. 10 that the white noise increases the volatility of infecteds (i.e., the standard deviation). In particular, P{I (300) \u2265 I * } \u2248 0.4512.
