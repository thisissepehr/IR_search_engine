Very few case reports in the literature have described a relationship between Graves disease and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We present a case of a patient with Graves disease who was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Case presentation: Our patient was a 30-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension and a family history of Graves disease who had recently been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and placed on methimazole. She presented to our hospital with the complaints of progressive shortness of breath and dizziness. Her vital signs were stable. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, depending on clinical and laboratory results, and also was found to have highly elevated free T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone. She received multiple sessions of plasmapheresis and ultimately had a total thyroidectomy. The patient's hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Her platelets stabilized at approximately 50,000/\u03bcl, and her ADAMTS13 activity normalized despite multiple complications. The patient ultimately had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity and died despite multiple attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Conclusion: Graves disease is an uncommon trigger for the development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and very few cases have been reported thus far. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this association in the appropriate clinical context to comprehensively monitor hyperthyroid patients during treatment.",

            "text": "Autoimmune diseases tend to cluster not only in families but also in the same individual. Graves disease is an example of an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies bind with hormone receptors of the thyroid gland, causing the thyroid to overproduce thyroid hormone [1] . It is characterized clinically by diffuse goiter, ophthalmopathy, hyperthermia, agitation, weight loss, palpitations, and even heart failure [1] . Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an autoimmune disease caused by a deficiency of ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand Factor (vWF)-cleaving metalloprotease [2] . This leads to the buildup of vWF multimers, activating a cascade in the bloodstream leading to destruction of platelets by the large multimers. TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and evidence of end-organ damage. The treatment primarily is plasmapheresis to remove the autoantibodies from the bloodstream [2] . TTP carries a high mortality. Graves disease has been associated with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but only a few case reports have described a possible association of Graves disease with TTP. We present a case in which a patient with Graves disease was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent TTP.",

In preparation for thyroidectomy, she was treated with propylthiouracil, potassium iodide oral solution, cholestyramine, prednisone, and propranolol.

            "text": "TTP is a rare disease with an incidence of approximately 3 cases per 1 million adults per year [3] . TTP usually involves microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal injury [3] . ADAMTS13 is a metalloproteinase that breaks down vWF; when it is deficient, large multimers of vWF circulate, provoke the formation of thrombi, and cause widespread platelet activation leading to platelets' subsequent deficiency and destruction [3] . It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as ITP, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, and systemic sclerosis; however, it is not commonly associated with Graves disease. It has inherited and acquired forms [4] . The mortality associated with TTP can be as high as 90%, and clinical diagnosis is the key to rapid management [4] . Treatment of TTP depends on the risk stratification of patients based on clinical and laboratory data present at the time of diagnosis. Several therapies are available, including plasma exchange (PEX), high-dose steroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab. Daily PEX is the mainstay of treatment. It allows removal of autoantibodies and repletes ADAMTS13. If there is any delay in PEX, then fresh frozen plasma transfusion should be considered. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated unless bleeding is life-threatening [5] . Caplacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to vWF and blocks vWF interaction with platelet glycoprotein lb-IX-V. As indicated by faster platelet count normalization, it prevents further consumption of platelets into microthrombi and the consequent progression of tissue ischemia [6] .",

Graves disease patients receiving thionamide therapy should be monitored for agranulocytosis by checking the complete blood count. If there are any abnormalities in the cell count, especially thrombocytopenia, clinicians should consider the possibility of another autoimmune process, such as TTP, in the appropriate clinical context. Emphasis should be placed on controlling hyperthyroidism and avoiding lapses in medical therapy to prevent complications, as in our patient's case.",
