Severe disease following H5N1 influenza infection is often associated with dysregulated host innate immune response also known as cytokine storm but the virological and cellular basis of these responses has not been clearly described. We rescued a series of 6:2 reassortant viruses that combined a PR8 HA/NA pairing with the internal gene segments from human adapted H1N1, H3N2, or avian H5N1 viruses and found that mice infected with the virus with H5N1 internal genes suffered severe weight loss associated with increased lung cytokines but not high viral load. This phenotype did not map to the NS gene segment, and NS1 protein of H5N1 virus functioned as a type I IFN antagonist as efficient as NS1 of H1N1 or H3N2 viruses. Instead we discovered that the internal genes of H5N1 virus supported a much higher level of replication of viral RNAs in myeloid cells in vitro, but not in epithelial cells and that this was associated with high induction of type I IFN in myeloid cells. We also found that in vivo during H5N1 recombinant virus infection cells of haematopoetic origin were infected and produced type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. Taken together our data infer that human and avian influenza viruses are differently controlled by host factors in alternative cell types; internal gene segments of avian H5N1 virus uniquely drove high viral replication in myeloid cells, which triggered an excessive cytokine production, resulting in severe immunopathology.",

            "text": "The outcome of infection with an influenza virus can vary widely from asymptomatic infection to death. Although infection outcomes can be influenced by host factors such as age, prior immunity, genetic susceptibility and comorbidities [1] [2] [3] [4] , differences in the virus itself undoubtedly contribute to the variation observed. The most devastating human influenza virus in recent recorded history was the 'Spanish influenza' virus that caused the 1918 pandemic. Recombinant influenza viruses reconstructed from the sequences of 1918 influenza are rapidly lethal in animal models [5] . H5N1 'bird flu' is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that has occasionally infected humans with catastrophic outcome. Of around 856 people infected by this virus, 52.8% have died. This contrasts starkly with the outcome of infection in 2009 with the new pH1N1 pandemic virus that was associated with just 0.02% case fatality [4, 6] . One feature often associated with the severe disease following H5N1 infection, and also noted during animal experimental infections with 1918 virus, is a dysregulated host innate immune response known as the cytokine storm. This response is characterized by excessive levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as type I interferons (IFNs; IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2), TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL10 [7-11], leading to prolonged fever, lymphopenia, severe pneumonia, and extensive lung damage [12] . Although cytokine storms are not unique to influenza, they are almost always associated with high mortality rates [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, it is critical to understand the immunological and virological mechanism behind the activation of these storms, particularly in light of recent evidence that indicates it is possible for H5N1 strains to become airborne transmissible [16] [17] .",

However, excessive type I IFN responses amplify the early pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the lung via type I IFN receptor signaling [18] [19] , and have been associated with lung inflammation in severe influenza infection [20] . Previous studies revealed that lung epithelial cells, macrophages, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) all express type I IFNs to some extent during influenza infection [21] [22] . However, the primary source of type I IFNs in response to influenza infection, especially H5N1, and the virological mechanism behind the cytokine storm remain unknown.",

NS1 suppresses the host's antiviral response by direct inhibition of activation of RIG-I by viral RNAs [23] [24] , as well as through dsRNA sequestration, and modification of the expression of induced genes [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . NS1 gene sequences vary between different strains and subtypes of influenza virus and between viruses isolated from different hosts [30] . It is possible the cytokine storm triggered by H5N1 influenza virus in humans is the result of an unadapted avian NS1 protein that does not efficiently antagonize the type I IFN induction pathways in human cells. However, previous reports have shown that NS1 proteins from a variety of different avian influenza virus strains including H5N1 viruses were able to control type I IFN responses in cells of human origin in vitro [31] [32] [33] [34] .",

First, the H5 HA protein harbours a multibasic cleavage site that facilitates multiple cycles of virus replication outside of the respiratory tract. Possession of a multibasic cleavage site in HA determines the highly pathogenic phenotype in poultry hosts [35] and also contributes to the high pathogenicity in the mouse model [36] [37] . However, other influenza viruses associated with severe disease including cytokine storm in animal models, such as 1918 H1N1 influenza, do not carry this motif [38] . Other features of the H5 HA that might contribute to H5N1 pathogenicity in mice and humans include a preference to bind \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid (SA) receptors thus targeting the virus to the lung [39] , a pH of fusion that is higher than for human-adapted strains that might enhance entry into endothelial cells [40] , and the ability to trigger acute lung injury through a TLR4 dependent pathway [41] . However, receptor binding specificity and pH stability of H5 HA might be altered if H5 viruses were to gain human transmissibility, so it is important to understand the contribution of internal gene segments to disease severity.",

The H5N1 Tky/05 virus is highly pathogenic in mice [46] . In addition, we generated similar recombinant viruses with internal gene segments from a seasonal H3N2 influenza virus A/Victoria/3/1975 (Vic/75) or from a prototypic early pH1N1 pandemic virus A/England/195/2009 (Eng/09), also combined with HA and NA genes from PR8. Finally to assess the importance of the NS gene segment, we generated a chimeric virus with five internal gene segments from the pH1N1 virus (PB1, PB2, PA, NP and M), and the NS segment from the avian H5N1 virus, combined with the PR8 HA and NA genes (Eng/09:TkyNS) ( Fig 1A) . Thus, all four of these viruses had the same tropism determined by the PR8 HA and NA gene segments. The three 6:2 viruses replicated efficiently in MDCK cells. The virus with Tky/05 internal genes replicated slightly faster than the other two, showing higher titres at 12 and 24 hours. The chimeric virus with Tky/NS gene produced titres around one log less than the other viruses at 12 and 24 hours post infection, although it attained a high titre by 36 hours (Fig 1B) .",

Mice in this group rapidly lost weight in the first four days after infection, reaching almost 20% weight loss by day 4. Interestingly, this dramatic weight loss did not correlate with a higher lung viral load ( Fig 2B) or with increased spread of virus through the lungs (S1 Fig). Indeed, the viral titre in lung homogenates was highest for mice infected with the 6:2 Eng/09 virus on both day 2 and day 7 post infection. Day 2 lung titres were similar between the other three viruses.

To assess the induction of type I IFNs by the RG viruses in the present study we utilized a reporter A549 cell line we previously generated that harbors a reporter gene with the IFN-\u03b2 promoter upstream of luciferase. The reporter cells were infected with equal titres of the four RG viruses and luciferase was measured at 24 hours post infection (Fig 3A) . In contrast to what was observed in vivo, infection with the 6:2 Tky/05 virus did not lead to high activation of the IFN\u03b2 promoter. Indeed, it was the 6:2 virus with internal genes from Eng/09 (pH1N1) virus that stimulated the highest luciferase signal in the A549 cells, as we previously described [50] . The 5:1:2 chimeric virus that combined polymerase gene segments from Eng/09 with the NS gene segment from Tky/05 did not induce a high luciferase signal from infected A549 reporter cells, implying that the Tky/05 NS1 protein functioned as an effective type I IFN antagonist ( Fig  3A) .",

In GM-DCs, by 8 hours post infection levels of mRNA and vRNA of the Tky/05 virus were 7.7 and 17.0 fold higher than that of the human adapted viruses, respectively (Fig 5B and 5C ). In contrast, in MTEC levels of viral RNAs were not higher for the Tky/05 virus (Fig 5D and 5E) . In other epithelial cells tested, human A549 cells or mouse LA4 (lung epithelial) cells, there was also little or no difference between levels of viral RNAs produced (S6 We also generated a mutant virus that would be compromised in replication in mammalian cells by engineering the mutation K627E in the Tky/05 PB2 gene segment. Indeed accumulation of v and mRNAs in GM-DCs infected with this virus were greatly decreased compared to the 'wild type' 6:2 Tky/05 virus with the mammalian-adapting 627K motif (Fig 6A and 6B ). The mutant virus with PB2 627E no longer induced IFN-\u03b1 mRNA in infected GM-DCs ( Fig  6C) . In order to ensure the PR8 HA and NA of the Ty/05 virus was not misrepresenting the ability of an H5N1 virus to infect and replicate in GM-DCs, we generated PR8:TkyHA sb NA, that contained the six internal genes from PR8 and the H5 HA and N1 NA from A/turkey/ Turkey/05/2005 virus. To make it biologically safe, the multi-basic cleavage site of H5 HA was removed. We compared the infection of GM-DCs by this virus with infection by whole PR8 virus and found them to be similar (S7 Fig). The m, c, and vRNA accumulation were also similar between PR8 and PR8:TkyHA sb NA infected GM-DCs, and significantly lower than in GM-DCs infected with 6:2 Tky/05 virus (Fig 6D-6F) .

The HPAI H5N1 virus has been a public health concern for more than a decade because of frequent zoonoses and the high case fatality rate associated with human infections [57] [58] [59] . At least part of the high virulence of this virus can be explained by features of the H5 HA protein such as a propensity to bind to \u03b1-2,3-SA receptors in the lungs, an ability to enter endothelial cells, and a multi-basic cleavage site that might enable systemic spread and infection of cell types not usually infected by seasonal influenza viruses [35, 42, [60] [61] [62] [63] . Indeed recent work by Tundup et al. used a similar approach to that employed here to control virus tropism in vivo by engineering MiR target sites into RG H5N1 virus, and highlighted the importance of endothelial cell infection in H5N1 pathogenesis in mice [37] . However, some features of the H5 HA that support the extended tropism of H5N1 avian influenza would likely be lost if the virus gained airborne transmissibility, and so it is important to understand how other genes of the virus also affect pathogenesis if we are to predict the likely severity of an H5N1 pandemic.",

In contrast to the ferret model, the mouse model of influenza benefits from a plethora of established protocols and immunological reagents, as well as a fully annotated genome. In particular, the lack of annotation of the ferret genome makes it uncertain as to whether the NPr142-Tky/05 virus would be restricted in hematopoetic cells. A recent article, as well as our own nucleotide H5N1 influenza virus internal genes determine high replication in myeloid cells and severe outcome BLAST analysis, have revealed a high degree of similarity between mouse miRNA-142 and an unannotated miRNA in the ferret genome, but further research is necessary to understand whether this putative miRNA-142 displays similar cell-type specific effects in ferrets as it does in mice [37] .",

This revealed that the internal genes of the H5N1 virus contribute to the severe outcome in vivo. Upon infection of mice with the virus with H5N1 internal genes, dramatic body weight loss was accompanied by high levels of type I IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, although titres of virus were not higher than in mice infected with human adapted viruses.

However, the cell type that is the primary source of type I IFN, especially during H5N1 infection in vivo was not clear. Previous work has shown that CD11c+ cells, which constitute macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells, produce the bulk of IFN-\u03b2 in vivo following infection with a mouse adapted influenza virus [51] . Our data suggest that H5N1 triggers an unusual and excessive cytokine response compared to human adapted viruses in cells of haematopoetic origin (Figs 4-6) . In vitro, using GM-DCs, which are thought to represent a mixture of monocyte derived and conventional DCs [68] , we found that the 6:2 H5N1 virus induced significantly more type I IFNs than the equivalent human adapted viruses. In contrast, in epithelial cells, the 6:2 H5N1 virus was not a potent type I IFN inducer. Conflicting reports in the literature about the propensity of H5N1 influenza viruses to trigger high type I IFNs might be explained by our cell type specific findings: Cheung et al. first reported high cytokines induced by H5N1 viruses using human monocyte derived macrophage populations, whereas Zeng et al. found that H5N1 viruses effectively controlled type I IFNs in human bronchial epithelial cells [10, 69] . Although GM-derived dendritic cells are not perfect analogues for dendritic cells found in the lung, it is striking that the pattern of type I IFNs production in these cells closely resembled that produced in vivo during infection by the three strains of RG 6:2 influenza viruses. Moreover the decrease in lung type I IFN levels during infection with the Mir142 targeted RG virus confirms that a proportion of the cytokines that contribute to the proinflammatory response during H5N1 virus infection were secreted in vivo by infected haematopoetic cells.",

Three pieces of evidence from our study ruled out that the H5N1 NS1 protein was deficient in this regard: first, there were low levels of cytokines in lungs of mice infected with the 5:1:2 Eng/09:TkyNS virus, second, the 6:2 Tky/05 virus effectively controlled type I IFN induction in epithelial cells and third, exogenously expressed Tky/ 05 NS1 protein could efficiently suppress an IFN stimulus, at least in epithelial cells. Since several other viral gene products are implicated in controlling the innate immune response, including two of the polymerase proteins, PB2 and PA, as well as the accessory proteins PB1-F2, and PA-X, it may be that one or more of these functions are defunct in the Tky/05 virus, although sequence analysis based on current knowledge does not support this [70] . Perhaps some IFN antagonists of the avian influenza virus do not function in mammalian myeloid cells. We were not able to test directly whether exogenously expressed Tky/05 NS1 protein or any other virally encoded IFN antagonists were able to control type I IFN induction in the GM-DC cells we employed here. However, using a panel of RG viruses in which individual polymerase gene segments were swapped between Tky/05 and Eng09, we did not find any single viral gene to which we could attribute the high cytokine inducing phenotype (S10 Fig). The alternative and more plausible explanation for our data is that the higher levels of a viral RNA species produced during H5N1 infection in myeloid cells, which are more sensitive to viral pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) than epithelial cells, outweighed the potency of the H5N1 virus-encoded IFN antagonists.",

We found that viruses with H5N1 internal genes had an unusual propensity to drive high levels of RNA replication in the GM-derived DC cells infected in vitro. The conventional pathway by which influenza virus triggers a type I IFN response is by RIG-I detection of replicated viral RNAs and subsequent signaling through MAVS [71] [72] [73] . Infection of GM-DCs derived from Mavs -/mice did not result in any type I IFN production despite similar levels of virus replication (S8 Fig) suggesting the pathways triggered by H5N1 virus are the conventional ones. Type I IFN induction in MAVS positive cells was dependent on replication and correlated with the amount of viral RNAs generated. We hypothesize that one or more host cell factors that are differentially expressed in myeloid cells vs. epithelial cells affect the behavior of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the avian and the human adapted virus differently. Thus the severe disease resulting from infection with H5N1 virus stems from excessive RNA polymerase activity in mammalian myeloid cells. High viral replication has been previously linked with the clinical outcome of H5N1 infection in mice [36] . The inappropriate early type I IFN response is not dampened by viral IFN antagonists and drives a downstream production of inflammatory cytokines in the lung that leads to severe weight loss. Whether the lack of control of virus replication in myeloid cells is a common feature of other avian influenza viruses associated with severe human infections, whether there is a specific virus signature responsible and the identity of host factors that determine these differences, remain to be established.",
