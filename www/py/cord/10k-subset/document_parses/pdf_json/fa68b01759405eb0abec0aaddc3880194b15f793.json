Fragile X-related protein 1 (FXR1P), which plays an important role in normal muscle development, is one of the two autosomal paralogs of FMRP. To understand the functions of FXR1P, we screened FXR1P-interacting proteins by using a yeast two-hybrid system. The fragile X-related gene 1 (FXR1) was fused to pGBKT7 and then used as the bait to screen the human fetal brain cDNA library. The screening results revealed 10 FXR1P-interacting proteins including Bcl-2-associated transcription factor 1 (BTF). The interaction between FXR1P and BTF was confirmed by using both b-galactosidase assay and growth test in selective media. Co-immunoprecipitation assay in mammalian cells was also carried out to confirm the FXR1P/BTF interaction. Moreover, we confirmed that BTF co-localized with FXR1P in the cytoplasm around the nucleus in rat vascular smooth muscle cells by using confocal fluorescence microscopy.

It was reported that FXS affects 1 in 2000 men and 1 in 4000 women [2] and 2.8% of the Chinese mental retardation (MR) population screened by DNA analysis had the fragile X full mutation [3] . FXS is caused by the mutations of the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1), which is located on the X chromosome and whose locus at Xq27.3 coincides with the folate-sensitive fragile site [4, 5] . The syndrome is characterized by MR, macroorchidism, typical facial appearance, and various degrees of autistic behavior [6] . Fragile X-related gene 1 (FXR1) belongs to the FXR gene family including FMR1 and FXR2, and the sequence of FXR1 is highly conservative [7] . The coding products of FXR1 and FXR2 are fragile X-related protein 1 (FXR1P) and FXR2P, respectively. They share 60% identical amino acids with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is encoded by FMR1 [8, 9] . These three proteins share the same characteristic functional domains of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), i.e. two KH domains and one RGG box, which bind to a variety of RNAs [10] and associate with the 60S ribosomal subunits [11] .

It was first found in human acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1, and it locates on human chromosome 6q22-23 [44] . Although linked to the Bcl-2 family members, BTF does not share structural similarities with these proteins [45] . The most prominent feature of BTF is the presence of an arginine-serine (RS)-rich region located near the N-terminus. RS domain-containing proteins are typically linked with pre-mRNA biogenesis and processing, such as pre-mRNA splicing [46] [47] [48] . In 2007, Merz et al. [49] examined the composition of human mRNPs by using LC-MS/MS and discovered the presence of BTF among newly identified mRNP proteins. A subsequent study identified BCLAF1 in hmRNP that mediated cyclin D1 message stability with SNIP1, SkIP, TAP150, and Pinin [50] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 55, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 106, "end": 110, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 338, "end": 342, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 581, "end": 585, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 591, "end": 595, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 619, "end": 623, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 879, "end": 883, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The most important role of BTF is to function as a regulator in apoptosis, and the protein is widely expressed in some tissues, such as the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and so on, acting as an induction factor for apoptosis. Our results suggested that in vivo FXR1P and BTF play a biological role in the forming of a complex or the correlation between them. FXR1 is a housekeeping gene. FXR1P, the protein encoded by FXR1, plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Moreover, high expression of FXR1P occurs not only in the brain and the gonad, but also in muscle and heart.

Although we have not yet known the specific mechanism and interaction between FXR1P and BTF, we can be sure that BTF is a new member of the regulatory networks of FXR1P, and plays a certain role in the entire regulatory system.
