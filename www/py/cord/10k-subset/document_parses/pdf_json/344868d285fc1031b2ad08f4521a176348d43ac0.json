Influenza viruses are important members of the family Orthomyxoviridae and are characterized as Types A, B, and C on the basis of the character of the internal nucleoprotein antigen. Influenza A viruses infect domestic birds, wild birds, humans, pigs, and ocean mammals. Until recently, the other types had not been found to infect birds. When referring to avian influenza, we mean a syndrome of avian diseases caused by influenza A viruses. Moreover, influenza viruses are further divided into subtypes determined by hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) *Corresponding author (email: cao413@irsa.ac.cn) antigens. To date, 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes have been identified from influenza A. New viruses can be formed by any combination of subtypes. Thus, theoretically, there are 144 influenza A viruses, although there are fewer in reality. When humans are co-infected with different types of viruses, these viruses have the propensity to re-assort or mutate and produce new viruses that spread among humans rapidly. This leads to serious socio-economic and public health consequences. According to the pathogenicity of viruses to avian species, avian influenza is usually divided into highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and mildly pathogenic avian influenza (MPAI Several preliminary studies showed that the occurrences of HPAI have high temporal and spatial clustering and are closely related to environmental factors [5] . Most of the avian influenza cases reported involved contact with large bodies of water and waterfowl. Chen et al. [6] justified that the H5N1 virus had already been transmitted between migratory birds at a lake. Waterfowl not only comprised wild birds but also migratory birds and domestic birds (such as ducks). Because of their stopover functions, it is strongly suspected that water bodies are significant locations for the transmission of avian influenza, especially between migratory birds to poultry. In addition, seasonal changes affected outbreaks, which can probably be attributed to temperature changes. Therefore, even though the clear relationship between environmental factors and avian influenza outbreaks was not explained and substantiated, we suspect that environmental factors affect the spread of influenza. In early research, remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GISs) were successfully used in analyzing malaria and schistosomiasis, demonstrating the tremendous potential of adapting GIS and RS techniques in explaining epidemics in specific environments [7, 8] . RS can obtain abundant data and a GIS can provide spatial analysis tools to interpret the relationships among flyways, the environment, and HPAI. Early qualitative analyses using GIS and RS techniques showed that various factors (such as climate, bird migration, transportation, and water bodies) have significant correlation with the occurrence of HPAI [9, 10] . Determining the exact environmental factors influencing outbreaks is now the key to understanding the spread of HPAI. Recent research indicates that rice agriculture positively corresponds to HPAI occurrence [11] , which implies that vegetation and the spill-over function of poultry should not be neglected. Besides vegetation, the land surface temperature (LST) and circumstance of poultry have roused the interest of researchers to identify how HPAI spreads. Previous research has mainly employed spatial analysis functions and exploratory spatial data analysis techniques such as overlapping analysis, buffering analysis, histograms, scatterplots, and spatial clustering (in these studies, climate data such as water vapor, land surface temperature, and aerosol optical depth were obtained by R S) We selected essential environmental factors only and reduced the number of correlations between factors. Conventionally, the auto-logistic regression model has been applied in epidemiology, especially in binary outbreak modeling [12, 13] . In addition, including modern spatial and temporal statistics has enhanced the accuracy of simulation. The Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) approach applies outcomes of the binary logistic model efficiently by tolerating uncertainties throughout assessment [14] [15] [16] . Employing the BME and binary logistic model reveals systematic associations between the environmental influence and spatiotemporal autocorrelations, and allows the development of a mathematically rigorous and scientifically meaningful modeling framework by accounting for environmental factors, space, time and epidemic determinants of HPAI diffusion [17] . These studies provide a valuable theoretical basis for applying RS and GIS technologies in analyzing HPAI diffusion.

Proximity to a national highway, proximity to a reservoir, and proximity to a lake are statistically significant environmental factors relevant to the occurrence of HPAI. A strong connection between the proximity to a water body and HPAI outbreaks is apparent, which might be due to the characteristics of bird migration. Water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs are the main stopover sites of migratory birds. The water bodies constitute the flyways of migratory routes and are essential to some species of poultry. When stopover sites of certain migration routes become hosts for the influenza virus, they are the most probable sites for the severe cross-infection of migratory bird groups. When species of poultry are fed traditionally within an environment of a water body and with exposure to infectious wild birds, there is cross-infection between the migratory birds and poultry. To some extent, this persuades us further that migratory birds, mainly waterfowl, are important infection sources of HPAI, while the role of migratory birds in the spread of HPAI has previously been discussed. This study also demonstrates that proximity to national highways is relevant to the occurrences of HPAI. National highways are important transportation routes for poultry trade. The infected poultry would be contagious to other fowl in transportation, trade, and distribution. Even though the prevalence in poultry is considered to be easier to control, the significance of fowl as an infection source should not be ignored.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and future work"}, {"text": "The chosen factors (proximity to a national highway, proximity to a reservoir, proximity to a lake, proximity to a railway, proximity to a river, LST, NDVI, and IWV) have relatively high odds ratios to HPAI occurrence. We attribute these phenomena primarily to the strong connections between a water body and migratory birds and nearby poultry and between transportation routes and poultry. Furthermore, the outbreaks were distributed on maps with 1\u00b0 resolution, and thus, the distance between routes (migratory and transportation) and the overlaid outbreaks would appear to be relatively large, which results in the tolerance of error and higher correlation. Although all of the factors seem useful in the research, autocorrelations between factors should be considered; e.g. locations near reservoirs are always near rivers or lakes. In our study, we chose three factors (prox-imity to a national highway, proximity to a reservoir, and proximity to a lake) to establish our model because they have relatively low P-values. However, there are other, more complicated, factors of the outbreak and spread of HPAI. Spatiotemporal variability could also be interpreted using three determinants. Two outbreaks within 234.5 km are highly correlated. The distance is possibly the distance between two cities for routine poultry trade or the length of bird migration per day. Within this distance, after an occurrence of HPAI, the transportation of birds has a high probability of spreading the virus to traditional markets (which have open access and confined space) and the flight of birds has a high probability of spreading the virus to poultry farms near water bodies (where migratory birds stop over for food and rest). This epidemic spatial range has a 45-km fluctuation due to the different distribution patterns of cities and water bodies. In addition, two outbreaks are likely to occur within 22 d. One important reason for the temporal range is the seasonality of HPAI; outbreaks are always in winter and spring. A period of 22 d in these seasons could be a period of stable climate, which increases the odds of virus infection and diffusion. Even though the clarified delitescence is still controversial, the latent period for HPAI virus survival is longer at lower temperature.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and future work"}, {"text": "Although this study considered the main environmental factors and the migration of birds in assessing HPAI outbreaks and modeled HPAI for a period in 2004, we could not precisely forecast the evolution of HPAI.

In future work, we will explore other factors such as the location and scope of a landform, terrain, wind stress and direction, water body temperature, and particularly the socioeconomic situation.
