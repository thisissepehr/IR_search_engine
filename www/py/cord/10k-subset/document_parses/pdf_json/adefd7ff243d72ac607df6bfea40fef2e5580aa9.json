Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker that can assist in differentiating bacterial vs nonbacterial causes of LRTIs, with elevated levels in acute bacterial infections.

However, it is a safe and effective predictor of bacterial infections, particularly respiratory tract infections [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Despite PCT sensitivity ranging up to 88%, its use must be clinically correlated with other findings, such as physical examination, history, laboratory tests, and diagnostic imaging. Use of multiplex respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays has also been increasing. These tests allow laboratories to quickly detect a wide array of respiratory viruses and select bacteria [11] . While individual test use, particularly PCT, has been well studied, impact on antibiotic therapy varies significantly [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In a study with stewardship intervention for patients on broad-spectrum antibiotics with a respiratory PCR positive for viruses, time to antibiotic de-escalation was not significantly affected [19] . Only a small number of studies have examined PCT and PCR in tandem. Branche and colleagues examined PCT use vs usual care in a randomized trial and found no difference in rates of antibiotic use at 48 hours or less, but subgroup analysis noted a trend toward improvement when PCT and PCR were suggestive of viral illness. There was also a reduction in patients prescribed antibiotics on discharge (20% vs 45%, P = .002) [20] . The results showed promise regarding influencing prescribing and suggested need for further study. A recent report found that PCT plus respiratory PCR results can influence antibiotic duration in viral LRTIs, especially with active antimicrobial stewardship input [21] .

This has been supported by national and global efforts to raise awareness to the significance of this issue. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement an automated clinician antimicrobial stewardship intervention by leveraging EMR-driven data for likely viral LRTIs, defined by negative PCT and positive viral respiratory PCR results. Our intervention was highly effective in reducing antibiotic prescribing, with the BPA decreasing antibiotic-days of therapy by 2.2 days.

A study by Timbrook and colleagues found low rates of antibiotic discontinuation in patients with positive viral respiratory PCR, negative PCT, or both, which were suggestive of viral etiology. Because this study did not include a direct intervention, the authors concluded that clinician intervention was likely needed to affect antibiotic prescribing in this subset of patients [17] . Branche and colleagues implemented a 1:1 randomized feasibility study in similar patients using respiratory PCR and PCT testing. In contrast to the previous study, they employed an intervention to inform providers of likely viral infections, though no difference was found in antibiotic use. However, they did detect a reduction in antibiotic discharge prescriptions by 25%, which is in line with our findings of nearly 28% [20] . They note that they may have encountered a spillover effect, in which their intervention with the study group indirectly influenced the practices of providers in the control group. Our study was able to avoid this as it was carried out in 2 distinct time periods with no overlap. Importantly, the Branche study emphasized the need for provider intervention to leverage diagnostic testing output [20] . A study by File and colleagues evaluated respiratory PCR results coupled with PCR and/or active antimicrobial stewardship intervention. Stewardship input, as compared to availability of PCR plus PCT alone, yielded the most significant reduction in antibiotic use, though this required contact with providers [21] . Our findings suggest that similar efforts can be achieved without direct stewardship input, which allows shifting of efforts to other high-risk patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 616, "end": 620, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1453, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1768, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Benefits of respiratory PCR testing include its rapid turnaround time and inclusion of the most common respiratory viral pathogens.

Providers were willing to stop antibiotics in many cases, with fewer antibiotic-days of therapy and a 37.8% rate of antibiotic discontinuation within 24 hours of the alert firing. While providers may not be willing to immediately discontinue antibiotics in some cases, they may still do so earlier than if they had not been prompted with the initial EMR alert. A question of what factors caused providers to continue antibiotics is raised. In their follow-up analysis of their randomized trial, Branche and colleagues found that while several factors were mentioned by providers as reasons for deviation from their PCT de-escalation protocol including illness severity, fever, abnormal complete blood count, and others, only diagnosis of pneumonia was significantly associated with nonadherence [25] .

Leveraging effective alerts allows stewardship principles to be active all times of the day, meaning patients admitted or evaluated during off-hours or at sites with less antimicrobial stewardship presence still receive the same interventions. While we do not suggest that alerts should replace staffing as many factors contribute to appropriate evaluation of therapy optimization, alerts have been shown to increase appropriate antimicrobial selection [22] . Our study highlights the value of minimally invasive stewardship by allowing the EMR to assist in identifying patient subsets and affecting antibiotic use. Our study did have limitations. First, our evaluation of data from a single health system may not be representative of prescribing of other institutions. Second, the retrospective design did not allow for the most minimally biased comparison between the groups. While our study did attempt to minimize confounding variables, there are always potential unidentified effects. One such effect may have been differences in influenza seasons. The 2017-2018 influenza season was more severe than the 2015-2016 season, as evidenced by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza data [29] . Our regression analysis still supported a significant reduction in days of therapy with the BPA. We began collecting the prospective data immediately after the alert was launched in December 2017, not allowing for an adaptation period to lapse, which may have skewed the true effect of the BPA. Another limitation was nonconsistent timing of the BPA regarding days of therapy. It is possible that earlier firing of BPA led toward earlier discontinuation of antibiotics. However, a temporal relationship cannot be established based on our data alone. A future study might examine how the timing relates to the outcome to further determine BPA effect on antibiotic prescribing. Other limitations to the study included lack of stratification by provider and lack of follow-up on influence of bacterial culture result with therapy duration. It is possible certain providers were inherently more open or resistant to the alert intent, which may lend itself to more targeted feedback in the future when providers decline a suggestion. Other factors beyond PCR and PCT results may have influenced treatment decisions. For example, imaging changes can affect prescriber habits, though imaging alone cannot differentiate bacterial vs viral illness. Another consideration is that our alert does not fire when only respiratory PCR or PCT is suggestive of viral infection, nor does the alert include standalone PCR tests such as influenza or influenza/RSV combination tests. Finally, an issue with the BPA is that it fires for all providers. If one inadvertently selects \"acknowledge\" or \"does not meet criteria, \" the alert stops firing.
