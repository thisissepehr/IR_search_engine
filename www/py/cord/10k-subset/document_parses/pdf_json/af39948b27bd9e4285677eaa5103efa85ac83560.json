After a mosquito takes an infected blood meal, male and female gametocytes are activated in the mosquito midgut to develop into gametes. Fertilization between a microgamete and a macrogamete produces a zygote, which then transforms into a mobile ookinete. The ookinete traverses the mosquito midgut wall and starts sporogonic development in the mosquito. Although the molecular mechanisms of fertilization are poorly understood, this process is a promising target for the interruption of transmission [13] . Several proteins involved in the fertilization process have been identified, including P47, P48/45, P230 and HAP2 [14, 15] . HAP2/Generative Cell Specific 1 (GCS1), first identified in the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Lilium longflorum, is a class II viral fusion protein with a cysteine-rich extracellular region [16] [17] [18] . HAP2/ GCS1 is highly conserved in a wide range of species, such as the green alga Chlamydomonas and Plasmodium [19] . The N-terminus of this protein interacts with proteins expressed on the female gamete, whereas the C-terminus interacts with sperm plasma membrane during fertilization [20] . In Plasmodium, HAP2 protein is located specifically on the surface of activated male gametes [18, 19] . It is an essential component for gamete fusion, since hap2 gene knockout in the rodent parasite P. berghei abolishes fertilization [19, 21] . Recent studies identified a conserved 'cd loop' segment within the HAP2/GCS1 protein, corresponding to amino acids (aa) 174-205 in PbHAP2 and aa 178-207 in P. falciparum HAP2, which is critical for membrane fusion during fertilization [16, 22, 23] . Antibodies raised against 'cd loop' segment of both PbHAP2 and PfHAP2 protein showed evident transmission reduction activity (TRA) in mosquito feeding assays [21, 24] . Meanwhile, like other surface-located vaccine candidate antigens, naturally acquired antibodies against HAP2 are detected in malaria exposed individuals [24] .

In the GMS, the Y133S mutation was fixed or almost fixed, whereas the D637N mutation showed regional differences in prevalence. Difference in regional malaria epidemiology may be held accountable for this divergence in D637N prevalence. Pairwise comparison showed considerable differentiation between China-Myanmar border and western Myanmar populations. Alternatively, this divergence may reflect an evolutionary trend of the parasite populations through time, as the parasites from western Thailand (83.0%), China-Myanmar border (68.3%) and western Myanmar (36.5%) were collected in 2011, 2016 and 2018, respectively.

The maximum likelihood tree was reconstructed based on alignment by ClustalW with bootstrap analyses to assess clade support (500 replicates) using a single consensus sequence for Pvhap2 for 20 haplotypes obtained from China-Myanmar border, Myanmar, Thailand and Iran isolates. The 20 haplotypes were clustered into three main groups, which are shown in blue (Group I), yellow (Group II), and green color (Group III), respectively possible that this longitudinal decrease in D637N prevalence may be associated with host immunity since HAP2 is shown to be naturally immunogenic and antibodies against this protein are present in endemic populations [24] . Interestingly, codon-based selection tests detected positive selection at three codons in the western Myanmar parasites, including codon 637, suggesting potential targeting of these codons by host immunity. Of note, D637N is located in an epitope region (625-651 aa) of the Pvhap2 protein; thus, this mutation may alter the immunogenicity of the HAP2 protein. Future experiments are needed to show whether this amino acid substitution could interfere with fusion function (gamete fusion) or protein recognition by host antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1554, "end": 1558, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Pvhap2 showed lower genetic diversity (ranging from 0.00018 to 0.00075 for all global isolates analyzed) [26] compared to other sexual stage transmission-blocking antigens reported in P. vivax such as pvs28/25 (\u03c0 = 0.0034/0.0013, Yunnan Province of China, [43] ; \u03c0 = 0.0041/0.0023, Myanmar, [44] ), pvs48/45 (\u03c0 = 0.00173, global isolates, [45] ), and pvs230 (\u03c0 = 0.00118, global isolates, [46] ). This high level of conservation may be a consequence of the essential function of this protein in fertilization. Although not significant, the negative value for the d N -d S in nucleotide sequences of pvhap2 gene from the GMS suggests purifying selection may act on this gene. Allele-frequency-based tests further indicate that pvhap2 was influenced by purifying selection. Further, when zoomed in specific regions of the pvhap2 gene, codons under purifying selection were identified in all three GMS parasite populations. This is similar to the gametocyte/gamete-surface antigen pvs230, which appears to be under purifying selection [46] . Another gametocyte/gametes surface protein, pvs48/45, was found to be under positive selection [47] .
