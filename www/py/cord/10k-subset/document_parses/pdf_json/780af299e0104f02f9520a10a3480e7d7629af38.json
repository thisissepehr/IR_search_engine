In addition, when an optimal cutoff of 18.5 was used, APACHE-II score had reasonable sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value in the prediction of drug discontinuation. Taken together, our findings suggest that an APACHE-II score > 18 points might be a useful indicator for predicting patient tolerance of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Adverse reactions caused by anti-tuberculosis drugs are important factors affecting the success of standard therapy for tuberculosis. Previous studies have reported that the total incidence of adverse reactions caused by anti-tuberculosis drugs is 12.6% in China [24] , 12.5% in Portugal [25] , 17.1% in Korea [26] , and 33.6% in Iran [27] . The apparent variation between studies may be related to differences in the incidence of tuberculosis, treatment strategies used or definitions of adverse reactions, as well as other factors. The incidence of adverse reactions in the present study was substantially higher than the average national incidence in China. This is likely due to the patients in our study being critically ill and thus treated in the Department of Tuberculosis Intensive Care Unit. Critically ill patients are likely to have more comorbidities and more severe disease, which would be expected to make them more susceptible to the development of adverse reactions induced by anti-tuberculosis drugs. To our knowledge, the incidence of adverse reactions to anti-tuberculosis drugs in critically ill patients has not been reported previously, either in China or elsewhere.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 987, "end": 991, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1016, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1038, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1063, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Clinical studies have found that the occurrence of adverse reactions to anti-tuberculosis drugs is related to a wide variety of factors, including patient age, patient gender, multidrug-resistance, smoking status, and comorbidities such as HIV co-infection, viral hepatitis and diabetes mellitus [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . In this study, logistic regression analysis identified COPD as an independent factor associated with the withdrawal of anti-tuberculosis treatment in critically ill patients with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis combined with COPD is thought to be the leading cause of death due to respiratory infection [31] . Tuberculosis leads to decreased lung volume and airway stenosis, which are risk factors for the occurrence of COPD, while long-term use of steroids for COPD leads to decreased immune function, which is a risk factor for tuberculosis. Thus, there is an association between tuberculosis and COPD [31, 32] . In this study, the number of patients with COPD and the mortality rate were both significantly higher in the drug withdrawal group than in the therapy completion group, which would be consistent with comorbid COPD increasing the risk of death in patients with tuberculosis, as has been reported previously [33, 34] . The APACHE-II scoring system is the most commonly used method for assessing the severity of critical illness, with a higher score indicating more severe disease. APACHE-II score has been reported to be an independent factor associated with the prognosis of patients with ARDS caused by tuberculosis [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . In the present study, patients in the drug withdrawal group had a significantly higher APACHE-II score than patients in the therapy completion group, and an APACHE-II score > 18 points was an independent factor associated with anti-tuberculosis drug withdrawal in critically ill patients with tuberculosis.

Tuberculosis-associated anemia is a recognized phenomenon but is usually mild and resolves following successful pharmacologic therapy [40] . However, anti-tuberculosis drugs can cause hematologic abnormalities, including anemia, during intensive therapy [41] . It is possible that patients with a lower baseline hemoglobin level before the initiation of treatment are more susceptible to reductions in hemoglobin level caused by therapy, which in turn would make drug withdrawal due to the manifestation of adverse events more likely. Another possibility is that low hemoglobin levels impair the effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis therapy. Consistent with this possibility, anemia was found to be associated with delayed sputum conversion after therapy, and it was suggested that the impaired response to treatment in those with low hemoglobin levels may be due to malnourishment and impaired T cell immunity secondary to zinc and iron deficiency [42] .

Hepatic injury was the most common adverse reaction caused by anti-tuberculosis drugs, as described in other publications [24] . The incidence reported in previous studies vary greatly, from 2 to 28% [27] , possibly due to differences in the criteria used to evaluate liver dysfunction, population characteristics and treatment regimens. The rate of drug withdrawal due to liver damage in this study was 22.7%, similar to that reported previously [43] . Rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide are the main anti-tuberculosis drugs that cause liver damage [44] , which likely explains why the frequencies of withdrawal of these drugs were higher than those of the other drugs in this study. Allergic reactions are also commonly encountered during the treatment of tuberculosis, and the incidence of allergic reactions in this study was similar to the incidence of 3.4-17.8% reported during standard therapy [45] . The allergic reactions reported in this study were mild and mainly manifested as urticaria and drug fever, with no cases of exfoliative dermatitis or bullous dermatitis. The incidence of thrombocytopenia as an adverse reaction of anti-tuberculosis drugs has been rarely reported, although it has been mentioned in case reports [46, 47] . In patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the rate of thrombocytopenia as an adverse reaction to anti-tuberculosis medication was 17.3% [48] , similar to the incidence observed in the present study. It is worth noting that patients with tuberculosis also have immune dysfunction [49] , although the underlying mechanisms need further exploration. Renal dysfunction was a relatively rare adverse reaction in our study, although its incidence was similar to that reported in the literature (7.1%) [50] . Fungal infections cannot be ignored in critically ill patients (since this is known to increase the risk of death), and some patients in this study needed anti-Aspergillus treatment with voriconazole. Since rifampicin is an inducer of CYP450, which reduces the blood concentration of voriconazole, it was discontinued during antifungal treatment. In addition, drug withdrawal in some patients was related to a continuous deterioration in their clinical condition, with worsening respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability.
