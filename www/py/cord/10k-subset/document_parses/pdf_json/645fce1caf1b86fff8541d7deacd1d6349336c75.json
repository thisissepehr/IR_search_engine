Caffeic acid was found to have a direct antiviral effect on influenza A virus in vitro. Caffeic acid was also used for treatment of infections with influenza A virus in mice (R. Pollikoff, personal communication) and in ferrets (K. W. Cochran, personal communication). Of 20 mice given 75 mg of drug/kg per day (perorally), beginning at the time of infection or shortly thereafter, 64% had lung consolidation (vs. 89 % of 30 controls), and 50% survived infection (vs. 13 % of controls); the mean number of days of survival for drug-treated mice was 11.3, compared with 9.1 for controls. Thus this regimen was protective. In 18 ferrets given the same dose of drug by the same route, the opposite effect was observed; fever was noted for a mean of 7.1 days (vs. 5.0 days in nine control animals), and the mean titer of antibody to influenza A virus was 1: 1,990 (vs. 1: 1,760 in controls). These findings suggested that treated ferrets had more viral product than untreated animals. The effect of treatment with caffeic acid in a divided dose of 6 g per day was tested in a controlled trial in antibody-free volunteers. The rate of infection with influenza A2 virus was not changed, but the symptomatic expression of illness among those infected was exaggerated (figure 1). The score for respiratory disease symptoms, beginning after an incubation period of approximately 48 hr and ending six days after challenge, was notably greater in subjects given drug than in controls.

Because rhinoviruses have no known DNA transcription or DNA-dependent phase, studies were made to elucidate a mechanism for the antiviral action.

Of the drugs capable of inhibiting viral replication by interference with macromolecular synthesis, most are too toxic to be considered for antiviral chemotherapy of viral respiratory infections. Nevertheless, some such drugs have been sufficiently safe for use in trials with volunteers. The activity against rhinovirus of a substituted indole-triazine (SKF 30097) was investigated in primary and secondary cultures of human diploid lung fibroblasts (WI-38 cells). In primary tissue cultures, the drug inhibited viral replication at a concentration of 20 ug/rnl; at this concentration cytotoxicity was inapparent. At lower concentrations there was a proportional decrease in the inhibition production of virus. The transfer of harvests to secondary cell cultures in drug-free medium indicated that the action of the drug had prevented or restricted viral replication.

A further difficulty was encountered as a result of side effects of the drug. Approximately one-quarter of the treated volunteers had severe headache that required cessation of the treatment in 10%. This symptom was noted only among subjects given drug, and the frequency was statistically significant compared with that in controls. Unfortunately, although the effective prophylaxis of rhinovirus infections in man confirms the antiviral activity observed in vitro, the drug has no clinical potential because of the absence of therapeutic activity and the production of drug-related symptoms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Controlled Trials in Man"}, {"text": "(4) Amantadine. The prophylactic effectiveness of amantadine (l-adamantanamine hydrochloride) against influenza A has been validated in various test systems. The initial observations in mice, in which a threefold or 75% reduction in the number of deaths from a highly lethal infection was produced [13] , have been reproduced as reductions in frequency of illness and seroconversion in volunteers and in persons observed in field trials [1] [2] [3] [4] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . The effect is consistently one of a 50%-70% reduction in the signs of infection among persons treated prior to exposure, and the significance of the difference in rates of infection is no longer doubted . Acceptance of this conclusion permits examination of other problems in antiviral chemoprophylaxis. The effect of such treatment is most apparent when the incidence and severity of influenza are great ( figure 4) . As the amount of disease in a population declines, the absolute difference between the amount in treated groups and that in untreated groups diminishes. Although the proportional reduction accomplished by prophylaxis is the same, a relatively large number of persons must be treated before the benefit is observed. Thus the cost of the apparently unnecessary prophylactic treatment of many persons may retard recommendation of such a program. Cost, however, is a calculable factor, and the prevention of a few cases of influenza (especially those requiring hospitalization or leading to death) usually establishes a cost-benefit position in favor of prophylaxis. At a ratio of treated cases per case of influenza prevented of 25: 1, the cost for amantadine prophylaxis during epidemic influenza should not be prohibitive.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 302, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 437, "end": 440, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 441, "end": 444, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 445, "end": 448, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 453, "end": 457, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 458, "end": 462, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 468, "end": 472, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 478, "end": 482, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 483, "end": 487, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 488, "end": 492, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 493, "end": 497, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 498, "end": 502, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 912, "end": 921, "text": "figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Controlled Trials in Man"}, {"text": "A more important consideration in the use of a drug for prophylaxis is freedom from toxicity.

The experience accumulated with many patients given amantadine over a long period as treatment for Parkinson's disease has provided reassurance about the safety of this drug regimen [24] . Because of the peculiar pharmacologic properties of absorption and distribution of amantadine, an even safer and more effective regimen for prophylaxis of influenza might be expected from smaller, more frequent doses given initially.

Any measurable titer of interferon in the A88 respiratory secretions at the time of infection greatly lessens the severity of the subsequent illness.

The therapeutic use of interferon may require larger and more frequent doses than prophylactic use.
