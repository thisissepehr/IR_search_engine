Here, we identified tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) as a novel NS3-interacting protein via yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Furthermore, we observed that TRAF6 overexpression significantly inhibited CSFV replication, and TRAF6 knockdown promoted CSFV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages. Additionally, TRAF6 was degraded during CSFV infection or NS3 expression exclusively, indicating that CSFV and TRAF6 were mutually antagonistic and that TRAF6 degradation might contribute to persistent CSFV replication.",

Aside from its serine-protease activity, NS3 possesses helicase and NTPase activities 5, 6 , with autocatalytic cleavage within the CSFV NS3 domain resulting in functional separation of protease and helicase activities 7 . NS3 helicase/NTPase activities are modulated by the NS3 protease domain and NS5B 8 , with CSFV NS3 interacting with NS5B to enhance RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, which can occur through NS3 binding to the two terminal sequences of NS5B through an NS3-protease domain 9, 10 . Additionally, NS3 is an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-binding protein that increases IRES-dependent translation; however, CSFV NS5A and NS5B can reduce NS3-IRES interactions by competitively binding to the same sites in IRES-containing RNA sequences. The inhibitory effect of NS5B on NS3-IRES binding results from NS3-NS5B interactions 11 . Additionally, NS3 accumulation is related to the cytopathic effect (CPE) of CSFV 12 .",

Importantly, TLR3-mediated innate responses induced by poly(I:C) are inhibited in the Shimen infected porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (pMDMs). We also revealed that CSFV Shimen infection of pMDMs leads to the activation of MAPK signalling pathways, while it fails to activate NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, the Shimen infection reduces interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 expression, but enhances IRF7 expression, thereby affecting the production of type I IFN responses 21 . HCV infection suppresses host innate immune response by degrading TRAF6 23 . Among the identified proteins, we chose TRAF6 for further study due to its involvement in the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway and innate immune response. First, we verified interactions between TRAF6 and NS3 by the Y2H system. The yeast strain Y2HGold was co-transformed with the prey plasmid AD-TRAF6 and the bait plasmid BD-NS3 or BD.

Also, TRAF6-Flag and RFP-Flag were detected with a rabbit anti-Flag pAb due to the cross reaction of the 55 kDa heavy chain and 25 kDa light chain of lgG (Fig. 1b) .

Our results indicated no changes in TRAF6 mRNA levels, but lower TRAF6 protein levels coinciding with increases in NS3. The relative levels of TRAF6 protein were estimated by histograms representing density readings of the gel bands, and ratios were calculated relative to \u03b2-actin control (Fig. 3a-c) . To determine whether TRAF6 expression levels are regulated by CSFV infection, mock-and CSFV-infected PAMs were harvested at the selected times to detect TRAF6 expression. We observed no obvious changes in TRAF6 mRNA levels following CSFV infection (Fig. 3d) ; however, TRAF6 protein levels were significantly lower in CSFV-infected cells than in mock-infected cells at 24 and 48 hpi ( Fig. 3e and f) . These findings revealed that CSFV or NS3 altered cellular TRAF6 protein levels without affecting mRNA expression, indicating a role in TRAF6 degradation.

The yeast strain Y2HGold was cotransformed with the prey plasmid AD-TRAF6 and the bait plasmid BD or BD-NS3. Cotransformation with BD/AD, BD-Lamin/AD-T, and BD-p53/AD-T were used as a blank, negative and positive controls, respectively. (b) Exogenous co-IP analysis of NS3 and TRAF6 in PAMs. Cells were cotransfected with plasmids NS3-GFP and TRAF6-Flag. PAMs co-transfected with NS3-GFP and RFP-Flag were used as negative controls. A quarter of the cell extract was subjected to the input assay to assess \u03b2-actin, Flagfusion, and GFP-fusion protein levels. The rest of the extract was subjected to IP assay.

CSFV E rns suppresses the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and cell apoptosis 25 , and CSFV N pro limits type I IFN induction through proteasomal degradation of IRF3 and interaction with IRF7 26, 27 . CSFV NS3 is a multifunctional, non-structural protein that plays a major role in CSFV replication 3, 4, 7 . In HCV, NS3 modulates cell signalling and host-cell responses through its interaction with various cellular proteins, including binding to host apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3G protein to inhibit HCV replication 28, 29 . However, whether CSFV NS3 attenuates the immune response remains unclear. Additionally, no studies are investigating host-cell protein interactions with CSFV NS3. Here we verified 26 host-cell proteins as interacting with CSFV NS3 according to yeast two-hybrid results, with the identified proteins predicted to be involved in metabolism, endocytosis, apoptosis, heat-shock response, and immune response according to bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, TRAF6 was verified as interacting with CSFV NS3 by co-IP and GST pull-down assays. These results provide the empirical foundation for further research on the function of CSFV NS3, and it is the first report that TRAF6 interacts with CSFV NS3. Moreover, we showed that TRAF6 inhibited CSFV replication and that both CSFV and NS3 alone were capable of degrading TRAF6 in PAMs. Additionally, CSFV NS3 is (e,f) LPS does not inhibit CSFV replication in p65-knockdown PAMs. PAMs treated with LPS were transfected with p65-sh2 and infected with CSFV.

TRAF6 downregulation of decreases levels of p-p65 in the lung cancer cell line A549. TRAF6 overexpression is associated with lung cancer tumourigenesis and invasion 32 . Additionally, TRAF6 is a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway 37 . NF-\u03baB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that plays a central role in immunity. Viruses elicit the expression and release of a range of cytokines via the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway as part of the primary host defense mechanism. A previous study reported that CSFV failed to activate the NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway 20, 21 . Our findings showed that TRAF6 overexpression promoted NF-\u03baB activation, and resulted in upregulation of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 expression in PAMs. Moreover, TRAF6 knockdown decreased NF-\u03baB activation induced by poly (I:C) and downregulated IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 expression. IFN-\u03b2, an antiviral cytokine, and IL-6, involved in immune responses, might contribute to the suppression of CSFV replication. The results implied that TRAF6 degradation might play a major role in inhibiting NF-\u03baB-mediated signalling during CSFV infection. These findings agreed with observations that some RNA viruses, such as Sendai virus or vesicular stomatitis virus could induce proteasome-dependent or -independent TRAF6 degradation to impair NF-\u03baB activation and production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines 38 .",

ST cells were infected with the infectious progeny viruses collected from the culture supernatant. At 48-hour post infection (hpi), cells were fixed with 1:1 stationary liquid (methanol: acetone) at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. Following three washes with PBS, the fixed cells were permeated with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. After three washes, the cells were incubated with 5% skim milk powder at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h, followed by incubation with positive CSFV serum at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After three washes, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-pig IgG (whole molecule)-FITC antibody (Sigma, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. Immunofluorescence was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). Mock-infected cells were used as controls to establish background staining levels.",

For the yeast two-hybrid assay, a Matchmaker Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid system (Clontech, USA) was applied to screen the host proteins interacting with NS3. Briefly, the yeast strain Y2HGold transformed with the bait plasmid pGBKT7-NS3 was mated with Y187 containing a PAM cDNA library cloned into the pGADT7-Rec (AD) vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Heterozygotes were plated on double-dropout (DDO) plates lacking Leu and Trp. The clones were then transferred to quadruple-dropout plates lacking His, Leu, Trp, and Ade containing X-alpha-galactosidase (X-\u03b1-Gal) and aureobasidin A (QDO/X-\u03b1-Gal/ Aba) three times. The yeast plasmids were extracted, and the prey plasmids were isolated with ampicillin by transformation into Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1. Sequencing identified the prey plasmids, and the sequences were aligned using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) on the NCBI website against the human non-RefSeq and pig non-RefSeq databases. To confirm the interaction between NS3 and the cellular proteins, Y2HGold was cotransformed with the bait and prey plasmids. The transformants were grown on DDO and QDO/X-\u03b1-Gal/Aba primers Sequence (5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032) Purpose plates. Cotransformation with BD-p53/AD-T (simian virus 40 [SV40] large T antigen), BD-Lam (human lamin C protein)/AD-T, and BD/AD served as positive, negative and blank controls, respectively.",

After 36 h, the cells were washed with PBS and were harvested with Western blot and IP lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) containing PMSF. After centrifugation for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, a quarter of the supernatant was subjected to input assays.

In the prokaryotic expression system, the induction temperature, induction time, IPTG concentration and expressing strains were evaluated for soluble GST-fusion protein. The Pierce GST Protein Interaction Pull-Down Kit (Thermo, USA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, GST or GST-NS3 protein expressed in Escherichia coli was treated with pull-down lysis buffer and then immobilized on equilibrated glutathione agarose resin for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The beads were washed five times with 1:1 wash solution (TBS: Pull-Down Lysis Buffer). Then, HEK293T cell lysates containing TRAF6-Flag were added and were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Protein samples were washed five times followed by elution with Glutathione Elution Buffer. Western blot detected the eluted proteins. GST-TRAF6 expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta and NS3-GFP expressed in HEK293T cells were also used to further verify the interaction between NS3 and TRAF6 in the GST pull-down assay.Construction of stable cell lines exhibiting TRAF6 overexpression or knockdown. HEK293Tcells were co-transfected with 2 \u03bcg CMV-TRAF6 or TRAF6 shRNA along with 0.67 \u03bcg pGag/Pol, 0.67 \u03bcg pRev, and 0.67 \u03bcg pVSV-G plasmids.

After 48 h of incubation, the culture supernatant was centrifuged and was collected as the lentivirus. Lentiviral titres were determined by tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) in HEK293T cells. PAMs in 6-well plates were transduced with the lentiviruses at 10 transduction units per cell, and polybrene was added to enhance infection rate. After 8-10 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and incubation for an additional 48 h. Positive cells were selected with puromycin (Thermo, USA) at 6 \u03bcg/ml final concentration to generate the stable cell lines for TRAF6 overexpression (CMV-TRAF6 cells) or knockdown (TRAF6-sh2 cells).
