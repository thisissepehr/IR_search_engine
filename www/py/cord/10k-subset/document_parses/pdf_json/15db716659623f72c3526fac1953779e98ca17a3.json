We performed a retrospective study where children aged up to 18 years diagnosed to have benign disorders and underwent haplo SCT from 2002 to September 2017 were included. Of the 54 children, the most common indications were Fanconi anaemia 12 (22%), severe aplastic anaemia 8 (14%) and primary immune deficiency disorders (PID) 25 (46%). Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) was used in 41 (75.9%) and ex vivo T depletion in 13 (24.1%). Engraftment rates were 70% with acute graft versus host disease in 36% and cytomegalovirus reactivation in 55% children. There was a statistically significant difference found between survival with siblings as donors as compared to parents (p value 0.018). Overall survival was 60% which is the 1-year survival, with 68% survival among those with PIDs. Cytokine release syndrome was noted in 12/41 (29%) of children who received T replete graft and PTCy. In children over 6 months of age, PTCy at a cost of INR 1200 provides cost effective T cell depletion comparable with TCR a/b depletion priced at INR 1200,000.

The probability of finding a matched family donor is approximately 30%. Therefore, 70% patients require grafts from alternative donors. Matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT has been proven to be a feasible and efficacious alternative to matched family donors. However, MUD transplants carry several disadvantages such as the high cost of procuring stem cells and unreliability of the time required for such procurement. Haploidentical stem cell transplants (haplo SCT) from family donors have the advantage of easy availability of the donor and subsequent decrease in expense. Recent technological advances of T cell depletion have made this form of SCT accessible and feasible. In particular, post-transplant cyclophosphamide as a technique for in vivo T cell depletion, which is significantly less expensive as compared to in vitro T depletion techniques, has provided a ray of hope for several children with life-threatening conditions and conditions that impair quality of life.
