            "text": "Existing methods to infer the relative roles of age groups in epidemic transmission can normally only accommodate a few age classes, and/or require data that are highly specific for the disease being studied. Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to reveal asymmetric transmission patterns between age groups in an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups may dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data are noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5 to 19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were likely the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the USA. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physicianseeking behaviour in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the observed differences in STE.",

Children tend to contribute more to influenza transmission than adults do [1, 4, 7] , but the precise epidemiological roles of different age groups can shift from season to season [9] and may change markedly in pandemic years [10] . From a public health perspective, untangling the relative roles of different age groups could help guide targeted vaccination strategies [7, [11] [12] [13] and other age-related interventions, like the selective closure of schools [14] [15] [16] . However, data with sufficient resolution to identify detailed epidemiological relationships between age groups have so far been scarce, and even when such data exist, current methods are insufficient for reliably uncovering those relationships.",

EMRs are routinely produced by physicians for insurance purposes during the majority of outpatient visits in the USA [17] . Since EMRs generally contain syndromic illness classifications, EMR-based estimates of influenza incidence are subject to noise from non-ILI respiratory infection. EMR-based disease incidence estimates are also subject to geographical and demographic variation in physician-seeking behaviour. Laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, as collected routinely by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [18] , provide more specific estimates of influenza incidence, but at substantially lower volume. Influenza incidence estimates from online search platforms and social media websites like Google [19] and Twitter [20] can provide massive amounts of data, but the reliability of these sources has been called into question, and they lack detailed age information [21] . Dedicated online platforms such as FluNearYou in the USA and FluSurvey in the UK, which gather reports of ILI symptoms from community volunteers [22, 23] , hold some promise for supplementing traditional ILI data streams [24] [25] [26] , but represent a relatively small convenience sample of the population. So, while other data sources exist, EMRs offer a relatively promising and so-far underused source of fine-scale data on influenza incidence in the USA [17, 21] .",

The NGM-based methods have only been applied to scenarios with at most two age groups (children and adults), in part because they require strong assumptions about the structure of the NGM which become increasingly unrealistic as the number of age classes grows. The relative risk method [4, 29, 30] has been used to rank the importance of five age groups for the transmission of influenza, but requires data with high specificity for influenza, effectively precluding ILI data streams and the use of EMRs in particular. These methods are generally aimed at identifying optimal vaccine allocation strategies using data from the initial phase of an epidemic.",

            "text": "Symbolic transfer entropy (STE) [31] offers a way to infer the relative transmission importance of possibly many age groups from ILI data. STE is an extension of transfer entropy (TE) [32] , which measures the amount of information the past states of one stochastic process provide about the transition probabilities of another. Intuitively, the TE is a measure of the amount of information 'transferred' from one stochastic process to another. To compute the STE, a time series is symbolized using a scheme that encodes its qualitative structure in a lowdimensional space, and then the TE is calculated from the relative frequencies of these symbols. The symbolization scheme makes the STE robust to moderate observational noise and to systematic shifts in amplitude, which in the context of EMR ILI data might arise from the presence of non-influenza ILI cases and from differences in reporting rate between age groups. These benefits come with the trade-off of requiring relatively large amounts of data compared to existing methods for inferring the age structure of disease transmission and providing only a relative ranking of transmission importance. STE has been used to study epileptogenic neural signals and the dissemination of information through social networks [31, 33] , but to our knowledge has not been systematically evaluated as a means of providing insight into infectious disease transmission. TE and STE are similar to other model-free methods that measure how information is shared and transferred between possibly coupled dynamic processes, including mutual information [32] , Granger causality [34] , and convergent cross mapping (CCM) [35] . Permutation entropy, a related measure, has recently been used to quantify the predictability of infectious disease outbreaks [36] . Compared to these alternatives, STE offers the advantage of applying in stochastic settings with nonlinear dynamics and moderate observational noise to reveal asymmetric flows of information.",

Motivated by the insight that the relative amplitudes of subsequent observations from these sorts of processes may provide enough information to reveal interactions between them, they propose symbolizing the time series based on ordered m-tuples of observations (electronic supplementary material, figure S1 ). This reduces the (near-)continuous state space of the original stochastic process to a discrete set of m! symbols. In practice, m is often chosen to be 2 or 3, giving a state space of two or six symbols, respectively. For m = 3, we also tested the effect of collapsing the two concave-up and the two concavedown symbols into a single symbol each, resulting in a smaller state space (four versus six symbols) while capturing a similar level of qualitative detail. Details on the symbolization of time series and the empirical calculation of the STE are provided in the electronic supplementary material.",

So, we also define an outbreak simulation model based on a self-exciting Poisson process, similar to [42] . We choose the time units t to match the mean generation interval of the infection, which we set at 3.5 days [43] . To generate epidemics, we use a stepwise-constant effective reproduction number R t , such that R t = 1.5 for the first four weeks (eight generations) of the outbreak and R t = 0.8 thereafter. Infections are binned from the half-week generations into week-long intervals, and additional Poisson noise is added to each bin to simulate non-influenza ILI. For simulations with two age classes, the Poisson model yields epidemics of similar length and magnitude as the two-age-class SIR model (compare electronic supplementary material, figures S7 and S8), and yields comparable STE inferences (figure 1), which suggests that the Poisson model is an acceptable approximation to the stochastic SIR model.

The pairwise STE does not simply reproduce the structure of the relative reproduction matrix, as evidenced by the variability in mean pairwise STE for age groups other than Groups 3-5. This is because the STE captures a 'knock-on' effect for which information transferred from a strongly driving age group can propagate through other age groups.

For the 2009 pandemic, there is a higher maximum pairwise STE and greater variation in the pairwise STEs than for any previous season. This could reflect differences in baseline ILI, which was likely lower during the autumn 2009 pandemic wave than during the seasonal outbreaks, due to the pandemic's earlier timing. A lower baseline ILI might have made pairwise differences in STE easier to detect in 2009.

In addition, re-calculating the pairwise STE using probabilistic reconstructions of the pre-reporting SDI-ILI incidence time series (see electronic supplementary material) indicate that the observed transmission dominance of 5-19 year-olds persists even after adjusting for potential differences in reporting rate between children and adults.

The age groups under 20 years are partitioned such that they span fewer years, and thus contain fewer individuals, than the age groups above 20 years. Direct calculations and simulations (see electronic supplementary material) indicate that, all else being equal, the out-going STE for a given group tends to increase as the group's population size increases relative to the sizes of the other groups. If differences in the groups' population sizes were driving the observed pairwise STE values, we would expect the age groups over 20 years to appear to dominate transmission-which is the opposite of what we observe here.",

            "text": "Here, we propose STE as a means of ranking which age groups contribute most to the transmission of infectious disease outbreaks. STE is chosen over other extensions of TE due to its robustness to point-wise noise and overall amplitude shifts in time series, which especially affect the ILI data stream due to non-influenza respiratory illness and incomplete reporting. Simulation studies indicate that STE can correctly rank transmission asymmetries between age groups. While such a ranking does not provide definitive guidance for targeted interventions, it can provide a useful starting point when other epidemiological information is lacking, as is often the case in emerging outbreaks. STE is positively associated with reporting rates, which can partially confound estimates of asymmetric transmission. STE estimates from ILI time-series data from July-December 2009 in the USA suggest that the transmission of the autumn wave of the A/H1N1pdm pandemic influenza outbreak was likely dominated by [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] year-olds. It is unlikely that this result can be explained by differences in reporting rates alone.",

            "text": "The identification of elevated transmission from schoolaged children during the 2009 influenza pandemic agrees with most other studies on age-specific transmission of both seasonal and pandemic influenza [1, 4, 7, 8] . Elevated transmission from school-aged children is likely due in part to the relatively high number of daily interpersonal contacts made by members of these age groups. Mossong et al. [1] for example estimate that 10-19 year-olds have more contacts per day than any other age group, and conclude from a modelling study based on empirical contact data that [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] year-olds are likely to both suffer the highest burden of disease and to drive the early-stage transmission of an outbreak transmitted by droplets through close contacts, like influenza. This underscores the importance of monitoring children during pandemic influenza outbreaks. We do not recommend using STE alone to set vaccination priorities. STE is shown here to reveal the population structure of transmission, but as a correlation-based measure [45] , it does not provide conclusive evidence that vaccinating high-transmission groups would optimally reduce overall transmission. If high-specificity (e.g. laboratory-confirmed) data are available for a subset of the population, we recommend using STE in tandem with existing risk-based methods [4, 29, 30] to identify optimal intervention strategies. For example, one might use STE to identify epidemiologically relevant partitions of the population (for the 2009 A/H1N1pdm influenza outbreak in the US, these might be <5, 5-19, 20-59, and 60+ years) . Then, using these demographic partitions, one could calculate the relative risk of infection between these coarser groups from the high-specificity data, thereby leveraging the data to its fullest potential.",

Unlike TE, mutual information is symmetric; that is, it measures the probabilistic dependence between two processes, but cannot determine the direction of information transfer between them, if there is any [32] . Measuring the delayed mutual information between two processes is one way to introduce asymmetry. This takes a step towards inferring whether one process influences another, by measuring shared information between the present state of one process and the past states of another [32] . While the lagged mutual information describes how one process history predicts the static probabilities of another, the TE measures how one process history predicts the transition probabilities of another. Because of this, the TE is less likely to be confounded by a shared input signal, and is a better measure of stochastic 'driving' [32] . Section 2 of Kaiser & Schreiber [48] provides a detailed description of the differences between TE and mutual information. Granger causality, on the other hand, is a special case of TE that arises when the stochastic processes are jointly Gaussian distributed [49] . The TE is thus better suited than Granger causality for making inferences on more general, possibly nonlinear, processes, though this comes at the expense of requiring more data and having no clear way to test statistical significance [49] .",

            "text": "CCM [35] was developed to solve a similar problem as TE, but is based on somewhat different underlying theory. CCM was developed to detect so-called causal relationships in partially stochastic systems with underlying deterministic structure. CCM relies on Takens' theorem [50] to reconstruct candidate manifolds of the underlying dynamical system using lagged observations from two-time series. 'Causality' is inferred if nearby points on one reconstructed manifold consistently map to nearby points on the other reconstructed manifold. CCM has been used to provide evidence that temperature and absolute humidity fluctuations drive the timing of global seasonal influenza outbreaks [51] , though some controversy surrounds these findings [52, 53] . Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see whether CCM can reveal asymmetric epidemiological interactions between age groups, and to compare its findings with those identified using TE. Lungarella et al. [54] provide more detail on the relationships between various methods that infer asymmetric relationships from time-series data. As an aside, we prefer to avoid the term 'causality' with respect to these methods, despite its frequent use in the literature. Determination of so-called counterfactual causality, as distinguished from Granger-type causality, requires intervention [55] , which is normally not possible in retrospective epidemiological studies. Regardless of the vocabulary used, the above-listed techniques have successfully revealed fundamental structures in real-world coupled dynamic processes [31, 33, 35, [56] [57] [58] .",

            "text": "Despite the apparent well-suitedness of STE for making inferences from ILI data, its epidemiological relevance currently remains limited. The calculation of STE requires no prior epidemiological information whatsoever, which makes its success somewhat surprising. The NGM [27] is the key object for characterizing age-structured, or more generally population-structured, disease transmission dynamics, and yet there is no obvious direct link between STE estimates and the NGM. It is possible that further simulation studies could help identify such a link; even though the STE values seem to bear little mechanistic meaning apart from the relative ordering of age groups that they yield, it is possible that regressing the inferred STE values on an underlying known NGM could connect the pairwise STE matrix with the NGM under certain conditions. However, it appears unlikely that a simple link exists, especially since STE can say nothing about transmission within a single age group, which is necessary for filling in the diagonal entries of the NGM. STE and related methods such as CCM that do not explicitly incorporate mechanistic descriptions of the underlying physical system are unlikely to be able to reveal more than an approximate hierarchy of transmission strengths. Nevertheless, such a hierarchy can contain valuable information, especially if developing and fitting a mechanistic model is too demanding to be practicable. Certain extensions to STE could also enhance its relevance for epidemiological inference. Local TE [59] and state-dependent TE [60] , like the contextual STE (see electronic supplementary material), are intended to make the TE more flexible and general, by considering how information transfer may change under varying conditions or 'metastates'. Conditional TE [45, 61] takes fuller account of the possible drivers of a given signal which could help to reveal polyadic and synergistic relationships between demographic groups. These extensions may yield better insight into epidemic processes, which are inherently nonlinear and context-dependent, than the more traditional measurements of TE can provide.",

The acceptable range of stochasticity has not been clearly defined. Similarly, it is unclear how best to measure when a difference in STE should be called statistically significant.

A box in row i and column j corresponds to the STE from group j to group i, where darker shades corresponds to higher STE. The reporting rate in each subfigure is constant across groups. The STE values are produced by simulating 100 ensembles of 800 epidemics each from the Poisson model for each value of c and then calculating the between-group STE for each ensemble. The relative reproduction matrix that specifies within-and between-group transmission rates is given by equation(3.3). Mean pairwise STE values between 12 groups for epidemics strongly driven by Groups 3, 4 and 5 and uniform 50% reporting rate across all age groups (a), and for epidemics driven equally by all age groups, 60% reporting for Groups 1-5, and 40% reporting for Groups 6-12 (b). A box in row i and column j corresponds to the STE from group j to group i, where darker shades corresponds to higher STE. To generate the STE values, 100 ensembles of 800 epidemics were simulated from the Poisson model using relative rate matrix electronic supplementary material, Eq. S49 for (a) or a relative rate matrix with all entries equal to 1 for (b). Each ensemble generates 144 pairwise STE values, so that each box represents the mean value across the 100 ensembles.
