Usually acute measles is harmless but complications such as otitis media, pneumonia or acute encephalitis do occur (5) . Also, this virus is associated with a chronic central nervous system disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and is implicated as a possible candidate virus for multiple sclerosis (12) . Normally, in tissue cultures measles virus induces a pronounced cytopathic effect consisting of giant cell formation with intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies. These inclusions are filled with virus material that can be identified by electron microscopy. Such infected cells are destroyed by the virus and do not survive the virus attack. This virus also has the tendency to persist in certain organs or tissue culture systems. Under certain conditions, a virus cell interaction can be established which does not interfere with normal cell metabolism or cell division. Persistently infected cells may not reveal gross morphologic changes which would indicate the presence of measles virus. Only by applying virologic techniques to detect viral antigens, viral genomic RNA or the resistance of superinfection to measles or related viruses can these cultures be identified as persistently infected by measles virus.",

Computer Analysis: As shown schematically in Fig. lD , the digital processing for the LEC, LUB and control cells is divided into several steps. After the interactive segmentation of the cell tissue pictures into single cells, the program calculates the middle-point and the lines of equal distance to the cell membrane (11). The outer ring, whose radius is ?4 the cell radius, is then divided into eight individual sectors (6) (7) (8) . These sectors are labeled a-h in Figure 2A . Experimental results indicate that, for these types of cells, the ring segments contain mainly the cytoplasm; and as a first approximation, the sector i in Figure 2A can be taken to be the nucleus.",

This interpretation was further supported by additional findings obtained using other virologic techniques. Comparison of the virus yield by infected cells demonstrated in LUB cells only 1 plaque forming unit (PFU)/100 cells in contrast to 10 PFU/cell in VERO cells. Biochemical analyses of viral genomic RNA showed in infected VERO cells a profile with a major peak of 50s and a minor peak of 18s RNA (Fig.  4) ; whereas in LUB cells viral RNA sedimented at 18S, 32s and 50s.

            "text": "The analysis of persistent viral infections in animal and man as well as in tissue cultures is of general interest to many disciplines, since this type of virus host interaction may lead to chronic or subacute disease processes. The pathogenetic mechanisms of such diseases are very complex and involve not only host responses to the infection, but depend also on the functional state of the target organ. From a virologic point of view, the primary interest is to identify the infected target cells in order to analyze the virus cell interactions that permit virus persistency. As a consequence of virus replication, virus infection leads to profound intracellular changes. Viral nucleic acids and viral proteins are synthesized intracellularly and may also be deposited in the nucleus. Moreover, certain virus groups have a profound effect on cell metabolism which is quite often not compatible with normal host cell function. Virologic techniques to identify such cells include biochemical and immunologic tests that indicate the presence of virus specific nucleic acids or proteins. These direct assays require the identification of the infectious agents before application. More indirectly histochemical staining procedures are demonstrating viral footprints such as inclusion bodies. Viral structures present in infected cells can also be visualized by electron microscopy; however, this technique is very insensitive and limited in its application.",

With such techniques, distinct subcellular changes have been detected in other fields, such as hematology, genetics or cytology (4, 10). With a sophisticated analytical measurement system and computer algorithms, cytoplasmic and nuclear parameters have been assessed and used in the differentiation of cell classes. It was, therefore, of interest to test the applicability of computer aided cytophotometry in lytically and persistently infected tissue culture cells. As the chosen example of measles virus infection demonstrates, these techniques allow differentiation of infected and uninfected cells by analyzing the intracellular changes as The thick bars indicate the average and the measurement extremia.
