The high vulnerability of women against influenza A virus infections during pregnancy was repeatedly highlighted during influenza pandemics including the pandemic of this century. In 2009, mortality rates were particularly high among otherwise healthy pregnant women. However, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in severe disease development during pregnancy is still very limited. In this review, we summarize the knowledge on the clinical observations in influenza A virus-infected pregnant women. In addition, knowledge obtained from few existing experimental infections in pregnant animal models is discussed. Since clinical data do not provide in-depth information on the pathogenesis of severe influenza during pregnancy, adequate animal models are urgently required that mimic clinical findings. Studies in pregnant animal models will allow the dissection of involved molecular disease pathways that are key to improve patient management and care.",

The clinical course of IAV infections in healthy individuals may vary from mild self-limiting disease to severe disease, which requires hospitalization with occasional lethal outcome. The annual influenza epidemic which peaks during winter in temperate climates is estimated to cause >600 million cases globally, with 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths per year worldwide (www.who.int). Since IAV have a zoonotic origin with an unlimited reservoir in aquatic birds, they may cross species barriers and transmit to humans leading to novel virus variants with an unpredictable outcome. Recently emerged avian IAV belonging to the H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes are responsible for high case fatality rates in humans and pose a future pandemic threat (www.who.int). The influenza pandemic of this century was caused by an H1N1 IAV in 2009-A(H1N1 )pdm09-possessing genomes of avian, swine, and human origin [1] . It is estimated that it has caused~200,000 respiratory and an additional~80,000 cardiovascular deaths predominantly in people younger than 65 years of age [2] .",

Data from previous pandemics such as the 1918 H1N1 and the 1957 H2N2 pandemic as well as from seasonal influenza epidemics revealed that pregnant women have an increased risk in developing complications upon IAV infection [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The pandemic caused by A(H1N1)pdm09 highlighted again that especially pregnant women are at the highest risk to develop severe or even fatal influenza. Data from the USA show that 5 % of the A(H1N1)pdm09-related deaths were among pregnant women, although they make up only 1 % of the total population [9] . This unprecedented very severe disease outcome during pregnancy led to the revision of vaccination recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), setting pregnant women now as the highest priority to be vaccinated again influenza regardless of gestational age.",

            "text": "During pregnancy, women undergo various physiological changes which might contribute to disease severity upon IAV infection. These physiological changes include many metabolic, hemodynamic, and immunologic changes to allow growth and development of the fetus. Metabolic changes occur, e.g., in the glucose and lipid metabolism, and hemodynamic changes include an increase of plasma volume by 1000-1600 ml and alterations in the systemic coagulation system [14] . During pregnancy, there are also specific changes in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the upper respiratory tract, the mucosa of the nasopharynx and oropharynx changes, including hyperemia, edema, leakage of plasma into the stroma, glandular hypersecretion, and increased mucopolysaccharide content. All these physiological changes can result in nasal congestion [15] . The lower respiratory tract is altered due to the elevation of the diaphragm by up to 4 cm and a decrease in functional residual capacity. Functionally, there are changes in lung function, ventilation, and gas exchange, which lead to an increase in oxygen tension required for trans-placental oxygen transfer. Furthermore, changes in the cardiovascular system result in a decrease of pulmonary vascular resistance [15, 16] . All these physiological alterations might be further challenged by respiratory viral infections, such as IAV and, thus, contribute to disease severity during pregnancy.",

Treatment of A(H1N1)pdm2009-associated ARDS included extracorporeal life support, also known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which resulted in a survival rate of~70 % [27] .",

Lung biopsy material was obtained from a 24-year-old pregnant woman without any known underlying diseases who succumbed to the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection after spontaneous expulsion of the fetus [26] . A severe alveolitis with numerous immunohistochemically (red) stained CD68+ macrophages (a) and CD3+ T lymphocytes (b) is observed. At this late stage of infection, influenza virus RNA was not detectable anymore by radioactive in situ hybridization (HE staining) (c). The histochemical stainings were performed according to protocols described before [35] Important host factors for the pathogenesis of influenza in mammals including humans are the distribution of specific influenza virus receptors and nuclear transport proteins, the importin-\u03b1 isoforms [37, 38] which largely determine the cell tropism of influenza viruses within the respiratory tract. Unfortunately, the impact of these cellular factors has not been studied during pregnancy yet. It is therefore currently unknown whether potential alterations in the distribution of receptors or importin-\u03b1 isoforms might contribute to the increased risk of developing complications during pregnancy.",

Moreover, pregnancy has also profound effects on the peripheral immune system outside of the uterus that might interfere with the response against IAV infections [5, 6] . Endocrine adaptation to pregnancy, in particular the elevated levels of estradiol and progesterone, affect cytokine levels as well as their composition and function of peripheral leukocyte populations (reviewed in [6] ). Numbers of peripheral neutrophils, monocytes, as well as myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) are reduced [39] . Upon in vitro stimulation, both NK cells and CD4 T cells produce reduced amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, reduced cytokine production by CD4 T cells includes both T H1 (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) and T H2 cytokines (IL-6, IL-13) [39] arguing against a shift in the T H1 -T H2 balance during pregnancy as has been postulated from mouse studies [40] . DCs from pregnant women also display higher expression of costimulatory surface molecules, such as CD40, CD80, and CD86, than those of non-pregnant women suggesting a more mature status of DCs [41] [42] [43] . It should be mentioned that results on the phenotype and function of immune cells during pregnancy differ considerably between individual studies. Our understanding of immunity during pregnancy would clearly benefit from more systematic and comprehensive approaches using advanced methodology to better define and characterize immune cell subsets.",

As stated before, complications in pregnant women are similar to those observed in other risk groups, arguing for potentially common mechanisms that mediate disease severity. There is evidence that immunopathology strongly contributes to severe courses of IAV infections [49] . High virus titers in the lung, which might represent a consequence of reduced production of type I and type III interferons in pregnant women [50] , could cause excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and massive infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages which subsequently cause severe tissue damage. Altered production of inflammatory cytokines as well as differences in the composition and response of peripheral immune cells in pregnant women could contribute to such an exacerbated response against IAV [6] . However, so far, there is no direct evidence supporting such a scenario. Patients with severe IAV infections show lower serum levels of IgG2. Healthy pregnant women also have low levels of serum IgG2, and levels are further reduced in pregnant women with severe IAV infections [51] [52] [53] . Yet again, the contribution of low serum IgG2 levels to severe courses of infection in pregnant women is not clear. Overall, it is currently not known why pregnant woman are more prone to develop severe courses of disease upon IAV infections.",

IAV infections have been associated with an increase in perinatal mortality, preterm birth, cesarean section, and a low Apgar score 5 min after birth [9, [54] [55] [56] . In addition, infection with IAV within the first trimester of the pregnancy increases the risk by twofold on non-chromosomal congenital anomalies, such as neural tube defects, hydrocephaly, congenital heart defects, cleft lip, digestive system defects, and limb reduction defects [57] . Viral antigen has been detected in the amniotic fluid (H3N2 virus; [58] ) and in fetal tissue (H5N1 virus; [36] ). However, in the majority of cases, IAV could not be isolated from the placenta or fetus [31, 59, 60] .

Compared to infection of mice with seasonal H1N1 strains, infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 resulted in more severe interstitial pneumonia with massive cellular infiltrations, and lung pathology was further aggravated when pregnant mice were infected [63] . Compared to non-pregnant mice, pregnant mice infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 IAV demonstrated enhanced accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in lung tissue and BAL fluid, and increased local NO production [64] . As expected, infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 was associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in the lung when compared to infection with seasonal H1N1 IAV [63] . In comparison to non-pregnant mice, pregnant animals had enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) as well as neutrophil-and monocyte-recruiting chemokines in BAL fluid and lung tissue, which was consistent with the fulminant accumulation of these cells in the lung [62, 64] . In contrast to the profound changes in the innate response to IAV infections, the adaptive response appeared to be less affected by pregnancy. Pregnant and non-pregnant mice generated similar frequencies of influenza virus-specific CD8 + T cells and these cells showed comparable activation, as indicated by CD69 expression, and accumulation in the infected lung [64] . Pregnant mice also mounted strong antibody responses against A(H1N1)pdm09, although in one study, titers of antibodies were reduced compared to non-pregnant mice [62, 64] . Overall, these studies indicate that disease severity in pregnant syngenically mated mice upon A(H1N1)pdm09 IAV infection is mainly due to enhanced cytokine production in the lung and massive recruitment of innate immune cells which results in severe tissue damage.",
