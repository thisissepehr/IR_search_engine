Due to the severe impairment of the respiratory mechanics, the fibrotic lung is at high risk of developing ventilator-induced lung injury, regardless of the lung fibrosis etiology. The purpose of this review is to analyze the effects of mechanical ventilation in AE-ILD and to increase the knowledge on the characteristics of fibrotic lung during artificial ventilation, introducing the concept of \"squishy ball lung\". The role of positive end-expiratory pressure is discussed, proposing a \"lung resting strategy\" as opposed to the \"open lung approach\". The review also discusses the practical management of AE-ILD patients discussing illustrative clinical cases.",

Many patients with ILD can develop an acute exacerbation in the course of the disease (AE-ILD), and often require ICU hospitalization and mechanical ventilation (MV). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and severe form of idiopathic ILD, often worsened by acute exacerbation episodes (AE-IPF). During these dramatic events, the typical usual interstitial pneumonia pattern (UIP)-the radiologic and histologic hallmark of IPF is overlapped with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), sharing similarities with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3] . Little is known about the outcome of latter patients receiving MV, and the influence of the extent of lung fibrosis component on ventilator management [4] .",

            "text": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of a complex network of protein structures (collagen, fibronectin, elastin, glycoproteins and proteoglycans), which play a crucial role in determining the mechanical stability and elastic recoil of the lung. The ECM is a dynamic structure, constantly remodeled by enzymatic processes. In the fibrotic lung, there is a dysregulation of this remodeling process, with imbalance between protein secretion and degradation, with an increase in the deposition of collagen, elastin, proteoglycans and fibronectin [5] . Considering that the main stress-bearing constituents of lung tissue are collagen and elastin fibers, their quantitative and architectural modification can influence the elastic recoil of the lung. Elastin and collagen differ significantly in their mechanical properties. In fact, elastin is responsible for elasticity, especially at low stress levels, and can be stretched by more than 250% of its original length before breaking, while collagen is more rigid and significantly less stretchable being extendable only by 1-2% compared to the initial length [6] . Collagen fibers, which in the resting position are folded, are stretched only at high pulmonary volumes, close to the total lung capacity, and act as a blocking system determining the limitation of distention of the lung, and the origin of the curvilinear stress-strain relationship [7, 8] (Fig. 1) . Therefore, elastin fibers are the main determinants of the maximum pulmonary volume that can be reached during inflation, beyond which there is a risk of barotrauma and volutrauma due to the breakdown of collagen fibers. This concept can be applied not only to the entire lung, but also to the different lung regions that have their maximum total regional capacity [7] . This is particularly relevant in the fibrotic lung, where the composition of the ECM has a high regional heterogeneity. In IPF, collagen fibers accumulate around myofibroblasts in fibroblastic foci, stiffening the corresponding regions [9] .",

The histopathological hallmarks of the UIP pattern are spatial heterogeneity, temporal heterogeneity with fibroblastic foci and micro-honeycombing. Spatial heterogeneity is defined as the presence of areas of normal tissue interposed to areas with fibrotic alterations. Temporal heterogeneity is the concomitant presence of areas with only slight modifications of the ECM structure and proliferative fibroblast and myofibroblasts aggregates, adjacent to areas of intense fibrosis composed of dense acellular collagen, indicating different Relationship between stress and strain in healthy, ARDS and fibrotic lungs. The specific elastance (K) is the slope of the curve in its linear portion. Although ARDS lungs are characterized by low compliance, its elastic properties follow those of healthy lungs provided that the deformation induced by tidal ventilation is normalized to the end-expiratory lung volume. In ARDS, the \"baby lung\" (gray area) inflates until a certain level where hyperinflation occurs and the linearity of the stress-strain relation is lost, approaching the breakdown limit of the extracellular matrix constituents (lightning). In fibrotic lungs, the specific elastance is higher thus the stress-strain curve is steeper. During inflation, the healthy regions protrude through the fibrotic walls, as illustrated by the hand progressively squeezing the \"squishy ball\". Compared to ARDS, the breakdown is reached at lower stress and lower strain.

Honeycomb lesions are areas consisting of dilated air spaces with anelastic walls of epithelium-coated fibrous tissue [10] .

When the squishy ball is compressed, the increase of the pressure inside the object causes throttling of the elastic part of the body through the inelastic net that wraps the ball. The result is the formation of vesicles that protrude outside the net mesh, until reaching the elastic limit. The \"squishy ball effect\" in some areas of the lung may be the cause of mechanical disadvantages achieved using high P airway and P L in the lungs with fibrosis and could confirm the role of static strain in generating VILI.

In several clinical settings, ICU physicians tend to be reluctant to admit IPF patients if they are not already listed for transplant, considering invasive ventilation as a bridge-totransplant therapy [16] . Nevertheless, evidence shows that also patients with ILD other than IPF may present with acute exacerbation during the natural course of the disease [33] requiring ICU admission and MV [15, 33, 34] . Autopsy studies show that the majority of patients who died from AE-ILD other than IPF often present with a DAD superimposed on a UIP pattern at the histologic examination, resembling what usually is found on biopsies of patients that died from AE-IPF [34, 35] . The presence of a UIP pattern on histology is strictly correlated with peculiar features on CT scan, namely radiological UIP pattern [33] . Therefore, intensivists should be able to promptly recognize the UIP pattern at the CT scan, as it is the main determinant of the squishy-ball behavior of the fibrotic lung subject to MV.",

The ultimate guidelines on diagnosis of IPF defined the typical radiographic features of UIP pattern on CT. The radiologic hallmark of UIP is the presence of honeycombing, multiple layers of subpleural clustered cystic airspaces with thick, well-defined walls and typically consistent diameter (3-10 mm, but occasionally larger). A fine reticular pattern containing traction bronchiectasis ranging from subtle irregularity of the bronchial/bronchiolar wall to marked airway distortion and varicosity is another key feature of UIP pattern. The typical distribution of these abnormalities follows a cranio-caudal gradient with sub-pleural predominance [36] . Ground-glass opacifications as defined by hazy increased opacity of lung airspaces with substantial preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins on CT, represent the usual radiological appearance of inflammatory alveolar abnormalities, including DAD [37] but may be also present in patients with ILD [38] . When ground-glass opacifications result superimposed on a fine reticular pattern surrounded by traction bronchiectasis they should be referred to alveolar fibrosis and might identify a subgroup of patients at extremely high risk of VILI [39] . In summary, in the context of ILD of different etiology, the presence of a UIP pattern identifies a mechanical substrate more prone to VILI as a consequence of the \"squishy ball\" behavior. In this setting a lung resting approach might be preferable to prevent possible damages. In AE-ILD patients with ground-glass abnormalities in the absence of significant UIP pattern, mechanical behavior of the lung might be similar to ARDS.",

All patients presented a UIP pattern with superimposed ground-glass opacities on the CT scan (Fig. 3a) . Patients were nonobese males (body mass index, mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 22.8 \u00b1 2.3 kg/m 2 ), aged 62.6 \u00b1 9.1 (age at diagnosis 60 \u00b1 8.5 years).

Table 1 shows respiratory mechanics and gas exchange parameters of these patients, when PEEP was set according to a \"lung resting strategy\" (minimal PEEP level of 4 cmH 2 O) and after PEEP titration on an \"open lung approach\" aiming at achieving positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure values. In all patients, with minimal levels of PEEP aimed at achieving minimal acceptable oxygenation, end-expiratory P L was negative. This suggests that even in the fibrotic lung with diffuse alveolar damage tidal de-recruitment of the dependent zones during the expiration might occur. Nevertheless, in these patients a PEEP titration strategy to maintain a positive end-expiratory P L resulted in a significant mechanical disadvantage. In these patients, higher PEEP levels lead to an increase in the driving pressure, lung elastance and end-inspiration P L values. This suggest that PEEP is able to counteract alveolar recruitment-derecruitment, but at the price of a remarkable lung parenchymal stress. The mechanical disadvantages determined by high PEEP, suggests that in the fibrotic lung with diffuse alveolar damage, the static strain might play a relevant role.",

Although ARDS lungs are characterized by low compliance, its elastic properties follow those of healthy lungs provided that the deformation induced by tidal ventilation is normalized to the end-expiratory lung volume. In ARDS, the \"baby lung\" (gray area) inflates until a certain level where hyperinflation occurs and the linearity of the stress-strain relation is lost, approaching the breakdown limit of the extracellular matrix constituents (lightning). In fibrotic lungs, the specific elastance is higher thus the stress-strain curve is steeper. During inflation, the healthy regions protrude through the fibrotic walls, as illustrated by the hand progressively squeezing the \"squishy ball\". Compared to ARDS, the breakdown is reached at lower stress and lower strain. ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, V T tidal volume, EELV end-expiratory lung volume, P L transpulmonary pressure",
