The reasons were as follows. Twitter Search API allows queries against the indices of recent or popular tweets and behaves similarly to, but not exactly like the Search feature available in Twitter mobile or web clients, such as Twitter.com search. Twitter Search API is based on relevance but not on completeness. Furthermore, Twitter sets restrictions on how old one can grab the data from its API. Twitter Search API searches against a sampling of recent Tweets published in the past 7 days. 1 Twitter also sets a limit on the number of requests one can make in a time period. Twitter allows the user only 180 requests per 15-minute window. 2 Thus, the process of tweet extraction is limited by these limits set by Twitter.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Web scraping to retrieve tweets' ID. To retrieve Twitter data older than two weeks, we relied on web scraping.

On the Twitter website using Twitter Advanced Search, users can scroll as much as they want and read the tweets even as old as five years old.
