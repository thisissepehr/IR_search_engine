Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians who played direct roles during the Hurricane Sandy ICU evacuations. Results: Sixty-eight health care professionals from 4 evacuating hospitals completed surveys (35% ICU nurses, 21% respiratory therapists, 25% physicians-in-training, and 13% attending physicians). Only 21% had participated in an ICU evacuation drill in the past 2 years and 28% had prior training or real-life experience. Processes were inconsistent for patient prioritization, tracking, transport medications, and transport care. Respondents identified communication (43%) as the key barrier to effective evacuation. The equipment considered most helpful included flashlights (24%), transport sleds (21%), and oxygen tanks and respiratory therapy supplies (19%). An evacuation wish list included walkie-talkies/phones (26%), lighting/electricity (18%), flashlights (10%), and portable ventilators and suction (16%). Conclusions: ICU providers who evacuated critically ill patients during Hurricane Sandy had little prior knowledge of evacuation processes or vertical evacuation experience. The weakest links in the patient evacuation process were communication and the availability of practical tools. Incorporating ICU providers into hospital evacuation planning and training, developing standard evacuation communication processes and tools, and collecting a uniform dataset among all evacuating hospitals could better inform critical care evacuation in the future.

            "text": "T he published experience of health care providers involved in disasters over the past decade has repeatedly emphasized the importance of planning, preparation, and evacuation procedures in these situations. Critically ill patients are especially vulnerable during disasters, because they are both medically fragile and their care and evacuation require special equipment and expertise. Insufficient coordination of resources and patient monitoring during movement of critically ill patients are often cited as reasons for clinical deterioration during transport. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Simulation of patient preparation and transport using actual transport equipment increases the likelihood of successful individual evacuation performance as well as system-wide cooperation. 6, 7 Little is known about provider preparedness or the performance of effective and safe evacuation of critically ill patients during disasters. Intensive care unit (ICU) providers rarely consider the challenges of moving a critically ill patient within or outside of the hospital in the event that their ICU is rendered incapable of supporting appropriate ongoing care. Although ICU providers are familiar with horizontal transport (moving ICU patients laterally on the same floor), they are less familiar with vertical transport (moving patients either up or down floors), especially in disaster situations that require transport up or down stairs. Although many patients have common critical care requirements (such as mechanical ventilation or vasopressor infusion) that would be routine for most receiving hospitals, some patients require specialized care that may exceed the capability of transport teams and receiving locations (eg, extracorporeal life support [ECLS] , intracranial pressure management, and microprematurity neonatal care). Deliberate planning is the only way to appropriately address the complex challenges that ICU providers may face in a disaster.",

These facts allowed us to analyze our survey with some confidence to identify important associations and lessons that may help to inform future ICU evacuation practices. Although it has been suggested that practical equipment is integral to evacuation successes, ours is also the first study to highlight that flashlights, water, walkie-talkies, and other specific \"wish list\" items may be just as important as (if not more so) complicated ICU-specific equipment (such as transport ventilators). 17 These small, simple tools may play a more significant role in successful ICU evacuations than previously appreciated and ICUs should be included in basic disaster tool planning.",

Although most institutions surveyed had participated in regional evacuation planning and had significant advance warning of Hurricane Sandy's landfall, leadership coordination and communication remained significant problems. Triage and prioritization decisions for ICU patient evacuation were generally still determined locally, and most providers performing these activities were not designated leaders and had little or no practical training. It is significant to note that institutional evacuation planning may not always involve the ICU director, because disaster preparedness efforts are often focused on the emergency department. This may create a management challenge for critically ill patients, who are generally the most vulnerable during an evacuation and frequently require specific subject matter expertise to effectively deliver their complex care.

If a decision is made to continue working with disaster forms, the staff should undergo appropriate training and routinely practice the use of these forms. Detailed planning and realistic drills using likely disaster scenarios increase successful individual performance. 30, 38 Communication and leadership are frequently cited challenges to effective ICU management and evacuation following a disaster. The experience from survey respondents following Hurricane Sandy highlights the importance of a critical care team or unit leader, who can maintain real-time situational awareness of the quantity, severity, resource requirements, special equipment, and transport needs of multiple critically ill patients and communicate this Our survey did not delve into specific assessment of posttraumatic stress or dysfunction. We highlighted some of the ethical obstacles identified by providers, but did not address their functional status or stress symptoms at the time of the survey, which would have been a ripe opportunity to assess long-term effects of such evacuations. We also did not allow providers to self-rate their performance in terms of patient care, although responses in support of excellent patient safety outcomes indirectly addressed this. A complete description and analysis of the complex events and ICU evacuation responses following Hurricane Sandy is clearly not possible by using a simple survey tool. Owing to financial limitations and sheer geographic distance, we were forced to conduct our study remotely. A major limitation to our study was the participation of only 4 of 7 area hospitals affected by this storm, and the associated risk of selection and response biases. Although we attempted to highlight a variety of subspecialty ICU types, we primarily captured responses from medical ICUs as a result of the sampling methods. Future studies could aim to provide more responses from neonatal, pediatric, medical, cardiac, and other ICUs.",

Even among the hospitals that agreed to participate, we encountered significant limits to available data due to respondent concern regarding the appropriate use of this information. Outside providers, such as emergency medical services or purely administrative staff, were not queried but might provide a different perspective on the events. By definition, data collected in a disaster situation are frequently limited and nonuniform, raising concerns regarding the public relations and medical-legal ramifications of submitting this information to public scrutiny. Developing clear guidelines for minimum elements of data collection to consider in these situations and an anonymous reporting system at the national or international level may help to facilitate more comprehensive study and understanding of best practices for ICU evacuation that may aid providers and improve patient outcomes in future disaster events.",

            "text": "The experiences shared by ICU providers involved in the response to Hurricane Sandy identified themes common with other published literature in this area. Disaster planning and preparation at the ICU level continues to represent an area for improvement, especially in the area of vertical evacuation. Early initiation of patient evacuation efforts led to greater communication and coordination both within and between hospitals, but still left room for improvement in the areas of communication and leadership, especially in the area of patient distribution. Triage, prioritization, and documentation processes were highly variable, and emergency credentialing was frequently necessary to provide patients with the care that they needed during and after transport to new facilities. Phones, flashlights, and portable ventilators are important, high-yield resources that could be targeted for preparation in the event of future ICU evacuations. Many other areas for improvement above could be addressed by better efforts to incorporate ICU providers into hospital evacuation planning and training efforts. A possible solution to improve the ICU processes observed in this event includes the creation of standardized evacuation communication processes and documentation tools, managed by a critical care unit leader who coordinates care and plays a defined and integrated role in the Incident Command System. The development of a standard, uniform database utilized by all evacuating hospitals during a disaster could also better inform patient and system outcomes to further advance critical care evacuation practices in the future.
