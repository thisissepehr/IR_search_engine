            "text": "Biliary atresia (BA) is a neonatal obstructive cholangiopathy that progresses to end-stage liver disease, often requiring transplantation. The murine model of BA, employing rhesus rotavirus (RRV), parallels human disease and has been used to elucidate mechanistic aspects of a virus induced biliary cholangiopathy. We previously reported that the RRV VP4 gene plays an integral role in activating the immune system and induction of BA. Using rotavirus binding and blocking assays, this study elucidated how RRV VP4 protein governs cholangiocyte susceptibility to infection both in vitro and in vivo in the murine model of BA. We identified the amino acid sequence on VP4 and its cholangiocyte binding protein, finding that the sequence is specific to those rotavirus strains that cause obstructive cholangiopathy. Pretreatment of murine and human cholangiocytes with this VP4-derived peptide (TRTRVSRLY) significantly reduced the ability of RRV to bind and infect cells. However, the peptide did not block cholangiocyte binding of TUCH and Ro1845, strains that do not induce murine BA. The SRL sequence within TRTRVSRLY is required for cholangiocyte binding and viral replication. The cholangiocyte membrane protein bound by SRL was found to be Hsc70. Inhibition of Hsc70 by small interfering RNAs reduced RRV's ability to infect cholangiocytes. This virus-cholangiocyte interaction is also seen in vivo in the murine model of BA, where inoculation of mice with TRTRVSRLY peptide significantly reduced symptoms and mortality in RRV-injected mice. Conclusion: The tripeptide SRL on RRV VP4 binds to the cholangiocyte membrane protein Hsc70, defining a novel binding site governing VP4 attachment. Investigations are underway to determine the cellular response to this interaction to understand how it contributes to the pathogenesis of BA.

            "text": "B iliary atresia (BA) is an inflammatory cholangiopathy unique to infancy and is the most common cause of pathologic jaundice in the pediatric population, leading to extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Surgical reconstruction of the extrahepatic biliary tree may restore drainage in some; however, many infants progress to cirrhosis and end stage liver disease. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, BA is the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation in the United States. (1) The etiology of BA remains unclear. In 1974, Landing proposed that a viral insult leads to a progressive inflammatory process, resulting in cholangiopathic disease. (2) Subsequent studies found multiple viruses including rotavirus group C, (3) reovirus type 3, (4) Epstein-Barr virus, (5) cytomegalovirus, (6) and human papillomavirus (7) in explanted livers of infants with BA. In a murine model of BA, rhesus rotavirus (RRV) infection of newborn BALB/c mice resulted in obstructive cholangiopathy, (8, 9) the symptoms of which included bilirubinuria, jaundice, acholic stools, and growth retardation that mirrored the human form of the disease. (9) In this model, the morphologic and histologic changes in the biliary tree (10) parallel those found in human BA. (8) Rotaviruses, including RRV, are 65-to 75-nm icosahedral, nonenveloped viruses containing 11 doublestranded RNA gene segments encoding six structural proteins (VP1-4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural (NSP1-6) proteins. The outer layer is comprised of a protein capsid consisting of VP4 and VP7 proteins, which are involved in cellular binding. (11) In previous studies, we found that one of the cellular targets of RRV is the biliary epithelial cell (cholangiocyte). (12) The mechanism by which RRV attaches to a host cell is a multistep process involving sialic acid labeled glycoproteins (13, 14) and the integrins a2b1, a4b1, aVb3, and aXb2. (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) We have shown previously that expression of the a2b1 integrin plays a role in cholangiocyte susceptibility to RRV infection. (21) Although blocking of the a2b1 integrin reduced cholangiocyte vulnerability by 50%, RRV was still able to infect the cell, suggesting the existence of other, undefined cholangiocyte cell surface receptors that may govern susceptibility.",

Computer-aided analyses were performed to identify potential protein-protein interaction sites on the RRV VP4 protein.

            "text": "Once it was determined that the TRTRVSRLY peptide plays a role in RRV binding and cholangiocyte infection, the next objective was to identify the specific aa within this 9 aa peptide responsible for these functions. RRV and Ro1845 440-448 peptides differ by two aa. We synthesized peptides with each of those single aa changes (MRTRVSRLY, TRTRVSGLY) to evaluate the region of the peptide critical in binding and replication. Altering aa 440 (T!M) had no impact on inhibition of binding and replication, with both TRTRVSRLY and MRTRVSRLY significantly inhibiting RRV function. However, alteration at peptide 446 (R!G) inhibited the peptide's ability to block binding and replication (Fig. 4A,B) . This result suggests that the critical portion of the 9 aa sequence lay within the last five residues. We then investigated the latter half of the TRTRVSRLY sequence to determine which aa govern the peptide's function. Peptides measuring 5 aa were synthesized with single aa changes at each position of the VP4 VSRLY sequence. Assaying rotavirus binding and replication revealed that peptides VRTRISGLY had no effect on binding or replication in RRV, TUCH, or Ro1845. In all strains, DGEA (positive control) significantly inhibited both viral binding and replication compared with media-only control. Treatment with TRTRVSRLY significantly reduced RRV binding and viral yield with no effect on other rotavirus strains. *P < 0.05 versus serum-free media pretreatment.",

            "text": "BA is a devastating disease, affecting newborns in the first months of life. It is characterized by bile duct obstruction, liver injury, progressing to fibrosis and without treatment, death. Although the etiology of BA remains unclear, perinatal viral infection has been implicated in its pathogenesis. (33) Several viruses, including rotavirus, may play a role in the activation of both inflammatory and autoimmune pathways. (34) In the murine model of BA, RRV contributes to a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell activation. (35, 36) Although the exact mechanism through which rotavirus plays a role has not yet been elucidated, current studies indicate that the virus targets biliary epithelium, leading to inflammation and extrahepatic biliary obstruction. (12, 35) We have shown previously that the VP4 gene of RRV plays an integral role in the murine BA model induction through cholangiocyte infection (22) and immune cell activation. (23) In 1997, Coulson et al. (15) discovered the collagen peptide-binding sequence DGE on rotavirus. This was then determined to bind the a2b1 integrin on cholangiocytes. This receptor, used in primary rotavirus binding, was not found on hepatocytes or Cho cells, less susceptible lines, suggesting that other receptors may govern RRV infectivity. (19) Using sequence and structure based modeling approaches, we determined three peptide sequences within the RRV VP4 protein that map into putative protein-protein binding sites. Through selective treatment with these peptides (PTAAGV, TRTRVSRLY, SSASAW), we determined that only TRTRVSRLY (aa 440-448) was able to decrease RRV binding and subsequent replication in murine cholangiocytes along with MA104 cells, and that the cell type rotavirus replicates efficiently. This peptide was only capable of inhibiting RRV and GRV, two strains with homologous TRTRVSRLY sequences, both of which can induce murine BA. However, it was not capable of inhibiting binding of TUCH and Ro1845, viruses with dissimilar peptide sequences that cannot induce murine BA. This result suggests that TRTRVSRLY is an essential peptide that plays a role in RRV-specific cellular binding. Within the TRTRVSRLY sequence, it was determined that the 3-aa sequence SRL plays a critical role. This established an RRV-specific peptide that governs binding and entry and is specific to rotavirus strains capable of inducing murine BA. (15) To determine the role of the RRV TRTRVSRLY peptide in human BA, we performed similar experiments in human cholangiocyte cells (H69 cells). Through this analysis, we determined that the TRTRVSRLY peptide is also capable of diminishing both RRV and GRV binding and viral replication, both strains capable of inducing the murine model of BA. It is important to note that there has been human rotavirus strains isolated which contain the TRTRVSRLY sequence in their VP4 protein. (37, 38) Unfortunately, these strains were not maintained and as a result, are not available for study.",

            "text": "Following determination of SRL specificity, we sought the corresponding cholangiocyte membrane receptor for this peptide. We found that in cholangiocytes, SRL attachment occurs through the Hsc70 protein. Hsc70 is a constitutively expressed chaperone within the Hsp70 family. This protein is involved in various cellular functions, including uncoating during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, (39) protein folding, (40) protein degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, (41) and the import of proteins into organelles. (42) This protein is also up-regulated during inflammation, infection, and malignant processes. (39) Interaction with antigen-presenting cells through LRP1/CD91 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) may result in translocation of nuclear factor jB1 into the nucleus and dendritic cell maturation. (43) Rotavirus cell entry has been shown to be a complex, multistep process with various cellular receptors, including integrins and Hsc70. (44, 45) Hsc70 is present on the cell surface of multiple rotavirus-susceptible and nonsusceptible cell types, including monkey MA104 and human Caco-2 cells and is believed to be essential to infection in susceptible cells. When blocked with antibodies, the ability of rotavirus to infect the cell is diminished. (30) The Hsc70 protein has been shown to be involved in secondary rotavirus binding through a post-attachment step (17, 30, 45) by way of the peptide sequences KID (642-658) and FSG (531-554). (31, 32) The rotavirus capsid protein, composed of VP4 (later cleaved into VP5 and VP8) and VP7, is responsible for initial cell interaction. VP4 has been shown to play an essential role in cellular binding and attachment. (45) Previous investigations of aa sequences within the VP4 protein by Zarate et al. (32) provided knowledge that specific Hsc70 binding occurs through the KID (aa 642-658) domain on VP5. Blocking this domain impedes viral replication, though not binding, suggesting that this is a secondary binding site. Similarly, Gualtero et al. (31) showed the FSG peptide (aa 531-554) within VP4 is implicated in Hsc70 binding and also plays a role in rotavirus replication, though not primary binding. Through our investigation of the TRTRVSRLY peptide, we determined that this unique peptide, unlike previously described peptides, interacts with Hsc70 during the primary binding phase of the VP4 domain of RRV, whereas the previously established peptides are involved in a post-attachment step. Thus, blocking Hsc70 through siRNA had a significant effect in blocking RRV binding. Replication of RRV, however, was similar to that of previous reports and was inhibited not only by TRTRSVRLY but also the KID and FSG peptides. (30, 32) Studies are underway to elucidate these differences.",
