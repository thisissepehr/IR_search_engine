Viral infections are thought to be the predominant cause of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults, but the precise ratio of viral causes to bacterial causes is not known. Numerous viruses have been implicated as causing acute bronchitis, including influenza viruses and adenoviruses,10.l i respiratory syncytial virus (RSV}, u,12 and the common cold viruses such as rhinoviruses, 11 and (less frequently) coronaviruses.13 Measles14 and herpes simplex virus la may also cause bronchitis, and are associated with particularly severe cases.

Unfortunately, the characteristic \"whoop\" is usually lacking in adults, 17 so pertussis is rarely considered as causing bronchitis unless the patient gives a history of contact with a known case of pertussis. It is probable that pertussis is a more common cause of bronchitis than is currently realized. In children, treatment with erythromycin in the catarrhal stage, and sometimes in the paroxysmal stage, may be of benefit. 27 However, as adults do not have the usual whoop, it would be difficult to determine if they had pertussis unless there was contact with a known case. The author is unaware of studies of antibiotic use in adults with pertussis, but it might be reasonable to use erythromycin in adults if there is recent contact (within less than 2 weeks} with a person known to have pertussis.",

Usually the lung examination is normal, although rales and ronchi may be present in influenza, adenoviral, and C pneumoniae infections, and occasionally with M pneumoniae bronchitis. Wheezing may be present, as viruses and the three bacteria that cause bronchitis are the only known microbial pathogens (other than parasites) that may produce bronchospasm, although this is more common in children. 24,29-a3 With the exception of differences in incubation periods between the bacterial and viral causes of acute bronchitis, their symptoms are often nearly identical. Some distinguishing features that may be helpful in diagnosis are various rashes in mycoplasma infections, which occur in up to 25% of cases34; laryngitis, which was more common in C pneumoniae than mycoplasma or viral infections in one series3~; and laryngitis and pharyngitis, which often precede the cough by several days to a week in C pneumoniae infections. 2~ The presence of sinusitis or otitis is of no help as either may occur in viral, M pneumoniae, and C pneumoniae infections. 35,a6 Pulmonary infiltrates characteristic of the atypical pneumonia syndrome may be present in 3% to 10% of cases of M pneumoniae infections, a2,aa and about 10% of C pneumoniae infections, a5 The majority of pneumonia cases due to M pneumoniae occur in older children and young adults, while the bulk of C pneumoniae cases are found in the elderly. 21 Elevation of the white blood cell count occurs in 27% or less of acute bronchitis cases, re,a5 TREATMENT Many physicians use antibiotics to treat acute bronchitis in patients without underlying disease such as COPD. This practice is often deplored in journal articles and textbooks written by infectious disease specialists. 14,37-,39 As most cases of acute bronchitis are due to a viral infection, antimicrobial treatment should be ineffective in this group, save for influenza A, which responds to amantadine or rimantadine with a 33% to 50% shortening of the duration of the illness when given in the first 48 hours of the illness. 4\u00b0-42 Aerosolized ribavirin has been shown to have a modest beneficial effect in adults with bronchitis due to RSV. 43 In a study of 98 patients, tetra cycline therapy did not shorten the duration of cough in patients with M pneumoniae infections compared with nonrandomized control patients. 22 To date, nine clinical trials have compared the use of antimicrobial agents and placebo or albuterol in patients with acute bronchitis [ Table 1 ). Four of these trials used doxycycline as the antibiotic. 7,8,44,45 TWo of the studies had small numbers of patients. Both studies were randomized double-blind prospective trials. The smaller study had only 39 patients enrolled with 31 completing the study, and the larger study enrolled 74 patients with 69 completing the study. Neither study showed an advantage for doxycycline, but the larger trial showed an advantage for the placebo, although only fewer days missed from work was statistically significant. 7 The largest of the four studies enrolled 212 patients from three group practices in Wales, with 207 completing the trial. 44 This prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial used doxycycline 100 mg twice the first day and 100 mg per day for the next 9 days, with 104 patients receiving doxycycline and 103 receiving placebo. In this study there was also no difference between doxycycline and placebo.",

The smaller of the two studies (50 of 52 patients completed the study) used 7 days of treatment, and showed a nonsignificant trend favoring erythromycin among nonsmokers, but there was no difference between erythromycin and placebo among those who smoked. 4 The larger study enrolled 63 patients and used 10 days of erythromycin treatment; 6 patients did not return for follow-up, and 9 (7 of whom were given erythromycin) stopped their study drug because of gastrointestinal side effects or because they \"forgot\" or \"it didn't help.\" The authors analyzed the results with and without these 9 patients (i.e., 57 or 48 total patients). This study found a statistically significant advantage for erythromycin in terms of fewer symptoms between day 6 and day 10 of the study. However, on day 10 (the last day of the study), only reduction in \"congestion\" in the erythromycin group showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo. The authors found no difference between smokers and nonsmokers, or between the group of 57 versus the group containing 49 patients. 47 The eighth study compared liquid erythromycin ethylsuccinate 400 mg, with liquid albuterol 2 rag, every 6 hours for 7 days. This study was also prospective and double blind with the patients completing symptom diaries every day. Forty-five patients were enrolled, and 42 began the study. Two of 22 patients receiving erythromycin and 2 of the patients receiving albuterol withdrew because of medication side effects. Two more patients taking erythromycin and one patient taking albuterol failed to return for follow-up after 7 days of treatment, and one patient was dropped because of a cough lasting over 30 days {an exclusion criterion). Therefore, 34 patients completed this study with 17 in each group. Interestingly, 65% of the albuterol group were smokers versus 35% of the erythromycin group. After 7 days, only 41% of the albuterol group were still coughing compared with 88% of the reduced, but the difference was small, i.e., 99% of placebo group were still coughing at 7 days vs 93% of treatment group, and 74% of active drug group were back to work vs 60% in placebo group. Cough and sputum production resolved more rapidly in the erythromycin group, but differences were not statistically significant for nonsmokers.

There was no difference between smokers and nonsmokers (69% vs 50%, still coughing). By day 10, 38% of active drug patients had no cough vs 33% on placebo; 14% of active drug patients felt \"poor\" vs 30% of placebo patients.

Patients with pneumonia due to M pneumoniae, however, respond to either tetracycline or erythromycin.

In view of the minimal advantage for either trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole or erythromycin in only two of the seven studies comparing antibiotics with placebo, the finding in the two small studies showing an advantage for either oral or inhaled albuterol over erythromycin should be pursued, by replicating these studies with a larger number of patients. If used in clinical practice, inhaled albuterol would probably be a better way to deliver the drug. Relief of bronchospasm by albuterol is probably the mechanism for shortening the duration of the cough in acute bronchitis.",

Because of the long incubation time characteristic of the three bacteria that have been implicated in acute bronchitis, it is often possible to predict that the infecting microbe is one of these bacteria, all of which have in vitro sensitivity to erythromycin. For example, if there is an outbreak of bronchitis in a family or work situation in which the time between new cases is over a week, the chance is fairly high that the microbial cause is not viral, and erythromycin may be used (with or without albuterol}, even though no study has been done to demonstrate antibiotic effectiveness in acute bronchitis for either mycoplasma or chlamydia pneumoniae. The fact that pneumonia may be present in 3% to 20% of M pneumoniae infections 2\u00b0,3~ adds some support to this, as M pneumonia, in which both erythromycin and tetracycline have a modest effect, may masquerade as bronchitis unless an x-ray is obtained. Conversely, if the incubation period seems to be under a week, the likelihood that the microbial cause is viral seems overwhelming, and no antimicrobial drug should be used. Rather, use of albuterol may shorten the course of the bronchitis.",

Many physicians treat this condition with antibiotics in spite of exhortations from the infectious diseases community that antimicrobial treatment is unjustified for a condition that is usually viral in origin, and will only lead to an increase in bacterial resistance to the antibiotics used. In fact, seven of the nine studies comparing antibiotics to placebo showed either no statistical difference between groups or, in one study, an advantage for the placebo. One of two studies showed a slight advantage for erythromycin compared with placebo, and one study showed a slight advantage for trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole over placebo. Two small studies showed a statistical advantage for albuterol over erythromycin, presumably because of the effectiveness of albuterol in relieving bronchospasm. At present, inhaled albuterol may be the preferred treatment for acute bronchitis, although a larger study comparing albuterol versus erythromycin and a placebo needs to be done.",
