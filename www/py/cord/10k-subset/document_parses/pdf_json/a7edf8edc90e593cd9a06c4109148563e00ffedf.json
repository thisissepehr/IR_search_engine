            "text": "One of the greatest potential strengths and weaknesses of the population health approach as an integrative function is its breadth of definition and purpose. The all-encompassing notion of health at a population level, achieved through intersectoral action, is not only intuitively appealing but also invites many actors to engage to achieve its magnanimous goals. However, as the population health approach gains momentum and is adopted by different sectors, its broad definition has been criticized. 5, 8, 11 The lack of precision of meaning of the term may be a barrier to clear communication between actors and may create confusion in role definitions in working together to achieve health. 5, 8, 9 In reference to the widespread use of the population health approach, Kindig and Stoddart 9 pointed out, 'While this development might be seen as a useful movement in a new and positive direction, increased use without precision of meaning could threaten to render the term more confusing than helpful'. Indeed for population health, a common and well-articulated terminology is essential to strong health policy, particularly as actors hailing from multiform disciplines join together to improve health outcomes for all.",

            "text": "As the discourse in health has evolved over the last several decades, so too has the discourse on the population health approach. 12 From the biomedical model to social ecological models for health, 13 from lifestyle approaches to the social determinants of health, the population health approach points to many social systems that contribute to health, including perhaps, unsurprisingly, the healthcare system itself. However, despite Canada's historical contribution to the genesis of population health, the Canadian health system has been slow to adopt the approach through broad system redesign. 14, 15 While parts of the system such as Public Health have held the population health approach as a cornerstone ideology for many decades, 9, 12 the approach is just now gaining momentum within the formal healthcare system. Traditionally, healthcare leaders have struggled to move away from the narrow biomedical model, with crisis management and the immediacy of demand for healthcare services leaving little time and resources to incorporate the population health approach into planning and day-to-day management. [15] [16] [17] However, research suggests that this reality is changing. [17] [18] [19] In many Canadian provinces, shifts in health system reform have resulted in new strategies for public participation and community-based priority setting initiatives oriented towards health and healthy communities. 18, 20, 21 Recent research has identified critical revisions to many Strategic Vision/Mission statements for Canadian Regional/District Health Authorities who embrace integration and targeted goals for population health, and not just the patients who receive care. 17 Furthermore, a growing number of Canadian provinces have begun to employ population needs-based funding models designed to reorient health systems towards health at a population level, well beyond traditional narrow models of acute care. 22 Further evidence of this movement is also apparent in policies and programmes across the United States. In the last decade, Kindig and others, have begun to articulate health production functions and incentive frameworks such as pay-for-population health performance models designed to reinforce healthcare's shift towards broader health outcomes at the population level. 23, 24 A focus on Accountable Care Organizations in the United States, which encourages collaboration between health organizations, clinicians and other health providers to improve health outcomes and reduce cost, has increased dramatically as a result of the recently passed Affordable Care Act. 25 Finally, a growing number of health organizations in the United States and in Canada have taken up the Triple Aim Framework, a guiding framework that articulates a set of integrated goals in which health system costs and quality of care must be balanced against the needs of the population and improved health outcomes for all. [26] [27] [28] These tangible examples speak of a changing landscape in which actors in the healthcare system are becoming increasingly important contributors to the population health agenda rather than simply 'minor players in the health of populations'. 29 As more healthcare leaders embrace policies and frameworks that have a long pedigree in the population health approach, there is a growing need to clarify what is meant by the term 'itself' so that clear expectations around accountability, ownership and roles and responsibilities can be determined and incentive structures can be aligned accordingly. This work acknowledges that population health is a shared responsibility and embraces Kindig's 8 sentiment that population health terminology 'is not at the margin of the policy debate but at the very centre, often representing competing views and values'. Clarifying the way actors in healthcare conceptualize and operationalize the term -a population health approach -will serve to proliferate the approach in healthcare and provide an important foundation for communication, partnerships and future action. The purpose of this article was to examine the conceptual and operational definitions of a population health approach among senior health system leaders in Canada to determine a future foundation for common language and understanding.",

            "text": "Due to early stages of adoption of the population health approach among healthcare leaders in Canada, a lead-user approach 32 was used to systematically identify study subjects who understood the current healthcare context but had also overcome barriers to successfully integrate the population health approach into their day-to-day programming. These study subjects were not intended to represent the majority of healthcare leaders in Canada, but rather those at the leading edge of the adoption of the population health approach in healthcare. According to Von Hippel, 32 because they are forerunners in a given field, lead users have needs that are not yet commonplace and frequently devise or adapt solutions to serve their unique needs. By understanding the needs and solutions of innovators who are adopting a population health approach, it was anticipated that these strategies could be adapted by others in the healthcare system. 33, 34 Purposive sampling was undertaken to identify subjects for the study. Only senior-level leaders in health organizations with a sizeable and defined population, and who were perceived to have made an impact on the population's health, were selected for inclusion. In the Canadian context, health organizations are most often assigned a geographically defined or catchment population (e.g. Provincial Ministries of Health, Regional/District Health Authorities and Hospitals) and/or a status-defined population (e.g. a group of individuals with a common ethnic or employment statussuch as Canada's military covered by the Department of National Defense, or Canada's Aboriginal peoples covered by the First Nations Inuit Health Branch of the Federal Government). Leaders of these types of Canadian health organizations were the focus of this study. Members of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) Board and the Canadian Population Health Initiative (CPHI) Council, who were in a strong position to observe leading behaviours across Canada, assisted in the development of an initial list of potential interview subjects. Snowball sampling was used to identify further subjects throughout the interview process. Of the 29 senior leaders across Canada invited to be interviewed, 21 agreed to participate. There appeared to be no systematic differences between those leaders who agreed and declined to participate. Interviewees came from organizations such as Regional/District Health Authorities, National/Provincial/Territorial Ministries of Health, Teaching Hospitals and Primary Care Organizations with wide geographic representation from seven Canadian Provinces and one Territory. Senior level leaders held positions such as Deputy Minister of Health, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, Chief Medical Officer of Health, Executive Director and Chief of Staff. Urban, rural and remote perspectives were represented in the sample.",

Given the relatively small data set, data were manually coded rather than making use of coding software. Thematic analysis was conducted in three waves. 31, 35 First, members of the research team individually reviewed the transcribed data to establish preliminary coding based on patterned responses related to leader's understanding and definition of the population health approach. Second, a fullday meeting was convened for the research team to agree upon common conceptual and operational themes that were consistently identified in the coded data. Researcher judgement was applied to finely articulate each theme, and refinements were negotiated throughout the day to ensure inter-rater agreement among team members. The team identified convergent themes (those conceptual elements of the population health approach that were consistently cited across interviews) and divergent themes (definitional elements that were less frequently articulated but reflected a unique operational reality for at least some leaders of healthcare). 36, 37 Finally, convergent and divergent themes were validated at two pan-Canadian workshops held in Vancouver and Toronto in March 2013, with representatives from a broad range of health system actors.

Many pointed out that shifting this servicebased approach to a patient-centric approach was a critical first step in orienting health organization goals around a person as the central unit of care. Once the patient-centred approach was in place, then person-centred models could be applied in which the health organization could consider the health needs of 'persons' regardless of whether they were actual users or potential clients. Several interviewees pointed out that once the person-centric model was in place, leaders could more easily argue the need to transition from a focus on patient, to client, to person and to the population at large: For leaders taking a person-centric rather than a servicebased approach, it was much easier to think 'upstream' about the multitude of factors that might have led to the person's poor health in the first place, and eventually towards the conditions that affect health for the entire population. In one example, a northern Community Health Centre reoriented their services-centric primary care model to a person-centric model by investing in a mobile primary healthcare van to improve access to preventive care for patients in geographically remote areas. This solution, while focused at a person level, recognized the transportation challenges specific to this sub-population and found that its implementation significantly improved access to preventive primary care for vulnerable rural and remote seniors.",

On the world stage, the elucidation of well-defined terminology underpinning the population health approach is at the very centre of sound health policy, as population health is increasingly recognized in many countries as a shared responsibility among multiple sectors. [39] [40] [41] It has long been acknowledged that embedded within this terminology is an implicit set of values and beliefs that may vary depending upon the actor and their particular context. 5, 8 As more and more leaders within the formal healthcare system embrace the population health approach and become central actors in achieving its goals, there is a growing need to clarify the way in which leaders in the healthcare system conceptualize and operationalize the term. By articulating the perspectives of healthcare leaders on the population health approach, an important foundation can be established in which organizational goals, accountabilities, roles and responsibilities and appropriate system-level incentive structures can be aligned. 19, 39 Results of this study demonstrated that early adopting healthcare leaders had a conceptual understanding of the population health approach consistent with the Public Health Agency of Canada's current definition. 10 These themes include focusing on health and wellness/prevention rather than illness, taking a population rather than an individual orientation, understanding needs and solutions through community outreach, addressing equity/health disparities/health in vulnerable groups, addressing the social/ multiple determinants of health and embracing inter-sectoral action and partnerships. These core elements also aligned with older, more entrenched definitions by Kindig and Stoddart 9 -'The health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group' -and reflected sentiments from Young's 11 work -beginning with a shift in thinking towards a positive notion of health rather than just the absence of disease, and then embracing a move towards action aimed at strategies to improve health in both the mean and distribution of the population.",

This variability among leaders in operationalizing the population health approach was driven by context, based upon the unique needs of the population being served, the political priorities, the organizational strategic goals and the existing relationships with community groups. Consistent with the findings by Brown et al., 16 the population health approach was being optimized via flexible and context-dependent vertical integration efforts that aligned local-level priorities among multiple partners to achieve common goals.

            "text": "One of the most critical points of divergence in this study was the way that healthcare leaders articulated their understanding of the population health approach in stages of implementation -starting with addressing the health of the individual and then moving towards the health of the entire population. There was recognition that the overall goal of a population health approach was to improve health outcomes within and across the distribution of a population; however, many leaders believed that a population health approach could be meaningfully applied even at a person level. The shift away from service-based management to patientcentred to person-centred care was seen as a critical first step in moving towards improving health at the population level. Previous research has argued that 'person-centred medicine' represents a shift in conceptualizing the patient as a whole person whose health needs exist in a complex social and ecological space, and whose rights to health extend well beyond healthcare. 46 This model of healthcare and its relationship to the population health approach may represent one of the most poignant areas of divergence from other actors in the field of population health, some of whom may not agree that being person-centric is truly an embodiment of a population health approach. 18 Current debate about whether population-centred and person-centred approaches to healthcare are truly compatible is ongoing in many countries. 47, 48 Some have argued that orienting care models in favour of the population may create an insensitivity to individual needs, while others have argued that population and person-centred care are 'two sides of the same coin' and that a balance between the two must be achieved. 48 Matheson and Neuwelt 49 recently argued that 'the \"centre of care\" is a contested space', in which multiple factors in healthcare compete with the 'person' to become the true centre of care. Regardless of the debate here, by bringing the population health approach to a broader arsenal of healthcare leaders, an opportunity for shifting resources and reorienting services towards prevention at either a person or population level can have a twofold purpose: to drive improvements in population health outcomes and to reduce costs through lower healthcare demand.",

These elements were influenced by the roles and contextual realities faced by senior leaders in the healthcare system. Often, personal conviction to pursue the best health attainable of persons and/or populations as the 'right thing to do' was a key mechanism by which leaders enabled and sustained the population health approach within their health organizations. Consistent with previous research, many leaders made reference to infrastructural, political and cultural barriers to integrating a population health approach and a greater need for population health information to better manage and monitor population health. [16] [17] [18] System leaders made it clear that there is a strong need for further investment in knowledge sharing and networking opportunities to help address the unique realities faced among those in the healthcare system and to support inter-sectoral action.",

It is clear that there is a need for flexible policies, frameworks and incentive structures that align with organizational priorities and allow healthcare leaders to meet the needs of their respective populations. However, there remains a persistent need to acknowledge those members of the community who may require care but who are not currently accessing services, and to ensure that targeted programmes aimed at improving the health of a particular subgroup do not unintentionally increase health inequity overall. 50 To further these efforts, population health intervention research should be pursued more extensively to increase the evidence base for the population health approach at both person and population levels in healthcare and to evaluate targeted and universal programmes.",
