            "text": "Background Asthma exacerbations are closely associated with respiratory virus infections. However, the pathophysiological consequences of such infections in asthma are largely unclear. Objective To examine the effect of rhinovirus 16 (RV16) infection on airway hypersensitivity to histamine. and on interleukin-8 (IL-8) in nasal lavage. Methods Twenty-seven non-smoking atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects participated in a placebo-controlled, parallel study. A dose of 0.5-2.9 x 10\"^ TCID50 RV16 or placebo was nasally administered. Cold symptoms were recorded by questionnaire throughout the study. Histamine challenges were performed at entry, and on days 4 and 11 after inoculation. Nasal lavages were obtained at entry, and on days 2 and 9. The response to histamine was measured by PC20 (changes expressed as doubling doses: DD). IL-8 levels were obtained by ELISA, and were expressed inng/ml. Results RV infection was confirmed by culture of nasal lavage and/or by antibody titre rise in each of the RV 16-treated subjects. Among the 19 RV 16-treated subjects, eight developed severe cold symptoms. Baseline FEV, did not change significantly during the study in either treatment group (F -0.99). However, in the RVl 6-treated subjects there was a decrease in PC20 at day 4, which was most pronounced in those with a severe cold (mean change\u00b1SEM: -1.14\u00b10.28 DD, P = OXn). In addition. IL-8 levels increased in tbe RV16 group at days 2 and 9 (F<U.O{)I). The increase in nasal IL-8 at day 2 correlated significantly with the change in PC20 at day 4 (r= -0.48, P = 0.04). Conclusion We conclude that the severity of cold, as induced by experimental RV16 infection, is a determinant of the increase in airway hypersensitivity to histamine in patients with asthma. Our results suggest that this may be mediated by an infiammatory mechanism, involving the release of chemokines such as IL-8.",

The logarithm of PC20 was used in the analysis, and changes in PC20 were expressed in doubling doses (DD).

This rise is ass(x:iated with cold score, change in airway hyperresponsiveness. and numbers of neutrophils and lymphwytes in peripheral bltHxi after infection. These findings suggest that the severity of the cold is a major determinant of rhinovirus-indiiced airway hypenesponsiveness in asthma. Our results fit in with the hypeithesis that this is mediated through an inflammatory mechanism inviil\\ing locally produced chemokines. This is the first placebo-controlled study showing the development of airway hypersensitivity to histamine after experimental infection with wild type rhinovirus. The change in airway hypersensitivity in the asthmatic subjects with severe colds was about 1 doubling dose, which is similar to what is usually observed after allergen challenge |28|. Rhinovinis-induced hypersensitivity of such magnitude has also been demonstrated in patients with atopic rhinitis by Lemanske et ai |l()|. However, in the latter subjects the histamine hypersensitivity lasted up lo 4 weeks after infection, whereas in our study the effect was no longer significant at day 11. One could speculate that the prolonged effect in atopic rhinitis may have been due to the additional allergen challenges during that study.",

The increase in airway hypersensitivity, in the absence of a significant decrease in lung function, during the acute phase of infection might be explained by physiological phenomena such as airway wall swelling, potentiating the airway narrowing effect of smooth muscle shortening [33] . Such an explanation would be in keeping with the observations by Cheung et al. [15] , who showed that experimental RV16 infection leads to excessive airway narrowing in response to inhaled methacholine in subjects with asthma. Airway wall swelling in asthma is generally considered to be a consequence of inflammation [2] . Indeed, Fraenkel et al. [14] recently described the infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly lymphocytes and eosinophils into the bronchial mucosa in patients with asthma after experimental RVI6 infection. The presently observed correlation between the numbers of \u00a9 1997 Blackwell Science Lid, Clinical and Experimental Allergy. 11, 36-45 neutrophils and lymphocytes in peripheral blood after infeetion and the change in airway hypersensitivity indirectly supports an active role of these cells in the virus-induced airway inllammation.",

            "text": "We found a marked rise in lL-8 in nasal secretions after RVl6 infection. In general, this confirms the ability of rhinovirus to increase the release of a number of proinflammatory mediators and/or cytokines within the airways, such as kinins [16, 34] and interleukin-1 [35] in nasal secretions, and histamine in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid [36] . The present results obtained by experimental rhinovirus infection are in keeping with the preliminary data of Teran et al. [22] , who showed that levels of IL-8 in nasal secretions were elevated in nasal secretions during a naturally acquired cold in children with asthma. Our results extend these previous observations by showing an association between the increase in IL-8 in nasal washings and cold or asthma symptoms, as well as the degree of worsening of airway hyperrespon.sivene.ss. IL-8 is a CXC-chemokine, produced by tissue cells {epithelial ceils, fibroblast and endothelial cells), leucocytes, macrophages and mast cells [24, 37] and displays various activities, such as chemotactic activity for neutrophils, lymphocytes and basophils [38] . In addition, IL-8 may be involved in the recruitment of primed eosinophils, implicating its involvement in allergic inflammation |39]. Since rhinovirus in vitro induces the production of IL-8 in epithelium, fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 120,21,40], our findings support the hypothesis that the release of mediators, such as the chemokine IL-8, can drive the airway inflammation, and thereby the hypersensitivity to histamine after rhinovirus infection in allergic asthma.",
