The radioactive solute was prepared by adding the technetium-99m dose in 2 ml physiological saline into a commercial vial of DTPA (Amersham UK), and the binding of 99mTc to DTPA was about 95%, using paper chromatography. The nebuliser was connected to the wall oxygen supply and a flow rate of 10 L/min was used. Immediately following the radioaerosol inhalation in a lying position, a dynamic acquisition was started using an Elscint Apex 409A or ADAC Vertex gamma camera/ computer system with the patient supine and the gammacamera placed posteriorly over the lungs. Twenty frames at 1 minute per frame were acquired over the 20 minute period using a 64 x 64 spatial resolution. Subsequent reframing was done to produce a single reframed image and regions of interest (ROI'S) were drawn around each lung or parts of the lung. Time-activity curves were then obtained for each region/lung and an exponential fit was performed on the time-activity curves from peak to 7 minutes to obtain a clearance half-time (T'/) i.e. time for 50% of the radioaerosol to clear from the lung.

Xenon-133 lung scanning is not available in our part of the world, and is expensive for us to use routinely; hence our decision to use s9mTc DTPA aerosol. Both the radioaerosol and the Xenon lung scan have the limitation of false positives and false negatives in patients with pre-existing lung disease, and if they are smokers. Our patients were healthy young persons who had no proven lung disease previously, though some of them in the ammonia burns group may have been smokers. The damage caused by the ammonia was probably worse than the effects of smoking as proven by the bronchoscopy findings.

A previous study done at this hospital 1\u00b0 did not show any correlation between severity of bronchoscopic changes and PaO, or the severity of the skin burn. The false negative radioaerosol ventilation results are possibly due to this investigation being done one week after the bronchoscopy, while the false positives are either due to effect of smoking, or due to the delayed bronchoscopy being normal 5 days after the ventilation scan. It would appear that the retention images produced to obtain an index of regional lung ventilation and damage, are not useful in most cases.
