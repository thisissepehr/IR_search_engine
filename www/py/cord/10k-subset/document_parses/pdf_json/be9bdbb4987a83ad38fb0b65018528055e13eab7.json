Despite reports of its possible role in insulin exocytosis and cell proliferation, its function in beta cells remains controversial. We aimed to characterise the function of TMEM27 in islets and its potential use as a beta cell mass biomarker. Methods To determine TMEM27 function, we studied TMEM27 gene expression and localisation in human healthy and diabetic islets, the correlation of its expression with cell cycle and insulin secretion genes in human islets, its expression in tungstate-treated rats, and the effects of its overproduction on insulin secretion and proliferation in a beta cell line and islets. To elucidate its utility as a beta cell mass biomarker, we studied TMEM27 cleavage in a beta cell line, islets and primary proximal tubular cells. Results TMEM27 mRNA levels in islets are lower in diabetic donors than in controls. Its gene expression correlates with that of insulin and SNAPIN in human islets. TMEM27 expression is downregulated in islets of tungstate-treated rats, which exhibit decreased insulin secretion and increased proliferation. TMEM27 overproduction in a beta cell line and islets significantly enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion, with modest or no effects on proliferation. Finally, TMEM27 is cleaved and shed by renal proximal tubular cells and pancreatic islets.",

At the beginning of the disease, pancreatic beta cells adapt to insulin resistance by increasing their mass and secretory function. Nevertheless, the sustained hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia eventually exert a negative impact on beta cell function and lead to impaired insulin secretion and decreased insulin gene expression, ultimately causing beta cell apoptosis [1, 2] . Moreover, the follow-up of beta cell mass in diabetic patients and in people strongly at risk for diabetes and their response to pharmacological treatment may be crucial for early diagnosis and treatment selection, making the search for beta cell mass markers a high priority for investigation [3] .",

In this study, we characterised TMEM27 production in human pancreatic islets, confirming that it is mainly produced in beta cells. Importantly, we report that TMEM27 expression is decreased in type 2 diabetic islets. In addition, using gene expression analysis in human and rat islets along with gain-of-function experiments in a pancreatic beta cell line and isolated islets, we provide evidence that TMEM27 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion with little if any control of proliferation. Finally, we show that TMEM27 is cleaved not only by beta cells but also by kidney tubular cells, a finding that rules it out as a beta cell mass biomarker.",

In addition, TMEM27 positively correlated with SNAPIN (Fig. 2b) , which encodes a protein related to the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex with which TMEM27 has been shown to interact [7] . As expected, insulin correlated with SNAPIN ( ESM Fig. 5 ).

This treatment improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (ESM Fig. 2a-c) , lowers basal insulinaemia (Fig. 3a) and decreases glucosestimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 3b) . Pancreatic islets from tungstate-treated rats present a higher ratio of PCNApositive cells (Fig. 3c) , which is indicative of enhanced proliferation. Therefore, tungstate treatment elicits decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increases islet proliferation, making these animals an interesting model for the analysis of the potential implication of TMEM27 in these two cellular functions. In islets from tungstate-treated rats, we found that, despite the increase observed in beta cell proliferation, Tmem27 mRNA levels were decreased in parallel to those of insulin, with a significant correlation between Tmem27 and insulin gene expression (Fig. 3d-f ), as we observed previously in human islets.",

One possible explanation for this observation was that TMEM27 was produced in different endocrine subtypes within the islets. However, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that TMEM27 production was mainly localised to beta cells in all three species (ESM Fig. 7) . Next, to establish the importance of the primary sequence of TMEM27, we adenovirally expressed rat, mouse and human Tmem27/ TMEM27 cDNA in rat INS-1 cells (ESM Fig. 6b ). Here again, we found characteristic band patterns for each isoform, suggesting that the differences observed were more probably due to the amino acid sequence of TMEM27 than to the presence of specific modifying or processing enzymes.",

We therefore studied the effects of overexpressing rat, mouse and human Tmem27/TMEM27 on insulin secretion and proliferation in INS-1 cells. All three proteins elicited an increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and a slight increase in proliferation (Fig. 4b, c) , which was not accompanied by an increase in cell number (Fig. 4d) . So the different orthologues appeared to exert similar effects when overexpressed in the same cellular context. Finally, in order to rule out a possible artefact from the beta cell line, we tested the effect of overexpressed rat Tmem27 in isolated rat pancreatic islets and demonstrated, as in INS-1 cells, a significant enhancement in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with no changes in proliferation levels (Fig. 5) . Altogether, our data indicate that TMEM27, irrespective of the species of origin, is mainly involved in insulin secretion.",

Here we investigated the cleavage pattern of TMEM27 in beta cells and kidney tubular cells, with or without overproduction of rat TMEM27 (which harbours a C-terminal myc tag). For this purpose we used two different antibodies: (1) a myc tag antibody which recognises the complete protein and the C-terminal fragment that remains anchored to the membrane after cleavage; and (2) an antibody against the N-terminal of the protein [6] which recognises both the complete protein and the fragment that is released into the extracellular space after cleavage (Fig. 6a) . As shown in Fig. 6b, 16 h after adenoviral infection of INS-1 cells, overproduced myctagged TMEM27 was detected as two different molecular mass bands with anti-myc antibodies. An additional lower molecular mass band (\u223c20 kDa) appeared 4 h later, probably corresponding to the previously described fragment of TMEM27 [6] which remains anchored to the Fig. 5 TMEM27 overproduction in rat islets enhances glucoseinduced insulin secretion without affecting proliferation. a Insulin secretion at 2.2 or 16.7 mmol/l glucose of rat islets overproducing rat TMEM27 or \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) as control: n=7-9, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. b Cell proliferation measured as incorporation of [methyl-3 H]thymidine in counts per minute in islets overproducing rat TMEM27 or \u03b2-gal as control.

Time 0 refers to time of infection. Multiple bands corresponding to the TMEM27 protein are detected by immunoblot with the c-myc antibody (arrows). Beta-actin serves as a loading control. A non-specific band (arrowhead) is sometimes detected in INS-1 832/13 extracts. Molecular mass markers are shown on the left. c INS-1 832/13 cells, islets and primary proximal tubular cells were infected with the adenovirus encoding myc-tagged rat TMEM27. Total protein extracts from non-infected and infected cells were immunoblotted using the anti-c-myc antibody. Note that a lowmolecular-mass band (<25 kDa) is visible in INS-1 832/13, islets and proximal tubular cells. Lanes from untreated cells (negative controls) are included to validate specificity of the bands recognised. d Immunoblot of TMEM27 (using an antibody against the N-terminal of the protein) in supernatant fractions from primary proximal tubular and INS-1 832/13 cells not infected and infected with the adenovirus encoding rat TMEM27.

Though all these data might be interpreted as indicative of the existence of a link between Tmem27 expression and beta cell dysfunction, the truth is that the role of TMEM27 in the physiology of the pancreatic beta cell is still a matter of controversy. One study points towards its implication in insulin secretion as a component of the SNARE complex [7] , while another indicates that it is mainly involved in beta cell replication [6] . Furthermore, another recent study reports that Tmem27knockout mice do not display any prominent pancreatic phenotype [8] .",

In fact, we found a significant and positive correlation with insulin and SNAPIN but not with cyclins (E1 and D1), CDK2 or CDK6, which suggests that TMEM27 expression is more directly correlated to changes in insulin secretion than to beta cell proliferation. While interpretation of these data has obvious limitations, as these studies are restricted to the key regulators of the cell cycle [28] and we cannot rule out the existence of correlations at the level of protein expression, we reached a similar conclusion when we used an experimental rat model based on tungstate treatment [10, 25] . This model offers us the possibility to assess Tmem27 expression in a scenario of increased beta cell proliferation and diminished insulin secretion, which is substantially different from the models mentioned above, in which both secretory and proliferative activities were affected in a similar manner. In tungstatetreated rats, we found downregulation of islet Tmem27 expression. Thus, altogether, our expression data in humans and rats favour a role of TMEM27 in insulin secretion rather than cell proliferation.",

Because previous studies overexpressing either mouse Tmem27 [6] or human TMEM27 [7] in insulinoma cells and transgenic mice had reached different conclusions, we wondered whether different TMEM27 isoforms were responsible for the discrepancies. In fact, our preliminary observation that rat, mouse and human TMEM27 proteins showed different band patterns in immunoblot analysis, not only in protein extracts from isolated islets but also when overproduced in INS-1 cells, provided support for the hypothesis that inter-specific variations in the posttranslational modifications and/or processing of TMEM27 proteins might account for the reported differences in function. Nevertheless, our data show strikingly similar results when these three isoforms are overexpressed in INS-1 cells: a significant enhancement in glucose-induced insulin secretion with a very modest increase in proliferation, which was not reflected in measurable increases in cell number. Likewise, overproduction of the rat isoform in isolated rat islets resulted in modifications in insulin secretion but not in proliferation rates.",

For this reason, most studies are performed in cadaver donors, as the risks of pancreas biopsies outweigh the benefits of research. However, the monitoring of beta cell mass in association with insulin secretion could be extremely useful for describing and predicting the dynamics of beta cell loss and, very importantly, may improve the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus [29, 30] . TMEM27 was reported to be cleaved and shed (in a constitutive way) into the extracellular compartment only by pancreatic beta cells. Because of this reported beta cell specificity, Akpinar et al. [6] proposed that the quantification of this protein in serum might be used as an indirect measure of beta cell mass, and thus it would have a role as a beta cell biomarker.",
