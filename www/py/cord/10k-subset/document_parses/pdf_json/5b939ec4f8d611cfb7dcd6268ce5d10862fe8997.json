It shows enhanced Gram-negative activity bacteremia, and survival than imipenem, sulbactam, rifampin and relative to imipenem/cilastatin and often retains activity against tobramycin.

Furthermore, in contrast to therapy of A. baumannii pneumonia.

They offer of pulmonary infiltrates and quantitative culture of tracheal aspiexcellent activity against Gram-negative bacilli and improved rates. Singh et al. [159] used this score to discriminate all ICU Gram-positive activity (e.g. against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus) patients in whom VAP was considered unlikely (CPIS score \u22646) over ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, these agents may result in cost from those that were likely to have VAP (CPIS score >6). Patients savings especially in situations where, because of their potent with CPIS \u22646 were randomized to receive either ciprofloxacin for broad-spectrum activity and excellent bioavailability, they may be 3 days or standard care (antibacterials for 10-21 days). After 3 used orally in place of intravenous antibacterials. However, there days patients in the ciprofloxacin group were re-evaluated; all is only limited experience with levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in patients with CPIS >6 received further treatment for pneumonia, the treatment of HAP. In one large study (n = 438) with most but all patients with CPIS \u22646 at 3 days had antibacterial treatment patients on mechanical ventilation, levofloxacin monotherapy stopped. Antibacterials were continued beyond 3 days in 90% (38 proved equally efficacious as imipenem/cilastatin in both microbi-of 42) of the patients in the standard therapy group compared with ologic eradication rate and clinical success rate.

Furthermore, patients with severe disease experimental therapy group (p = 0.0001).

Another point of concern is raised by recent antimicrobial therapy in the experimental group.
