            "text": "The pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection was studied in miniature swine piglets. The animals were inoculated orally with 2 x 107 plaque-forming units of porcine rotavirus (OSU strain). During the height of diarrhea, intestinal function was investigated by in vivo perfusion of a 30-cm segment of proximal jejunum and a 30-cm segment of distal ileum. Absorption of Na + and water decreased and 3-O-methylglucose transport was markedly reduced, P < 0.01 compared to control animals. Mucosal lactase and sucrase levels were depressed in both the jejunum and ileum, P < 0.001. Na+,K+-ATPase activity was significantly depressed only in the ileum, P < 0.001. These changes were associated with a marked reduction in villous height, suggesting that the diarrhea could be an osmotic diarrhea due to nutrient (carbohydrate) malabsorption. Fresh stool samples were obtained and analyzed immediately for NA +, K +, osmolarity, glucose, and lactose; the osmotic gap was also determined. Stool osmolarity continually increased from 248 +-20 mosm/liter prior to inoculation to 348 +-20 mosm/liter at 75 +--1 hr postinoculation (P < 0.005); the majority of the fecal osmotic gap could be accounted for by the amount of lactose present in the stools. Stool sodium increased from 34 +-6 mM prior to inoculation to a maximum of 65 +-4 mM at 53 +-l hr postinoculation, P < 0.001. There was no significant change in potassium concentration. The present investigation suggests that rotavirus-induced diarrhea is due to virus destruction of enterocytes lining the intestinal villi, thus reducing the mucosal surface area and important digestive enzymes. This destruction leads to an osmotic diarrhea due to nutrient (primarily carbohydrate) malabsorption. A possible contributing role of unopposed secretion from the crypt cannot be excluded from this study.",

Although there have been few studies of intestinal function in rotavirus gastroenteritis, a number of detailed studies have evaluated gastroenteritis caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGE) of swine, a completely unrelated virus (a coronavirus) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . These studies on TGE merit comment as this has been the most extensively studied viral diarrhea. TGE is an extrememly virulent, and frequently lethal, infection of piglets associated with essentially complete destruction of the villous epithelium within 12 hr after inoculation (18, 19) . Reduced mucosal Na+,K+-ATPase activity and defective glucose-stimulated Na + transport have been demonstrated. TGE-induced diarrhea has been reported in the absence of mucosal damage (13, 15) , although this has not been confirmed, and most studies have shown that the functional disturbances occur only after enterocyte destruction and shedding of virus into the lumen. The clinical severity of the disease is influence by the age of the host.",

The mini-swine piglet was chosen as the animal model because of similarities between human and porcine digestive physiology and because its small size makes it a convenient laboratory animal.

The small bowel was quickly removed, placed on ice, and the perfused segments removed. The length of each segment was measured; the wet weight was determined to the nearest 0.1 rag, and the dry weight was determined after drying to constant weight under an infrared heat lamp for 24 hr. Segments of bowel (4-6 cm) immediately distal to the jejunal perfusion site, immediately proximal to the ileal perfusion site, and in the mid-small intestine were removed for enzyme determinations and histology. Mucosal homogenates were prepared by opening the bowel along the mesenteric border and scraping the mucosa using a glass slide. The mucosa was homogenized (Soyrail Omni-Mixer) in 20-30 ml ice-cold 150 mM NaC1, pH 7.2, and the samples frozen (-22 ~ C).",

(2) the infection is lyric and causes the destruction of the enterocytes, resulting in a reduction of mucosal surface area and important digestive enzymes (thus the diarrhea follows the infection and appears when progeny virus is seen in the stools), (3) an osmotic diarrhea results from nutrient (primary carbohydrate) malabsorption, and (4) the mucosa is initially repopulated with immature cuboidal epithelial cells (with reduced absorptive function) followed by the regeneration of a normal villous architecture, Net secretion would result from reduced absorption, increased secretion, or both, This study cannot distinguish between these possibilities. If crypt secretion contributes to rotavirus-induced d!arrhea, the mechanism is unlikely to be mediated by adenlylate cyclase as normal theophylline stimulation of chloride secretion occurs, and similar cyclic AMP levels are present in isolated enterocytes from rotavirus-infected and control piglets (21) . In the other well-studied viral enteritis, TGE, diarrhea in infected piglets can be started and stopped by giving or withholding milk (19) suggesting that normal yet unopposed, crypt secretion may exert only a minor contribution to viral-induced diarrhea associated with destruction of small intestinal enterocytes.",

This is an important adaptNe phenomenon which was apparently lacking during the acute phase of rotaviral diarrhea in piglets, as the osmotic gap could be accounted for by mono-and disaccharides.

In those children, continuous administration of disaccharides was required before adapta: tion occurred, and adaptation was manifested by a reduction in the amount of malabsorbed lactose, associated with increasing amounts of lactate in the stools, and reduction in the severity of diarrhea (27, 28) . Thus, nutrient salvage by the colon is not immediate but requires the presence of carbohydrate for a definite time. It is currently unknown whether the colon has a roie in viral gastroenteritis, and this deserves furthei-study. Infants and small children with rotavirus gastroenteritis usUally come to the attention of physicians because of severe dehydrating gastroenteritis. The initial clinical description of rotavirus gastroenteritis in children reported that excess fecal sugar was not detected and assumed that the diarrhea is not caused by malabsorption (29) . Carbohydrate maiabsorption has subsequently been reported in a number of clinical studies including those evaluating rehydration solutions in children with rotaviral diarrhea (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) , and it is now consldered the rule. In studies comparing glucose-and sucrose-containing rehydration solutions (38) , a large osmotic gap was present (86 mosm/liter) but not commented on by the authors. We have examined the fecal water from one of our own children with rotavirus-induced diarrhea and the osmotic gas was 290 mosm/ liter (unpublished observation). Malabsorption of xylose, fat, and nitrogen have also been reported during the acute phase of rotaviral diarrhea, and recovery of absorptive function has been slow (42, 43) .",

In cholera and enterotoxigenic E. coli-induced diarrheas, the Figure 4A illustrates the time course of changes in stool sodium, potassium, and osmolality after rotavirus inoculation. Figtlre 4B illustrates that the majority of the fecal osmotic gap could be accounted for by the lactose present in the stools.",

Since viral gastroenteritis has a mark-edly different pathogenesis, possibly a different therapy should be considered (40) . A solution containing glucose in excess of that amount able to be absorbed, such as the WHO rehydration solution designed primarily for the treatment of cholera patients, may not be the best choice for rotavirusinduced gastroenteritis. The WHO solution has been shown to be effective when administered to hospitalized children, but the failure rate has been in the range of 10% (39, 45) . A nutrient-dense solution containing a mixture of absorbable nutrients, each employing different absorptive pathways, might be preferable to the current WHO solution but would require intensive testing before adoption. A solution containing a mixture of nutrients has been used in secretory diarrhea, ie, a glucose-glycine mixtUre has been shown to be more effective than a glucose solution in the treatment of cholera (46) and was also shown to be effective in the treatment of rotavirus-induced diarrhea in piglets (47) .",
