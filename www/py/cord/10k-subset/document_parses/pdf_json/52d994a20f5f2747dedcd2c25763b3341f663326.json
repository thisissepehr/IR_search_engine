Public health authorities are hesitant in introducing social distancing interventions due to societal disruption and productivity losses. This study estimates the effectiveness and total cost (from a societal perspective, with a lifespan time horizon) of a comprehensive range of social distancing and antiviral drug strategies, under a range of pandemic severity categories. Methods: An economic analysis was conducted using a simulation model of a community of~30,000 in Australia.

For severe pandemics of category 3 (CFR 0.75%) and greater, a strategy combining antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, extended school closure and community contact reduction resulted in the lowest total cost of any strategy, costing $1,584 per person at category 5. This strategy was highly effective, reducing the attack rate to 5%. With low severity pandemics costs are dominated by productivity losses due to illness and social distancing interventions, whereas higher severity pandemic costs are dominated by healthcare costs and costs arising from productivity losses due to death.

For high severity pandemics the inclusion of productivity loss following death, as presented in this study, leads to a markedly different assessment of total costs when compared to the two studies quoted above that considered severe pandemics [45, 46] .

Similarly Sander et al. found that the addition of continuous school closure to an extended antiviral strategy also increased total costs, including pandemics with a 5% CFR.
