The WHO is the directing and coordinating authority on international health work: in emergencies, including outbreaks of infectious disease, the WHO provides appropriate technical assistance if requested to do so by governments. The WHO's responsibilities in these situations are mandated primarily by the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) [3] , and this was tested to the utmost during the 2009 pandemic. The response by the WHO to the 2009 pandemic, as well as the preceding preparedness activities, has been scrutinized extensively during the external review of the IHR [4] . The committee concluded that the IHR helped make the world better prepared to cope with public health emergencies, but that the world is ill prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening public health emergency. The WHO was considered to have performed well in many ways, but demonstrated shortcomings in responding to a global public health emergency of protracted duration. The committee found no evidence of malfeasance on the part of the WHO, refuting allegations that WHO recommendations regarding the use of pandemic vaccines were influenced by the pharmaceutical industry.",

The aims of the IRP are to: F Strengthen surveillance for mild and severe disease caused by influenza across the region and share data to in-form global influenza vaccine strain selection F Use surveillance data to estimate the burden of influenza to prioritize national influenza vaccination and treatment programs F Support pandemic preparedness activities at the national level and the implementation of core capacities required under the IHR F Support the response of MS to outbreaks caused by influenza or other respiratory pathogens Implementation through coordination and collaboration WHO/Europe conducts its work jointly with its country offices and with WHO headquarters. Activities are conducted at the regional level involving all 53 MS, at the subregional level involving countries of the SEEHN or NIS, or with individual countries. These activities include meetings to present new WHO guidance and discuss their implementation, discuss new developments, and exchange good practice and training. MS participants are either formally nominated by the Ministries of Health (MoH) to represent their country or invited in their own right as experts, depending on the activity. In addition, WHO/Europe develops operational guidance (e.g., for the implementation of influenza surveillance and standards for laboratories), and through weekly bulletins and reports it collects, analyzes, and disseminates influenza surveillance data and data related to influenza vaccine policies and uptake that are reported by all 53 the MS. All key documents related to influenza are published in English and Rus- Work with countries is conducted in collaboration with the MoH based on a biennial cooperative agreement (BCA) that covers policy and technical support, including knowledge transfer, assessments, and evaluations. Country offices play a crucial role in the implementation of the BCA through liaison with the MoH as well as other organizations that are supporting programs in the area of health. Depending on the country needs, country offices have national and sometimes international staff. Country work in the area of influenza focuses on countries of the NIS and SEEHN.",

It did this through conducting a combination of regional and subregional meetings and trainings, establishing a regional network for influenza surveillance, providing operational guidance for implementing influenza surveillance and strengthening the capacities of National Influenza Centers, and through assistance at the country-level where needed. In all, close to 60 country-missions or country-level activities were conducted.

WHO conducts missions to countries to perform a joint risk assess-ment and assist with the investigation and response to an outbreak if formally requested to do so by the MoH. Such requests are channeled through the country offices, who lead the mission supported by WHO/Europe staff.

Mission teams are multidisciplinary, comprising experts chosen according to the type of outbreak, in infection control and clinical management, epidemiology, laboratory, human and animal public health, communications, social mobilization, and logistics. Their mode of operation is reflected in the mis-sions to Turkey and Azerbaijan in 2006, described below. WHO/Europe, with international partners, supported the governments of Azerbaijan and Turkey in responding to the outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 in 2006. These followed the first outbreaks of H5N1 in the WHO European region that occurred in poultry in the summer of 2005 in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. They were to be followed by multiple outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in a total of 28 WHO European region MS that occurred mainly between 2005 and 2008, after which outbreaks became sporadic as countries controlled the outbreaks among the animal population. The last outbreak in poultry in a WHO/Europe MS was reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in March 2012 [11] .",

In Mexico, unusual levels of influenza-like illness had been detected in mid-March 2009, and by mid-April atypical cases and clusters of severe pneumonia occurring mainly among previously healthy young adults in different areas of Mexico were observed. On 23 April, samples from Mexico were found to contain genetically identical viruses to the influenza H1N1 viruses from California and this information was immediately reported by the MoH to the WHO [32] . On 25 April, nearly 2 years after the IHR came into force, the 2009 (H1N1) pandemic was the first event to be declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the Director-Gen- eral of WHO, after consultation with an Emergency Committee and in accordance with IHR provisions. These events signaled the emergence of the 2009 pandemic. WHO continued to alert countries to the situation by the declaration of phases describing the global spread of the virus [33] . Phase 6 is the pandemic phase, declared when it is considered inevitable that the new virus has the potential to cause epidemics in every country. Summarized in . Tab. 3 is a timeline showing the declaration by the WHO of the phases and the main recommendations provided by the WHO (a full timeline of events has been published by the WHO [34]).

For the first time in history, countries implemented a pandemic response that drew on pandemic plans and activities undertaken in the few preceding years, and for the first time in history a pandemic vaccine was available during the first wave of the pandemic. By January 2010, most countries in the WHO European region had experienced an epidemic caused by the new virus and countries and international organizations alike started to evaluate their response to the pandemic and to take the necessary steps in the transition to seasonal influenza.

F Global phases describing the spread of the pandemic virus were not useful as triggers for response measures at the national level and local level. F A rapid assessment of severity and impact was hampered by a lack of standardized protocols and indicators, by a lack of routine surveillance for severe disease associated with influenza, and by tenuous links between public health authorities and health service providers. F The deployment of, and risk communication activities related to, pandemic vaccine were considered extremely difficult, with generally low uptake in risk groups, some countries having a surplus of vaccine and others receiving vaccine only after the epidemic, particularly those countries that received donations through the WHO.

The goal was to provide recommendations for pandemic plan revisions and to identify areas of planning that require further strengthening. Using a systematic approach, more than 200 individuals representing national, regional, and local responders in seven MS were interviewed. In addition to the lessons learned summarized above, the evaluation revealed six major themes essential for effective pandemic preparedness: communication; coordination; capacity; adaptability/flexibility; leadership; and mutual support. With respect to the theme of sup-port, the WHO pandemic planning guidance and the guidelines produced during the pandemic were considered extremely important. With respect to capacity, preparedness activities including training, inter-country exchange of expertise and experience, assessments and strengthening in specific fields such as surveillance and risk communication had a positive impact on the ability of MS to respond to the pandemic [10, 37].",

            "text": "Based on the experience of the past 7 years and feedback from MS, it can be concluded that the activities conducted by WHO/Europe in the area of influenza and pandemic preparedness have been useful and have filled a number of gaps. The level of pandemic preparedness and the capacity for influenza surveillance in the region, both epidemiological and virological along with early warning, has increased. These capacities will benefit public health in a broader context, as influenza surveillance can detect other respiratory infections; the capacities built as part of pandemic preparedness will support preparedness for other infectious diseases as well as the implementation of IHR core capacities. WHO/Europe was well positioned to guide and assist its country offices in the implementation of activities, and has coordinated activities with WHO headquarters as well as regional and global partners. This is commensurate with the goals of the WHO Reform [38] regarding health security, whereby the WHO will provide surveillance, alert-verificationassessment support, and event management mechanisms, along with direct operational support on the ground when needed, as well as assist countries to build their institutional capacities. However, a number of gaps were also identified, and to address these in times of shrinking resources, in 2011 the IRP program performed a situation analysis and developed a 5-year strategy. Based on this strategy, WHO/Europe will continue to assist MS efforts to strengthen surveillance for severe disease due to influenza and it will focus more on assist-ing countries to determine the burden of disease and risk factors for severe disease so as to inform seasonal influenza vaccination programs. Therefore, in collaboration with the VENICE project and ECDC [39] , in 2011 the first regional survey of seasonal influenza vaccine policies and uptake in the 53 MS was conducted. Currently, only one country in the region meets the 2005 WHO target of 75% vaccine uptake in the elderly, and few countries have programs to vaccinate other risk groups, such as persons with underlying conditions and pregnant women, or systems in place to monitor uptake (unpublished data). WHO/Europe will continue to conduct regular surveys to target assistance to countries in this area. WHO/Europe will continue to assist national influenza laboratories in the ten countries that currently are not recognized by WHO to obtain WHO recognition, to measure the impact of seasonal influenza in the region, as was done for the pandemic [31] , and to respond to requests for assistance in periods of unusual influenza activity. In 2011, during the first post-pandemic season that was dominated by the pandemic (H1N1) virus and which caused strains on critical care services in a number of countries, WHO/Europe together with the EC and ECDC organized regional teleconferences for clinicians from the first affected countries to share their experience in the management of severe cases with clinicians from countries that had not yet been affected [40]. WHO/Europe will continue to support MS efforts to revise their pandemic plans, through inter-country workshops jointly with ECDC similar to those organized in 2011 [41], through sharing of good practice, and through assistance to individual countries. This work will be integrated with efforts to enhance general preparedness for public health emergencies as well as the implementation of IHR core capacities. WHO/Europe together with MS experts and ECDC is currently revising the European pandemic indicators [27] that will form a new European guidance for pandemic preparedness. WHO/ Europe, as WHO secretariat, will support the implementation of the PIP Framework [9] .",
