Activated Rac serves various cellular functions including the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in lymphocytes and neutrophils and production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils. Since 2015, six unrelated patients with combined immunodeficiency and early-onset severe viral infections caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in DOCK2 have been described. Until now, the function of phagocytes, specifically neutrophils, has not been assessed in human DOCK2 deficiency. Here, we describe a new kindred with four affected siblings harboring a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.2704-2 A > C) in DOCK2. The mutation results in alternative splicing and a complete loss of DOCK2 protein expression. The patients presented with leaky severe combined immunodeficiency or Omenn syndrome. The novel mutation affects EBV-B cell migration and results in NK cell dysfunction similar to previous observations. Moreover, both cytoskeletal rearrangement and reactive oxygen species production are partially impaired in DOCK2-deficient neutrophils.",

            "text": "Dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a major guaninenucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) for GTPase-activating proteins, and is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells [1, 2] . It binds and activates Rac through its DOCK homology region domain (DHR) [2] . Activated Rac serves multiple functions downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and antigen and complement receptors, including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Numerous GEFs can activate Rac and their relative importance depends on the cell type, the ligand, and the downstream effector function in mice and humans [9] . In 2015, Dobbs et al. described five unrelated patients with early-onset invasive viral and bacterial infections caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in DOCK2 [10] . Recently, Alizadeh et al. reported a sixth patient with the same phenotype [11] . The different mutations resulted in absent or markedly reduced levels of DOCK2 protein expression or in expression of a truncated protein lacking the DHR2 domain. Several immunological abnormalities have been documented in DOCK2-deficient patients. These include na\u00efve T cell lymphopenia with reduced T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and diminished T cell proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin, variable reduction of B cell numbers, with defective antibody responses despite normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels, and impaired NK cell function. Total polymerized filamentous actin (F-actin) was diminished in T-, B-, and NK lymphocytes, and T-and B cell chemotaxis was also impaired by DOCK2 deficiency [10] . Interferon (IFN)-alpha and -lambda production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from DOCK2-deficient patients was reduced after ex vivo exposure to herpes simplex virus 1 or vesicular stomatitis virus [10] . Moreover, DOCK2deficient simian virus 40 fibroblasts showed increased viral replication and enhanced virus-induced cell death after exposure to encephalomyocarditis virus. Three of the six published patients succumbed to infection (Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis, viral pneumonitis, and persistent CMV infection); the other three were successfully treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Thus, autosomal recessive (AR) DOCK2 deficiency results in a combined immunodeficiency (CID) with additionally impaired innate and cell-intrinsic immunity [10] . Overall, the phenotype of human AR DOCK2 deficiency is reminiscent of observations in Dock2 \u2212/\u2212 mice [7, [12] [13] [14] .",

The neutrophil chemotaxis and ROS production defects are more pronounced in Dock2/ Dock5 double knockout mice [16] . Pre-treatment of human neutrophils with CPYPP, a small molecule inhibitor of the DHR-2 domain of DOCK proteins and thus of the Rac GEF activity of human DOCK2 and DOCK5, also significantly impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and ROS production [16] . However, to date, no data have been reported on phagocytic cell function in human primary AR DOCK2-deficient neutrophils.

[17] ) was determined using the Multiscreen chemotaxis system as previously described [18] . The Multiscreen plate (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) is a disposable device with a 96well filter plate (5 \u03bcm pore size) and a 96-well receiver plate. Cell migration occurs through the 96-well filter plate in response to a chemotactic gradient. EBV-B cells suspensions (100 \u03bcL in 96-well filter plate at a concentration of 3.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL) and test samples (150 \u03bcL in 96-well receiver plate) were diluted in RPMI medium without phenol red and L-glutamine (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 0.1% BSA (endotoxin free; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). After 4 h migration at 37\u00b0C, the upper 96-well filter plate was removed and the cells in the lower receiver plate were quantified using t h e l u m i n e s c e n c e AT P d e t e c t i o n a s s a y sy st e m (PerkinElmer Life).

Both conditions were supplemented with anti-CD107a-PE (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium).

After 5 min of stimulation, neutrophils were fixed with 100 \u03bcL of 4% formaldehyde and two independent observers evaluated each condition in a blinded manner. One hundred cells were counted microscopically (magnification \u00d7 200) and divided into round cells, cells with protrusions, and elongated cells as described previously [19] . Finally, the average percentage of non-shape changed perfectly round cells, and cells showing membrane protrusions and an irregular cell shape, were calculated [20] .",

We identified a homozygous variant in DOCK2 (5:169267759; c.2704-2 A > C) located at an evolutionarily conserved nucleotide at the acceptor splice site of intron 26 as shown by multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1c) and a combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD, 23.8) was higher than the mutation significance cutoff (MSC; 3.313 for DOCK2). The effect of the identified variant was predicted to disrupt the acceptor site (position \u2212 2) of the start of exon 27 (Human Splice Finder and NNSPLICE 0.9) [27, 28] . The identified variant allele was not found in publicly available databases (dbSNP, ExAC, and gnomAD as assessed in June 2018) or in the Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases Lab in-house database of 4500 WES from patients with severe infections. Furthermore, the variant identified in this kindred was distinct from those detected in the six patients with AR DOCK2 deficiency described to date (Fig. 1d , e, [10, 11] ). The variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the clinical and immunological phenotype in the kindred (Fig. 1a) .

Skipping of exon 27 (33%) or retention of 46 nucleotides of intron 26 (67%) was the alternative splicing products of DOCK2 characterized by PCR cloning in PBMCs of patient II.6 (data not shown). These alternative splice products were present together with the wild-type transcript in I.1 (heterozygous carrier). Immunoblot analysis showed that the splicing defects lead to a complete loss of expression of DOCK2 in EBV-B cells derived from patient II.6 (Fig. 2b) . Consistent with this loss of expression, patient II.6 EBV-B cells (II.6) showed a lack of migration to the chemokines CCL20 or CXCL12 compared to EBV-B cells generated from healthy controls (HC, n = 2) (Fig. 2c) . Expression of CCR6 and CXCR4, receptors for CCL20 and CXCL12 respectively, on EBV-B cells from patient II.6 was comparable to control EBV-B cells (data not shown, [29] ). This indicates that impaired migration does not result from low or absent expression of the chemokine receptors. Furthermore, in line with previous observations [10] , we observed aberrant degranulation of DOCK2-deficient NK cells (II.6) upon stimulation with K562 target cells (Fig. 2d, e) compared to NK cells from a healthy control, a healthy wild-type brother (II.1), and a heterozygous DOCK2 mutation carrier (I.1).",

            "text": "We report a kindred with AR DOCK2 deficiency caused by a novel homozygous splice-site mutation leading to complete loss of expression of DOCK2 protein. Early-onset severe viral infections, T cell lymphopenia, and functional defects of T-, B-and NK cells are the predominant immunophenotype of DOCK2 deficiency (Table S1 ) [10, 11] . TRECs were absent in two of the patients reported by Dobbs et al. [10] and in index patient II.6. The DOCK2-deficient patients reported here all fulfill the diagnostic criteria of leaky SCID or Omenn syndrome. Thymic shadow was present on chest X-ray, whereas T cell lymphopenia in T \u2212 B +/\u2212 NK + SCID conditions is usually associated with a small or undetectable thymus [31] . Two other (S)CID conditions with detectable thymus, Coronin-1A deficiency [22, 23, 25] , and CD3\u03b4 deficiency [24] have been reported. Deficient emigration of mature thymocytes in response to CCL19 has been reported in organ cultures of Dock2 \u2212/\u2212 -deficient mice [7] . We hypothesize that the na\u00efve T cell lymphopenia in the presence of a thymus in DOCK2deficient patients results at least in part from the impaired release of mature T cells from the thymus due to dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton. DOCK2 deficiency should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of SCID and of Omenn syndrome. Among the five patients included in the first report of human DOCK2 deficiency, one died of Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis at 20 months of age [10] . The authors suggested that DOCK2 deficiency may also affect phagocytic cell function. Dock2 \u2212/\u2212 mice are uniquely susceptible to Citrobacter rodentium infection, with impaired recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the infected organs, leading to death in a significant proportion of mice [32] . In one of the patients reported here, the extensive perianal dermatitis may allude to a potential phagocyte dysfunction. The nephrotic syndrome and the massive pulmonary inflammation with hemorrhage and ARDS upon engraftment were also particular, though a clear link with neutrophil dysfunction prior to HSCT is Nevertheless, the present study shows that human DOCK2 deficiency leads to impaired F-actin polymerization and shape change in neutrophils in response to chemoattractants. These processes are essential for neutrophil chemotaxis and migration. Due to sampling limitations, we were unable to perform in vitro chemotaxis assays with neutrophils, but it is likely that these would also be impaired. Indeed, similar results have been reported in Dock2 \u2212 / \u2212 mice and in human neutrophils treated with the DOCK2/5 inhibitor CPYPP [16] . Next, we show an impaired respiratory burst activity in neutrophils from patient II.6, as measured by cytochrome c reduction after PMA stimulation. Reduced O 2 \u2212 production was also found in the patient's EBV-B cells. On the other hand, the DHR assay in DOCK2-deficient neutrophils and monocytes from patient II.6 was normal in response to PMA (Fig. 4b, Fig. S1 ). It is important to realize that the DHR assay is a screening assay of respiratory burst activity and not an absolute measurement of hydrogen peroxide production, even more so when using only PMA as a stimulus [33] . The patient was off steroids at the time of sampling. Moreover, the decreased cytochrome c reduction in EBV-B cells suggests that the defect in respiratory burst activity in the patient's neutrophils is a not a secondary event. The description of NADPH oxidase in EBV-B cells and monocytes next to neutrophils is relevant as there may be differential expressivity of a phenotype depending on the cell type studied. Rac-GTP is part of the assembled NADPH oxidase complex, which acts as a molecular switch to activate Fig. 4 The respiratory burst is impaired in DOCK2-deficient neutrophils and EBV-B cells. Panel a presents the quantification of superoxide production by neutrophils after stimulation with PMA in cytochrome c reduction assay. Analysis was run in duplicate for a healthy control (HC, black) and for II.6 (red), indicated as traces HC1, HC2, and II.6.1 and II.6.2 accordingly. Panel b shows the DHR oxidation after PMA stimulation in neutrophils from healthy control (HC), patient II.6, and healthy sibling II.1 measured via flow cytometry. White peaks are unstimulated cells and gray peaks are stimulated cells. Panel c pictures the superoxide production measured by Luminol assay in EBV-B cells after PMA stimulation from healthy control (HC), patient II.6, and from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD, negative control). One representative experiment out of two is shown. Panel d presents the H 2 O 2 release after PMA stimulation in EBV-B cells from a healthy control (HC), patient II.6, and from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD, negative control) using the Amplex Red assay. One representative experiment out of two is pictured one of the oxidase subunits, p67phox (NCF2) [34, 35] . Thus, impaired activation of Rac in absence of DOCK2 leads to reduced NADPH oxidase activity by affecting the catalytic activity of the enzyme. We can also presume that due to incomplete activation of Rac and perhaps other small GTPases, the cytoskeleton rearrangement may differ in DOCK2-deficient neutrophils and EBV-B cells as compared to control cells, leading to impaired accumulation of active NADPH oxidase complexes at the cell surfaces and giving rise to the observed impaired respiratory burst at least in vitro. How/if the cytoskeleton regulates enzyme assembly is less well understood. Another possible explanation is the site of O 2 \u2212 detection. DHR is oxidized intracellularly, whereas all other assays used for this project detect oxidase activity extracellularly [30] . Altogether, these data support a role for DOCK2 and the DOCK2-Rac axis and the actin cytoskeleton in the O 2 \u2212 forming respiratory burst activity following stimulation of GPCRs. Unfortunately, we were not able to study the respiratory burst activity in response to other stimuli due to the patient's critical clinical situation and start of conditioning regimen. Indeed, NADPH oxidase activity in response to complement opsonized bacteria may well be normal as these stimuli are expected to activate VAV family and other GEFs via non-G protein-coupled receptors [4, 9] . The clinical phenotype in DOCK2 deficiency is far less suggestive of neutrophil dysfunction than the phenotype of patients with dominant negative mutations in RAC2, who present with omphalitis and soft tissue abscesses, probably due to the dominant negative RAC2 protein affecting also the GTPase activity of the ubiquitously expressed RAC1 [34] [35] [36] [37] . Interestingly, the neutrophil dysfunction phenotype was also modest in two patients with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in RAC2 [38] . Nevertheless, it is prudent to take the at least partially impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and respiratory burst activity into account in DOCK2-deficient patients. Finally, the finding of neutrophil dysfunction in human DOCK2 deficiency confirms the impact of deleterious mutations in genes related to the actin cytoskeleton on the normal function of human myeloid and lymphoid immune cells [8, [34] [35] [36] [37] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] .",

Panel a presents the normalized filamentous actin polymerization (F-actin) in unstimulated neutrophils (white bar) or 10 \u22128 M fMLF (gray bar) for 3 min followed by fixation. Microscopic pictures were analyzed for mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of intracellular F-actin. Panel b shows the neutrophil shape changes after stimulation (fMLF (10 \u22127 M) or CXCL8 (25 ng/ mL)) compared to unstimulated cells. After 5 min, neutrophils were fixed and changes in cell shape were evaluated microscopically. Two hundred cells/condition were counted.

After centrifugation and another two washing steps, the neutrophils were suspended in PBS and counted in a hemocytometer (> 95% neutrophils). Alternatively (patient II.5), granulocytes were isolated using the EasySep\u2122 Direct Human Neutrophil Isolation Kit (StemCell Technologies, Grenoble, France). Both neutrophil isolation steps correlated perfectly in terms of neutrophil analysis afterwards (data not shown) and the choice for either method was based upon the number of samples to handle.Neutrophil Actin Polymerization Assay Neutrophils (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL, 200 \u03bcL/well) were adhered on a poly-L-lysine (100 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma)-coated 8-well EZ slide chamber (Millipore) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After adherence, the cells were carefully washed with warm RPMI medium (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 2 mM HEPES (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 0.5% human serum albumin (Belgium Red Cross) and incubated with medium only or 10 \u22128 M fMLF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 3 min. The reaction mixture was removed and cells were immediately fixed for 15 min at room temperature (RT) in 2% paraformaldehyde (200 \u03bcL/well). Following fixation, the cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 0.01% Tween-20 (200 \u03bcL/well). Next, cells were permeabilized for 5 min at RT in 0.25% Triton X-100/PBS, washed again and blocked (3% BSA + 5% normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in PBS) for 20 min at RT. Cells were then immediately stained for 30 min at RT in the dark with rhodamine-phalloidin (0.17 \u03bcM; ThermoFisher Scientific) and Hoechst (5 \u03bcg/mL). Following staining, cells were washed twice with wash buffer, air-dried, and covers l i p p e d w i t h P r o L o n g G o l d A n t i f a d e R e a g e n t (ThermoFisher Scientific). Microscopic analysis was performed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200 M, 40\u00d7 objective; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using identical acquisition settings for all wells. The fluorescence intensity of polymerized actin was determined in 100 randomly picked cells/condition (Zeiss Axiovision software), averaged, and expressed relative to the medium-treated cells.Neutrophil Shape Change Assay 3 \u00d7 10 4 neutrophils suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 10 mM HEPES (without Calcium, Magnesium and Phenol red, shape change buffer, ThermoFisher Scientific) in a 96-well flat bottom plate were supplemented with 1 volume pre-warmed shape change buffer or diluted chemoattractant (10 \u22127 M fMLF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or 25 ng/mL CXCL8 (R&D Systems",
