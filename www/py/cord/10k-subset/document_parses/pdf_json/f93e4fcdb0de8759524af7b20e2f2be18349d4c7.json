            "text": "Pulmonary fibrosis is a common feature of interstitial pulmonary diseases. These disorders are progressive and refractory to current therapy and the limited fundamental therapeutic options are available to date. 1 A number of animal models and therapeutic agents were developed to explore the possibility of a new fundamental strategy against pulmonary fibrosis. Bleomycin-induced pneumopathy is a well-established model of pulmonary fibrosis, and the acute toxicity of bleomycin is characterized as the DNA damage of pulmonary tissue, which results in apoptosis. 2 Following the induction of apoptosis, immunological mechanisms including the further induction of apoptosis are also involved in the progression of the bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis. 3 On the other hand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is mitogenic and antiapoptotic factor for alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. It also stimulates the migration and morphogenesis of those cells as reported in the previous in vitro studies. 4, 5 Yaekashiwa et al 6 demonstrated that continuous systemic injection of recombinant HGF suppressed pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin in the mice model. HGF had significant effect when it was administered simultaneously or subsequently to bleomycin treatment. 6 Although these studies suggested the therapeutic potential of recombinant HGF for bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the feasibility of HGF gene transfer has not been fully explored. When delivered to the lung in vivo, in addition to the innate immune response or nonspecific inflammation, cellular and humoral immune responses are especially critical issues in the use of viral vectors. Furthermore, pathologically abnormal lungs present disease-specific barriers that can limit gene transfer. 7 In current clinical gene therapy, viral vectormediated gene transfer is the most popular gene delivery system. On the other hand, serious concerns regarding the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and induction of the host immune response limit their clinical desirability. When a retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer was used, an antihypertensive gene was transmitted to the offspring and integrated into its genome. 8 In liver-directed clinical gene therapy, adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer induced fulminant hepatic failure that lead to mortality. 9 Adenoassociate virus (AAV) vector have been found to be efficient for transducing nonproliferating cells and is considered to be nonpathogenic. Gene delivery by AAV vector also appears to be the least immunogenic of the viral vector systems. However, a major problem associated with the use of AAV vector has been the difficulty in producing large quantities of high-titer stock.",

The Mantel-Cox log rank test showed that the survival rate of mice with HGF was significantly improved compared with that of control mice (Figure 6 , Po0.0001). Discussion HGF 17 is a multipotent growth factor that acts as mitogen, 14 motogen, 18 and morphogen 19 on various epithelial cells. Furthermore, HGF also has an antiapoptotic effect on these cells 20 and fibrinolytic activity via upregulating urokinase-type plasminogen activator expression. 21, 22 Therefore, HGF has been obtained as a protective agent for a variety of organ disorders, such as liver cirrhosis, 23 intestinal ischemia, 24 myocardial ischemia, 25 and acute renal failure. 26 On the other hand, pulmonary fibrosis is the most common feature of interstitial pulmonary diseases and this disorder is progressive and refractory to current therapy. Limited fundamental therapeutic options are available to date. 1 A number of animal models and therapeutic agents were developed to explore the possibility of a new fundamental strategy against pulmonary fibrosis. Bleomycininduced pneumopathy is a well-established model of pulmonary fibrosis. Acute toxicity of bleomycin is characterized as the DNA damage of pulmonary tissue, which results in apoptosis. 2 As found in bleomycin-treated mice, 27 Fas expression in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells and upregulation of Fas ligand (FasL) expression are also found in clinical idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. 28 Furthermore, an activation of apoptotic pathway was found in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 29 or other experimental models, such as lipopolysaccharide, 30,31 hyperoxia, 32,33 asbestos, 34 and ischemia/reperfusion-induced lung injury, 35 Thus, apoptosis is a common feature found in both clinical and experimental models of lung injury. Following the acute toxicity of bleomycin, immunological mechanisms by T cells, its cytokines and natural killer cells also concern the progression of lung fibrosis. 3, 36, 37 In concurrence with these processes, extravasation of plasma through hyperpermeable vasculatures and injured alveolar walls occurs and tissue factor triggers the coagulation cascade, leading to fibrin deposition. 38 Fibrin matrix serves as a scaffold in which fibroblasts migrate and induce collagen deposition.",

Gene delivery by AAV vector also appears to be less immunogenic. However, a major problem associated with the use of AAV vector has been the difficulty in producing large quantities of high-titer stock. Therefore, we previously explored the in vivo nonviral gene transfer systems, such as particle delivery using gene gun [10] [11] [12] and electroporation using pulse generator, 13 to avoid these viral vector related problems. 8, 9 In the gene gun-mediated gene transfer to the mice liver, gene expression was observed even on day 1 and persisted for 2-5 weeks, and exclusive in the gene gun bombarded area. 10 With a regard to in vivo electroporation, we investigated the feasibility of HGF gene transfer via the portal vein in dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced rat liver fibrosis. HGF gene transfer attenuated the fibrotic change and prolonged the survival of DMN rats, and also reduced the apoptotic cell death. 13 However, these nonviral gene transfer methods also induced infiltration of inflammatory cells and mechanical damage in the site of gene transfer. On the other hand, in vivo lung-targeting gene therapy has been challenging due to the physical extracellular barriers, such as mucus, mucociliary clearance and glycocalyx proteins, and the innate or adaptive immunological systems. 7 Preclinical and clinical studies of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis suggested that current levels of gene expression were too low to achieve clinical benefit. Repetitive administrations of viral vectors were also limited by the formation of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, almost all previous studies including the lung-directed one used the diseased organ as a target site to induce efficient transgene expression locally. However, we should avoid putting the diseased organ at risk as the targets of gene transfer. Therefore, in this study, we selected the skeletal muscle as a gene transfer site using nonviral in vivo electroporation system to avoid these problems in lung gene therapy.",

However, its level would be efficient to demonstrate the physiological effects according to the previous reports on HGF gene therapy. 13, 41 As a result of our observations, skeletal muscle-targeting in vivo-electroporation could be performed with the advantages of simplicity, safety, and without toxicity to the diseased organ.",

Our results of hydroxyproline assay and histological evaluation indicated the certain effects of HGF gene transfer on suppression of fibrinogenesis in the bleomycin-injected lung. Furthermore, HGF gene transfer also reduced the apoptosis of the bleomycin-injected lung significantly. Concerning the survival analysis of bleomycin-injected mice, Hattori et al 42 reported the significant improvement of the survival rate of the mice deleted for the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene compared with that of wild-type mice. They suggested that the protective effect of PAI deletion could be attributed to the accelerated clearance of fibrin matrices. Their result emphasized the importance of fibrinogenesis suppression. In our study, the survival ratio of the bleomycininjected mice was significantly improved in HGFtransferred mice compared with GFP mice.",

First, the expression of GFP in skeletal muscle was confirmed in five of six mice at day 28 in our study. And in previous reports regarding the skeletal muscle-targeting electroporation, gene expression was confirmed even in 15 weeks after gene transfer. 43 Second, the physiological effect of HGF would be expectable even when its concentration decreased to undetectable level as reported previously. 41 Third, skeletal muscle-targeting electroporation-mediated gene transfer could be repeated without apparent immune responses. 44 Another problem of this study is electroporationrelated skeletal muscle damage. However, electroporation induced minimal damage of the skeletal muscle and mild degree of influx of inflammatory cells. And no dysfunction of the lower limb was observed in either group. These changes induced by electroporation were recovered within about 2 weeks in our preliminary study.",
