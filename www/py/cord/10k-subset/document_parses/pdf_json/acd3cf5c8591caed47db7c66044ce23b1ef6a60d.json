In recent years, developed countries have pressured many developing countries to implement TRIPS with stronger intellectual property (IP) protection than required by the TRIPS Agreement. The stronger provisions are called TRIPS-Plus provisions. This article focuses on IP and the health implications of limited access to medicines in China, explores the TRIPSplus arrangements in Chinese IP laws and regulations, and makes suggestions for China's negotiation strategy in resisting pressure from developed countries to tighten IP laws and regulations.",

TRIPS-plus refers to provisions that either exceed the requirements of TRIPS or eliminate flexibilities in implementing TRIPs. Some studies 2,3 forecast that TRIPS-plus would result in: delayed entry of generics into developing countries; significant price increases, and reduced access to medicines, thus posing serious threats to public health. China faces great pressure to tighten IP provisions, with a potential for negative health impact on the population of 1.3 billion.",

In 2009, there were an estimated 48 000 new HIV infections. 6 Government data released in 2010 show HIV/AIDS was the leading cause of death from communicable diseases. 7 Patent protection of HIV/AIDS drugs has impeded availability. China also has the greatest burdens of hepatitis B and liver cancer in the world. A 2006 national survey found an HBsAg carrier rate of 7.18 per cent in the total population, indicating that more than one-third of the world's hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers lived in China. 8 Control of infectious diseases remains a major problem in China, creating a great need for medicines at affordable prices.",

Government financial contributions to total health expenditures had increased from 15.47 per cent in 2000 to 27.23 per cent in 2009. 9 The percentage of total health expenditure paid by individuals also increased, from 20.4 per cent in 1978 to 38.2 per cent in 2009, peaking at 59 per cent in 2001. 9 High out-of-pocket payments expose individuals to the risk of catastrophic expenditure, which in 2011 affected 12.9 per cent of households. 13 According to China's 2008 national healthcare service survey, 25.1 per cent of patients who needed hospitalization did not get it; 70.3 per cent of these did not enter hospitals for financial reasons. 14 Patents keep medicine prices sufficiently high that unaffordability constitutes the main barrier to availability in China today. Three recent case studies [15] [16] [17] illustrate the severity of the problem: medicine prices, particularly for brand named drugs, remain significantly higher than international reference prices published at the Management Sciences for Health website (http://www.msh.org/resource-center/international-drugprice-indicator-guide.cfm). Although the government has taken many steps to reduce drug prices, results are not optimal. Drug expenditures in hospitals increased rapidly even after implementation of price controls. The average annual per hospital drug expenditure in China's general hospitals tripled from f14.1 million in 2002 to f45.1 million in 2009 9 ($1.00 \u00bc f6.36). The Chinese government has allowed doctors and hospitals a 15 per cent profit margin on drug sales. As doctors' incomes are greatly influenced by profits from drugs they have prescribed, they tend to aggravate the problem by prescribing more expensive drugs.",

The 1992 Chinese Patent Law Amendment provided 20-year patent protection on pharmaceuticals even before the introduction of TRIPS to the WTO (1995). India did not implement pharmaceutical protection until 2005, thus China has been more protective of IP, even as its own pharmaceutical industry has lagged. India has many more pharmaceutical patents, Drug Master Files (DMFs) that are submissions to the United States FDA, and plants in the United States than does China. 24 A higher standard of patent protection could result in losses for pharmaceutical industries in developing countries; China has lost public health advantage as compared with India -higher drug prices, lower drug availability, and underdeveloped domestic innovation capacity. 25 Six years of data exclusivity . Data exclusivity refers to protection of clinical test data that must be submitted to a regulatory agency to prove the safety and efficacy of a new drug, and prevents generic drug manufacturers from relying on these data in their own applications. This protection term is longer than that set out in TRIPS and in bilateral free trade agreements signed by the United States and other nations. Although protection of 'undisclosed data' against 'unfair commercial use' for 6 years is enshrined in China's law, there is a divergence of opinions between China and developed countries about certain key concepts such as 'new chemical entities' and 'unfair commercial use'. In China, the definition of 'new drug' is broader than NCEs, and the Chinese government has agreed only to protect undisclosed data of class 1 new drugs, those not marketed in China and abroad. The United States and EU want higher standards of data exclusivity; to expand the interpretation of 'new chemical entities'; and to redefine 'undisclosed data', so that the protection can cover class 3 new drugs (those that are marketed outside of China but not within). New estimates suggest that data exclusivity will increase China's health expenditure by 45.55 per cent on average per year from 2007 to 2009, while reducing the accessibility to 267 types of medicines by 27.14 per cent -a great negative impact on public health in China. 26 Policy makers should further investigate the potential impact of data exclusivity on the public health and on access to medicines.",

            "text": "In China, Articles 11 and 12 of the Drug Registration Regulation (2002) set a foundation for patent linkage. For filing a registration application, drug administration authorities require the manufacturer to declare that the drug does not infringe any third-party patent. Amendments to China's Drug Registration Regulation in 2005 add that a patentee may, on the basis of an infringement judgment, request that the SFDA revoke an approved drug registration. Patent linkage in the United States has no post-registration revocation rules. For years the SFDA and Chinese courts have been in conflict over post-registration revocation. The intricacy of patent disputes and lack of legal basis for SFDA's revocation led to amendments to Drug Registration Regulation in 2007. These deleted a provision related to SFDA's revocation of registration of an approved drug on the basis of an infringement judgment. Since 2008, SFDA has been posting patent related information from applications, including generic applicants' assertions of non-infringement, on an accessible website. Such publication served as a notice, even though Chinese patent linkage regulation does not require the SFDA or the drug applicant to notify the patent holder of these guarantees. 27 Although Chinese linkage regulations do not provide an automatic stay period, the threat of infringement litigation delays the entry of generic drugs. 27 Pfizer's Viagra patent dispute strongly illustrates this: SFDA withheld approval of generics based on patent disputes. China's patent linkage system can neither reduce infringement litigation nor the risks of infringement. Increasing criticism focuses on patent linkage, that it has exceeded the scope of the SFDA's competence. 28 Compulsory license and parallel import Why has no compulsory license been issued in China? Causes are many: low profits for generic drugs, few channels for appeals by patients, and government caution about trade frictions. In 2008, the not-for-profit hepatitis community and the HIV/AIDS community in China jointly published a letter appealing to the government to issue a compulsory license for GSK's antiviral drug, Lamivudine. In 2009, Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd submitted an application for compulsory licensing of Genetech's Tamiflu. China refused to grant such licenses in order to prove the government's determination to protect the rights of patent holders.",

Before the 2008 revision of the Patent Law, Chinese laws did not address the issue of parallel importation, mainly because prices were low. Article 69 of the new Patent Law (2008) provides for domestic and international exhaustion of patent rights and for parallel importation of the patented products without the patentee's consent, thereby ending the debate over the legitimacy of parallel importation. The new Patent Law does not clarify how exhaustion will apply to imported products sold outside of China under contractual restrictions. New issues will require judicial interpretation. We expect the relevant departments to clarify implementation of parallel importation, as it can be another important tool to improve access to medicines in China.",

Thus, patients suffer for lack of generic versions of some important drugs, including those for HIV/AIDS that appear on the WHO 'essential drug list', 31 as most ARV drugs retain patent protection in China and remain unaffordable. Compulsory licenses, even if not issued, can offer leverage to reduce prices to 'acceptable' levels. China's large generic drug manufacturing capacity strengthens its bargaining position -as does its enormous population. The Chinese government should encourage and support local generic drug companies to enhance their R&D and manufacturing capabilities.

(A worldwide definition of NCE would be important). K Stipulating a prescriptive registration period requiring an application for registration be filed within 1 year of first approval anywhere in the world.
