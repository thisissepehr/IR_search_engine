            "text": "Cells infiltrating the nonsensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organ of virus-antibody-flee rats exhibited surface immunoreactivity for ~2-microglobulin and immunoglobulin (Ig) E. They were further characterized by using immunohistochemical techniques with antibodies to cell-specific markers or histochemical techniques for immunocytes with surface receptors for IgE. Localization of intracellular granules immunoreactive for lactoferrin and CD18, a leukocyte adhesion molecule, unequivocally identified these cells as neutrophils. The low number of IgA-and IgG-immunoreactive B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and accessory immunocytes in the vomeronasal organ as well as the rest of the nasal cavity confirmed the absence of infection. We hypothesize that the operation of the vomeronasal pump induces repeated episodes of transient focal ischemia followed by reperfusion, which results in release of neutrophil chemoattractants and modulation of adhesion factors that regulate the extravasation and migration of neutrophils into the nonsensory epithelium. The distribution of immunoreactivity for interleukin 8 suggests that it is not the primary neutrophil chemoattractant in this system while that of CD18 suggests its active involvement in neutrophil extravasation. In addition to their role in immune surveillance, neutrophils may stimulate ion/water secretion into the vomeronasal lumen, affecting the perireceptor processes regulating stimulus access and clearance from the sensory epithelium.",

Histologically, the nonsensory epithelium appeared intact, and no obvious signs of tissue damage, such as epithelial sloughing, resulting from inflammatory responses were observed.

Sentinel rats routinely monitored for common rat pathogens were housed in the same unit as the experimental animals and remained pathogen-free. All bedding, food, and acidified water provided for these rats were also autoclaved. The animals were maintained on a 12 h light:dark cycle. All rats were perfused within 2 weeks of their receipt.

A few immunoreactive cells were also present in the lamina propria and adhering to the endothelial wall of the cavernous body ( Fig. la) . Rarely, a [~2microglobulin-positive cell was observed in or just beneath the sensory epithelium. The localization of a band of immunoreactivity at the edges of many cells and a discontinuous punctate pattern of immunoreactivity over some cells indicated cell-surface staining. As a first step in identifying the ~32-microglobulin-immunoreactive immunocytes, we considered the possibility that the cells were either B or T lymphocytes, cell types commonly found in mucosae. To test these possibilities, sections were stained with antibodies to the cz, 7, P, and ~ chains of IgA, IgG, IgM, and IgE respectively, whose cytoplasmic localization would identify the cells as Ig-producing B lymphocytes, and with antibodies to CD4 and CD8, which are membrane markers for helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, respectively (Table 1) . Only one or two cells per section in the nonsensory epithelium were weakly immunoreactive for IgA in a pattern suggesting cell surface localization (data not shown). Additionally, a few cells exhibiting cytoplasmic IgA immunoreactivity were localized near the vomeronasal glands. Numerous cells in the nonsensory epithelium and at the junctions between the sensory and nonsensory epithelium stained weakly in a pattern suggesting cell surface localization for IgG ( , and adhering to the endothelial wall of the cavernous body. IgE-immunoreactive cells were also observed infrequently in the connective tissue ventral to the sensory epithelium and rarely in the sensory epithelium. The pattern of IgE immunoreactivity indicated cell-surface staining (e.g., Fig. ld ). This suggested that the cells were not IgE-synthesizing B-lymphocytes but rather cells with surface receptors for IgE. Few T lymphocytes were present. In the lamina propria of the nonsensory epithelium, 4-6 CD4 + and 1-2 CD8 + positive cells per section, most adhering to the endothelium of the cavernous body, were observed. Rarely, a single CD4 \u00a7 and CD8 + positive cell was present in the lamina propria, and an occasional small cluster of 3-4 CD4 + cells but not CD8 + cells was observed in the nonsensory epithelium.

CD18 is a component of the heterodimeric MAC-l, which occurs on the plasma membrane of most mature leukocytes but intracellularly only in neutrophils (Arnaout et al. 1984; Gahmberg et al. 1992 ). In addition, the neutrophils exhibited immunoreactivity for IgE, IgG, lgM, and, infrequently, IgA in a pattern that suggested cell-surface staining. IgE binds to Mac-2/eBP receptors, S-type lectins that recognize carbohydrate domains, on human neutrophils (Truong et al. 1993) . IgG, IgM, and IgA bind to Fc receptors that have been localized on the surface membranes of neutrophils in several species (Anwar and Kay 1977; Furreil et al. 1992; Fanger et al. 1983) .",

            "text": "One well-documented condition in which neutrophils accumulate in the absence of infection is ischemia followed by the restoration of blood flow, or reperfusion; cerebral, pulmonary, hepatic, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion have served as models to study the mechanisms regulating neutrophil infiltration and associated tissue damage (for review, see Entman et al. 1991) . We hypothesize that in the VNO, cycles of mild, focal ischemia followed by reperfusion are caused by the operation of the vomeronasal pump, first described by Meredith and O'Connell (1979) . The action of the pump is based on the contraction and dilation of the cavernous body and other BVs in the lateral wall of the VNO in conjunction with the vomeronasal capsule, which provides a rigid framework for the organ, and distensible elastic fibers in the lamina propria of the nonsensory epithelium described by Hamlin (1929) and demonstrat-ed in this study by Biebrich scarlet staining. The pump functions to draw stimulus-bearing air or mucus from the nasal cavity into the fluid-filled lumen of the VNO and expel its contents back into the nasal cavity, ensuring access of stimuli to and their clearance from the sensory epithelium (Meredith and O'Connell 1979; Eccles 1982; Meredith 1982) . To activate the pump, adrenergic neuroeffector(s) are released from the sympathetic innervation of the BVs in the VNO (Meredith and O'Connell 1979) , causing vasoconstriction. Hypothetically, the resultant reduced blood supply due to vasoconstriction of BVs in the lamina propria of the nonsensory epithelium would cause mild ischemia. This could stimulate the local release of several substances that activate perivascular C fibers, as demonstrated in cerebral ischemia (e.g., Moskowitz et al. 1988 ). The BVs and nonsensory epithelium in the VNO are densely innervated by C fibers derived from the nasopalatine branch of the trigeminal nerve as well as by autonomic fibers. The fibers innervating the BVs are immunoreactive for substance P (Finger et al. 1989) , calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRR Silverman and Kruger 1989) , and nitric oxide synthase (Kulkarni et al. 1994) . When activated, these fibers would release the vasodilators substance P and CGRR as has been demonstrated in cerebral ischemia (e.g., Macfarlane et al. 1991a, b) , and presumably, nitric oxide. The ensuing vasodilation would result in reperfusion. Substance P additionally might act as a chemoattractant, while both substance P and CGRP might also stimulate neutrophil adherence to the endothelium (see below), resulting in neutrophil infiltration of the lamina propria and nonsensory epithelium.",

However, no infiltrating cells were observed in the human VNO (Getchell et al. 1993) , which lacks a bony capsule and is located within the lamina propria of the respiratory mucosa with no special relationship to large BVs (Johnson et al. 1985; Stensaas et al. 1991) . Additionally, the number of neutrophils in the nonsensory epithelium might be expected to increase as the animal ages, with continuous or repeated activation of the pump over time. Our results demonstrate such a relationship in virus-antibody-free rats, with no neutrophils present before birth, a gradual accumulation in the first few days of life, and large numbers in young adults.",

A specific attractant for neutrophils is IL-8 (Baggioiini and Clark-Lewis 1992) , which has been implicated in reperfusion injury in respiratory tract ischemia (Sekido et al. 1993 ). IL-8 was localized in vomero-nasal and posterior septal glands, in columnar cells in the nonsensory epithelium, and at the surface of the nonsensory epithelium, consistent with its previously reported localization in glands (Basolo et al. 1993; Anttila et al. 1992 ) and in human nasal epithelial cells (Bradding et al. 1993; Becker et al. 1993 ). However, this distribution of IL-8 suggests that it does not act as the primary neutrophil chemoattractant in the postulated ischemia/reperfusion-induced infiltration. Alternatively, substance P is also a chemoattractant for neutrophils, in some cases promoting neutrophil infiltration but not activation (e.g., Haines et al. 1993 ). As discussed above, substance P has been localized in fibers innervating the cavernous body, BV, and nonsensory epithelium; its release during ischemia would result in a distribution consistent with a possible role as a chemoattractant.",

            "text": "Neutrophils infiltrating a tissue must first adhere to the endothelium of a BV in the tissue and then migrate through the endothelium and perivascular tissue. Specific molecules expressed by both the endothelium and neutrophils in a precise temporal sequence regulate these processes (for review, see Butcher, 1992) . The initial \"capture\" and rolling of neutrophils is mediated by selectins, such as ELAM-1, on endothelial cells and their ligands on the neutrophils. Subsequent firm adhesion is mediated by adhesion factors, such as ICAM-1, on endothelial cells and its ligands, such as LFA-1 (CDlla/CD18) and MAC-1 (CD1 lb/CD18), on neutrophils. The level of expression of ICAM-1 is not affected by conditions simulating ischemia (Arnould et al. 1993) . However, the level of CD18 on circulating rat neutrophils is significantly upregulated following hepatic ischemia and reperfusion (Jaeschke et al. 1993) , and antibodies that block CD 18 interaction with its receptor prevent ischemia/reperfusion-induced neutrophil infiltration (Jaeschke et al. 1993) . The intense CD18 immunoreactivity observed on the surface of the neutrophils in the VNO is consistent with its role in their adhesion and migration into the nonsensory epithelium. The localization of CD18 but not CDlla on these neutrophils suggests that the MAC-1 complex may be involved in adhesion and extravasation of these neutrophils as has been demonstrated in intestinal epithelial monolayers (Parkos et al. 1991) . CGRR which may be released from trigeminal innervation in response to ischemia as discussed above, has also been demonstrated to increase the adherence of neutrophils to endothelium (e.g., Sung et al. 1992 ). The timing of neutrophil adhesion, migration, and accumulation relative to ischemia/reperfusion and the identification of other adhesion factors that play a role in infiltration of the VNO are questions of interest for future studies.",

            "text": "Activated neutrophils release proteolytic enzymes and generate superoxide free radicals, resulting in tissue damage (e.g., Gallin, 1984) . The absence of apparent tissue histopathology in the nonsensory epithelium, with no signs of cell sloughing or epithelial damage, strongly suggests that the neutrophils infiltrating the tissue were not activated. One possible explanation for the apparent lack of activation is that the neutrophils may migrate through the nonsensory epithelium and into the lumen before activation occurs. It has been demonstrated that neutrophils isolated from ischemic liver after 1 hour of reperfusion do not secrete superoxide radicals or cause observable tissue necrosis but those isolated after 5 hours of reperfusion do (Jaeschke et al. 1990; Jaeschke and Farhood 1991) . However, because we did not measure indicators of neutrophil activation and mediators of tissue damage, the possibility exists that a low level of activation might occur. At least 2 superoxide scavenging systems that might protect the BVs and the nonsensory epithelium from damage have been localized in the VNO. We have previously demonstrated the dense innervation of the cavernous body and small BVs in the lamina propria of the nonsensory epithelium by nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive fibers (Kulkarni et al. 1994) . The endothelial and possibly neuronal release of nitric oxide, which scavenges superoxide free radicals (Kubes et al. 1993) , may reduce the occurrence of tissue damage. Also implicated in inactivating the highly reactive and destructive oxygen free radicals are the superoxide dismutases, whose expression is upregulated in hippocampal glia (Liu et al. 1993 ) during ischemia/reperfhsion and which prevent or lessen superoxide damage when added to ischemic tissue (e,g., Uyama et al. 1992 ). The epithelial cells in the nonsensory epithelium exhibited strong immunoreactivity for both Mn and CuZn superoxide dismutase, suggesting that even if a low level of neutrophil activation were occurring, tissue damage due to superoxide anions might be minimal due to the high levels of these enzymes.",

Migration of nentrophils across intestinal epithelial monolayers reduces the transepithelial resistance through effects on transcellular and paracellular pathways. The transcellular resistance decrease is due to the early stimulation of chloride and obligatory water secretion ) by 5'-AMP, a neutrophil-derived secretagogue (Madara et al. , 1993 . Subsequently, a paracellular resistance decrease results from a transient increase in the permeability of tight junctions between the epithelial cells (Nash et al. 1987) . The nonsensory epithelium is essentially an epithelial monolayer (e.g., Breipohl et al. 1979 ) whose apical surface consists of a mucociliary complex in contact with the fluid in the VNO lumen. A neutrophil-derived secretagogue may stimulate a transcellular movement of chloride ion and water into the VNO lumen that, along with secretions from the vomeronasal glands, contributes to the maintenance of fluid in the lumen, which is likely to be essential to the delivery of stimuli to and their clearance from the sensory epithelium. In addition, the neutrophils provide immune surveillance for the presence of pathogens in the material drawn from the nasal cavity into the VNO and can act as a first line of defense in preventing their invasion of the VNO.",
