Although it is considered essential for all healthcare workers to be immunized against influenza A (H1N1) to prevent the spread of influenza A (H1N1) to patients as the pandemic evolves, previous studies that have examined the acceptability of seasonal influenza vaccination among healthcare workers have generally demonstrated a low acceptance rate of vaccination in this group [6, 7] . Among all healthcare workers, nurses constitute the largest group with the highest frequency of contacts with patients and staff [8] . Previous findings of the acceptability of seasonal influenza vaccination in nurses showed that their acceptance of vaccination was lowest among all healthcare workers [6, 7, 9, 10] . Acceptability of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination in healthcare workers has been shown to be low [11] [12] [13] . A survey conducted in Greece found that only 17% of hospital healthcare were willing to receive influenza A (H1N1) vaccination [11] . Of all healthcare workers, nurses were found to have the lowest rate of acceptability of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination [12, 13] . A study of Italian healthcare workers showed 31% of nurses willing to accept vaccination compared to 67% of physicians [12] . In a study conducted of Hong Kong healthcare workers in hospitals, it was found that only 25% of nurses were willing to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination, compared with 47% of doctors and 29% of allied professionals [13] . General practitioners working in the community in France also report a high rate of acceptability of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination at 62% [14] . It is therefore not surprising that a recent online poll conducted in the UK suggested that nurses may be unwilling to receive pandemic influenza vaccination [15] . In a cross-sectional survey that was conducted on experienced nurses who were members of the nursing professional organizations in Hong Kong, the vaccination rate for seasonal influenza vaccination was about 50% [16] . In a more recent survey that explored influenza A (H1N1) acceptance rate in the same group of nurses [17] , it was found that only 13% were willing to accept vaccination for influenza A (H1N1) compared to 38% who plan to receive the seasonal influenza vaccination. However, in the study, there was a low response rate of 28% of nurses with different clinical settings. There is a lack of studies in Hong Kong looking at influenza A (H1N1) vaccination acceptability particularly in the community setting. Nurses who work in the community may be the first group to be in contact with patients who are affected with the influenza A(H1N1) infection. A recent study [18] showed differences in the concerns in using new vaccines during a pandemic than using established vaccine in a non-crisis situation.
