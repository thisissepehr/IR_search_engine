Recent studies at the Division of Animal Health seem to indicate that a killed vaccine is unlikely to be protective, even though vaccination with large doses of killed virus in bland adjuvant stimulates extremely high levels of neutralising antibody (Della-Porta and Snowdon 1975) . While disappointing, the result is not entirely surprising as CSIRO workers had realised at the outset that the chances of developing an effective killed vaccine were somewhat slim and probably significantly less than the chances of developing a protective live vaccine. In this connection, Snowdon (1970) reported that vaccination with passaged strains of Ephemeral Fever virus effectively protected cows against challenge with virulent virus. Nevertheless, CSIRO workers decided to attempt to develop a killed vaccine for reasons of safety. An important consideration in the original rejection of a live vaccine by these workers was the perceived danger of its use in the field being associated with the emergence of virulent virus after passage through the vector. In this connection, virus has been isolated recently from Anopheles bancrofti (St. George et ul 1976) but in view of the limited geographical distribution of this insect, it is clear that it is not the only vector involved; indeed, it may be of relatively minor importance in the southward spread of the disease from the endemic area in the north. Nevertheless, the isolation of virus from this insect allows experiments to be undertaken to Australian Veterinary Journal, Vol. 52, August, 1976 determine whether passage of laboratory-manipulated virus through the insect is associated with a reversion to virulence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 314, "text": "Hofstad, M.
