            "text": "We have previously shown that human mRNAs are present in saliva and can be used as biomarkers of oral cancer. In this study, we analyzed the integrity, sources, and stability of salivary RNA. Methods: We measured the integrity of salivary RNA with reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) or RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). To study RNA entry sites into the oral cavity, we used RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA from the 3 major salivary glands, gingival crevice fluid, and desquamated oral epithelial cells. We measured stability of the salivary \u2424-actin mRNA by RT-qPCR of salivary RNA incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. We measured RNA association with other macromolecules by filtering saliva through pores of different sizes before performing RT-qPCR. To assess RNA-macromolecule interaction, we incubated saliva with Triton X-100 for different periods of time before performing RT-qPCR. Results: In most cases, we detected partial-to fulllength salivary mRNAs and smaller amounts of middle and 3 gene amplicons compared with the 5. RNA was present in all oral fluids examined. Endogenous salivary \u2424-actin mRNA degraded more slowly than exogenous \u2424-actin mRNA, with half-lives of 12.2 and 0.4 min, respectively (P <0.001). Salivary RNA could not pass through 0.22 or 0.45 m pores. Incubation of saliva with Triton X-100 accelerated degradation of salivary RNA. Conclusions: Saliva harbors both full-length and partially degraded forms of mRNA. RNA enters the oral cavity from different sources, and association with macromolecules may protect salivary RNA from degradation.",

Samples were stored on ice during the collection, and Superase Inhibitor (Ambion) was added to samples immediately after the collection, to a final concentration of 100 units/mL. Samples were then stored in \u03ea80\u00b0C, or RNA was isolated immediately. Stratified saliva secretions were stimulated by citric acid. Parotid saliva was collected as described by Lashley (20 ) , using a Lashleylike cup that was fabricated by the UCLA Life Science Machine Shop. Submandibular and sublingual saliva collections were obtained by use of a Wolff collector according to the published protocol (21, 22 ) . GCF was collected with the paper strip sampling technique with minor modifications (23 ) . Briefly, 5 sterile paper strips (Periopaper) were gently inserted into the mesiolabial or distolabial gingival sulcus between the upper anterior teeth within 2 mm. To prevent saliva contamination during GCF collection, oral fluid was first removed with cotton rolls at the sampling site and the site was dried with a gentle stream of air. After 90 s of GCF isolation, the strips were placed in microcentrifuge tubes containing 500 L of phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton X-100. When blood contamination was noticed on the strip during the GCF sampling, the paper strip was discarded. Oral epithelial cells were collected by use of a Cytology Brush (Medical Packaging). The buccal mucosa was brushed gently 5 times after the field was dried by use of dental gauze. The Cytology Brush was then place in a microcentrifuge tube containing 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton X-100 for 30 min. The oral epithelial cells were centrifuged at 14 000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The volume of whole saliva collected from each participant, shown in Fig. 2 , ranged from 2 to 4 mL. The volume of parotid saliva collected was 1.0 -1.5 mL, the volume of submandibular saliva was 0.50 -0.70 mL, and the volume for the sublingual collection was 0.03-0.05 mL.",

For \u2424-actin DNA calibrator, \u2424-actin cDNA was amplified by use of 5\u0408 forward primer (see Table 1 in the Data Supplement that accompanies the online version of this article at http://www.clinchem. org/content/vol52/issue6/) and a reverse primer, 5\u0408-TCAAGTTGGGGGACAAAAAG-3\u0408, which ends at nucleotide 1694 of \u2424-actin cDNA. The gel-extracted PCR product was inserted in the pCR2.1-TOPO vector by use of TOPO TA cloning reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The insert was confirmed by sequencing and PCR. Reverse transcription was performed with specific reverse primers at 42\u00b0C for 45 min. We generated calibration curves by use of serial dilutions of the plasmid DNA. The amounts of RNA from other regions were expressed relative to the 5\u0408 region. microarray U133 plus 2.0 microarray chips (Affymetrix) were used, and the experimental procedure was described previously (4 ) . The dchip program was used to analyze the data (24 ) .",

We refer to these transcripts as the normal salivary core transcriptome (NSCT). As a first step to understand these NSCT mRNAs, we evaluated the integrity of 5 NSCT mRNAs from 8 healthy participants. The genes that we selected were \u2424-actin, RPS9, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), IL8, and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT) mRNAs. \u2424-Actin, RPS9, and GAPDH are cellular housekeeping genes, and their transcripts are present at high concentrations in saliva (6 ) . IL8 and SAT were used as oral cancer biomarkers in our previous study (4 ) . To first validate the presence of these mRNAs in the saliva samples, we performed RT-PCR using primers that yield short PCR amplicons that range from 88 to 154 bp (Fig. 1A) . These 5 genes, their full-length mRNAs, the expected sizes of the PCR amplicons, and the locations of these amplicons on the mRNA (in parentheses) are listed in Fig. 1A . In all participants, we were able to successfully detect short PCR amplicons for all 5 mRNAs (Fig. 1B) . Initially for participant 3, no amplicons or only small amounts were detected, likely because of the small amount of starting RNA material in the saliva. We detected all 5 mRNAs (Fig. 1B , lane 3*) in participant 3 by use of a 5-fold higher amount of RNA and 5 additional PCR cycles compared with the other samples. These data confirm that the NSCT mRNAs are present in the saliva of healthy persons.",

As a control for degradation of nonsalivary RNA, we added purified total RNA from an ES-LW1 mouse cell line to the human saliva at the beginning of the incubation and monitored the stability of m\u2424-actin mRNA. Because the \u2424-actin primers used in the experiments reported in Figs. 1 and 2 recognize both human and mouse \u2424-actin mRNAs (data not shown), we used species-specific primers for this analysis (h\u2424-actin and m\u2424-actin primers). As shown in Fig. 3A , within 1 min of incubation, \u03fd10% of m\u2424-actin mRNA was detected. In contrast, the salivary h\u2424-actin mRNA concen- tration did not decrease significantly, and even after 20 min of incubation, we recovered \u03fe40% of h\u2424-actin mRNA (Fig. 3B) . The half-lives of mouse cellular \u2424-actin and human salivary \u2424-actin mRNAs were 0.4 and 12.2 min, respectively (P \u03fd0.001).

To test this, we filtered saliva through 0.22 and 0.45 m size pores and measured the amount of \u2424-actin mRNA in the filtered fractions by RT-qPCR. To exclude the possibility that these filters bind nonspecifically to RNA, we filtered purified human total RNA through different size pores and recovered \u03fe80% of the \u2424-actin mRNA (see Fig. 1a in the online Data Supplement). The amount of filtered RNA is expressed as a percentage of the amount of unfiltered RNA. We found that the amount of salivary \u2424-actin mRNA recovered from 0.22 and 0.45 m pores was \u03fd5% (see Fig. 1b in the online Data Supplement). In addition to the saliva samples, we also measured RNA-macromolecule associations in serum and found that \u03f38% and \u03fd1% of \u2424-actin mRNA could be detected in serum filtered through 0.45 and 0.22 m pores, respectively (see Fig. 1c in the online Data Supplement).

As a control, saliva was incubated with water instead of Triton X-100, and the RNA stability of these samples was measured as well. As shown in Fig. 4 , saliva mixed with water showed no markedly reduced amount of salivary \u2424-actin mRNA for up to 20 min. However, incubation of the saliva with Triton X-100 dramatically accelerated the disappearance of the amount of salivary \u2424-actin mRNA. After 10 min, \u03fd5% of \u2424-actin mRNA could be detected, suggesting that most of the salivary RNA was degraded.

            "text": "We previously showed the presence of human mRNA in saliva (4, 6 ) . In this study, we presented the first characterization of salivary RNA. For 4 of the 5 genes analyzed, we found long PCR amplicons from at least 1 participant, suggesting that some salivary transcripts are present in full-length forms. In addition, many of these salivary RNAs are likely to contain a poly(A) tail because our microarray (Fig. 2B ) data were generated with oligo(dT)based cDNA synthesis followed by amplification (4, 6 ) . Our data suggest that different persons have different concentrations and species of long RNAs, possibly because saliva harbors different microorganisms that have different amounts and types of endo-and exoribonucleases, which affect the stability and length of salivary RNA. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, there are at least 2 known types of human nucleases that are active in saliva (8, 11 ) , and different individuals may have different amounts of these nucleases. The presence of partially degraded RNA suggests that endonucleases rather than exonucleases are primarily involved in the degradation of salivary RNA, because exonucleases are usually processive, degrading the target RNA substrates completely or giving rise to significant degradation on one end of the mRNA, as has been shown for plasma RNA (26 ) . On the other hand, endonucleases tend to produce partially degraded products when their concentrations are limited, with no preferential degradation at either end (29 ) . Consistent with this idea, the data in panels D and E of Fig. 1 show that although the assay detected lower amounts of 3\u0408 regions compared with the 5\u0408 regions, it detected even lower amounts of the middle region, which suggests that there is no preferential degradation from either end. We have shown that RNA enters the saliva of the oral cavity from various sources; it is therefore likely that the degradation we observed in the whole saliva mixture is the outcome of different nucleolytic activities.",

MUC5B forms oligomers that are highly glycosylated (30 ) , and it is possible that in saliva, some RNA is associated with these oligomers. However, this cannot be the only type of RNA-macromolecule complex because we detected RNA in the saliva from the parotid gland that lacks MUC5B. It has been speculated that in plasma, RNA-associated macromolecules are apoptotic bodies (13, 28 ) . Indeed, incubation of RNA-containing apoptotic bodies with serum protected RNA from degradation (31 ) . In addition, it appears that DNA in the blood originates from apoptosis or necrosis (32 ) . Therefore, it is a possibility that some of these salivary RNA are present in apoptotic bodies. At time 0, saliva supernatant was mixed with either Triton X-100 or water (no Triton) and incubated for up to 20 min at room temperature. For RT-qPCR, salivary \u2424-actin was measured. The amount of RNA quantified at each time point was normalized to the amount of RNA at time 0. Saliva samples from 4 participants were used.
