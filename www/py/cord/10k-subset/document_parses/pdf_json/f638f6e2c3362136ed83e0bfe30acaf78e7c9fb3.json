However, there is no clear evident on the effect of the regulation of ER stress and mitochondrial function by Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the prevention of intramuscular fat metabolism. We investigated the effects of ACE2 on ER stress and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle lipid metabolism. Methods: The triglyceride (TG) content in skeletal muscle of ACE2 knockout mice and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice were detected by assay kits. Meanwhile, the expression of lipogenic genes (ACC\u03b1, SREBP-1c, LXR\u03b1, CPT-1\u03b1, PGC-1\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b1), ER stress and mitochondrial function related genes (GRP78, eIF2\u03b1, ATF4, BCL-2, and SDH6) were analyzed by RT-PCR. Lipid metabolism, ER stress and mitochondrial function related genes were analyzed by RT-PCR in ACE2overexpression C2C12 cell. Moreover, the IKK\u03b2/NF\u03baB/IRS-1 pathway was determined using lysate sample from skeletal muscle of ACE2 knockout mice. Results: ACE2 deficiency in vivo is associated with increased lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle. The ACE2 knockout mice displayed an elevated level of ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in skeletal muscle. In contrast, activation of ACE2 can ameliorate ER stress and mitochondrial function, which slightly accompanied by reduced TG content and down-regulated the expression of skeletal muscle lipogenic proteins in the db/db mice. Additionally, ACE2 improved skeletal muscle lipid metabolism and ER stress genes in the C2C12 cells. Mechanistically, endogenous ACE2 improved lipid metabolism through the IKK\u03b2/NF\u03baB/IRS-1 pathway in skeletal muscle. Conclusions: ACE2 was first reported to play a notable role on intramuscular fat regulation by improving endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial function. This study may provide a strategy for treating insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.",

More importantly, the signaling pathway activated by the ER stress has emerged as a critical regulator of lipid biosynthesis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and apoptosis [1, 2] .",

            "text": "Excess lipid accumulation and impairment in mitochondrial function have been considered as putative mechanisms for the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Mitochondria modulate the balance between lipid metabolism and storage in the skeletal muscle. \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids (FAs) is linked to ATP production, mitochondrial respiration [3] , and redox balance [4] . Muscle mitochondria regulate the transport and \u03b2-oxidation flux of long-chain fatty acids [5] . Mitochondrial deficiency as the cause of impaired fatty acid oxidation capacity and skeletal muscle fat accumulation, ultimately leading to the mitochondrial-driven 'lipotoxicity' hypothesis of insulin resistance [6] . Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IR [7, 8] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) decreases the generation of Ang II by catalyzing the conversion of Ang II to angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)). Ang-(1-7) elicits the opposite effect of Ang II [9] . Recently, we reported that ACE2 regulates mitochondrial function in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, and ACE2 inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathway to preserve hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis [10, 11] . Moreover, the beneficial protection against ER stress in heart and lung by ACE2 is reported [12, 13] . However, there is no direct evidence that ACE2 regulates ERS and mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle.",

PGC-1\u03b1 has been implicated in the regulation of skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. As a transcriptional coactivator, PGC-1\u03b1 activates several transcription factors to drive transcription of vast gene networks involved in many aspects of energy homeostasis, including glucose utilization and fatty acid oxidation, as well as mitochondrial biogenesis and function [15] . Some key transcriptional regulators, such as LXR\u03b1 and SREBP-1c, coordinately control the lipogenesis, which increase the expression of key lipogenic genes, including those for FAS, SCD1 and ACC [16] . ACC1 converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA and inhibits fatty acid entry into the mitochondria reducing \u03b2 -oxidation. In this study, we illustrated that skeletal muscle TG contents were significantly higher in the ACE2 \u2212/y mice than that in the WT mice. Subsequently, we also found the mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation genes PGC-1\u03b1, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, CPT-1\u03b1 and MCAD decreased in the ACE2 KO mice, and increased in the ACE2-overexpressing C2C12 cells and the db/db mice.

Indeed, mitochondria and ER interact at contact points, called mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes, in order to exchange calcium (Ca 2+ ) and lipids, thus regulating cell metabolism and fate [15] . In consequence of ER stress, an adaptive process named UPR is triggered. Three distinct branches of the UPR system can be initiated by transmembrane effector signal transduction proteins-protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1\u03b1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The UPR consists of three signaling branches which are initiated by signals such as the dissociation of BiP (GRP78) from the intracellular receptor domains of the ER. These signals activate combinations of the three stress sensors, protein kinase RNA-like PERK, ATF6 and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 \u03b1 (IRE 1\u03b1). CHOP is a downstream effector of all the three branches of the UPR [18] . Enhanced CHOP expression has several effects on cells including alteration of the balance of pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins that act on mitochondria [18] . In RAS, Ang II and ACE2 have been reported to induce ER stress via GRP78/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/ CHOP axis in the liver [10, 19] . In the present study, the . The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of n = 3 independent experiments in C2C12 cells, n = 3 in Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 versus Ad-GFP cell or Ad-GFP-treated mice by Student's t test changes in GRP78/eIF2\u03b1/XBP-1/ATF4/CHOP expression suggested that ACE2 ameliorates ER stress in skeletal muscle and liver may through the same pathway. The mechanism underlying this process could involve the ability of ACE2 to regulate GRP78/ eIF2\u03b1/ XBP-1/ATF4/ CHOP pathway. Mitochondria regulate energy homeostasis by metabolizing nutrients, generating ATP and heat. In skeletal muscle, substantial pieces of evidence show that mitochondrial dysfunctions, in terms of number and functionality, are jointly liable for IR [20, 21] . The respiratory electron transport chain complexes I-IV which transfer the electron in the inner mitochondria membrane and the ATP-synthase enzyme (Complex V) play a critical role in mitochondrial oxidation [22] . Here, we showed that SDHB, NDUFB8 and UQCRC2 were down-regulated in the ACE2 KO mice. Consistently, NDUFB8 and UQCRC2 were down-regulated in the Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice. These data suggested that ACE2 can improve skeletal muscle mitochondria function by regulating respiratory electron transport chain complexes.",

            "text": "Activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription NF-\u03baB has been connected to the impairment of insulin signaling induced by the ER stress in skeletal muscle [23] . The UPR is mainly mediated by the activation of IRE-1\u03b1, PERK/ eIF2-\u03b1, and ATF6 signaling pathways. These three cellular pathways can interact with several inflammatory signals, including NF-\u03baB [24] . It has been reported that UPR reduces the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 through several mechanisms [25, 26] , which results in NF-\u03baB activation and the regulation of genes involved in inflammation and insulin resistance [24] . Given that accumulation of intracellular lipid species can activate cellular signaling cascades conducive to NF\u03baB activation [27] , we check the IKK\u03b2/NF\u03baB signal pathway. Of interest, ACE2 down-regulation resulted in the increased Fig. 3 ACE2 regulated ER stress and mitochondrial function in ACE2-overexpressing C2C12 cells and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice. a: Relative gene expression levels of ER stress-related genes (GRP78, Eif2\u03b1, ATF4 and XBP-1) in ACE2-overexpressing C2C12 cells. b: Relative gene expression levels of BCL-2 and IL-6 in ACE2-overexpressing C2C12 cells. c: H&E-stained histology of gastrocnemius muscle in the Ad-ACE2-treated and Ad-GFP-treated db/db mice (100\u00d7 H&E). d: Relative gene expression levels of ER stress-related genes (GRP78, Eif2\u03b1, ATF4 and XBP-1). e: Relative protein levels of eIF2\u03b1 and CHOP in the skeletal muscle of Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice. f: Relative gene expression levels of NDUFB8, SDHB, UQCRC2 and mt-ND1 in the skeletal muscle of Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice. g: Relative protein levels of NDUFB8 and Bcl-2 in the skeletal muscle of Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice. The data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD of n = 3 independent experiments in C2C12 cells, n = 3 in Ad-ACE2treated db/db mice. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 versus Ad-GFP cell or Ad-GFP-treated mice by Student's t test expression of the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b2 and NF\u03baB in the skeletal muscle of the ACE2 KO mice. The insulinsignaling pathway requires insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 and IRS-2). IRS-1 has a major role in skeletal muscle [28] . Serine hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 is a marker of IR in peripheral tissues, which leads to subsequent activation of PI3K pathway [29] . Akt is a key protein involved in PI3K pathway, its phosphorylation promotes the metabolic activities in skeletal muscle [30] . It's remarkable that ACE2 down-regulation increased expression of the phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the skeletal muscle of the ACE2 KO mice. However, one previous study showed that phosphorylated Akt in the soleus muscle equally in the standard diet-fed ACE2KO mice compared with the WT mice [31] . These findings suggest that ACE2 mediate ER stress and mitochondria function in intracellular lipid metabolism, which was involved in the regulation of the IKK\u03b2/NF\u03baB/IRS-1 pathway, but not Akt pathway.",
