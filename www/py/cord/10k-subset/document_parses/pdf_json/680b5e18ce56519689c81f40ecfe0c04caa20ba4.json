Blomqvist et al. found that 22% of all children had at least 1 rhinovirus infection by 6 months of age [44] . Although we do not have incidence data on infection, our hospitalization data suggest that the children hospitalized with rhinovirus may not be at greater risk of infection but instead may be more likely to have a worse outcome. In the few studies investigating rhinovirus infection in asymptomatic children who have underlying asthma, the proportion with rhinovirus tends to be lower (10%-12%) [12, 16] than in other studies of asymptomatic children without asthma (18%-20%) [27, 45] . A recently published study evaluating the role of viruses in outpatient respiratory illnesses in a birth cohort of children 0-1 year of age found that 69% of ARIs were viral, and, of those, 48.5% were attributable to rhinoviruses. These investigators also found that 11.5% of asymptomatic children in the birth cohort were infected with rhinoviruses and were reported to be clinically well within the 4-week period surrounding viral detection [46] . We found a similar distribution among hospitalized children, with a 44% detection of rhinoviruses in the viral-positive specimens.",

First, we did not test concurrent healthy controls to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic rhinovirus shedding. However, we did perform viral surveillance in all enrolled children and did not detect additional viruses in the majority of the children with rhinovirus. Although it is possible that rhinovirus infection was an incidental finding in children with other viral or bacterial pathogens, few of the children had viral coinfections detected. In addition, the rate of asymptomatic rhinovirus infection from previous studies is less than the rate of infection seen in the present study [12, 27, 42, [45] [46] [47] [48] . Another limitation is that we only evaluated rhinovirus during a single year, and the seasonality may not reflect the rates in other years or other geographic areas. Although surveillance hospitals included at least 95% of county children admitted with fever or respiratory illness and we adjusted for nonenrolled children and nonsurveillance days, enrolled children may not have been representative of the entire county populations. Finally, although the present study utilized sensitive PCR methods coupled with culture, we may have failed to detect some viruses due to RNA instability, low titers, or as-yet unidentified viruses. Although some studies have suggested higher detection rates with nasal aspirates/washes rather than nasal/throat swabs, other studies have not confirmed these findings [8, 49] . Swabs are more acceptable to families.",
