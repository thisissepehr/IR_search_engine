In CF with the F508del mutation, the defective CFTR has previously been shown to induce an upregulation in transglutaminase activity. This enzyme, in turn, drives the crosslinking and the subsequent disabling of Beclin-1, a key protein that is needed for autophagy activation. Once autophagy is impaired, there is a corresponding increase in p62. Since p62 has been shown to regulate the aggresome formation, its accumulation effectively traps the F508del-CFTR in the ER and prevents its trafficking to the cell surface. An effective autophagy activator, should, in theory, reverse this sequence of events and allow more of the misfolded CFTR to reach the cell surface.

Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Introduction: CFTR/ABCC7 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. Unusually for this family, CFTR operates as an ion channel, rather than a transporter. ABC transporters are thought to operate as pumps by undergoing major structural changes which move the transported allocrite from an inwardly-exposed to outwardly-exposed location within the transmembrane domains (TMDs). This alternating access-type mechanism is coupled to the binding of ATP which triggers the dimerisation of the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) followed by ATP",

Combinations of single substitutions acted additively and yielded NBD1 constructs with highly increased thermostability of that domain (results are presented in another poster [Yang et al.]). In the present study, the effects of these NBD1-stabilizing substitutions on the folding and trafficking of full-length wild-type CFTR in a mammalian expression system, and their effects on the monodispersity and thermostability of detergent-purified CFTR, were investigated. Recombinant CFTR proteins containing different combinations of the second-site substitutions were overexpressed in the stable mammalian cell system developed in our lab (Hildebrandt E, et al. Mol Biotechnol. 2015;57:391-405). These CFTR proteins contained a His-affinity purification tag, and extracellular FLAG epitope and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tags to facilitate fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). FACS analyses of anti-FLAG antibody binding to the extracellular FLAG tag indicated significantly increased levels of cell surface expression of NBD1-stabilizers over that of wild-type CFTR. The CFTR proteins were purified using a protocol optimized in our labs (Hildebrandt E, et al. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2014;1838:2825. Fluorescence size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) of the purified proteins indicated improved monodispersity of the NBD1-stabilized CFTR protein.",

Unfolding occurred over a broad temperature range between 45-75 o C which is consistent with the sequential unfolding of several CFTR domains. Most NBD1-stabilizing substitutions also increased the T m of full-length CFTR, and a positive correlation was observed between their respective unfolding temperatures (T m   ) . Still, a low-temperature transition in the fluorescence signal at ~10-20 o C is apparent in some data and if this represents an unfolding event in the protein, it may suggest that additional domains besides NBD1 need to be stabilized to further optimize CFTR stability.",

Comparison of biochemical and functional assays indicated that augmented levels of mature CFTR did not necessarily correspond with an increase in CFTR function. In cultures from CF patients expressing P67L, S1251N, G178R, R117H, or R347P mutations, maximal levels of CFTR function in Ussing chambers were obtained when treated with VX-809 plus a low dose of VX-770, while levels of mature CFTR protein varied for each mutant. Although these functional assays measure chloride secretion, CFTR also secretes bicarbonate. Rescue of bicarbonate secretion by P67L, S1251N, and G551D was strongly enhanced by VX-770 in combination with VX-809, and maximum bicarbonate secretion by the G178R mutant was obtained using VX-809 combined with a high concentration of VX-770. Thus, for certain mutations, CFTR modulators displayed different effects on chloride versus bicarbonate secretion. To determine which results are physiologically relevant, we used airway spheroids to conduct fluid 2016 Cystic Fibrosis Conference 198 transport assays. Airway spheroids from CF patients expressing G551D/ F508del or S1251N/F508del showed an increase in swelling due to CFTR activity in response to VX-770. Airway spheroids from CF patients homozygous for F508del/F508del were not significantly rescued by treatment with VX-809. These results accurately correspond with the outcomes of CF patients receiving these therapies in the clinic, thus demonstrating that airway spheroids can be used as a precise preclinical model for identifying therapeutics specifically tailored for each CF patient.",

            "text": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a tightly regulated anion channel which mediates cAMP-stimulated salt and fluid secretion and enables efficient mucociliary clearance in the airways. Most CF is caused by the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 which disrupts the folding, trafficking, gating and surface stability of the mutant. CFTR interactions with other proteins have been studied extensively and it is thought to form protein complexes that localize and stabilize it at the cell surface. Membrane lipids may also play a role in these processes but have received much less attention. We recently showed that wt-CFTR forms sub-resolution clusters that are homogeneously distributed on the plasma membrane of primary human airway epithelial cells. Our studies of CFTR protein dynamics revealed two dynamically distinct populations. One population exhibited small spatial scale transport dynamics and confinement that was dependent on membrane cholesterol suggestive of its localization in lipid rafts. A second population of CFTR molecules had larger spatial scale dynamics indicating CFTR lateral mobility outside the rafts. To better understand the importance of CFTR clustering for its membrane expression and stability and its possible role in CF, we have now compared the aggregation state and lateral mobility of wt-CFTR with F508del-CFTR rescued by treating cells with VX-809. The distribution of wt-and F508del-CFTR was studied in primary human bronchial epithelial cells using spatial image correlation spectroscopy (ICS). CFTR dynamics were studied using a modified version of k-space image correlation spectroscopy (kICS). To quantify the fraction of wt-CFTR and F508del-CFTR within cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, and their mobility, transport and partitioning dynamics of these populations were compared under control conditions and following chronic treatment with VX-809 or in combination with the potentiator VX-770. ICS analysis showed that the aggregation state of wt-CFTR is much higher than F508del-CFTR despite treatments with the corrector or in combination with the potentiator. kICS analysis revealed that F508del-CFTR partitions into lipid rafts under control conditions, but the confinement is significantly weaker and a smaller fraction of the population displays confinement when compared with wt-CFTR. VX-809 correction does not restore the normal confined fraction or confined dynamics of F508del-CFTR, neither does the additional potentiation with VX-770, confirming that these treatments do not correct F508del-CFTR membrane behavior. The results show a clear dependence of CFTR distribution and dynamics on cholesterol and suggest that the reduction in F508del-CFTR confinement could be due to an alteration in its interaction with cholesterol which is not restored by CFTR modulators.

This linking methodology takes advantage of intracellular enzymes to enable the release of two biologically active components (i.e., cysteamine and DHA) inside cells at the same time and in equimolar concentrations. This process allows the simultaneous inhibition of transglutaminase 2 and the upregulation of AMPK to take place and enable a more effective restoration of Beclin-1 and autophagy. In cultured primary homozygous F508del hBE cells, the fatty acid cysteamine conjugate CAT-5571 synergistically activated autophagy at concentrations as low as 0.3 \u03bcM. This level of activity was observed only with the covalent conjugate and could not be replicated by administering the individual components either individually or in combination, even at much higher concentrations. Once autophagy had been restored in these primary CF hBE cells, an increase in the trafficking of the F508del-CFTR was observed, as noted by an increase in the CFTR band C. When CAT-5571 was used in combination with the corrector VX-809 and the potentiator VX-770, it showed an additive effect, as measured by the increase of chloride conductance in a functional assay using cultured primary homozygous F508del hBE cells.

The structure in the absence of ATP will be presented. Biophysical data will also be presented that show that the purified protein in a detergent micelle has a spatial distribution of cysteine residues that is consistent with current homology models. The data also imply that G551D-CFTR is more stable than the wild-type protein. The structure will be compared with other ABC proteins where high-resolution structures are available and also with the density map of CFTR obtained previously from two-dimensional crystals (Rosenberg MF, et al. J Biol Chem. 2012; 286:42647-54) . In the absence of ATP, the transmembrane domains of G551D-CFTR show an outwardfacing configuration, with a deep and wide central channel that is closed on the cytoplasmic side of the TMDs by the intracytoplasmic loops. The NBDs are in a closed dimeric configuration, but density for ATP cannot be observed. Density for the extracellular loops is weak, implying that these regions of the protein are relatively mobile, or disordered in the outward-facing conformation. Regions of density around the NBDs and not accounted for by homologous ABC transporters such as Sav1866 is probably due to the regulatory region (R-region) which must be phosphorylated before channel opening can happen.",

            "text": "The new structure for CFTR may provide new insights that will allow structure-directed design of therapeutics for the targeted treatment of CF-causing mutations. In this study, we evaluated P67L CFTR, a mutation associated with pancreatic sufficiency and present in a comparatively small cystic fibrosis patient population (curated by CFTR2 (www.CFTR2.org)). Historically, P67L has been designated a class IV conductance abnormality (i.e., malformed ion pore). In contrast, our studies demonstrate P67L disrupts CFTR protein maturation, prompts misfolding, causes gating defects, and exhibits conductance very similar to wild-type. We also show that P67L CFTR is robustly rescued by lumacaftor or ivacaftor, both in cell lines and primary airway epithelia, although unresponsive to low-temperature correction. To further elucidate the impact of this mutation during protein biogenesis, second-site suppressors R555K or R1070W were introduced in concert with P67L. These experiments, together with pronounced lumacaftor correction and absence of 27\u00b0 C rescue, suggest a model in which P67L is necessary for proper formation of the NBD1/cytosolic loop interface and/ or stability of TMD1. Our findings (and those of others) therefore suggest the importance of clinical studies to test pharmacologic correction in CF subjects carrying the P67L defect. We note that lumacaftor rescue of P67L CFTR might not have been anticipated based on previous CFTR class IV assignment. For rare (ultra-orphan) CFTR mutations such as P67L, access to novel therapeutics is often constrained by difficulty arranging phase III clinical trials, and restrictions on off-label use when drug cost is prohibitive. Analysis of low prevalence cystic fibrosis alleles offers a means for assessing barriers to \"personalized\" medicine, and engaging the best available mechanistic knowledge towards treating patients with rare forms of the disease.

Molecular Function and Structure, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; 2. Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; 3. Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an unique anion channel of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. CFTR consists of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and a regulatory (R) domain. CFTR also has alpha-helical extensions and intracellular loops (ICLs) which couple the NBDs and MSDs via \"coupling helices.\" The regulation of CFTR channel activity involves protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation at the R domain. However, little is known of the effect of phosphorylation on the intramolecular interactions relating to CFTR channel activation. Previous studies of a similar ABC transporter, BtuCD, have shown that intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence can detect urea-sensitive changes in the coupling between the MSDs and NBDs of full-length BtuCD. Interestingly, we have found that urea-sensitive changes of CFTR were similar to studies of BtuCD and were modified upon PKA phosphorylation. Tryptophan quenching of CFTR was also modified by PKA phosphorylation and suggests this modifies an electrostatic environment of CFTR. Based on CFTR homology models, the ICL:NBD interface has many tryptophans, such as W401 at NBD1, and has a phosphorylation site at Serine-422 which may provide an electrostatic environment. Our biophysical studies then led us to propose that phosphorylation may modify the coupling of ICLs and NBD1 which may be essential for CFTR channel activation. In order to specifically study those interfaces, cysteine crosslinking studies in HEK293 cells were employed using a short membrane-permeable cysteine crosslinker on a CFTR mutant lacking its native cysteine residues (cys-less) with two cysteines engineered at the interfaces of interest. We did not detect any cysteine crosslinking at the ICL1:NBD1 interface with either R170C/W401C or R170C/E476C cys-less WT CFTR. However, we did detect a shift in SDS-PAGE gel migration of all single-and double-cysteine mutants which suggests that these cysteines may be accessible to crosslinker modification. We were able to detect a specific intramolecular interaction at the ICL4:NBD1 interface with V510C/A1067C cys-less WT CFTR. However, we were unable to detect any changes at the ICL4:NBD1 interface upon PKA phosphorylation. These results were similar to previous studies by He L, et al. (J Biol Chem. 2008; 283(39) :26383-90) which suggest either that the coupling helices of ICL1 and ICL4 are stably interacting with NBD1 regardless of phosphorylation status or that subtle changes in the affinity of this interaction cannot be detected by chemical crosslinking. Consistent with the latter suggestion, our initial studies of disease-causing mutations in the coupling helices of ICL1 and ICL4 show that they exhibit a defect in phosphorylation-dependent channel activation. Together, biophysical studies of reconstituted fulllength CFTR protein and cell-based studies of coupling mutants support the hypothesis that such coupling interfaces play a key role in the intramolecular signaling required for CFTR channel regulation.

Second-site mutations that thermally stabilize NBD1 not only promote the maturation and thermal stability of F508del CFTR but also that of wild-type CFTR, and these strategies have been used to increase the expression and maturation levels of CFTR for its purification and structural studies. Although progress has been made in the purification of more thermally stable CFTR, further improvement is still required to enable high resolution structural analyses. Current methods of monitoring CFTR thermal stability using the most informative biophysical methods such as differential scanning calorimetry require relatively large amounts of purified proteins at high concentrations. In this study, using an engineered cys-less CFTR, we developed a maleimide fluorophore (DyLight800) binding assay to monitor changes with temperature of a single introduced cysteine using membranes from CFTR-expressing cells. Using this method, we found that second-site mutations in NBD1 and ATP binding increased the peak labeling temperature of 524C. We also found that nanobodies specific to NBD1 altered the temperature-dependent labeling of 524C in cys-less CFTR, corresponding to their effect on the thermal stability of isolated NBD1. Thus rapid screening of constructs was enabled prior to purification. To then follow the thermal unfolding of improved constructs with a biophysical assay (intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence), small amount of proteins were purified and scanned by nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (Nano-DSF) using a Prometheus NT.48 (NanoTemper Technologies). Using this instrument, we were able to determine the melting temperature (Tm) of full-length CFTR and isolated NBD1 with a concentration as low as 0.1 mg/mL protein and 10 \u03bcL sample size. Second-site mutations increased the Tm of full-length CFTR as well as isolated NBD1, as previously determined using other techniques. In addition, nanobodies that bind to and thermally stabilize NBD1 increased the Tm of full-length CFTR. Knowledge gained from this study will enable us to develop strategies to further thermally stabilize CFTR. (Supported by the NIH and CFF.)",

            "text": "Gene therapy holds promise for cystic fibrosis using approaches including gene addition or gene editing. Gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 offer the possibility of modifying the CFTR locus, and correction could persist if progenitor cells were modified. DNA double-strand breaks can be introduced using CRISPR/Cas9 to either modify a specific locus by introducing insertions or deletions (indels) from repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or to enhance homology-directed repair (HDR) and obtain precise gene corrections by homologous recombination. We are investigating both strategies to evaluate repair of representative classes of CFTR mutations. An intron mutation in the CFTR, 3849+10Kb C>T, creates a novel splicing donor site 10 kb into intron 22-23. This mutation, therefore, is a candidate for disruption by NHEJ. In contrast, the deletion mutation in the exon 11 of CFTR, F508del, needs a repair template, in addition to CRISPR/Cas9 editing, to make precise replacement of the mutation with the correct wild-type sequence. Here, we utilize single or dual Staphylococcus pyogenes (Sp) Cas9-and/or Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) Cas9-specific single guide RNAs introduced by non-viral or viral delivery to remove and or replace the deleterious mutation and effect repair by NHEJ or HDR. We screened 8 pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (targeting indel 22-23) and 10 single sgRNAs (targeting exon 11) to identify those that most efficiently introduced double-strand breaks at these 2 regions of the gene. We next tested the efficacy of different delivery vectors by assessing the nature of indels, the indel efficiency, Cas9 expression, vector genome copy numbers, vector persistence and HDR efficiency in cell lines and primary airway epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that both SpCas9 and SaCas9 genome editing can disrupt mutation and/or induce correction by HDR at different regions of CFTR locus.",

AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA; 3. Present address: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Lexington, MA, USA Splice site mutations account for 12% of the over 2000 CFTR gene mutations identified in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The c.1766+1G\u2192A splice site mutation is one of the 16 most common CFTR mutations worldwide. In the CFTR2 global database, ~0.6% of patients with CF have at least one c.1766+1G\u2192A allele. However, the structural and functional defects of CFTR caused by this splice site mutation at the donor site of intron 13 remains unclear. In addition, the effects of F508del CFTR modulators on this CFTR splice site mutant are still unknown. To characterize c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR and explore potential therapeutic strategies, we studied heterologous primary hBE cells with the F508del and c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR mutations (patient code: CFBr002). RT-PCR analysis indicated that this splice site mutation causes CFTR exon13 skipping (87bp), which results in a deletion of 29 amino acids from Arg560 to Ser589 in CFTR. This missing segment is located at NBD1 domain and contains the Walker B motif in the ATP binding site 1. These results are consistent with early reports by Strong, T.V. et al. (Hum Mutat, 1992; 1:380-7) . Moreover, F508del and c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR genes in this heterozygous donor encoded Met470 and Val470, respectively. Equivalent TECC current studies indicated there were no effects of forskolin and F508del potentiators on these heterozygous primary hBE cells in the absence of F508del-CFTR correctors. Compared to homozygous F508del-CFTR primary hBE (patient code: CFFT028H), combined F508del correctors and potentiators have lower efficacy in CFBr002, suggesting that c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR has impaired chloride channel function.",

Western blot analyses revealed only a weak Band B in the three c.1766+1G\u2192A stable cell lines compared to WT-CFTR expressing cells, suggesting the splice site mutant causes impaired biogenesis and maturation defects. Common F508del CFTR correctors (C7 (PTC124), C17, C18) and a series of AbbVie compounds (such as AC1, AC2a, AC2b, and AC2c) significantly increased c.1766+1G\u2192A Band B, but did not produce Band C individually. However, a combination of two compounds, such as AC1/AC2c and C18/AC2c, resulted in the production of Band C in CFBEs, suggesting that these compounds work together to promote c.1766+1G\u2192A CFTR maturation. The rescued band C protein could not be activated by forskolin or forskolin plus several different F508del-CFTR potentiators, including VX-770, PG-01, and Genistein, implying c.1766+1G\u2192A channel function is also defective.

Particularly valuable are functional cell models that can be propagated but conserve their ability to grow as well-differentiated airway epithelia for personalized chloride transport measurements. Thirteen CF subjects with common and rare CFTR mutations provided airway cell samples from nasal or tracheobronchial tissues. Three CF individuals were genotypically characterized by carrying the common F508del mutation on both alleles (F508del/F508del), four CF individuals had a rare CFTR mutation on the other allele (F508del/3905insT, F508del/1154insTC, F508del/Y563N, F508del/A455E), and six CF individuals had two rare CFTR mutations on both alleles (G551D/Y1092X, G542X/3849+1kb C->T, V520F/1717-1G->A, G85E/1717-1G->A, G542X/1248+1G->A, W1282X/W1282X). Primary CF cells were cultured in presence of Y-27632 Rho kinase inhibitor and irradiated 3T3 murine fibroblasts to induce a proliferative state (CF-CRC). Cell numbers were expanded through serially passages, seeded (5x10 5 cells/cm 2 ) onto Snapwell inserts, and grown at an air-liquid interface to induce differentiation. The activation of mutant CFTR Clcurrents by a small molecule potentiator (VX-770) and corrector was studied by measuring the acute responsiveness to forskolin and VX-770 (1\u03bcM) followed by CFTR inhibitor 172 (50 \u03bcM). CF-CRCs from three CF patients homozygous for F508del responded to VX-770 acutely at passages 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 but showed a trend to decline at passage 10. Prior treatment with VX-809 (3 \u03bcM, 12-24 h) enhanced F508del-CFTR currents ~2-fold. Responsiveness to VX-770 was detected in CF-CRCs from three patients carrying the F508del mutation on one allele and included F508del/3905insT, F508del/1154insTC and F508del/Y563N, whereas no response was found in one patient who carried the F508del/A455E genotype even after treatment with VX-809. Responsiveness to VX-770 was detected in two CF patients who carried rare CF mutations on both alleles and included the stop mutation Y1092X (G551D/ Y1092X) and the splice mutation 3849+10kb C->T (G542X/3849+10kb C->T); enhancement by VX-809 was also observed. In contrast, no responsiveness to VX-770 was found for the splice mutation 1717-1G->A in two CF patients carrying V520F/1717-1G->A or G85E/1717-1G->A. Similarly, no responsiveness was found for 1248+1G->A in a patient with the G542X/1248+1G->A genotype and a patient homozygous for the stop mutation W1282X. The limited numbers of CF patient-derived cells can be expanded through conditional reprogramming and used to assess efficacy of CFTR-targeted compounds. These data suggest the utility of CRCs for personalized ion transport measurements in Ussing chambers and demonstrate responses to small-molecule potentiators (VX-770) and correctors (VX-809) for a selected number of rare CF genotypes.

All compounds tested were able to open channels from the different mutants in an efficient manner. This was determined in YFP halide assays using other class III and IV CFTR mutants, performed by transient transfection of the CFTR mutant in HEK293 cells with iodide influx measured after addition of forskolin and potentiator.

            "text": "In summary, we describe the identification of a second-generation potentiator series with very good channel opening activity. From this series, GLPG2451 was identified and is currently entering clinical trials. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and other S-nitrosothiols are endogenous cell signaling compounds that have potential relevance to cystic fibrosis (CF) and other human lung diseases. S-nitrosylation signaling is metabolically regulated and it is often disordered in pulmonary diseases including CF. GSNO levels are low in the CF airway, in part because of increased expression of GSNO reductase (Zaman K, et al. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2016; 310:L263-70) . Co-chaperone C-terminus Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, helps to target improperly-folded CFTR for degradation (Younger M, et al. J Cell Biol. 2004; 167:1075-85) . CHIP is of particular interest to our research because it co-localizes with CFTR and interacts with the chaperones Hsc70, Hsp70, Hsp90, and co-chaperone Hop. CHIP has eight cysteine residues, and has the potential to act as an S-nitrosylation motif. We have previously shown that an active site cysteine in another E3 ubiquitin ligase, protein von Hippel Lindau, is inhibited by S-nitrosylation (Palmer L, et al. JCI 2007; 117:2592-601) . Therefore, we hypothesized that CHIP could be modified by GSNO to prevent CFTR degradation. Furthermore, inhibition of the expression and function of CHIP, Hsc70, Hsp90 and Hop by S-nitrosothiols could not only improve CFTR expression and maturation, but also may affect its cell surface stability (Oklyoneda T, et al. Science. 2010; 329:805-10) . Here, we found that CHIP is expressed in CFBE41ocells expressing both F508del and wild-type CFTR. Our study showed that 10 \u03bcM GSNO significantly decreases CHIP expression after 4 hours (4.0-fold, and 3.6-fold respectively, p<0.002). To characterize further the interaction of CHIP with CFTR, we knocked down endogenous CHIP with 50 nM of CHIP siRNA duplexes. 48 h after transfection, the level of CHIP was decreased (3.5-fold, p<0.002) , and this produced an increase in levels of immature and mature forms of F508del CFTR (1.5-fold and 1.8-fold) . However, in the presence of GSNO, the increase of F508del CFTR maturation was more significant (1.8-fold and 2.8-fold, p<0.005) . In addition, we demonstrated that GSNO S-nitrosylated CHIP in a concentration-dependent manner. To confirm that F508del CFTR is expressed on this cell surface following knockdown with siRNA CHIP, we performed cell-surface labeling. After CHIP knockdown, levels of full F508del CFTR maturation on the cell surface increased (2.1fold, p<0 .002). However, the presence of GSNO ensured that the increase of CFTR maturation was more pronounced (3.4-fold, p<0.005) . Of note, the proteosome inhibitor MG132 prevented depletion of cellular CHIP levels after GSNO treatment (2.4-fold, p<0 .005), and GSNO-treated cells have less-ubiquitinated CFTR (3.4-fold, p<0 .001) than GSNO-untreated cells, suggesting that S-nitrosylation of CHIP inhibits CFTR ubiquitination by targeting CHIP for degradation and/or inhibiting CHIP function. We believe our observations will offer a novel approach in identifying the key mechanism by which S-nitrosothiols S-nitrosylate CHIP so as to increase CFTR maturation and prolong F508del CFTR cell-surface expression.

Department of Biological Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA Coupling of ATP hydrolysis at CFTR's nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and gating transitions in its transmembrane domains (TMDs) is an operational hallmark for this transporter-turned ion channel, whose defective function is responsible for cystic fibrosis. Exactly how this coupling occurs remains debated, but previous reports of a charge-neutralization mutation in CFTR's 6th transmembrane segment (R352C or Q in TM6) enable direct visualization of ATP hydrolysis-driven gating transitions due to the existence of two distinct open-channel conductance levels (smaller O 1 and larger O 2 ), and a preferred pattern of C-->O 1 -->O 2 -->C transition over C-->O 2 -->O 1 -->C, which indicates a violation of microscopic reversibility and hence demands an input of free energy likely from ATP hydrolysis. While cysteine scanning CFTR's 5th TM (TM5) with negatively charged 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES \u2212 ), we also found two open-channel conductance levels for N306C/Cysless-CFTR after MTSES \u2212 modification with the same preferred gating topological pattern of C --> O 1 --> O 2 --> C. Similar phenotypes were observed with N306D-or N306E-CFTR, suggesting that introducing a negative charge at this very position confers this unique behavior. Whereas R352Q/C and N306D/E are mutations with a net subtraction of a positive charge in the internal vestibule of CFTR's pore, even with the net charge unaltered, by altering the position of endogenous positively charged side chains at R303 and R352 along TM5 and TM6 respectively, we could observe similar O 1 -O 2 states and asymmetrical gating transitions, indicating that the position of the charge in the inner vestibule also affects sub-conductance. To further understand the structural/biochemical mechanism underpinning this hydrolysis-driven O 1 to O 2 transition, we examined the effects of channel-permeant blocker SCNand channel-impermeant blocker MOPSon O 1 and O 2 states. While these two states show indistinguishable sensitivity to SCNblock, MOPSblocks the O 1 state more than it does to the O 2 states when the net charge of the inner vestibule is unchanged or increased. Unexpectedly however, when the net charge in the internal vestibule of CFTR's pore is decreased, this differential sensitivity to MOPSblock no longer exists. A two-step blocking mechanism is proposed to explain the differential responses of pre-hydrolytic and post-hydrolytic open states to MOPSblocking: MOPSfirst docks to the inner vestibule of pore before it sojourns deeper into the pore. Furthermore, we propose, based on what we know about the gating conformational changes in CFTR, that the internal vestibule is expanded during O 1 to O 2 transition so that the mutation-induced charge perturbations cause a diminished electrostatic attraction or repulsion to the MOPSfrom the internal vestibule in the O 2 state. This expansion of the internal vestibule during ATP hydrolysis also explains why the single-channel conductance of the O 2 state is higher than that of the O 1 state. Collectively, the current study not only affirms and perhaps generalizes the O 1 -O 2 phenotype, but also provides a large toolbox for future mechanistic studies of CFTR gating by ATP hydrolysis. membrane and partially restores chloride transport. Unfortunately, there are few small molecules that specifically target NBD1. Lumacaftor, which partially restores CFTR folding and trafficking, must be present during synthesis for maximal effect, suggesting that it acts by facilitating proper folding of one or more transient biosynthetic intermediates. Understanding and manipulating the cotranslational NBD1 folding pathways therefore provides a potential approach for CFTR correction. To address these challenges, we isolated ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) and measured FRET between donor and acceptor fluorophores that were incorporated into NBD1 during its synthesis to define the NBD1 cotranslational folding pathway (Khushoo A, et al. Mol Cell. 2011; 41:682-92 and Kim SJ, et al. Science. 2015; 348:444-8) . These studies revealed a highly orchestrated sequential folding pathway that depends on biosynthetic machinery, translation rate, and primary sequence. To overcome low concentrations of RNCs obtained from in vitro translation systems (1-5 nM) , RNCs were immobilized on Nickel-NTA/IDA beads to increase the effective local concentration and enable quantitative fluorescence measurements via high-content microscopic imaging. This system allowed rapid assessment of nascent polypeptide folding and was scalable for high-throughput screening in 384well format. Bead imaging provided exceptional sensitivity that allowed detection of attomol quantities of protein (6 x 10 5 molecules/bead), and high degree of reproducibility (Z' score of 0.6-0.8). Quantitative imaging of immobilized RNCs allowed interrogation of (i) length-dependent structural changes of cotranslational folding intermediates at virtually any stage of synthesis, (ii) nascent protein folding in ribosome attached and released states, (iii) structural effects of disease-associated mutations, and (iv) correction of these defects by complementary genetic manipulation. Moreover, RNCs isolated from cell-free translation reactions are stable at room temperature and amenable to cryopreservation, enabling scaling efforts needed for screening consistency. These results therefore provide a novel platform to identify small molecules that interact with de novo folding intermediates as well as full-length protein, while avoiding problems associated with large-scale purification of unstable or low-yield substrates.

Department of Chemistry, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Clchannel. Increasing evidence suggests that CFTR dysfunction is also a significant contributor to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CFTR potentiators increase CFTR activity and might be a potential therapeutic strategy for COPD patients in addition to CF patients. It was reported that the approved CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor, reduces F508del-CFTR cellular stability and has multiple off-target functions necessitating the discovery of novel potentiators. We recently found that IOWH-032, OSSK-2, and OSSK-3 function as blockers and potentiators of human CFTR (hCFTR). Here, we report the identification of nearly 80 candidates from the ZINC database discovered using pharmacophore modeling analysis by removing the pore-blocking moiety of IOWH-032, OSSK-2, and OSSK-3. Moreover, we screened the candidate compounds with two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) and found multiple compounds that potentiated without detectable block of WT-hCFTR expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The most potent compounds were further tested with inside-out macropatch recordings. The compounds potentiated WT-hCFTR from the intracellular side when the channels were activated with low concentration of protein kinase A (PKA, 6.4 U/ mL) in the presence of 1 mM MgATP. The compounds also potentiated F508del-CFTR under similar experimental conditions. Further studies will test the effects of the above compounds on hCFTR expressed in human airway epithelia in Ussing chambers. In future work, we will reiterate the pharmacophore analysis with the updated pharmacophore model to identify more high efficiency potentiators.

Univ. of Pittsburgh School of Med., Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; 2. Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 is a modifier associated with accelerated lung disease in patients with \u0394F508. Our published data demonstrate that TGF-\u03b21 represses CFTR mRNA and prevents corrector-mediated rescue of the \u0394F508-CFTR. Repression of \u0394F508-CFTR may explain, in part, the limited efficacy of corrector and potentiator in recent clinical trials. Studies were conducted to elucidate TGF-\u03b21 effectors responsible for CFTR repression in order to develop strategies to precisely eliminate the pathogenic activity. TGF-\u03b21 controls expression of several microRNAs (miRNAs), including miRNA-145 that inhibits CFTR post-transcriptionally, acting on the miR-145 target sites in CFTR. Studies in \u0394F508-homozygous primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial (CF-HBE) cells were conducted to examine whether TGF-\u03b21 upregulates miRNA-145. First, we examined expression of miRNA-145 in CF-HBE cells after TGF-\u03b21 treatment by qRT-PCR. TGF-\u03b21 significantly increased miR-145 expression as a function of time (n=3 in triplicates in different CF-HBE cells; P<0.05). We observed a reciprocal decrease in CFTR mRNA (n=3 from different tissues in triplicates; P<0.05). Expression of miR-145 was completely blocked by TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor, SB431542. Published studies demonstrate that miRNA-145 levels are increased in CF-HBE cells, compared to non-diseased controls while TGF-\u03b21 gene polymorphisms are associated with high TGF-\u03b21 levels. We hypothesized that if miRNA-145 expression in CF-HBE cells is regulated by TGF-\u03b21, the miRNA-145 levels should differ between CF patients. Thus, we examined expression of miRNA-145 in CF bronchial tissues obtained at lung transplantation under an IRB-approved protocol, by in situ hybridization and compared to tissues with no known disease (negative control) or emphysema (positive control). A blinded reviewer assigned the score between 0 and 3 based on the miRNA-145 expression in the bronchial epithelium. The expression of miRNA-145 was 0 in negative controls, compared to +3 in the positive controls, and was variable at +1, +2, or +3 in the CF samples (n=3 in triplicates in each group). On-going studies examine miRNA-145 expression in CF bronchial epithelium, TGF-\u03b21 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and TGF-\u03b21 gene polymorphisms. Next, we examined whether miRNA-145 inhibitors attenuate TGF-\u03b21 repression of CFTR. Differentiated CF-HBE monolayers were treated with TGF-\u03b21 and either the locked nucleic acid (LNA TM )-conjugated miRNA-145 inhibitor control (Exiqon Inc.; miRNA-145-inh-CTRL) or miRNA-145 inhibitor (miRNA-145-inh). miRNA-145-inh blocked TGF-\u03b21-stimulated miRNA-145 expression, compared to miRNA-145-inh-CTRL and partially attenuated the TGF-\u03b21 repression of CFTR. Next, we demonstrated that the LNA TM -conjugated miRNA-145 mimic reduced CFTR mRNA in non-diseased HBE monolayers in the absence of TGF-\u03b21 stimulation. Taken together our data provide strong evidence that miRNA-145 is a TGF-\u03b21 effector repressing CFTR in CF bronchial epithelium. Strategies to block CFTR repression by miRNA-145 may promote efficacy of correctors to restore the \u0394F508-CFTR function in CF patients.",

At lower concentrations (5-25 \u03bcM) , resveratrol did not affect the forskolin-stimulated, CFTR-inh172-sensitive short circuit currents (Isc) . However, at higher concentrations (50-100 \u03bcM), resveratorol inhibited the forskolin-stimulated Isc (p<0.01, N=12 from 4 different donors). Resveratrol also inhibited VX-809-rescued Isc in CF-HBE cells (p<0.05, N=9 from 3 different donors). As control, resveratrol did not affect the amiloride-sensitive Isc, irrespective of concentration. At high concentration, resveratrol inhibited CFTR protein abundance (58\u00b14% vs. CTRL at 4h and 32\u00b15% vs. CTRL at 24h; N=3 per group from 3 different donors); however, it had no effect on CFTR mRNA levels. To determine effects of resveratrol on CFTR protein stability we inhibited new protein synthesis with cyclohexamide. Resveratrol did not alter CFTR protein stability, indicating that it does not stimulate CFTR protein degradation. Taken together the data indicate that resveratrol inhibits CFTR Clchannel function by interfering with CFTR post-transcriptionally, in the biosynthetic pathway. Resveratrol works via several context-dependent mechanisms, including activation of class III histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The deacetylation reaction catalyzed by SIRT1 is coupled to the cleavage of a cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). SIRT1 activity is critically dependent on the availability of cellular NAD+. Resveratrol increased NAD+ generation indicating activation of SIRT1. The specific SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527, or the dominant negative (DN)-SIRT1 partially rescued resveratrol inhibition of CFTR protein levels in CFBE41o-cells. SIRT1 exerts its metabolic effects via inhibition of a potent inducer of protein synthesis, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Blocking mTOR activity with rapamycin decreased CFTR protein levels, similar to resveratrol, suggesting that mTOR plays a role in the resveratrol-and SIRT1-mediated inhibition of CFTR. Current studies focus on confirming the role of mTOR in CFTR biosynthesis. Taken together our studies demonstrate a novel CFTR biosynthetic pathway and determine that the common nutritional supplement resveratrol may compromise the corrector-mediated rescue of mutant CFTR.",

NEAT1 has been shown to regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 in other diseases. Consistently, we find that suppression of NEAT1 in CF lung epithelial cells leads to reduced expression of IL-8 expression. Additionally, NEAT1 is induced by p38-MAPK signaling pathway, which is activated in CF, and our results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway suppresses both NEAT1 as well as IL-8. NEAT1 has been shown to prevent the binding of a repressor protein, SFPQ (splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich) to the IL-8 promoter and thereby induce increased expression of IL-8. Interestingly, our data indicate that SFPQ is down-regulated in CF cells compared to control cells. Overexpression of SFPQ in CF cells, not only suppress IL-8 but also induces increased expression of F508del-CFTR protein. Consistently, knockdown of SFPQ in CFTR-repaired control cells leads to enhanced IL-8 mRNA expression and reduction in CFTR protein levels.",

            "text": "After synthesis, F508del-CFTR is selected by molecular chaperones, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ubiquitinated, and targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by the cytoplasmic proteasome because it fails to achieve a transport-competent conformation. Existing small molecule F508del-CFTR correctors modestly improve maturation of the mutant protein, though they have no effect on CFTR ubiquitination as measured in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining CFTR correctors with inhibitors of protein ubiquitination would increase the pool of F508del-CF-TR protein available for correction, leading to synergistic improvements in F508del-CFTR trafficking and function. As a proof-of-principle, we discovered that the pyrazone compound PYR-41, which inhibits the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), decreased F508del-CFTR ubiquitination, and led to a small but significant increase in band C and in chloride currents when added in combination with VX-809 compared to treatment with VX-809 alone. Through targeted screening of structural analogs of PYR-41 and other known inhibitors of the ubiquitination machinery, we identified additional compounds that decrease the ubiquitination of CFTR as well as select model substrates. The majority of compounds fall into two classes: inhibitors of the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), and inhibitors of ubiquitin ligases (E3s) such as CHIP. When combined with VX-809, some of these newly identified inhibitors promote increased F508del-CFTR trafficking and protein function beyond what we observed when we combined VX-809 and PYR-41. We are continuing to screen potential inhibitors in an effort that is guided by the evolving structure-activity relationships and assisted by structural modeling of the E1 and E3 enzymes with existing inhibitors.

Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA ERp29 is a 29 kDa thioredoxin-homologous protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that displays chaperone-like properties. Interestingly, ERp29 has only a single cysteine instead of the usual C-X-X-C thioredoxin motif. In addition to displaying chaperone-like properties at both the biophysical and cellular levels, ERp29 also has demonstrated roles in cortical neuron protection, suppressing tumorigenesis and regulating connexin 43 hemichannel biogenesis and assembly. We have previously demonstrated that ERp29 promotes CFTR biogenesis (Suaud et al. J Biol Chem. 2011; 286:21239-53) , and, as the biogenesis of CFTR and ENaC share a number of features, we subsequently demonstrated that ERp29 also regulates ENaC biogenesis and functional expression (Grumbach Y, et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2014; 307:C701-9) . In particular, these studies demonstrated that overexpression of wt ERp29 increased ENaC functional expression, most likely due to increased cleavage of cell surface ENaC, whereas overexpression of a mutant ERp29 lacking its single cysteine (C157S ERp29) decreased ENaC functional expression due to decreased ENaC cleavage at the surface. ERp29 overexpression also promoted the interaction of both ENaC and CFTR with the coat complex II (COP II) ER exit machinery, whereas C157S ERp29 overexpression decreased this interaction. These data suggested a model where ERp29 may promote ENaC cleavage during biogenesis by directing ENaC to the Golgi where it would be subject to cleavage by furin. We thus further hypothesized that ERp29's subcellular localization would be a key determinant of its regulation of ENaC and CFTR biogenesis. ERp29's C-terminal ER retention motif is KEEL, a KDEL variant that is associated with less robust ER retention. To assess if ERp29's retention at or its release from the ER are critical for its regulation of ENaC and CFTR biogenesis, we designed mutant ERp29s containing either a KDEL retention motif (ERp29 KDEL) that should be better returned to the ER from the proximal Golgi by the KDEL receptor, or a mutant where the retention motif was deleted (ERp29 \u0394KEEL) that would interact less well with the KDEL receptor, and therefore potentially better escape the ER. Interestingly, ENaC functional expression was decreased by ERp29 \u0394KEEL overexpression, while ERp29 KDEL did not elicit any significant effect. As already observed with wt and C157S ERp29 overexpression, \u03b2-ENaC expression at the apical surface was not changed with overexpression of ERp29 KDEL or \u0394KEEL. In contrast, both ERp29 KDEL and \u0394KEEL overexpression decreased CFTR functional expression. That ERp29 \u0394KEEL inhibited both ENaC and CFTR functional expression suggested a role for the KDEL receptor in ENaC and CFTR biogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, our preliminary data suggest that siRNA-mediated depletion of Sec24D decreases the processing and cleavage of ENaC in the Golgi during biogenesis, as well as CFTR functional expression. Together our findings suggest a key regulatory role for ERp29's association with the KDEL receptor in the biogenesis of ENaC and CFTR.",

            "text": "Supported by grants from the CFF. Traditional methods for primary culture of human airway epithelial cells rarely allowed more than 1-2 passages before significant loss of epithelial function. Recently developed approaches including irradiated fibroblast feeder layers and inclusion of rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor enable >6 passages (10 5 -to 10 6 -fold expansion of cell number) with good retention of epithelial function. The \"gold standard\" for in vitro testing of CFTR correctors and potentiators is well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells obtained from lungs transplanted from CF patients. The number of different patient samples obtained in this manner is small and the range of CFTR mutations available for study is limited. The goal of this work is to establish methods for collection, culture, and expansion of primary human nasal epithelial cells, derived from non-CF volunteers to examine intersubject variation in CFTR expression and function. Nasal brushings were obtained from 16 healthy, non-CF volunteers. Nasal cells were collected a second time (>2 months later) from 4 of the subjects. All twenty samples were expanded (to passage 2) and cryopreserved. For analysis of CFTR function and expression, cells from multiple passages were seeded onto filter supports for establishment of air/liquid interface culture. The epithelial monolayers were transferred to Ussing chambers 15-60 days after seeding, bathed with symmetrical Krebs bicarbonate ringers solution, and maintained under short-circuit conditions. Amiloride, forskolin, and inh172 were added sequentially to inhibit sodium absorption, stimulate CFTR-dependent Clsecretion, and to inhibit CFTR-dependent Clsecretion, respectively. Viable epithelial cell cultures were established from all 20 subject samples. All of the cultures seeded onto filter supports for air/liquid interface culture developed high transepithelial resistance and the mean amiloride-sensitive sodium current for 16 subjects was 83.1 \u00b1 14.0 \u03bcA/cm 2 with a range of 3 -159 \u03bcA/cm 2 . Forskokin-stimulated and inh172-inhibited current was readily observed in all non-CF monolayers. The mean Clsecretory response (I 172 -sensitive current) for individual subjects was 12.1 \u00b1 4 \u03bcA/cm 2 with a range of 5.7 -26.0 \u03bcA/cm 2 . The ion transport properties of cells obtained from multiple brushings of a subject were qualitatively and quantitatively similar. CFTR mRNA expression across 16 subjects varied by ~10-fold and was correlated to CFTR Clcurrent. Epithelial cells obtained by nasal brushing of non-CF volunteers are readily isolated, cultured, expanded, and cryopreserved. The isolated nasal epithelial cells can be expanded rapidly to produce >1 billion cells (>2,000 filters) within 3-4 weeks. We have previously shown that primary cultures of CF patient-derived nasal epithelial cells are a sensitive system for testing CFTR function and for evaluating small molecule CFTR-directed therapeutics. The current data identify a target level for CFTR function in non-CF subjects and demonstrate a wide range of normal CFTR expression and function that might also contribute to individual patient drug response variation among CF subjects.

Lastly, in triple combinations with PTI amplifier and PTI corrector, the chronic ivacaftor-mediated destabilization of F508del-CFTR is prevented. In Ussing chamber assays, the PTI potentiator shows comparable efficacy with ivacaftor. In HBE electrophysiology measurements, the amplifier, PTI corrector and PTI potentiator triple combination restores the activity of mutant F508del-CFTR protein to near-normal CFTR activity. In addition, the amplifier-based triple combination provides potential advantages through its ability to modulate non-F508del CFTR and by overcoming substrate limitations for correctors and potentiators.

CF Translational Research Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; 3. Verona Pharma plc, London, United Kingdom; 4. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA The human cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes encoded by 11 gene families (PDE1-PDE11), most of which contain several genes (eg, PDE4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D) , each with multiple splice variants. They degrade cyclic nucleotides and it has been shown that inhibiting certain PDEs can elevate intracellular cAMP levels ([cAMP] i ) and stimulate CFTR-dependent anion secretion by human airway epithelia, suggesting PDE inhibitors as a potential treatment option for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Previous studies have focussed on the roles of PDE3, 4 and 5 in regulating CFTR activity and little is known regarding the importance of other PDE isoforms. Recently, we demonstrated that primary human bronchial epithelia (pHBE) express PDE8A mRNA at levels which are similar to those of PDE4D mRNA. We therefore examined whether PDE8 is involved in cAMP-dependent stimulation of CFTR by using a recently-described PDE8-selective inhibitor, Pfizer) . CFBE cells overexpressing wild type CFTR (CFBEwt) and pHBE cells from healthy subjects (pHBE WT) were grown as polarized monolayers and allowed to differentiate at the air-liquid interface (ALI) prior to study. Although adding the PDE8 inhibitor alone did not elevate [cAMP] i as measured using ELISA, a significant effect of the PDE8 inhibitor on [cAMP] i was observed during PDE4 inhibition and submaximal forskolin stimulation, indicating that PDE8 does contribute to cAMP metabolism in pHBE WT and CFBEwt cells. Furthermore, measurements of short-circuit current (I sc ) in CFBEwt cells mounted in Ussing chambers revealed that PDE8 inhibition increased CFTR-dependent I sc by 2.52 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcA cm -2 (p<0.01 vs DMSO; n=7), which is a small response compared to those produced by the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (36.77 \u00b1 6.58 \u03bcA cm -2 ; n=4) or dual PDE3/4 inhibitor RPL554 (49.82 \u00b1 7.82 \u03bcA cm -2 ; n=4). Nevertheless, PF increased I sc by 1.71 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcA cm -2 (p<0.01 vs DMSO; n=18) in pHBE WT cells, which was comparable to the stimulations by rolipram (4.16 \u00b1 2.51 \u03bcA cm -2 ; n=3), and RPL554 (3.37 \u00b1 0.40 \u03bcA cm -2 ; n=7) in primary cells, and greater than those observed using the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone or PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil. Moreover, PDE8 inhibition enhanced the I sc response to rolipram and RPL554 by ~3 fold and PDE4 inhibition increased the response to PF by ~6 fold, indicating that PDE4 and PDE8 inhibitors act synergistically on CFTR-dependent secretion. Finally, we assessed the effect of inhibiting PDE8 in pHBE cells from CF patients with the R117H/F508del genotype. The PDE8 inhibitor did not stimulate I sc when added alone, however it enhanced I sc when these CF primary cells were pretreated with a submaximal concentration of forskolin. In summary, our data suggest PDE8 as a novel regulator of CFTR in wild-type and CF human airway epithelia. It has a more prominent role than PDE3 and PDE5 and inhibitors of PDE8 and PDE4 act synergistically, thus PDE8 may represent a novel therapeutic target in CF.",

Chemistry, Bar Ilan University, Israel While the majority of cystic fibrosis patients have at least one copy of the F508del allele, a significant number of CF patients are compound heterozygotes and/or harbour two non-F508del alleles that affect protein folding, trafficking and function. Of the ~2000 sequence variants identified in CFTR to date, few have been rigorously evaluted for their effects on protein structure and function. Using the available CF/CFTR and human ABC-transporter mutation databases, we have identified and profiled a series of variants in the cytosolic domains of CFTR for their effects on CFTR protein folding and structure. By evaluating these mutation sets within the NBDs, these studies are designed (1) to inform our understanding of CFTR biosynthesis, (2) to identify the impact of reported sequence variations, and (3) to provide an experimental dataset for the development of more predictive models of CFTR mutations and their responses to treatment.",

This scoring system ranks mutations based on the conservation of native ABC-transporter sequences and their reported variants to provide additional confidence in the identification of rare disease-associated alleles. Optimization of this method prioritizes > 80% of CF-causing CFTR2 alleles with highest confidence. Applying this computional strategy to the CFTR1 mutation database, we have identified roughly 60 missense mutations of interest in NBD1 and 35 in NBD2 for subsequent studies. This expands the CFTR2 NBD mutation sets by roughly 5-fold and allows for a more comprehensive mutation-driven analysis of NBD folding and structure and CFTR biogenesis. Using these datasets, we have generated mutation libraries to systematically study the folding and stability of the NBDs in vitro, the effects of mutations on their structure, and the folding and trafficking of full-length CFTR in cell culture. Using a combination of purified NBD protein and novel in-cell assays, we have assessed the stability of the wildtype and mutant NBD proteins and the effects of mutation on the folding and structure of the NBDs in isolation. In parallel, cell culture studies evaluated the effects of these mutations on full-length CFTR folding and trafficking. Mutations within both NBD1 and NBD2 provide comprehensive support for the hierarchical folding and assembly of CFTR domains; mutations may influence either or both the folding and structure of the NBDs locally or their assembly within the global quaternary complex of CFTR. Correction of these defects, either by known and novel second-site suppressors and small molecules, further stratifies these datasets. Using these data, we have developed computational approaches to further explore the relationships between mutations and their effects on CFTR structure and function using clustering and network analyses. These studies provide additional insight into the biosynthetic pathway of wild-type CFTR and inform our understanding of the molecular pathologies of a large number of rare CF mutations.",

            "text": "CFTR class I and II mutations comprise a cohort of disease-associated alleles that have proven difficult to address by current therapeutic strategies. We previously described a novel approach (genome-wide yeast phenomics) to identify modifiers that rescue class II abnormalities, and high-throughput analysis revealed ribosomal protein L12 (Rpl12) as a primary target for this purpose. Rpl12 binds the 28S rRNA to form the P stalk base in the 60S subunit GTPase-associated center. The stalk interacts with many eukaryotic elongation factors (eEFs) during translation, including Rpl12 with eEF2. Our findings demonstrate siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rpl12 partially corrects functional expression of F508del CFTR and is additive or synergistic with VX-809 (lumacaftor TM ) in multiple cell models, including primary HBE codes homozygous for F508del. We next investigated mechanism(s) that underlie CFTR rescue in this setting by testing F508del second-site suppressors. In studies of HRP-tagged F508del CFTR stably expressed in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells, Rpl12 inhibition displayed no additivity with R555K, a mutation that improves stability of nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1). In contrast, R1070W, which restores the NBD1-intracellular loop 4 interface, conferred significant increase in plasma membrane-localized F508del following Rpl12 knockdown, a finding which suggests NBD1 stabilization. Inside-out patch clamp analyses were utilized to investigate the folding integrity of rescued F508del protein, and preliminary results show that Rpl12 inhibition produces a thermostable F508del channel, compatible with pro-folding effects on mutant CFTR. Based on these observations, we tested whether additional class II defects might also be rescued, including G85E, A455E and N1303K. Rpl12 knockdown resulted in 2-3 fold increase of mature, fully-glycosylated CFTR (C-band) and improved vectoral ion transport for all three CFTR mutants, as quantified by Western analysis and short circuit current, respectively. We have suggested previously that Rpl12 suppression inhibits interaction with eEF2 to slow translation, allowing the ribosome and auxiliary proteins to achieve a more native CFTR conformation. Because other P stalk components known to assemble onto Rpl12 interact with eEF1a, the factor responsible for enzymatic delivery of aminoacylated tRNAs to the ribosome, we investigated whether Rpl12 knockdown might induce incorporation of noncognate amino acids. We show Rpl12 inhibition of G542X-and W1282X-CFTR promotes increases in full-length protein expression. Taken together, this work provides the first evidence that Rpl12 represents a novel therapeutic strategy for rescue of numerous CFTR class I and II defects. Refinement of the approach will establish the importance of ribosomal proteins during CFTR folding, and furnish new molecular targets for experimental treatment of the disease.

Moreover, using a duolink assay, we observed that the 3 lectins interact with F508del-CFTR. Next, we transfected cells with EDEM1, EDEM2 or EDEM3 specific siRNA and observed that the decrease of their expression was correlated to a decrease of their interaction with F508del-CFTR. Interestingly, we showed using iodide efflux technique a restoration of a CFTR activity in cells transfected with EDEM1 or EDEM2 siRNA but not in EDEM3 siRNA transfected cells. From these results, we investigated the effect of inhibitors of ERManI on EDEMs/F508del-CFTR interaction and on F508del-CFTR activity and revealed a corrector effect of kifunensine, swainsonine, deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) and its N-butyl analogue N-BU DMJ. Therefore, we adapted a \"click chemistry\" methodology to synthesize more efficient F508del-CFTR correctors based on DMJ clusters. From screening, we observed that the trivalent-DMJ presented the best efficiency with an EC 50 of 0.8 \u03bcM. Next, we demonstrated that the trivalent-DMJ decreases by 30% the interaction of F508del-CFTR/EDEM1 or EDEM2 and by 14% with EDEM3. No effect was observed on the interaction with calnexin, HSP70 or HSP90, suggesting an EDEM-dependent mechanism of action. In parallel of these results, we confirmed the corrector effect of our corrector on human polarized bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE) using the Ussing chamber technique with a restoration of an Isc current of 20 \u03bcA/cm 2 . More interestingly, we confirmed its corrector effect on human respiratory epithelial cells freshly isolated from CF patients using the fluorescent probe oxonol.",

We identified that inhibiting ERManI corrects the trafficking defect of F508del-CFTR with an EDEM-dependent mechanism of action and we propose a new series of water-soluble and non-toxic correctors. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). A critical issue in CF is the inability of the most common CFTR mutation, deletion of the phenylalanine residue at position 508 (F508del CFTR), to achieve the native, folded state required for its export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic to the epithelial cell apical membrane. Instead, F508del CFTR protein is exclusively retained in the ER and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a process refered to as ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). However, F508del CFTR mobilized to the plasma membrane retains substantial CFTR Clchannel function; therefore, understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate F508del CFTR degradation during its early biogenesis is a critical step to achieve effective and selective mobilization of the mutant CFTR from the ER.",

            "text": "Previously, our lab demonstrated that Derlin-1 promotes the efficient degradation of CFTR folding mutants including F508del CFTR. Here we report that VCP-interacting membrane protein (VIMP) is an ERAD component playing an important role in degrading the misfolded CFTR. Over-expression of VIMP reduced the steady-state levels of WT and F508del CFTR by 70% and 95%, respectively. In cycloheximide chase experiments, VIMP expression resulted in a shorter half life of F508del CFTR from 40 min to 20 min. Conversely, silencing of endogenous VIMP increased F508del CFTR expression by more than 5-fold in human airway epithelial cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunostaining revealed that VIMP interacts with F508del CFTR and co-localizes with the mutant protein in the ER region of airway epithelial cells. Since Derlin-1 has been reported as a key regulator of CFTR degradation, we asked whether VIMP plays any role in Derlin-1 mediated CFTR degradation. Double silence experiment was performed. Compared with silence of Derlin-1 only, the double silence of Derlin-1 and VIMP did not lead to further increase in F508del CFTR expression, suggesting that VIMP and Derlin-1 utilize the same pathway for the CFTR degradation. It has been shown that ubiquitin E3 ligases, RNF5 and CHIP, degrade F508delCFTR. To investigate if VIMP is associated with a specific ubiquitin E3 ligase we performed co-immunoprecipitation and found VIMP interacts with RNF5, but not CHIP in CFBE-41o-\u0394F cells. Overexpression of both VIMP and RNF5 virtually eliminated F508del CFTR expression and VIMP-mediated mutant CFTR degradation was abolished by RNF5 dominate negative, indicating VIMP recruits RNF5 to degrade the mutant protein. In CFBE-41o-\u0394F cells, silencing VIMP expression increased VX-809-mediated F508delCFTR maturation and its function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that VIMP recruits RNF5 to degrade misfolded F508del CFTR. Downregulation of VIMP enhancing the ability of VX-809 to rescue F508delCFTR provides a novel therapeutic strategy to synergistically restore the mutant protein function.",

As a substrate for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), the mechanisms of misfolding and disposal of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) remain incompletely understood. Steps in ERAD usually include the recognition, ubiquitin modification and proteasomal proteolysis of misfolded proteins. Due to its complex and protracted folding and domain assembly requirements, much of WT CFTR and ~100% of the common folding mutant, F508del CFTR, are degraded in most expression systems. Protein ubiquitylation is controlled by the opposing activities of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylating enzymes.

(1) We used protein-binding arrays to screen for protein interactions with mono-SUMO-1 or poly-SU-MO-2/3 chains, to identify targets for SUMO-mediated regulation of CFTR biogenesis/degradation. In protein-binding arrays, several deubiquitylating enzymes were identified, an example is USP28. Another ubiquitin-specific protease, USP11, has recently been reported to be capable of deubiquitylating SUMO-2/3-poly-chains that had been ubiquitylated by the SUMOchain targeted ubiquitin ligase, RNF4, thus counteracting the action of RNF4 in the DNA damage response. (2) To understand the roles of USP11 and USP28 in regulating CFTR biogenesis and degradation, we determined whether these proteins function similarly, to stabilize SUMO-modified CFTR via deubiquitylation. Indeed, the overexpression of either USP11 or USP28 elevated the levels of CFTR expression in both CFBE cells and HEK293 cells. In addition, USP11 also markedly reduced the ubiquitylation of F508del CFTR, whereas catalytically inactive mutant USP11 (C318A) eliminated its ability to augment CFTR expression. Our results also revealed that the USP28-induced CFTR expression increase occurred through USP28-induced reduction in SUMO-2/3 modification of F508del CFTR, which reduces RNF4 targeting to CFTR at the substrate level. These results suggest that these members of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, USP11 and USP28, can rescue SUMO-2/3 modified mutant CFTR from degradation via deubiquitylation, and may do so via different mechanisms.",

Introduction: Restoring F508del CFTR function through modulator treatment has demonstrated clinical efficacy in CF patients homozygous for F508del CFTR, though less than that with ivacaftor in CF patients with gating mutations. Identifying factors limiting response to CFTR modulators is a pressing need, such as reports of potential negative interactions between VX-770 and VX-809 on F508del CFTR in vitro (Veit G, et al. Sci Transl Med. 2014; 6:246ra97) . In the TRAFFIC/TRANSPORT trials, a minority of patients not receiving \u03b2-agonists (n=54) demonstrated increased effects of Orkambi on FEV 1 (Wainright CE, et al. NEJM. 2015; 373:220-31) . We have demonstrated that chronic exposure of wt-and F508del CFTR human lower airway epithelial cells (LAECs) with the short-acting \u03b2-agonist (SABA) albuterol was sufficient to reduce subsequent CFTR activation by 30-70%.",

Increasing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized pool of mutant CFTR available for pharmacologic correction could offer substantial benefits to compound-heterozygous individuals carrying only one copy of F508del. Misfolded F508del CFTR undergoes premature degradation initiated by ubiquitination, followed by targeting to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery and proteasome. E3 ubiquitin ligases such as gp78 play an important role during the routing of CFTR to degradation, and novel compounds that block CFTR ubiquitination could augment the mutant protein pool acted upon by small molecule correctors. Using the Ubipro TM discovery platform, we conducted a primary FRET-based screen of a library containing >220,000 small molecules, and isolated compounds that attenuate ubiquitination catalyzed by gp78. A total of 334 specific gp78 inhibitors were then selected and verified for blockade of recombinant human CFTR NBD2 ubiquitination, and prioritized by their ability to promote surface expression of F508del CFTR-HRP in epithelial cell models. Nineteen compounds were next evaluated for effects on F508del CFTR Band B accumulation and rescue by lumacaftor. Two of these, termed P80142 and P80152, increased F508del CFTR in both HEK293 and FRT cells, and synergistically enhanced chloride transport when combined with lumacaftor. P80142 also increased steady-state levels of other mutant CFTRs such as W1282X (class I defect) and E92K (class II), with synergistic rescue again observed following lumacaftor. These results indicate that inhibition of a specific ubiquitin E3 ligase can augment the reparable pool of F508del CFTR, and point to a novel drug-development strategy. In addition, demonstration that a gp78 modulator improves F508del, W1282X, and E92K stability indicates a shared degradative pathway that could be targeted to enhance correction among patients carrying these alleles. The compounds described are currently being evaluated in primary airway epithelial cells as experimental therapeutics for a broad spectrum of individuals with cystic fibrosis. (Funded by NIH and CFF.) shift changes upon VX-809 binding provides evidence of allosteric coupling between the direct binding site and the NBD1:CL4 interface, which is tightly linked to the NBD dimerization surface.

Mol Biol Cell. 2013; 24:3016-24) this additional mode of VX-809 binding provides insight into conformational dynamics and allostery within CFTR. We interpret these data to propose that the action of VX-809 on NBD1 and the subsequent destabilization of helices H8 and H9 contributes to the mechanism of action by allosterically stabilizing NBD1:CL4 interactions and releasing RE/R region from the core of NBD1, thereby promoting NBD dimerization and stabilizing full-length CFTR.

We have demonstrated improvement of CFTR function in cells harboring G542X and R553X mutations. Formulations for the delivery of the modified tRNA by nanoparticles were developed by screening a small library of nanoparticles with unique functional groups capable of RNA delivery using a cell line containing an endogenous nonsense mutation. Off-target effects of the modified tRNAs on natural stop codons were experimentally assessed. Positive formulations were assessed in primary HBEs derived from CF patient explants that harbor nonsense mutations in CFTR. The data suggest that nanoparticle delivery of modified tRNA can improve CFTR function in primary HBEs and may offer an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of CF caused by nonsense mutations. Despite a critical role in CFTR processing and gating, direct detection of nucleotide binding domain (NBD) heterodimerization remains elusive. Channel gating studies indicate that the channel rapidly cycles between open and closed conformations, suggesting that the NBD dimers form with a very modest affinity. Dimerization of the isolated NBDs is likely further compromised by disruption of critical interactions between the intracellular loops (ICLs) and the Q-loops of the NBDs. We have previously shown that the Q-loop of the isolated NBD1 domain exchanges between dimer-favorable and dimer-unfavorable positions and that deletion of F508 (F508del) pushes the Q-loop to the dimer-incompatible position (Chong PA, et al. J Biol Chem. 2015; 290:22862-78) . Similarly, in the isolated NBD2 the sidechain of the eponymous Q-loop glutamine, Q1291, flips roughly 180 degrees to hydrogen bond with S1359 (Zhao X, et al. Ped Pulmonol. 2008; 43(S31):205) . This rotates the alpha-helical subdomain out of a dimer-compatible position. Mutation of S1359 to disrupt this hydrogen bond allows the alpha-helical subdomain to move partway back to a dimer-compatible position. While both of these Q-loop problems may be mitigated by interactions with the ICLs, they nonetheless probably contribute energetically to the modest affinity of the NBD dimers in fulllength CFTR. We are using computational and bioinformatics tools to predict mutations that will stabilize the NBDs and NBD1-NBD2 dimers with the dual goal of understanding impediments to NBD heterodimerization in WT and F508del CFTR and obtaining stable NBD dimers for biophysical studies. We have successfully stabilized NBD2 for biophysical studies, including CD and NMR studies. NBD heterodimerization will be assayed using thermal melt assays, NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments and NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), techniques that we have successfully used to confirm NBD1 homodimerization. We will probe the effects of disease-causing mutations, the C-terminal tail of CFTR, the regulatory insertion and the R region (both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated) on NBD heterodimers. We will provide a progress update on these experiments. This work will also enable studies of small molecule modulators targeted at the NBD dimer interface.

Elp2 is a scaffold protein required for activation of STAT3; Elp2 is also a component of the Elongator complex that appears to regulate a number of cellular processes including RNA polymerase II activity. As other data suggest that increased Hsp70 expression promotes F508del trafficking (2) , we hypothesized that increased Elp2 expression will promote F508del trafficking to the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we performed Ussing chamber experiments in CFBE41o-F508del cells that overexpressed Elp2, or CFBE41o-wt CFTR cells that were transfected with Elp2 specific siRNA. Overexpression of Elp2 increased CFTR-mediated currents in CFBE41o-F508del cells, whereas depletion of Elp2 by siRNA in CFBE410-wt CFTR cells decreased CFTR-mediated currents. Previously, we have shown that increased Hsp70 expression promotes interaction of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with the Sec24D cargo recognition component of coat complex II (COP II) machinery, which carries protein cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments in IB3-1 CF bronchiolar epithelial cells, overexpression of Elp2 increased Hsp70 expression and promoted the interaction of F508del-CFTR and Sec24D. These data provide a mechanistic link of increased Elp2 expression leading to increased Hsp70 expression and, as a result, improved F508del trafficking.",

Elp2 does not itself have a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and therefore likely needs a \"carrier\" to move to the nucleus. We initially hypothesized that STAT3 and more specifically activated phospho-STAT3, serves as the Elp2 \"carrier,\" as we previously demonstrated that STAT3 translocated to the nucleus after 4PBA treatment (1) . We tested this hypothesis using luciferase reporter assays in IB3-1 cells, where luciferase expression was controlled by the human Hsp70 promoter. However, overexpression of STAT3 and mutant STAT3 constructs, including a constitutively active STAT3 (STAT-3C), and STAT3 tyrosine or serine phosphorylation-deficient mutants (STAT3-Y705F and STAT3-S727A) suggested that the phosphorylation state of STAT3 does not regulate Elp2 translocation to the nucleus and Hsp70 expression in response to 4PBA. Instead overexpression of other elongator complex proteins, namely Elp1 and Elp3, in similar luciferease reporter assays suggested that Elp3, which contains a NLS, may carry Elp2 into the nucleus in response to 4PBA. Together these data suggest a mechanism by which 4PBA can improve F508del trafficking, and potentially identify new targets for intervention.",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic lethal genetic disease, which is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Previously, we constructed a variant of nucleotide-binding domain 1 (hNBD1) from human CFTR that maintains native-like stability when a visible fluorophore is covalently bound at a single labeling site, and fluorescence self-quenching (FSQ) of this labeled domain upon unfolding/aggregation provides a robust and accurate high-throughput assay for compounds that offset the temperaturedepending folding defect in both isolated F508del-hNBD1 and full-length human F508del-CFTR. Using this FSQ assay, we demonstrated that hNBD1 binds several common nucleotide analogs ~3-fold tighter than ATP --the physiological ligand of hNBD1. We demonstrated that these analogs preserve the gating function of F508del-hCFTR channels even at 37\u00b0 C while ATP cannot. We have extended this approach to establish an equivalent FSQ assay for compounds that stabilize the hNBD1-hNBD2 in interface in human CFTR. This assay exploits a recent breakthrough that produced a monodisperse and stable construct of nucleotide-binding domain 2 (hNBD2) from human CFTR. We covalently linked this hNBD2 construct to the hNBD1 construct used in FSQ assay via an 80-residue-long inter-NBD linker from EttA (Energy-dependent translation throttle A) (1, 2) , a bacterial protein with two tandem NBDs. Biophysical and structural studies have shown this linker motif from EttA is compatible with functional ATP-mediated heterodimerization of its tandem NBDs, which are homologous to those in CFTR. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) shows that hNBD1 and hNBD2 unfold independently in the resulting hNBD1-(EttA-linker)-hNBD2 fusion protein construct, which is monodisperse at high concentration after purification. We will use the FSQ assay in this construct to screen for compounds that promote tight nucleotide-dependent thermodynamic interaction between hNBD1 and hNBD2. Such compounds would facilitate high-resolution structural studies of the functional hNBD1-hNBD2 interface in human CFTR, which stabilizes the open state of active CFTR channels. Based on the results described above for nucleotide analogs stabilizing isolated hNBD1, such compounds stabilizing the hNBD1-hNBD2 interface could also potentially represent lead compounds for drugs correcting the temperature-sensitive folding defect in full-length human F508del-CFTR.",

Biochem J. 2009; 425:245-55) . In the present study, we examined the interaction of Hsp27 with BAG3, since it is possible that Hsp27 interacts with BAG3 similarly to other sHsps. We previously showed that Hsp27 initiates the degradation of F508del CFTR by promoting modification of the mutant by SUMO-2/3 (Ahner A, et al. Mol Biol Cell. 2013; 24:74-84) . We show here that overexpressed Hsp22 also reduces the CFTR band B. In view of the recognized interaction of Hsp22 with the BAG3-mediated degradation pathways, it was of interest to evaluate similarities/differences between these pathways for sHsp-mediated degradation. We demonstrated the selective recognition of CFTR band B by BAG3 in direct protein-protein interaction studies, and a BAG3 point mutation, R480A, which blocks its interaction with HSP70, also abolishes BAG3's interaction with immature CFTR. These findings suggest that BAG3 recognition of CFTR requires the cooperation of HSP70. The involvement of the aggresome marker, LC3, in this pathway provided further evidence for selective targeting of BAG3 towards aggresomal structures: aggregates of CFTR were found to be co-localized with LC3 positive compartments in COS7 cells and LC3 was also co-precipitated with CFTR in immunoprecipitation assays. Altogether, these data suggest that the selective disposal of misfolded CFTR can be mediated by aggresome-lysosomal degradation, assisted by chaperonemediated autophagy, and for CFTR, they identify a role for sHsps in cooperating with BAG3 in this process.

            "text": "The most prevalent CF-causing mutation, F508del, impairs not only the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) folding but also interdomain assembly of CFTR, resulting in defective trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane in cells. The Phe508 residue lies at an interface of NBD1 and the intracellular cytoplasmic loop 4 (ICL4) in transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2). A recent NMR study indicated that the ICL4 interaction induces an allosterically coupled conformational change in NBD1 at the region of Phe508 and the C-terminal region including beta-stands S9/10 and helices H8/9. Interestingly, S9/10 and H8/9 are located distal to Phe508 in the NBD1 structure, and are critical for CFTR processing and channel activity. Histidine at residue 620 (His620) in S9 is well conserved across species. In human CFTR, amino acid substitution at His620 has been reported for four missense variants, H620Q, H620P, H620L, and H620R. When exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells, three of these, H620P, H620L, and H620R disrupted CFTR maturation. In contrast, H620Q CFTR was properly processed with a similar level of maturation as wild-type CFTR. All four His620 variants in cis with F508del failed to mature. Thus, H620Q is neither a processing defect mutation nor a second-site suppressor. In contrast, H620Q blocked the ability of a small-molecule corrector C18 (a VX-809 analog) to rescue F508del CFTR. Because a mutation R1070W in ICL4 perturbs the NBD1-ICL4 contact without any direct alteration of NBD1 folding, we examined its effect on CFTR biogenesis in cis with H620Q. H620Q/ R1070W CFTR further decreased a level of maturation and C18 response compared to that of R1070W CFTR. These results imply that H620Q exerts a mild folding defect on NBD1, which aggravates the biosynthetic defects of F508del CFTR. Enhancement of NBD1 folding by deletion of RI (RIdel) or restoration of NBD1-ICL4 contact by introduction of a second-site suppressor R1070W partially rescued F508del/H620Q CFTR, but H620Q still lowered the level of C18-rescue compared to F508del CFTR. Our results indicate that allosteric folding effects of the NBD1 C-terminal region play a role in C18-mediated correction of F508del CFTR. C18 response to the allosteric folding defects of F508del CFTR can be partially restored by combination of the two separate folding mechanisms -improvement of NBD1 folding and facilitation of NBD1-TMD2 interdomain assembly.

Due to the reported in vitro destabilization of CFTR protein by chronic exposure to certain potentiators, chronic dosing conditions were employed in the phenotypic screen to discover potentiator-like molecules that lack this destabilization effect. To enrich for compounds that confer potentiator activity, forskolin-mediated activation of the F508del-CFTR was performed without the acute addition of potentiator molecules. Under this paradigm, several distinct chemical series of novel CFTR modulators were discovered.",

Objectives: It is generally recognized that both wild-type and F508del CFTR proteins undergo posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination and sumoylation at multiple lysines in the protein and in one or more subcellular locations. Previously our group showed that ubiquitination of lysine residues in wild-type CFTR regulates its stability and subcellular localization. Here, we hypothesize that compared to wild-type CFTR, lysine residues in F508del CFTR are differentially modified during posttranslational modification and interference with posttranslational modification of lysine residues in F508del CFTR stabilizes the protein and regulates subcellular localization.",

University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA; Israel; 3. Texas Tech Univ Health Sciences Ctr, Lubbock, TX, USA; 4. UNC at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Several second-site mutations in NBD1, alone or in combinations, thermally stabilize the isolated NBD1 and promote maturation and trafficking of full-length (FL) F508del-CFTR (He, et al. J Mol Biol. 2015; 16:106-20) . Importantly, their corrective effect was also shown to positively correlate with the extent of NBD1 thermal stabilization. The latter observation enables NBD1 stabilization to predict F508del-CFTR correction. A subset of these mutations was also shown to increase exogenous expression levels of WT CFTR, as well as the purification yield and thermostability of reconstituted channel activity (Aleksandrov, et al. Protein Expr Purif. 2015; 116:159-66) . The immediate goal of the present study was to extend the previous work to identify additional NBD1 mutations that maximally stabilize the isolated domain when combined; some of these, like M470V, are newly reported NBD1 stabilizers. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the unfolding temperatures (T m ) of 14 single stabilizing mutants in NBD1 (aa 387-646, \u0394405-436) were determined. Various combinations of two, three or more were also introduced into NBD1 for T m determination. More than 20 such NBD1 mutants were studied and it was found that the stabilizing effect was generally additive; exceptions were noted and will be presented. The largest stabilizing effect was observed with a combination of 6 top-ranked single mutations, which increased the NBD1 T m by close to 30 o C over WT NBD1 (aa 387-646). A smaller subset was also introduced into the F508del-NBD1 and some differences in the extent of stabilization were found. To correlate T m -shifts with structural parameters, and ultimately predict T m -shifts of new mutations, the 14 single mutations were modeled into the existing NBD1 structure (PDB ID: 2PZE) of the NBD1 construct studied here. Changes in solvent-accessible surface area were calculated, and the free energy of stabilization (\u0394\u0394G) was computed using several different \u0394\u0394G prediction algorithms. Favorable qualitative and quantitative correlations between the predicted \u0394\u0394G and the actual T m -shifts were found, setting the basis for predicting the effect of future mutations on NBD1 stability. Such predictions could be potentially extended to fulllength CFTR. Selected combo-mutations were introduced in human WT FL CFTR, expressed in mammalian cells, purified and their unfolding temperatures determined. A positive correlation between NBD1 T m and CFTR T m was observed and results will be shown. A detailed analysis of the thermal unfolding will be presented in another poster (Urbatsch et al.) .

We tested the hypothesis, using cells stably expressing common disease-causing mutants, A1038V, R1108C (previously published) and R1129C in NBD1 and G1961E in NBD2, that correctors that rescue \u0394F508-CFTR (ABCC7) also rescue abca4 mutations because of the high degree of homology between their NBDs. was applied (10 and 20 \u03bcM) for 16h in HEK293 stably expressing the mutants. R1108C and R1129C express 60% less protein than wt ABCA4. Large increases in mutant protein levels occurred in cells grown at 27 o C demonstrating that both mutants just like many CFTR trafficking mutants are temperature sensitive. When translation was inhibited, mutant proteins rapidly disappeared, whereas wt-ABCA4 remained stable. The data indicate that these mutant ABCA4 proteins are unstable and rapidly degraded similar to \u0394F508-CFTR. The corrector VX-809 increased total protein and cell surface expression of R1108C and R1129C by 1.5 and 2 fold, respectively. In contrast the effect of VX-809 on A1038V and G1961E was greater increasing the steady-state protein levels by between 2 and 3 fold with the greatest response noted with A1038V. Following treatment with VX-809 both mutants can now be observed at the plasma membrane as assessed by surface biotinylation suggesting that trafficking to the plasma membrane is restored. Interestingly, VX-809, considered to be a class 1 corrector, was effective in increasing the steady-state protein levels of ABCA4 mutants whereas the combination of class 1 and 2 was not additive compared to VX-809 alone. This is in contrast to \u0394F508-CFTR where combination of Class 1 and 2 correctors is most effective. Our studies show that Hsp 27 and 40 are important for the rescue of \u0394F508-CFTR but not the ABCA4 mutants where VX-809 may rescue the mutant protein by a direct effect on the folding.",

Department of Physiology, Johns Hopkins U, Baltimore, MD, USA In CF, approximately 90% of the patients have at least one copy of the F508del mutation and over 70% are homozygous for this mutation. Severe CF is also caused by class I mutations including premature stop codon mutations, which are found on 5-10% of CF chromosomes. Thus, to achieve the goal of treating everyone, therapies have to be developed to restore function to patients with early stop codons.

Both cell lines display small steady-state amounts of truncated, R1162X and W1282X proteins. Surprisingly, when treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, steady-state levels of R1162X and W1282X increase by 20-and 6-fold respectively. Smaller but significant increases were noted when HDAC6 was inhibited by tubacin. Application of a combination of small molecule correctors C4 + 18 increased steadystate levels of truncated protein of R1162X and W1282X between 2-3 fold. These data indicate that truncated protein is produced but rapidly degraded. The combination of C4+18 plus gentamicin (800 \u03bcg/mL for 24h) produced 5-and 10-fold increases in CFTR protein respectively. To determine whether the chloride transport function of R1162X-and W1282X CFTR can be restored, we performed short circuit current experiments. CFTR-dependent chloride currents increased approximately 2-fold for both mutants when treated with the combination of C4+18. The currents also increased about 2-fold for both mutants when treated with gentamicin. Treating cells with C4+18 plus gentamicin did not increase CFTR-generated currents in cells containing the R1162X mutation compared to each treatment alone. In contrast C4+18 plus gentamicin treatment did increase the CFTR-dependent currents in cells containing the W1282X mutant by 3-fold compared to 2-fold when each treatment was applied individually.",

Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA Background: Lung function decline in CF can be largely attributed to irreversible destruction of the muscle and elastic tissue of the airways, a process referred to as bronchiectasis. Reports clearly demonstrate that bronchiectasis develops in localized regions of the lung, and that these specific regions of bronchiectasis worsen over time. Recent reports demonstrate that bronchiectasis develops preferentially in the upper lobes of the lung, despite mucus plugging occurring more diffusely. We have previously shown that there is stability of the microbiome in different regions of the lung despite clear differences in regional lung damage. These findings suggest that local host factors promote lung damage, but the actual mechanism underlying regional heterogeneity of disease remains unclear Methods: Fifteen CF subjects underwent CT scan and bronchoscopy. A CT scan was obtained with calculation of lobar Brody scores. After local anesthesia, a bronchoscope was inserted transorally and passed through the vocal cords. Regional bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained from the lobes with the highest, lowest, and median Brody scores and primary alveolar macrophages (AMs) were isolated from each region. Regional inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA.",

University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA Background: Treatment outcomes in acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE) of cystic fibrosis (CF) are suboptimal, as 25% of treated subjects do not return to baseline pulmonary function following therapy. There is a growing appreciation that dysregulated T cell responses, specifically Th17 and Th2-skewed cytokine profiles, may contribute to pathogenic CF inflammation, but their role at the time of APE is incompletely understood. Effector memory CD4+ T cells are a useful model system of CF immune signatures because they are abundant in lung tissue, traffic to the peripheral circulation, and should manifest a recall program, in response to stimulation, which allows the host to efficiently clear pathogens. We hypothesized that, at the time of pulmonary exacerbations, differences in memory cell effector functions, including cytokine production and proliferation, would stratify subjects who exacerbate frequently (>2/year), versus those who require intravenous antibiotics infrequently (<1/year).",

We have characterized that CD4+ effector memory T cells in CF hosts with pulmonary exacerbations demonstrate an immunosuppressive phenotype, with evidence of T cell exhaustion, reduced proliferation, and reduced interferon gamma, suggestive of defective bacterial killing. Since these immunologic signatures are directly measurable from peripheral blood, they represent a potentially useful tool to stratifying patient responses at the time of exacerbation treatment, serving not only as a biomarker of host defense but also as a target for future immune modulation.",

Department of Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA Macrophages play a key role in clearing P. aeruginosa lung infections. In response to bacterial infection macrophages migrate into the lungs where they phagocytose and kill bacteria and release several cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1. However, in CF, macrophages exhibit a reduced ability to kill P. aeruginosa and manifest increased cytokine secretion compared to non-CF macrophages. Several reports have demonstrated that CFTR is expressed in macrophages and the bactericidal activity of macrophages is defective in CF. Moreover, inhibition of wt-CFTR by CFTRinh-172 reduces phagocytosis by macrophages. By contrast, VX-325 increases the export of F508del-CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane and F508del-CFTR-dependent Clcurrents in CF monocytes. We have shown that VX-325 increases the abundance of F508del-CFTR in immune cell phagolysosomes, which play an important role in bactericidal activity. Recent clinical trials with VX-809 + VX-770 (Orkambi) in CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation have demonstrated a small increase in FEV1 and a decrease in the rate of exacerbations. However there are no studies on the effect of VX-809 + VX-770 on the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine the ability of VX-809 + VX-770 to stimulate CF macrophages to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa and to reduce cytokine secretion. Stable subjects with CF (n = 5, F508del/F508del) donated blood and isolated monocytes were differentiated into macrophages (monocyte-derived macrophages, MDM) by incubation with M-CSF (100 ng/mL) for 7 days. VX-809 (3 \u03bcM) increased the phagocytic uptake of P. aeruginosa compared to vehicle-treated MDMs by 84%. Although the combination of VX-809 (3 \u03bcM) + VX-770 (5 \u03bcM) also increased the phagocytic uptake of P. aeruginosa, compared to vehicle-treated MDMs, the increase was 36%, a value significantly less than with VX-809 alone. VX-809 alone increased the ability of MDMs to kill phagocytosed P. aeruginosa by 110% compared to vehicle-treated MDMs. VX-809 + VX-770 also increased the ability of MDMs to kill P. aeruginosa compared to vehicle-treated MDMs by 27%, a value less than the increase with VX-809 alone. Preliminary studies also revealed that VX-809 decreased P. aeruginosa-stimulated secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 by MDMs by 54%, 28%, 24%, 60%, and 32%, respectively. Moreover, the combination of VX-809 + VX-770 was more effective in decreasing P. aeruginosa-stimulated cytokine secretion by MDMs than VX-809 alone. VX-809 + VX-770 reduced P. aeruginosa-stimulated IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion by 60%, 99%, 67%, 99% and 97%, respectively. In conclusion, VX-809 increased the ability of CF MDMs to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa, while VX-770 reduced the efficacy of VX-809 to stimulate the ability of CF MDMs to phagocytose and kill P. aeruginosa. By contrast, VX-770 increased the ability of VX-809 to reduce P. aeruginosa-stimulated cytokine secretion by CF MDMs. Supported by the NIH (RO1-HL-074175 and P20-RR018787) and the CFF (STANTO15R0 and STANTO16G0 to BAS and ASHARE15A0 to AA).",

Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons Ireland, Dublin, Beaumont, Ireland; 2. Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9, Ireland Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited genetic condition resulting in a higher frequency of airway infections causing irreversible damage to the lung and eventual respiratory failure. Increasing evidence suggests that CF neutrophils possess an intrinsic and pathological inflammatory defect. Hydrogen voltage-gated channel 1 (HVCN-1) is a transmembrane proton channel that regulates pH changes across the cell membrane. In neutrophils, HVCN-1 is central to the sustained activity of the NADPH oxidase upon uptake of a pathogen. Murine HVCN-1 knockout studies have demonstrated an increased phagosomal pH, significantly higher primary granule degranulation and reduced killing by neutrophils. As CF neutrophils demonstrate increased primary granule degranulation we hypothesised that CF cells may have reduced abundance of HVCN-1. The aim of this work was to investigate whether HVCN-1 was altered on the surface of CF neutrophils resulting in altered pH and phagosomal killing.",

Div Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA Introduction: Chronic bacterial lung infections are a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease and are difficult to eradicate. Chronic lung infections result in chronic lung inflammation which creates a paradox where most anti-inflammatory therapies can suppress an already inadequate lung immune response. Recently we have reported that the lung's innate immune response can generate hypothiocyanite that can be selectively metabolized by the host's thioredoxin reductase (metazoan type) but not the pathogen's thioredoxin reductase (non-metazoan type). In fact, bacterial thioredoxin reductase is readily inhibited by hypothiocyanite. Thioredoxin reductase is a critical enzyme that supplies an essential cofactor, thioredoxin, for ribonucleotide reductase which converts RNA to DNA. The potential importance of this pathway in the CF lung is that thiocyanate, the substrate for hypothiocyanate formation, is a small anion that is transported by CFTR and is dysfunctional in CF.",

Studies were performed using dimedone labeling with Western blot analysis. Thioredoxin reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically following NADPH utilization. Bacterial viability was assessed using standard dilution methodology to determine colony forming units (CFUs) .

Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA; 2. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Bethesda, MD, USA; 3. Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Background: The cystic fibrosis (CF) lung is characterized by delayed mucociliary clearance (MCC), although the mechanisms are not well understood. Recently, our center has developed the first CFTR -/rat, which recapitulates some features highly relevant to CF lung disease. Importantly, rat airways express submucosal glands that develop over time, a feature that is distinct from murine models and more accurately represents human physiology. Delayed mucociliary transport develops as the rat ages, allowing for a detailed investigation into the mechanisms underlying abnormal mucus transport.",

By 6 months of age, CF rats express mature airway submucosal glands and exhibit spontaneous mucus plugging of enlarged airway submucosal glands in the large airways, accompanied by delayed MCT rates (0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm/min CF vs. 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 mm/min control, p<0.05) and hyperviscous mucus (74.15 cP CF vs 3.28 cP WT). Reduced pH and MCT rates in the older rats were secondary to deficient bicarbonate transport, and could be recapitulated in WT tracheae with bicarbonate-free buffers. Abnormal MCT was corrected in CF rat tracheae with addition of bicarbonate at increasing concentrations directly to the airway surface (peak effect 3.36 \u00b1 0.9 mm/min with 115mM NaHCO 3 , vs 0.09 \u00b1 0.02 mm/min baseline, p<0.001).

Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA Objectives: In cystic fibrosis (CF), initial respiratory infections are associated with subsequent development of bronchiectasis. Because mucus release from submucosal glands (SMG) is defective in CF pigs, bacterial attachment to SMG mucus could facilitate airway infection. Our aim was to visualize where CF pathogens bind in newborn pig tracheas to determine whether the site of binding influences subsequent clearance by mucociliary transport. We hypothesized that Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa preferentially bind SMG-derived mucus strands, and that bacterial clearance worsens in CF after stimulation of SMG secretion by methacholine (MCH) . Because mucus integrity depends on disulfide bonds, these strands may be targeted by reducing agents.",

Silurian Pharmaceuticals, Oakland, CA, USA; 3. Pediatrics, Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA, USA Introduction: A key pathophysiological endpoint of CFTR dysfunction is airway mucus stasis. This slowed mucus clearance becomes more problematic in CF exacerbations because of the additive effect of an increased airway load of free neutrophil elastase. To model these events we used aerosol challenge with CFTRinh-172 (CFTRinh) alone or in combination with aerosol human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and studied the effects of these challenges on whole lung mucociliary clearance (MCC) and its surrogate marker tracheal mucus velocity (TMV) in sheep. We showed that CFTRinh and CFTRinh+HNE slowed TMV for 12-24h and then showed that clinically used agents, eg, hypertonic saline or albuterol, failed to reverse this dysfunction (Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; 50(S41) :300). Here, we attempt to reverse the TMV impairment produced by aerosol challenge with CFTRinh or CFTRinh+HNE with aerosol ivacaftor and compared these results to those obtained with aerosol brevenal, a natural product produced by K. brevis.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Airway mucus is elevated in preschool children with CF and associated with inflammatory markers, changes in the airway milieu, and early structural lung disease. These findings appeared independent of airways infection and are most consistent with airway mucus dehydration as the initiating defect in human CF airways disease. Thus, airway dehydration remains a high value target for therapeutic intervention in the youngest children with CF. Several members of the SLC26A family of anion transporters associate with CFTR, forming complexes in which CFTR and SLC26A function are reciprocally regulated. This regulation involves interactions between the STAS domain of SLC26A members and the R domain of CFTR. In eukaryotes, the SLC26A STAS domain is composed of two highly conserved regions bracketing a unique intervening sequence (IVS); the specific region(s) involved in the interaction with CFTR have not been identified. SLC26A9, found in several epithelia including the airways, functions as a constitutively active chloride channel that, when co-expressed with wt CFTR, results in a synergistic increase in the response to cAMP stimulation. This synergism is indicative of reciprocal regulation, and SLC26A9's ability to co-immunoprecipitate wt CFTR suggests they physically interact (J Gen Physiol 2009, 133:421) .",

            "text": "Using the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource (Nucleic Acids Res 2016, 44(D1) :D294), we scanned the STAS domain of SLC26A9 for potential regulatory motifs, and found a motif-rich region in its IVS. A search of NCBI's single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) database identified several SNPs within the IVS. One SNP (rs149474736, S594F), located in a predicted CK2 phosphorylation site also predicted to be part of a 14-3-3 binding motif, led to striking changes. When expressed alone in HEK293 cells, SLC26A9-S594F produced a whole-cell constitutive chloride current of 191 \u00b1 41 pA (n=4), similar to native SLC26A9. When SLC26A9-S594F was co-expressed with wt CFTR, however, constitutive chloride current increased more than 6-fold to 1274 \u00b1 214 pA (n=17), significantly greater than that observed with co-expression of native SLC26A9 and wt CFTR (195 \u00b1 30 pA, n=9) . Cell surface biotinylation did not show increased SLC26A9-S594F protein at the plasma membrane relative to wt SLC26A9, suggesting that the increased activity resulted from the interaction of this variant with CFTR. Because S594 is a predicted phosphorylation site, we also tested alanine and aspartic acid substitutions. Interestingly, SLC26A9-S594A produced the opposite pattern seen with S594F, with high constitutive activity when expressed alone that was substantially diminished with co-expression of wt CFTR. SLC26A9-S594D did not alter constitutive activity.",

STAS(A9) is non-conductive, but it still interacts with wt CFTR to facilitate the synergistic response to cAMP stimulation. Comparison of whole-cell chloride currents measured in HEK293 co-expressing wt CFTR and STAS(A9)-S594X with currents measured in HEK293 co-expressing full length SLC26A9-S594X and wt CFTR confirmed that SLC26A9-S594X was the source of constitutive chloride current. Thus, amino acid substitutions at S594 in the IVS of SLC26A9 led to modifications in its constitutive activity that were enhanced (S594F) or suppressed (S594A) by co-expression with wt CFTR.

CF lung disease develops when defective CFTR HCO 3 channel activity results in airway surface liquid (ASL) acidification. A lower ASL pH causes host defense defects: it reduces the ability of the ASL to kill bacteria and increases ASL viscosity thereby impairing mucociliary clearance (1) (2) (3) . CFTR function is coupled to either ATPase (ATP\u2192ADP + P i ) or adenylate kinase (ATP + AMP\u21942 ADP) activity (4, 5) .

We obtained similar findings with CFTR carrying the CF-associated mutation Q1291H (7). Airway epithelia from CF donors had a lower ASL pH compared to non-CF. Expression of wild-type CFTR corrected the ASL pH but expression of Q1291F CFTR did not. Likewise, wild-type CFTR but not Q1291F CFTR expression increased the ability of the epithelia to kill bacteria and reduced ASL viscosity (the experiments were performed as in Ref. 1) .

            "text": "Supported by CFF and CFFT. Recently, rehydration agents have been gaining attention in treatment of patients with muco-obstructive lung disease, particularly cystic fibrosis (CF). One such agent is inhaled hypertonic saline (HS), which purportedly creates a luminal osmotic ion gradient, drawing additional water onto the dehyrated (concentrated) airway surface layer (ASL). HS has been reported to improve mucus clearance rates, lung function, and reduce the number of acute exacerbations. However, the mechanism and duration of action for mucus hydrating agents to accelerate clearance in CF patients is poorly understood. The mucus layer is a polymer gel that can swell or shrink upon addition or removal of water. Typically, the hydration of the mucus layer is controlled by ion transport across the epithelium. However, in CF, the dysregulation of CFTR-mediated ion transport results in airway fluid depletion and mucin hyperconcentration. We hypothesize that the kinetics of mucus swelling (by added fluid) are determined by the balance between the driving force from osmotic pressure and reversible associations of mucin globular domains, the resistive force from friction of the fluid (i.e. solvent) penetrating through the mesh of mucin network, and the elasticity of the stretched mucins. Further, we hypothesize that there are two stages of mucus swelling: 1) the rapid osmotic gel swelling phase, in which mucus swells without significant rearrangement of inter-molecular associations, and 2) the slow mucus dissolution state in which the mucin molecules continue to rearrange to reduce overlap with one other. To test our hypotheses, we developed a novel dual-labeling imaging technique, to monitor the swelling kinetics of the mucus layer over a range of concentations in reponse to exposure to isotonic solutions. In each experiment, mucus-swelling kinetics were normalized as the increase of swelling height (h t ) to the initial height (h o ) of the mucus layer [(h t -h 0 )/h 0 ] and recorded as a function of time (t). Our results demonstrate that the kinetics of mucus swelling depend on specific mucus properties, e.g., increased initial mucus concentrations and osmotic pressures lead to a faster and longer swelling in all kinds of mucus. CF sputum samples and mucus from human airway cultures show a 2-phase swelling curve, with a fast followed by slow phase until dissolution. This behavior contrasts to mucus obtained from porcine glands (stimulated with acetylcholine), which exhibits a fast swelling phase but then reaches an equilibrium swelling plateau, suggesting that gland mucus is biochemically/ biophysically different from superficial mucus. From a therapeutic perspective, we envision our model system can be applied to test the effectiveness of mucus hydrating agents and other mucolytics designed to re-establish the normal hydration status of the ASL and facilitate efficient mucus clearance. This work was supported by the CFFT Mucus Clearance Consortium. In cystic fibrosis (CF), loss of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel activity causes airway surface liquid (ASL) pH to become acidic, which impairs airway host defenses. One potential therapeutic approach is to correct the acidic pH in CF airways by aerosolizing HCO 3 and/or non-bicarbonate pH buffers. Here, we show that raising ASL pH with inhaled HCO 3 increased pH. However, the effect was transient, and pH returned to baseline values within 30 minutes. Tromethamine or Tham is a buffer with a long serum half-life used as an intravenous formulation to treat metabolic acidosis. We found that tromethamine aerosols increased ASL pH in vivo for at least 2 hours and enhanced bacterial killing. Inhaled hypertonic saline (7% NaCl) is delivered to people with CF in an attempt to promote mucus clearance. Because an increased ionic strength inhibits ASL antimicrobial factors, we added tromethamine to hypertonic saline and applied it to CF sputum. We found that tromethamine alone and in combination with hypertonic saline increased pH and enhanced bacterial killing. These findings suggest that aerosolizing the HCO 3 --independent buffer tromethamine, either alone or in combination with hypertonic saline, might be of therapeutic benefit in CF airway disease.",

Med., Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA Background: Autophagy is a cellular pathway responsible for the trafficking of intracellular cargo within double-membrane structures termed autophagosomes in response to metabolic demands, pathogen recognition, and immune activation. A recently recognized paradigm is that autophagy proteins are necessary for protein secretion. A common gene variant of the autophagy regulatory protein, ATG16L1 (T300A amino acid substitution), has been associated with defects in epithelial secretion and inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (risk, GG vs. non-risk, AA). We recently reported that autophagy is required for IL-13 activated-MUC5AC secretion. It is not known whether autophagy regulates MUC5AC secretion independent of inflammation. The prevalence of the ATG16L1 gene variant in cystic fibrosis (CF) is not known nor is the effect on MUC5AC secretion known.",

Anatomy & Cell Biology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada Balanced fluid secretion and absorption is a crucial part of maintaining a healthy respiratory tract. Failure to maintain a critical volume of airway surface fluid may cause blockage of airflow or lead to reduced mucociliary clearance that normally protects the airway from infection. Epithelial cells regulate the ion and fluid balance; therefore, they are the cornerstone of keeping fluid balance in the airway. As the major contribution of liquid secretion in the upper airway, airway submucosal glands play a major role in secreting airway surface liquid into the large airway. On the other hand in the distal airway, where there are no submucosal glands, the regulation of airway surface liquid layer depends on the balance of secretion and absorption of ions and fluid by the surface epithelia. In CF patients, airway surface liquid volume regulatory function seems to be abnormal which results in the collapse of the innate immune defense.",

Airway surface liquid (ASL) plays an important role in the airway defence mechanism against bacteria. Evidence suggests that abnormal ASL secretion in the CF airways may be involved in CF airway pathogenesis. Recently, we showed that inhalation of Pseudomoas aeruginosa triggered ASL secretion in the upper swine airway ex vivo, and we also suggested a basal spontaneous ASL secretion may protect the airway in normal airway. We hypothesized that in CF airways those responses fail, which leads to the failure to eradicate pathogens. However, whether ASL secretion against inhaled P. aeruginosa actually occurs in vivo or whether this response is missing in CF airway has never been directly tested. We create a novel noninvasive in vivo imaging method to study ASL secretion is swine. We used synchrotron-based phase contrast imaging to overcome the limitations of conventional imaging methods to provide soft tissue discrimination and appropriate spatial and temporal resolution for live animal imaging.

Interestingly, we also detected a basal spontaneous ASL secretion in wild-type animals that was suppressed in CFTR -/swine. Our result indicated that the ASL secretion against inhaled P. aeruginosa is missing in the CF airway, which may contribute to the airway defence failure and further lead to chronic infection and inflammation. Moreover, our result suggested the basal ASL secretion is lost in CFTR-/-piglets. This basal secretion might play a major function that helps the airway defence to trap particles in the inhaled air and explain the mucus viscosity changes in the CF airways.",

Canadian Light Source Inc., Saskatoon, SK, Canada There is strong evidence that CF lung disease starts in the small airway. Studies show that CF children may develop small airways structural damage in very early life. And recent study shows that the newborn CF piglet shows lesions in the airway that appear as regions with obstructed airflow in the distal airways without any obvious evidence of airway infection, inflammation, or mucus accumulation. However, it is still unclear how CFTR dysfunction leads to CF peripheral airway disease. Evidence suggests CF lung lesions occur in the small airways less than 1 mm in diameter. Unfortunately, current imaging methods, such as hospital CT and MRI, are unable to visualize small airways about 1mm in cross section. Thus, a new imaging method is required to provide high-resolution image for the small airways and to perform longitudinal studies in order to follow the development of CF small airway disease.",

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, prominent inflammation with massive expression of the neutrophil chemokine IL-8 and luminal infiltrates of neutrophils are hallmarks of chronic lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The nociceptive transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) calcium channels have recently been found involved in non-neurogenic inflammation. Here, we investigated the role of TRPA1 in CF respiratory inflammatory models in vitro. Expression of TRPA1 was evaluated in CF lung tissue sections and cells by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Epithelial cell lines (A549, IB3-1, CuFi-1, CFBE41o -) and primary cells from CF patients were utilized to a) check TRPA1 function modulation, by Fura-2 calcium imaging; b) down-modulate TRPA1 function and expression with pharmacological inhibitors (HC-030031 and A-967079) and siRNA silencing; and c) assess the effect of TRPA1 down-modulation on expression and release of cytokines upon exposure to pro-inflammatory challenges, by qRT-PCR and 27-protein Bioplex assay. TRPA1 channels are expressed in the CF pseudostratified columnar epithelium facing the bronchial lumina exposed to bacteria, where IL-8 is co-expressed. Inhibition of TRPA1 expression results in a relevant reduction of release of several cytokines, including IL-8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, in CF primary bronchial epithelial cells exposed to P. aeruginosa and to the supernatant of mucopurulent material (SMM) derived from the chronically infected airways of CF patients. In conclusion, TRPA1 channels are involved in regulating the extent of airway inflammation driven by CF bronchial epithelial cells. ] are key regulators of the activities of ion transporters and channels involved in transepithelial fluid secretion in airway epithelia. Dysregulated intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis in CF bronchial epithelial cells has been claimed as a potential druggable target to compensate for CFTR Cltransport defect and/or to reduce excessive CF lung inflammation (as a summary see the Figure) . However, the precise identification of the Ca 2+ transporter/channel to be targeted is contradictory and requires further understanding on the pros and cons of pharmacological modulation of intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization. Here we present results focusing on the role of some of the intracellular Ca 2+ modulators activated upon interaction of P. aeruginosa with bronchial epithelial cells, inducing the classical intracellular pro-inflammatory signaling leading to upregulation of IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 release. We previously showed that direct interaction of P. aeruginosa with toll-like receptors (TLR2, 5 and 4) strongly overexpresses the IL-8 gene by MyD88/dependent phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and downstream kinases RSK1/2 and HSP27, leading to intranuclear translocation of transcription factors such as NF-kB, NF-IL6, AP-1, CREB and CHOP. Release of ATP in the extracellular milieu is able to sustain a P2Y purinergic receptors-and phospolipase C beta 3-dependent release of intracellular Ca 2+ which potentiates the MyD88-dependent inflammatory pathways. More recently, we observed that flagellin from P. aeruginosa alters in a CF-specific manner the Ca 2+ homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial perturbation with increased Ca 2+ influx and production of reactive oxygen species, which drives to exaggerated inflammasome activation and the release of IL-1b. This opens further questions on the role of the different intracellular Ca 2+ compartments and subcellular domains, widening the panel of candidate molecular targets to be considered. Gastrointestinal disease is one of the earliest manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) and presents life-long conditions such as dysbiosis, low-grade inflammation and an increased risk for gastrointestinal cancer. Recently it was shown that ~60% of aged CF mice develop intestinal polyps and altered Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, a pathway responsible for intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation (Than BL, et al. Oncogene. 2016 :doi:10.1038 / onc.2015 . Based on previous evidence of intestinal hyperproliferation in CF mice, we investigated two hypotheses using sex-matched wildtype (WT) and Cftr knockout (KO) mice. In the first hypothesis, we asked whether Cftr KO intestinal hyperproliferation was either an epithelial-autonomous effect of Cftr loss or secondary to the environmental conditions of the CF intestine. For this study, comparisons were made between freshly isolated intestinal crypts (ex vivo) and intestinal epithelial crypt organoids (enteroids) grown and passaged in primary culture. Relative to WT, ex vivo Cftr KO crypts and Cftr KO enteroids (devoid of inflammation, microbiome, systemic factors) had similar increases in epithelial proliferation (+34% vs.+37%), numbers of ISCs (30% vs 74%) and levels of active \u03b2-catenin and the Wnt target gene Lef1. Previous studies have shown that binding of the signaling mediator disheveled (Dvl) to the Wnt receptor frizzled (Fz) is stabilized by a pH-sensitive interaction at the plasma membrane that facilitates Wnt signaling. Since we have shown that the Cftr KO crypt epithelium maintains an alkaline intracellular pH (Liu J, et al. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2012; 302:C1492-503) , it was hypothesized that Dvl would be more closely associated with the plasma membrane in Cftr KO relative to WT enteroids. Using enteroids from Cftr KO and WT mice bred to Dvl2-EGFP/Rosa plasma membrane dTomato mice, it was found that Dvl2-EGFP more closely associated with the plasma membrane at the apical pole of crypt base cells in Cftr KO crypts. Reduction of Dvl2 association at the apical pole by reducing intracellular pH in Cftr KO enteroids was correlated with decreased active \u03b2-catenin and proliferation. We conclude that 1) intestinal hyperproliferation in the Cftr KO intestine is an epithelial-autonomous consequence of Cftr loss; and 2) a potential mechanism of increased Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and hyperproliferation in the Cftr KO intestine is increased Dvl2 plasma membrane association resulting from dysregulated intracellular pH in crypt base cells.

Background: Measurements of airway surface liquid (ASL) on primary airway epithelial cultures (AECs) grown at air-liquid interface (ALI) identified ASL depletion as a characteristic abnormality in cystic fibrosis (CF) and may be used as an endpoint for preclinical testing of strategies to improve airway surface hydration in patients with CF. Traditionally, ASL height has been measured by fluorescent confocal microscopy after addition of fluorescently labelled liquid to the apical surface of the epithelium, however, several hours are required to restore steady state ASL depth after this volume challenge.",

This approach may facilitate preclinical evaluation of novel drugs designed to improve airway surface hydration in patients with CF under more physiological conditions. Supported by BMBF (82DZL00401). Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a destructive serine protease found in the primary granules of neutrophils and is predominantly inhibited by alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). NE plays a major role in pulmonary inflammation and unchecked lung levels of released active NE can cleave elastin, leading to structural damage and impaired lung function. Exaggerated NE levels also compromise the protective antimicrobial screen of the lung by degrading important anti-proteases and antimicrobial peptides. For this reason, NE is a major drug target for novel therapies in inflammatory lung disease, including cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). In this study, we evaluated a novel Protein Epitope Mimetic (PEM) NE inhibitor (POL6014) for therapeutic potential in CF, NCFB and AATD by comparing IC 50 values with a prototype inhibitor (AZD9668) and the known endogenous inhibitor, AAT, in lung fluids, whilst also evaluating its toxicity and functional effect on neutrophils.",

Introduction: Defective CFTR function affects most mucin-producing organs. More specifically, the CF pathogenesis is characterized by the build-up of viscous mucus in organs such as the lungs, sinuses, intestine, pancreas and reproductive tract. For this reason, CF is also known as mucoviscidosis, suggesting that polymeric, gel-forming mucins, the large O-linked glycoproteins responsible for the viscoelastic properties of mucus, play a critical role in the disease. CFTR malfunction causes reduced transepithelial Clsecretion, Na + hyperabsorption, and mucin hyperconcentration, which results in slowed mucociliary clearance (MCC). Our goal is to understand the factors that regulate mucus viscoelasticity and restore normal mucus properties in CF. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator (e.g., targeting G551D mutation), was shown to yield large improvements in lung function. Ivacaftor was also shown to dramatically increase the rate of MCC and significantly improve ventilation defects, suggesting an effect on mucus biophysical properties. However, direct effects of CFTR rescue on mucin concentration and mucus transportability have not been established.",

We are currently working at collecting undiluted mucus from these cells to measure percent solids and passive bead diffusion (i.e., microrheology). Using these two approaches, we showed that gut mucus was more concentrated in cf mice (7.7% vs 4.6% in WT mice) and bead sub-diffusivity was reduced 100-fold in cf mucus, confirming a robust gut/mucus phenotype in this model. We then tested CFTR modulators on murine enteroids to uncover potential compound(s) that would rescue murine Cftr activity.

These modulator compounds are being used in vivo to study the effects of Cftr rescue on mucus concentration, pH, viscoelastic properties, bacterial burden and GI transit. Chronic inflammation remains a challenge for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Left untreated, inflammation contributes largely to pulmonary lung function decline. High-dose ibuprofen is currently the only anti-inflammatory approved by the CF Foundation, where benefits include decreased lung disease progression, reduced neutrophil migration, and decreased propensity for nasal polyp growth; however, the mechanism of action is unclear. Further, only 3.3% of patients are prescribed high-dose ibuprofen due to potential side effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding and renal injury. There is a clear need to understand the mechanism of ibuprofen efficacy in order to develop an effective and safer replacement. Previously in our lab, we have reported that microtubule acetylation expression and polymerization rates are decreased in CF epithelial cells. The decrease in microtubule formation rate contributes to decreased intracellular transport and thus inflammatory signaling. Here, we hypothesize that high-dose ibuprofen improves inflammation via improved microtubule structure and dynamics. Microtubule polymerization rates were analyzed by the initiation of microtubule formation, where the percent of cells with an alpha-tubulin aster at various time points was determined. After high-dose ibuprofen (500\u03bcM) for 24 hours, there was a 33.5% increase in CF (IB3-1) cells with asters after 8 minutes of re-polymerization, normalizing it to wild-type cells. Functionally, there were 45% less CF cells with accumulated cholesterol after being treated with high-dose ibuprofen, indicating a reinstatement of intracellular transport. Comparing microtubule polymerization rates to other analgesics and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (ie aspirin, acetaminophen, and celecoxib), the reformation of microtubules was specific to high-dose ibuprofen, where no other drug significantly increased CF microtubule formation rates. Enhanced microtubule polymerization was confirmed in primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells obtained from CF patients after ibuprofen treatment. Mechanistically, effects of ibuprofen were mimicked by stimulation of AMPK (AICAR, 500 \u03bcM, 24h), where there was a 34.6% increase in CF (IB3-1) cells with asters after 8 minutes of re-polymerization and a 51.2% reduction in CF cells with accumulated cholesterol. Effects of ibuprofen were blocked with AMPK inhibitor compound c. It is concluded that highdose ibuprofen treatment enhances microtubule formation in CF cells likely through an AMPK-related pathway, implicating microtubule structure and dynamics as an important facet linking CFTR to inflammation.

CFTR dysfunction affects multiple complex and interactive elements of the airway electrophysiology network that ultimately lead to organ level disease. There exist several experimental techniques that allow for the characterization of the interactions governing such mechanisms. However, they generally lack the ability to provide simultaneous information about the individual dynamics of multiple network elements without the need to significantly perturb the nature of the monolayer. Here we describe the development of an in silico, compartment-based model that allows for the exploration of these interactive elements, and captures the volume regulation and ion transport under the conditions of an Ussing chamber (UC) experiment. Methods: The model is centered on a cellular compartment interfacing two semi-infinite source/sinks representing the apical and basolateral fluid volumes in an UC. We generated a system of differential algebraic equations that relate changes in the intracellular electrolyte concentration, membrane potentials and ion movement as functions of time. UC experiments on fully differentiated, primary human bronchial epithelia (HBE) cultures were used to inform the model. Parameters for cellular volume regulation, some ionic fluxes and permeabilities were estimated using nonlinear regression on unperturbed UC short-circuit current data obtained under isotonic conditions.

With approximately 70,000 sufferers and 8 million carriers, cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases worldwide. Mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene result in altered anion (Cland HCO 3 -) secretion across airway epithelia. This, in combination with hyperabsorption of Na + , via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), leads to reduced airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, impaired mucociliary clearance, chronic inflammation and bacterial colonization in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. Excessive volumes of mucopurulent material (MM) present within CF airways results in airway obstruction and in turn airway obstructive disease, reported to account for up to 8 out of 10 deaths in CF patients. In addition, MM present within CF lungs contains numerous proteases which may abnormally regulate ENaC activation and degrade ASL proteins required for innate defense. We have previously reported that the secreted protein, SPLUNC1, regulates ENaC activity and ASL hydration levels and that SPLUNC1's regulation of ENaC is defective in CF airways. (1) Furthermore as past studies have shown that proteases cleave SPLUNC1, we hypothesize that proteases present within CF mucopurulent material can cleave SPLUNC1 and may alter its ability to regulate ENaC. Postmortem MM was harvested from Pseudomonas aeruginosa-and Staphyloccocus aureus-positive CF lungs. SPLUNC1 levels were determined by Western blot following incubation with MM at 37\u00b0C, in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. Significant breakdown of 10 \u03bcM SPLUNC1 was observed after incubation with MM diluted 1:2 with PBS (t 1/2 = 1.17 hours; N = 3). MM was pre-incubated with protease inhibitors including aprotinin, EDTA, E64 and leupeptinin to determine which enzymes were responsible for SPLUNC1's cleavage. These compounds failed to inhibit SPLUNC1 cleavage (all N = 3). Sivelestat, a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor, significantly prevented SPLUNC1 cleavage (10\u03bcM **** p < 0.0001, N = 4). Given that SPLUNC1 regulates ENaC activity and SPLUNC1 is cleaved by MM, the effects of MM and SPLUNC1, alone and in combination, on ENaC protein levels in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were investigated. Proteolytic cleavage of \u03b3ENaC is indicated from our preliminary data (N = 3), with increased levels of cleaved \u03b3ENaC subunit expression observed compared with controls. Conversely, decreased \u03b3ENaC protein levels, consistent with ENaC degradation and reduced ENaC activity, were evident in normal HBECs incubated with SPLUNC1 alone or SPLUNC1 and MM in combination. The effect of SPLUNC1 and MM in CF HBECs remains to be determined. In conclusion, we have shown that MM readily cleaves SPLUNC1, and that cleavage can be prevented by the neutrophil elastase inhibitor sivelestat. Abnormal cleavage of SPLUNC1 in CF MM may impair SPLUNC1's ability to regulate innate defense in CF airways.",

CF patients commonly present with persistent pulmonary bacterial infections that correspond with worsening of clinical prognosis. Sphingomyelinase (SMase), an enzyme that cleaves the membrane lipid sphingomyelin into phosphocholine and ceramide, is a secreted bacterial virulence factor that has been shown to inhibit CFTR chloride channel function and may contribute to the observed exacerbation of disease by dehydrating airways and facilitating bronchial plugging. The goal of this study is to determine the mechanism by which SMase inhibits CFTR channel activity.",

Additionally, we found evidence that inhibition of CFTR channel activity by S. aureus SMase occurs via a novel, state-dependent process. Inhibition occurs at the plasma membrane and does not rely on the regulatory (R) domain. Patch-clamp experiments also indicate that inhibition is not membrane delimited which suggests that the effect relies on an intracellular factor. Experiments performed with mutant channels showed that channels with increased activity have a decreased sensitivity to inhibition by SMase; conversely, mutations that decrease channel activity increase sensitivity to inhibition, which suggests that inhibition represents CFTR being locked into a closed state. Finally, we found that Kalydeco pretreatment can protect CFTR from the inhibitory effect of SMase supporting the conclusion that SMase targets a closed state of CFTR.",

Four sows produced 18 piglets of which 11 were stillborn with only 2 animals surviving beyond 2 weeks. Failure to survive beyond the neonatal period by 5 piglets was judged to result from metabolic dysfunction likely related to the genetic manipulation for CFTR gut expression or due to cloning artifact. Plasma analysis of neonatal animals showed very low plasma proteins, highly elevated liver enzymes, and severe acidosis. All surviving offspring received furosemide for systemic edema. One piglet survived to 2 weeks with intensive care and was humanely euthanized due to respiratory distress and generalized, severe edema. At necropsy, findings suggested that the clinical features observed were unrelated to any CF phenotype and were consistent with what was observed in the neonatal animals. Physiologic evaluation was performed with lung tissues from the 2 pigs that survived to 2 months of age. Both acetylcholine-and forskolin-induced mucous liquid secretion were significantly lower in CF bronchi than non-CF bronchi. The percent nonvolatile solids in mucus secreted from CF bronchi was elevated following acetylcholine or forskolin compared to mucus secreted from non-CF bronchi. Mucociliary transport in excised tracheas was reduced in the CF tracheas relative to non-CF tracheas. The diameter of CF tracheas was less than that of non-CF pigs in spite of their greater body weight. Despite exhibiting severe metabolic dysfunction and very high mortality during the neonatal period, this CF animal model appears to express important characteristics of human CF pulmonary disease. ( Chronic infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is associated with an accelerated decline of lung function. PA bacteria cultured from CF sputum secrete alginate, a major component of biofilms. Biofilms protect bacteria against killing by antibiotics and host defenses. The novel alginate oligomer OligoG CF-5/20 is a low molecular weight oligosaccharide enriched from sodium alginate polysaccharides. It is an oligomer composed of \u03b1-L-guluronic acid (G) (>85%) and \u03b2-Dmannuronic acid (M) (<15%). OligoG CF-5/20 is currently in Phase 2b clinical trials in CF patients. Previous in vitro studies have shown the ability of OligoG CF-5/20 to disrupt biofilm formation and to potentiate the effects of certain antibiotics. Moreover, these G-rich oligomers have also been shown to disrupt interactions in complex mucus by reducing cross-linking within mucus. G subunits preferentially bind calcium, a divalent cation that crosslinks PA alginate polymers, and increases PA biofilm gelation.",

In the non-CF epithelium this is mediated through both cAMP (CFTR) and Ca 2+ (TMEM16A) regulated anion conductances. This homeostatic mechanism has likely developed to ensure appropriate hydration of the mucus gel and therefore enable mucus and pathogen clearance. A similar FLG-driven goblet cell phenotype in the CF airway may further imbalance the mucin-fluid load in the absence of CFTR function, predisposing to mucus plugging, a failure to clear the plugs and further contributing to chronic colonisation of the lung. Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterised by sustained neutrophil recruitment and neutrophildominated infiltration. Plasma membrane metalloproteinases ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 are involved in the cleavage of pro-inflammatory membrane (m) bound cytokine mTNF-\u03b1 and receptor mIL-6r further augmenting inflammation. Cholesterol, a major structural component of membranes, influences membrane stability and the activity of proteins that reside there. We have previously demonstrated that neutrophil plasma membrane cholesterol was reduced in CF. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of reduced neutrophil plasma membrane cholesterol content on the activity of ADAM-17 in adults with CF. More specifically, our objective was to investigate the circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1 soluble receptor TNFR1 and sIL-6r, and to determine whether ivacaftor therapy mediates a reduction in ADAM-17 activity, indirectly reducing inflammation.",

These patients may derive therapeutic benefit from Clsecretagogues. Objective: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects nearly 16% of the US population each year with an estimated 13 million yearly physician visits and has an enormous impact on quality of life. Sinusitis is a heterogeneous disease with a universal hallmark involving dysfunctional mucociliary clearance (MCC), reminiscent of cystic fibrosis (CF). The objective of the current study is to investigate the influence of mucus stasis on the transepithelial chloride transport using a preclinical (rabbit) model of rhinosinusitis. Rabbits were chosen because small rodents do not reproduce key aspects of human upper airway physiology and our previous experiments showed that rabbit and human nasal epithelium have similar physiologic features in vitro.",

This inflammation results in high levels of enzymes such as neutrophilic elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase which damage the airways and perpetuate inflammation.

By downregulation of PPAR\u03b3 and its dependent genes these pathogens compromise phagocytosis and enhance virulence. Our studies suggest a role for PPAR\u03b3 immunotherapy for P. aeruginosa infections in patients with CF. Epidemiological studies suggest that antiviral host defenses may be compromised in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), as patients exhibit prolonged recovery times and frequent hospitalizations in association with viral respiratory infections. In vitro studies implicate impaired antiviral responses in airway epithelia as a feature of this phenotype. The airways are home to multilayered antiviral host defenses, which may be cell-based or extracellular. Compared with non-CF cells, CF airway epithelia support greater levels of viral infection and replication when infected with several classes of respiratory viruses, and exhibit dysregulated expression of several gene products involved in host defense. In this study, we hypothesized that airway surface liquid exhibits direct antiviral activity and, further, that the antiviral activity of respiratory secretions is reduced in CF. To test these hypotheses, we developed an in vitro assay to measure the innate antiviral activity present in native airway secretions from CF and non-CF pigs. We found that cell-free tracheal and nasal secretions from newborn non-CF pigs exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory activity against several enveloped and encapsidated viruses including Sendai virus (SeV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and adenovirus. This activity, which was heat labile, was also detected in human nasal secretions. Importantly, we found that the anti-SeV activity of nasal secretions from newborn CF pigs was significantly diminished relative to non-CF littermate controls. When we mixed CF and non-CF secretions at varying ratios, we observed a correlation between the amount of non-CF secretions and anti-SeV activity, suggesting the possibility of reduced abundance or function of antiviral factors in CF secretions. Based on previous reports that cathepsin activity is elevated in CF airway fluids from human subjects, we measured cysteine protease activity in newborn CF and non-CF pig secretions. We found increased cathepsin B, L, and S-like activity in BAL from newborn CF pigs, relative to non-CF littermates; similarly, we observed a trend toward increased cathepsin B activity in newborn CF nasal secretions. We observed that the anti-SeV activity of the pig antimicrobial peptide protegrin-1 was abolished by pre-treatment with cathepsin B, suggesting that increased cathepsin activity may negatively influence the activity of secreted antiviral factors. Our data indicate that native airway secretions exhibit inhibitory activity against viruses, and that, at birth, the antiviral capacity of CF airway secretions is diminished relative to non-CF. Future studies will investigate the possible contributions of secreted proteases to this phenomenon, as well as the overall impact of loss of CFTR function on cellular and extracellular antiviral defenses on the onset and progression of CF lung disease.",

Although several mechanisms linking abnormal ion secretion and inflammatory dysregulation have been suggested, the link between CFTR function and altered inflammatory response needs to be better understood. Lipid raft microdomains (LRM) are specialized regions of the plasma membrane with a particular lipid and protein composition. We and others have shown that CFTR in LRM is a critical modulator of the inflammatory and the immune responses. In the present work, we investigated if the F508del CFTR mutant modifies the proteome of LRM in proinflammatory conditions. Methods: HeLa cells stably transfected with either wild-type or F508del-CFTR were grown in DMEM with Lys6/Arg6 or Lys0/Arg0 and incubated for 10min with 100U/mL of TNF-\u03b1. Cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 for 1h at 4\u00b0C. Cell lysates with equal amounts of proteins were centrifuged in a sucrose density gradient for 3h at 166,000g at 4\u00b0C to purify LRM. LRM were trypsin-digested, and peptides analyzed by nano-RSLC LTQ-Orbitrap velos MS in a 40min gradient. Proteins were quantified by a SILAC approach using MaxQuant and statistical analysis was performed with Perseus.",

Preliminary data: In order to discriminate between changes in recruitment in lipid rafts and changes of global expression of the proteins, we analyzed the total proteome to unveil proteins that are constitutively differentially expressed between the WT and F508del-CFTR cells. In the total cell, 1381 proteins were identified and quantified. In parallel, we analyzed the LRM fraction to identify proteins that are differentially recruited in the lipid rafts. In the LRM fraction we could identify and quantify 332 proteins, of which 66 could be identified only in LRM. Among the 332 proteins, 22 proteins showed significant ratio variations after TNF-\u03b1 stimulation. Out of the 22 proteins differentially recruited in LRM after inflammatory exposure, 17 were increased in F508del cells with respect to wild-type, including G-protein coupled receptors, anion transporters, and one cell-surface mucin. In both HeLa and CFBE cells, we confirmed that one of the G-protein coupled receptor GRPC5A relocates to LRM along with F508del-CFTR after 10 min of TNF-\u03b1 treatment. These results could enlighten the crosstalk between CFTR and TNF-\u03b1 and its impact on the cell response to inflammatory challenge, and support and extend our recent findings (Bitam S, et al.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease is characterized by thickened mucus of increased viscoelastic properties which results in poor clearance from the lung and increased infection and airway inflammation. Currently, there is a debate in the CF community as to the cause of pathologically thickened mucus. One hypothesis is that defective chloride transport by absent or misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) results in sodium hyperabsorption to maintain intracellular ionic balance. In this hypothesis, water moves with sodium from the airway lumen into the underlying cellular epithelium, thereby dehydrating the airway surface layer (ASL) and creating a high concentration mucus with increased viscoelastic properties. A competing hypothesis is that the defective CFTR inhibits bicarbonate secretion into the ASL which results in acidification of the ASL, thereby increasing the rheological properties of the mucus layer and impeding clearance. We seek to define the relative contributions of each competing hypothesis (mucus pH and concentration) to the increased viscoelastic properties of CF mucus. We perform all of our assays on mucus harvested from our human bronchial epithelial cell culture model system which allows for control of mucus concentration as defined by % solids dry weight, as well as the pH. Our results show that altering pH from 8 to 6 results in a doubling of the viscosity of mucus of 2% solids mucus. However, our results also show that doubling the concentration of mucus from 2% solids to 4% solids results in a 10-fold increase in the viscosity of mucus. Further, the increases in mucus concentration results in an increase in the buffer capacity of mucus, making it more resistant to changes in pH. Taken together, our results show that pH alters the viscosity of low concentration mucus, but that effect is diminished at high mucus % solids. The data further show that % solids is ultimately the dominant factor in creating the highly viscous mucus that is a hallmark of CF airway disease.",

Respiratory Medicine, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, WA, Australia The AREST CF project represents a unique opportunity to document the early onset of airways disease in cystic fibrosis. In this ongoing study, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples are being collected from pediatric patients at regular intervals over the first 6 years of life. The goal of our analysis is to investigate changes in the rheological properties of mucus brought on by CF airway disease. We have previously shown that CF sputum is characterized by significantly increased mucin concentration [1] , resulting in modified biophysical properties such as viscoelasticity and osmotic pressure [2, 3] . Due to the dilute nature of BAL samples, determining the native concentration of mucus along the airways from BAL samples has proven impossible. While small flecks of concentrated, viscoelastic mucus are present in the pediatric CF BALs, the samples also contain highly diluted mucus that is rheologically identical to saline. By combining sophisticated microbead rheological measurements of BAL samples with advanced data analytics, we are able to determine a diversity of rheological microenvironments in which tracer particles are sampling. Specifically, we embed 1 micron diameter tracer particles into the sample volume and analyze their diffusive fluctuations. Analytically, we firstly determine which particle tracked paths are consistent with normal saline and exclude those from further analysis. For non-excluded particles, anomalous sub-diffusion parameters of each particle path are calculated [4] , reflecting motilities from a range of diluted to pure mucus sample. We compare our results to adult CF and normal BALs, finding that the samples collected from the pediatric AREST participants display a rheology that lies between that of healthy adults and adult CF patients. We additionally compare the results of over 150,000 particle tracks from 64 patients and 12 non-CF pediatric disease patients with traditional clinical biomarkers such as CT scan scoring and cell counts. The mechanism by which loss of CFTR leads to blunted PI3K/ AKT signaling in response to TLR4 activation remains to be investigated. Here we test whether ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins that bridge the cytoskeleton to cell membrane proteins, links CFTR and PI3K/AKT signaling.",

Human M\u03a6s were differentiated from peripheral blood of healthy donors (HD) (n=5) or CF patients (n=5) for 10 days in human M-CSF. Murine M\u03a6 cell lines (J774A.1) were stably infected with a retroviral vector expressing an shRNA against ezrin (shRNA-Ezr) or a scramble control (shRNA-CTR). For the celecoxib study, murine and human M\u03a6s were treated overnight with 25mM celecoxib or vehicle (DMSO) and then challenged with LPS.",

            "text": "Results: Using confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we show that in response to LPS, M\u03a6s form plasma membrane ruffles with high levels of ezrin. In contrast, loss of CFTR in M\u03a6s causes a profound reduction of ezrin protein levels in the plasma membrane ruffles in response to LPS. In activated CF M\u03a6s, ezrin is trapped intracellularly and fails to be phosphorylated at its actin-binding domain, thus leading to proteasomedependent degradation. Reduced ezrin is also observed in human CF M\u03a6s bearing Class I-II (n=3) but not mild CFTR mutations (n=2). Studies in shRNA-Ezr-M\u03a6s reveal that ezrin is required for PI3K/AKT induction in response to LPS. Low levels of ezrin in M\u03a6s also augment TLR4 signaling in response to LPS, and impair Pseudomonas aeruginosa phagocytosis. Treatment with celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that we have previously used to reestablish PI3K/AKT signaling in CF M\u03a6s challenged with LPS and to reduce lung hyperinflammation in CF mice, increases ezrin levels and promotes its phosphorylation in CF cells. Thus, we speculate that the beneficial effects of celecoxib in CF M\u03a6s are, in part, due to ezrin protein stabilization, which ensures efficient PI3K/AKT signaling in response to LPS.",

Gregory Fleming James Cystic Fibrosis Research Ctr, Birmingham, AL, USA Background: Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a critical defense mechanism of the human respiratory system. In CF, the impairment of MCC often leads to severe morbidity such as obstruction of the airways and increased susceptibility to chronic lung infection. By providing high resolution (1-2 \u03bcm) cross-sectional imaging capabilities at rapid imaging speed (40 frames per second), the \u03bcOCT (Liu L, et al. PLoS One 2013; 8:e54473) technology that our group has pioneered is a useful and unique tool capable of facilitating the understanding of the mechanistic pathways associated with CF pathogenesis.",

To improve the clinical utility of \u03bcOCT for CF studies, we now report the implementation of a flexible \u03bcOCT probe that is designed to be compatible with a standard clinical bronchoscope. The probe has a smaller diameter of 2.5 mm and transduces beam scanning motion using a flexible polyetheretherketone tube. The new design allows the probe to fit into the instrument channel of a bronchoscope. At the proximal end, a piezo-electric stack motor is attached to the instrument channel of the bronchoscope via a customized ergonomic attachment. The piezo motor provides a longitudinal scan at 40 Hz over an approximate 200 \u03bcm field of view.",

Figure: A comparison of mouse trachea tissue images obtained from the benchtop \u00b5OCT system (left) and from the flexible bronchial probe (right). Cilia tips (green arrows) and periciliary liquid (PCL) layer (red bar) are seen on the surface of the epithelial layer (EP). Tracheal submucosal glands (SMGs) impact airway health by secreting mucus and serous fluids and by contributing to cellular regeneration as a tissue-specific stem cell (SC) niche. It has been shown that CFTR defects lead to dysregulation in the SMG SC niche likely through altered gland secretions, but much is still unknown regarding how glandular SCs are regulated. Wnt signaling is required for lineage commitment of glandular SCs during SMG morphogenesis from the surface airway epithelium (SAE). Whether similar Wnt-dependent processes coordinate SC expansion in adult SMGs following airway injury remains unknown. We found that two Wntreporters in mice (BAT-gal and TCF/Lef:H2B-GFP) are co-expressed in actively cycling SCs of primordial glandular placodes and in a small subset of adult SMG progenitor cells that enter the cell cycle 24 hours following airway injury. At homeostasis, these Wnt reporters showed nonoverlapping cellular patterns of expression in the SAE and SMGs. Following tracheal injury, proliferation was accompanied by dynamic changes in Wnt-reporter activity and the analysis of 56 Wnt-related signaling genes revealed unique temporal changes in expression within proximal (gland-containing) and distal (gland-free) portions of the trachea. For example, seven Wnt ligands (Wnt10a, Wnt10b, Wnt2, Wnt3a, Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt6) and six Wnt receptors (Fzd1, Fzd2, Fzd5, Fzd7, Lrp5, Lrp6) were differentially regulated. Additionally, Wnt modulators (Dkk2, Dkkl1, Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Bambi, Dvl1, Wif1) and downstream targets of Wnt signaling (Wisp2, Ccnd3, Myc) were also differentially expressed following injury. Wnt stimulation in vivo and in vitro promoted epithelial proliferation in both SMGs and the SAE. Interestingly, slowly cycling nucleotide label-retaining cells (LRCs) of SMGs were spatially positioned near clusters of BAT-gal positive serous tubules. Isolation and culture of tet-inducible H2B-GFP LRCs demonstrated that SMG LRCs were more proliferative than SAE LRCs and culture expanded SMG-derived progenitor cells outcompeted SAE-derived progenitors in regeneration of tracheal xenograft epithelium using a clonal analysis competition assay. SMG-derived progenitors were also multipotent for cell types in the surface airway epithelium and formed gland-like structures in xenografts. These studies demonstrate the importance of Wnt signals in modulating SC phenotypes within tracheal niches and provide new insight into phenotypic differences of SMG and SAE SCs. These studies also provide a foundation for the isolation and propagation of multipotent glandular progenitors that may be useful for SC therapies for CF airway disease.",

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen causing infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Chronic CF airways are also characterized by robust neutrophilic infiltration. Neutrophils fight P. aeruginosa by multiple mechanisms: besides phagocytosis, they also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to trap pathogens. NETs are composed of extracellular DNA decorated with histones and granule components. NETs are present in CF airways indicating that recruited neutrophils extrude NETs -most likely in response to bacteria including P. aeruginosa. Although clinically a potentially relevant mechanism in CF, the details of P. aeruginosa-induced NET formation remain unclear. Previously, we have shown that laboratory standard strains and CF isolates of P. aeruginosa are all strong inducers of NET formation in human neutrophils in vitro. To identify which bacterial components are crucial for NET induction, we cultured P. aeruginosa for different lengths of time representing bacteria in their early or late exponential, or early stationary growth phases. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa in the early exponential growth phase triggered the most robust NET formation while bacteria from older cultures led to diminished NET release. This indicated that bacterial components/virulence factors characteristic in their early growth phase are mainly responsible for triggering NET formation. Aflagellated mutants of P. aeruginosa PAK and PAO1 were seriously impaired in triggering NETs. Purified flagellum or flagellin monomers failed to stimulate NET release in human neutrophils. TLR5-blocking antibodies did not influence the ability of P. aeruginosa to trigger NET release. Similarly, murine neutrophils deficient in the main flagellin-sensing receptors, TLR5 and NLRC4, release NETs in response to P. aeruginosa just as wild-type neutrophils. The seemingly paradoxical finding of P. aeruginosa-induced NET release being flagellum-dependent but TLR5-and NLRC4-independent could be explained by the requirement of flagellar motility. The main function of the flagellum is to provide the bacterium with the ability to swim. We tested flagellar motor-deficient P. aeruginosa PAK mutants (DmotABD, DmotBCD) that express flagellum but are unable to move it for their ability to induce NETs in human neutrophils. Interestingly, we have found that motor-deficient mutants were incapable of inducing NET formation. In summary, we identified the bacterial flagellum as the major component of P. aeruginosa to induce NETs. The flagellum does not stimulate NET formation by binding to flagellum-sensing receptors but by providing swimming motility. We speculate that this mechanism could be also partially responsible for the well-described loss of flagellum of P. aeruginosa during CF airway infections.",

We then hypothesized that some of these compounds may block IL-13 induced GCM. We exposed HAE cultures to IL-13 and IL-4 in the presence of the top 6 compounds. Multiple compounds prevented IL-13-induced GCM, including blockers of pathways known to play a role in GCM.

Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Introduction: Meconium ileus (MI) , intestinal obstruction at birth, is heritable and previous genome-wide association studies for MI by the International CF Gene Modifier Consortium (ICFGMC) identified SNPs near SLC26A9 and SLC6A14; these findings have since been replicated and shown to contribute to disease severity in other CF-affected organs such as the lungs. Here we report the results of a meta-GWAS for MI with an expanded CF population in the ICFGMC, with the goals of identifying additional loci that contribute to MI susceptibility and additional insight into disease severity in other CF-affected organs.",

Each of the four cohorts were analyzed at all SNPs across the genome separately, and then combined using random effects meta-analysis. For the Johns Hopkins cohort containing siblings, generalized estimating equations with a compound symmetry covariance structure was used to account for the relatedness between sibling pairs; all other groups used logistic regression. Genome-wide significant findings and nearby variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) were assessed in the context of publicly available data from the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects.",

These loci included the previously reported MI candidate genes SLC26A9 and SLC6A14, and three novel regions containing PRSS1, ABCG5/ABCG8 and ATP12A. SLC26A9 is an anion transporter/exchanger known to interact with CFTR. SLC6A14 encodes an amino acid transporter expressed in the intestine. Rs12710568 is in high LD with the top ranked SNP at the SLC6A14 locus and falls in the putative promoter for the gene. Analysis in the context of chromatin states, DNase hypersensitivity and transcription factor binding data enables us to narrow the SLC26A9 regional association to SNPs close to the transcription start site of SLC26A9 that may influence expression levels. PRSS1 encodes cationic trypsinogen, a protease from the pancreas, with elevated serum levels indicating CF in newborns. Given our PRSS1 regional association (rs9969188) and recently reported luciferase assays with a promoter variant in strong LD (rs4726576) associated with childhood-onset pancreatitis, it appears that a decrease in PRSS1 levels may increase the risk for MI. ATP12A was recently reported to contribute to CF lung disease, and is a nongastric proton pump. ABCG5 and ABCG8 work together to transport cholesterol and sterols out of the liver, or in and out of enterocytes of the small intestine.",

Marsico Lung Institute, Univ of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Background: CF-related diabetes (CFRD) develops over time in adolescents and adults with CF and causes worse lung function and mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated that variation in the risk of CFRD is due to genes other than CFTR, ie, genetic modifiers. We identified CFRD modifier variants in 5 loci (see below) using a genome-wide and candidate-based association study (BlackmanSM, et al. Diabetes. 2013; 62: 3627-35) . The International CF Gene Modifier Consortium (ICFG-MC) recently increased the sample size and completed a lung phenotype meta-analysis (Corvol H, et al. Nat Commun. 2015; 6:8382) .",

The TCF7L2 locus continued to have strong genome-wide support (P=2.4\u00d710 -11 ). Two loci had variants associated with CFRD with P<1\u00d710 -8 , including chr2q35 (P=5.9\u00d710 -9 ) and chr8q24.3 (P=4.5\u00d710 -11 ). There was no significant evidence of heterogeneity among cohorts at any of the loci (Cochran P=0.41 for chr2q35; P=0.82 for chr8q24.3).

Two linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks defined by a single recombination in intron 8 were identified. Haplotypes were tested for association with CFRD onset using a continuous trait in which severity is reflected by earlier onset CFRD vs. older ages without CFRD diagnosis (Blackman, SM, et al.) . Two common haplotypes (29.2% and 32.7% frequency) within the 5' LD block containing the variants identified by GWAS were associated with higher and lower risk of CFRD, respectively. No coding SNPs were in LD with either haplotype and no individual SNPs showed greater association with CFRD than the two common haplotypes. This suggests that CFRD risk is conferred by either a single SNP in high LD with the remainder of the haplotype, or a combination of these noncoding SNPs.",

Isoforms 2 (ENST000000367134) and 3 (ENST00000340781) both code the same 887aa protein that lacks the PDZ-binding motif. Comparative genomic analysis of SLC26A9 predicts that isoform 1 is present in all species beyond Xenopus, whereas isoforms 2 and 3 are primate-specific. Transcriptome analysis revealed that isoform 1 was the primary transcript in the lung, pancreas, salivary gland, skin and stomach (n=3 per tissue, Human Protein Atlas). Isoform 3 has lower expression, and was only found in lung and skin (4.5% and 43.5% of isoform 1, respectively). Isoform 2 was not identified in any of these tissues. RT-PCR of SLC26A9 RNA transcripts detected abundant isoform 1 in primary stomach, lung, and pancreas tissues, whereas isoforms that do not encode a PDZ-binding motif (ie, isoforms 2 or 3) were only found in the lung.

Immunohistochemistry in human and mouse lung shows that FAM13A is detected in both bronchial and alveolar type II cells. In inflammatory context, FAM13A mRNA expression is downregulated especially by IL-1\u03b2, both in A549 cells and HBEC cells. In order to understand the consequences of this downregulation, we used a siRNA against FAM13A and observed the induction of F-actin stress fibers both in A549 cells and HBEC and an increase of rhoA activity. Conversely, rhoA activity is diminished when FAM13A is overexpressed. Furthermore, inhibition of FAM13A expression enhanced the reduction of the EMT marker E-cadherin expression and the increase of vimentin by TGF\u03b2. Preliminary results using Fam13a -/and wild-type mice showed no differences in weight, appearance or breathing rate.",

Data suggest that FAM13A is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, confirming its expected role as a RhoGAP. FAM13A regulates rhoA activity and may contribute to the EMT process. Future in vivo studies using physiopathological models (TGF\u03b2, F508del-Fam13 -/-) will result in an increased understanding of how this gene affects lung function of CF patients. KS, USA; 2.

North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC, USA Background: In CF, chronic pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa is associated with lung function decline and decreased survival. Studies of heritability for chronic P. aeruginosa infection have shown estimates of 0.76 by concordance analysis, and 0.85 after adjusting for age of onset of infection (Greene, et al, J Pediatr. 2012) . These studies suggest host genetic susceptibility to chronic P. aeruginosa infection. We hypothesized that in vivo human nasal epithelia show differential gene expression associated with age of onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection.",

Subjects above age 7 were required to have at least 1 negative culture before a first positive culture could be considered for analysis (Pittman JE, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2011; 46:497-504) . We performed SAFE pathway analysis integrating principle components and clinical covariates including: sex, lung transplantation, nasal steroid use, and inflammation (indexed by CD45 expression).

Thirty-nine percent were classified as pancreatic insufficient (based on pancreatic enzyme use) and the mean BMI at diagnosis was 23.9\u00b15.2 kg/m 2 . Seven percent of AD CF patients are F508del homozygous, 43% are F508del heterozygous, 19% have two non-F508del mutations, 18% have just one identified mutation, and 13% have no mutations identified or missing genotype data. Twenty percent have mutations that can be targeted by currently available CFTR modulator therapies. Specifically, 10.7% have the R117H mutation, 7.2% are homozygous for F508del, and 2.1% have a G551D gating mutation. No patients with a non-G551D gating mutation were identified in this cohort. The clinical characteristics of AD patients stratified by these mutations are summarized in the Table. Conclusion: Twenty percent of AD CF patients in Canada have mutations that may be targeted by currently available CFTR modulator therapies. CFTR modulator therapies targeting mutations observed more commonly in AD CF patients are needed.",

Introduction: Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with mutations in the CFTR gene, for similar mutations (genotypes), we can observe very different clinical manifestations (phenotypes) from one patient to another. YKL-40 (chitinase 3-like 1 gene; CHI3L1) is an inflammatory marker increased in blood of patients with inflammatory diseases including CF (Hector A, et al. PloS One. 2011; 6:e24399; Kang MJ, et al. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2015; 53:863-71) . Studies have also shown that YKL-40 is inversely correlated with pulmonary function (Hector A et al.) . Specific alteration in gene expression in diseases could be explained by the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in specific regions of the CHI3L1 gene (Thomsen SB, et al. PloS One. 2012; 7:e47094) . The purpose of this study was to determine if the presence of SNPs could change CHI3L1 gene expression and lead to higher levels of YKL-40 as well as a specific clinical profile in CF patients.",

In contrast, using I336K cells, incubation with corrector (VX-661 or VX-809) increased protein levels from 5% (DMSO) to 60% (VX-661) and 100% (VX809) of WT and increased C/C+B ratio from .33 (DMSO) to .84 (VX-661) and .88 (VX-809). Forskolin-stimulated chloride current increased from 8% (DMSO) of WT to 25% (VX-661) and 31% (VX-809). VX-770 further increased currents, resulting in total currents of 56% of WT (VX-661) and 74% (VX-809).",

But this was in stark contrast to R334W, T338I, and R347P, which demonstrated no increase in conductance or response to VX-770 even though they are able to generate properly processed CFTR. Inspection of the location of all 3 nonresponder residues revealed that each is predicted to line the channel pore and actively participate in ion conductance while no such evidence has been published suggesting the same for I336K. We hypothesize that CFTR variants of residues directly involved in ion conductance comprise a unique theratype that may require a new class of molecular therapy. Extensive phenotypic variability is observed in CF patients homozygous for the common CF-causing variant F508del. To determine whether variants at the CFTR locus contribute to this phenotypic variability and also to inform the search for small molecule therapies which target F508del CFTR, we have systematically investigated genetic variation present on CF alleles bearing F508del. Our overarching goal was to identify any variants or combination of variants that modify disease severity associated with the F508del mutation.",

While CFTR is unique among the ABC subfamily C members of transporters due to its intrinsic ability to conduct chloride ion at a much faster rate, it shares the closest homology with ABCC1 and known to interact with CFTR. SNP rs rs504348 falls in the putative promoter for the gene suggesting regulatory effects in its expression and correlation with lung disease severity. Future studies will involve ABCC1 analysis in the context of chromatin states, DNase hypersensitivity and transcription factor binding data enabling us to associate a potential functional SNP of ABCC1 that influences its expression levels with disease severity. The spatial and temporal regulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) in endoderm-derived cell types is tightly regulated. The same cell type, such as lung epithelium, can show dynamic differences in RNA levels during development. Additionally, based on RNA-seq expression values (reads per kilobase per million, or RPKM) in adult epithelial tissues, CFTR is expressed at a broad range of levels, from low in lung epithelial (RPKM 1-6) to modest expression in pancreatic epithelial (RPMK 40) and at intermediate levels in salivary gland and colon tissues (8-15 RPMK). This low expression of CFTR in lung tissues leads to fewer CFTR proteins to be corrected pharmacologically with existing and future therapies. Therefore methods to increase the amount of CFTR RNA, and thus CFTR protein would increase the pool of \"correctable\" proteins by small molecules.",

Currently we are exploring the \"tunability\" of this synthetic CFTR activation method, to determine if we can predictably control the amount of CFTR RNA produced in different epithelial cell types. These results show an alternative method for CFTR modulation as well as an avenue for better quantitative understanding of CFTR mRNA levels on cellular function. Introduction: Air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of mucociliary differentiated airway epithelial cells are a well-established model to determine CFTR function and CFTR modulator responses. The nasal turbinates are an easy accessible source of airway epithelial cells. However, despite reports using nasal airway epithelial cells (NAECs), the differentiation of these cells in ALI-cultures is less efficient compared to lower airway epithelial cells.

Enhancing surface hydration facilitates airway clearance by improving viscoelastic properties of mucus. Currently, accurate and relevant preclinical models that predict rescue of mucus properties by CF therapeutics are not available. We utilized measurements of viscoelastic mucus properties of nasal and bronchial organoids to predict the outcome of pharmacological treatments, thus offering advanced, translational models for preclinical testing.",

Since the publication of the first CF mouse model in 1992, there have been at least 15 CF mouse models published and utilized by the CF research community to provide new understanding of CF and the ability to test therapeutic strategies in vivo. While all of these CF mouse models have proved useful, conventional gene targeting methods had deficiencies that included the use of selectable markers, affecting Cftr expression, and did not allow for gene targeting on a desired genetic background, leading to a lengthy process. In the last few years, a new gene editing system, CRISPR/Cas, has been utilized to create specific gene mutations faster and without the issues of conventional gene targeting. The aim of this study was to utilize the CRISPR/Cas system to make three common mutations in mouse Cftr to be utilized for in vivo studies by the CF research community.",

Introduction: Mouse models of human disease are powerful tools which enable the study of complex mechanisms and the evaluation of potential novel therapies. Unfortunately the CFTR deficient mouse does not develop spontaneous lung disease. There are two mouse models that result in a CF-like lung disease due to upregulation of ENaC in airway epithelial cells (AEC). It has been hypothesized that ENaC hyperactivity leads to mucus dehydration and accumulation in CF patients. Increased ENaC levels in the lungs, (Mall M, et al. Nat Med. 2004; 10:487-493) and deletion of Nedd4L, the ubiquitin ligase which controls the levels of ENaC on the cell surface in airway epithelial cells (AECs), has been demonstrated to increase levels of ENaC expression which results in cystic fibrosis-like disease (Kimura T, et al. PNAS. 2011; 108; 8:3216-21) . The AEC specific knockout of Nedd4L results in ASL depletion, reduced mucus transport, goblet cell metaplasia and mucus accumulation, massive inflammation, fibrosis and death by 3 weeks of age. We have evaluated an antisense strategy for the establishment of an adult-onset cystic fibrosis mouse model.",

Rationale: Patient-derived model systems are needed to examine activity of modulator agents for CF patients with rare CFTR mutations. Bron-chial epithelial cell models can detect and quantify CFTR function and pharmacologic modulation, but obtaining these cells is invasive. A similar model system from brushed nasal cells is attractive due to the simplicity of sample procurement. We seek to determine the electrophysiological behavior of paired nasal and bronchial cells from CF patients, focusing on modulator impact on CFTR function. Methods: Cells from CF patients were obtained from brushing the 2nd-3rd generation bronchi and the inferior nasal turbinate and cultured on petri dishes with Y-27632 media. Upon reaching confluence, cells were passaged onto collagen-coated inserts and matured in Ultroser-G media. Mature inserts were treated with VX-809 or vehicle for 48-72 hours and studied under voltage clamp conditions. Short circuit currents were monitored in Ussing chambers with baseline currents in symmetric Ringers buffer followed by apical exchange with low [Cl -] buffer and addition of amiloride, forskolin/IBMX, VX-770, and CFTR inh172 (all apical except apical/basolateral forskolin/IBMX).",

            "text": "Supported by CFFT. Cough clearance (CC) is an important airway defense mechanism which enhances the removal of accumulated mucus from our lungs. Clinical studies have revealed that CC is less effective in clearing mucus in people with CF, compared with healthy individuals. However, there is currently a gap in our knowledge of why CC is defective in CF, and what therapeutics can be used to increase CC. Our previous studies have demonstrated that in CF, dysregulation of ion transport (i.e. defective CFTR) leads to airway fluid depletion, mucin hyperconcentration, impaired mucociliary clearance (e.g. collapsed periciliary layer) and adhesion of the mucus to the airway surface layers. Furthermore, the properties of mucus are hypothesized to be heavily influenced by the two major gel forming mucins: MUC5B and MUC5AC. While non-CF and healthy mucus is dominated by MUC5B, clinical studies have shown that MUC5AC expression is up-regulated in CF patients during an acute exacerbation. Therefore, we hypothesized that CC is controlled largely by mucus concentration and is additionally dependent on the relative and absolute amount of MUC5AC. To study the effect of CF-related concentration changes in mucus properties on cough clearance rates, we developed an in vitro cough machine which incorporates well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial cultures within a custom chamber that we used to subject cultures to cough-mimicking airflow velocities up to 35 meters per second. In these studies, we compared the effect of endogenous mucus over a range of mucus concentrations, spanning healthy to CF, as well as with exogenous mucus having different ratios of MUC5B to MUC5AC. The CC of mucus was captured by tracking the movement of particles embedded in the mucus layer with hi-speed camera during 200 millisecond airflow pulses. Our results reveal that CC is critically dependent upon mucus concentration. We found that in healthy (non-CF) mucus, cough produces substantially higher clearance rates of transport than cilia (800 vs. 60 \u03bcm/sec). However, our studies demonstrate that, like cilia-mediated mucus clearance, the ability to clear mucus by cough is also significantly reduced when mucus becomes concentrated in CF. Our studies also showed that MUC5B-dominated mucus is effectively cleared by cough, supporting the hypothesis that MUC5B is important for clearing mucus. However, CC was significantly reduced in MUC5AC-dominated mucus at the same concentration. Finally, from a therapeutic prospective, we have used our novel devices to show that cough clearance can be accelerated by a combination of mucus hydrators (7% hypertonic saline) and reducing agents (DTT). Our results demonstrate the utility of our model system to robustly assay the parameters mediating CC in health, why it fails in disease, and the relative effects of MUC5B and MUC5AC.

The CFTR-G542X mutation is the most common premature termination codon (PTC) in CFTR, and the second most common CF-causing allele. Previously, we showed F670del-Yor1 (Yeast Oligomycin Resistance-1, a member of the ABC gene family) can serve as a useful model for genomewide analysis of modifiers that govern F508del-CFTR biogenesis. The work demonstrated evolutionary conservation of gene-gene interaction between yeast and human, and resulted in discovery of novel targets for improvement of F508del-CFTR misfolding. yor1-G704X results from a mutation in S. cerevisiae homologous to CFTR-G542X, and thus can be used as a phenomic model to identify gene targets for promoting readthrough. We introduced yor1-G704X into the full genomic collection of S. cerevisiae knockout and knockdown (YKO/KD) strains, and performed quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP) to measure growth on oligomycin as an endpoint for nonsense codon suppression. Parallel analysis of the yor1-\u03940 mutant served as a control for effects of YKO-KD mutation on oligomycin sensitivity. G418 (an aminoglycoside readthrough agent) increased oligomycin resistance in the context of Yor1-G704X, but had no effect on the yor1-\u03940 strain. Similarly, the Yor1-G704X-eGFP exhibited increased fluorescence when cultured with G418, supporting use of yor1-G704X for genome-wide screening. Analysis across the complete yeast deletion strain library in concert with Yor1-G704X revealed participants in the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway, NAM7 (UPF1) and UPF3, both of which are known targets for CFTR-G542X readthrough. Overall, we discovered 250 candidate gene targets more potent than UPF3 deletion for inducing full length Yor1. All gene interactions tested thus far by a secondary assay for readthrough (based on Yor1-G704X-eGFP fluorescence) have validated the primary phenotypic results. Additional testing of \"hits\" in combination with each other (epistasis analysis) is in progress. Also ongoing is use of the technology to establish a pharmacogenomics approach for determining genes responsible for effects of readthrough agents. Taken together, the studies describe a powerful new system with application to cystic fibrosis drug discovery. In diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), where normal water, salt, and mucus concentrations are abnormal, the normal mucus layer becomes dehydrated and compresses the periciliary gel layer, collapsing the cilia and preventing normal clearance. The properties of the flowing mucus layer are predicted to be heavily influenced by the two major gel-forming mucins, MUC5B and MUC5AC. Data from cell culture, induced secretions, and animal models suggest that MUC5B forms the basis of the normal flowing gel. However, if the lung is \"irritated\" by allergies, pollutants, and/or infection, MUC5AC levels increase. We hypothesize that cilia-dependent mucus flow and cough clearance are: (1) controlled by differing biophysical properties between the mucus layer and the underlying periciliary gel layer; (2) these differences in biophysical properties are controlled largely by mucus concentration; and (3) the biophysical properties of the mucus layer can be modified by the relative and absolute increase in MUC5AC.",

For this study we have utilized CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of either MUC5AC or MUC5B to generate mono-mucin-producing A549 cells, which normally produce both mucins in nearly equal ratios. Results from Western blots, RT-PCR, sequencing, and mass spectrometry from clonally selected A549 cells confirm mono-mucin production, demonstrating the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing for generating cell models lacking mucin proteins. Mucin collected from the apical washes of these clonally derived cell lines was collected and concentrated. The harvested mucus has been evaluated by a variety of biophysical techniques, including measurements of adhesive and cohesive strength, cough clearance, light scattering and mucociliary clearance. Light scattering demonstrated an approximate 50% reduction in MUC5B or MUC5AC mono-mucin concentration compared to mucin-sufficient cells, consistent with the concept that the mucus produced by A549 cells contains both MUC5AC and MUC5B at nearly equal proportions. A preliminary study evaluating mucus transport on ciliated airway cultures indicates that MUC5B-deficient mucin transports less efficiently than MUC5AC-deficient mucus. Results from these studies will help elucidate the complex relationships between mucus properties and mucin composition, which will ultimately help our understanding of mucus pathogenesis in CF.

HAE provide a means to study disease and mutation-specific questions. HAE (especially human nasal epithelial, HNE) cells are easily acquired from patients with various CFTR mutations. Recent advances allow large-scale expansion of cells without altering the cellular genome, allowing for the establishment of an HNE biobank possible.

Introduction: To determine the effectiveness of a putative CF cell or gene therapy to improve the CFTR ion channel defect in live intact CF mice, we have used a well-established transepithelial potential difference (PD) technique in nasal airways, where mice are oriented vertically to enable placement of the electrode tip into the nares and onto ciliated epithelium. This method used a slow infusion rate (1 \u03bcl/min) of sequential Krebs buffers, with the flow-rate limited largely by the ability of the animal to cope with the fluid volume delivered. We have now assessed a more rapid PD protocol using higher fluid rates, in mice that are nonsurgically intubated to eliminate fluid ingress into the lung.",

We first examined the feasibility of infusion rates of 10, 20 and 50 \u03bcL/min and compared these to our standard 1 \u03bcL/min in the same animal, using normal basal (B) and low chloride (LC) kerb buffers to determine an optimal flow rate. The standard slow infusion rate was then compared to the optimal infusion rate in both normal and CF mice, using the addition of the sodium channel blocker amiloride (A) and the \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol (Iso) in the sequence. Nasal perfusions of B, B+A, LC+A, and LC+A+Iso buffers were performed 1 week apart to allow for complete recovery of the airway epithelium from any physical disturbances that may have occurred due to previous placement of the recording/perfusion cannula.",

The optimal flow rate for rapid and consistently stabilised PD recordings was the 20 \u03bcL/min infusion rate, and this resulted in a typical reduction in PD assessment time from 40 to 10 mins. When tested at this rate, CF mice displayed a significant difference in their nasal PD response for LC+A perfusion: normal mice (Mean +/-SEM: -8.29 +/-1.32 mV) vs CF mice (6.28 +/-0.92 mV, p<0.0001, paired t-test, n=9), a difference maintained irrespective of infusion rate (n.s., paired t-test, n=9). The addition of Iso to LC+A perfusion also demonstrated a significant difference between normal mice (-10 +/-2.56, n=4) and CF mice (-1.19 +/-1.02, n=8, p<0.01, t-test) .",

The response to forskolin of S1251N/F508del monolayers lies between F508del/F508del and R117H/F508del, like with the FIS. However, the sensitivity of the 2D assay seems reduced as compared to FIS. The response to forskolin (10 \u03bcM) of S1251N/F508del (9.02\u03bcA/cm 2 \u00b13.14) is minor compared to R117H, while with the FIS both genotypes respond comparably. Also, we cannot distinguish between wild type and R117H/F508del based on forskolin response (49.41\u03bcA/cm 2 \u00b120.43 and 37.92\u03bcA/cm 2 \u00b120.37). The data suggest that 2D monolayers generated from rectal organoids can be used to study the function of CFTR in Ussing chambers. The current preliminary data suggest that this setup will help to complement FIS studies by allowing the direct study of ion channel activity independent of their coupling to fluid secretion and via the select stimulation of apical or basolateral compartments.

The sweat chloride concentration is still the gold standard for diagnosis of CF.

In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, poor phenotype/genotype correlation for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation has been described with particular regard to the severity of the pulmonary infections. Thus, the identification of non-CFTR genetic variations as contributors of individual risk factors of lung pathology is one of the clinical needs and the challenges ahead in CF. To date, genetic studies in humans are ongoing but they should be joined to other approaches. Recently, a highly geneticallydiverse mouse resource population, the Collaborative Cross (CC), has been generated to mimic the genetic diversity of the human population (http:// csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py). Here, we took advantage of these mouse resources to define host genetic variations that influence the severity of P. aeruginosa lung infection.",

CC mice exhibit distinct disease phenotypes after P. aeruginosa infection ranging from complete resistance to lethal disease and severe pneumonia characterized by high bacterial burden. Most importantly, the differential response to P. aeruginosa infection in CC lines was found to be greater than that reported in classical inbred mice. More detailed analysis on CC mice showed that initial variables including body weight, age and gender have no influence on P. aeruginosa outcome, emphasizing the role of complex genetic traits in the severity of infection. When broad-sense heritability of phenotypic traits was evaluated we confirmed the influence of genetic factors rather than environmental factors among the CC lines during P. aeruginosa infection.",

Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA, USA Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common lifeshortening genetic diseases, is caused by mutation of the CFTR gene, leading to reduced synthesis, function, stability, and/or trafficking of the CFTR protein. CF disease progression is hypothesized to be greatly influenced by the type of CFTR mutation as well as patient demographics such as BMI, pancreatic status, onset of diabetes, and treatment with pancreatic enzymes or insulin. The aim of this analysis was to develop a population pharmacodynamic (PopPD) model in order to evaluate contributing factors influencing disease progression measured as a change in FEV1 in CF subjects.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Using a PopPD model, we were able to describe the time-courses of FEV1 in CF subjects as well as identify factors influencing CF disease progression measured in change of FEV1 over time. The developed model may be used as a tool in clinical practice to predict a change in time-courses of FEV1 for individual CF patients, determining possible risk factors worsening as well as factors improving lung function. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease caused by a defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a membrane-bound anion channel that is permeable to both chloride and bicarbonate. The main features of CF lung disease are bacterial colonization and chronic infection in the conducting airways, which are thought to be due to alterations in the physical and chemical properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL). Pathological and clinical data suggest that the disease is initiated in distal small airways with a diameter <2mm. However, most studies regarding the pathogenesis of CF rely on data from excised or cultured proximal large airways, such as tracheal and bronchi tissue. Thus, there are no direct experimental data to support the dogma that CF lung disease is initiated in distal small airways. Our group has engineered pigs with either a deletion of or mutation of CFTR, which mimics human CF. CF pigs develop spontaneous airway infections, and airways become obstructed with mucus and inflammatory cells. This model provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the spatial origins of CF lung disease. We hypothesize that selective expression of CFTR in distal small airways in vivo prevents development of lung disease in CF pigs. Using a directed evolution strategy both in vitro and in vivo, we have identified a novel adeno-associated virus vector (AAV2H22) with high tropism for both large and small airway epithelial cells. Based on previous studies indicating that small airways have higher surfactant protein D (SPD) expression as compared to large airways, we constructed AAV2H22 vectors to direct expression of eGFP or CFTR to small airway epithelia using a SPD promoter fragment (562bp). There are significantly more GFP + cells in small airway cultures infected with AAV2H22SPD>eG-FP, compared to large airway cultures. Administration of AAV2H22SP-D>eGFP to both trachea and distal small airways in 1-week-old live pigs through bronchoscope confirmed that GFP+ cells were observed in distal small airways, but not in trachea or bronchi in vivo. In addition, there is significantly more cAMP-stimulated short circuit current in CF small airway cultures infected with AAV2H22SPD>hCFTR\u0394R in vitro. Ultimately, these tools will allow us to test our hypothesis in future studies in vivo, which will enhance our understanding of CF lung disease pathogenesis. Congenital absence of the vas deferens is observed as a clinical manifestation in upwards of 99% of males with cystic fibrosis. In this study, we investigated loss of male reproductive structures in the CF rat model, including epididymis and regional involution of the vas. Based on analysis of over 70 CFTR+/+ and -/-male animals ranging from E15.5 to P8, these developmental abnormalities were shown to occur perinatally. Timed matings and histomorphometry were used to establish that CF embryonic Wolffian and Mullerian ducts develop normally until E17.5, after which both structures begin to degenerate. Regional atresia of the vas deferens at the time of birth (and immediately thereafter) was observed, with no indication of luminal mucus or other physical obstruction. Moreover, in contrast to parenchymal damage in human and porcine CF lung and pancreas, no indication of inflammatory cell infiltrate or increased myofibroblast differentiation (as judged by TGF\u03b21 and pSMAD2/3 signaling) were noted in association with involution of the vas. Interestingly, we found that epididymal defects such as diminished smooth muscle proliferation appear to predate loss of the vas deferens. In addition, RNAseq of tissue biopsied from the CF male rat reproductive tract suggests gross alteration of signaling and developmental pathways, including Wnt9b and homeobox-like transcription factors Emx2 and Gata3 (loss of Wnt9b, Emx2, and Gata3 function has been associated previously with destruction of mesonephric duct derivatives in studies of knockout mice). Immunohistochemistry to determine the role of these pathways within the developing rat genitourinary tract, together with studies of androgen receptor signaling and TUNEL assays (to monitor epithelial apoptosis) are in progress. The findings provide an important test of fundamental mechanisms that underlie tissue damage in cystic fibrosis reproductive epithelia, with potential relevance to more generalized exocrine abnormalities in the disease.",

            "text": "(Funded by CFF and NIH.) CF patients harboring rare CFTR mutations or those unresponsive to current pharmaceutical intervention currently have no therapeutic option beyond secondary therapies. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells represent a patient-specific and renewable resource for derivation of tissues affected in CF to serve as a valuable platform for drug discovery and development. Here, we use iPS lines derived from a patient cohort harboring the rare CF-causing mutation c.3700 A>G-CFTR to model drug responses in engineered lung epithelium. This mutation is most prominent in Middle Eastern populations and causes aberrant splicing and deletion of six residues in the nucleotide-binding domain 2 (\u0394I1234_R1239-CFTR) leading to nearly undetectable protein and chloride channel activity. Chronic and acute exposure to VX-809 (lumacaftor) and VX-770 (ivacaftor) respectively -a condition mimicking the combined therapeutic Orkambi TM -significantly rescued the cell surface expression and activity of the \u0394I1234_R1239-CF-TR mutant in overexpression HEK cells as shown by Western blotting and a fluorescence-based assay monitoring membrane potential (FLIPR). We validated the Orkambi TM effect in patient-derived lung epithelium, a study requiring innovation given the inaccessibility of such tissue. iPS cells were generated from an affected individual bearing the c.3700 A>G-CFTR and differentiated into lung epithelium using our published protocol (Wong AP, et al. Nat Protoc. 2015; 10:363-81) . Correction with VX-809 and potentiation with VX-770 led to modest but significant changes in apical, CFTR mediated chloride conduction as measured using FLIPR. Importantly, in a multiwell plate reader assay we ranked the response of this iPSC-derived lung tissue to multimodulators pointing to the utility of this platform for developing personalized treatments for individuals with rare mutations. Future work will utilize CRISPR-Cas9 edited isotypic controls to decipher a patient-specific benchmark for maximum improvement upon correction of the CFTR locus. This work is supported by Al Qamra Holding Inc., CF Canada, and CIHR. The CFTR2 project was established to catalog a diversity of CFTR mutations, and promote discovery of novel \"precision-type\" approaches to therapy. Our laboratory participates in the CF theratyping initiative through development of epithelial cell models encoding clinically relevant mutations on a Fischer Rat Thyroid ((FRT)/Flp-in TM ) background. To date, we have established over 40 isogenic FRT CFTR2 cell lines expressing rare CF alleles from a single chromosomal insertion site-as well as mechanistically important CFTRs intended to improve understanding of both missense and nonsense abnormalities. The FRT lines demonstrate similar levels of CFTR mRNA, and are profiled according to steady-state core and fully glycosylated protein, vectoral ion transport, responsiveness to corrector molecules (VX-809, VX-661), potentiator (VX-770) activity, and more specialized assays tailored to individual CF alleles. Insight from global analysis of CFTR2 mutants will be presented, including observations that: 1) distinct mutations (eg from CFTR classes I, II, and IV) are significantly stabilized by chronic treatment with corrector and potentiator molecules (VX-809 and VX-770), 2) numerous processing mutations (class II) show correction with VX-809, suggesting a shared \"off-pathway\" misfolding intermediate, 3) many gating defects (class III) are potentiated in a manner that correlates strongly with alleles clinically approved for treatment with Kalydeco, 4) conductance mutations (class IV) may exhibit minimal or no response to potentiator (VX-770) therapy, although exceptions exist (eg R117H), and 5) a majority of CFTR mutations display molecular characteristics of more than one traditional subcategory, indicating importance of new methods for reclassifying CFTR2 alleles with a focus on theratype. These findings highlight the significance of cell-based model systems for understanding CF disease pathogenesis, and directing therapeutic trials that will help advance \"precision\" treatment for all individuals with the disease. (Funded by CFF and NIH.) Even though cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by severe and persistent neutrophilic inflammation, the actual role of this phagocyte in the disease pathogenesis is underappreciated. One of the major obstacles impeding the related research is that neutrophils isolated from CF patients are short-lived ex vivo and nonpermissive to genetic manipulation. Taking advantage of the new CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, we are establishing a \u0394F508-CF neutrophil-precursor cell line, from which unlimited CF neutrophils can be differentiated by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induction. A specific sgRNA target sequence on Exon 11 in the human CFTR gene, which covers the F508 site, was identified, synthesized and engineered into the S. pyogenes Cas9 plasmid pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458). The resulting CFTR-sgRNA-Cas9 vector was verified by DNA sequencing. A 127-bp single-stranded DNA oligo was synthesized as the template for homology-directed repair (HDR) for Cas9-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). This oligo, complementary to the nontarget strand of CFTR exon 11 and with 36-bp of homology upstream and 91-bp of homology downstream of the Cas9-induced DSB site, has two modifications: 1) a 3-bp deletion immediately downstream of the DSB site to create the \u0394F508 mutation, and 2) a silent C\u2192T point mutation to create an SspI restriction enzyme cut site 5-bp upstream of the DSB site. To test the principle, HEK-293T cells were transfected with the sgRNA-Cas9 plasmid and the HDR template via calcium phosphate precipitation. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the GFP-positive cells were FACS-sorted and single-cell-cloned by limited dilution. DNA PCR-amplification of the cell clones, followed by SspI analytic digestion and DNA sequencing, confirmed that 1/31 (3.2%) clones had double-allele HDR, and 4/31 (13%) clones had single-allele HDR. To create a designed neutrophil precursor cell line, HL-60 cells were transfected with the CFTR-sgRNA-Cas9 vector plasmid along with the HDR template oligo via electroporation. Twenty-four hours later, the GFP-positive cells were FACS-sorted and single-cell cloned. The HL-60 cell clones are currently under expansion and will be analyzed similarly for HDR. We anticipate that a \u0394F508-CF neutrophil precursor cell line will be established for CF research and drug screening. This work is supported by a CFFT research grant (WANG15XX0). Many CF-causing mutations are rare, and not presently within the scope of the FDA-approved population for CFTR modulator therapy. Currently, the only means to test available CF modulators for ultrarare populations, either potentiator or corrector, that may benefit these sub-populations of patients are costly \"n-of-one\" trials or grouping various CFTR mutations into single study populations, which may be problematic. Recent focus has shifted to ex vivo approaches to address this challenge. Our chosen model is the culture of human sweat glands, which have been highly sensitive to CFTR modulator therapy.",

Chest MRI detected abnormalities in lung structure and perfusion in most infants and preschool children with CF, with airway wall thickening/bronchiectasis (100%) and mucus plugging (50%) constituting the most prevalent morphological abnormalities. In infants and preschool children with CF, the LCI z-score correlated strongly with the MRI morphology score, MRI-defined airway wall thickening/bronchiectasis (P<0.05 to P<0.001) and the MRI global score as a measure that integrates all abnormalities detected by MRI (P<0.05 to P<0.01).

For these subjects, identification of CFTR-restoring drugs is challenging. We developed a functional CFTR assay using patient-derived intestinal stem cells, termed organoids, in which CFTR function and response-to-therapy can be measured easily by the forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay.

Mutations in the CFTR gene form the basis for the clinical manifestations of CF which affects the epithelial innate immune function in the lung. Epithelial dysfunction results in the initiation of a pro-inflammatory cascade in CF airways that leads to the recruitment of leukocytes (1) . Exosomes are nanovesicles (40-100nm) actively secreted by most living cells that contain proteins involved in cell-to-cell signaling.

A high-throughput screening strategy that enriches for small molecules acting on the translated sequence of CFTR mRNA transcript was used to identify a new class of CFTR modulators termed CFTR amplifiers. Data generated in vitro with CFTR amplifiers demonstrated improvement in chloride currents across multiple CFTR mutations and synergy with other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators. Amplifiers are CFTR mutation agnostic and lead to increased levels of immature CFTR protein along with stabilization in CFTR mRNA allowing for more substrate for other CFTR modulators to act upon. PTI-428 is an amplifier currently in Phase I trials designed to determine safety and tolerability in CF subjects and healthy volunteers.",

One therapeutic strategy to enhance clinical benefit in patients with CF who have one or two copies of F508del-CFTR is to combine CFTR correctors that act through different mechanisms to increase CFTR at the cell surface. Using cell-based assays of CFTR function we have identified \"next-generation\" CFTR correctors that are active on their own and additive to first-generation correctors (lumacaftor or VX-661). Extensive medicinal chemistry optimization of the pharmacological activity and drug-like properties led to the discovery of the next-generation CFTR correctors VX-152 and VX-440, which are in early-stage clinical studies.",

Consequently, no functional full-length CFTR protein is generated from PTC mutant genes. For patients with nonsense mutation alleles readthrough-promoting therapeutics are a serious unmet need.

Combined, these activities allow chloride ion transport leading to improved hydration of the lung surface and subsequent enhancement of mucociliary clearance. Abbvie and Galapagos are collaborating to develop a series of compounds capable of performing each of these activities individually.

Chemistry, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA; 3. Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA CF is a lethal autosomal recessive disease in which the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is mutated. The most common mutation in CFTR, \u0394F508, results in 3 primary intracellular defects: inefficient folding in the ER, diminished chloride transport across the apical membrane, and increased lysosomal degradation. There is an FDA-approved combination therapy that alleviates those defects: VX-809 assists proper CFTR folding in the ER and VX-770 enhances the ability of CFTR to efflux chloride at the apical membrane. Combinatorial treatment with VX-809 and VX-770, however, demonstrates modest effects (\u0394FEV 1 = 3%) in homozygous \u0394F508 CF patients and no efficacy in heterozygous patients. Currently, no therapeutics are designed to stabilize CFTR. Rapid lysosomal degradation of mature CFTR is facilitated by the CFTRassociated ligand (CAL), a negative regulator that binds the CFTR C-terminus via a PDZ domain-mediated interaction (Cheng J, et al. J Biol Chem. 2002; 277:3520-9) . To directly address CFTR instability, we engineered a series of synthetic peptide inhibitors of CAL (iCAL) that bind the CAL PDZ domain (CALP) with unprecedented selectivity (Vouilleme L, et al. Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2010; 49:9912-6) . These inhibitors significantly increase \u0394F508 CFTR abundance and conductance at the apical membrane. To determine if our therapeutic leads are amenable to nonproteinogenic amino acid substitutions, we substituted acetylated lysine residues at modulatory sites along iCAL without ablating its target affinity. We crystallized each peptide in complex with CALP and determined structure complexes at resolutions \u2264 1.55 \u00c5 (Amacher JF, et al. PLoS One. 2014; 9:e103650) . From these data, we hypothesized that the incorporation of complex, unnatural side-chains in iCAL will enhance its affinity and selectivity towards CALP. We utilized high-throughput in silico modeling to identify putative modifications that, when coupled to modulatory lysine residues, will enhance the affinity between our iCAL peptidomimetics and CALP. We performed fluorescence polarization competition assays to determine inhibition constants (K I ) between CALP and each modified peptide. Among the peptides investigated, we observed a 2-to 3-fold increase in affinity between CALP and iCAL (K I \u2248 20-30 \u03bcM) relative to the unmodified peptide, indicating a moderate-to-weak interaction. Furthermore, we subjected these peptidomimetics to crystallographic analysis to understand potential mechanisms by which these modifications enhance affinity towards CALP. These experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of synthetic side-chain modifications at modulatory sites can enhance the binding affinity between CALP and iCAL. Extending this experimental workflow to other iCAL sites will greatly expand the chemical diversity available to explore in order to enhance the affinity and selectivity of our therapeutic leads. A selective, highly potent iCAL therapeutic, administered in conjunction with Orkambi, could attenuate mutant CFTR defects and augment treatment efficacy in a broader spectrum of CF patients. This work was supported in part by NIH award R01-DK101451. Background: RNA editing is an enzymatic process that initiates site-directed mutagenesis within RNAs. This process is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), a family of enzymes that convert adenosines (A's) to inosines (I's) in various RNAs. I is structurally similar to guanosine (G) and an A-to-I change is interpreted as an A-to-G change by ribosomes and other biological processes. As a result of this mechanism, protein function may be altered, particularly if editing occurs within mRNA coding regions. In our lab, we have engineered a recombinant ADAR that guides the editing reaction to a specific adenosine of our choosing within an RNA. Using this site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) strategy, we have attempted to correct the most common premature termination stop codons (PTCs) in CFTR in transiently transfected HEK293T cells.",

The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA Viral vector delivered cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) can complement the anion channel defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelia. Indeed, gene therapy is a curative strategy regardless of the disease-causing mutation. An important goal for CF gene therapy is to achieve long-term functional correction. While many vector options have been evaluated, integrating vectors have the greatest potential to maintain stable expression over time without a requirement for repeated administration. In this study, functional in vivo CFTR channel activity was restored in the airways of CF pigs using two integrating vector options: 1) a lentiviral vector; and 2) a hybrid piggyBac/AAV vector. In freshly excised tracheal and bronchus tissues and cultured sinus cells, we observed a significant increase in transepithelial cAMP-stimulated current, evidence of functional CFTR. In addition, we observed increases in tracheal airway surface liquid (ASL) pH and bacterial killing in CFTR vector-treated animals. In cultured airway epithelial cells from treated pigs, we observed increased ASL pH and decreased mucus viscosity. A third vector system based on an integrating hybrid piggyBac/adenoviral vector is currently being evaluated. Lentiviral vectors are a vetted option for CF gene therapy; whereas, the emerging technologies of DNA transposon-based hybrid vectors provide new tools for in vivo gene transfer and present an exciting opportunity to increase the delivery efficiency for therapeutic genes such as CFTR. Our results demonstrate that CFTR delivery using integrating viral vectors can partially correct the anion channel defect in a large animal CF model and validate a translational strategy to treat or prevent CF lung disease. Background: Inflammation and infection begins during early infancy in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), but little is known regarding the genes or pathways contributing to this pathophysiology or if they differ according to age.

Gene expression profiling provides insight into pathways of innate and adaptive immunity disrupted in CF that may be future prognostic indicators or targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by different mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). One of the most common of the mutation classes, premature termination codons (PTCs) in CFTR results in nonfunctional CFTR protein and causes ~11% of CF-causing alleles. Previously, we have screened for clinically available compounds that efficiently enhance translational readthrough of PTCs and improve CFTR function. Among the 8 lead compounds from the screen, escin, an herbal extract, has consistently been shown to enhance the CFTR activity in nonsense-mutation-expressing FRT and HBE cells. In the current study, we examined the role of escin in CFTR cell surface expression and evaluated its bioavailability in mice.",

Monolayers were treated with escin (10 \u03bcM), positive control (G418, 250 \u03bcg/mL) or vehicle control (DMSO) for 48 hours followed by measurement of chemiluminescence activity. The pharmacokinetic properties of escin were investigated in mice following intraperitoneal (IP) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of escin and the mean plasma concentrations were analyzed using noncompartmental analysis.",

Results were confirmed by Western blot. Escin levels in mice plasma showed two peaks, which corresponded to two known and active isomers of escin, escin Ia and escin Ib. The concentrations of escin Ia, escin Ib, and total escin (Ia + Ib) over time were lower in SC dosing compared to IP administration, and were nearly undetectable with oral administration (unique to mice since it has been shown that humans readily absorb escin). Mean peak concentrations of escin Ia (10,257 ng/mL), escin Ib (7,123 ng/mL), and total escin (17,380 ng/mL) were observed at 4 hours after SC dosing. AUC last values were 130 h.\u03bcg/mL for escin Ia, 84.7 h.\u03bcg/ mL for escin Ib, and 215 h.\u03bcg/mL for total escin Ia + Ib, demonstrating stable levels above the maximally effective concentration in vitro and suitable for in vivo studies.",

Escin is bioavailable by IP administration in mice at levels sufficient to mimic desired human exposures achieved PO. The efficacy of escin in transgenic hG542X-CFTR-expressing mice is currently in progress, which will set the stage to conduct clinical trials in CF patients with nonsense mutations. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel. Airway disease is the major source of morbidity and mortality. Successful implementation of gene-and cell-based therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease requires knowledge of relationships between percentages of targeted cells, levels of CFTR expression, correction of electrolyte transport, and rescue of host defense defects. Previous studies suggested that when ~20-50% of airway epithelial cells expressed CFTR, they generated wild-type levels of Clsecretion, and overexpressing CFTR offered no advantage compared to endogenous expression levels. However, recent discoveries focused attention on CFTR-mediated HCO 3 secretion and airway surface liquid (ASL) pH as critical for host defense and CF pathogenesis. Therefore, we generated porcine airway epithelia with varying ratios of CF and wild-type cells. Epithelia with a 50:50 mix secreted HCO 3 at half the rate of wild-type epithelia. Likewise, heterozygous epithelia (CFTR +/or CFTR +/\u0394F508 ) expressed CFTR and secreted HCO 3 at ~50% of wildtype values. ASL pH, antimicrobial activity, and viscosity showed similar relationships to the amount of CFTR. Overexpressing CFTR increased HCO 3 secretion to rates greater than wild-type, but ASL pH did not exceed wild-type values. Thus, in contrast to Clsecretion, the amount of CFTR is rate-limiting for HCO 3 - secretion and for correcting host defense defects. In addition, overexpressing CFTR might produce a greater benefit than expressing CFTR at wild-type levels when targeting small fractions of cells. These findings may also explain the risk of airway disease in CF carriers.",

Moreover, in mutant mice we observe a 20% iNOS+ granulocyte subpopulation that is absent in normal mice (n=6). Importantly, the ratio of the pro-inflammatory macrophage-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) to conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is twofold higher in mutant mice (n=16, P<0.01). Two weeks after acute intranasal challenge with bacterial toxins (LPS-fMLP) we observe high levels of inducible mucin (mMU-C5AC) and pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFN\u03b3, IL12p70, TNF\u03b1 and KC by ELISA (n=7; P<0.01) in mutant compared to normal. Oral application of a S1P-lyase inhibitor (LX2931), increases S1P levels in mutant mouse tissues more than tenfold. This normalizes the lung MoDC/cDC ratio, and strongly reduces B-and T-cell counts and granulocyte iNOS expression in unchallenged mutant mice.

Cluster analysis distinguished CF from non-CF patients based notably on markers of oxidative stress, even when neutrophil counts and bacterial load did not differ between the two groups. This suggests that CF patients have specific characteristics with respect to bioactive lipid profiles, irrespective of the level of airway inflammation. Using the Fisher correlation test, we identified 27 lipid species with a significant correlation (R 2 > 0.5, P<0.05) to PRAGMA CT scores. From these data emerged two clusters (sphingosine and phospholipase A pathways) that correlate with high disease scores.

The sinuses system represents a P. aeruginosa reservoir affecting lower airways system. Early diagnosis and follow-up of the ENT complications of CF, such as mucoceles and polyposis, are important in order to treat them. Currently maxillo-facial CT is the most used radiological exam for the follow-up of CF patients with sinonasal complications; however radiation exposure in these patients is a well known issue. Cone-beam CT scan (CBCT) is currrently used in maxillo-facial surgery, expecially developed for 3D reconstruction with a lower radiation exposure. In order to reduce radiation damage without losing clinical information, an experimental protocol, featuring cone beam CT (CBCT), is currently in progress in our center for the ENT follow-up of CF patients.",

Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Significant morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF) results from chronic lung inflammation, most commonly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Recent data suggest that IL-17 contributes to pathological inflammation in the setting of abnormal mucosal immunity, and type-17 immunity driven inflammatory responses may represent a novel target to block aberrant inflammation in CF. Indeed, our transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq on the airway epithelium from CF patients who underwent clinical bronchoscopy revealed a dramatic upregulation of IL-17 downstream signature genes, implicating a significant contribution of IL-17 mediated immunity in CF lungs. Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) chromatin modulators can regulate T cell responses, specifically Th17 mediated inflammation, by mechanisms that include bromodomain-dependent inhibition of acetylated histones at the IL17 locus. Here we show that, in vitro, BET inhibition potently suppressed Th17 cell responses in explanted CF tissue and inhibited IL-17 driven chemokine production in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) cells. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus lung infection murine models, BET inhibition decreased inflammation without exacerbating bacterial or fungal infection, suggesting that BET inhibition may be an effective and safe therapeutic approach in treating lung inflammation in CF patients.

Pulmonary, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Med Ctr, Lebanon, NH, USA Introduction: Regional differences in resident lung macrophage (LM\u03c6) responsiveness to hypoxia may be an important factor in the development of bronchiectatic lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). It is not yet known if the regional variation in CF-related lung disease is due to differences in microbial pathogens, variation in the host response to infection, or a combination of the two. An increased understanding of this regional variation may aid in the discovery of interventions that will slow the progression of lung disease (Hogan DA, et al. PLoS One. 2016; 11:e0149998) . MicroR-NAs are ubiquitous regulators of human biology. Much optimism exists for microRNAs as biomarkers in cancer and lung disease (Vencken SF, et al. Thorax. 2015; 70:501-3.) Recent clinical and cell-based studies have revealed CF-specific alterations in miRNA expression, hence it follows that modulating miRNA expression in vivo looks very appealing for developing new CF therapies. The possibility that miRNAs may act as phenotype modifiers and that they could be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers warrants investigation (Noel S, Leal T. 2015. In: Cystic Fibrosis in the Light of New Research). Our work here seeks to identify LM\u03c6 -derived microRNAs and distinguish regional differences associated with oxygen stress comparing alternate lobes of the lung.",

Of the top 100 microRNAs expressed, fourteen miRNAs were differentially expressed RLL vs RUL including: miR-361-5p, miR-378g, miR-423-5p (up in RLL and down in RUL), and miR-107, miR-511-5p, miR-99a-5p (down in RLL and up in RUL).

The rates of PEx suggest an increase over time and were highest among adults and those with advanced disease based on lung function, consistent with a progressive disease. Introduction: Intestinal inflammation is now recognized as a manifestation of cystic fibrosis (CF). The majority of studies in gut inflammation have utilized stool calprotectin as a biomarker of inflammation, with numerous studies reporting significant elevations in stool calprotectin compared to healthy controls. Stool calprotectin levels have been reported to correlate with growth and quality of life questionnaire scores. Ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator that has been shown to improve lung function and reduce pulmonary exacerbations. Ivacaftor has also been associated with considerable weight gain, which may not be solely explained by improved pulmonary status. An improvement in gastrointestinal physiology has been speculated as an alternative explanation. Normalization of intestinal pH and histopathology have been observed while on ivacaftor but its effects on intestinal inflammation have not been fully established. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether ivacaftor reduces intestinal inflammation in patients with CF.",

We have evaluated an antisense strategy for the treatment of CF by inhibiting the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). It has been demonstrated that ENaC hyperactivity leads to mucus dehydration and accumulation in CF patients and increased ENaC levels in lung result in cystic fibrosis-like disease in mice. Mouse models of CF were generated by overexpression of ENaC (Mall M, et al. Nature Med. 2004; 10:487-93) or by deletion of Ned-d4L, the ubiquitin ligase which controls the levels of ENaC on the cell surface in airway epithelial cells (AECs) and has been demonstrated to increase levels of ENaC expression (Kimura T, et al.

RNA levels for mucus markers, including Gob5, FOXa3, SPDEF, AGR2 and MUC5B, were all significantly increased by Nedd4L ASO treatment. Aerosol delivery of ENaC ASOs produced dose-responsive mRNA reduction of ENaC in AECs.

( The most common mutation in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), F508del, interferes with transport of the CFTR protein to the cell surface and impairs chloride channel function, leading to disruption of fluid balance in epithelial tissues, most notably the lung. Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), which are, paradoxically, overactive in CF, are one of the primary proteins responsible for fluid balance in the lung and appear to be partially regulated by CFTR. Thus, CFTR dysfunction may contribute to excessive intracellular sodium transport via ENaC and, secondarily, excessive H 2 O absorption.",

In Western blot studies, 24-hour treatment with 3 \u03bcM VX-661 either alone or in combination with 100 nM ivacaftor improved the cellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR as determined by an increase in the mature glycosylated CFTR. In Ussing chamber studies using F508del/F508del-HBE cells derived from six donors, 24-hour treatment with VX-661 alone enhanced chloride transport from a baseline of 2.5% to 8.1% of normal levels with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 516 \u00b1 42 nM. Co-treatment (24 hours) with 0.1 \u03bcM ivacaftor and 3 \u03bcM VX-661 further enhanced chloride transport to 15.7% of non-CF airway cells. A minimal response to ivacaftor monotherapy was observed, which is consistent with little-to-no F508del-CFTR at the cell surface in the absence of VX-661. 72-hour treatment of cultured F508del/F508del-HBE cells with 3 \u03bcM VX-661 and 0.1 \u03bcM ivacaftor also increased fluid transport and ciliary beat frequency to levels greater than those observed with either agent alone. These in vitro data demonstrate that the combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor provides improvement of chloride transport, fluid transport, and ciliary beat frequency in F508del/F508del-HBE cells. This combination was also explored in a panel of cells expressing different mutant CFTR forms, including mutant CFTR forms associated with severe or moderate defects in processing and trafficking, defects in channel gating activity or residual chloride transport. Overall, these in vitro data demonstrated that the combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor improved chloride transport more than either agent alone in cells expressing a wide range of mutant CFTR forms. VX-661 has a favorable preclinical pharmacokinetic profile with low clearance, high oral bioavailability, and good distribution into target tissues. Risk of drug-drug interactions with VX-661 is small since it does not inhibit or induce any major cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro.",

Introduction: Maintenance of adequate airway surface liquid (ASL) and proper functioning of the mucociliary transit (MCT) system in the pathophysiology of CF airway disease is well understood, but until recently these parameters have been impossible to measure in live animals. Our goal is to noninvasively assess ASL and MCT as an outcome measure for developing genetic and pharmaceutical CF airway treatments, and we have developed synchrotron x-ray imaging methods to enable monitoring of these measures of airway surface health. Our methods were developed in mice at the SPring-8 Synchrotron in Japan, but we plan to transition to larger animal models with a view to future use in CF animals. Technique translation to the larger Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) x-ray beam at the Australian Synchrotron has begun.

Additionally, current radiographic techniques employed to image the lung require the use of ionizing radiation, which limits the translation to young children and hampers repetitive use of these measures over time. The use of inhaled gas as a contrast agent has greatly improved the suitability of MRI techniques for pulmonary imaging.

Background: Computed tomography studies of infants with CF reveal that progressive structural lung disease is present much earlier than symptoms. Unfortunately, we are severely limited in the tools available to safely evaluate the youngest patients, hampering our clinical ability to intervene on these patients and prevent irreversible damage. Even low-dose CT is of limited utility in this radiation-sensitive population. Digital chest tomosynthesis (DCT) is a commercially available imaging technique that reconstructs image slices from an acquisition of a series of projection images into a pseudo-3D image. The in-plane resolution of DCT can be higher than that of CT, at a significantly lower radiation dose. Scan times, unfortunately, are 5 to 15 seconds, well beyond the normal respiratory cycle of a young patient. We have developed a stationary digital chest tomosynthesis system (s-DCT), which utilizes a stationary gantry with multiple, independently activated x-ray focal spots based on carbon nanotube (CNT) x-ray technology. The key advantage of the system is the potential to perform gated x-ray imaging in which projections can be acquired synchronized to the patient's respiratory cycle. The goal of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the s-DCT system against conventional radiography in adult and pediatric CF patients.",

Nebulization studies supported the conclusion that the maximum feasible dose was delivered during GLP toxicology. The toxicology batch was manufactured at a scale representing as much as 57,000 doses of the potential human dose. In CF patients, the lack of a proper functioning CFTR causes a chronic lung infection that is difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common and particularly virulent pathogen that can cause a significant level of morbidity and mortality. Intracellular bacterial colonization of P. aeruginosa in macrophages, mast cells or epithelial cells is particularly difficult to eradicate with antibiotics, even with those that are cell-permeable. Autophagy is a catabolic process that cells use to degrade various defective proteins/foreign pathogens and convert them into useful cellular building blocks such as amino acids and lipids. In CF, it is known that autophagy is impaired and this can further compromise the patient's ability to clear the chronic lung infection. Autophagy activation enables an alternative mechanism to clear the bacterial infection out of cells; and therefore, could potentially be useful when used in combination with anti-infective agents. The fatty acid cysteamine conjugate CAT-5571 is a new chemical entity that can activate autophagy in cultured primary homozygous F508del human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells at concentrations as low as 0.3 \u03bcM. In an in vitro study involving hBE cells that had been infected with P. aeruginosa, a significant reduction in the intracellular bacterial load was observed when cells were pretreated with CAT-5571. The reduction in the CFU was comparable to that observed when similarly infected hBE cells were treated with cytochalasin D, a cell-permeable antibiotic. The bacterial clearance was demonstrated first in an in vivo study using female BALB/c mice that were dosed orally with CAT-5571 for 3.5 days prior to infection with a lethal challenge of P. aeruginosa. CAT-5571 was then evaluated in a chronic P. aeruginosa infection model involving gut-corrected CF F508del/ F508del mice. In this in vivo model of CF lung infection and inflammation, treatment with CAT-5571 resulted in a decrease in bacterial load (82506 \u00b1 36048 without drug to 1657 \u00b1 1406 with drug, n = 7). Although there was no difference in the total white blood cell count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, there was a shift away from neutrophils (26.44 \u00b1 10 versus 8 \u00b1 3, n \u2265 6) and increased number of macrophages (71 \u00b1 29 versus 89 \u00b1 9, n \u2265 6) all parameters p<0.05, using the analysis of variance between vehicle and CAT-5571 treated animals. CAT-5571 represents a potential new therapeutic for the treatment of CF. The key exposure parameters, AUC and C trough , were substantially enhanced for CTP-656 relative to ivacaftor. The half-life for CTP-656 was approximately 15 hours, supporting development of CTP-656 as a once-daily treatment for cystic fibrosis patients with gating mutations. As part of the Phase 1 clinical development program, the safety, tolerability and steady-state PK profile following multiple-dose administration of CTP-656 was characterized.",

Based on the known pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic relationship for ivacaftor, the repeat dose study with CTP-656 has provided the necessary data to select potentially effective doses for a Phase-2 clinical trial in patients with gating mutations. Recombinant human DNase I enzymatically cleaves extracellular DNA in the sputa of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, hence, reducing sputum viscoelasticity that accumulates in the lungs of these patients and enabling better sputum expectoration. Actin, a potent inhibitor of DNase I, is found in high concentration in CF patients' sputum and may decrease the enzyme's DNA degradation activity therefore interfering with the effectiveness of inhaled DNase I in the lungs of CF patients. In order to reduce the actin-DNase I interaction and the subsequent inhibition of DNase I activity, Protalix has developed an Actin-Inhibition-Resistant DNase I, or AIR-DNase, by chemically modifying the enzyme. AIR-DNase is Protalix's proprietary, chemically-modified plant cell-expressed recombinant human DNase I, produced in tobacco BY2 cells, and is under development for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis, to be administered by inhalation.",

Background: High levels of inflammation are associated with chronic inflammatory and immune mediated conditions such as CF. CF is associated with exaggerated and prolonged inflammation in the lungs, which contributes to lung injury, fibrosis and loss of lung function. When pulmonary infection is apparent in the CF airways, the adaptive and innate immune response is disproportionate and dysregulated. Even in the absence of clinically apparent infection there is often evidence of inflammation in the CF airways. CF patients show elevated levels of neutrophils in the lung, which have increased neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase activity. CF macrophages display spontaneous and exaggerated pulmonary infiltration, and are polarized into the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype and to a lesser extent into the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Cells of the adaptive immune system, such as T lymphocytes are more abundant in CF airways and produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally an imbalance of T lymphocyte subsets may have an important role in the CF inflammatory response. Therapeutic regimens for CF generally involve management of symptoms in an attempt to slow the progression of the disease. However, it is the repeated cycles of inflammation, injury and fibrosis that cause the chronic, life-threatening manifestations that ultimately lead to respiratory failure. Thus, therapies that can target this inflammatory environment and disrupt the destructive cycle of infection, inflammation and fibrosis would have a major impact in preventing the progression of lung disease.

Omalizumab did not seem to improve the course of ABPA. PEx rate was higher than expected. In this small series CFRD and male gender seemed to be associated with a worse ABPA disease course. We conclude decrease in serum IgE during omalizumab treatment was not associated with clinical improvement. Further studies are needed to determine the role of omalizumab in ABPA. Background: The multiple breath washout (MBW) test has advantages over traditional lung function tests, especially for young children with cystic fibrosis (CF). While the MBW test does not require active cooperation from subjects, accurate interpretation of MBW outcomes requires technically correct test performance. To facilitate a standardized approach to the measurement and interpretation of MBW outcomes, MBW core centers have been developed. These MBW centers provide standardized training and certification of MBW operators, supportive feedback, as well as central over-reading of MBW data collected for interventional studies. Here we summarize the experience of the MBW center in Toronto.",

Changes in health demographics and treatment thresholds since publication of the Fuchs definition, and changes in the demographics of patients volunteering for CF clinical trials, have resulted in an overall reduction in use of IV antibiotic treatments for exacerbations in clinical trials. Both the expanded and modified Fuchs exacerbation definitions have been developed in response to these changes. The expanded definition differs from the original in that any oral, inhaled, and/or IV antibiotics may be used in response to the presence of \u22654 signs and symptoms, and the modified Fuchs definition requires only the presence of \u22654 Fuchs signs and symptoms, irrespective of treatment.

Introduction: Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a serine protease released from the azurophilic granules in leukocytes (or neutrophils). Its primary role is to assist in the proteolytic breakdown and destruction of phagocytosed foreign pathogens as part of the normal immune response. However, secreted active NE has been implicated in contributing to a range of inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). ProAxsis has developed a range of ProteaseTags \u00ae which are able to rapidly and selectively bind to active proteases. The incorporation of such ProteaseTags \u00ae within activity-dependent immunoassays enables the quantification of active proteases within biological samples and has resulted in the recent commercialisation of our ProteaseTag \u00ae Active Neutrophil Elastase Immunoassay.",

            "text": "Conclusion: We report the application of a novel ProteaseTag \u00ae , NE Ultra, as an irreversible inhibitor and potent ABP for NE. This affinity label has a number of advantages over other commercially available irreversible NE inhibitors such as MeOSuc-AAPV-CH 2 Cl, in terms of improvements in stability and selectivity as well as the ability to visualise active NE in clinical samples, when used in combination with a streptavidin-conjugate. NE Ultra has therefore the potential for broad application across laboratory-based CF research. Background: CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an ion channel that regulates the airway surface liquid (ASL). In the current paradigm, the absence of functional CFTR leads to a decreased ASL pH (Coakley RD, et al. PNAS. 2003; 100:16083-8) and reduces ciliary beat frequency (Clary-Meinesz C, et al. ERJ. 1998; 11:330-3) , increases mucus viscosity (Matsui H, et al. JCI. 1998; 102:1125-31) , and impairs innate immunity (Pezzulo AA, et al. Nature. 2012; 487:109-13) . We hypothesize that nebulized NaHCO 3 will restore ASL pH and improve airway function in CF. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of inhaled NaHCO 3 as assessed by pulmonary function and effects on the airway pH in patients with CF.",

Only 1 of 37 patients discontinued administration due to bronchospasm. NaHCO 3 inhalation was associated with a decrease in FEV 1 , similar to what has been observed with other inhaled hypertonic agents (Robinson M, et al. ERJ. 1999; 14:678-85) . The low sample size limited our ability to definitively assess changes in EBC and sputum pH. Further investigations are necessary to assess whether long-term inhaled NaHCO 3 improves lung function in CF. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, the most frequent of which is F508del-CFTR. CF is characterized by hyper-secretion of proinflammatory chemokines into the airway lumen. Consequently this induces the highly inflammatory cellular phenotype typical of CF, and subsequent fibrosis causing airway destruction, leading to morbidity and mortality. We have previously reported that miR-155 is up-regulated in cystic fibrosis lung epithelial cells. However, the molecular mechanism by which miR-155 regulates the manifestations of the disease phenotype of CF is not well understood. Here we report that the regulatory associated protein of mTOR, complex 1 (RPTOR) is a novel target of miR-155 in CF lung epithelial cells. The suppression of RPTOR expression and subsequent activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling resulted in the induction of fibrosis by up-regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in CF lung epithelial cells. Thus, we propose that miR-155 can regulate fibrosis of CF lungs through the RPTOR-TGF\u03b2-CTGF axis. These mechanisms are potential targets for CF therapy. is characterized by small airway mucus obstruction that is associated with accelerated loss of lung function and mortality. Cigarette smoking causes reduced cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity and enhanced mucus expression, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance. Patients with COPD without CFTR mutations have reduced CFTR activity that is independently associated with chronic bronchitis. The CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor, is approved for CF and also augments the function of wild-type CFTR, including airway epithelium with acquired CFTR dysfunction. To test whether CFTR potentiation might be helpful in COPD, we conducted a pilot study to determine the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis.",

            "text": "Sponsored by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated. a Lung function, calculated using the Global Lungs Initiative equation, was not calculable for all patients. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by an ion channel abnormality that produces airway surface liquid (ASL) volume depletion and mucus hyperconcentration, resulting in thick, adherent airway mucus plugs that are resistant to mucociliary and cough clearance. Experimentally, ASL depletion and mucus hyperconcentration have been generated in Scnn1b-transgenic (Scnn1b-Tg) mice by airway-targeted overexpression of the epithelial Na + channel \u03b2 subunit (\u03b2ENaC, encoded by the Scnn1b gene). Expression of the Scnn1b transgene causes airway surface dehydration with a consequent increase in mucus concentration, which leads to osmotic compression of cilia and mucus adhesion. Lung pathology in Scnn1b-Tg mice is characterized by airway mucus obstruction, inflammation, and susceptibility to spontaneous bacterial infections, recapitulating the main features of CF lung disease. The importance of hyperconcentrated mucus in the pathophysiology of CF lung disease led us to use the Scnn1b-Tg mouse as an in vivo model to test the efficacy of various mucus-mobilizing agents. Our efforts have focused on the action of reducing agents, based on the rationale that reducing the molecular weight (MW) of mucin polymers by cutting intermolecular disulphide-bonds is predicted to: 1) reduce the viscous and elastic moduli of mucus gels, and 2) increase the ability of mucins to diffuse out of swelling gels, thus aiding transport of mucus plugs out of the lung. Preliminary experiments were performed using a nose-only aerosol delivery system adapted to deliver very small volumes (\u226410 \u03bcL/min) of polydisperse particles (\u2264 4 \u03bcm). Analysis of aerosol deposition fraction using 200 nm fluorescent latex beads indicated that less than 0.05% of the total number of beads in the generator were deposited in the lung of wildtype (WT, C57BL/6N) mice. Nonetheless, agarose Western blot analysis of BAL harvested from Scnn1b-Tg or WT mice after aerosolization of a single dose of a proprietary reducing agent (Rx) indicated a significant decrease (~50%) in high MW Muc5b polymers, as compared to mice aerosolized with iso-osmotic vehicle. As mucus plugs in Scnn1b-Tg mice airway are easily detectable histologically, the effect of Rx treatment was also assessed morphometrically (intraluminal AB-PAS positive area). We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in studies involving aerosolization of Rx to Scnn1b-Tg mice, where we observed a dose-dependent reduction in the lung mucus content (i.e., vehicle 0.188 \u00b1 0.025 mm 2 /lung n=21; ~5 mM deposited Rx 0.162 \u00b1 0.023 mm 2 /lung n=8; ~10 mM deposited Rx 0.059 \u00b1 0.012 mm 2 /lung n=9 mean \u00b1 SEM). Notably, preliminary experiments testing the efficacy of the benchmark mucolytic N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suggest that this compound, dosed at the same concentration as active Rx (10 mM), is ineffective at promoting mucus plug clearance in Scnn1b-Tg mice, mirroring poor efficacy of NAC in the clinic. Cumulatively, these data indicate that we have developed a clinically relevant platform to perform initial testing for efficacy/toxicity of mucus-mobilizing agents. Introduction: Progressive lung disease due to mucociliary dysfunction remains a problem in cystic fibrosis (CF). Inflammation usually associated with CF airway disease reduces chloride secretion by a decrease in BK conductance that otherwise provides the driving force for secretion. Thus, anti-inflammatory CF therapy is an important of CF care. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have potent anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated the effects of losartan on mucociliary dysfunction in vitro and in vivo.",

Thus, VDP could be a marker of early lung disease in CF and could provide a sensitive, radiation-free modality to monitor the progression and response to treatment in these patients. Pulmonary inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with an exaggerated neutrophilic response which leads to lung damage and subsequent respiratory failure. Effective treatment of the underlying chronic inflammation is needed. Activin A is a key modulator of the inflammatory cascade and its levels correlate with reduced respiratory function in CF patients (Hardy CL, et al. Immunol Cell Biol. 2015; 93:567-74) . Follistatin, a naturally occurring glycoprotein, is an effective inhibitor of activin activity. Its effect on modulating inflammation in CF was assessed using Scnn1b-Tg mice, which recapitulate the hallmarks of CF lung disease and exhibit elevated activin A levels in lung tissue.",

            "text": "Supported by the Belgian CF Foundation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder amongst Caucasians. CF is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys and intestine. Long-term issues include difficulty in breathing and coughing up sputum, resulting in extracellular DNA accumulation in the sputum and frequent lung infections. Patients exhibit lung disease consistent with failure of the innate airway defense mechanisms. Mucus represents the main barrier between the airway epithelium and the external environment and is, thus, the primary defense mechanism of the airways. Airway mucus dehydration seems paramount in the initiation of CF lung disease. Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Recombinant human DNase I enzymatically cleaves extracellular DNA in the sputa of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, hence, reducing sputum viscoelasticity that accumulates in the lungs of these patients, thus enabling better sputum expectoration. Actin, a potent inhibitor of DNase I activity, is found in high concentration in CF patients' sputum and may decrease the enzyme's DNA degradation activity therefore interfering with the effectiveness of inhaled DNase I in the lungs of CF patients. Protalix has developed a chemically modified plant cell-expressed Actin-Inhibition-Resistant DNase I, or AIR-DNase, to be administered by inhalation. This is a report of the results of a phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose and multiple-ascending-dose study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of inhaled AIR DNase in 18 healthy volunteers, and an interim report of a phase IIa, proof-of-concept, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exploratory efficacy parameters of AIR DNase\u2122 in patients with cystic fibrosis previously treated with Pulmozyme\u00ae. Background: GLPG2222 (GLPG2222/ABBV-2222) is a novel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector in clinical development for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). In cellular assays, GLPG2222 was shown to be a potent corrector, partially restoring F508del CFTR cell surface expression when using a CFBe41o-cell line harbouring HRP-tagged F508del CFTR. In primary bronchial epithelial cells derived from patients homozygous for F508del, the combination of GLPG2222 and a CFTR potentiator restores the function of F508del CFTR and exhibits potent activity with an EC 50 <10nM. GLPG2222 represents one component of a future potentiator/corrector(s) combination therapy targeting a broad CF patient population.",

Pooling of BAL offers the opportunity to gather a homogenous sample of greater volume with a greater representation of the proximal airway component.

OSCNdisturbs the cell machinery while LF either acts as iron chelator and/or by direct interaction with bacterial membranes. The combined effects of OSCN -/ bovine LF (bLF) may offer an innovative multitarget strategy to fight resistant pathogens.",

Assessment of inflammation in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) is most interesting but lower airway sampling by BAL is limited by invasiveness. In CF upper airway mucosa equally reveals defective CFTR channels, frequently causing chronic rhinosinusitis in CF.

Introduction: CFTR affects electrolyte transport in many organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) system, resulting in pancreatic insufficiency, nutritional malabsorption, and significant reductions in GI motility, altering the fecal microbiota and causing mucus adhesion. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) and meconium ileus (MI) due to highly viscous and adhesive intestinal mucus affect many CF patients and cause substantial morbidity and decreased quality of life. We previously showed that the novel and unique biopolymer poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG15A), a polycationic polysaccharide that inter-digitates with human mucus and interacts with purified mucin to normalize their structure, decreased the viscosity, elasticity, and adhesivity of CF airway mucus, substantially improving mucociliary transport. We have also shown that a related polymer, PAAG11D, prevented the incidence of DIOS in CFTR -/mice, significantly improving survival and growth. We have turned to the CFTR -/rat to investigate whether PAAG11D can prevent the development of DIOS and also treat documented obstruction.

In-frame premature termination codons (PTCs) comprise 11% of all disease-associated mutations. Translation of PTC-harboring mRNAs generates truncated proteins that are unstable and/or lack normal function. Drugs have been identified that suppress translation termination at a PTC to restore full-length protein (also referred to as readthrough of the PTC). A subset of aminoglycosides has been shown to induce PTC readthrough, but the amount of full-length protein generated by these drugs has not been sufficient to correct the phenotype of many diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, aminoglycoside toxicity limits their long-term clinical use. In addition, PTCs also frequently elicit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD is a conserved mRNA surveillance pathway that preferentially degrades PTC-containing mRNAs, thereby diminishing the pool of mRNAs available for translation and PTC readthrough. Most current compounds induce PTC suppression or mediate NMD inhibition alone, although a few have the capacity to mediate both responses to some extent. The goal of this study is to develop a reporter system that will allow us to systematically identify new compounds with the ability to simultaneously induce PTC suppression and reduce NMD, which would provide the optimal therapeutic potential for CF patients.",

The response of these reporters to PTC suppression and NMD inhibition was tested by the treatment of cells with a variety of PTC suppressors and NMD inhibitors both individually and together. Our results show that NMD inhibition alone increased the NanoLuc luciferase activity and the mRNA abundance expressed from the dual RT/NMD reporter by 1.5-4 fold. Treatment with a variety of readthrough drugs increased NanoLuc activity 2-50 fold. Importantly, the combination of NMD inhibitors and readthrough drugs increased NanoLuc activity by as much as 700-fold (depending on the PTC context and the cell line). The synergistic effect of combining NMD inhibition with readthrough observed with the dual RT/NMD reporter was not seen in the NMD-only and RT-only controls. These results demonstrate that this new NanoLuc luciferase-based RT/NMD reporter system can be used to simultaneously monitor both NMD inhibition and PTC suppression. We anticipate that the use of this system will allow the identification of new, more effective compounds for the treatment of CF in patients that harbor PTCs. Introduction: Lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy is expected to debut in the Netherlands in 2016 as standard care for patients above 12 years of age who are homozygous for the p.Phe508del mutation. It is known that drug responses to this therapy may vary significantly and it is not clear yet which patients will benefit most. Recent developments enable us to assess the effects of CFTR-modifying drugs in vitro with a functional CFTR assay using patient-derived intestinal organoids (Dekkers JF, et al. Nat Med. 2013; 19:939-45) . This assay may facilitate future personalized medicine approaches, by predicting clinical responses based on the effects on the function of CFTR p.Phe508del mutant proteins in organoids. The objective of this project is to evaluate the clinical response to treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with homozygous p.Phe508del mutations and to assess the in vitro-in vivo correspondence of this response.

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation, in part attributable to the potent chemotactic agent interleukin-8 (IL-8). High levels of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and IL-8 have been found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with CF. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an acute phase protein that possesses both immune regulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. This glycosylated protein is posttranslationally modified via the addition of Nglycosidically linked oligosaccharides such as sialic acid, giving rise to different glycoforms. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of AAT versus AAT with increased sialylation (sAAT) to inhibit IL-8 signaling. The biological consequence of the AAT-induced inhibition was investigated at the level of neutrophil chemotaxis.",

            "text": "Conclusions: This report of our single-center experience describes tolerance of lumacaftor-ivacaftor in both adult and pediatric patients outside of a randomized controlled trial. We report similar rates of adverse and serious adverse events to the TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT studies; however, we report a much higher discontinuation rate. This difference may relate to medication use by patients in our center whose characteristics deviate from those studies' inclusion/exclusion criteria. It is also possible that both a participant bias among study subjects towards continuation, as well as the process of clinical decision-making outside of a research study environment, may contribute to these observed differences in discontinuation rates. The volume and composition of the airway surface liquid (ASL), a thin layer of fluid covering the luminal (apical) surface of the airway epithelium, are important in maintaining ciliary function, mucociliary clearance, and antimicrobial properties of the airway. In CF, these homeostatic mechanisms are impaired, leading to a dehydrated and acidic ASL. ASL volume depletion in CF is secondary to defective anion transport by CFTR. Abnormal CFTR-mediated bicarbonate transport creates an unfavorable, acidic environment, which impairs antimicrobial function and alters mucus properties and clearance. These disease mechanisms create a disordered airway milieu, consisting of thick mucopurulent secretions and chronic bacterial infection. We previously reported that aerosol brevenal, a natural product produced by the dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, augments wholelung mucociliary clearance and its surrogate marker, tracheal mucus velocity (TMV), when nebulized to sheep with diminished CFTR activity due to aerosol challenge with CFTRinh-172 or CFTRinh-172 with human neutrophil elastase. Brevenal is a potent voltage-sensitive sodium channel (VSSC) inhibitor (10 -8 ), not yet known to be expressed in epithelial cells. Brevenal does not affect ENaC or CFTR, suggesting it may alter the function of other ion transporters to affect ASL depth and augment mucus clearance. Here, we used one-micron resolution optical coherence tomography (\u03bcOCT) to examine the effect of brevenal on ASL depth in CF primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells homozygous for F508del. At 24 hours, brevenal-treated (1 \u03bcM, basolateral) cells exhibited significantly higher ASL depth (11.02 \u00b1 1.3, P<0.001) vs vehicle control (7.66 \u00b1 0.6), and compared favorably to treatment with positive control (9.30 \u00b1 0.3) corrector-potentiator therapy (lumacaftor (VX-809, 3 \u03bcM) and ivacaftor (VX-770, 10 \u03bcM)). Augmented ASL depth was not observed at 6 hours, reflecting the kinetics of this pathway. Compared to baseline, the change in ASL depth at 24 hours with brevenal treatment was 4.00 \u00b1 1.2 (P<0.05) vs 1.62 \u00b1 0.7 (P=NS) with vehicle control and 3.54 \u00b1 0.4 (P<0.001) with lumacaftor-ivacaftor. Brevenal had no effect on ciliary beat frequency (-0.17 \u00b1 0.3 Hz) after 24 hours. Analysis of changes in mucociliary transport are in progress. Overall, these results indicate that brevenal augments ASL depth without altering ciliary beating in F508del primary HBE monolayers, and is active even when added to the basolateral compartment. This partially explains how brevenal augmented mucociliary transport in sheep, and suggests the need for further mechanistic studies to determine its molecular target. If confirmed, VSSC inhibitors may be a therapeutic target to augment ASL depth in CF. Brevenal may be beneficial as an adjuvant therapy to improve ASL depth and mucociliary clearance in CF patients. Poor airway clearance associated with abnormally viscoelastic airway mucus is an important target for CF therapy. Airway mucins are unusually cysteine (Cys)-rich and show increased intra-and inter-molecular disulfide bonding under oxidizing conditions. However, systemic or inhaled mucolytic agents such as N-acetyl Cys are general reductants that exhibit poor clinical efficacy, as well as off-target toxicity and low tolerability. Replacement with more potent and disulfide-specific enzymatic reductants has the potential to create pharmacologically superior drugs. Human thioredoxin-1 (Txn) is a highly selective disulfide bond-reducing enzyme normally secreted into the airway with strong activity on CF sputum viscoelasticity at micromolar concentrations. To optimize Txn as an inhaled agent, we engineered a nonsystemic thiol-trapping variant (ORP-100S, Theradux\u2122) to enable stable, covalent linkage to mucin disulfide bonds. Theradux and native Txn both have unusually low Cys thiol pKa (6.3), thus increasing disulfide-reducing activity several 1000-fold vs classical thiol agents (pKa 8.7 -9.5), which are largely inactive in vivo in the neutral-to-acidic CF airway. Previously, we demonstrated that Theradux 1) does not induce inflammation in rats on aerosol inhalation in vivo or in human cells in vitro, and 2) normalizes the viscoelasticity of expectorated human CF sputum to a greater degree than native Txn or other thiol agents. We therefore hypothesized that Theradux will improve mucus transportability. To evaluate this, we used primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) monolayers to examine mucus transportability in situ following 3-h treatment with Theradux (1 mM) vs DTT (1.6 mM) and PBS control via one-micron resolution optical coherence tomography (\u03bcOCT). Theradux-treated cells exhibited increased mucociliary transport (2.18 \u00b1 0.3 mm/min, P<0.01) vs PBS (0.05 \u00b1 0.007 mm/min) that exceeded the effect of DTT (1.41 \u00b1 0.1 mm/min). Ciliary beating also was increased with Theradux treatment (13.87 \u00b1 0.4 Hz, P=0.06), as observed with DTT (16.17 \u00b1 0.8 Hz) but not vehicle control (10.62 \u00b1 1.1 Hz). Both viscous and elastic moduli of CF HBE mucus were reduced following treatment ex vivo with 1 mM Theradux, and analysis of changes in viscosity in situ are in progress. These results indicate that reducing disulfide bonds by Theradux increases mucus transportability, and suggest that Theradux may be a potential CF treatment by acting as an efficacious modifier of excess mucin viscoelasticity while optimized for activity across a broad airway pH microenvironment. Nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) operates with variable efficiency and does not completely degrade all transcripts containing nonsense mutations. We have tested the hypothesis that nonsense mutations vary in their effect on mRNA stability and protein synthesis and that this information can be used to inform treatment.",

Hit profiling in three assays, representing Y122X, G542X, and W1282X mutations of CFTR, will help identify hits with pan-PTC efficacies. Given that essential cellular processes involved in translation are potentially impacted in the readthrough of PTC mutations, we also test the hits for cytotoxicity. Our initial results demonstrate a high hit confirmation rate with complex hit profiles due to the apparent differential allelic preference. Full-length readthrough products of CFTR have been detected when FRT cells expressing CFTR Y122X were incubated with a hit compound. Ongoing hit analysis, by means of analyzing readthrough protein products and mRNA levels, targets clustering confirmed hits and will cast light on mechanism-of-action and therapeutic potential of the hits. This study was intended to characterize features of molecular pathogenesis related to W1282X CFTR protein folding and channel gating. Based on expression protocols using isogenic Flp-In \u2122 -derived Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells, W1282X (truncated) protein levels were markedly diminished compared to wild-type, and partially rescued by chronic treatment with VX-770 and VX-809. Prolonged incubation with G418 accentuated increases in both W1282X mRNA and protein, in a fashion unrelated to translational readthrough. In addition, W1282X protein could be increased with proteasome inhibitors ALLN or MG132, demonstrating importance of proteasomal degradation of the truncated mutant. In order to determine amounts of W1282X CFTR at the cell surface under various conditions, a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tag was inserted on an externally directed segment of W1282X CFTR. Cell-based chemiluminescence and FACS were then performed to monitor surface expression of CFTR-HRP following exposure to correctors and/or potentiators. Chronic treatment with VX-809 marginally increased the HRP signal. However, combined treatment with VX-809 and VX-770 resulted in marked enhancement of HRP by 30-or 27-fold in the presence or absence of G418, respectively. Flow cytometry supported these findings, indicating that CFTR W1282X-HRP traffics minimally to the cell surface, but can be augmented when CFTR modulators are given in combination. We and others have reported previously that W1282X CFTR maintains low level residual function as an ion channel. Ussing chamber studies demonstrate that treatment with either VX-770 or VX-809 acutely induces activation. We also show that W1282X CFTR exhibits a significant channel gating defect, and activity in the membrane patch can be substantially increased by VX-770 or curcumin. Taken together, our results suggest that CFTR truncated at position 1282 leads to protein that is poorly functional. We speculate that absence of the carboxy terminal PDZ domain and/or portions of NBD2 that participate in domain swapping may confer defects in overall stability. Small molecules developed to address the W1282X mutation may therefore be required to: 1) improve mRNA stability, 2) enhance protein maturation, and 3) overcome abnormal channel gating. This is in addition to promoting readthrough of the nonsense codon. In summary, our evaluation provides a framework for drug discovery relevant to W1282X and other prematurely truncated In-frame premature termination codons (PTCs) account for 11% of all disease-associated mutations. PTC suppression therapy utilizes small molecules that suppress translation termination at PTCs to partially restore synthesis of full-length proteins. PTC suppression is mediated by base pairing of a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA with a PTC. However, little is known about the identity of the amino acids inserted during PTC suppression in mammalian cells, or how the sequence context surrounding PTCs influences amino acid incorporation.",

Tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) revealed that leucine (58%), cysteine (38%) and tryptophan (4%) are inserted in the CFTR-W1282X context following UGA suppression. Interestingly, these amino acids and their proportions are significantly different from those identified following suppression of the CFTR-G542X UGA mutation, which are cysteine (44%), tryptophan (36%) and arginine (20%). These results demonstrate for the first time that the local sequence context plays a key role in determining the amino acids inserted during PTC suppression (and their relative proportions). We found that some of the variants generated by suppression exhibit reduced CFTR maturation and activity compared to wild-type CFTR. Both a CFTR corrector (VX-809) and potentiator (VX-770) enhanced activity of many of the variants induced by G418-mediated suppression. These results suggest that PTC suppression in combination with CFTR modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of CF patients with PTCs. We are in the process of validating reporters to determine the amino acids that are inserted during suppression of the CFTR-R553X and CFTR-R1162X PTCs and their effect on CFTR function. In addition, we are also constructing reporters to examine suppression at other PTCs that have been identified in CF patients. These studies provide important mechanistic details of PTC suppression to aid the selection of more effective drugs that are tailored to specific CFTR nonsense mutations. Rationale: Almost half of all CF patients experience some form of intestinal obstruction during their lifetime including meconium ileus, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome or the less severe but underdiagnosed constipation. Current treatments vary in the degree of effectiveness from patient to patient and new therapies are necessary. Linzess, a novel drug used the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with chronic constipation, has not been widely prescribed in CF patients to treat intestinal issues since activation of CFTR is thought to be the main mechanism of action.

Intestines from CF mice carrying either the F508del or null Cftr alleles displayed improved intestinal transit and increased fluid retention. Initial studies suggest that Linzess may block intestinal sodium absorption in the CF intestine improving the CF intestinal environment and possibly decreasing intestinal obstructions. Background: Progression of CF lung disease is induced by episodic infectious events called acute pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). These episodes indicate either acquisition of new bacterial infection or a change in the density of previously colonizing bacteria. PEx are poorly defined and difficult to diagnose in the setting of chronic inflammation. Currently, there is no biochemical test to diagnose CF pulmonary exacerbations and no consensus diagnostic criteria for what constitutes an exacerbation. Neutrophil CD64 expression is highly specific to acute infection, even on a background of chronic inflammation, and is diagnostic of acute bacterial infection in subjects with sepsis and rheumatoid arthritis. We hypothesized that a quantitative flow cytometry assay to measure CD64 expression directly off circulating CF neutrophils could sensitively predict acute exacerbations and reflect neutrophil phagocytic activity at the time of acute exacerbation.",

            "text": "Study supported by the Colorado Bioscience Discovery Evaluation Program. Abnormal airway smooth muscle (ASM) function is thought to contribute to airway hyperreactivity. In cystic fibrosis (CF), airway hyperresponsiveness has been frequently reported and suggests that an altered ASM physiology may contribute to CF airway disease. We have previously shown that the newborn CFTR-/-pig displays ASM abnormalities prior to the onset of inflammation or infection including increased basal tone, increased bronchodilator response, and decreased calcium reuptake. The goals of this study were to: 1) identify whole genome transcriptional and proteomic changes in porcine CF ASM prior to airway inflammation and infection, 2) investigate whether specific pathways are associated with CF airway reactivity, and 3) determine if the CF pig ASM transcriptome can be used to identify potential ASM therapeutics for CF and other airway narrowing diseases. Total RNA sequencing of newborn non-CF and CF ASM revealed differential and significant changes in muscle contraction related genes, ontologies, and pathways. High-throughput ELISA protein comparisons between non-CF and CF ASM cells revealed complementary pathway dysregulation. The genomic and proteomic signatures were used to perform pathway analysis. Large-scale changes in transcript, protein abundance, and phosphorylation status were significantly different in PI3K/AKT and MAPK controlled pathways in CF samples. PYK2, a calcium-sensitive tyrosine kinase known to be an upstream regulator of both PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, showed increased phosphorylation status suggesting increased activity. We then used a small molecule inhibitor of PYK2 to test whether blocking PYK2 activation could alter airway contractility. Wild-type precision cut lung slices pretreated with the kinase inhibitor demonstrated decreased airway narrowing in response to cholinergic stimulation compared to DMSO controls. Additionally, pretreatment with the compound in isolated wild-type smooth muscle strips diminished force production and decreased myosin light chain phosphorylation. These studies show that loss of CFTR in ASM causes genome-wide transcriptional and proteomic changes, including expected alterations in muscle contraction transcripts and proteins. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic changes revealed significant dysregulation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways suggesting a basis for changes in contractile machinery, cytoskeletal arrangement, and transcription factor activity. Additionally, we were able to identify a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can modulate ASM function. By recognizing the newborn CF pig as a model of ASM hyperreactivity absent inflammation, we can enhance our molecular understanding of ASM biology and pathophysiology in addition to discovering novel therapeutics for airflow limitation. Supported by American Asthma Foundation. Background: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan (T) to kynurenine (K). Elevated levels of IDO have been detected in association with respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). The increased level of IDO activity during infection is believed to be due to the host cells and the pathogen(s). The increased levels of IDO modulates the immune response against microbial pathogens in chronic infections, including respiratory diseases such as CF. Since active infection in CF patients is associated with exacerbation (EXBN) we hypothesized that elevated levels of IDO would be detected in the plasma of CF patients during an EXBN. The primary objective of this study was to examine the level of IDO activity by determining the relative amounts of K and T in plasma of CF patients with and without EXBN.",

During the period we defined as being dominated by small airway retention, both clearance rate and clearable fraction were dramatically enhanced by acute HS treatment. Finally, inhalation with the SILP method in the supine position did not target more of the radioaerosol to the apical lung regions to allow better measure of MCC from this region. Overall these data suggest that the SILP method is superior to the existing TB method for testing of therapeutics aimed at enhancing MCC from the small airways in CF.",

The etiology may be related to inhaled/oral antibiotic usage, oral cleaning practices after inhaled medications, and their regular dental care. There may be selection bias as our cohort were seen by a dentist regularly, however this frequency is similar to that otherwise reported. Despite this, half of these patients may present with dental defects, especially on teeth developing during the first year of life. These defects may be related to CF disease, treatments, or surgeries. Defects can lead to aesthetic issues, tooth sensitivity, and loss of tooth structure, which can beget pain, need for restorative treatments (ie, crowns), or tooth loss. Next steps include further analysis into these trends and their association with CF disease and treatments. In early studies in mice, resistin was identified as an adipokine promoting insulin resistance and inflammation. However, in humans resistin is made primarily by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Consistent with its dual role as a metabolic and inflammatory mediator, human resistin is found in abnormal levels in metabolic disorders and in disorders linked to PMN-driven inflammation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) combines PMN-dominated airway inflammation with profound metabolic anomalies. Consistently, resistin is elevated in the plasma and airway fluid of CF patients compared to healthy controls (HC). Clinically, sputum resistin levels correlate negatively with CF lung function. Here, we further probed the resistin signaling cascade in CF airways.",

The therapeutic effect of direct potentiation of CFTR (ie, functional Class III and IV CFTR mutations) has previously been demonstrated with ivacaftor. These findings support the notion that a CFTR potentiator can yield clinical benefit in CF patients who have selected genotypes. Defining inclusion and exclusion criteria based on the CFTR genotypes' functional class for a clinical trial with a CFTR potentiator relies, in part, on predictability of preclinical electrophysiology experiments. Here we test the activity of QBW251, a novel CFTR potentiator on functional Class III and Class IV CFTR mutations expressed in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells and assess the correlation in potency to clinical efficacy in patients carrying the same CFTR mutations.",

The Isc in vitro data translated to clinical efficacy in CF patients carrying the same CFTR mutations. These findings support further assessment of QBW251 in other class III and IV mutations to elucidate its therapeutic potential. We have shown that CF subjects have a somewhat lower lung water density at FRC and a significantly higher lung water density at TLC when compared with normal controls. We interpret these findings to reflect the presence of excess fluid from biofilm accumulation and other pathologies leading to increased density at TLC and also of air trapping in the lung periphery resulting in decreased density at FRC. Our preliminary data show that the ratio of the median lung water density at FRC to that at TLC, the mFLD ratio, was significantly smaller in CF patients than in controls. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that lung abnormalities in CF can be spatially identified by changes in the mFLD ratio when compared to a regional probabilistic library of the mFLD ratio in controls, and that the technique is able to capture the efficacy of therapy.",

The median FLD (mFLD) was calculated for 18 regions in the left and right lung (36 total regions) at both lung volumes. The 36 regions were designated as follows: 1) each lung was equally divided into a medial and a lateral section; 2) each section was then divided into 9 regions by superimposing a 3\u00d73 grid onto the lung section. For both CF subjects, regional t-scores of the mFLD ratio were then calculated and compared against control data using the Crawford-Howell t-score methodology (J Clin Exp Neuropsychol.1998; 20:905) . A t-score of -1.0 indicates the mFLD ratio was one standard deviation (1SD) below the control average (abnormal mFLD ratio). Regional change in t-scores between time points was also calculated. A \u0394t-score of 1.0 indicates the mFLD ratio for the specified region increased (eg, improved) by 1SD of the control population.",

Recent clinical trials using cystic fibrosis (CF, F508del/F508del) patients studied the combination of a CFTR corrector (VX-809) and potentiator (VX-770) for improving CFTR folding, trafficking, and channel gating, leading to the approval of Orkambi\u2122. Although overall effects on lung function (eg, FEV 1 ) were statistically significant; they were modest, suggesting the need for additional therapeutic approaches with an alternative mechanism of action. Therefore, we measured the enhanced in vitro effects of a S-nitrosoglutathione reductase inhibitor (GSNORi, N91115) on modulating CFTR when added to a CFTR corrector (VX-809 or VX-661) + CFTR potentiator (VX-770) by; 1) measuring CFTR activity in primary human CF (F508del/F508del) airway epithelial (HAE) cells by Ussing chamber analysis and; 2) quantifying plasma membrane (PM) CFTR protein expression and turnover in a CFBE41o-cell line. First, although addition of N91115 to chronic CFTR corrector + potentiator resulted in a comparable level of initial forskolin-mediated CFTR activation in Ussing chambers, the addition of N91115 appeared to \"stabilize\" the level of CFTR activity up to the time of inhibition by CFTR inh 172. A positive change in slope was also observed reflecting sustained N91115-mediated CFTR activity. Area under the curve (AUC), measured as total net chloride secretion from CFTR activation to inhibition, also demonstrated a significant improvement with the addition of N91115 versus corrector + potentiator alone. Moreover, when N91115 was added to chronic CFTR corrector + acute CFTR potentiator, a further increase in potentiator-mediated short circuit current (I sc ) as well as an increase in total potentiated CFTR (CFTR-stimulated AUC) was observed. The I sc that was inhibited by CFTR inh 172 was also significantly greater in CF HAE cells treated with N91115 + corrector versus corrector alone, further suggesting an additive increase of CFTR activity with N91115. Second, expression of CFTR at the plasma membrane (PM) was measured by On-Cell Western analysis in CFBE41o-cells expressing an F508del-3HA tag on an extracellular loop of CFTR. We observed a significant increase in PM CFTR expression when N91115 was added alone as well as in addition to a CFTR corrector. When cells were treated with chronic CFTR corrector + potentiator, a significant decrease in PM CFTR was observed. However, this decrease in PM CFTR expression was significantly reversed back to corrector treated levels alone with the addition of N91115. Furthermore, PM CFTR turnover (CFTR remaining at the PM up to 3 hours) was significantly improved when N91115 was added to a CFTR corrector, or CFTR corrector + potentiator, demonstrating increased PM CFTR stability. Currently, additional in vitro studies are ongoing to explore the effects of GSNORi on wild-type CFTR expression, function, and stability. Overall, this preclinical data provides evidence for the utilization of an additive therapy approach using N91115 to stabilize corrected and potentiated CFTR at the plasma membrane of CF patients. The mechanisms responsible for ivacaftor-mediated lung function improvement remain incompletely understood. We are studying the relationships between infection, inflammation, and lung function in 12 Irish CF subjects with G551D mutations treated with ivacaftor.

Toxicological testing with SPX-101 delivered by nebulization into rats and dogs for 7-and 28-days showed no adverse toxicological findings at lung-deposited doses of up to 24 and 8 mg/kg/day, respectively. Low systemic exposure of SPX-101 was found and no hyperkalemia occurred. No significant inhibition of hERG was observed at doses up to 1 mM and no genotoxic effects were found. SPX-101 was also free from any changes in respiration or cardiovascular parameters from either intravenous or inhaled administration. No anti-SPX-101 antibodies were detected following 60 days of treatment by intraperitoneal or intranasal administration.",

Worryingly, we found that these clones are associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased levels of virulence. Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent bacterial species isolated from the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients during childhood, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa is predominantly isolated from adults with CF. We recently characterized P. aeruginosa biofilm growth on primary CF airway epithelial cells (AECs) and observed enhanced biofilm formation during co-infection with respiratory viruses (Hendricks MR, et al. PNAS. 2016; 113:1642-7) . We hypothesize that infection with respiratory viruses alters microbial community dynamics in the CF airways, affecting the balance between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa populations. The goals of this work are: 1) to compare S. aureus biofilm growth on CF and non-CF AECs, and 2) to study the dynamics of S. aureus infection alone and during co-infection with P. aeruginosa and respiratory viruses. Initial studies showed a 3-log increase in S. aureus on immortalized CF bronchial AECs over 24 hours, and confocal microscopy revealed biofilm-like clusters of bacteria on AECs. Measuring expression of biofilm and planktonic marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR confirmed S. aureus exists in a biofilm state on CF AECs. To learn if S. aureus biofilm growth differs at distinct sites in the respiratory tract, biofilm assays were performed on well-differentiated primary CF and non-CF bronchial, nasal, and sinonasal AECs. Infection of all non-CF cell types resulted in a decrease in viable S. aureus over time. However, while CF nasal and sinonasal AECs showed killing activity towards S. aureus, CF bronchial AECs supported S. aureus growth. A similar trend in anti-S. aureus activity was observed in growth assays utilizing airway surface liquid collected from primary AECs. Current studies are evaluating the airway surface liquid pH of CF and non-CF bronchial cells to determine if pH dysregulation is a factor impacting the ability of CF bronchial AECs to kill S. aureus. In initial co-infection experiments with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa on CF bronchial AECs, S. aureus biofilms grew during co-infection with P. aeruginosa. However, when co-infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), P. aeruginosa growth increased dramatically, while S. aureus growth decreased. Live-cell imaging experiments evaluating biofilm formation on CF bronchial AECs under flow conditions showed both species of bacteria in close association within biofilms on AECs, and in the presence of RSV co-infection, P. aeruginosa dominated growth. Ongoing experiments are investigating how specific host antimicrobial mechanisms utilized during viral-bacterial co-infections might skew the microbial communities in the CF airway. Background: CF results in chronic lung infections with frequent exacerbations of symptoms. Changes in microbial community dynamics are believed to be responsible for CF exacerbations. Preliminary evidence indicates that anaerobes and their fermentative metabolism are associated with exacerbation development in CF. We hypothesized that mucus pH drives these dynamics and tested this using a culture microcosm of the lung.",

Antibiotic pressure disrupted this pH-based structure by killing anaerobes but not P. aeruginosa. Metabolites produced by P. aeruginosa were also altered by media pH. Mathematical models supported this pH-driven community dynamic, but also revealed that the radius of a bronchus has a significant impact. Wider lung bronchi create room for anaerobic fermentation leading to a higher rate of community flux. Incorporating periodic antibiotic treatment for exacerbations into the model resulted in a cyclic dynamic, where anaerobes are killed and P. aeruginosa thrives, then anaerobes reestablish after antibiotic pressure subsides.",

Background: The immune response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung is characterised by neutrophildominated inflammation, which is incompletely effective at clearing infection and causes lung tissue damage, ultimately resulting in respiratory failure. To combat bacterial infection, neutrophils produce the potent oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or bleach, which is generated by myeloperoxidase, an enzyme that accounts for ~5% of neutrophil protein. The importance of HOCl in bacterial killing in the CF lung and the ways in which P. aeruginosa defends itself against HOCl are poorly understood.",

These strains had mutations in genes encoding regulators with roles in controlling antibiotic resistance, catabolite repression, motility, methionine biosynthesis and quorum sensing. Interestingly, mutants of genes homologous to E. coli HOCl-sensing regulators (RclR, HypT and NemR) did not display altered susceptibility to HOCl. A mutant in mexT, which encodes a positive regulator of the multidrug efflux pump operon, mexEF-oprN, was sensitive to HOCl, no growth was observed after 24 hours. A mutant in ampR, which encodes a global regulator found to negatively regulate mexEF-oprN displayed HOCl resistance, as it exited lag phase 6 hours earlier than wild type (WT). Additional screening of strains with mutations in mexE and mexF for growth in the presence of HOCl identified an 8-9 and 5-8 hour delay, respectively, in exiting lag phase compared to WT, indicating HOCl sensitivity. P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from chronic CF lung infection have been identified with mutations in ampR or mexT, suggesting a potential role for these regulators in adaptation (Diaz Caballero J, et al. mBio, 2015; 6:e00981-15 ). Furthermore, mutants of cbrA and cbrB, which encode a two-component system that regulates carbon and nitrogen utilisation were resistant to HOCl, indicated by a rapid onset of growth compared to WT. CbrAB negatively regulates the global regulator crc via the small RNA crcZ, and a mutant in crc was sensitive to HOCl, no growth was observed after 24 hours. In addition to further investigations into HOCl protective mechanisms, the mutants identified are being used in assays to test the hypothesis that HOCl is crucial for neutrophil-mediated killing of bacteria in the context of CF infection.",

McMaster Univ., Hamilton, ON, Canada Introduction: AZLI is an inhaled antibiotic (Abx), cycled in a 28-day \"on/off\" fashion, used to treat chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in CF. Whereas aztreonam is considered to have a spectrum of activity limited to aerobic gram-negative organisms based on levels achieved parenterally, AZLI achieves extremely high concentrations potentially extending its spectrum of activity. We hypothesized that AZLI is active against organisms within the CF lung microbiome thereby exerting a portion of its clinical benefit.

Whether dynamics in this diverse population of infecting PA exist -potentially influencing the occurrence of an exacerbation and/or treatment response is heretofore unknown. The major barrier in understanding flux in PA population dynamics relates to finding a convenient method by which to collect regular samples. Serial home collection and storage of frozen sputum followed en masse by thawing and recovery of isolates offers the potential to overcome this limitation.

Introduction: CF affects many systems in the body, but the characteristic symptom that dramatically reduces quality of life is associated with the accumulation of mucus in the lungs. In the long term, this static mucoid environment gets colonized by a diverse community of microbes, viruses and fungi, therefore, becoming a reservoir for infection and requiring chronic treatment with antibiotics. Generally, the choice of antibiotic is not targeted and in many cases is administered after the infection has advanced. In addition to long-term side effects of these drugs, eventually antibiotic resistant bacteria and fungi can take hold and complicate further treatment. Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGEN), in collaboration with the University of Arizona, has initiated a study to track changes in the microbial and fungal community over time in patients with CF. The purpose of this study is to better understand the CF pulmonary microbiome over time and determine if emerging pathogens and antibiotic resistance can be detected prior to exacerbation. A primary goal of the study is to develop and evaluate personalized, targeted microbiome assays for rapid characterization of a patient's current pulmonary community. These prototype diagnostics could potentially be used to advise treatment that is personalized and timely.",

            "text": "Discussion: Newer techniques for analysis of the CF microbiome have the potential of not only describing the microbiological environment in the CF lung but also distinguish susceptibilities and personalize treatments and therapies in a timely fashion. Current diagnostics of CF exacerbations are based on clinical culturing of microbial isolates from sputum samples followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing. Despite this established gold standard, studies have shown that antimicrobial susceptibility profiles frequently do not correlate with clinical outcomes. In some instances, antibiotic treatment still results in patient recovery despite highly reported resistance. This underlies the incomplete understanding of the microbial basis of CF exacerbations and the best methods for treatment. The likely cause of this discrepancy is that many pathogens in CF lungs are not identified in standard clinical labs. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiling has shown that CF lung infections are much more diverse than that revealed by clinical culture. Thus, we have begun to implement a \"Rapid Response\" pipeline for CF exacerbations that employs multi-omics data including transcriptome, metabolome and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to provide a timely, comprehensive assessment to clinicians. Sputum samples are collected and then DNA, RNA and metabolites extracted, followed by nucleic acid sequencing and mass spectrometry, and finally, data analysis. The pipeline generates microbial taxonomy, gene expression and metabolite production information requiring high-powered computational resources to analyze. Despite the enormous scale of the data generated, a highly streamlined and integrative bioinformatics pipeline allows for analysis in less than 48 hours using a small group of people. Information is provided on virulence factor production, host inflammatory signals, gene expression of both microbes and host, taxonomic profiles of bacterial lung infections, including any new pathogens that may be driving an exacerbation event, and penetration of drugs to the site of infection. Recent application of this pipeline to a severe exacerbation event showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth was slow despite 95% of the lung microbiome being composed of this bacterium, expressing mostly alginate and iron chelating genes, while the 16S rDNA sequencing revealed a possible bloom of anaerobes. Metabolite production matched transcriptome profiling in that both detected the production of the siderophore pyochelin and also revealed that antibiotics given to the patient were reaching the site of infection. In this instance, the omics pipelines had mosly harmonious conclusions about this exacerbation. The future of CF exacerbation diagnostics and other diseases involving complex infections will employ multi-omics data, because efforts such as this one, show that timeframes for producing, analyzing, and translating this rich data to physicians now approaches the gold standard of bacterial culture. 305w Introduction: During coughing, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) can generate P. aeruginosa droplet nuclei capable of travelling up to 4 metres and remaining viable for up 45 minutes (Knibbs L, et al. Thorax. 2014; 69:740-5) . The CF Foundation (CFF) recently updated their infection control guidelines to include the recommendation that patients with CF wear surgical face masks in communal areas of health facilities to reduce transmission of pathogens (Saiman L, et al. ICHE. 2014 ;35:S1-67). However, the outward protection of face masks worn by CF patients has not been extensively studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of face masks and cough etiquette techniques for reducing viable bioaerosols in patients with CF and chronic P. aeruginosa infection during talking and coughing.",

Furthermore, patients treated with clarithromycin appeared to have more positive clinical responses, though interpretation is limited by small numbers and the heterogeneity of treatment regimens. Further investigation is needed to determine the impact of resistance patterns and continuation phase on the findings, as well as multivariate approaches to try and control for heterogeneity. However, these findings remain important in light of current guidelines that favor azithromycin over clarithromycin. Background: The prevalence of MRSA infections is increasing in CF patients and is associated with a consistent decline in FEV1 and higher mortality. Although there are cases of spontaneous clearance of MRSA, early eradication treatment (EET) could increase the percentage of clearance of the germ providing a clinically relevant germ-free period and therefore avoiding a negative prognostic factor. The microbiological outcome could indicate that prevention of persistent infection by EET of MRSA is a simple way for improving the long-term prognosis in CF patients.",

We are currently investigating how these groups differ in terms of clinical characteristics and outcomes. (CF) is genetic multi-organ disease caused by absent or dysfunctional CFTR-mediated anion secretion, which in the lung, leads to mucus obstruction and chronic infection/inflammation. The Burkholderia cenocepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of 18 genetically distinct species. Although generally harmless to humans, they are extremely pathogenic to CF patients, and acquisition of Bcc is associated with a significant increase in mortality. Treatment of Bcc infections are difficult as the bacteria are multidrug resistant and able to survive in biofilms (Mahenthiralingam E, et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2002; 33:1469-75 ). Short Palate Lung and Nasal Epithelial Clone 1 (SPLUNC1) is secreted by the airway epithilia and is a multifunctional innate defense protein. SPLUNC1 is known to have antimicrobial functions against many gram-negative bacteria including Bcc. CF airway surface liquid (ASL) is characterized with an increase of acidity which renders SPLUNC1 inactive and unable to regulate the epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) (Garland AL, et al. PNAS. 2013; 110:15973-8) . We therefore tested the hypotheses that SPLUNC1's antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against Bcc were also pH-sensitive.",

Introduction: Achromobacter spp. are emerging CF pathogens with reported prevalence of 5-21%. Traditionally, Achromobacter spp. infections in CF have been attributed exclusively to A. xylosoxidans (AX) as biochemical testing and 16S rDNA PCR do not readily differentiate species. However, recent data have demonstrated a much greater breadth of species infecting the CF lower airways. Taking advantage of a longitudinal strain collection established in 1978 encompassing every isolate recovered from each CF patient, we sought to determine: 1) the species level identity of each Achromobacter isolate, 2) the natural history of infection and presence of common strains within our cohort to evaluate the potential of patient-patient spread, and 3) if particular phenotypic traits differed between species, and correlated with the ability to cause chronic infection or were more common in CF isolates.",

Introduction: Rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) is a new technique that has been shown to accurately classify yeast and bacteria. Thermal stress is applied onto bacterial colonies which results in evaporation and ionisation of metabolites and structural lipids. The mass spectrometer detects and identifies analytes through spectral database comparison (Strittmatter N, et al. Anal Chem. 2014; 86:6555-62) . We describe the application of REIMS to cystic fibrosis (CF)-related pathogens and show that the technology can identify P. aeruginosa with 100% accuracy. Differences were observed in the phospholipid and rhamnolipid range; derivatives of quorum sensing molecules (QSM) were also detected. These may provide useful biomarkers for a non-invasive diagnostic tool using ambient mass spectrometric (MS) approaches currently in development.",

Deficient Cftr function results in altered epithelial cell ion transport contributing to defective mucociliary clearance and subsequent colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. New and innovative therapeutics have been geared towards improving not only Cftr expression and activity, but also to manage inflammation and chronic infection. Using in vivo murine models, bone marrow transplantation of Cftr-deficient animals with wild-type bone marrow has been shown to provide benefit in decreasing inflammation and aiding in infection resolution. The use of bone marrow transplantation however, is counter-intuitive for CF, since the immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent transplant rejection has the potential of exacerbating the chronic pulmonary infection in CF patients. We have begun to pursue the concept of autologous bone marrow corrective therapeutics and mesenchymal stem cells as an alternative cell therapy to traditional transplantation in CF as a potential means to improved management of infection and inflammation. We created the myeloid-specific knockout, in which only the myeloid cells are deficient in CFTR as well as the myeloid-specific knockin where CFTR is deficient everywhere but the myeloid compartment. Further, bone marrow-derived macrophages from both CFTR deficient and wild-type animals were infused in the murine model of CF infection and inflammation to investigate the therapeutic potential of treating CF with autologous cells in the absence of irradiation and immunosuppressive therapy. The impact of the bone marrow-derived cells on CF lung infection and inflammation was investigated using the CF murine model of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. We demonstrate that the myeloid-specific knockout has a phenotype which is not as severe as the total knockout, but is significantly more fragile in the ability to manage infection when compared to wild-type animals infected at the same time consistent with previous studies. Using our myeloid-specific knock-in, we demonstrate that although there is no statistical improvement in survival in the murine model of lung infection and inflammation, there are several immune parameters which are improved in terms of cytokine regulation and bacterial resolution. When Cftr-deficient animals were given wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (without irradiation), the infusion statistically improved both inflammation and infection resolution. These studies are consistent with the bone marrow transplantation and mesenchymal stem cell studies, suggesting that wild-type hematopoietic bone marrow cells (bone marrow, macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells), have the potential of supporting CF immunity, enhancing the management of infection and inflammation. As a next step in these studies we are beginning to explore genomic correction of myeloid cells, for potential therapeutic applications in CF.

Biofilms from persistent PA isolates grown in the presence of filtrates are also more resistant to antibiotic killing (at 1000mg/mL of tobramycin 60-80% kill in media only vs. 22-30% kill in 10% SA filtrate; p\u22640.001 between untreated control and treated persistent strain). The presence of SA filtrates did not affect the planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration to tobramycin of the PA isolates tested. The presence of filtrates from most SA isolates (n=4) did not affect initial formation of PA biofilms grown in a slide chamber for 24 hours, with no difference in thickness or architecture observed.",

Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa enters a biofilm mode of growth during chronic infection in the CF lung, conferring vastly increased resistance to clearance by the immune system and antimicrobials. Clinical studies have found a correlation between respiratory viral infection and pulmonary colonization with P. aeruginosa, though the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown. Using a unique model of the initial interaction of P. aeruginosa with respiratory epithelium, we have recently demonstrated that respiratory viral infection of the airway epithelium stimulates rapid biofilm biogenesis by P. aeruginosa, that apical iron-bound transferrin release is increased during respiratory viral infection, and that the increased iron levels are required for the induction of biofilm production (Hendricks MR, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2016; 113:1642-7) . Additional studies have isolated the primary source of the biofilm stimulatory effect to extracellular vesicles released by the airway epithelium during viral infection. Using a co-culture system of polarized CF bronchial epithelial cells and P. aeruginosa, we are investigating the mechanism by which P. aeruginosa is able to take advantage of the pulmonary environment following viral infection, focusing on iron uptake and homeostasis pathways. Preliminary data suggest that P. aeruginosa utilizes multiple iron uptake pathways, including siderophores, to scavenge increased iron in apical secretions from airway epithelial cells during viral co-infection. Iron is not sufficient, however, to induce P. aeruginosa biofilm biogenesis, as supplementation of media with transferrin at concentrations similar to those found in apical secretions of airway cells during viral infection did not induce biofilm biogenesis. These results suggest that either additional factors or nutrients are present on the extracellular vesicles released by the respiratory epithelium during viral infection or that the transferrin must be delivered on extracellular vesicles to stimulate biofilm biogenesis. RNA sequencing analysis of the P. aeruginosa transcriptome during viral co-infection revealed decreased expression of ferrous iron uptake pathways and increased expression of an uncharacterized putative iron uptake system, indicating an adaptive response to the increased levels of extracellular vesicle-associated transferrin during viral co-infection. Additionally, we observed shifts in P. aeruginosa amino acid catabolism pathways during viral co-infection, suggesting that metabolic changes also play a role in adaptation to the conditions created by the viral infection. These studies suggest that nutritional immunity is compromised in the lung during viral infection and that P. aeruginosa alters its iron homeostasis and metabolism to take advantage of the more permissive environment, providing a potential mechanism by which P. aeruginosa more readily colonizes the lungs of CF patients during respiratory viral infection.",

To test the hypothesis that iron homeostasis is also altered in the PN sinuses during viral infection, leading to increased bacterial colonization and biofilm growth, we performed a prospective study in a cohort of CF subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis. In this study, PN sinus secretions are being collected, as well as microbiome and viral swabs and associated clinical disease severity scores, approximately every three months starting January 2015. We have preliminarily analyzed iron levels in the PN sinus secretions in subjects at baseline and during viral infections. Viral infection was detected in 19% of our samples, with rhinovirus accounting for 90% of infections, and iron levels were significantly increased in PN sinus secretions during viral infection. Using primary PN sinus epithelial cells derived from CF patients, we observed an increase in P. aeruginosa biofilm growth in the presence of rhinovirus co-infection. Preliminary microbiome analysis found Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus to be the dominant genera and suggest shifts in the microbial communities of the PN sinuses occur during or following viral infections. Clinical disease severity and quality of life scores were not acutely altered during viral infection. Further study is required to better define shifts in the microbial community during respiratory viral infection of the upper respiratory tract and determine the long-term impacts on disease outcomes.",

Background: Limited therapeutic options, enhanced virulence properties, and phenotypic adaptations such as mucoid phenotypes contribute to an expanding threat to effective therapies for Burkholderia cepacia complex lung biofilm infection, frequently associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Thick mucus and biofilm formation in the CF lung can render therapeutics less effective. A series of non-toxic derivatized polyglucosamines shown to be broadly active at dermal and mucosal interfaces encompass a newly developed class of molecules designated poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG). Specifically, the PAAG15A derivative is a non-toxic, soluble, biopolymer shown to potentiate a wide range of antibiotics against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and to effectively dissolve biofilms, including those of B. cepacia complex. The three-dimensional checkerboard synergy and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assays were used to examine antibiotic synergy against planktonic bacteria and the removal of biofilms formed by several clinical isolates of B. cepacia complex associated with cystic fibrosis, respectively. These studies demonstrate the ability of PAAG15A to potentiate antibiotic activity and remove biofilms with the goal of supporting more effective treatments.",

Pulmonary aspergillosis is a common infection that can result in significant morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. Depending on the state of the host, infection can result in Aspergillus bronchitis or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), each of which are associated with diminished lung function and pulmonary exacerbations. Standard of care generally calls for oral doses of triazoles that inhibit fungal cytochrome P450s and inhibit fungal growth. Itraconazole (ITZ) and other triazoles are commonly used as first-line therapies for fungal infections. These treatments are generally poorly and variably bioavailable and result in a number of systemic side effects that limit their therapeutic potential. In addition, ITZ and other triazoles have an extensive list of drug-drug interactions that require drug monitoring during treatment and may lead to hepatotoxicity. We hypothesized that inhaled delivery of ITZ as a dry powder (PUR1900) would result in significantly higher lung exposure and lower systemic exposure relative to oral dosing.

This approach has the potential to improve disease outcome while reducing the side effect profile associated with oral dosing. Bacteria rarely exist in isolation, whether on human tissues or in the environment, and they frequently co-infect with other microbes. Co-infection by Staphylococcus aureus with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs commonly in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is associated with higher lung disease morbidity and mortality. While previous studies have demonstrated interactions between these two species that impact growth and metabolism, little is known regarding the impact of polymicrobial interactions on biofilm formation, a bacterial community lifestyle suggested to predominate within CF lungs and to result in persistent infections. S. aureus secretes numerous exoproducts that are known to interact with host tissues, influencing inflammatory responses. The abundantly secreted S. aureus protein A (SpA) binds a range of human glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, and other molecules, with diverse effects on the host, including inhibiting phagocytosis of S. aureus cells. However, the potential effects of SpA and other S. aureus exoproducts on co-infecting bacteria have not been explored. Here we show that S. aureus secreted products, including SpA, significantly alter two behaviors associated with persistent infection. We found that SpA inhibited biofilm formation by some P. aeruginosa CF sputum isolates, and it also inhibited phagocytosis by neutrophils of all P. aeruginosa isolates tested.",

Pharmacy, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA Purpose: In CF patients with moderate to severe lung disease and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, current guidelines recommend chronic inhaled antibiotics given in 28-day on/off cycles. Tobramycin and aztreonam are the only two agents currently approved for this use. Based on the annual CF Foundation Patient Registry reports from 2009-2012, clinical practice is trending towards use of a continuous rotation of two inhaled antibiotics, as opposed to a 28-day on/off cycle using only a single agent. Current guidelines do not address incorporating both medications into a patient's maintenance regimen, and there are no clinical trials that have been able to effectively evaluate the risks and benefits of such therapy. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to compare lung function (FEV1) and number of pulmonary exacerbations one year leading up to the initiation of dual rotating inhaled antibiotic therapy and one year after being on dual therapy. The secondary objective was to determine whether the CF care team evaluated and documented the outcomes of dual therapy and assessed the benefits and/or risks of continuing dual therapy.",

There was no statistically significant difference in frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. In a subgroup analysis of patients receiving inhaled aztreonam as monotherapy, there was a statistically significant decrease in best FEV1 by 10 percentage points when patients were transitioned to dual therapy (p<0.05).

Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) with the majority of adults being chronically colonised with this organism. Pseudomonas colonises by adhering to mucins and forming biofilms within the stagnant airway mucus layer, but how it survives remains to be elucidated. P. aeruginosa is metabolically versatile, being able to survive in nutrient poor environments, but currently no data explains how P. aeruginosa specifically survives in the airway. Preferentially chosen sources of nitrogen and carbon are known to come from amino acids and polyamines, but sugars such as glucose which is elevated in the CF airway are less preferred substrates, although efficiently metabolised via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. If preferred nutrients are offered in a mixture along with non-favoured carbon sources, catabolism of preferred substrates is regulated in an orderly fashion by catabolite repression control. Mucins are highly glycosylated polypeptides in abundance in the CF airway and may offer an alternative nutrient source to glucose. Understanding the specific nutrient source of Pseudomonas may allow identification of novel therapeutic targets to treat patients colonised with this organism.",

Currently the reasons for better growth on adult mucus remains to be explained since it was shown that although Pseudomonas can use glucose, it appears unable to use sugars within mucins as a nutrient source. Further work is needed to clarify whether Pseudomonas has the ability to grow on mucin protein, or growth is due to other factors within the CF airway which favour growth on adult mucus. Infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. P. aeruginosa develops MDR phenotypes during its persistence in CF airways accumulating pathoadaptive mutations. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help to identify and predict potential molecular mechanisms of resistance and has already proved to be able to predict antimicrobial susceptibility in several pathogens. Despite several WGS studies on P. aeruginosa CF lineages that have been published, the evolutionary trajectories in relation to the development of antimicrobial resistance remain mostly unexplored to date.",

This may reflect the chronic exposure of PA to several classes of antibiotics used in the management of CF airways infection.

J Clin Invest. 2012; 122:4145-59) . Activation of this receptor is predicted to lead to changes in ciliary beat frequency and nitric oxide production, which may enhance bacterial clearance. Three common polymorphisms exist in the gene coding for this receptor, altering the amino acid sequence at positions 49, 262, and 296 and correlating with receptor function; the functional allele has proline-alanine-valine (PAV) whereas the non-functional allele has alanine-valine-isoleucine (AVI) at these residues. In vitro response to QS molecules has been shown to be greatest in cells with the PAV/PAV genotype. We hypothesised that the T2R38 receptor may be important in host defence against Pa in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and that T2R38 genotype may therefore modify infection status and clinical outcomes.",

Whether these differences mean that fitter patients are more likely to clear Pa or that Pa clearance leads to better status cannot be determined. Further evaluation of this patient group, including measurement of Pa antibodies, is proposed, to explore the mechanisms underlying these differences and to identify patients who may be suitable for a trial of antibiotic withdrawal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infections affect 80% of adults with cystic fibrosis. Sodium nitrite inhibits bacterial respiration, and thus may provide a novel antimicrobial approach. However P. aeruginosa has a highly branched respiratory chain, and thus the precise targets of nitrosative stress are unclear. A transposon screen identified roxSR as a potential regulator of nitrite sensitivity. RoxSR encodes a two-component sensorkinase that regulates terminal oxidase expression in P. aeruginosa and may affect bacterial adaptation to nitrosative stress. Transcriptomic analysis was done with RNA sequencing to compare the roxSR strain to parental PAO1 in the presence and absence of sodium nitrite. In liquid, aerobic culture loss of roxSR leads to derepression of norCB, as well as misregulation of coxA. Exposure of PAO1 to nitrite leads to norCB as well as cbb3-type cytochrome oxidases. In contrast, roxSR strains do not further upregulate norCB (which was upregulated in unexposed cultures), and misregulate the cytochrome oxidases. These data suggest that roxSR, in addition to anr and dnr, may regulate denitrification. Because the cytochrome oxidases are the principal genes regulated by roxSR, the role of the specific cytochrome oxidases in nitrite sensitivity was examined. Nitrite sensitivity for strains deleted in combinations of the cytochrome oxidases were tested in both aerobic LB liquid culture and in the human bronchial epithelial cell line and Pseudomonas biofilm co-culture system that was previously described by Moreau-Marquis et al. The airway epithelial associated biofilms were treated with increasing concentrations of sodium nitrite. The roxSR strain was 2-fold more sensitive to nitrite than PAO1 under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Biotic biofilm formation was unimpaired, however resultant biofilms were more susceptible to growth inhibition by nitrite. In an acute mouse pneumonia model, C57BL6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PAO1 or roxSR. Bacteria were counted from the lung 24 hours later. Loss of roxSR leads to 3-4 log decrease in bacterial burden at 24 hours. In conclusion, the two-component system RoxSR is a key regulator of the P. aeruginosa response to nitrite in liquid culture and biotic biofilms, as well as being required for adaptation to growth in the mouse lung. In addition to known regulation of the terminal cytochrome oxidases, this TCS also likely regulates denitrification. Objective: Palivizumab is recommended to reduce hospitalizations in infants and children at high-risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. In children with CF there are potentially additional benefits of prevention of early RSV infection. Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend palivizumab for CF infants < 12 months of age with clinical evidence of chronic lung disease and/or nutritional compromise and in those < 24 months of age hospitalized in their first year of life for pulmonary exacerbations, with pulmonary radiographic abnormalities, or weight for length <10 th percentile. The effect of palivizumab on longer-term outcomes in children with CF is unknown. We used the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) to evaluate the potential impact of receiving palivizumab in infancy on clinical outcomes up to age 6 years.",

Compared to those not receiving palivizumab, infants receiving palivizumab had more signs and symptoms of CF; for example, prior to receipt of palivizumab, they had lower weight percentiles, higher prevalence of PA, more severe CFTR mutations, and more pancreatic enzyme use. Overall hospitalization rates were comparable in those who did and did not receive palivizubmab.

However, the data available in the Registry did not allow us to assess potential benefits of palivizumab specifically among infants with chronic lung disease or nutritional compromise.

Of the 92 children, there are 47 boys and 45 girls; 17 MI, 68 PI, and 7 PS; 34 out of 72 children used acid blocker during infancy. 25 (28%) out of 88 children were born by cesarean delivery. In 70 full-term and normal birth weight non-PS children, 17 were exclusively breastfed (eB) for \u22653mo, 18 for 1-3mo, and the remaining 35 received either eB for <1mo or partial breast milk or formula only. Overall, 18,746,552 sequences comprising 19,325 operational taxonomic units with 285 unique genera were identified. 59% of the total number of reads was presented by 16 genera. Among them, Bifidobacterium was the most abundant genus (21%), followed by Bacteroides (8%), streptococcus (5%), Blautia (4%), Veillonella, lactobacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Ruminococcus, Collinsella, Citrobacter, Parabacteroides, Dorea, Coprococcus, Klebsiella, and Haemophilus (all\u22643%) . The alpha diversity scores increased with age. The abundance of Bacteroides, Blautia, Collinsella, and Coprococcus increased with age, while Bifidobacterium and Veillonella decreased with age. Cesarean delivery was associated with decreased Parabacteroides in the 1 st y, decreased Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Klebsiella, and Haemophilus in the 2 nd , and decreased Veillonella and Klebsiella in the 3 rd y. Higher abundance of Haemophilus in the 2 nd and lactobacillus in the 3 rd y were associated with eB \u22653mo. Acid blocker use was associated with increased Collinsella in the 2 nd y.",

This suggests that annual review surveillance induced sputum is useful to identify important pathogens in children who are often asymptomatic, resulting in earlier initiation of eradication treatment and cohorting of children with pathogens, e.g. M. abscessus and B. cepacia, before they potentially infect other children in the clinic. The airways of patients with CF harbour rich communities of microbes or \"microbiota,\" the role of which is unclear. Studies in adults have demonstrated that decreased community diversity may be a marker of end-stage disease with little change seen with exacerbations (Zhao J, et al. PNAS 2012; 109:5809-14) . Greater longitudinal study of the microbiota in infancy is needed to identify early changes that could be targeted therapeutically to prevent the onset of advanced disease.

The cohort was composed of 40% F508del homozygous and 38% heterozygotes with a median FEV 1 % of 77.5% and FVC 99% predicted. A total of 219 sputum samples were assessed. Patients were categorized at 0-5 years as experiencing stable (28%), mild (30%) and severe lung function decline (42%). The groups did not differ with respect to proportion of cultured pathogens; PA (stable: 76.8%, mild: 76.7% and severe: 62.2%, P= 0.075) and Haemophilus influenzae (HI) (stable: 3.6%, mild: 12.3% and severe: 8.9%, P= 0.244), with the exception of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (stable: 50%, mild: 38.4% and severe: 58.9%, P= 0.032). There was a reduction (measured with observed estimator) in the alpha diversity between time periods 0 to 5 years in the severe group (P= 0.02), however, no difference was found for the stable and mild lung disease group. Based on the relative abundance the genera that was driving that reduction in the severe group included PA, HI, Prevotella, SA and Streptococcus (P adjusted < 0.05). Interestingly, when the rate of decline was calculated based on time 0 to 10 years, there was no longer a difference for the alpha diversity in the severe group (P=0.52). Comparison of the relative abundance among lung disease groups showed that PA, Rothia, Dialister, HI, Prevotella, SA, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus and Neisseria were driving the differences among the groups (P adjusted < 0.05). We determined that CF microbiome was clustered based on the FEV 1 % decline group (P= 0.009, Permanova).",

Introduction: Great efforts have been made at understanding how CF airways infections influence clinical outcomes in CF. However, two findings have dramatically changed our perception of infections: the recognition that P. aeruginosa (PA) strains have different clinical prognosis, and that a diverse community of organisms populate the airways (CF microbiome). Epidemic strains of PA (ePA) have been described for their multidrug resistance. Within our clinic an ePA has recently been described (the Prairie Epidemic Strain; PES) whose infections are associated with increased risk of exacerbations, rate of lung function decline, and progression to end-stage lung disease, compared to those with unique infections. Whereas earlier studies have proposed ePA have exaggerated virulence capacity we hypothesized that ePA may select for a more virulent lower airways community.",

Awareness of the CF Foundation (CFF) guidelines and adherence to CFF infection control guidelines practices is highly variable amongst patients and centers (Miroballi Y, et al.

Laboratorio Unidad de H\u00edgado, Hospital Universitario, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by progressive lung inflammation that is largely triggered by infection. Platelets participate significantly in inflammation and they can be activated by bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharide of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is the leading pathogen that infects CF patients and represents a determining factor for the deterioration of lung function and shortened survival. Early detection of the presence of this pathogen in CF airway is essential to establish early treatment and achieve elimination. The main problem is that young patients are not able to expectorate and therefore the identification of the bacteria is not always possible.",

Recent studies suggest that the polymicrobial nature of infections plays a key role in driving CF lung disease and, in turn, significantly impacts the clinical outcomes of patients. In children, S. aureus colonization/infection usually precedes chronic colonization of the respiratory tract by P. aeruginosa, and continues into adulthood, when it can be co-isolated with P. aeruginosa from CF respiratory cultures. To date, it is unclear whether and how S. aureus is an independent contributor to CF lung disease pathogenesis and its impact on the progression of P. aeruginosa chronic lung infection. Exploring this causal association in humans is complicated by confounding variables that cannot be controlled individually. We recently developed and characterized a murine model of P. aeruginosa infection reliably mimicking the course of human infection (Cigana C, et al. Sci Rep. 2016; 6:21465) . Here, we take advantage of this murine model to study the role of S. aureus in the pathogenesis and progression of P. aeruginosa lung disease.",

However, bacterial load, leukocyte recruitment and cytokines/chemokines levels peaked at 7 days and decreased at 21 days. The histopathological analysis at 7 days post-infection showed an initial formation of abscesses, similar to those observed in human lungs infected by S. aureus, that further increased at 21 days. At day 7, S. aureus-infected mice were superinfected with P. aeruginosa strains embedded in agar beads for 14 days. Pre-infection by S. aureus decreased the acute mortality induced by the highly virulent reference P. aeruginosa strain PA14 and the early CF clinical isolate AA2, and increased the number of mice progressing to P. aeruginosa chronic disease. In addition, S. aureus pre-infection increased the incidence of chronic infection established by the CF-adapted isolate AA43. Notably, the inflammatory response in terms of leukocyte recruitment and cytokines/chemokines production was similar in mice infected by P. aeruginosa, regardless of S. aureus pre-infection and abscesses formation.

It is characterized by antibiotic-tolerant biofilms in the endobronchial mucus with zones of oxygen (O 2 ) depletion mainly due to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activity. While the exact mechanisms affecting antibiotic effectiveness on biofilms remain unclear, accumulating evidence suggests that the efficiency of several bactericidal antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, is enhanced by stimulation of the aerobic respiration of pathogens and that lack of O 2 increases their tolerance. In fact, the bactericidal effect of several antibiotics requires bacterial metabolic activity and depends on the formation of reactive O 2 radicals (ROS). Re-oxygenation of O 2 -depleted biofilms may thus improve susceptibility to ciprofloxacin possibly by restoring aerobic respiration. Our aim is to sensitize anoxic biofilms of wild-type P. aeruginosa and a catalase-deficient mutant (\u0394katA) to create tolerance against ciprofloxacin by hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT).",

Furthermore, we intend to demonstrate if supplemental normobaric O 2 may enhance the activity of antibiotics. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease caused by a defective CFTR leading to impaired chloride and bicarbonate ion transport. This defect leads to accumulation of dense, intractable mucus, which makes patients more susceptible to chronic lung infections.

This colonisation, predominately as a biofilm, correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as increased resistance to antimicrobials. Novel therapies that are effective against P. aeruginosa are therefore urgently required. The alginate OligoG CF-5/20 has been shown to inhibit pseudomonal motility and biofilm assemby. Motility in P. aeruginosa PAO1 is regulated by signalling pathways such as Las and Rhl, and these pathways are environmentally and temporally regulated. We hypothesised that OligoG CF-5/20 affects signalling pathways in P. aeruginosa.",

A time course (12, 18, 24 and 30 h) of OligoG CF-5/20 (0.2-10%)-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures in Mueller-Hinton (MH) was used to study virulence factor (pyocyanin, rhamnolipids, elastase, protease) production using spectrophotometric assays.

Stability of the microbiome will be assessed during initiation of inhaled antibiotic therapy. Bronchoscopic assessment of the lower airway microbiome may illustrate discrepencies between lower airway microbiota and sputum. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogens have been observed to live in multicellular aggregates in CF airways. Key infection characteristics, including noninvasive behaviour and treatment resistance, have been attributed to aggregated growth. Bacterial aggregation is typically thought to result from active self-assembly mechanisms akin to those observed in in vitro biofilm. However, many CF clinical isolates are unable to form biofilms in vitro and biofilm formation genes are frequent targets for inactivating mutations during in-host evolution. Furthermore, bacteria in CF airways may not be surface attached, so a key biofilm-initiating signal may be absent. These observations raise the possibility that in vivo aggregation may occur by mechanisms that are independent of biofilm formation.",

CF airways are rich in host polymers, such as mucin and DNA, and polymers can cause particles to aggregate via a crowding mechanism called depletion aggregation. When particles aggregate, more volume is available to the polymers, maximizing the entropy of the system. We incubated P. aeruginosa in both synthetic (PEG) and disease relevant (mucin+DNA) polymers and found that bacteria spontaneously aggregated. The relationship between bacterial numbers, polymer concentration, and aggregation; and the lateral arrangement of bacteria within aggregates indicated that both PEG and host polymers caused aggregation by the depletion mechanism. We also found that depletion aggregation promoted tolerance to multiple antibiotics within 15 minutes of aggregate formation. Control experiments indicated that polymers did not inactivate antibiotics and that aggregation was responsible for the tolerance phenotype. Furthermore, depletion aggregation promoted tolerance in strains where biofilm formation was disabled, indicating that active biofilm assembly functions are not required. When aggregates were dispersed, tolerance was retained in dispersed bacteria for 15 minutes. However, dispersed bacteria became sensitive to antibiotics 60 minutes after dispersion.",

            "text": "The fact that tolerance to multiple antibiotic classes developed rapidly and persisted for a time after aggregates were dispersed raised the possibility that depletion aggregation may induce tolerance-promoting stress responses. Because of its role in producing antibiotic tolerance, we initially focused on the SOS response, which is induced by a variety of environmental stresses. Studies with a fluorescent gene expression reporter indicated that the SOS response was induced within aggregates. Furthermore, inactivation of the SOS response or SOS-regulated genes that induce growth arrest markedly reduced aggregate-mediated tolerance. Together, these results suggest that polymer-rich environments, such as CF airway secretions, may promote bacterial aggregation via the depletion mechanism, resulting in stress-induced growth arrest, and antibiotic tolerance.

The leading cause of death in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is respiratory failure due to chronic respiratory infections. There has been an increase in CF patients exhibiting chronic MRSA infections which are associated with an increased rate of lung function decline, failure to recover from acute pulmonary exacerbations and an increase in mortality (Dasenbrook EC, et al. JAMA. 2010; 303:2386-92) . MRSA infects young CF patients and often grows as biofilms which are more resistant than their wild-type counterparts to antimicrobial therapy and clearance by the immune system. Even though MRSA infections are devastating clinically, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how dysfunctional immunity in the CF lung hampers bacterial clearance. The objectives of this study are: 1) to perform longitudinal sampling of CF patients to measure changes correlated with the ability of MRSA isolates to form biofilm, and 2) to determine the effect of CFTR mutations on the ability of macrophages to phagocytose and kill MRSA.",

There was a 35% decrease in the amount of viable MRSA recovered at t=0 in the CFTRinh-172 treated macrophages compared to untreated macrophages. Compared to MRSA recovery at t=0, there was approximately 50% reduction in viable MRSA recovered from untreated macrophages at t=2, suggesting killing of intracellular bacteria by untreated macrophages. However, the amount of MRSA recovered at t=2 by CFTRinh-172 treated macrophages was not different from t=0, suggesting that CFTRinh-172 treatment inhibited bacterial killing. These results suggest that deficient CFTR activity in macrophages may inhibit both phagocytosis and killing of MRSA which may contribute to the development of chronic MRSA infections in CF patients. Introduction: Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) represents a classification of genetically related bacteria found to infect cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Infection with Bcc leads to a spectrum of clinically relevant disease ranging from asymptomatic colonization of unclear significance to necrotizing pneumonia with rapid loss of lung function and death, however its presence portends a worsened prognosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) has similar characteristics in this regard, but can be successfully eradicated using a protocol-based approach when detected early. To date, a standardized antibiotic eradication protocol for treatment of Bcc infection has not been described.",

The long-term clinical effect of Bcc eradication in CF patients is of unclear significance and requires further evaluation. A multicenter study utilizing a protocol for Bcc eradication should be considered. In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the detection of respiratory pathogens is a primary clinical and microbiological concern. Culture-independent 16S rRNA gene microbiome sequencing has demonstrated improved comprehensiveness and sensitivity compared to routine culture in CF sputum samples, but has not been systematically compared to culture for detection of these pathogens. Furthermore, positive molecular tests in culturenegative samples are of unclear significance. Our objective was to systematically compare 16S rRNA gene sequencing and culture in 77 pediatric CF patients for six pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. Microbiome profiling identified pathogens in 99.1% and 73.7% of culture-positive and negative samples respectively. Culture-positivity was associated with a significantly greater relative abundance (RA) of the genus, with culture-positive samples having an average RA nearly 50-fold greater than culture-negative samples.

P. aeruginosa strain PA14 is a clinical isolate that is closely related phylogenetically to other clinical isolates, but shows a high level of virulence compared to several well studied P. aeruginosa strains, especially strain PAO1. The virulence phenotype of PA14 is linked to its endotoxin profile, pili structure, pathogenicity islands composition, type III secretion system (TTSS) activity, and cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells. Strain PA14 also shows distinct profiles of antibiotic resistance with respect to other commonly studied strains of P. aeruginosa.

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that chronically infects approximately 80% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by early adulthood, accounting for the majority of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The development of chronic P. aeruginosa infections in the CF lung involves the formation of highly recalcitrant biofilm communities. Clinical observations have noted acquisition of chronic P. aeruginosa infection by CF patients often occurs during respiratory viral seasons, with up to 85% of new P. aeruginosa colonization occurring within 3 weeks following a respiratory viral infection (Johansen HK, Hoiby N. Thorax. 1992; 47:109-11; Collinson J, et al. Thorax. 1996; 51:1115-22) . Although the mechanism underlying this interaction in the CF lung is not well understood, we have recently shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) co-infection stimulates increased biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa on airway epithelial cells (AECs) through a mechanism that is dependent on the apical release of the host iron-binding protein transferrin, suggesting that nutritional immunity is compromised in AECs during RSV co-infection (Hendricks MR, et al. PNAS. 2016; 113:1642-7) . However, the mechanism by which transferrin is released from AECs during respiratory viral infection remains undefined. Transferrin mRNA and protein levels are not altered in AECs during RSV infection, suggesting an alternative mechanism of secretion. We hypothesized that respiratory viral infection alters transferrin trafficking within AECs and allows its apical secretion, thereby promoting P. aeruginosa biofilm biogenesis. We show in these studies that extracellular vesicles released apically from AECs during RSV co-infection enhanced P. aeruginosa biofilm growth. Extracellular vesicles had significantly increased levels of iron and chelation of iron from the extracellular vesicles reduced their ability to stimulate P. aeruginosa biofilm growth. Interestingly, RSV infection enhanced the transcytosis and apical secretion of transferrin originating from the basolateral compartment of cells, loaded onto extracellular vesicles. Together these results suggest RSV infection redirects transferrin trafficking in AECs, resulting in the loading of transferrin onto apically released extracellular vesicles, which can be utilized as an iron source by P. aeruginosa to form biofilms. We are currently investigating the pathways by which RSV infection induces transferrin packaging and secretion in extracellular vesicles to stimulate P. aeruginosa biofilm growth. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which the host response to viral infection contributes to the development of chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection and provide mechanistic insight into our understanding of nutritional immunity in the lung.

Synedgen, Inc., Claremont, CA, USA Background: Limited therapeutic options, enhanced virulence properties, and phenotypic adaptations, such as biofilm formation, contribute to a lack of effective therapies for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung biofilm infection, associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Only recently it was determined that NTM or more specifically Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) strains form biofilms in the CF lung during chronic infection, contributing to rapid clinical deterioration due to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Thick mucus and biofilm formation in the CF lung can render therapeutics less effective. A series of nontoxic derivatized polyglucosamines shown to be broadly active at dermal and mucosal interfaces encompass a newly developed class of molecules designated poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG). Specifically, the PAAG15A derivative is a nontoxic, soluble, biopolymer shown to potentiate a wide range of antibiotics against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and to effectively dissolve biofilms, including those of MABSC. The minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay and stationary tissue culture plate biofilm assays were used to examine the removal of biofilms formed by several clinical isolates of MABSC associated with cystic fibrosis, respectively. These studies demonstrate the ability of PAAG15A to disrupt MABSC biofilms with the goal of supporting more effective treatments.",

These studies show that NTM biofilms are removed by PAAG15A in a dose-dependent manner. The biofilm dissolving activity of PAAG15A may result in more positive therapeutic outcomes, particularly in cystic fibrosis-related NTM infections. Results: 32 patients were identified. Median age at presentation was 30 (range from 12-78). There were 14 males and 18 females. 16/32 were double-\u0394F508 (50%). 25/32 had pancreatic insufficiency, 5 were pancreatic sufficient. 10/32 were diabetic. Of the MABSC isolates, 14/32 were subspecies abscessus, 3 were subspecies massieliense, and the remaining 15 were unknown. 10 patients were coinfected with MAC and 9 with Aspergillus fumigatus. A functional erm gene was present in isolates from 15 patients rendering them clarithromycin resistant. Patients received combinations of parenteral imipenem/amikacin/cefoxitin/inhaled amikacin/oral zyvox/clarithromycin for an average of 12 months. 6 patients have died of advanced CF lung disease, 1 received a lung transplant, and the rest are alive and well on or off therapy. The microbiological responses were divided into: group 1) having 3 negative cultures and no positive cultures; group 2) transient negative then positive cultures; group 3) never negative, countable colonies; group 4) persistent smear and culture positivity. The patient distribution within these subgroups is summarized in the Table. Conclusions: Knowing the subspecies of MABSC and presence of a functional erm gene is critical in the therapeutic algorithm of MABSC infection in CF. These factors determine the true morbidity of MABSC infection in CF. Background: At East Tennessee Children's Hospital, our patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) routinely undergo bronchoscopy to obtain definitive endobronchial cultures that guide antibiotic therapy. However, the standard practice in many cystic fibrosis centers is to use less invasive procedures; the CF Foundation asserts that there is not enough evidence to recommend bronchoscopy for routine culture and therefore recommends routine oropharygeal (OP) cultures in individuals with CF (Mogayzel Jr, P, et al. Annals of the ATS 2014;11:1640-50).",

Conclusions: Based on the results of this data analysis, we feel that continuing the practice of routine bronchoscopy is appropriate and results in better recovery of pathogenic organisms. Not only do we see a high percentage of discrepancy between the cultures obtained in CF clinic and cultures obtained during bronchoscopy, but a majority of those differences are also considered to be clinically significant; ie, the patient would be treated with different antibiotics. There are several limitations in this analysis, however; for example, it is unknown if the patient was exposed to new pathogens or treated with oral antibiotics during the time from clinic visit to bronchoscopy. We feel that a prospective study design is warranted to further determine the validity and significance of these findings in addition to investigating the differences in specific pathogens. In this analysis, the percentage of discrepancy is relatively consistent regardless of age group and the method of initial culture. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of the CF airway are associated with decreased lung function, increased hospitalizations and shorter lifespan. P. aeruginosa is naturally antibiotic resistant, making it difficult to treat with conventional therapies. Furthermore, this pathogen regularly augments its survival strategies by forming surface-associated groups or aggregates known as biofilms that are highly tolerant to antibiotics. Another strategy involves the formation of metabolically repressed cells that resist antibiotic killing, known as persisters. Hence, complete clearance of P. aeruginosa in chronic infections via antibiotic therapy is often impossible.",

These additional species were tested with the inhibitor in mono-and poly-microbial infection settings on airway cells. As expected, the inhibitor showed little to no effect on the virulence of the other species grown either planktonically or in biofilm, demonstrating the specificity of our compound. Importantly, the inhibitor's efficacy at reducing P. aeruginosa virulence was not diminished by the presence of the other species, suggesting that the polymicrobial nature of CF infections should not be an obstacle for this therapeutic. These studies also revealed interesting interspecies interactions with P. aeruginosa in biofilm infections. Our biofilm and polymicrobial infection preliminary results indicate M64 may serve as a valuable therapeutic for the treatment of CF lung infections. Efforts to assess this inhibitor's efficacy in vivo are ongoing. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel, plays critical roles in phagocytic host defense. However, how activated neutrophils regulate CFTR channel distribution subcellularly is not well defined. To address this issue, multiple antibodies against different CFTR domains were tested to examine CFTR expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils by flow cytometry. The data confirmed that resting neutrophils had pronounced CFTR expression. Activation of neutrophils in vitro with soluble or particulate agonists did not significantly increase CFTR expression level, but induced CFTR redistribution to cell surface. Such CFTR mobilization correlated with cell-surface recruitment of formyl peptide receptor during secretory vesicle exocytosis. Intriguingly, neutrophils from \u0394F508-CFTR patients, despite expression of the mutant CFTR, showed little cell-surface mobilization upon stimulation. While normal neutrophils effectively targeted CFTR to their phagosomes, \u0394F508-CFTR neutrophils had impairment in that process, resulting in deficient hypochlorous acid (HOCl) production. Taken together, activated neutrophils regulate CFTR distribution by targeting this chloride channel to the subcellular sites of activation, and \u0394F508-CFTR neutrophils fail to achieve such targeting, thus undermining their host defense function. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of CF patients who received a lung transplant at our institution from 2002 to 2016 to determine the prevalence of fungal lung isolates prior to transplant and their impact on the incidence of invasive fungal infection in the first month after transplantation.

Pharmacy, Intermountain Primary Children's Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT, USA Introduction: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging opportunistic pathogen affecting cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry reported an average annual increase of 1.4% in CF sputum isolates from 2006 to 2012. Colonization with S. maltophilia in CF patients has been independently associated with decline in % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, acute pulmonary exacerbation (APE) hospitalizations, lung transplantation, and increased mortality. There are many barriers with S. maltophilia treatment, including multidrug resistance requiring a combination of multiple antibiotics. Currently, there are limited published studies and no treatment guidelines to aid clinicians in selecting antibiotics for APEs due to S. maltophilia infection.",

This study highlights the need for further clinical research and clinical practice guidelines in CF patients infected with S. maltophilia. The first line of host defense of the airway, the epithelium, can be compromised by the absence of CFTR function. However, it has been challenging to explain how the loss of CFTR function can induce excessive lung inflammation and how the robust inflammatory response cannot defend CF patients from bacterial infection. While CF airway epithelial cells clearly contribute to the proinflammatory environment of the CF airway they do not adequately explain the failure of CF patients' innate immune response to kill and clear bacteria. Identifying and understanding other relevant components of the innate host defense system and their regulation in CF patients will be beneficial for design and implementation of future therapeutics.",

The views of the cystic fibrosis (CF) community on optimal infection control practices have evolved over the years. In the past, it was thought that patients with CF rarely acquired organisms from other CF patients. More recent data suggests patient-to-patient transmission is possible. There is increasing evidence that implementation of strict infection control practices in CF clinics and inpatient units can decrease the spread of pathogenic bacteria. The 2013 update to the Infection Prevention and Control Guideline for CF reflects this emerging viewpoint on organism transmission in CF.

Ongoing data collection and analysis are being performed to determine if significant decreases will occur over time. National data analysis is needed to determine if the results of this single center study can be generalized. Progressive loss of lung function due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa infection is typically concurrent with colonization by oral microbiota and followed by secondary infection with other bacterial and fungal pathogens such as Burkholderia and Aspergillus species. Highdensity P. aeruginosa populations such as those found in the CF airways produce significant concentrations of secreted metabolites, including at least 50 quinolone-based small molecules. One of the most highly abundant of these is HQNO, which is detected at micromolar concentrations in CF sputum. Here we show that physiological levels of HQNO suppress innate immune function. Although the dysfunction in mechanical clearance in the CF airway is well characterized, CF patients also seem to have ill-defined deficiencies in innate immune cell function as they have difficulty eradicating pathogens from the airway despite the presence of high numbers of phagocytes. Innate immune cells kill extracellular bacteria via phagocytosis and a subsequent oxidative burst in the phagosome through the production of high levels of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phagocytosis and oxidative burst are activated by toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in response to pathogens, and activated phagocytes undergo a dramatic metabolic shift in order to generate the energy and reducing potential required to sustain a bactericidal oxidative burst. Stimulation of TLRs by pathogens induces the metabolic shift required by phagocytes to produce NO and ROS through activation of the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Here we show that treating macrophages with physiological levels of HQNO inhibits oxidative burst and prevents phagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa, Burkholderia multivorans, and Staphylococcus aureus. Our data show that treating macrophages with HQNO prevents the activation of mTOR by TLR agonists. In host cells mTOR is negatively regulated by AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which is a central sensor of cellular energy stress through increased AMP:ATP ratio. The primary source of ATP in eukaryotic cells is oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial membrane. As HQNO has previously been described as an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, we tested the effect of physiological HQNO concentrations on mitochondrial activity. Our data show that HQNO is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial activity, causing hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species within the mitochondria indicating loss of mitochondrial function. Finally, we show that mTOR inhibition by HQNO is dependent on AMPK activation. In summary, HQNO induces AMPK activation, thereby inhibiting mTOR activation and bactericidal activity in phagocytes. We propose that HQNO produced by P. aeruginosa is a significant contributor to morbidity in CF patients by enhancing the immune defects in CF airways leading to further colonization by P. aeruginosa and secondary pathogens. Background: Infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that frequently occupies the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, is associated with lung inflammation that is characterized by the accumulation of neutrophils in the airspace and mucosal tissue damage. Neutrophil migration across the lung epithelium is amplified by leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an eicosanoid produced by neutrophils during the breach of infected mucosa. LTB4 is derived from arachidonic acid, which is produced by the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity of cPLA2\u03b1. The bacterial toxin ExoU exhibits PLA2 activity as well through a conserved patatin domain.",

Treatment of NTM lung disease is challenging, with limited numbers of active antibiotics and requirements for long courses of potentially toxic drugs. New strategies are desperately needed to improve efficacy of treatment regimens. Recent research with the related mycobacterial pathogen, M. tuberculosis (MTB) has demonstrated that expression of bacterial efflux pumps by MTB within macrophages contributes to both intracellular survival and antibiotic tolerance. Furthermore when verapamil (VER), which acts as an efflux pump inhibitor, is added to standard regimens in an MTB mouse model, it can shorten duration of treatment and reduce risk of relapse. These results in MTB led us to ask whether efflux pumps can serve as a new target for treatment of NTM pathogens.",

We also used broth microdilution to determine MICs for multiple antibiotics in the absence and presence of efflux pump inhibitors and did not see significant shifts in the MICs suggesting that VER cannot counteract intrinsic resistance to these antibiotics. We are currently using a THP-1 infection model to determine whether NTM pathogens develop macrophage-induced tolerance, and if so whether VER can inhibit this tolerance.

Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes buildup of thick mucus in the lungs and airways of patients, leading to prolonged infection. Before the widespread use of antibiotics later in the 20th century, patients succumbed to infections from Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and other common members of the oral microbiota. Now, life expectancy has grown dramatically, and CF patients develop persistent infections with slow-growing, antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia spp. Elucidating the available nutrients and the interactions between bacterial strains within the polymicrobial communities in the airways is essential for understanding persistent infections and patient outlook. We are interested in studying the metabolic interactions and nutrient flow between our clinical isolates Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Rothia mucilaginosa, dominant and long-term residents of the CF polymicrobial community. By performing gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on mono-and co-cultures, we were able to characterize molecules present in the interaction between our two clinical isolates. R. mucilaginosa produces metabolites consumed by P. aeruginosa, and may provoke the production of toxic molecules. For example, fermentation products such as 2,3-butanedione provoke P. aeruginosa to produce more phenazines, which are toxic and can generate reactive oxygen species in the presence of oxygen, and may also act as an alternative electron acceptor in a low oxygen environment. A combination of metabolomics data and hypothesis-driven experiments to better understand the interaction between P. aeruginosa and R. mucilaginosa will be presented.",

Introduction: Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multiple breath washout (MBW) may be sensitive methods to monitor cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Studies assessing treatment responses in acute pulmonary exacerbations (aPEs) have shown a heterogeneous response in the lung clearance index (LCI), the main outcome measure of MBW, with a significant proportion of patients showing worsening of LCI with treatment (Sonneveld N et al.

In this pilot study, improved mucus plugging and trapped air on CF-MRI correlated with worsening LCI. These findings suggest that opening up poorly ventilated areas of the lung with treatment affects the LCI measurement and may explain the previously reported heterogeneous response in LCI with treatment of aPEs. Sensitive clinical tools to assess subtle changes in lung structure and function are essential for assessing disease progression and therapeutic efficacy in early CF lung disease. Spirometry is the clinical gold-standard for measuring lung function but is known to be somewhat insensitive and effort-dependent. Lung clearance index (LCI) via multiple-breath washout is emerging as a sensitive biomarker for ventilation heterogeneity, and recently, we demonstrated that hyperpolarized 129 Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was sensitive to ventilation deficits in CF patients with clinically-normal spirometry (ie, FEV 1 ).

Phase IV values and normal arterial oxygen saturations, however, suggest regional inhomogeneity and V/Q matching. Higher values in CF children than adults suggest that decreased airway oxygen levels may arise from bronchiectasis, inflammation and/or infection, though there is also evidence that oxygen consumption is increased in CF epithelial cells (Worlitzsch D, et al.) . The data raise several questions about the physiology, ontogeny and airway ecology of airway oxygen tensions in CF. The data are partially consistent with the idea that oxygen tensions may favor the growth of mucoid Pseudomonas and anaerobic bacteria in the CF airways. If so, low-dose oxygen therapy might be considered for its antimicrobial value. Objective: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with high rates of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) leading to an accelerated decline in lung function, impaired quality of life, increased inpatient (IP) admissions, and premature mortality. In clinical trials of patients with CF gating mutations, ivacaftor (IVA) treatment has been associated with reductions in PEx.

Pediatrics, State Univ. of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA; 2. Biostatistics, State Univ. of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA Background: Lung clearance index (LCI) is a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity based on tidal breathing, is increased in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to normal subjects (Subbarao P, et al. Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2015; 12:392-9) . and has been shown to improve (decrease) after treatment for CF pulmonary exacerbations (Robinson PD, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2009; 44:733-42) . Forced maneuvers generate FEV 1 % predicted, which usually improves (increases) during the same treatment period (Horsley AR, et al. Thorax. 2013; 68:532-9) ; however, the expected inverse correlation in FEV 1 % predicted and LCI is not always seen (Sonneveld N, et al. Eur Respir J. 2015; 46:1055-64) . Patient satisfaction with LCI has not been previously reported. We aimed to compare the change in LCI to the change in FEV 1 % predicted before and after treatment for CF pulmonary exacerbation and to compare patient satisfaction with LCI compared to standard pulmonary function testing (PFT).",

Cystic fibrosis patients suffer from recurrent episodes of deterioration called acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE). Treatment of an APE includes IV antibiotic therapy, airway clearance therapy, and exercise. Aminoglycosides (AG) are frequently used to treat common pathogens associated with an APE (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which have been known to cause ototoxicity. Currently there are no specific guideline recommendations on screening for aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) guidelines recommend periodic assessments for ototoxicity, but do not provide specific recommendations on the types and frequency of audiology screening.",

The ability of ventilation distribution outcomes predict exacerbations or monitor treatment needs to be assessed. Introduction: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a recognized complication of advanced lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The exact prevalence is unknown given the invasive nature of cardiac catheterization; the gold standard method of diagnosing PAH. Early detection and management of PAH could improve outcomes in CF patients. The diameter of the main pulmonary artery (mPA) and the ascending aorta (Ao) can be readily measured on chest CT scans where both an enlarged mPA and an increased mPA:Ao ratio have been associated with PAH. In adults, the cut-off for the mPA:Ao ratio in healthy subjects has been found to be 1, with ratio exceeding 1 being indicative of PAH. Recent data from our institution suggest that the upper limit of normal for this ratio is higher in children than in adults (1) .",

Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common pathogen in patients with CF and frequently the target of antibiotic therapy for pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). Standard of care is for clinicians to monitor sputum cultures to drive antibiotic choices. However, there is poor correlation between drug susceptibility test (DST) results and clinical outcome of treatment for PEx. Since 2015, our center has limited DST for PA to only once annually.

Our findings demonstrate no significant difference in QTc based on CAT, however the cumulative number of QTPD should be monitored with caution. Future multicenter studies should be considered to validate these findings. Objectives: CF patients are exposed to repeated x-ray and computed tomography (CT) examinations which may be problematic due to the cumulative radiation dose. Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appears as a promising alternative to CT and new methods such as ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI have improved lung imaging quality. To avoid motion corruption of the images, breath holding or prospective gating of the acquisition to end expiration is usually used. Breath hold duration limits the acquisition duration and spatial coverage or resolution. Retrospective gating allows reconstruction of images in multiple phases of the respiratory cycle. In this work, we studied a new method to retrospectively sort the data acquired during free breathing to obtain whole-lung coverage with a high isotropic spatial resolution. Diagnostic performance of this new MRI technique was compared to that of CT.",

Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder and a clinical diagnosis characterized by an urge to move legs, or other body parts that begins, or worsens during rest or inactivity, is relieved by movement, and occurs primarily in the evening. The prevalence is 7-11% in the generalized population, but higher in chronic medical conditions like rheumatological disorders and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Iron deficiency, and dysfunctions in iron metabolism and dopamine regulation are hypothesized to play a role in the disease pathogenesis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) leads to multisystem disease including chronic inflammatory lung disease. RLS has a wide range of severity from mere annoyance to severe enough disturbance in sleep and quality of life to warrant treatment. Sleep complaints are common in CF patients.

Spirometry is easy to obtain, reproducible and poses minimal risks to the patient. Linear modeling of lung function and generation of lung function quantiles have been useful in assessing genomic/genetic disease risk. However, linear modeling is less useful in studies that require short-term modeling of lung function such as metabolomics and metagenomic investigations. We modeled FEV1 changes with median quantile splines, captured the variation in these splines using 9 variables and then created lung function dynamic phenotypes.",

The values of the median spline as well as the first and second derivative were calculated for each of these intervals. For each patient the following variables were calculated: a) the effective degrees of freedom of the spline; b) the number of local maxima and minima of the spline, first derivative and second derivative; c) the range between the 5th and 95th percentile values of the spline, first derivative and second derivative; d) the median value of the first and second derivatives. After correlating these 9 variables with clinical parameters, classes of the dynamic lung function variables were created and correlated with clinical phenotypes using published protocols (Conrad DJ, Bailey BA. PLoS One. 2015;10(3):e0122705). These were then correlated to physiological, clinical variables and clinical phenotypes.",

FEV1 dynamic classes were then generated with these nine variables forming 3 groups with classification error rates of about 10%. This strategy identified stable, intermediate and hypervariable FEV1 dynamic phenotypes. The stable FEV1 dynamic phenotype was seen more frequently than expected in a CF clinical phenotype D which is a male-dominated phenotype with excellent lung function and nutritional status. The intermediate and hypervariable phenotypes were seen in two female-dominated clinical phenotype groups with either good lung function (clinical phenotype C) and worse FEV1 (clinical phenotype E).

Gene Therapy, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom Background: Early detection of organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in CF is essential for successful eradication. Detection, however, is difficult in nonexpectorating children as it relies largely on cough swabs (C/S) with suboptimal sensitivity and specificity (UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust Antibiotic Working Group, 2009, 3rd ed) . C/S are also not very useful in detecting nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (Ahmed B, et al. Arch Dis Child. 2012; 97:854-5) . Sputum induction (SI) has been found to be safe, feasible, and have a higher rate of positive bacterial culture than same-day C/S (Jochmann A, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; doi:10.1002/ ppul.23366) . We are increasingly using SI in nonexpectorating children both to detect infection and assess the response to an eradication intervention.",

No growth on SI is a good predictor of successful eradication of PA following antibiotic therapy at 3 months. SI is thus a useful test and should be incorporated into the clinical management armory for both the deteriorating patient and after eradication therapy having informed clinical management in almost half of the patients referred. Introduction: Pulmonary exacerbations are common in children with CF and are frequently treated in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. There are limited data detailing characteristics of these exacerbations and changes that occur with oral antibiotics. We sought to prospectively determine changes in lung function and sputum bacterial colony counts in a cohort of children with CF treated with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting for a pulmonary exacerbation.",

Spirometry, pre-and post-bronchodilator, was performed and a sputum sample, expectorated or induced, was obtained for quantitative microbiology and viral testing. All subjects completed two weeks of oral antibiotics. A second visit was performed within one week of completing antibiotics and spirometry and quantitative sputum microbiology were repeated. We intend to capture pre-and post-exacerbation data from 30 subjects.",

The median baseline FEV 1 based on the highest FEV 1 in the 6 months prior to the first visit, was 95% predicted, which is comparable to the median FEV 1 for patients 6 to 17 years of age at our CF center (95.2%). At exacerbation onset, the median FEV 1 for this cohort was 84% predicted, representing a median decrease in FEV 1 of 10% predicted prior to antibiotic therapy (range: -45% to 4%, p <0.01). FEV 1 improved by a median of 10% predicted (range: -8% to 31%, p < 0.01) at completion of treatment. FEV 1 percent predicted did not improve to 95% or greater of baseline FEV 1 values in 7 out of 21 subjects (95% CI: 13.2-53.5%). Viruses were identified in 8 subjects (36% of samples, 95% CI: 16.3-56.5%). The primary bacteria identified on sputum culture were methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (50%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (23%), and Haemophilus influenzae (9%). Quantitative microbiology culture results are available for fifteen subjects at the two time points. In these subjects, density of the dominant-detected bacteria decreased by 0.82 log 10 cfu/mL (-8 log 10 to 2 log 10 , p=0.07).",

Nursing, Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA Background: Imaging has the potential to be a powerful tool in the care and monitoring of CF patients. Quantitative MRI holds promise as a safe, noninvasive method for performing measurements of lung disease. One major challenge for MRI in the lungs is artifacts caused by respiration motion. Manual breathholds are typically used to limit motion artifacts, but can be impractical in patients with advanced lung disease or in infants. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF), a novel quantitative MRI method, has demonstrated motion insensitivity in both clinical and preclinical applications (Ma D, et al. Nature. 2013; 495:187-92; Gao Y, et al. NMR Biomed. 2015; 28:384-94) . In this study, we evaluate the MRFbased dictionary matching process with respect to reducing the impact of respiratory motion artifacts in MRI quantification.",

Importantly, these results suggest the opportunity of using a dictionary-based matching process for accurate quantification during free-breathing MRI studies which could directly limit the need for anesthesia in patients. Background: L/I improves lung function and reduces exacerbation frequency in patients homozygous for F508del; however, worsening respiratory symptoms have been reported in some individuals. In addition, there is a lack of data in patients with severe lung disease (predicted FEV 1 \u226440%).

Twelve (43%) patients subjectively noted slight increased work of breathing or chest tightness following the first Orkambi dose with improvement after albuterol administration. There was no observed change in the median peak flow or Borg score; however, five patients (18%) experienced PF reductions (range 4-12% decrease) and symptoms requiring albuterol administration. Increases in Borg scores (0. 5-1.5) were noted in 4 patients (14%). All patients went home with full dose or FDA-approved dosage adjustment based on DDIs or hepatic impairment. Ten (36%) patients have discontinued L/I, 3 (30%) of which were initial patients who started Orkambi and did not undergo any observed dosing. The other 7 (70%) patients discontinued due to: rash and swelling of the face, respiratory intolerance vs exacerbation, compliance to lab follow-up and appointments, increased anxiety, and 3 with persistent respiratory intolerance/tightness to lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Discontinuation of L/I was greatest in patients with severe lung disease (5 of 7 patients with FEV 1 \u226440%).",

Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA; 2. Chemical and Life Science Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA Rationale: Despite aggressive therapy for pulmonary exacerbations, the overall course of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is relentless progression. CF lung disease severity directly correlates with airway neutrophil elastase (NE) activity. The current paradigm is that sputum NE is decreased following treatment for pulmonary exacerbations. However, published reports demonstrate that inhaled dornase increases NE activity in CF sputum. Therefore, increased mucolytic therapy during treatment for pulmonary exacerbations may paradoxically increase NE activity promoting CF lung disease progression.",

Sputum was thawed and divided for rheology and biomarker analysis. Rheological analysis was performed on a DHR-3 stress-controlled rheometer (TA instruments) using a 2-mm aluminum parallel plate geometry at 25\u00b0C. The viscous (G'') and elastic (G') moduli at 1% strain and 1 rad/s were reported. For NE analysis, sputum was diluted with normal saline (1:1; W:V), mixed, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2h, and centrifuged. NE activity was quantified in the supernatant by spectrophotometric assay using the NE substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-P-nitroanalide. To test whether mucolytic or hyperosmolar therapies affect NE activity, additional sputum samples were diluted with normal saline with or without dornase alfa (0.01-0.3 mg/m:), or hypertonic saline (HS; 3.5 and 7% NaCl) or mannitol (3.5%) (W:V) and sputum supernatant NE activity was measured. To our knowledge the impact of hyperosmolar therapies, including HS and mannitol, on NE activity in sputum has not previously been reported.",

Subjects were included if they had at least one FEV1 measurement and were between 6 and 40 years of age. The first stable FEV1 measurement per person per year was used. Post-lung transplant FEV1 measurements were excluded. Quantile regression was used to model each %ile of FEV1 as a function of age and/or height, stratified by sex. Lung disease progression was compared using FEV1 %iles vs FEV1 % predicted (FEV1 pp) using the GLI reference norms. Canadian CF-FEV1 %iles were compared to US %iles for the period 2001-2006. Results: 4,289 subjects (46.5% female) were included in the study, contributing to 36,727 measurements taken between 2000-2014. FEV1 increases exponentially during childhood and adolescence and declines in adulthood (Figure) . Peak FEV1 was reached earlier for females than males. Improvement in FEV1 percentiles for the population as a whole was seen in the more recent time period (2008-2014) compared to 2000-2007. These improvements over time were more dramatic in those with FEV1 measurements below the 50th percentile as well as in males (Figure) . In selected subjects, FEV1 pp masked changes in disease progression that were evident when using FEV1 percentiles. Canadian CF patients had higher FEV1 %iles compared to US patients during [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] . The difference in FEV1 %iles can be seen as early as 6 years of age and increases in the lower %iles and in males.",

Only 7% of specialists were involved in basic science but nearly three of five were involved in clinical investigations. Most of respondents' clinical time was spent in subspecialty care; few provided primary care. CF was a common diagnosis seen; more than 70% of respondents reported being part of an accredited CF center. Flexible bronchoscopy, lung function tests and telephone consultations for home care were common procedures and activities. Most clinicians in the survey confined their practices to pediatrics, but nearly one in twenty also saw adults. Nearly 90% were affiliated with a medical school. More than half of those surveyed would like to add colleagues in the next three years. A substantial proportion of respondents felt that there would be jobs available in the future, but that insufficient funding of these new positions would make it difficult for them to be filled.

It is clear that the pediatric pulmonary workforce is aging. Although newborn screening has helped identify CF patients before lung disease is severe, the number of CF patients cared for is not decreasing. Further, despite advances in therapeutics, it is unlikely that CF will disappear soon. Clearly, attention must be given to attracting trainees to pediatric pulmonology especially with major debt burden. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) leads to progressive decline in lung function with increased incidence of sleep hypoxemia in patients with severe lung disease. Sleep hypoxemia in CF patients has been proposed as an independent parameter in the evaluation of CF patients with significant burden of disease as there is no laboratory or clinical surrogate testing for sleep hypoxemia. However, there currently are no accepted guidelines for evaluating CF patients for sleep hypoxemia with a polysomnography (PSG).",

The tPAD has been evaluated in adults and is ideally suited for the delivery of medications to pediatric patients, in which aerosol delivery is particularly challenging. The primary objective of this study was to quantitatively determine the efficiency of pulmonary and body deposition of 7% hypertonic saline (HS) aerosol, labelled with saline 99m Tc-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), delivered via the tPAD to 3-8-year-old children with cystic fibrosis.

The mean age was 13\u00b1 2.3-years-old, mean BMI 18.1 kg/m 2 , mean FEV 1 74%, more frequent mutation F508del heterozygous, pancreatic insufficient pancreatic 87%. The CE test was performed using an electronically braked cycle ergometer which holds the power output constant independently of variations in cadence. The original Godfrey protocol with power output increments of 10 W in individuals with a height <120 cm, 15 W for those 120-150 cm and 20 W for those >150 cm tall was used. The exercise time was kept within the 8-12 min (1) . The MSWT was carried out in a standardized fashion using a CD player and two markers placed 9m apart. Patients had a paced 10-meter shuttle walk test by Singh, et al adapted and validated for use in CF. Subjects were allowed to run increasing the number of levels to 15 with a maximum speed of 10.2 km. All patients completed both tests on the same day, the second test was sequentially carried out after an interval of at least 30 minutes to return to resting level values. Parameters measured for evaluation of the tests were pulse oximeter, HR and dyspnea scores. Exercise time duration was recorded. Distance and peak work rate were measured. Values were expressed as mean and standard deviation. T-test and correlation analysis were used. Results: All patients were able to achieve maximum effort with both tests. There was no significant statistical difference between peak pulse rate (MSWT 187 \u00b1 10.1 ppm; CE 182 \u00b1 10.9 ppm, p= 0.110), and final pulse oximetry (MSWT 93 \u00b1 7%; CE 94 \u00b1 5 %, p= 0.479). The dyspnea score average was the same in both tests (7). There was a significant correlation analysis between distance (970 \u00b1 299 meters) and power (115 \u00b1 47.8 watts, R = 0.84) (p <0.01). Average time duration in MSWT was 11'32'' and in CE 8'43''. Conclusions: In our study, MSWT achieved similar peak HR response as CE and showed a strong correlation between power and distance. There was no statistical difference in final pulse oximetry. MSWT is simpler and less expensive than CE. The cost for each test was CE \u20ac3000; MSWT \u20ac500 respectively. The results of our study suggest that MSWT in lieu of CE should be considered for use in institutions with limited resources managing pediatric CF patients. MSWT provides a low-cost effective alternative for exercise tolerance evaluation with valid information for monitoring and prescription exercise in CF patients. Introduction: Exercise testing is an important tool in the evaluation and care of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). There is robust evidence that survival in CF is strongly correlated with exercise test results. Laboratory testing is not always freely available or feasible, resulting in field exercise tests often being performed in the clinical setting. The modified shuttle test (MST) is one field exercise test which has been shown to have a strong correlation with VO 2 peak and is responsive to inpatient treatment. There are currently no published normative data for the MST, either for healthy individuals or individuals with CF.",

The study enrolled 10 patients with CF or bronchiectasis between 6 -12 years of age who routinely performed PEP mask therapy on a daily basis at home. Each patient then performed two treatments (A and B) using the PEP mask in a randomized order. Treatment A was to perform PEP with a manual manometer as they would at home, while the digital manometer recorded the session without feedback to the patient. Simultaneously, a physical therapist trained in the use of PEP subjectively scored the patient's technique out of 10. Treatment B was to perform PEP using the digital manometer for feedback. The software then calculated quality of the treatment based on: achieving an inspiratory pressure of between 10 -20 cm H 2 O for at least 2 seconds, number of breaths taken and sets completed.",

To combine NEB and PEP allows a significant time savings in the daily care for patients without modifying lung delivery and it could improve treatment adherence. Introduction: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have impaired ability to clear thickened lower airway secretions, which often leads to progressive loss of lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and ultimately respiratory failure. Airway clearance treatment (ACT) aims to improve ventilation and mucociliary clearance through the removal of tenacious and obstructing secretions, however ACT often adds a significant treatment burden. High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is the most common method for ACT in the US CF population. The Aerobika\u00ae, an oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) device, approved by the FDA in May 2013, has become a common device within the US CF care community, despite the paucity of published literature. Many CF ACT studies comparing modalities have been published; however, few studies compare simultaneous use of 2 ACT modalities in an outpatient setting. The objectives of our pilot study are to: 1) provide preliminary evidence on the clinical efficacy of augmented ACT in CF patients by combining simultaneous use of the Aero-bika\u00ae and HFCWO, while providing preliminary data related to candidate primary outcomes that allows for future trials; 2) search for possible effects and associations; and 3) help inform decisions about larger clinical trials and patient inclusion criteria.",

Outcome metrics measured included rate of change of FEV 1 , cumulative days of additional antibiotics, and number of pulmonary exacerbations. Paired change in value from pre-to posttreatment was used in analysis for all variables. Linear regression was used and the slopes of the pre-and postinitiating Aerobika\u00ae data were compared against the null hypothesis. In addition we will calculate index of individuality.",

Conclusions: The addition of the OPEP device marginally reduced droplet size (paired t-test for each metric, p < 0.001), but the effect was small and likely unimportant, given that the finer droplets are more likely to penetrate further into the airways of the lungs, especially when restricted by secretions. The comparator BEN device produced similar, if slightly larger, droplet size results. Use of the AeroEclipse\u00ae-XL with tabletop compressor, either with or without the concurrent use of the Aerobika* OPEP device, would appear to be an effective method of delivering hypertonic saline to the lungs for the purpose of mucociliary clearance. Introduction: Many exercise programs use the six-minute walk test (6MWT) to assess change in endurance in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, it is unclear if the 6MWT truly captures maximum distance and speed for these patients, partially due to lack of external motivation apart from the test requirements of standardized verbal encouragement. In contrast, the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) provides external motivation to the test participant with the goal of reaching the 10 meter distance prior to the audible beep. The purpose of this retrospective chart review was to determine if the ISWT better captures endurance, as measured by distance and speed, in comparison to the 6MWT. The results of these two tests were compared both pre-and post-cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program.",

However, FEV 1 may not accurately predict a patient's exercise tolerance and great variability exists between patients with comparable lung function (Radtke T, et al.

Pediatrics, State Univ of NY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA; 3. Radiology, State Univ of NY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA Introduction: Pulmonary disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) (Erkkila J, et al. Clin Orthop Relat Res. 1978; 131:146-50) . Past studies in children with CF suggest the degree of thoracic kyphosis positively correlates with severity of pulmonary disease as measured by FEV 1 and FVC (Denton J, et al. Clin Orthop Relat Res. 981; . Bone disease is a common complication of adults with CF resulting in low bone density and increased risk of fracture. Consideration may be given to increased kyphosis as an added risk factor for compression fracture. Trunk deformity by elevated thoracic kyphosis may compromise vital capacity in other patient populations as well (Swisher A, et al. CF 101 Phys Therapist. 2010; 5,23) . If there is a positive correlation between thoracic kyphosis and severity of lung compromise, postural correction as a potential positive intervention may be warranted. Our primary aim was to analyze the correlation between thoracic kyphosis as measured by Cobb angle and FEV 1 and FVC as measurements of pulmonary disease.",

Despite prior studies in pediatric and adolescent CF populations concluding that kyphosis increased with severity of pulmonary compromise, this correlation was not found in our adult CF population. Failure of finding a correlation does not indicate that correcting postural dysfunction is without benefit. Unmeasured benefit such as decreased pain, improved functional status, limited progression of kyphosis or stabilization of lung function over time may exist.

Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital, Liverpool, United Kingdom Objectives: Given that the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) is the most frequently used marker of disease severity in CF, it fails to detect structural airway damage beyond conducting zones. Furthermore, there is growing concern that the FEV 1 lacks sensitivity during earlystage changes to the small airways (1) . Peak aerobic capacity (VO 2 peak) is largely affected by structural changes to the lung and is used to determine prognosis and assess lung transplantation eligibility (2) . Although there is evidence to suggest that VO 2 peak is a significant determinant of CF health-related quality of life (3), it has yet to be established as a surrogate marker of disease severity. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of VO 2 peak and FEV 1 on the number of days spent receiving intravenous antibiotics (IVA).",

Background: Lung transplant is a widely accepted treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) end-stage lung disease. The US lung allocation score (LAS) system prioritizes transplant candidates based on calculated risk of mortality. Despite their relative youth, CF candidates have the second highest rate of waitlist mortality. This suggests that the LAS may not accurately reflect the risk of waitlist mortality for CF candidates, and that the optimal timing of listing for lung transplant has not been established. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) includes variables from the time of wait-listing through the posttransplant period for all US transplant candidates and recipients. The CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) includes nearly 90% of the US CF population. The CFFPR includes disease-specific variables (ie, microbiology) not captured by the SRTR, and longitudinal information in the years before wait-listing.",

Future studies are planned to compare post-lung transplant survival between the two countries and determine the impact of pretransplant factors on posttransplant survival. Support: CFF. Rationale: A significant number of pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) die on the waitlist for transplant and the survival benefit of the procedure is controversial (Liou TG, et al., N Engl J Med. 2007; 357(21):2143-52) . Modification of the selection criteria for transplantation for pediatric patients with CF could improve both pre-and post-transplant mortality. Previous research has demonstrated that the Cystic Fibrosis Questionniare-Revised (CFQ-R) is able to predict pre-and post-transplant mortality in adults (Quittner AL, et al. Ped Pulmonol. 2005; Sol\u00e9 A, et al. J Heart Lung Transplant. 2016; 35:789-94) and posttransplant mortality in children (Bernstein R, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; 50(S41) :441). This study aimed to expand on previous research by evaluating the ability of the CFQ-R to predict waitlist mortality and to determine the ability of the parent-proxy version of the CFQ-R, given pretransplant, to predict pre-and post-transplant mortality, evaluated separately. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of the CFQ-R for both those waitlisted and transplanted was assessed.",

Our results demonstrate that the very advanced end-stage CF patients who are highly likely to die without transplant have comparable overall survival rates to more stable end-stage CF patients. In fact, the 65% five-year survival rate was identical in both groups and better than the median survival for all lung transplant recipients for non-CF diseases in the UNOS Registry. This suggests lung transplant is not only appropriate, but a judicious use of resources in carefully selected individuals with advanced lung failure due to cystic fibrosis at a high-volume, experienced lung transplant center. Furthermore, CFTR is expressed in ventricular myocytes and reduced CFTR activity could potentially predispose to LV dysfunction.",

Average degree of rapid decline is similar among the three phenotypes (roughly -3% predicted/year); however, average timing differs, with the mild, moderate and severe phenotypes experiencing rapid decline at 18.9, 16.1 and 12.9 years of age, respectively. Individuals with a mild phenotype of rapid decline have the highest initial FEV1% predicted but experience the greatest loss of lung function. Individuals with the severe phenotype of rapid decline are more likely to have infections (MRSA, Pa, and BC) at baseline or to develop them subsequently, compared to those with mild or moderate phenotypes of rapid decline (all P \u2264 0.001).",

Association between the two submodels arises through subject-specific random effects. The proposed joint model was contrasted with the traditional, separate model that analyzes the longitudinal and survival data separately. Each model was applied to clinical encounter data from the United States CF Foundation Patient Registry. Individuals 6-45 years of age with FEV 1 % clinical encounters were included. Data were included up to the time of the first PEx. Potential predictors included age, birth cohort, gender, first recorded FEV 1 %, socioeconomic status at baseline (SES); time-varying predictors were CF-related diabetes (CRFD), positive cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aerueus (MRSA), Burkholderia cepacia (BC) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). Computations were implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Results are reported as posterior means and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals. Model comparison and selection were based on the DIC criteria.",

Within the event submodel, being male and having lower initial FEV 1 % was associated with a lower risk of PEx, while people having lower SES was associated with a higher risk of PEx. The posterior estimates of the random intercept and slope coefficients, which measure the strength of association between the two submodels, are negative and significantly different from zero, providing strong evidence of association between the two submodels and indicating that both the initial level and slope of FEV 1 % was negatively associated with the hazard of an onset of PEx.

Newborns identified as carriers of one CF mutation, with a normal repeat IRT (<40ng/mL), are considered at low risk of having CF (<1%). Parents of these newborns receive telephone counseling on the clinical and reproductive risks by the CFNBS Nurse (CFNBSN). In addition, these families have the option to attend for a sweat test to exclude the possibility of CF if residual anxiety remains.

The English protocol is based on IRT-DNA-IRT, and those suspected of having CF are then referred to a CF centre for sweat testing. As new genetic mutations continue to be discovered we looked at outcomes of children with a normal sweat chloride (<30mmol/L) to ensure a diagnosis of CF had not been missed. We had previously presented results from 2 tertiary referral centres in the South East of England (Grime C, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2014; 49(S38) :385-6).

To our knowledge none of the remaining children have so far been re-referred with concerns regarding a possible diagnosis of CF in this extended study. However, a substantial proportion of these children without CF, who had positive CF newborn screens, were found to have significant health problems subsequently. The French newborn screening (NBS) program combines immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)-D3 /CF30 kit mutations if written informed consent (WIC) has been obtained/IRT-D21 safety net in case of no WIC, or no detected mutation plus ultrahigh IRT-D3. Infants with 1/2 mutations or no mutation and raised IRT-D21 were referred to the nearest CF center (CFC) for sweat testing (ST).",

The filled-out form was sent to the regional association and forwarded quarterly, after partial de-identification, to AFDPHE. A referent CF physician, with a data manager, was in charge of monitoring and collecting CF/CFSPID cases missed by NBS by a yearly questionnaire. All the practical aspects of the NBS program were discussed during a monthly board meeting and quarterly with the technical committee thus leading to changes in the algorithm (Munck A, et al. J Pediatr. 2008; 153:228-33) . The national database AFDPHE was linked to the French CF Registry.",

Objectives: A two-tiered strategy is widely used for population-based CF screening using an algorithm based on elevated IRT followed by a DNA mutation panel. Limitations of this strategy include a high rate of false positives and the identification of carriers with CFTR allele variants who do not express the disease. Herein, untargeted metabolite profiling of retrospective dried blood spot (DBS) cut-outs was performed in order to discover novel metabolic signatures in affected CF infants as a way to improve the positive predictive value of newborn screening (NBS) that is also amenable to low cost MS/MS analysis.",

A validation cohort is currently underway to evaluate the screening performance of lead metabolites for early detection of CF with improved specificity.",

Univ of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Introduction: Infants with CF screen positive inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID) or CFTR-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS) may turn out to have CF. Little is known about these individuals, including predictors of a later CF diagnosis. The role of laboratory testing, typically performed in patients with established CF, among children with CFSPID remains to be established. Based on a multicenter study (8 CF centres from Canada and Verona, Italy) that was established to prospectively evaluate children with CFSPID (Ooi CY, et al. Pediatrics. 2015; 135:e1377-85) , this study aimed to compare laboratory-test outcomes in subjects with CFSPID and CF.",

One-third of the mothers (7/21) endorsed elevated family psychosocial risk on the PAT. Compared to the normative sample, mothers reported engaging in less emotion-focused coping (expressing emotions, seeking social support) at diagnosis. Preliminary data analyses suggest a trend (p<.06) for mothers who engaged in problem-focused coping at higher rates than the mean to spend more hours using educational materials in the first month and report greater satisfaction with educational materials provided. These mothers preferred that educational materials focus on the first year of life significantly more than mothers who had lower than average rates of problem-focused coping (p<.05). For mothers who engaged in emotion-focused coping at greater rates than the mean, there was a trend for them to spend less time using educational materials in the first month (p<.06).

Fitting was restricted to individuals alive and uncensored at each landmark age, using predictors derived from available longitudinal measures of FEV1%. We began by using the \"usual\" level of FEV1% and its slope of change at the landmark age as predictors, obtained by fitting a linear mixed model to FEV1% measures in a period prior to the landmark age of interest. Four measures of FEV1% variability based on the interval up to the landmark age, were considered as additional predictors: (i) the standard deviation (SD) of FEV1% measures; (ii) the residual SD obtained from the mixed model; (iii) the range of FEV1%; (iv) the median deviation from the best FEV1% measure during the interval (following Morgan WJ, et al. J Pediatr. 2016; 169:116-21) . We show results from using a 5-year interval prior to each landmark age.

The initial sweat test was normal (<30mEq/L) in 83% and positive (>59mEq/L) in 5% of infants. Ten percent of infants had an intermediate test result (30-59mEq/L), and were initially categorized as \"possible CFTR-Related Metabolic Syndrome (CRMS)/CF\". An additional 2% had one or more CFTR mutations or variants on NBS (or prenatal genetics) of variable or unknown significance (VUS), with a sweat test < 60mEq/L, and were also categorized as \"possible CRMS/CF.\" By 6 months of age nearly 75% of infants with initial intermediate sweat testing had normal repeat sweat testing and were discharged from care. Two infants had positive repeat sweat tests and were confirmed to have CF at 10 weeks and 6 months of age respectively. Twenty-five infants were given a diagnosis of CRMS at 6 months of age based on persistent intermediate sweat tests and/or genetics of VUS. Two infants with an initial positive sweat test had repeat sweat testing (prompted by genetics of VUS), that was persistently intermediate and their diagnoses were changed to CRMS. Adherence to consensus guidelines for CRMS follow up has been variable; nearly 1/3 of infant famlies declined follow up, while those followed annually have a reassuring lack of symptoms reflective of inadequate CFTR function.",

Adherence to guidelines for CRMS care after 6 months of age is inconsistent and represents an area for quality improvement. Additional study is needed on the outcomes of these infants long term. . Background: Fecal elastase (FE) measurements have become routine and relied upon for evaluating pancreatic functional status. A low FE is consistent with pancreatic insufficiency (PI) and has been used in some newborn screening programs as part of the diagnostic processes. However, the CFF Diagnosis Consensus Committee questioned the value of FE, especially in follow-up after newborn screening.",

Introduction: The management of cystic fibrosis (CF) requires an ongoing monitoring of patients, in which many markers related to the evolution of the disease are collected. The analysis of these markers allows us to describe the progression of the disease and anticipate the occurrence of clinical events. In the case of cystic fibrosis, one of the most important markers is the FEV 1 which is used to assess the disease severity and to detect patients eligible for lung transplantation. Such markers dynamically change over time. It is then important to take into account all the repeated measures of FEV 1 rather than its value at baseline, to better assess the relationship between the marker and survival and to better predict the risk of event in patients with CF.",

Introduction: All newborn screening programs begin with measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) in dried blood spots taken early in life. However, universally a portion of CF cases are missed because they have levels of IRT below program cut points. Lowering cut points improves program sensitivity, but no reasonable cut point has been found for screening to be 100% sensitive. We sought to enroll all U.S. programs into a survey to determine (a) the prevalence of CF cases missed due to IRT levels below program cutoffs, and (b) characteristics of the newborn population, screening programs, hospitals, laboratories, and specimen transit associated with risk of being missed by CF newborn screening because of a low IRT value.",

Introduction: In Germany, the Federal Joint Committee decided to implement a nationwide CF newborn screening in 2016. Evidence from recent European studies suggests that protocols using immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) for cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening (NBS) may be successfully used as a purely biochemical NBS strategy. Pure IRT/PAP protocols can reach acceptable sensitivities and specificities, but this comes at the expense of a relatively low positive predictive value (PPV). The Dutch CHOPIN study (Vernooij-van Langen AMM, et al. Thorax. 2012; 67:289-95) has reported that using a three-tier strategy (IRT/PAP + extended gene analysis) results in a better PPV. The German authorities decided also for an IRT/PAP/DNA protocol, but due to the strict German gene diagnostic act, extended gene analysis was not desirable as 3rd tier.",

Pediatrics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA Lung disease continues to be a dominating feature of CF, contributing significantly to its morbidity and mortality. CF newborn screening (CFNBS) provides an opportunity for early disease identification and intervention to avert the progression of lung disease. In California, CFNBS started in July of 2007. The screening algorithm implemented can detect previously known as well as novel mutations and variants of unknown significance, with corresponding varying degrees of CFTR dysfunction. This presents a diagnostic dilemma, as many will remain asymptomatic in early childhood, a condition categorized as CFTR-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS). Only through the systematic and detailed longitudinal study of infants with CRMS can an understanding of the associated risk for lung disease be better established. We hypothesized that biomarkers reflective of the inflammatory activity from lung disease will differ between CF and CRMS infants. We evaluated a panel of inflammatory biomarkers in a cohort of infants identified through CFNBS. Plasma samples were obtained as part of a longitudinal prospective study during a period of good health and freedom from exacerbation. A human cytokine Luminex 63-plex antibody bead kit (custom-built by eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) was used according to manufacturer's recommendations. Of particular interest inflammatory cytokines typically reported in CF lung disease such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 were not significantly different between the groups and found at low levels, perhaps as a reflection of their stable health and early stage in the disease process. However, we did notice differences in cytokines associated with immune modulation, response to infection and innate immunity. Statistically significant differences were noted between infants with CF and those with CRMS (boxplots for distribution by study group in Figure, all comparisons p<0.05), with CF infants demonstrating increased levels (in pg/mL) of the proinflammatory cytokines MIG, TNF\u03b1, VEGF, Resistin, and MIP1\u03b2, and lower levels of the immunemodulatory IL-22. We conclude that systemic inflammatory profiling in CF NBS infants demonstrates significant differences, with a benign profile for infants with CRMS suggesting a lack of significant lung disease early in life in this group. is an ongoing observational study that tracks longitudinal demographic, clinical and treatment outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) receiving care at CF care centers in the United States. The CFFPR captures patient death dates along with six options to specify primary cause of death. However, not all people with CF participate in the CFFPR and not all deaths of people with CF are recorded in the registry. Therefore, the true number of deaths caused by CF each year remains unknown.",

Both the pediatric and adult teams have been excited about the results of the program with better patients' knowledge and independence. Finding creative ways to remind and help patients participate in this program has been well received by patients and has been rewarding for the medical team. Capitalizing on using clinic and inpatient time to get patients to participate has been helpful. Our next steps are to incorporate some direct quotes from this age range to share with the whole center, hoping to encourage participation from patients who may be less motivated. Aims: To validate PortCF ICFs at our site, assess our current PortCF informed consent/enrollment process, and identify quality issues/barriers to compliance.",

All ICFs for active patients (n=189) were uploaded into PortCF. All original ICFs were refiled alphabetically. Next, methods for obtaining, recording, and filing ICFs were reviewed. Previously the consent process was completed by clinicians and research staff and a list was kept of enrollments only, including ICF date.

We improved our processes for consistency and efficiency, and to prevent future errors from occurring. In our new process, ICF is only obtained only by a research team member. This includes the CF Registry Coordinator (CFRC) who is a research coordinator, the lead Research Coordinator, or the Research Manager. Once the ICF is signed, the CFRC then a) updates a tracking spreadsheet; b) sends a copy of ICF to medical records; c) scans ICF for electronic archiving; d) files original ICF alphabetically; e) enrolls patient in PortCF; f) uploads ICF into PortCF. New lists have been created to track patients who declined consent or are not enrolled and those who have not been approached for initial consent or require re-consent due to age.

Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA Introduction: Tremendous advances in CF care have resulted in a vast improvement in the health, lifespan, and quality of life of individuals with CF. Unfortunately, optimal medical care is time consuming and complex and involves medications and treatments administration through multiple modalities through the day. Maintaining the daily medication regimen is difficult for many people with CF and their families. Previous research has demonstrated that rates of medical regimen adherence for people with CF are around 50%. Patients and families cite a number of barriers to adherence including educational deficiencies, family stressors, scheduling difficulties, and defiance.

The KA revealed a linear relationship between BMI and CF nutrition knowledge. Patient comments identified nutritional barriers of time and cost of food and/or supplements. The MA was notable for inconsistent provider nutrition recommendations, including use of oral supplements and discussion of feeding tubes. Based on these findings we designed a multi-faceted 4-stage CF nutritional algorithm that incorporates patient education and standardizes nutrition interventions based on severity of malnutrition. For each patient the CF dietitian tracks education received, nutrition goals, interventions recommended, and stage on the algorithm. Nutrition status of each patient is discussed in the pre-clinic multidisciplinary meeting, and we incorporate nutritional information, algorithm interventions, and goals for the next appointment into the CF clinic note template.

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity in patients with CF. As survival increases, the incidence of CFRD will likely correspondingly increase. It is associated with added mortality; however several small studies have demonstrated improvement in lung function and BMI with insulin therapy. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the standard of care for screening, however it is associated with a historically low rate of patient compliance. Emerging literature has suggested that detection and treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia, diagnosed by a 1-hour glucose challenge test (GCT), may be beneficial, however overall research is limited.",

Pediatric Pulmonology, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Cleveland, OH, USA Introduction: Airway infection remains an important contributor to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Antibiotic therapy has contributed significantly to increased survival in CF. However, CF patients generally require higher dosing than those without CF because of differences in organism minimum inhibitory concentration, antibiotic airway penetration, and altered medication pharmacokinetics secondary to their CF. This can make dosing of antibiotics difficult and time consuming. We created the CF antibiotic dosing calculator (CFADC) with the goal of making dosing faster and easier for this patient population.",

The calculator contains four pages for IV and oral dosing for adults and children respectively. For children, the calculator functions by inputting their weight. It then calculates a recommended dose and a dosing range based on published recommendations for CF antibiotic dosing. Maximum dosing is capped at the maximum daily dose and the maximum weight that can be entered is capped at 50kg. For ease of oral dosing the CFADC additionally recommends rounded doses for both tablet and oral solution within the calculated dosing range. For IV dosing the calculator rounds the dose to the nearest vial size to minimize wasted medication. The CFADC was put in use for 6 months then an anonymous survey was given to the pulmonary physicians and CF center staff. The providers were asked to estimate the time it took them to dose the antibiotics with and without the calculator. They were also asked to rank the ease of deciding a dose and their confidence in that dose on a scale of one to ten, with ten representing the easiest and most confident, with and without the calculator. Responses were collected and analyzed using a two-tailed t-test.",

In order to better serve patients with cystic fibrosis, the pediatric center at Children's Health distributed a clinic-specific patient satisfaction survey from March to May of 2015. Results of this survey were analyzed and an area that was suboptimal was the ability to easily schedule quarterly appointments. The CF Foundation's (CFF) clinical care guidelines recommend that people ages 6 and older visit their care centers at least four times a year.

In the 1st quarter of 2015 the Children's Health score for patient satisfaction regarding obtaining appointments was reported at 66% and by the 4th quarter of 2015 satisfaction increased to 100%. Patient satisfaction increased due to appointments being made prior to clinic discharge and because schedulers were proactively calling families. In situations where appointments were not promptly scheduled, patient satisfaction still improved because families were given explanation and assurance for a quick resolution. Reasons for delay were often unopened physician templates or attempts to coordinate care between providers from different disciplines.",

Moving forward, monthly monitoring of unscheduled appointments will be completed to decrease the number of patients who are not seen on a quarterly basis. Currently all 50 states screen for cystic fibrosis on the newborn screen. In Texas, CF screening was added to the panel in 2009. High levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) protein in the blood may be a marker of cystic fibrosis. Texas uses an IRT/DNA algorithm, with initial screening using IRT and second screening, if required, screening for 40 common mutations. In some cases, understanding the possible outcome on a newborn screen and when to obtain a sweat chloride test on a newborn can be challenging. This confusion can lead to delayed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and delay initiation of treatment. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation awarded the pediatric center at the University of Texas-Southwestern Medical Center/ Children's Health a screening improvement program (SIP) grant in order to optimize the diagnosis and early treatment of newborns. This quality improvement project involves educating pediatricians, family medicine practices and NICUs in our catchment area to enhance their understanding of CF, newborn screening, and when to refer patients for sweat testing and for disease-specific care.",

Pediatric Pulmonary, Children's of Alabama/ University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA Inpatients with cystic fibrosis (CF) at the Children's of Alabama/University of Alabama at Birmingham (COA/UAB) pediatric CF center are cared for either by a medical resident or nurse practitioner (NP) team, both led by an attending physician. The outpatient CF team identified issues with continuity of care when caregivers or pharmacists called the CF center after discharge with problems such as lack of prior authorizations (PAs), unwritten prescriptions, lack of knowledge of where to get medications or prescriptions sent to the incorrect pharmacy. These issues caused delays as long as 2 weeks in reception of discharge medications. Therefore the inpatient and outpatient CF teams along with the Title V program, Children's Rehabilitation Service (CRS) which provides insurance supplementation for qualified patients developed a plan to improve discharge planning for medication prescriptions.",

They overwhelmingly agreed that they knew the home plan. About half of them reported that they were asked to recite the plan before discharge. Although very few reported difficulty receiving discharge medications, the outpatient nursing phone notes were used to measure delays. In January 2015 when the discharge planning meeting occurred, 48% of patient records revealed delays in discharge medications. Following the face-to-face meeting and implementation of the shared discharge document, delays were rapidly decreased to 28% in only 1 month and currently are at an average of 10% with some months without recorded delays.",

Most importantly, delays in discharge medications have greatly decreased. This is particularly impressive given rapid changes in policies of 3rd party payors and specialty pharmacies. In 2015, COA/UAB pediatric CF program established the practice of discharge goals set by the primary pulmonologist. It was recognized by program leadership that increased isolation of the inpatient team from the outpatient team due to the physical expansion of our facility may have resulted in patients being discharged prior to meeting specific nutritional or respiratory health goals that were expected by the primary pulmonologist. Discharge goals were instituted to improve communication and define patient-specific goals to determine resolution of pulmonary exacerbation (PE) or nutritional endpoints set by the primary pulmonologist.",

Although the improvement in average FEV1% from admission to discharge was lower in 2015 compared to 2014, the decrease in FEV1 at follow-up was less as was the number of unique patients requiring admission. Discharge goals are now a standard of care and we have a goal to increase jointly established FEV1% goals from 37% of the population to all patients able to reliably perform pulmonary function testing. Background: Our patient and staff satisfaction surveys showed that our patients felt they were waiting too long in clinic during quarterly visits and our staff viewed clinic as a very stressful place to work. Upon closer review of cycle time, we noted that our average cycle time was 125 minutes, but contact time with providers was only 61%, giving the patients the impression that there was a lot of wasted time. Our aim was to improve our patients' knowledge of and adherence to prescribed pulmonary therapies.

Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA Introduction: Life expectancy has been increasing for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and there are now more adults than children with the disease. A formal transition program for transfer of care from the pediatric CF center to the adult CF center did not previously exist at our center. This created obstacles such as patient and family anxiety and apprehension in transferring of care, missed or delayed appointments at the new center and lack of adequate communication among healthcare providers. The newly developed transition program aimed at: 1) Sharing responsibility between the pediatric and adult CF teams to secure a smooth transition of care; and 2) Improving preparedness for transition of patients with CF and their families with positive impact on patients' outcomes.",

A series of parallel interventions were planned and implemented by our improvement team which included a hospital vice president, project manager, resident and attending physicians, nurses, therapists, dieticians, social workers, child life, and parents. To improve communication, interdisciplinary rounds were initiated five days per week, personalized schedule boards were updated during rounds, and daily afternoon huddles with the team were introduced. To improve the patient experience our CF Family Advisory Board created an informational brochure discussing what to expect during the hospitalization, and our dieticians developed a high-calorie CF menu. To increase adherence a reward program was offered to the patients. Using our electronic medical record (EPIC) a clinical scorecard was established to track outcomes. FEV1 % increase and % weight gain were tracked as measures of clinical improvement. To improve RT services, a needs assessment was completed comparing the total number of pediatric inhaled therapies with current RT staffing. To improve PT services, a CF Bootcamp with expanded exercise options was established and FitBits were given to patients ages 10 and above to monitor exercise. Data were tracked using EPIC, RedCAP software, and pediatric HCAHPS family surveys after discharge.",

Interdisciplinary rounds were successfully completed 5 days per week an average of 98% of the time. In the HCAHPS surveys, 92% of patients rated the hospital experience highly (national HCAHPS average is 79%). FEV1 during admission increased by an average of 8% (goal 15%), and the amount of weight gain during admission for patients below the 50th percentile was 4% (goal 3%). Since the start of the adherence program in June 2015 satisfaction data showed that 85% of 7 families who completed surveys felt their child was more compliant, and 90% of the 26 nurses surveyed felt patients were more adherent with fewer barriers to care. We successfully demonstrated the need for a full time RT on the pediatric unit and the position was approved. Fitbits were distributed to 21 patients as part of the CF Bootcamp program.",

Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA Background: Clinical practice in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) is shifting with the evolution of CFTR modulators. Kalydeco (ivacaftor), the first approved medication of this class, has shown persistent benefits in lung function and other disease markers with concurrent rapid adoption by the CF community. Recent approval of Orkambi (lumacaftor/ ivacaftor) has expanded availability to patients with the most common mutation in CFTR, but safe medication use is challenging to navigate with concern for associated adverse effects.",

One measure of improved core strength (V-sit) reached statistical significance, but others (superman and plank) did not. Limitations include variable time between visits and small sample size. Patient nonadherence to exercise recommendations is another potential limitation, but has not been assessed. Time variability between visits is primarily related to system and scheduling issues. Future focus of the program includes assessing adherence to exercise recommendations, reducing and standardizing time between visits to decrease variability, and increasing sample size to determine if these or other improvements in fitness are sustained over time.

A process map for transition was established and a OneCF Center transition policy was developed. Fifty patients age \u226519 years old followed by the pediatric team were identified as the initial transition cohort. A letter was sent to families communicating the goals of the transition program, CF patients were assigned a \"transition coordinator\" from within our teams, and existing transition tools including CF RISE were implemented. A quarterly transition meeting involving both the pediatric and adult teams was initiated to systematically discuss transition cohort patients, identify potential obstacles for transition, and to establish a mutually agreed upon plan and time frame for transfer.",

Pediatrics, Univ of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; 2. Univ of Connecticut, Farmington, CT, USA; 3. Pediatrics, West Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV, USA; 4. Utah Dept of Health, Salt Lake City, UT, USA Introduction: Notification of a positive newborn screen (NBS) results in tremendous anxiety and uncertainty in parents from their first contact from the NBS program until resolution of the screen. Much of this anxiety is related to the fear of the unknown and an unrealistic expectation as to risks that their child might have CF. Most NBS programs mandate genetic counseling, but this service can be quite variable depending on the Center. Genetic counseling is frequently not provided by genetic counselors (GCs) due to funding constraints or availability of a genetic counselor within the CF treatment centers. A GC is not a routine part of most pulmonary clinics, and as such, must be brought in from another program. In smaller or more rural centers, access to a GC might not be possible. The use of telemedicine has allowed access to genetic counseling services in many regions that would not otherwise have had access to these services either geographically or financially. There are two major issues that are significant to the provision of better GC services to families who are identified through the CF NBS program: reducing inappropriate anxiety by ensuring that families have appropriate information about the screen, the risks of CF, and the process that will be involved in coming to diagnostic resolution about their child, and ensuring that families have a better understanding of the genetic implications of having a child identified as being a carrier for CF, the possibility of having a future child who has CF, and the screening of other family members that is appropriate given the specific structure of the family and the specific mutations identified.",

Optimal pain management for patients with CF has not yet been studied. However, several disadvantages to opioid medications exist including tolerance, possible overdose, and potential for abuse.

Background: Low vitamin D stores are common in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients due to decreased absorption and insufficient intake. At our CF center, serum vitamin D is routinely checked as part of annual labs. Since 2010, a quality improvement (QI) goal for our center has been to improve patients' vitamin D stores, but we did not have a supplementation protocol to correct low levels. In 2011, 76% of our patients had at least one vitamin D level obtained as part of their annual labs. Since our QI initiative began, levels obtained increased to 96% in 2015. We used the 2012 evidence-based guidelines on the management of vitamin D recommended by CF Foundation as our supplementation protocol. Using this protocol we monitored and supplemented vitamin D in our patients with low levels. After implementation, in 2013, 55% of our patients had sufficient vitamin D levels.",

From 2013-2015, patients with sufficient serum vitamin D increased from 55% to 71%, respectively, suggesting our current protocol is meeting vitamin D requirements in the majority of our patients. This prompted us to examine the supplemental vitamin D dose in our patient population. We found that patients maintained sufficient serum levels when supplemented with an average of 2812 IU vitamin D in addition to any CF-specific vitamins or multivitamins. Adherence, vitamin D formulation and degree of malabsorption may explain the wide range in supplemental vitamin D dose required (800 IU-10,000 IU daily). Our goals for 2016 are to further educate patients on the importance of vitamin D and thus improve adherence to the recommended regimen. Finally, utilizing these results we plan to further investigate and implement a standard maintenance dosing protocol of approximately 3000 IU daily in all of our patients.",

Parad, R.; Murphy, K.; Langner, E. Newborn Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Background: NBS, the process of testing blood collected on filter paper after birth and identifying babies at risk for life-threatening disorders, is a complex public health process that has been in place in the U.S. for over 50 years. To be effective, collection and transport of the sample, lab testing, and result reporting must be timely, as diagnostic and treatment delays impact neonatal outcome. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) recommends that NBS results for time-critical disorders should be reported by the 5th day of life. For this to be accomplished, NBS must be collected and transported to the newborn screening lab -a multistep intrahospital process also known as the \"pre-analytic\" phase of NBS -when a newborn is 24-48 hours of age.",

We will measure the effectiveness of the toolkit by comparing metrics pre-and postdissemination. Minimizing pre-analytic time metrics for sample collection and transport of NBS samples can be accomplished by our proposed process, potentially cutting days off the time from birth to result reporting, and minimizing delays in diagnosis and treatment of CF and other life-threatening disorders.",

However, several adults/caregivers preferred $25, citing existing time burdens, value of their input, and other organizations' compensation standards. For long or complex studies, most respondents (88% adults/ caregivers and 90% RTMs) agreed that additional pay should be considered but were divided between a completion bonus (40% adults/caregivers and 58.8% RTMs) or escalating pay structure (34% adults/caregivers and 12% RTMs). Comments noted that escalating pay might be more effective without penalizing participants who withdraw from a study due to unforeseen illness. Over 70% of respondents agreed participants should be reimbursed for mileage, parking, and meals -even if visits coincide with a clinic visit. 50% to 92% of respondents agreed that a $30/hour rate was appropriate for research consultants -including serving on a patient and family advisory board -regardless of whether the consultant was a person with CF, caregiver, or RTM. Throughout the survey, comments emphasized the time and financial burden of CF generally and study participation specifically.

Line-specific information included line type, lumen size, number of lumens, and use of anticoagulation. Vascular complications were defined as line occlusion or venous thrombosis. Infectious complications included blood stream infections and local cellulitis. A survey was administered to attending physicians at each site to assess practice variation. PICC complications were modeled using multilevel logistic regression with line nested within patient.

The overall rate of complications with TIVADs was lower than for PICCs: 0.25 events/TCD and 0.20 events/TCD for vascular and infectious complications, respectively. The median survival of TIVADs was 514 days and did not vary significantly by center, (p=0.85). Interestingly, we observed a range in the overall PICC complication rate per TCD across centers varying from 1.96 to 12.96. We found the probability of a line complication in a treated patient varied across centers (0.026 to 0.141, p=0.001).

Responses were ranked on a Likert scale: I always do this (4), I am learning to do this (3), I don't know how to do this, but I want to learn (2) , I don't know how to do this (1), I don't need to do this (0). The worksheet was administered June-August 2015 to patients ages 14-25. A median [interquartile range] score for each skill was compared between patients in pediatric vs adult care.

Ped., Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA, USA Background: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) recommends use of oral vitamin D3 (D3) for all individuals with CF to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) \u2265 30 ng/mL. Although daily or weekly dosing is suggested, specific doses are only given for daily and are based on 3 age groups (< 1 year; 1 to 10 years, and > 10 years). This age-based dosing for the pediatric population may not be as effective as a weightbased dosing, as a child may triple their weight between 1 and 10 years, or between 10 years and adulthood. Also, a weekly dose could result in increased compliance and reduced pill burden. Therefore, based on the effectiveness of a weekly dose of 50,000 IU of D3 in adults (Khazai NB, et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2009; 94:2037-43) we calculated a weekly dose protocol for pediatric patients based on weight.",

Intermountain Primary Children's, Salt Lake City, UT, USA Background: Intermountain Specialty Pharmacy (ISP) works in conjunction with Intermountain Cystic Fibrosis Pediatric Center to streamline the counseling and delivery process for patients to improve adherence. Barriers to medication adherence for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients include cost, access, and poly-pharmacy. The primary purpose of this study was to compare medication possession ratios (MPR) pre-and post-implementation of an integrated pharmacy team designated to CF starting on January 1, 2016. The second purpose was to compare hospitalization rates and MPR between ISP and non-ISP pharmacies for 2015. Dornase alfa was evaluated due to its evidence of increasing lung function in patients (Flume P, et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2007; 176:957-69) .",

A generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis calculated a statistically significant difference in adherence for ISP vs. non-ISP patients (p<0.001). A total of 49 patients in 2015 were identified as having at least one dornase alfa claim in 2015 and 2016; this represents roughly one-fifth of the CF center's population. Of these 49 patients, 16 patients filled at ISP and 33 patients did not fill with ISP. Of the 16 total ISP patients, 6 were hospitalized during 2015 in comparison to 20 out of the 33 non-ISP patients. The average MPR in 2015 for ISP patients hospitalized was 91% versus 97% for patients not hospitalized. For non-ISP patients, the average MPR was 66% and 81%, respectively. A Spearman's rho test calculated the correlation between average MPR and hospitalizations for ISP patient to be -0.341 (p=0.052).",

Although the correlation between MPR and hospitalization with ISP patients was not statistically significant, a trend was noted.

Pediatric Pulmonology, Greenville Health System, Greenville, SC, USA Background: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation guidelines recommend quarterly CF clinic visits for ongoing multidisciplinary evaluations, close surveillance, and early interventions in exacerbations and other complications. Our center serves the upstate of SC, and portions of NC and GA. We believe distance to our center, cost of gas, appointment availability, no shows, excessive appointment duration, communication barriers, and low socioeconomic status have contributed to a decline in quarterly visits noted in previous years. This also adversely affected collection of annual labs, PFTs, and surveillance cultures. This trend was an identified area for improvement as part of our ongoing center QI assessment, and in review of center-specific registry data, specifically in patients aged 7-17 years. We believe this was one factor in inhibiting our ability to deliver timely and high quality CF care.",

This had been occurring regularly, but an increased emphasis was placed on this and a more systematic review process was put in place at our regular CF team meetings. A punch card was also used to track visits and included review with patients and families. Our social worker and clerical staff worked closely to schedule and reschedule patients that were not meeting their quarterly visit goals. Case management of high risk families began to occur at a much higher rate as appointment compliance became a part of our team meeting discussions.

Conclusion: A QI project focused on improving regular visit compliance that included a financial incentive was very effective in improved center-specific registry outcomes. In reflecting, CF team behaviors and discussions changed markedly during this QI project in a way we believe was highly impactful, likely more so, in addition to the offered financial incentive. We also anticipate this will be a positive and sustained cultural change within our center. Other unanticipated effects included increased budgeted hours for SW and a more regular and structured weekly CF team meeting.

National Jewish Health -Saint Joseph Hospital, Denver, CO, USA Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) receive many antibiotics throughout their lifetime to treat pulmonary infections. Over time, they can develop allergies to antibiotics that may be considered optimal for effective treatment. Patients with history of type-I hypersensitivity reaction to an antibiotic can be desensitized to that drug if clinically necessary. Desensitization induces a temporary immune-tolerant state, allowing for safe administration of the allergenic medication until scheduled doses are stopped. It is accomplished by administering increasing doses until the therapeutic dose is reached and tolerated. Due to risk for allergic reaction during this process, 1:1 nursing care is necessary. However, severe reactions are rare (Legere H, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2009; 8(6),418-24) . CF patients are traditionally transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for this procedure and once completed, move back to the pulmonary unit (PU). This process was noted to cause delays in patient care, decreased patient and staff satisfaction, increased risk for handoff errors, and misuse of ICU resources.",

As more programs deploy the survey and track results, there are a number of strategies to improve experience of care promoted by national patient experience institutions: cultivating respectful partnerships; establishing infrastructure to support and engage all stakeholders; encouraging all stakeholders-patients, providers, institutional leaders-to review results; leveraging social media and networks to build a culture of improvement and participation; and benchmarking with programs exceling at experience of care. People with CF and their family members bring their own point-of-view and expertise to a clinical encounter and they also provide valuable reflections and insights into their working relationship with the healthcare team, fresh eyes to the process of care delivery, and knowledge about managing their disease. Measuring patient and family experience of care can reveal which care processes at a CF clinic are working well and which can be improved. In January 2015 all accredited CF care centers (276 pediatric, adult and affiliate programs) were invited to participate in the national deployment of the CF patient and family experience of care survey. The survey is designed as a continuous data collection to enable programs to measure and monitor the experience of care over time and compare their results with other CF programs. A feedback system was implemented to enable teams to review results, plan future improvement work, and evaluate the impact of their work.",

Additionally, comments to open-ended questions can be reviewed. Between January 2015 and July 2015, 45 programs collected 820 pediatric (parent or caregiver of child with CF) and 529 adult (people with CF 18 years and older) questionnaires, which created a benchmark cohort. A 50th percentile comparative value was calculated for each survey question and variance component analysis established a program standard deviation used for program comparison.

Brigham and Women's Hosp., Boston, MA, USA Introduction: Once-daily tobramycin (ODT) is often used for acute pulmonary exacerbations (APEs) from gram-negative organisms in CF. Due to ODT's narrow therapeutic index, our institutional practice is to monitor peak and trough serum concentrations as markers of efficacy and toxicity. Data suggest current target serum trough concentrations may be excessive and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) monitoring may be more predictive of ODT exposure (Begg E, et al. Br J Clin Pharmac. 1995; 36:605-9) . Further data found that AUC values are frequently elevated despite trough levels of <1mg/mL (Coulthard K, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2007; 6:125-30) . We initiated a quality improvement pilot to evaluate the precision of these reported values vs. calculated pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of 1-hour (hr) peak and 24-hr AUC to assess the accuracy of ODT monitoring in CF at our institution.",

Study coordination is a multifaceted job vital to the clinical research industry, yet across institutions there is a lack of standardized education and training to prepare these invaluable study team members for their role. There have been successful efforts to close this gap between adequate preparation and disproportionate expectations of RCs. The Johns Hopkins (JH) Study Coordinator Apprenticeship and Mentoring Program is a hallmark of this work towards standardizing RC education and training.

A successful transition requires patients to learn skills necessary for self-management, self-advocacy, and health care decision making. A way these skills are typically assessed is through a transition-readiness assessment (TRA) and at our CF center one of the biggest disparities was the knowledge of cleaning and sterilizing airway clearance equipment (CSACE). A quality improvement (QI) approach was utilized to focus on this self-management skill to gradually develop appropriate goals between the respiratory therapist (RT), patients, and their caregivers as a collaborative team.",

Assessment checklists were created as a method to continually evaluate the knowledge of the techniques used in the household to properly CSAC equipment. A handout with the proper cleaning and sterilizing steps was produced for the families as an easy reference to use at home for further practice. A demonstration video was recorded by a patient at our CF center as a way to illustrate to the other age-appropriate patients that they too have the ability to learn this self-management skill. After a successful trial with 2 eligible patients the following process was implemented: Visit 1) baseline survey, assessment, and education; Visit 2) re-assessment, re-education, and demonstration video; Visit 3) re-assessment, re-education, and patient's own demonstration video reviewed by the RT for inaccuracies; and Visit 4) an annual re-assessment.",

Further improvement may be attained with an increase in availability of sweat chloride test/provider appointments. Currently, our on-call physicians staff all of these patients.

We previously evaluated health outcomes related to incidence of depression and hypothesized that rate of decline of health outcomes since our screening initiation would be worse in depressed individuals. We evaluated the effect of depression on patient health outcomes including FEV 1 % predicted, BMI, 25-OH D levels and hospitalizations.",

Methods and Interventions: Beginning in 2012, the Adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Team began a quality improvement project that focused on standardizing the delivery of inpatient care. First, the outpatient CF Team worked with inpatient colleagues to implement standardized care. For nutrition, the adult ideal body weight equation was adjusted to include a disease-severity factor. For airway clearance therapy (ACT) CF center respiratory therapists (RTs) provided re-training to all hospital RTs for ACT modalities and inhaled medications (this recently included IPV). For pulmonary exacerbations, the inpatient ACT goal became 6 h/day. Hospital implementation of EPIC electronic medical record (EMR) allowed for a standard order set. CF-specific teaching was provided to hospitalists. Then, in 2015 admissions were centralized to a specific respiratory-focused floor. The CF Team provided education to nurses, staff, pharmacy, physical therapy, and diabetic educators assigned to this floor. Finally, infection control practices were reviewed and standardized.",

After the 2015 implementation of patient admissions to a single floor, LOS decreased to 6.3 days. Subsequently, this LOS has been consistent in 2016 (6.0 days). PortCF data from 2014 show that antibiotic duration has not changed (13.5 d). Because the current literature lacks additional metrics to determine the effectiveness of a hospitalization, this proposal will evaluate change in CRP levels during hospitalization, change in lung function (e.g., FEV1 returns within 90% of baseline) during hospitalization, and improved lung function after hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbations. For admissions to treat distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), time until next episode of DIOS will be evaluated. Overall, PortCF data show continued improvement in lung function and BMI for adult patients. Anecdotally, patients commented that continuity of case-management and social work services have improved after admissions were centralized to a specific floor.",

National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, USA Introduction: An accurate prediction model, called a nomogram, would be valuable in clinical care and research trial design to predict survival of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Although several models have been developed to predict survival of CF patients, none allow the physician to graphically demonstrate the probability of a patient's outcome during an appointment. The motivation for these nomograms is their ability to allow for graphical presentation of a prediction model that integrates patient measurements, labeled predictors. Each predictor is modeled by a scale, with each possible value/category of that predictor corresponding to a specific number of points based on the prognostic significance of the value/category. The model is represented graphically with the scales of the predictors and how they combine to calculate the continuous probability of a particular outcome illustrated. This enables physicians or researchers to make educated, accurate patient-specific determinations of prognosis and therapy decisions and allows them to communicate the prognosis to the patient in an effective manner.",

The age of patients was defined as either age at last appointment for patients who were alive at the time of this study, or age at death. Patients alive at the time of the study were considered to have censored survival times. An indicator variable, Death Status, was used to differentiate between censored survival times and ages of death. Based on previous survival models of CF patients, the following predictors were included: gender, BMI, race, baseline FEV 1 , cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) status, Pseudomonas aeruginosa status, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) status, length of diagnosis in years, number of hospitalizations since diagnosis, and Burkholderia cepacia status.

The current Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) recommendations for children diagnosed with CF prior to age 2 years are to strive for weight-for-length >50 th percentile based on CDC growth curves (Stallings VA, et al. J Am Diet Assoc. 2008; 108:832-9) . These recommendations have not been applied using the WHO growth curves, which are now standard for measurement of children <2 years in the United States.",

This may be attributable to the small sample size. The increase in hospital admissions and clinic visits in group 1 may be related to an increase in early illness recognition. The CHIP results have allowed the CF team to focus on the importance of parental self-care as this is often neglected. Failure to enroll group 2 patients for HV has caused the CF team to consider a different intervention for this group which is in its early stages of development. Introduction: Underweight individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) commonly have one or more barriers contributing to their low weight. These factors fall into several categories and include both medical and non-medical issues. Correctly identifying these specific barriers is essential to finding the most appropriate interventions to promote weight gain. Body mass index (BMI) is often used as a marker of nutritional status. Optimal BMI for CF patients is >22 kg/m 2 for females, >23 kg/m 2 for males. In the context of a CQI initiative to improve nutritional status, we surveyed our patients to identify barriers to optimal nutrition.",

Focusing on specific problems associated with low BMI status may be the best way to promote weight gain and overall nutritional improvement within this group. Notably this risk identification may also help to identify patients who are at risk for weight loss based on their comorbid diagnoses, symptomology, financial status or reported barriers to eating. As a next step of the CQI initiative, a one-page information sheet outlining financial resources available to CF patients was developed as financial hardship was identified as one of the most prevalent barriers to optimal nutrition. CF team members will distribute the one-page information sheet and review financial resources with patients with BMI <21 in clinic during 2016. Objective: Kids with cystic fibrosis (CF) have problems maintaining a healthy weight related to their disease status, which could increase parental stress and negatively sway perceptions of mealtime behaviors. Evidence-based and CF-specific treatments have been shown to reduce parents' perception of mealtime problems, but these involve a high degree of family burden (eg, travel, extra clinic visits) and clinics (eg, staff time commitments). Our purpose was to pilot a new intervention addressing parenting stress and parents' negative mealtime perceptions using video-based telemedicine to reduce trips to the clinic and an individualized problemfocused curriculum to promote efficiency.",

Adults with CF who had undergone lung transplantation (n = 4) or who were known to have cirrhotic liver disease (n = 1) or had weekly dosing of vitamin D 3 below 50,000 IU (n = 10) or had weekly dosing of over 50,000 IU (n = 3) or who did not have repeat vitamin D testing (n = 7) were excluded. This study was approved by the University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board. Through consultation with the endocrinologist, our clinic vitamin D repletion protocol for treating CF adult patients who have serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) < 75 nmol/L (< 30 ng/mL) was to prescribe vitamin D 3 10,000 IU orally from Monday to Friday (or the weekly equivalent of 50,000 IU) for 12 weeks in addition to their regular CF vitamin that supplied from 800-2000 IU vitamin D 3 daily. Cholecalciferol was conveniently administered orally as either one capsule 10,000 IU or one tablet 10,000 IU. All patients were instructed to obtain follow-up serum 25-OHD levels postcompletion of treatment. Serum 25-OHD concentrations were measured by a semi-automated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.",

The higher REE in females is well documented in other studies but is not significantly higher in this group suggesting a narrowing of the gap between genders. Puberty would not seem to exert an obvious impact on requirements in this group. The higher REE seen in those with better FEV1 and non-homozygous \u0394F508 genotypes was novel and it would be useful in future to interpret this alongside body composition and physical activity levels. Perhaps their health encourages improved exercise levels with higher muscle mass and thus higher REE. It is possible that those with PEG have lower REE due to reduced physical effort/muscle mass as a result of decreased lung function. Future studies should investigate muscle and fat mass and activity levels in tandem with REE.

To further investigate this, glucose tolerance tests (GTT) were performed on 8-week-old (male and female) F508del, R117H, and WT mice (C57BL/6J background) after a 12 hour overnight fast. The Table indicates that not only were the basal glucose values significantly lower in the CF mice, but the area under the curve (AUC) was also lower, indicating that CF mice were disposing of the glucose more rapidly than WT. Lower basal glucose values in CF mice correlated with higher ketone values, indicating they were oxidizing more fat than WT. Glucose and ketone values measured in the same mice under fed conditions, one week later, returned to pre-experimental levels, but still lower or higher, respectively, in CF mice. Lower fasting glucose in CF mice could be due to smaller glycogen pools since CF mice are smaller, and have less fat and muscle mass than WT. The female mice were tested again at 14-16 weeks of age, and sacrificed either fed or fasted for 6 hours or 12 hours. Total glycogen was measured in the livers of these mice (g glucose whole liver/kg body weight): WT fed 2.38 \u00b1 0.08, n = 5; 6 hour fast 0.61 \u00b1 0.1, n = 16; 12 hour fast 0.02 \u00b1 0.01, n = 14.

Livers from CF female mice had more glycogen than WT, either in the fed state or after 6hr fasting, yet blood glucose levels were lower, indicating that CF mice may have a problem releasing glucose from stored glycogen. Calorimetry was used to measure respiratory quotient (RQ) in F508del and WT male mice, 11 weeks old for 48 hours (4 each), last 12 hours without food. RQ indicated that in the presence of food, CF mice preferentially burned carbohydrates at night but fat during the day, more so than WT. When food was withdrawn at night, CF mice switched to fat stores sooner that WT. Our data indicate that pancreatic sufficient, young CF mice are able to use readily available carbohydrates as energy substrate and are more sensitive to their utilization presumably by the periphery (indicating enhanced insulin sensitivity at that age). However, they are less effective at accessing their stored glycogen and deplete dietary carbohydrates faster than WT. This metabolic scenario could contribute to glucose intolerance seen in CF patients even in the absence of CFRD.",

There are generally two ways that CF patients use to calculate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for each meal. By far the most popular is based on weight, lipase/kg patient/meal. A typical range is 500-2500 lipase unit/kg patient/meal. This may, however, not be the best way to assess required enzyme dosing and not the best for optimization of nutritional status. The alternative strategy is to calculate the grams of fat in each meal, and then to base pill strength on a known lipase units per gram of fat per meal. This is not commonly undertaken, although is an alternative that has been endorsed by the CF Foundation. This study's purpose is to assess the potential benefit in cystic fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) who use a smartphone app to manage dosing of pancreatic enzymes in order to optimize health and nutritional status.",

Longer follow-up may be needed to observe significant changes in lung function. Background and Aim: Fecal loss of bile acids (BA) is compensated for by de novo synthesis, which is regulated through a finely tuned homeostatic control mechanism to maintain a near constant body BA pool. One of its key elements is the direct activation of the nuclear receptor FXR in ileal epithelial cells by reclaimed BA: active BA uptake through ASBT (apical sodium-dependent BA transporter) triggers the production and release of the hormone FGF19 (FGF15 in mice), which represses hepatic expression of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholic acid (CA) synthesis. Because cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with enhanced fecal BA excretion and a concomitant increase in de novo synthesis, we hypothesized that FXR signaling is attenuated in the CF intestine.",

Attenuation of intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling was associated with a blunted hepatic trophic response and impaired repression of hepatic Cyp7a1 expression.

Acknowledgement: Supported by the Dutch CF Foundation (NCFS) as part of the HIT-CF program. It has been well established that CF mice exhibit reduced weight and reduced fat accumulation compared to wild-type (WT) controls (1) . We have previously demonstrated that CF epithelial cells and tissues exhibit reduced microtubule acetylation that can be corrected by inhibition of the cytosolic histone deactylase family member HDAC6. We generated F508del mice lacking the expression of HDAC6 (F508del/Hdac6) to determine what CF phenotypes could be attributed to microtubule alterations in vivo. One phenotype that is corrected in F508del Cftr mice by the ablation of HDAC6 is the restoration of fat accumulation and the associated increase in weight gain. The hypothesis of this study is that CFTR dysfunction in adipocytes impairs adipocyte differentiation through modulation of microtubule stability.",

Consistent with epithelial cells, CF 3T3-L1 cells exhibited 0.13 +/-0.02 fold reduction in acetylated tubulin levels compared to controls. It was also determined that the pre-adipocyte marker Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) was expressed 2.6 +/-0.4 fold greater in CF 3T3-L1 cells compared to WT cells. This increase in KLF2 expression is likely significant since it has been demonstrated that elevated KLF2 expression prevents pre-adipocytes from differentiating into adipocytes (2) . Quantitative RT-PCR also shows KLF2 mRNA levels were increased in CF 3T3-L1 cells 2.4 +/-0.4 fold over WT levels. Since F508del/Hdac6 mice are able to store fat, we examined whether HDAC6 inhibition could impact KLF2 expression. HDAC6 inhibition with tubastatin inhibited KLF2 expression in CF 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, destabilizing microtubules with nocodazole in WT 3T3-L1 cells results in a dose-dependent increase in KLF2 expression. These data suggest that microtubule stabilization via HDAC6 inhibition improves pre-adipocyte differentiation and allows for fat deposition in vivo. To verify these findings in primary tissue, epididymal fat from WT, F508del, and F508del/Hdac6 mice was examined for KLF2 expression. Consistent with the CF3T3-L1 cell model, KLF2 expression was significantly increased in F508del mice fat compared to WT mice and restored to WT levels in F508del/Hdac6 mice.",

Introduction: Liver disease is the second leading cause of mortality in CF and contributes to significant morbidity in many patients due to associated liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Current CF Foundation guidelines for CF liver disease (CFLD) screening include annual serum labs (LFTs, GGT, CBC, coags), with further workup indicated if AST/ALT are >1.5x normal, or there is evidence of nutrition-independent coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. Transaminases, while good indicators of non-CF liver disease, do not correlate well with CFLD, thus current screening primarily identifies end-stage liver cirrhosis when synthetic function is compromised and portal hypertension has developed. We suspect current guidelines are ineffective at detecting CFLD at early stages of fibrosis. Identifying early liver fibrosis will be of great importance to develop interventions aimed at halting CFLD progression to end-stage liver disease.",

Theisen, PhD, and Natalia Zhukovskaya, PhD, of Complete Publication Solutions, LLC, provided medical writing support, funded by AbbVie. The manifestations of CF gastrointestinal tract disease frequently begin during infancy, when pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI) results in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition leading to growth failure and even intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention and pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that PI is not the sole contributor to growth and nutritional failure. The identification of these growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. A growing body of evidence supports a role for the gut microbiota in nutrient harvest and metabolism, and these microbiota are often altered in a variety of disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may be important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with fecal measures of fat malabsorption and inflammation, further supporting a role in early CF growth and GI function.",

Background: Gut microbiota refers to the trillions of microorganisms in the human GI tract that play a central role in health, including in energy and macronutrient metabolism, nutrient capture and immune function. Emerging research suggests that gut microbiota may be disrupted in individuals with CF. CFTR-knockout mice displayed significantly less bacterial richness and diversity (parameters that usually associate with a healthy gut microbiota) compared to WT animals. Vitamin D deficiency, a common comorbidity in CF patients, may influence composition of the gut microbiota. Vitamin D deficiency can increase the severity of intestinal inflammation in the mouse colon that can be reversed by vitamin D supplementation. Similarly, in humans, high dose vitamin D supplementation resulted in a marked reduction in typical opportunistic pathogens and an increase in gut microbiota richness. Whether vitamin D affects the gut microbiota in CF is not known.",

            "text": "Summary: We will determine, for the first time in CF patients, whether high-dose vitamin D administration favorably modulates the gut microbiota over a 3-month treatment period. We will also relate changes in the gut microbiota to changes in lung function over this time. Beta-cell dysfunction in cystic fibrosis (CF) is widely accepted as the cause of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. It has been hypothesized that CFTR expression in beta-cells plays an intrinsic role in insulin secretion. Support for this hypothesis is largely based on the finding that CFTR inhibitors impair insulin secretion and chloride transport in beta-cells and/or isolated islets. We have also shown that isolated islets from newborn CF ferrets have impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), a finding that could be taken to support an intrinsic role for CFTR in islet insulin secretion. We sought to further investigate the mechanism of altered insulin secretion by CF ferret islets and to define the cell types within the pancreas and islets that express CFTR. Using single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH), we localized CFTR RNA expression in ferret and human pancreas and/or isolated islets. We found no evidence for CFTR expression in endocrine cells. Rather, a high level of CFTR RNA was expressed within CK7+ pancreatic ductal cells in both isolated islets and intact pancreas. Islets from neonatal CF ferrets demonstrated significantly blunted first (P<0.05) and second (P<0.05) phase insulin secretion as compared to non-CF controls. Similarly, knockdown of CFTR mRNA in wild-type adult ferret and human islets, using recombinant adenovirus expressing a CFTR-shRNA, demonstrated impaired GSIS as compared to a control shRNA. Importantly, while others and we have observed that CFTRinh172 reduces insulin secretion by islets, we find that this compound also significantly reduced insulin secretion and glucose-stimulated Ca 2+ -fluxes by CFTR-KO ferret islets, questioning the specificity of this inhibitor-based approach. To investigate the mechanism of altered insulin responses by CF islets, we evaluated transcripts involved in beta-cell function and maturation. Quantitative-RNA analysis demonstrated significantly lower insulin and glucagon transcripts in CFTR-KO islets but unchanged levels of glucose-sensing RNAs (GCK, GLUT2, and GJA9). Similarly, CFTR knockdown in WT ferret islets reduced insulin RNA expression. RNAs involved in transcriptional regulation of beta-cell maturation and proliferation (Neurod1, Ngn3, Pax4, Reg3a, and Serpinhb1) were increased in CFTR-KO islets, while PDX1 and MafB expression remained unchanged. Interestingly, the expression of the exocrine duct marker CK7 and markers of stellate cell activation and inflammation (alpha-SMA, Acta1, and TGF-beta1) were significantly increased in CFTR-KO islets. Consistent with this observation, newborn CF pancreata demonstrated higher levels of activated stellate cells (Desmin/alpha-SMA positive) as compared to non-CF. These results suggest that CFTR impacts beta-cell function via a paracrine mechanism through islet-associated duct and/or stellate cells. Elucidation of the signal pathway(s) by which CFTR mutant ductal cells affect islet function requires further investigation. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a common complication of CF and is a major risk factor for CF-associated morbidity and early mortality. The traditional hypothesis is that CFRD is caused by progressive destruction of the exocrine pancreas, which leads to collateral damage of pancreatic islets. However, there is little direct evidence for this \"collateral damage\" hypothesis. A recent study showed that CF patients who were pancreas-sufficient had enhanced acute insulin response to arginine stimulation, suggesting that insulin secretory capacity in pancreassufficient patients is enhanced rather than impaired. These data support an alternative hypothesis that CFTR may have an intrinsic role in the regulation of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion. To explore the mechanisms of dysregulated insulin secretion in CF, we created an inducible \u03b2-cell specific Cftr knockout mouse and a \u03b2-cell transfection system to overexpress CFTR.",

After inhibition of CFTR, these cells have delayed response to glucose stimulation and failed to return to baseline after removal of glucose. Mice with knockout of Cftr had normal \u03b2-cell mass, but islets isolated from these mice exhibit elevated [Ca 2+ ] i in presence of 3 mM glucose, suggesting an increased sensitivity to glucose stimulation. Islet perifusion showed that Cftr-/-islets had an increased sensitivity to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and a delayed turn-off of insulin secretion after glucose withdrawal. In contrast to wild-type mouse islets, Cftr-/-islets failed to show the normal transient increase in [Ca 2+ ] i in response to thapsigargin, suggesting an alteration in ER calcium handling. \u03b2-cells with overexpression of wild-type CFTR showed impaired responses to glucose stimulation.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel in the ductal epithelium of the pancreas plays a critical role in transporting bicarbonate into the lumen of ducts. Bicarbonate anions alkalinize the ductal lumen and in turn inactivate the pancreatic digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreatic acinar cells. The loss of function of CFTR in cystic fibrosis (CF) causes a pH imbalance in the lumen and the persisting acidic environment is thought to prematurely activate digestive enzymes leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of beta-cell function. We have developed a CFTR-KO ferret model that develops very similar pancreatic pathology to that seen in human CF patients. Using the CF ferret model, we sought to understand how the earliest phases of CF pancreatitis and exocrine dysfunction lead to endocrine pancreas abnormalities that influence insulin secretion. We hypothesized that neuroendocrine regulation during this phase is abnormal due to inflammation and that altered production of certain neuropeptides can negatively impact pancreatic endocrine function. Previously we have shown that newborn CF ferrets have impaired glucose tolerance and poorly regulated insulin secretion (impaired first phase insulin and accentuated second phase insulin secretion) despite normal islet cell mass (J Clin Invest. 2012; 122:3755) . Because isolated islets from CF newborn ferrets have similarly dysregulated insulin secretion, we hypothesized that the proinflammatory environment of the CF pancreas impairs functionality of islets. We screened plasma, urine, and pancreas for neuropeptides associated with inflammation and found calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and bradykinin (BK) were both present at elevated levels in newborn CF ferrets. Therefore, we sought to determine if CGRP and/ or BK impair islet hormone regulation and if so the mechanism of action.",

            "text": "To study the action of BK on islets, we first localized bradykinin receptor 2 (BDKR2) on the endocrine hormone secreting cells of islets and found it localizes to alpha-cells in humans and ferrets but in mice and rats BDKR2 localized to beta-cells. Interestingly, in older CF ferrets BDKR2 localized to both beta-cells and alpha-cells. Since CF rats and mice lack pancreatic exocrine and endocrine disease observed in CF humans and ferrets, we sought to understand how BK might differentially affect insulin and glucagon secretion in ferrets and mice. Under low glucose conditions, BK treatment reduced glucagon secretion by ferret islets (2-fold, P<0.05) while decreasing insulin secretion by mouse islets (10-fold, P<0.05). By contrast, under high glucose conditions BK enhanced the secretory index of glucagon (4-fold, P<0.05) while reducing the secretory index of insulin (2-fold, P<0.05) in ferret islets. Studies dissecting the effect of CGRP on islet hormone secretion are underway and preliminary studies suggest that CGRP enhances insulin secretion by ferret islets under low glucose conditions. We hypothesize that these neuropeptides influence glucose sensitivity of the islet and may contribute to the poorly regulated insulin responses observed in early CF pancreatic disease. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are at risk for kidney injury even before undergoing lung transplantation, because of prolonged exposure to aminoglycosides and complications of diabetes mellitus.

Using a second approach, we created a recombinant adeno-associated virus that expresses ferret PP and performed intramuscular injection of AAV2/1-PP in wild-type ferrets (6-7 weeks of age, N=3, 8.4e8 DNAase resistant particles/gram body weight). AAV2/1-PP infected ferrets demonstrated plasma PP levels ~6 fold (p<0.001) higher than uninfected controls at 2-3 weeks of age. MMTT studies on these animals at 3 weeks post-infection demonstrated improved glucose tolerance (p<0.01). Ongoing studies are evaluating whether recombinant PP expression enhances glucose tolerance in CF ferrets. We are also further delineating the mechanism of improved glucose tolerance in non-CF animals using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps with tracers to evaluate glucose metabolism in the liver and peripheral organs. Such studies may provide new insights into mechanisms of PP action on glucose metabolism and CFRD pathogenesis.

Combined with recent clinical data indicating improved growth in children with the G551D CFTR upon initiation of ivacaftor, our findings implicate a mechanism for direct influence of CFTR on bone length, providing an improved understanding for impaired growth.",

Methods: CF patients with and without cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) who underwent CGM as part of a research protocol within 12 months prior to starting ivacaftor/lumacaftor were recruited to undergo repeat CGM within 12 months post-initiation of ivacaftor/lumacaftor. HbA1c data were also collected at time of CGM wear. Exclusion criteria included changes in dose of medications affecting glucose metabolism (e.g. insulin, atypical antipsychotics, etc.) within the 3 months prior to CGM, and hospitalization or systemic steroids within the prior 6 weeks. CGM data were analyzed in 24-hour and night/day periods, and intra-individual pre/ post CGM measures were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank Test.

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a frequent comorbidity that produces impacts on pulmonary function (PF) and nutritional status (NS) which can be detected 3 to 6 years previous to diagnosis. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) defined as a fasting glycemia (FG) <126 mg/dL and 140-199 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of glucose on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), correlates with lower PF and poorer NS, although it is not clear whether these can be tracked retrospectively. Other glucose tolerance alterations such as indeterminate (INDET) category (normal FG and 2 hour, with values over 200 mg/dL during the test) can be detected by a complete OGTT. We hypothesized that patients with IGT and INDET have worse PF and NS and that these are present previously to the detection of the alteration.",

Objectives: The prevalence of CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is estimated to be 20% in adolescents and 40-50% in adults. Often CFRD is first seen during acute pulmonary exacerbations, steroid therapy, or when enteral feeding is commenced. Onset of CFRD is often asymptomatic, however, other clinical markers are frequently noted, such as weight loss or a decline in lung function. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the gold standard for diagnosis of CFRD in patients over 12 years in the UK, local policy is to start screening for CFRD at age 10 years using OGTT. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGMS) measures subcutaneous interstitial glucose levels continuously, and this test has recently been introduced at our center if clinical concern regarding unexplained deterioration of weight and lung function is raised. The aim of this study was to review the incidence of CFRD using CGMS to diagnose CFRD in comparison to OGTT.",

Results show that CGMS diagnoses glycaemic abnormalities more frequently in patients identified with clinical concern compared to OGTT. Earlier screening of CFRD using CGMS may identify glycaemic abnormalities earlier, which may prevent the clinical decline of patient before CFRD occurs. Hyperglycemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality while effective blood sugar control improves lung function, weight maintenance and overall health in individuals with CF. While insulin deficiency due to pancreatic \u03b2-cell destruction is a well-known contributor to CFRD, the role of glucagon, produced by pancreatic \u03b1-cells, has not been well characterized. Dysregulated glucagon secretion may contribute to overall glucose intolerance in CF, as it does in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Therefore the present study seeks to characterize glucagon responses to a standardized mixed meal challenge in subjects with CF. These data will be critical in understanding the basic pathophysiology of CFRD and in developing novel therapeutic options in managing CFRD.",

Thus far, we have not identified hypoglucagonemia, as would be expected with indiscriminate destruction of pancreatic cells, although the correlation between peak C-peptide and glucagon suggests loss of glucagon reserve may parallel C-peptide loss. Hyperglucagonemia in response to mixed meals, as seen in subjects with T1D, was not present in these 6 subjects. Additional subjects are needed to further verify our preliminary findings. The onset of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is associated with accelerated decline in lung function and ultimately an increase in mortality. Despite these effects on health outcomes, relatively little is known about the underlying mechanisms involved in the development of CFRD. However, it is known that the onset of CFRD is not abrupt, but rather is preceded by a period of prediabetes (CFPreD) that can last for several years. We have found that teens and young adults with CFPreD and CFRD have systemic redox imbalance to the oxidizing state and that glucose administration significantly worsens this imbalance. We therefore set out to determine whether young children with CF demonstrated evidence of abnormal glucose homeostasis and had similar derangements in redox imbalance that could be implicated in the development of CFRD.",

Taken together with our data in CF teens and young adults, these preliminary data are leading us to the concept that toddlers and young children can have acute systemic redox imbalance to the oxidized state when ingesting the simple sugar, glucose. Furthermore, because of loss of CFTR function, this acute imbalance may become chronic, pushing the patient along the continuum of CF prediabetes and ultimately CFRD.

Research has shown that early intervention for CFRD patients with insulin therapy can improve clinical outcomes including lung function and nutritional status. Intermittent insulin therapy can be used to treat patients with a positive screening for CFRD who have intermittently elevated blood glucose levels. However, little is known on whether this practice can produce positive outcomes for patients. In our center we sought to evaluate the clinical differences in nutrition status, lung function and demographic information of patients treated with chronic insulin therapy (pump or intensive insulin management) and compared to those treated with intermittent insulin therapy.",

The extent to which insulin therapy prevents or reverses these LBM deficits needs further exploration. Historically, individuals living with cystic fibrosis (CF) would gather strength and support by attending summer camps, community events, and support groups. However, medical guidelines recommend stringent separation of individuals with CF to reduce the risk of cross-infection. This study seeks to examine the impact of these recommendations on the social experiences of young adults with CF. A qualitative, exploratory, grounded theory approach was employed to understand the experience of young adults living with CF, with specific emphasis on the impact of social isolation on their lives. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with ten young adults aged 18 -25 diagnosed with CF. An interview guide was used to elicit information about how individuals with CF understand, experience, and perceive social isolation from others with CF, ways in which they experience isolation, and the impact isolation has on their medical and psychosocial development. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using grounded theory's constant comparative method. Analysis identified the importance of social connection and isolation as a common theme supported by participant's level of connection with others. Participants struggled to define normal in their daily lives. Increased practitioners' awareness of ways to support young adults with chronic illness to engage with the CF community may improve health and mental health outcomes. group existed within a reasonable distance, so it was decided to explore the development of such a group.

Rationale: At our hospital, inpatient stays for acute pulmonary exacerbations are 10-14 days for 10-17 year olds. Infection control policies designed to protect patients effectively confine patients to their room during their stay, which severely limits physical activity. Hospital stays are associated with depressed and anxious mood in children and adolescents. A systematic review found improved lung function with short-term in-hospital exercise, and exercise participation has been linked with improvements in mood in youth. The primary aim of the current study was to pilot test a self-administered exergaming program during hospitalization (a Microsoft Xbox/Kinect game system, which uses whole-body and limb movements). We hypothesized that the program would be feasible, as indicated by patient compliance with study procedures. A secondary aim was to compare youth who completed the exergaming protocol to an inpatient monitoring group on change in FEV1, physical activity levels, and psychological distress across the hospital stay.",

The pediatric team re-introduces the transition program to patients when they reach their early teens, a time when they are gaining independence. When ready, usually between 18 to 21 years of age, the adult pulmonologist meets the patient and family with the pediatric pulmonologist in the pediatric clinic. If the patient and family are not ready after this joint clinic session, the session can be repeated up to 3 times. Additionally, a tour of the adult inpatient and outpatient facilities is offered prior to transfer to adult care. This program was evaluated through 2 QI projects in 1992 and 2010. Following each evaluation, the transition process was modified to meet patients' expectations and improve patient satisfaction.

Patient opinions regarding when to transfer care should be considered. Patients reported significantly higher perceived health status both before and after transition. Patients reported that the most useful experience was meeting an adult physician in the pediatric clinic, followed closely by having a social worker help in the transition process. Formalized transition process is crucial to optimize patient health, continuity of care, and reduce loss to follow-up. Recently, the CF Rise transition readiness program was adopted by the center to help improve CF patients' knowledge and foster their independence as they move to the adult program. Abstract: In Canada all paediatric CF patients are required to transition to the adult CF clinic at the age of 18 regardless of their readiness or desire to transition. We have been told that this can cause anxiety and stress for both the patients and their families. Among the myriad changes encountered include an entirely new team, new clinic location and space, new inpatient setting, and shift to self-care model. Our current transition program starts at age 14 with the initiation of private discussion time with the paediatric health care team and a questionnaire that tracks development of CF knowledge and self-management skills. While this process does provide some level of preparedness in terms of knowledge and skill, patients and family still voiced anxiety about the actual physical experience of transition. Our Transition Night was created to provide an opportunity for transitioning youth and their families to meet and interact with the adult team, be introduced to the new clinic space and routines, meet other parents and be able to present their questions and concerns. Parents were invited to be present but due to infection control guidelines the youth were not able to attend in person. Therefore they were connected via live webinar feed. This gave them an opportunity to view the presentations, meet the adult clinic team and anonymously send in their questions. The evening session was recorded and posted on our CF clinic website and available as a teaching tool.",

Caregivers in SPH had diminished annual household income, with 83% of SPH earning <$50,000 versus 34% of TPH (p=0.03). Paternal education was similarly lower in these environments (p<0.02). The relationship between support and SES was most evident in SPH. Only 4% of SPH reported excellent support (>8/10). In contrast, 11% of TPH reported low levels of support (Likelihood ratio (LR) 22, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) 0.89, Specificity 96%, p<0.001). Low levels of perceived support (<8/10) associated with diminished clinical scores (<7/10) [LR 4.5, PPV 0.8, Specificity 0.89, p=0.02] . In particular, infants in SPH had overtly lower clinical scores (SP home: 5.1\u00b10.4 vs. TP home: 7.3\u00b10.4, p<0.01).",

Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR, USA Introduction: Assessment of emotional and behavioral functioning can facilitate patient and caregiver communication of behavioral health needs and facilitate appropriate referral and treatment of behavioral health problems. To better identify patients who may benefit from psychological evaluation an abbreviated screening tool that addresses the unique demands of clinical time constraints was developed for routine use at the Arkansas Children's Hospital's two CF center sites. The Pediatric Behavioral Health Questionnaire (PBHQ; an 8-item questionnaire that briefly assesses behavioral health across the following domains: anxiety, depression, behavior, academics, social, treatment, and family adjustment/stressors) was developed to increase the communication of behavioral health information for the purposes of identifying patient and caregiver service needs, standardizing the referral and routing of appropriate psychosocial treatment and services, and increasing access to care. Study aims included: establishing the internal reliability and external validity of the PBHQ and cross-validating the PBHQ with a validated psychological questionnaire.",

Families identified similar concerns: 1) future quality of life for their loved one given their current level of independence; 2) guidance on how to support their loved one and address his/her practical needs; and 3) connectedness to their loved one's CF care and health status. For both patients and family members, the timing and location for addressing ACP needs was important. Patients varied in their willingness to discuss ACP, but agreed about not having ACP conversations when they were experiencing an exacerbation; however, patients often had difficulty describing what time would actually be best. Family members endorsed the need and desire for ACP but were similarly unsure \"at what point\" to have these discussions. Both patients and family members thought of their needs as \"supportive\" rather than \"palliative,\" would choose to discuss their unmet needs with their CF practitioner rather than with another provider, and believed these discussions might be best done during a regularly scheduled CF appointment.",

It appears that over the last ten years preparation for transition and support following the transition process has succeeded in empowering many young patients to take over responsibility for their care, although a small number of mothers continue to be actively involved for many years. Professionals working in adult CF teams need to be aware that following transition from paediatric to adult care, young adults need encouragement and support to become independent however, mothers particularly continue to play an active role for a number of years post-transition. Little is known about the effect of social support on mental and physical health in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Adults with CF may face a unique set of clinical and psychosocial barriers affecting the attainment and maintenance of social support, including frequent hospitalizations, transition from pediatric care, change in primary support persons, and social isolation due to infection control policies.

CF Foundation Compass can help with many of these barriers and provides a glimpse into priority areas for many of the most vulnerable people with CF and their families. Caring for children with cystic fibrosis (CF) increases rates of parental depression. The International Depression Epidemiological Study (TIDES) in CF found elevated symptoms of depression on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in 37% of mothers and 31% of fathers, which were 2-3 times the rates in community samples (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2014; 69:1090-7) . In turn, parental depression increases the risk of depression in youth with CF (Quittner AL, et al.) and negatively affects the child's adherence and health outcomes (Barker DH, Quittner, AL. Pediatrics. 2016; 137e20152296) . As a result, The CF Foundation and European CF Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression recommend annual screening for depression in parent caregivers of patients with CF ages 0-17 with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or the shorter PHQ-2 based on staffing and resources (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2016; 71:26-34) .",

Due to low rates of caregiver depression observed in 2014 compared to the TIDES data, in 2015, caregivers of patients 0-17 years of age were randomized to screening with the PHQ-9 for half of the parents (last names A-L) and the PHQ-2 for the other half (M-Z).

Greater rates of caregiver depression were detected with the PHQ-9 as compared to PHQ-2 screening. Although a small sample, this suggests the PHQ-9 may be more sensitive for caregiver depression screening and preferred to the PHQ-2. Our data will be compared to caregiver screening from the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago when their data are available, by October 2016. Reasons for lower rates of caregiver depression could include: underreporting/failure to report to team at smaller center, different screening measures or a seasonal variation. Objective: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 30,000 people in the United States. Pancreatic insufficiency is prevalent and can result in malnutrition. Nutritional status is directly correlated with lung function in CF. A gastrostomy tube (GT) can be placed to assist in meeting nutritional goals. Research shows this treatment is beneficial and safe, yet the impact of this decision weighs heavily on caregivers. This study aims to examine the knowledge and attitudes regarding GT placement among caregivers of children with CF and explore the relationship with health-related quality of life. Methods: Caregiver and child pairs were recruited at regular pediatric CF clinic visits. Pairs were excluded if the child had a GT that was removed. A multidisciplinary team designed parallel surveys: one for caregivers of children with a GT, and one for caregivers of children without a GT. To establish internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha was calculated on the whole sample. Study subjects completed the appropriate Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) survey. Demographic and clinical data were collected from the electronic medical record.",

            "text": "Discussion: Many potential applications exist for data derived from medical claims. However, the first step must be reliably identifying the patient population. Once identified, claims-based data can fill an existing gap in our current knowledge. For example, current data collection includes medications prescribed, but claims-based data is more accurate regarding prescriptions that are dispensed. This may reveal patterns of nonadherence which may be addressed to improve health outcomes. Claims data facilitates tracking healthcare utilization as new therapies and practice guidelines are introduced. With payors asking for justification for costly therapies, this may be essential data to have in coming years. In addition, a validated method to identify patients based on claims paid will allow identification of patients across multiple CF centers. This can allow assessment of healthcare utilization, prescribing patterns and patient adherence both across centers and within CF centers. In addition, it allows, for the first time, the capture of aggregate data from those patients who do not attend CF centers or have chosen not to participate in the Registry.

Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Introduction: Evidence-based adherence interventions must be disseminated into clinics for patients to benefit. This requires training providers with a range of experience delivering behavioral interventions. Competence is the degree to which providers deliver intervention components skillfully, and is an important mediator of patient outcomes. We examined predictors of multidisciplinary healthcare providers' competence delivering a problem-solving (PS) intervention in iCARE, a national RCT at 18 CF centers across the US (N=607 adolescents).",

Participants completed the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), a validated HRQOL instrument (0-100 scale), and reported their employment status (0=not employed, 1=employed full-or part-time). Disease severity was assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and number of pulmonary exacerbations (hospitalizations or home IV treatment) over the preceding 4 months. Other demographic and clinical covariates that may be related to HRQOL included age, gender, education, weight percentile, diabetes, pancreatic sufficiency, and colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and/ or Burkholderia cepacia. Twelve stepwise hierarchical linear regression models were created, one for each CFQ-R domain; clinical and demographic covariates were entered first, disease severity second, and employment status third. Due to multiple tests, a Bonferroni correction was used to evaluate significance at the p<.05 level. Unstandardized regression coefficients (B) show the increase in CFQ-R domain scores for employed individuals. Unique variance accounted for by employment status is indicated by R 2 \u0394.",

Employment was most strongly related to role functioning (B=15.83, R 2 \u0394=0.09), health perceptions (B=13.36, R 2 \u0394=0.07), social functioning (B=9.70, R 2 \u0394=0.06), physical functioning (B=12.84, R 2 \u0394=0.05), and emotional functioning (B=9.18, R 2 \u0394=0.04).

Individuals with CF and parent caregivers are at increased risk for depression and anxiety than those in general population (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2014; 69:1090-7) . Psychological symptoms have been associated with worse health outcomes (Goldbeck et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014;6:CD003148). The CF Foundation and the European CF Society have set up consensus statements for screening and treating depression and anxiety in individuals with CF and parent caregivers. Intervention are designed based on the level of severity of depression and anxiety identified with annual screening (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2015; 71:26-34) .

            "text": "Conclusion: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are prevalent in patients with CF and parent caregivers. Adolescents reported more symptoms than adults and mothers reported more symptoms than fathers. Depression and anxiety symptoms in the mild range seem to be predominant in patients with CF and parent caregivers. Preliminary data confirm the importance of annual screening of depression and anxiety using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. This program was designed to address the issues pertaining to self-care among the inpatient cystic fibrosis (CF) population at Texas Children's Hospital. It was noted that the CF patients have developed a dependency on the nurses and ancillary staff to do things such as waking them up for breathing treatments, take medications, and maintaining good personal hygiene. The goal of the study is to gain a better understanding of the CF patient's feelings towards self-care during admissions. Requirements for participation in the study are admission to the hospital and being over the age of six years. The participants of the study earn points each day by actively participating in three breathing treatments, physical therapy, taking all prescribed nutritional supplements, and having good hygiene and good behavior throughout admission. Once the participants earn 33 points they are rewarded with coupons to either McDonald's or the Texas Children's Hospital Food Court. The participants are asked to complete a presurvey before starting the program and then a postsurvey just prior to discharge, then an additional postsurvey at their clinic follow-up in approximately 2 weeks after discharge. The survey is a rating system designed to obtain information on how important the patients feel that certain aspects of their health care are to them. Our hope with this study is to help find motivating factors for the inpatient CF patients to take charge of their own care and be the key component for their overall outcomes during hospitalizations. The study is currently taking place and thus far has 16 participants with 3 repeat admissions. It is our goal to complete this study by the end of May 2016 with enough information to determine if our inpatient rewards program has had a positive effect on our patients' overall well-being and self-motivation. Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and illicit drug use are prevalent within the CF population, with these behaviours having adverse health effects upon patients regardless of their treatment adherence. In an attempt to prevent the initiation and aid the cessation of risky behaviours within the CF population, factors associated with these behaviours firstly need to be identified. We therefore investigated beliefs associated with these behaviours within adult CF patients.",

A desire for normalcy was seen to be important to many, with literature acknowledging that this desire for normalcy can be accompanied with the engagement of normalised risky behaviours as a retaliation against the illness identity. Evidence of a life orientated perspective was also prevalent, with participants reporting that they engaged in risky behaviours for fun. Overall there was a reported lack of knowledge concerning consequences of risky behaviours, with many participants stating they had not been informed of these by their clinicians. This was in line with a transition evaluation conducted by the researcher, which indicated that many UK CF units do not integrate a discussion on risky behaviours into a patient's transition to adult care. However, the results of the current research highlight the importance of awareness, with patients who had good awareness of the consequences of risky behaviours often accepting that they cannot engage in such behaviours.",

More significantly, some patients dropped two categories of severity from moderately severe to mild (GAD-7) and moderate to normal (PHQ-4). Patients scoring higher on their initial questionnaire appear to respond better to this treatment; with this in mind we should consider auricular acupuncture as an adjunct to treatment in CF patients with high anxiety and depression scores. This could be a valuable adjunct to physiotherapy treatment which takes a more holistic approach and could help reduce the amount of medication required by a patient. With this technique the patient is responsible for pressing the acupuncture needle as little or as often as required/wanted, thus giving the patient more control of their own care. This can lead to improved adherence and improved quality of life. Background: Current guidelines recommend that patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) attend specialized clinics 4 times per year based on the finding that more frequent clinic visits were positively associated with higher lung function. However, historically, adherence to these guidelines has been variable and ranged from 35% to 90% in pediatric clinics. Patients attending The Prince Charles Hospital (TPCH) CF clinic are spread over a large geographic area and travel up to 2400km to be seen. This undoubtedly places an additional burden to the patient that is somewhat offset by outreach and telehealth clinics. The objective of this study was to identify the proportion of adult patients attending TPCH CF clinic the recommended 4 times per year, and to determine if adherence to this guideline was associated with any clinical characteristics, higher lung function and/or increased hospitalizations.",

Palliative care is an interdisciplinary model of care that coordinates an array of interventions with the intent of mitigating the suffering and illness burden experienced by patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses, and their families, from the time of diagnosis forward. The illness burden experienced by patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their caregivers is characterized by problems in many domains (eg, physical symptoms, psychological distress, and caregiver burden). This burden fluctuates over years and gradually worsens in the context of advanced illness. CF is representative of a type of chronic condition that is best managed by the integration of a palliative plan of care with routine care throughout the disease trajectory-an approach known as concurrent care. In this approach, interventions to address unmet need in defined domains of palliative care are undertaken throughout the course of the illness by CF professionals who have the support of palliative care specialists; referral to the specialist palliative care team is considered when illness is advanced, death is perceived to be soon, and problems are multiple and complex. At the present time, there are no existing models of concurrent palliative and primary CF care in the United States. The proposed study describes the implementation and mid-project evaluation of an innovative model jointly developed by the Cystic Fibrosis Center (CFC) at Beth Israel Medical Center (BIMC) and the MJHS Institute for Innovation in Palliative Care. Recruitment concluded in January 2015. Of the 160 patients and caregivers screened, 152 were eligible and approached for the study with 76 patients and 55 caregivers consenting to the study and 21 declining. Since the implementation of screening for symptom burden, patients have completed 852 monthly screenings in total. Of these screenings, 149 patients were triggered for a triage evaluation by a social worker in one or more of the following domains: global distress (78), severe distress from pain (62), severe distress from dyspnea (50), psychological distress (43), and/or a request for advanced care planning (40). Of these 149 patients triggered, 73 were reachable by phone and completed the triage evaluation, and 76 were missed due to the patient being unreachable by telephone but were seen at a subsequent clinic visit. All missed triages occurred prior to May 2015 at which point the staffing model was changed to improve follow-up. Since that time there have been no missed patients. Of the 72 patients who completed a triage, 23 required a follow-up by the CF Center clinicians and all 23 received this follow-up. We continue to screen patients monthly for symptom burden and unmet palliative care needs, and collect quarterly data on outcomes to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. In May 2016 we will be implementing a music therapy program specially designed for cystic fibrosis patients and assessing patient satisfaction through the web-based survey system. We present the case of a 14-year-old cystic fibrosis patient who perished as a result of complications from her disease coupled with her refusal of treatment. The patient was diagnosed at 11 months of life after her older brother was diagnosed with CF. Throughout the course of her life she had several admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit, some resulting in intubation. She had been diagnosed with Aspergillus pneumonia, MSSA and MRSA pneumonias, and eventually multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas pneumonia. At the time of her death her diagnoses included acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, insulin-dependent CF-related diabetes mellitus, pulmonary hypertension, and steroid dependency with secondary immunocompromise.",

Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA Background and Significance: Cystic fibrosis is no longer a disease confined to the pediatric population. As the life expectancy of those with CF continues to rise, it is important to prepare pediatric patients to live as independent adults. Transition and transfer are widely discussed within the CF community: \"The timing of transfer to adult CF care often coincides with a dynamic period in adolescents and young adulthood when lung function may be declining and treatment burden and complications of a multisystem disease are increasing.\" (Tuchman E, et al. Pediatrics. 2009; 125:566-73) . Questions of adherence complicate transition and transfer. Adolescents struggle with adherence related to increased care responsibility, treatment burden, perceived treatment benefit, and lack of education. Literature related to transition and transfer agrees on the need for standardized programs within centers. However, much of the literature discussing transition is descriptive, with measured outcomes relating to satisfaction and perceptions. Little has been done measuring quantitative health outcomes of transition programs, and there is no consensus on the best program to improve transition, (Tuchman E, et al.

School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Introduction: Although novel therapies have increased the average life-span of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) to 39 years, many individuals with CF still develop end-stage lung disease and lung transplantation remains an effective intervention that improves survival. The transition to lung transplantation is a complex process that involves shared decision between providers and patients that should take into account disease severity, social factors, and mental health physiologic criteria as well as social and mental health and requires multidisciplinary coordination. Despite advances in the transition process for CF from pediatric care to adult care, little is known about the transition process to lung transplantation for those patients with CF and end-stage lung disease. The aim of the study, therefore, is to evaluate how CF centers transition patients to transplantation and to understand the interaction between CF and transplant teams at CF centers.",

During inpatient stays, attending and resident physicians rotate on the units. Inpatient staff may become familiar with patients that are frequently readmitted; however, there is often limited in-depth knowledge of the recommended cystic fibrosis care guidelines. The resulting care provided to patients with cystic fibrosis can be fragmented and inefficient resulting in readmissions within 30 days. In the State of Illinois, Medicaid does not reimburse hospitals for readmissions that occur within 30 days of discharge; therefore, appropriate management of patients with complex health needs is not only important for the patient's long-term health, but also for the financial stability of the institution. Assessment: In 2014 there were 511 hospital days (days admitted in the hospital) for patients with cystic fibrosis. Of the 511 days, 99 were related to 30-day readmissions.

Twenty-four of 29 parent surveys were matched for pre-and post-survey comparison. Two questions were deemed ambiguous/unclear, answered incorrectly by 67% and 42% of parents on both pre-and post-surveys respectively. When these two questions were removed from the data set, no significant difference in pre-and post-parent survey performance was noted.",

No prior exposure to information was a likely factor in children's most significant improvement in scores across topics. Negligible improvement in nutrition content scores for parents may be due to unclear test questions where answer choices were either too similar, lacked personal relevance or education delivery method did not adequately meet adult learner needs. Children may benefit from individual, age appropriate education at an earlier age given score improvement within the child group.

Opportunities are numerous to introduce palliative care before patients with CF develop advanced disease, but there is no standardized approach to incorporating palliative care into routine CF care.",

Background: Ivacaftor/lumacaftor (Orkambi) was FDA approved for use in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in July 2015. Due to the number of drug interactions, lab monitoring requirements, and administration directions of ivacaftor/lumacaftor a protocol and education program was developed at a single pediatric CF center. The pharmacist-driven medication education program included a medication history/drug interaction screen performed by the pharmacist, ivacaftor/lumacaftor education with the pharmacist, and then follow-up education at the next clinic appointment. To facilitate this education an ivacaftor/lumacaftor education sheet was developed by the pediatric CF center pharmacist in collaboration with the adult CF center pharmacists.",

Background: Pediatric residents have limited opportunities to gain experience in the longitudinal care of CF patients.

It allows for a relationship that is mutually beneficial, enhancing the education of the resident and the care of patients. The 2014 NACFC meeting had as one of its emphases, introduction and discussion of newly updated CF infection prevention and control (IP&C) guidelines published in 2013. The importance of these new recommendations and the shared experiences of others with patientto-patient transmitted outbreaks in their CF centers in clinics and hospitals profoundly impacted our team. The decision was made to aggressively and quickly work to implement a more system-wide approach that would bring our IP&C practices more in line with the latest recommendations. Our children's hospital is located several miles from our outpatient practice and CF clinic, which also houses a lab and a radiology department.

These changes were of less magnitude for PS. Weight and BMI Z scores improved (+0.25 and +0.38, respectively, p<0.01) in PI with no change in PS. REE% decline tended to be greater in PI. TEE remained stable in both groups. Fecal elastase, higher at baseline in PS, increased by 52 to 390 \u03bcg/g stool in four out of six subjects. Conclusion: Treatment with ivacaftor resulted in improved weight, FFM, FM, pulmonary function and reduced REE and gut inflammation. The magnitude of these improvements was greater in subjects with CF and PI, suggesting that ivacaftor may be more effective in this group",

Recent studies suggest that infection and colonization of the sinonasal cavity precedes colonization of the lower respiratory tract (Hansen SK, et al. ISME J. 2012;6:31-45). In addition, acquisition of chronic bacterial colonization in CF patients strongly correlates with respiratory viral infection(van  Ewijk BE, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2005;4(2 Suppl):31-6). We recently reported that respiratory viral infection promotes the conversion of P. aeruginosa to biofilm growth in association with bronchial epithelial cells and hastens the development of antibiotic resistance(Hendricks MR, et al. PNAS.  2016;113:1642-7; Melvin JA, et al. mSphere. 2016;1:pii:e00083-16). Enhanced biofilm growth was attributed to dysregulation of iron sequestration by the bronchial epithelium during viral infection, demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo observations of increased iron in the airway surface liquid. The current study extends these findings by investigating the impact of viral infections on chronic bacterial colonization and microbial communities in the PN sinuses.",

Pulmonary, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Med Ctr, Lebanon, NH, USA Introduction: Many matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are expressed in response to inflammation and inflammatory diseases. In the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the upregulation of several MMPs correlates positively with pulmonary exacerbations and decreased lung function (Roderfeld M, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2009;8(5):338-47). CF patients have high levels of circulating bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their monocytes express a LPS-desensitized phenotype that impairs their ability to respond to bacterial stimuli (del Campo R, et al. PLoS ONE. 2011;6(12): e29577). Because MMP activity has been linked with creating a LPSdesensitized phenotype via cleavage of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM-1) in healthy human monocytes, we hypothesized that MMPs could play a modulatory role on the inflammatory immune response of CF monocytes (G\u00f3mez-Pi\u00f1a V, et al.

However, the cultures which underwent DST were decreased by half (215 [82.4%] vs. 115 [40.2%]). This decrease in DST resulted in a savings of about $90,000 in patient charges. The number of patients with at least one encounter in 2014 (n=250) and 2015 (n=245) was similar. The frequency of PEx was similar (1.02 vs 0.82 PEx/patient). The number of patients having at least one exacerbation per year was similar as well, 103 (41.2%) vs 87 (35.5%), p=0.19. The length of treatment was 14.8 days in 2014 and 2015. In average, patients were hospitalized for 10.1 days in 2014 and 9.7 days in 2015 for exacerbations. Conclusion: Establishing a practice of limiting DST for PA resulted in a marked reduction in testing and likely yielding considerable cost savings.

Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA Background: Declining lung function over time is a recognized aspect of the lung disease process in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, this decline in lung function shows considerable variability. If recognizable patterns of change exist in individual patients, defining these patterns could have important implications. Previously, Menendez et al. (Chest. 1980;77(2 Suppl):321-3) assessed patterns of FEV 1 and FVC over time in 49 CF patients. They postulated the presence of an inflection point (IP) in some patients such that prior to the IP, the FEV 1 /FVC ratio changes little with time and remains in the normal range, while after the IP, it steadily declines. Based on this IP concept, they separated patients into 4 groups: (1) IP observed; (2) all observations in pre-IP period; (3) all observations in post-IP period;",

Pulmonary, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA Introduction: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency is a common complication seen among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) due to fat malabsorption. Previous research has linked low 25(OH)D status to increased frequency of CF pulmonary exacerbations. The primary objective of this study was to examine the influence of yearly 25(OH)D levels on CF exacerbations.Methods: A retrospective sample of pediatric and adult CF patients was utilized. Eight years of 25(OH)D data were collected(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015) from the electronic medical record; the lowest value was recorded for patients with more than one 25(OH)D level per year. Frequency of exacerbations per year, defined as Akron Pulmonary Exacerbation Score \u2265 5 and/or provision of oral or parenteral antibiotic therapy, was obtained from PortCF. Exacerbation data were recorded as both a continuous (total number of exacerbations per year) and categorical (at least one exacerbation versus no exacerbations per year) variable. Average 25(OH)D and number of exacerbations per year were calculated. Longitudinal associations were analyzed using generalized estimating equations; a Poisson model was utilized for number of exacerbations per year and a binary model for the categorical exacerbation variable.Results: A total of 38 patients were included. The average 25(OH)D was 29.0 \u00b1 12.5 (range 9-85 ng/mL) and 0.5 \u00b1 1.0 exacerbations (range 0-6) were documented each year. 25(OH)D level was significantly associated with exacerbations. In the Poisson model, each 0.02 decrease in 25(OH) D increased the likelihood of having a CF exacerbation per year (p=0.05).",

A survey of 84 CF centres, conducted in 1994 at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) revealed that postural drainage and percussion (PDP), performed in tipped positions, was the primary ACT used with only a few centres using the Vest. Since then airway clearance courses have been taught on a yearly basis at the NACFC and include the following ACTs: PDP, Active Cycle of Breathing (ACBT), Autogenic Drainage (AD), Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP), Flutter, Acapella and High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO), with the aim of selecting an appropriate ACT for the individual with CF using a collaborative approach with the healthcare provider. Aim: To examine changes over the past 20 years in the use of ACTs in North America. To determine if there are differences in the ACTs used based on the age of the individual with CF.

It is unclear whether this also applies to coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Individuals with CF have several CAD risk factors including CF-related diabetes (CFRD), altered lipid metabolism, and a chronic systemic inflammatory state(Cross CE, et al. Chest. 2013;143(4):882-4). Surrogate CAD markers, such as endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular stiffness, are present in CF(Poore S, et al. Chest. 2013;143(4):939-45. Hull JH, et  al. Eur Respir J. 2009;34:1322-8). There are case reports of CF adults with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but this field has not been systematically studied(Perrin FM, et al. J R Soc Med. 2010;103 Suppl 1:S44-8).

In 2011 the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation supported the development and validation of a national CF Patient and Family Experience of Care Survey. Between 2012 and 2014 the survey was implemented at care centers undergoing re-accreditation. In 2015 the survey was updated and all care centers were invited to participate in the national deployment with the purpose of providing an opportunity for people with CF and family members to give feedback about their experience of care.",

However, lung functions improved in both groups similarly [12 %p(IQR 4 and 20)  versus 8 %p (IQR 2 and 22.5); p=0.41]. The median BMI and BMI percentiles were higher in the home IV group on admission, but the hospital IV group had more weight gain after therapy (p<0.0001). There was no difference between groups in time to first pulmonary exacerbation (p=0.47). Treatment related adverse events were rare in both groups.Conclusion: Home IV therapy for the treatment of PEX is safe and comparable to the hospital therapy in a selected group of children with CF.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DISPARITY BETWEEN VITEK AND ETEST VANCOMYCIN MICS IN THE TREATMENT OF MRSA BRONCHOPNEUMONIA IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS: A PILOT STUDYMcDade, E.J. 1,2 ; Moonnumakal, S.P. 2 ; Lamberth, L. 2 ; Hulten, K. 2 ; Mason, E. 2 ; Kaplan, S. 2 ; Hiatt, P. 2 1. Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA; 2. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA Background: MRSA is an important CF pathogen associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Vancomycin (vanc) is considered first line treatment for CF bronchopneumonia caused by MRSA. Vanc minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for MRSA vary by the detection method used with Etest resulting in higher MICs than standard methods. Studies in non-CF patients have reported that infections caused by vanc-susceptible MRSA with Etest MICs \u22651.5 \u03bcg/mL have been associated with treatment failure and increased risk of death. This study aims to determine the following: the difference between VITEK and Etest vanc MICs for MRSA isolated from CF sputum and the difference in clinical outcomes to vanc treatment for patients with high Etest MICs (>1.5 \u03bcg/mL) compared to those with low Etest MICs (\u22641.5 \u03bcg/mL). Methods: This retrospective, pilot study was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine IRB. CF patients with MRSA isolated from sputum cultures at the time of admission for treatment of CF bronchopneumonia and who were treated with IV vanc were included in the study. Patients were excluded from the study if the MRSA isolate was unavailable or if no pulmonary function testing was performed at the time of vanc initiation and completion. VITEK vanc MIC was performed for all isolates by the microbiology laboratory at Texas Children's Hospital, subsequently Etests were performed by the Baylor College of Medicine Pediatric Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory. Results of VITEK and Etest vanc MICs were compared.",

Dept. of Otolaryngology and Communication Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA; 2. Dept. of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA Introduction: Chronic sinonasal disease is common in CF patients as impaired mucociliary clearance results in blockage of the paranasal sinuses and biofilm formation that is difficult to eradicate. Prior studies demonstrated reduced bacterial growth following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), however few studies have examined the relationship between infection of the paranasal sinuses as it relates to pulmonary infection. Objectives: 1) To assess bacteriology of pediatric CF patients with sinonasal disease undergoing ESS and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); 2) To assess clinical utility of performing BAL at the time of ESS. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed for pediatric CF patients with sinonasal disease undergoing ESS at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin between 2004-2015. A pediatric pulmonologist performed BAL immediately prior to ESS. A total of 25 BAL and ESS specimens were collected for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Results: Sixteen patients undergoing 25 procedures were included with mean age of 5.6 years. We found 96% of ESS cultures and 80% of BAL cultures demonstrated bacterial growth. S. aureus and H. influenzae were the most commonly identified organisms in both sites. Bacteria grew in both the upper and lower airways in 76% of cases. Eight of 25 cases (32%) demonstrated matching upper and lower airway organisms with similar susceptibility profiles. Of these, 3 were in children <6 years old and 5 in >6 year olds. Among the 17 discordant cases, 29% showed no growth in one of the sites. Discussion: We examined a cohort of pediatric CF patients undergoing both ESS and BAL to better elucidate the nature of bacterial growth. The majority of both upper and lower airway cultures demonstrated growth of bacteria, however only 32% of cases demonstrated similar culture results. This data suggests that BAL at the time of ESS has a valuable role in the management of both sinus and pulmonary disease in CF patients. Further studies are needed to characterize the temporal relationship of bacterial colonization in the upper and lower airway, as well as to determine risk factors for sinus disease contributing to pulmonary infections.

            "text": "Introduction: CFTR modulator therapy in patients (pts) with CF is associated with multiple clinical benefits, including improvements in airflow limitation in vivo as measured by posttreatment increases in FEV 1 . Two independent but related physiological mechanisms may contribute to the improvement in airflow limitation: 1) increased effective airway luminal diameter (reduced airway narrowing); and 2) airway recruitment (opening of collapsed airways). Both can impact FEV 1 , but may have different effects on symptoms and other disease manifestations.Methods: A retrospective analysis of spirometry data from STRIVE (ivacaftor [IVA] in pts with G551D mutation) and TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT (lumacaftor/ivacaftor [LUM/IVA] in pts homozygous for the F508del mutation) studies explored the relative contributions of increased airway luminal diameter (increased [FEV 1 /FVC] ratio at fixed FVC=\u03b4[FEV 1 /FVC]\u2022FVC) and airway recruitment (increased FVC [\u03b4FVC] at fixed FEV 1 /FVC ratio=\u03b4FVC\u2022[FEV 1 /FVC]) following treatment. Results: Modulator therapy in pts with CF improved both airway narrowing and small airway recruitment. Based on spirometry indices, the majority of improvement in FEV 1 following IVA or LUM/IVA treatment at week 24 appeared to result from airway recruitment (mean [SD], IVA: 0.271 [0.275] L, 70% in gating; LUM/IVA 0.090 [0.205] L; 94% in homozygous F508del mutation). Increases were observed within 2 weeks of treatment initiation and persisted through 24 weeks.Conclusions: This analysis highlights a unique physiological benefit of CFTR modulator therapy, which is distinct from simple bronchodilation and appears to contribute to clinical improvements associated with this new class of agents.Sponsored by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.Background: CF patients have improving survival estimates, but there are no modern studies of survival in CF patients with low FEV 1 in the US.",

Mean vitamin D supplementation increased from 780 to 1614 IU daily and mean 25(OH)D levels from 67.6 to 82.4 nmol/L. Results showed that 75.9% of all patients received 1800 IU daily, as per protocol.

Abbvie, Inc, North Chicago, IL, USA; 2. Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA; 3. Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USABackground: Nutrition status is associated with pulmonary function and survival. Body mass index percentile (BMI%) peaks at 4-6 years of age and predicts outcomes in adulthood. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) dose role in meeting nutritional goals in children is not well understood.Objective: Study relationship between PERT dose and nutrition status in children 2-6 years old at US care programs.Methods: Retrospective analysis of CFF Patient Registry from 2010-2014. Patients 2-6 years old on PERT identified and grouped by care program. Programs with less than 10 subjects were excluded. Descriptive analysis was performed. Programs were ranked by 2014 BMI% to establish nutritional status quartiles. Median PERT dose, lipase units per kilogram per largest meal, at top and bottom quartile programs was compared. Analysis was repeated ranking programs by height and weight-for-age percentile.Results: 3,298 patients and 60 programs were included. Median 2014 BMI% at top and bottom quartile centers was 64.25 and 50.60, respectively (p = < 0.0001).(Table.) No significant difference in PERT dose exists. Similar results noted when programs are ranked by height and weightfor-age percentile.Conclusion: Meaningful differences in nutrition status exist across programs. Since 2010, median BMI% decreased at lowest and increased at top quartile centers. No significant difference in median PERT dose exists at top and bottom quartile programs. Multivariable modeling accounting for bias may lead to different conclusions. Further analysis is planned to understand the relationship between PERT and nutrition status.Funded by Abbvie, Inc.DECLINE IN SUMMER NUTRITIONAL STATUS IN CHILDREN WITH CFMcPhail, G.L. 1 ; Santoro, K. 1 ; Taylor, J. 1 ; Weiland, J. 1 ; Mullen, L. 1 ; Siracusa, C. 1 ; Filigno, S.S. 2 1.

Early screening is essential.Objective: To document evolution of glycemia, insulinemia and glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) in CF pediatric patients.Method: Chart review of 137 patients followed at the CHU Sainte-Justine CF Clinic between 1993 and 2014. We collected results from annual oral glucose tolerance test, and insulinemia of 119 pancreatic-insufficient (PI) and 18 pancreatic-sufficient patients (PS) aged 10 to 18. We also recorded HbA1c from age 1 to 18.Results: Between 10 and 18 years, prevalence of normal glucose tolerance (NGT) decreased from 84 to 61% whereas impaired glucose tolerance and new CFRD increased from 13 to 32% and 3 to 7% respectively in PI patients. All PS patients remained NGT. Mean fasting glycemia increased from 5.3 to 5.9 mmol/L in PI patients but remained stable at 5.0 mmol/L in PS patients. Two-hour glycemia increased from 6.5 to 7.5 mmol/L in PI vs 5.3 to 6.2 mmol/L in PS patients. Fasting and 2-hour insulinemia increased from 31.2 to 34.6 pmol/L and 162.6 to 268.5 pmol/L in PI patients. PS patients displayed marked fluctuations of their insulinemia with values ranging from 33.0 to 72.1pmol/L (fasting) and 219 to 365 pmol/L (2-hour). Between the age of 1 and 18 years, HbA1c increased gradually from 5.4 to 6.2% in PI vs 5.0 to 5.4% in PS patients.Conclusion: We observed a decrease in glucose tolerance in PI patients with time characterized by an increase in fasting and 2-hour glycemia and insulinemia between the ages of 10 and 18. Increase in 2-hour insulinemia and glycemia might suggest insulin resistance. Interestingly, HbA1c values were higher in PI vs PS patients as early as 1 year old. Our findings emphasize the need for early monitoring of CFRD. Acknowledgements: Cystic Fibrosis Canada, Dartmouth Institute of Healthcare Microsystems.",

EA 7425 HESPER, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon1, Lyon, France; 3. Medical department, French CF patient organization Vaincre La Mucoviscidose, Paris, France Introduction: Extrapulmonary comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, increase with age according to various cystic fibrosis (CF) registries. Many of these comorbidities are also strongly associated with transplantation. About ten percent of French CF patients are transplanted. Almost all of them are adults representing twenty percent of adult CF population. We describe here the prevalence of different extrapulmonary comorbidities (diabetes, bone disease, renal insufficiency, deafness, and depression) in adults from the French CF Registry and compare their respective prevalence in nontransplanted (NT) and transplanted (T) patients.Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of all adult CF patients attended in 2014 in a CF center and included in the French CF Registry. Patients were classified in two groups according to their transplant status, whatever the year of transplantation.Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare the prevalence of comorbidities between transplanted and nontransplanted patients.Results: 3339 adult patients were included in the French CF registry in 2014 representing 52.5% of the whole population in 2014. The main characteristics of the patients are described in the Table. 66% of T patients were diabetics compared with only 21% NT patients (p<0.0001). The major prevalence of diabetes was observed in the 35-39 age population in both groups with respectively 75% in T group and 28% in NT group (p< 0.0001).Bone disease was reported in 20% of T group and only 7% of NT group (p <0.0001). Renal insufficiency was very rare in NT patients (0.2%), and reported in 6.5% of T patients (p <0.0001). Deafness was observed in 11% of T group comparing to 6.2% of NT group (p <0.0001). Depression was reported in 7.7% of T patients and 5% of NT patients (p< 0.0048).Conclusion: Adult transplanted patients represented 20% of the French CF adult population in 2014. Most comorbidities and particularly diabetes mellitus are significantly more frequent in T patients whatever the age group. Data analyses from national registries have to take into account the transplanted status not only for pulmonary function but also for other comorbidities.",

Anesthesia, Nationwide Childrens Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA Introduction: Donation after circulatory death (DCD) is an emerging strategy for increasing the availability of donor lungs beyond what is attainable using donation after brain death (DBD). Notwithstanding reported success of lung transplantation (LTx) from DCD donors, implementation of DCD programs remains incomplete in LTx centers. We sought to identify the extent to which DCD LTx has been performed in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and compare survival between CF patients receiving lung allografts from DCD and DBD donors.Methods: LTx performed between May 2005 and March 2015 were identified in the United Network for Organ Sharing registry. CF patients receiving LTx at a center that performed 1+ DCD LTx during this period were selected for analysis. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to compare patient survival between DCD and DBD LTx in CF. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusted the estimate of the DCD effect for patient age, patient gender, forced expiratory volume in 1 second at LTx, and transplant year. The baseline hazard was stratified on LTx center to determine within-center survival differences attributable to use of DCD allografts.Results: There were 26 centers performing 1-64 (median=9) DCD LTx in 2005-2015. These centers accounted for 1,215 LTx in CF patients, of whom 35 (3%) received DCD allografts. Among CF patients, mortality was similar between DBD (33%) and DCD (34%) LTx, as illustrated further in the Kaplan-Meier plot ( Figure; log-rank test p=0.747). Cox regression stratified on LTx center identified no difference in mortality hazard between DCD LTx (HR=1.27; 95% CI: 0.66, 2.44; p=0.478) and DBD LTx in CF performed at the same center.Conclusions: Many CF patients receive LTx in centers with established expertise in DCD, although use of DCD in organ procurement for LTx in CF remains rare. The lack of a difference in patient survival between CF patients receiving DCD LTx and those receiving DBD LTx suggests DCD LTx could be adopted more widely to increase lung allograft availability for LTx candidates with CF. 3. Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; 4. UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust, London, United Kingdom; 5. Royal Brompton Hospital, London, United Kingdom Background: Using patient registry data to conduct international comparisons of health among people with cystic fibrosis (CF) may highlight differences in health care and health outcomes between different countries. However, differences in data collection methods necessitate developing strategies to make the data comparable. Specifically, the US CFF Patient Registry (US) captures multiple clinical visits per year with current clinic information versus a single annual visit reflecting events since previous annual visits in the UK CF Trust Patient Registry (UK). Since outcomes The delivery of aerosol medications is one of the cornerstones for CF management. In many of the original drug studies of CF aerosol medications such as Pulmozyme and TOBI, the nebulizer compressor was specifically identified. 1, 2 In the current Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans, the nebulizer compressor supplied to the CF patient is determined by the networked durable medical equipment company. The supplier selects a compressor based on lowest cost regardless of the standards established for the Pulmo-Aide compressor (DeVilbiss, Somerset, Pa.) . In previous studies, different nebulizer compressors have shown variation in the delivery of PSI and the maximal available PSI 3 , minimal standards established for the Pulmo-Aide compressor. The Re-Education of Airway Clearance (REACT) Quality Improvement Process is an established method to assess airway clearance and adherence in the CF population. 4 The REACT process to date has not included the evaluation of proper nebulizer function and output.",

            "text": "Methods: The REACT program with a nebulizer compressor evaluation tool was examined over a 12-month period at our four Nemours CF clinics across central Florida with patients aged 11 to 20. The data were collected by the respiratory therapists and analyzed by the medical team.Results: A total of 20 patients were studied for adherence to therapy and for nebulizer compressor function. Only 3 (15%) of the patient were totally adherent with adequate therapy vest settings. Seventeen (85%) of the patients required adjustment to their vest settings, vest garment and/or vest re-education. Nine (47%) of the patients' nebulizer compressors (19 evaluated) failed and were replaced due to lack of operating PSI or maximal PSI achieved. The average operating PSI was 29.05 (Normal >30) with the average operating PSI range from 0 to 45 and the average opening pressure was 9.1 (Normal >10) with the average opening pressure range from 0 to 20.Conclusions: Despite a small sample size, a significant number of patients were nonadherent or required adjustment of the vest settings. A large number of the patients' compressors were unable to provide adequate PSI output or unable to handle the higher back pressure associated with some of the nondisposable nebulizer cups. Poor compressor output can result in nontherapeutic aerosol production along with prolonged treatment delivery times. As delivery time increases adherence is likely to decrease. This process can lead to an increased CF exacerbations with an associated decline in baseline lung function. 3 1. Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, USA; 2. Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA; 3. Behavioral Health and Nutrition, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA Objective: To examine macronutrient intake and its impact on growth among children ages 2-6 years diagnosed with CF with pancreatic insufficiency (PI).Methods: Seventy-eight children aged 2-6 years (mean=3.8 y) with CF and PI participated in an RCT at 7 CF centers that compared behavioral and nutrition (BN; n= 36) to education/attention control (n=42) conditions aimed at improving intake and growth. Dietary intake was assessed over 7 days at baseline (BL) and 6-month posttreatment using weighed diet records. Dietary data were analyzed using Nutrition Data System for Research Software. Weight and height were assessed at both time points to calculate weight for age (WAZ) and height for age (HAZ) . In this secondary data analysis, descriptives were calculated for total average energy intake (kcal/day), % kcal intake by macronutrient per day, and protein (g/day) at time point and by condition. Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) was calculated at baseline. Inferential modeling was used to examine a main effect of treatment and time, and a treatment by time interaction with age as a covariate.Results: Mean energy intake for the entire sample at BL was 1462 (329) kcal/day and EER = 109.5% (25.8), with no difference between treatments. After adjusting for age, there was a significant interaction between treatment and time (P<0.0001). The BN group had higher mean intake, compared to control at 6 months (\u0394 LS means \u00b1 SE, P: 395.8 \u00b1 87.4, P<0.0001, resp). Relative to BL, BN improved intake at 6 months 590w DEPOT-SPECIFIC ALTERATIONS IN FAT TISSUE MORPHOLOGY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS MICE Henderson, L.C. 1 ; DiScenna, A. 2 ; Bederman, I. 2 ; Drumm, M.L. 2, 1 1. Genetics & Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA; 2. Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve Univ., Cleveland, OH, USA Low body mass indexes of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are typically attributed to lung disease and nutrient malabsorption. However, CF mouse models display a lean body type despite lack of lung disease and nutrient malabsorption. Others have reported expression of CFTR in adipose tissue (Ollero, et al. J Cell Physiol. 2004; 200:235-44) , leading us to hypothesize that Cftr expressed in adipose (fat) tissue contributes to low fat stores.Methods: We measured Cftr mRNA expression in 5 fat depots of WT mice. RNA was isolated from the cardiac, epididymal, interscapular, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and inguinal subcutaneous fat depots. Real-time PCR was used to assess gene expression. We tracked fat accumulation in WT and CF mice by MRI at 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age. We compared the histological morphology of two fat depots in mice at 6 weeks of age. Epididymal and interscapular adipose tissue slices were stained with H&E or co-stained with anti-perilipin A (a lipid droplet membrane protein) and DAPI. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (version 1.50) .Results: Cftr is expressed in adipose tissue at low levels (at least 11 times less than in lung tissue). Cftr expression varies by fat depot: epididymal expresses the most Cftr; interscapular, the least. Preliminary data suggest Cftr is more highly expressed in mature adipocytes than in stromal vascular cell types (including pre-adipocytes). Intraperitoneal fat is undetectable in CF mice at 4 weeks of age (0.28 \u00b1 0.21cm 3 in WT), but increases by 8 weeks (0.38 \u00b1 0.09cm 3 CF, 0.90 \u00b1 0.08cm 3 WT). Subcutaneous fat volume tracks with body weight in both CF and WT mice. In CF mice, lipid droplet diameter is increased (35 \u00b1 16\u03bcm CF, 30 \u00b1 13 WT) and nuclear density decreased (568 \u00b1 255nuclei/mm 2 CF, 774 \u00b1 179 WT) in the interscapular depot, but unchanged in the epididymal depot (43 \u00b1 13\u03bcm CF, 42 \u00b1 14 WT; 411 \u00b1 175 nuclei/mm 2 CF, 349 \u00b1 68 WT). The mass of the epididymal depots is smaller in CF mice (60.8 \u00b1 0.6mg CF, 82.8 \u00b1 1.73 WT). Macrophage infiltration, which indicates inflammation, was nearly absent in both CF and WT histological samples.Conclusions: There is evidence that Cftr expression in the adipocyte plays a role in adipose tissue morphology. Possible mechanisms include altered differentiation into mature adipocytes or CFTR interaction with the \u03b23-adrenergic receptor in the mature adipocyte (Robay, et al. Mol Pharmacol. 2005; 67:648-54) . Functional studies are underway to examine effects of CFTR dysfunction on adipocyte differentiation as well as white to beige cell transition, which may explain energy expenditure anomalies associated with CF.Supported by the NICHD of the NIH under Award Number F31HD080320.",

As of 6/30/16, 137 infants were enrolled at 1.6\u00b10.8 mo. Of 124 infants who reached age 6 mo by 6/30/16, 3 withdrew at age 3 mo, 9 had low birth weight, 19 had meconium ileus (MI), 82 had no MI but were pancreatic insufficient (PI), and 11 were pancreatic sufficient (fecal elastase consistently >200 \u03bcg/g). This preliminary analysis focused on the 82 infants who were PI without MI.Results: Of the 82 infants, 73% were exclusively breastfed (exB), 18% exclusively formula-fed (exF), and 9% received both (B&F) initially. However, the exB rate decreased to 48%, 34%, and 16%, while the exF rate increased to 23%, 35% and 51%, by 1, 2 and 6 mo respectively.By 6 mo, 47 infants had received fortified breast milk and/or high caloric density formula (22-33 kcal/oz). However, weight, length and weightfor-length percentiles during age 0-6 mo were 15-20 percentiles (p<0.01), 10-15 percentiles (p=0.02) and 5-10 percentiles (p=0.05) lower compared to the unfortified group. In the first 3 mo, the unfortified group had greater weight gain (31 g/day) than the fortified group (25 g/day), p<0.001. In the fortified group, fortification was begun by 47%, 21% and 32%, at 1 mo, 2 mo and 3-5 mo respectively. Weight gain (g/day) from 0-6 mo did not differ significantly by age of initiating fortified feedings.Of the 35 infants who received unfortified feedings, 12 were exB for 6 mo, 11 were exF by 1 mo of age, and 12 transitioned to B&F or exF at 1-5 mo of age. Weight and length percentiles declined from birth to 2 mo in all feeding types (55 th to 36 th and 62 nd to 38 th , respectively). Weight and weight-for-length percentiles improved to 55-60 th at 6 mo in exF and B&F fed infants but remained low in exB fed infants (35-40 th ), p=0.011 and p=0.029, respectively. In addition, exB for 6 mo was associated with lower weight gain at 4-6 mo (16 g/day) compared to exF (21 g/day) and B&F (22 g/day), p=0.002.Conclusions: In infants with PI who received unfortified feedings throughout the first 6 mo of life, prolonged exclusive breastfeeding was associated with lower weight percentile and weight gain at age 4-6 mo compared to formula or mixed feedings. An inverse association between fortified feeding and growth was observed, most likely a result of \"need-driven\" intervention, i.e., growth faltering prompted initiation of fortified feeding, rather than prevention-based treatment, i.e., proactive fortified feeding to prevent growth faltering and increase the likelihood of maintaining normal growth. The effectiveness of the latter approach on achieving optimal growth remains to be investigated.( Background: Nutrition dogma for the last three decades has centred around a high energy (120-150% of normal requirements) and high fat (40% of total energy) diet for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). There have been numerous dietary intake studies that have focused on whether children are meeting these targets but a paucity of data on dietary patterns. Anecdotally families find it more achievable to meet these elevated targets through non-core foods (energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods that offer little nutritional properties such as chocolate, potato chips, ice cream, sausages and processed meats). A consequence of this may be consumption of less core foods (nutrient-dense foods that when consumed in appropriate amounts meet a child's nutritional requirements; these include fruit, vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, lean meats and dairy). This study aims to quantify the contribution of core and non-core foods to the diet of children with CF compared with healthy controls and to explore any socioeconomic or gender effects. IVACAFTOR TREATMENT RESULTED IN  WEIGHT GAIN, IMPROVED PULMONARY FUNCTION  AND GROWTH STATUS, AND REDUCED RESTING  ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND GUT INFLAMMATION  IN PEOPLE WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS GATING Aim: To identify outcomes associated with weight gain and improvement in pulmonary function after 3-mo ivacaftor treatment.Methods: Subjects (\u22655 years old) with one or more CFTR gating mutations were recruited from the USA, Canada and Italy. Height, weight and BMI were measured and Z scores calculated for those <20 years of age. Fat free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), % body fat (%Fat) were determined by whole body dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Forced expiratory volume at one second percent predicted (FEV 1 %) was assessed by spirometry. Total energy expenditure (TEE) in kcal/d was assessed using doubly labeled water method. Resting energy expenditure (REE%) was assessed after an overnight fast by indirect calorimetry, and expressed as kcal/d and % predicted (Schofield). Fecal calprotectin (\u03bcg/g stool) as an indicator of gut inflammation and fecal elastase (\u03bcg/g stool) to indicate pancreatic status were assessed from spot stool samples.Results: A total of 23 participants (5-61 y, mean age 17.3\u00b113.0, 61% female, 91% Caucasian, 74% pancreatic insufficient) completed the study. Significant weight gain (+2.5 kg) and improvement in FEV 1 % (~10%) were confirmed with 3-mo ivacaftor treatment. BMI and FFM, FM and %Fat also significantly increased. For participants <20 yrs (n=18), weight and BMI Z scores increased significantly (+0.20 and +0.29, respectively, p<0.01) over 3 months. Energy balance changed as REE% declined (~6% predicted) and TEE remained stable (2184 to 2237 kcal/d). Fecal calprotectin declined by 30 \u03bcg/g stool, indicating reduced gut inflammation. Fecal elastase increased >50 \u03bcg/g stool in four out of six subjects with pancreatic sufficiency. The 3-mo change (\u0394) in weight was positively associated with \u0394FEV 1 % (r=+0.46, p=0.028), and negatively with \u0394REE% (r=-0.50, p=0.017). \u0394FEV 1 % was positively associated with \u0394weight and negatively with \u0394REE% (r=-0.64, p=0.001), \u0394REE kcal/d (r=-0.59, p=0.004), and \u0394calprotectin (r=-0.49, p=0.022).Conclusion: 3-month ivacaftor treatment resulted in weight and BMI gain and improved pulmonary function in people with CFTR gating mutations. Increases in both FM and FFM compartments contributed to weight gain. Improved lung function was associated with weight gain and with reduced REE and gut inflammation. Introduction: Food insecurity is defined as not having reliable access to an adequate supply of affordable, nutritious food. Texas has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the country, with 18 percent of households experiencing food insecurity, compared to the national average of 14 percent. Maintaining sufficient supply of food is important for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) due to increased physiologic demand for nutrients and poor absorption. Poor nutrition status is correlated with decline in pulmonary function in patients with CF (Bell SC, et al. Clin Nutr. 1998; 17:211-5) . Food insecurity is associated with an increase in depression and decrease in adherence to medical treatments in other chronic diseases (Silverman J, et al. J Gen Intern Med. 2015; 30:1476-80) . Due to the high food insecurity rate in our state, and the potential consequences related to malnutrition, it is important to address food insecurity to help our patients with CF maintain their overall physical and mental health.Objective: The Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center is a large adult center in Houston, Texas. There are 255 active patients in the 2015 registry data set. Our goal is to identify patients with food insecurity and assist them by providing resources they can use to acquire healthy food. To achieve this, we will provide information about resources such as government assistance programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), local food banks, and other nonprofit organizations.Methods: We created a food security assessment process that we implemented during our annual social work and dietitian evaluations to screen patients that may be at risk for food insecurity. This food security assessment included asking every patient seen by a social worker or dietitian during an office visit whether they felt they had adequate resources to obtain healthy food.Results: In our pilot study, we surveyed 80 patients in the BCM Adult CF Center in a 3-month time frame and found that 25% reported difficulty in affording adequate healthy food. Of the 80 patients surveyed, 33 patients were covered by Medicare or Medicaid as their primary or secondary health insurance. Of the 33 patients on Medicaid or Medicare, 80% reported struggling with affording healthy food. Out of the 80 patients surveyed, 14% were already signed up for SNAP benefits, however, 64% of those already receiving benefits continued to report difficulty obtaining healthy food due to inadequate funds.Conclusion: From these data, we determined that the populations of patients that are most likely to be food insecure are students, under-or unemployed workers, and individuals on government assistance. Patients meeting these demographics should be screened for food insecurity on a yearly basis. We plan to partner with a local food bank that offers assistance with the SNAP application process to maximize benefits our patients receive, as well as complete follow-up assessments to determine if resources provided have decreased food insecurity. 1 1.

Pediatrics, Madison, WI, USA Background: Optimal pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) dosage is unknown for infants with CF. The 2009 CFF Infant Care Guidelines adopted the dosages established in the 1990s based on preventing fibrosing colonopathy. It is recommended that PERT be initiated at a dose of 2000-5000 lipase units/feeding (fdg) but not exceed 2500 lipase units/kg/ fdg or 10000 lipase units/kg/day. Acid blockers (H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (PPI)) can be prescribed to treat adverse GI symptoms and/ or help improve enzyme efficacy; however there are no current guidelines for use in infants.Objectives: To characterize PERT dosing patterns and use of acid blockers in infants with CF during the first year of life.Method: The study population includes 96 infants born during 2/2012-12/2014, diagnosed through newborn screening, and enrolled at age 1.6 \u00b1 0.8mo in FIRST (Feeding Infants Right\u2026 from the STart), a multicenter prospective study being conducted at 5 CF centers (Madison, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Salt Lake City, Boston) to identify optimal feeding for infants with CF. PERT dose, feeding patterns and medication use are assessed at monthly CF center visits through 6mo of age and bi-monthly visits through 1 year of age.Results: PERT was prescribed to 88 (92%) infants. At 2mo of age 1% received >2500 units/kg/fdg and 29% received >10000 units/kg/ day. At 12mo of age 9% received >2500 units/kg/fdg and 39% received >10000 units/kg/day. Center variation was found to be the most significant factor influencing PERT dosing. At 2mo of age, the percentage of infants exceeding 10000 units/kg/day at each center was 7%, 18%, 27%, 67%, 100% respectively (p<.0001). At 12mo of age these percentages increased to 25-89% (p=.005). Acid blocker use was reported in 66% (n=63) of infants in the first year of life. Of the 63 who took an acid blocker 44% (n=28) received only H2 blocker, 19% (n=12) only PPI and 37% (n=23) received both. Of the infants who received both, 91% (n=21) changed from a H2 blocker to a PPI. Acid blockers were initiated at 2.6 \u00b1 2.3mo with 71% starting before 3mo of age. The average duration on either H2 or PPI was 6.4 \u00b1 3.7mo. Acid blocker use was found to vary significantly by center. The percentage of infants on an acid blocker at each center was 25%, 31%, 60%, 82% and 97%, respectively (p<.001). One center started acid blockers significantly later than the other 4 centers (p=0.004) but the duration on acid blockers did not significantly differ among sites (p=0.4). At 2, 6 and 12mo of age, no significant difference in enzyme dose or percent of infants exceeding >2500 units/kg/fdg or 10000 units/kg/day was found between infants receiving acid blockers and those not. Infants on acid blockers tended to have lower weight and length percentiles, but these differences were not significant.Conclusion: Our study shows one-third of infants exceeded maximum PERT dosage and two-thirds received acid blockers. Clinician prescribing practices significantly influenced both PERT dosages and acid blocker use. Potential benefits (improved growth/GI symptoms) versus risks of high PERT dosages and extended use of acid blockers remain to be investigated.Funded by NIH R01DK072126, UL1TR000427, CFFT-LAI14A0. 2.

Assess use of the BIVA Device compared to Ins/Outs and clinical assesement to measure body water status in hospitalized patients.Methods: This prospective cohort study thus far includes 30 CF patients aged 0-18 y, mean 3.54. Enrolled patients have their tissue resistance and reactance measured by the BIVA device and select patients with Bodystat\u00ae ( Figure A) at each clinic visit. These data are remotely transmitted to a smartphone, mapped on a BIVA nomogram ( Figure B ) and compared to recorded height, weight, Ins/Outs, and clinical nutritional assessment.Results: BIVA device measurements are strongly, directly correlated to the Bodystat\u00ae with R-squared values of 0.99 and 0.80 for tissue resistance and reactance respectively. In the clinic, BIVA device measurements directly correlate with height/weight measurements in that patients found to have decreased body cell mass with the BIVA device concurrently have lower weight for length/BMI percentiles and vice versa. Furthermore, BIVA device measurements correlate with nutritional status trends over successive visits. In hospitalized patients, body water changes, as indicated by Ins/Outs and clinical assesement, directly correlate with trends in BIVA device measurements.Conclusion: The BIVA device is equally accurate in comparison with Bodystat\u00ae at measuring tissue resistance and reactance. Both in the clinic and the hospital, BIVA device measurements generally correlate with the clinical assessment of nutritional status. Future directions include sending BIVA devices, home empowering patients and their parents to monitor their nutritional status from home with communication of results to their provider. Overall, use of this BIVA device, as indicated in this study, can allow for earlier, more accurate detection of nutritional deficiencies, decreased clinic visits through remote monitoring of nutritional status and improved patient outcomes.A. BIVA Device Placement: Electrodes on hand/foot between which a small current is passed to measure tissue resistance and reactance. B. BIVA Nomogram: Measurement z-scores are plotted on the x and y axis with the 50th, 75th, and 95th percentile tolerance ellipses mapped for reference. Data lying outside the 95th percentile are abnormal, specifically designated by the quadrant location. Background: More than 85% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have pancreatic insufficiency causing malabsorption that impacts body mass index (BMI) and hence pulmonary function. This necessitates supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. Some patients require proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or H2 blockers not only to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, but also to decrease gastric acidity, and optimize pancreatic enzyme activity.",

CF patients ages 2-25 years, were categorized into three groups and compared to each other. Group 1 received pancreatic enzymes only (n=19); Group 2, received enzymes plus a PPI (n=44). Group 3 received enzymes and H2 blockers (n=23). Total eligible patients n=86. The primary outcome was the mean BMI. The secondary outcome was mean FEV1.Results/Discussion: Mean BMI in Group 1 was 17.7 \u00b1 3.4 (SD), 20.1 \u00b1 11.7 (SD) in group 2, and 18.1 \u00b1 3.7 (SD) in group 3, p=0.887. Pulmonary function testing showed a mean FEV1 of 90.1 \u00b1 22.5 (SD) in group 1, 78.3 \u00b1 23.9 (SD) in group 2 and 81.7 \u00b1 28.4(SD) in group 3, p=0.454). There was no gender effect in any of the groups.Conclusion: There was no statistically significant change in mean BMI in patients on PPI or H2 blockers when compared to those only on enzyme supplements. Although the difference in mean FEV1 may be clinically significant, it did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to the small sample size. Reducing gastric acidity to achieve optimal environment for pancreatic enzymes functioning did not improve BMI or FEV1 significantly in our cohort of CF patients.",

Genetics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA; 5. Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA Background: Cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease (CFLD) is the third most common cause of death, accounting for roughly 2% of mortality (Scott-Jupp R, et al. Arch Dis Child. 1991; 66:698-701) . Out of the 30% of CF patients who are estimated to develop liver disease, 1-8% of them end up with portal hypertension and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) (Colombo C. Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2007; 13:529-36; Kobelska-Dubiel N, et al. Prz Gastroenterol. 2014; 9:136-41; Herrman U, et al. Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol. 2010; 24:585-92) . There is no diagnostic gold standard and the progression of liver disease in these patients is poorly understood. Abdominal complications have been identified using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we used a rapid and quantitative T1 MRI technique to assess hepatobiliary dilatation in patients with CF.Objective: To determine whether T1 relaxation time MRI assessments can quantitatively detect hepatobiliary dilatation in CF patients.Methods: Adult cystic fibrosis patients (5 male, 3 female; age=18-49) and healthy volunteers (4 male, 2 female; age=18-45) were recruited from the Leroy W. Matthews Cystic Fibrosis Center, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Cleveland, OH. The CF patients had a range of lung disease (FEV 1 = 45 -127%) but only one CF patient showed signs of early liver disease as evidenced by elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels. The non-CF volunteers had no known liver disease. Quantitative T1 relaxation time maps of each subject's liver were obtained using a Siemens Espree 1.5T MRI scanner. The T1 data were acquired in a single breath hold using a rapid snapshot inversion MRI technique similar to previously described methods to assess CF lung disease (Donnola SB, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2015) . Biliary dilatation was measured for each subject by manually segmenting the bile ducts (high T1 values) from the normal liver parenchyma (lower T1 values) in each imaging slice. The percent bile duct area in each imaging slice was calculated as: (Bile Duct Area / Total Liver Area) * 100%.Results: Visible increases in bile ducts were observed in the liver T1 maps for the CF patients.The mean % bile duct area for the CF patients was significantly increased in comparison to non-CF volunteers (5.8% vs 3.0%, p = 0.002). Importantly, these liver changes were observed despite all CF patients having essentially normal liver function.Conclusion: This initial study confirms that T1 MRI can quantitatively detect hepatobiliary dilatation associated with early liver disease in CF patients. These results are also consistent with previous T1 MRI results in a rat model of congenital hepatic fibrosis (Gao Y, NMR Biomed. 2016; 29:84-9) . This T1 MRI marker may provide an important assessment of CFrelated liver disease that can be used to assess liver disease progression as well as efficacy of CFTR-corrector therapies.Supported by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Introduction: Ivacaftor therapy for patients with cystic fibrosis carrying class III mutations has been demonstrated to lead to significant improvements in nutritional parameters in clinical trials and real-world clinical practice. Absorption of ivacaftor is increased by co-administration with fat-containing foods, and all patients are advised to accompany ivacaftor therapy with a high fat meal or snack. These factors could potentially alter the lipid profile of patients receiving this therapy. We therefore aimed to assess if ivacaftor therapy may influence serum cholesterol and lipid profiles in cystic fibrosis patients.Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of cholesterol measurements and lipid profiles of cystic fibrosis patients with eligible genotypes who commenced ivacaftor therapy when made clinically available in England. Serum cholesterol is routinely measured following 12 hours fasting at annual reviews for patients attending our centre. Baseline demographics at the time of commencing ivacaftor were recorded as were two lipid profiles pre and post ivacaftor commencement. If two cholesterol concentrations were available at either time period, measurements were averaged. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used as appropriate. A p value <0.05 was deemed statistically significant.Results: 30 patients had pre-and post-ivacaftor cholesterol measurements performed (18 male:12 female). Mean age was 30.5 \u00b1 9.0 years. Ivacaftor therapy was indicated for the Ser549Asn mutation in one patient with all other patients being either homozygote or heterozygote for the Gly551Asp mutation. There was a statistically significant increase in BMI at 6 months post-ivacaftor initiation (22.1 \u00b1 3.3 vs 23.0 \u00b1 3.2 kg/m 2 , p<0.001). There was no significant change in serum cholesterol measurements pre-or post-ivacaftor commencement (3.6 \u00b1 0.7 vs 3.7 \u00b1 0.6 mmol/L, p=0.479). No patients were prescribed lipid lowering therapy during the period of study. A subset of 9 patients had full lipid profiles recorded pre-and post-ivacaftor. In these subjects, ivacaftor therapy did not significantly alter serum HDL, LDL or triglyceride concentrations.Conclusions: Ivacaftor therapy leads to significant increases in nutritional parameters in cystic fibrosis patients carrying a gating mutation but does not alter serum cholesterol or lipid profiles. This finding is reassuring for the future health of this population of patients.",

Univ. of Newcastle, Sydney, NSW, Australia; 3. Univ. of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; 4. Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia Background: There is a paucity of contemporary information regarding dietary intake in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Over recent decades, significant improvements in survival and the advent of novel therapies have seen the landscape of CF transformed from a childhood disease to a chronic disease of adulthood. Comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, osteopenia and gastrointestinal cancers have become increasingly prevalent (CF Foundation 2014 Annual Report). Nutrition dogma needs to extend from nutrition for growth and survival, to nutrition for health and well-being.Objective: To provide an historical perspective of dietary intake data among children with CF from 1969 to 2016.Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted via MEDLINE and EMBASE using the following search terms: cystic fibrosis; diet records; dietary assessment; food frequency; 24-hour recall; food intake; child*; paediatric*; adolescent*. Additional articles were identified by collaboration with clinical experts and through screening bibliographies of relevant articles. Inclusion criteria for eligible articles were: English full-text, subjects aged 0-18 years, established diagnosis of CF, and dietary assessment in the absence of enteral nutrition intervention. Three independent authors simultaneously extracted relevant data using pre-established data fields: dietary methodology, energy, macro-and micro-nutrient intake, food group variety, and adherence to dietary guidelines. The collected data were crosschecked for completeness.Results: Forty-nine studies met our inclusion criteria. Overwhelmingly, dietary evaluation was confined to energy (100% of studies) with fat the predominant macronutrient measured (78% [n=38]), followed by protein and carbohydrates in 49% (n=24) and 37% (n=18) of studies, respectively. In contrast, only 11 studies (22%) assessed a limited range of micronutrients, and only one (2%) sought to appraise food group variety. Weighed food records (3-7 days) were the predominant dietary assessment methodology, accounting for 57% (n=28) of studies. Other methods included 24-hour recall (12% [n=6]), unweighed food records (22% [n=11]) and diet histories (6% [n=3]); only one study (2%) utilised a food frequency questionnaire. Over half (55%) of the studies included less than 30 subjects and only 18 (37%) used a control group. Most (76% [n=37]) of the 49 studies were conducted prior to 2000. There have only been 4 (8%) studies in the last decade. Overall, the USA contributed 41% (n=20) of publications, followed by Australia and Canada (n=8 [16%] each).Conclusion: Despite the universally recognised importance of nutritional status for CF, studies assessing nutrient intake remain sparse. Among the 49 publications since 1969, most were published over 20 years ago, during which time our food supply has changed. They are limited by small sample sizes, lack of controls, and narrow dietary evaluation. A comprehensive evaluation of dietary intake in children with CF is overdue. Food quality is a key determinant of nutrition-related chronic disease and perhaps needs to be addressed by CF care guidelines internationally. feeding product and delivery regimen. Formula cost and insurance reimbursement (12%) and institution-specific protocols including standards of practice (5%) are cited less frequently. All respondents (100%) recommend at least quarterly follow-up with the CF center including an evaluation by the registered dietitian/nutritionist for any CF patient receiving enteral feeding. . Children with CF are vulnerable to undernutrition for a variety of reasons including: increased daily nutritional needs, malabsorption/maldigestion and recurrent/chronic respiratory infections. CF guidelines state patients with BMI \u2265 50%ile have better outcomes related to their nutrition status. We conducted this study to examine the relationship between BMI and MUAC in our CF patients.",

BMI z-scores (BMIZ) were calculated against published growth curves. MUAC z-scores (MUACZ) were determined using MUAC growth curves that we developed at our institution for patients aged 2 months to 18 years using national data. Using the AND/ASPEN criteria for undernutrition, we looked at correlation and concordance between BMIZ and MUACZ stratified by malnutrition classification. Standard descriptive statistics were used to analyze data.Results: To date, 82 CF patients (56% male, average age 11 years) were enrolled. Malnutrition classification included 34 subjects with no malnutrition, 25 subjects with mild malnutrition, 16 subjects with moderate malnutrition and 7 subjects with severe malnutrition (based on the most severe malnutrition metric). BMIZ and MUACZ were highly correlated (r=0.84) and effectively discriminated between malnutrition categories (p<0.05) though MUACZ trended lower in all patients where discordance was observed (see Table) .Conclusions: In our population, MUACZ classified more CF patients as malnourished than did BMIZ based on recommended cut points. With global health studies suggesting that MUACZ is a better indicator of malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality in children than other anthropometric measures, validating the current cut points in CF patients will be important. MUAC z-score offers another tool for assessing nutritional status. Introduction: Enteral nutrition is used in 10-15% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have poor nutritional status. Without effective means to hydrolyze fat in enteral formula during delivery, fat is poorly absorbed by patients with CF and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), resulting in decreased caloric uptake and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. A novel in-line digestive enzyme cartridge (RELiZORB TM ; Alcresta Therapeutics, Inc., MA) hydrolyzes fat in enteral formula, allowing for delivery of absorbable fatty acids and monoglycerides.",

Subjects received their usual dose of pancreatic enzyme products (PEP) during both oral meals and with enteral nutrition. After a 7-day run-in period, subjects were randomized on Day 1 of a 9-day double-blind crossover period to use either an active (RELiZORB) or a placebo cartridge while receiving 500 mL of enteral formula (Impact TM Peptide, Nestle Healthcare, NJ) without PEP over 4 hours. Serial plasma samples were obtained at baseline and 1, 3, 7, 9, 12, and 24 hours after start of enteral feeding. This was repeated on Day 8 after a 7-day washout with subjects crossing over to either placebo or active cartridge. A 7-day open-label period followed, when subjects used an active cartridge with Impact Peptide at volumes of up to 1000 mL. Adverse events were recorded during all periods, along with GI symptoms during the run-in and open-label periods. Concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in plasma samples were measured using ultra high performance liquid chromatography.Results: From December 2015 through May 2016, 33 subjects (20 males) at 11 CF centers completed the study. The mean age was 14.7 years (range 5 to 34 years); 26 subjects were below 18 years of age. Mean body mass index (BMI) for subjects age 18 years and older was 19.8\u00b11.4. Mean BMI percentile for subjects less than 18 years of age will be presented. Use of the digestive enzyme cartridge (RELiZORB) was safe and well tolerated. Comparison of plasma concentrations of DHA and EPA with use of active versus placebo cartridges, as well as comparison of GI symptoms with and without the use of active cartridges, will be presented.Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. Introduction: A large proportion of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) receive pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to treat exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

A 2-h OGTT was performed at inclusion and annually during a three-year follow-up period. One-hour OGTT glucose value (G1) and 2-hour OGTT glucose value (G2) were considered. A longitudinal cluster analysis method, KmL, was used to divide patients into sub-groups of evolution of G1 and G2 glycemic profiles. Longitudinal modelling of FEV 1 linear mixed model was used to quantify the relationship between the changes of FEV 1 over time and the glycemic trajectories (GT).Results: For G1 in adults, 2 GT were observed: a stable and low GT (Group A; n = 68), and a stable and intermediary GT (Group B; n = 46). For G2 in adults, 4 GT were obtained: a stable and low GT (Group A; n = 54), a low and increasing GT (Group B; n = 33); an intermediary and decreasing GT (Group C; n = 20) and a high and increasing GT (Group D; n = 10). For G1 in children, 3 GT were observed: a stable and intermediary GT (Group A; n = 50), a stable and low GT (Group B; n = 44) and a high and increasing GT (Group C; n = 17). For G2 in children, 4 GT were observed: a stable and low GT (Group A; n = 54), an intermediary and decreasing GT (Group B; n = 34), a low increasing and decreasing GT (Group C; n = 15) and a high and stable GT (Group D; n = 8). In the adult G1 GT model, after adjustment for age and gender, the decrease of FEV1 over time was estimated at 0.85% per year (95% CI [-1.54; -0.17], p=0.01) in group A. No significant difference was observed for group B. Considering G2 GT in adults, the decrease of FEV1 over time was 0.73% per year (95% CI: [-1.44; -0.02]; p=0.04) in group A. For group D, the decrease was significantly higher (-2.1% per year (95% CI [-3.9; -0.2], p=0.03)), but not significantly different for group B and C. For G1 GT in children, FEV1 decrease was estimated at 1.1% per year (95% CI: [-2.64; 0.45]; p=0.17) in group B. The changes of FEV1 were not significantly different in the other groups. No significant change of FEV1 over time was noticed between the four GT considering G2 GT in children.Conclusion: Altered G1 glucose levels are not associated with a degradation of pulmonary function according to our data, and the question of this status remained unknown. The worsening of G2 glucose value over time seems associated with FEV 1 decline and probably justifies antidiabetic treatment.",

Introduction: Association between early glucose abnormalities (higher fasting, 1-h and 2-h glucose and insulin values during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) and worse clinical status (pulmonary function: FEV1, and nutritional: BMI) are debated. We compared clinical status and glucose tolerance in two large ongoing CF-adult observational cohorts (Montreal, Canada and Lyon, France).Methods: The main inclusion criterion in both cohorts is the absence of CF-related diabetes diagnosis. Using inclusion data in both cohorts we compared fasting glucose values (G0), 1-h (G1) and 2-h (G2) glucose values measured during OGTT with nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests.Results: 265 Canadian and 147 French patients were available. Sex ratio (45% female) and proportion of F508del homozygous (51%) patients are similar. Canadian patients are older (26.3 \u00b1 7.9 vs 24.9 \u00b1 6.7, p=0.03). Age-adjusted clinical status of the Canadian group is better with higher %FEV 1 (72.9 \u00b1 21.8 vs 62.9 \u00b1 22.1, p < 0.0001) and higher BMI (21.7 \u00b1 2.9 versus 20.1 \u00b1 2.2 kg/m 2 , p < 0.0001). The prevalence of de novo CFRD diagnosis (16.6% versus 9.2%, p = 0.01) as well as G0, G1 and G2 values were higher in the Canadian group (respectively 5.5 \u00b1 0.8 versus 4.8 \u00b1 0.5nmol/L, p < 0.0001 for G0; 11.3 \u00b1 3.1 versus 9.8 \u00b1 2.4nmol/L, p < 0.0001 for G1; 8.1 \u00b1 3.3 versus 7.1 \u00b1 2.7nmol/L, p = 0.004 for G2).Conclusion: Despite higher glucose values and incidence of de novo CFRD, the Canadian CF patients have a better pulmonary and nutritional status with higher FEV 1 and BMI compared to the French CF patients. Potential underlying factors including insulin secretion and sensitivity, modifier genes, nutritional behavior, exacerbation frequency and clinical practices play a role in these differences. Background: Reduced growth and decreased bone density are characteristics of growth and bone health in CF. Although increased risk of fractures due to osteopenia occurs in CF adults, studies demonstrate no increased fracture risk in CF children with mild to moderate lung disease. We recreated this clinical finding through bone strength analysis in the novel CF knockout rat model. Previous studies from our laboratory have established impaired linear growth, reduced bone content and lower serum IGF-I concentrations in young SD-CFTR tm1sage (Cftr-/-) rats compared to wild-type (WT) littermates (specifically in the absence of pulmonary and pancreatic confounders).",

Bone length was compared via calipers, bone mineral density was determined via microcomputed tomography (microCT), and bone strength via 3-point bending flexural test.Results: The small group of animals studied revealed a nonsignificant reduction in length of Cftr-/-female femurs (p=0.15) and tibias (p=0.07) compared to WT rats. Bone content and microarchitecture was reduced in Cftr-/-rats in both femurs (trabecular total volume, trabecular bone volume, cortical total volume, and cortical bone volume; p value <0.05 for all) and tibias (trabecular bone volume, p <0.05) compared to WT. However, no differences were found in dynamic measurements of bone strength (maximum force, maximum bending moment, deflection, stiffness or energy to max force) for either the femurs or tibias (p=ns). Ongoing studies will increase our number of animals to strengthen our results.Conclusions: Analogous to CF children demonstrating growth restriction in infancy and prior to lung dysfunction, CF rats demonstrate poor growth and reduced bone content. This conclusion is based on previous studies and data included from our ongoing experiments. Similar to the absence of increased fracture risk in CF children, the reduction in bone size and content is not accompanied by a decrease in bone strength. Additional studies into growth and bone health in CF are needed, and perhaps also considerations to how bone health is monitored in youth with CF. Our findings further support an intrinsic defect in linear growth and bone health in CF.Acknowledgements: UAB CF Animal Model Core, UAB Experimental Biomechanics Core and the UAB Small Animal Phenotyping Core, as well as funding support by DK072482.Diabetes is a significant comorbidity of cystic fibrosis (CF) and affects ~20-25% of adolescents and 40-50% of CF adults over thirty years of age. Changes in the secretion kinetics and/or magnitude of glucose responsiveness of insular-and entero-endocrine hormones often precedes the diagnosis of CF-related diabetes (CFRD). Prominent CF-associated changes include impaired pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and first phase insulin secretion. Impaired PP secretion in CF patients, following glucose challenge or a meal, has largely been dismissed as important to the development of diabetes since PP knockout mice lack a known phenotype. However, PP responses are considered a potentially useful marker of diabetes in other forms of pancreatogenic (e.g. pancreatitis-induced) diabetes mellitus. Herein, we evaluated the age of onset of PP secretion defects in CFTR-KO ferrets and very young CF human subjects following mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) and/or oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). PP responses following MMTT or OGTT were significantly reduced in 2-4 and 4-12 month old CF ferrets as compared to non-CF ferrets. Similarly, reduced PP secretion following OGTT was observed in both 0.3-3 year (p<0.001) and 3-6 year (p<0.001) old children with CF (N=39) as compared to similar age non-CF children (N=12). To evaluate whether PP secretion impacts glucose tolerance or the secretion of insular and enteroinsular axis hormones, we performed intramuscular injections of synthetic ferret PP protein in CF (N=8) and non-CF (N=8) ferrets and examined the changes in blood glucose not have the educational background and key experience working in the school environment that is often underresourced. This program is one of the current primary initiatives within our Center's CF WELL: Cystic Fibrosis Wellness, Education and Learning Laboratory, with support from the Boomer Esaison Foundation. The program has great potential to produce the empirical knowledge of what is needed to address the academic needs of students with CF and their families to ensure that students achieve according to their potential, and build skills and the confidence that they can successfully prepare for a fulfilling vocation and independent living as adults. Introduction: Depression and anxiety are common in CF. To better understand the symptoms related to both, we measured these conditions within an observational study of sputum biomarkers. The relationships between anxiety and depression with pain, dyspnea, food insecurity, and pulmonary status were explored.",

Randomization of stable patients reduced seasonal, center-specific and high-acuity-specific biases. We collected sputum and used REDCap to record clinical data at enrollment. Patients were recruited during the 1-year enrollment period. Demographics, vital signs, lung function, PHQ-8, GAD-7, pain assessment and quality of life parameters of dyspnea and food insecurity were collected at enrollment.Results: Depression is associated with anxiety (p<0.001), having dyspnea (p=0.04) and pain (p=0.01); but is not associated with FEV1% predicted (p=0.47), despite the association of FEV1% with dyspnea (p<0.001). Findings for anxiety were significantly associated in the same pattern. Anxiety is associated with depression (p<0.001), dyspnea (p<0.001), and pain (p<0.001), but not FEV1% (p=0.7). Pain is associated with depression (p=0.02) and food insecurity (p<0.01); food insecurity has 1.65 times the contribution of depression. No associations were found between pain or dyspnea and anxiety (p=0.11 and 0.65, respectively).Conclusion: Our results clearly demonstrate that depression, anxiety, dyspnea and pain cluster together. Interestingly, there is no association between this cluster and FEV1, indicating that dyspneic patients are often depressed regardless of FEV1.Supported by: CFF (LIOU13A0). Background: Untreated depression and anxiety have risks of increased morbidity for people with CF and their families. Recently published international guidelines recommend CF care teams integrate standard depression and anxiety screening (PHQ-9, GAD-7) into clinical practice. The Seattle Children's Hospital (SCH) CF Center serves 200 children from diverse geographic regions and 46.5% are publically insured. In 2007, 17% of adolescents at our center reported mood symptoms including sadness and anxiety, and nearly 15% had thoughts of suicidality or self-injury. Despite these concerns, we had not established a standard process to screen and coordinate care for mental health issues.",

Funding was awarded from CF Foundation (CFF) for support of a Mental Health Coordinator (MHC) and SCH psychiatry and psychology consultation. Two CF parents and colleagues from the SCH Department of Psychiatry joined our QI team. In monthly meetings, we reviewed algorithms and screening methods from external clinics. Parent input from the QI team and the parent advisory council recommended an electronic platform to improve adolescent engagement with tablet interfaces. Outcomes Monitoring and Analytics Platform (The OWL) is an electronic screening and tracking platform chosen to enable the team to assess behavioral health status through instant scoring and secure tracking of PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Graphs are available in real-time for the MHC to review trajectory with families and determine best avenues of care. Opportunity exists to link caregiver and child accounts and automate notifications to complete screening prior to clinic.Results: Social stigma of mental health problems was considered as a major barrier to screening initiation. Parental input recommended in-person introduction of mental health screening in CF clinic visits to normalize mental health care. A letter introducing the importance of mental health screening and the CFF parent educational handout were distributed to families. The QI team created a process map outlining screening procedures for the clinical team. MHC introduction of mental health screening began in May 2016 with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 anticipated to launch in June 2016. Algorithms will be subjected to repeated cycles of improvement. Scoring will be reviewed weekly by the MHC with psychology consultation. The screening rate and aggregate PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores will be available by October 2016.Conclusion: Although time-intensive, we have developed a mental health screening process enriched by valuable parental input and psychology collaboration that may be sustainable for the CF clinical team.",

Each patient that was identified to have ADHD/CF was age-and sex-matched to a CF-only patient based on their most recent pulmonary office visit. Each chart was then reviewed for forced expiratory volume in one second percent predicted (FEV-1%ile), body mass index (BMI) percentile, and hospitalizations for one year prior to the last pulmonary visit.Results: A total of 46 patients were identified and were included for analysis in the ADHD/CF cohort. The primary outcome of mean total hospital admissions between the ADHD/CF cohort and the CF-only cohort were different, but not statistically significant (2.22 vs 1.834, p=.467) . The difference between BMI percentile was also not statistically significant (48.634 vs 38.634, p=.135). The difference between the FEV-1%ile was statistically significant at 84.70% for the ADHD/CF group and 74.76% for the CF-only group (p=.042).Conclusion: While the difference in total hospital admissions between the ADHD/CF cohort and the CF-only cohort did not reach statistical significance, the study was underpowered. There was a significant difference between the FEV-1%ile between the two groups, interestingly in favor of the comorbid ADHD/CF population. More research is needed to further elucidate the effects of a comorbid ADHD diagnosis on outcomes in the CF pediatric population.Comparison (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2014; 69:1090-7) . Based on the prevalence and burden of depression, annual screening has been recommended by the CF Foundation and European CF Society Guidelines Committee on Mental Health (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2016; 71:26-34) . Our CF center designed and implemented a standardized process to screen depression in patients with CF and provide interventions tailored to the severity of depression.Methods: Beginning in 2013, patients with CF age \u2265 12, were assessed annually for symptoms of depression using a two-stage protocol with a two-question screen followed by a lengthier instrument to reduce the burden of applying a full diagnostic instrument to the entire CF clinic. Patients were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2; those with a score \u2265 3, were screened for additional symptoms of depression, depression severity and suicidality using the PHQ-9. Patients who screened positive for suicide risk (question 9 on the PHQ-9) where further assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Patients with a PHQ-9 score \u2265 5 or with suicide risk completed a clinical assessment. Treatment was tailored to the severity of depressive symptoms. Those with a score of 5-9 (mild) received education and support; those with a score of 10-14 (moderate) received education/support and a referral for evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP); those with a score of 15-19 (moderately depressed) received EBP and/or antidepressant therapy (SSRI); those with a score \u2265 20 (severe) received EBP and SSRI. Depression treatment outcomes were monitored using the PHQ-9, with stepped-care protocols for patients not improving.Results: During this 3-year period, there were 28 adolescents in the pediatric program and 99 adults in the adult program. 9 youth (32%) required a PHQ-9: mild (1), moderate (7) and moderately severe (1). There were 8 referrals for EBP (1 refused) and 4 patients were prescribed antidepressants. With the stepped-care protocol 44% allocated to treatment scored in the negative range on the PHQ-9, 22% had reductions in depression severity, and 33% remain in the stepped protocol. Of the adults, 21% screened positive on the PHQ-2 triggering our algorithm: negative (1), mild (9), moderate (6), moderately severe (3) and severe (2) . Of those allocated to treatment 50% scored in the negative range on PHQ-9, 35% had reductions in depression severity, and 15% remain symptomatic and continue in the stepped-care algorithm.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that depression screening and a stepped-care treatment model is a feasible and effective way to monitor and treat depressive symptoms in patients with CF and offers a framework for adolescent and adult CF programs. Background: Over the last two decades, physical health has improved significantly among people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and most manage to obtain an education, get a job and have a family of their own. However, several studies have demonstrated that many young adults with CF have mental health problems and low rates of adherence to prescribed treatments, which affects their physical health. Treatment guidelines recommend interventions to improve self-management and adherence to therapies. Interventions centered on patient self-management are focused on motivating patients to take control of their own care and make behavioral changes. We examined whether life coaching was an effective intervention to promote these goals. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a life coachingintervention in adults with CF.Methods: A randomized, controlled feasibility study was conducted. Participants were eligible to participate if they were diagnosed with CF, aged 18-30 years and had no intellectual impairment. All participants were treated at the CF center using standard of care and were randomized to either coaching or no coaching. Life coaching methods were utilized focusing on the person's daily activities, challenges and well-being. All coaching themes were chosen by the individual participant. The intervention consisted of up to 10 individual face-to-face or telephone coaching sessions with a certified coach. Primary outcome for this feasibility trial was recruitment, acceptability, adherence to the intervention and retention rates. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, adherence to treatment, self-efficacy, pulmonary function, BMI and blood glucose values.Results: Among 89 eligible participants, 40 were randomized (45% recruitment rate). Participants attended an average of 6 coaching sessions (range 1-10). Coaching was primarily face-to-face (68%) and lasted, on average 57 minutes (range 20-110 minutes), while the telephone coaching (32%) was shorter and lasted, on average 28 minutes (range 5-60 minutes). Those who dropped out (30%) did so before the 5th session. Retention rates after five and 10 coaching sessions were 60% and 45%, respectively. Reasons for drop-out were most often: a lack of need, perceived lack of efficacy, or lack of time. No significant differences between the coaching and control group were found on any of the secondary outcomes, but the sample size was not powered to find these differences.Conclusions: The recruitment rate for this study was high, indicating that individuals with CF were interested in getting assistance with managing their life with a disease. Both coaching methods (face-to-face, phone-based) were acceptable to these individuals and almost half of the participants completed all 10 coaching sessions. In contrast, the relatively high dropout rate early in the intervention is concerning. In future studies, we recommend that eligible participants are screened for their perceived need for support before inclusion in the coaching intervention.Funding: Supported by an unconditional grant by Gilead. (Sawicki GS, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2009; 8:91-6) . As a result, adherence to most CF regimens is at or below 50% for both adolescent and adult patients (Quittner AL, et al. Chest. 2014; 146:142-51) . Poor adherence is associated with negative health outcomes, such as increased morbidity and earlier mortality (Eakin MN, et al. J Cystic Fibros. 2011; 10:258-64) . This study describes the first step in the development of the Adherence Barriers Questionnaire-Cystic Fibrosis (ABQ-CF), a CF-specific, standardized measure of barriers to adherence for pediatric and adult patients.",

Audiotapes were transcribed and coded using NVivo to identify relevant themes and generate saturation grids. A separate one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine differences in the frequency of endorsement of barriers between pediatric patients and caregivers (combined to represent Pediatric Group) vs Adult Group.Results: Across participants, themes were retained if at least 50% of the Group endorsed the barrier. Themes were endorsed at the following rates (Pediatric%/Adult%): 1) Daily Habits or Routines (98%/100%), 2) Treatments (90%/93%), 3) Cost or Access (78%/79%), 4) Energy (55%/71%), 5) Social (63%/71%), 6) Vacation or Travel (88%/71%), 7) Attitudes and Beliefs (58%/64%), and 8) Mental Health (55%/50%). Results from ANO-VAs run on each theme demonstrated no statistically significant differences in endorsement between groups (F(1, 53) = 0.01 -1.93, p = 0.17 -0.94).Conclusion: The two most frequently endorsed barriers were Daily Habits and Routines (eg, time management) and Treatments (eg, side effects). Results indicated comparable endorsement between themes in the Pediatric and Adult Groups. Although not significant, a few differences at this level of coding emerged. Adults reported more energy-related barriers and the Pediatric Group reported more travel barriers. Despite similar frequencies in global themes, differences were observed within themes, indicating important distinctions between the Pediatric and Adult groups. These differences highlighted the importance of developing separate measures for pediatric patients/caregivers vs adults. Using saturation grids derived from the content analysis phase, draft versions of the ABQ-CF for the Pediatric and Adult Groups will be developed.Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

To effectively target interventions to improve adherence, comparisons between the barriers endorsed by adolescents and their caregivers should be assessed. We conducted open-ended interviews with teens and caregivers to complete the first step of instrument development for the Adherence Barriers Questionnaire-Cystic Fibrosis (ABQ-CF), and then compared the frequencies of these barriers across groups.",

Audiotapes were transcribed and coded in NVivo to identify relevant themes. A separate one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the respondents' endorsement of barriers.Results: Significant differences were found between adolescents and parents in three themes (See Table) . Nearly one-third of both adolescents (29%) and parents (31%) reported not doing treatments because of its perceived ineffectiveness, and a large majority of teens (79%) reported that sleep interfered with treatment completion, with only 38% of caregivers mentioning this. Half of pediatric patients and 42% of caregivers reported that setting up, cleaning, and maintaining equipment is burdensome and affects adherence. None of the pediatric patients reported that transitioning into adult care is an issue, but 35% of the caregivers endorsed this barrier.Conclusion: Although there was substantial agreement between both adolescents and parents on a majority of barriers, differences were also documented. Although adolescents offer a first-person account, caregivers provided valuable insight into topics adolescents do not mention, such as financial concerns. These data will be used for item generation, followed by cognitive testing and then a national psychometric validation. The goal is to utilize these measures of treatment barriers to deliver tailored interventions to improve adherence.Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.",

Emory Children's Pediatric CF Program, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA Introduction: In response to compelling data from a large international study demonstrating high prevalence of depression and anxiety in both individuals with CF and parent caregivers, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation developed recommendations for incorporating mental health screening into routine CF care. Screening is recommended for individuals with CF and parent caregivers with a child with CF age 17 or younger (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2015 : doi: 10.1136 / thoraxjnl-2015 .Aim: The focus of this abstract is the exploration of potential legal and ethical issues that may arise in pediatric institutions, when implementing the caregiver screening component of the guidelines.Method: A large pediatric CF care center's experience in implementing caregiver screening is chronicled using steps in the PLUS model for ethical decision making (Morrison E.E. (2006) . Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett.). Consideration of HIPAA law and ethical principles such as autonomy, privacy, and informed consent are explored in this context. Tips are provided for navigating these issues while advocating for implementation within healthcare institutions. Protocols and resources developed in the course of this CF care center's process of initiating caregiver screening are shared.Conclusion: Ultimately, implementation of caregiver screening requires additional efforts on the part of CF care centers in helping pediatric focused institutions understand the rationale of caregiver screening and its role in improving overall CF care management. Care centers must, 1) be ready for dialogue around legal/ ethical issues posed by their institutions, and 2) be able to creatively work toward a process of implementation that reflects patient/family centered care and remains within the scope of practice defined by their respective pediatric institutions. This negatively impacts respiratory function (Besier T, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2008 ;7:S107), health-related quality of life (Havermans T, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2008; 7:581-4) , and treatment adherence, while also increasing healthcare costs (Snell C, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2014; 49:1177-81) . We propose that brief intervention with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes SC. Behav Ther. 2004; 35:639-65) , will reduce depression and anxiety in CF patients, improving clinical outcomes including treatment adherence. ACT increases acceptance of painful emotions, thereby eliminating the need for behaviors designed to reduce or avoid anxiety and depression (eg, not taking medications to avoid thinking about having CF). ACT has proven successful in managing chronic pain (McCracken LM, et al. Eur J Pain. 2006 ;10:23-9), smoking (Gifford EV, et al. Behav Ther. 2004; 35:689-705) , and substance use (Hayes SC, et al.

Sessions encouraged patients to move toward their core values, despite barriers such as anxiety, depression and illness exacerbation. Participants completed psychometric measures of depression (PHQ9), anxiety (GAD-7), quality of life (CFQR), treatment adherence, coping skills, and others at baseline, after 3 weeks and 6 weeks of ACT, and 3 months later.Results: A total of 60 patients completed the initial screening questionnaires. Anxiety and depression were endorsed by 46.3% and 44.4% on these initial questionnaires. Of these patients, 7 subjects (11.7%) opted to participate in ACT: 42.9% in person, and 57.1% via telehealth. To date, 4 subjects have completed 3 sessions, and 2 patients have completed all 6 sessions of ACT. Anxiety decreased in 100% and depression decreased in 86% of participants. All patients who received 1 session of ACT were retained to complete all scheduled sessions. There were no significant differences in outcomes between telehealth and in-person participants.Conclusions: ACT is well-received by patients with CF, in person and via telehealth, improving ability to cope with anxiety and depression, thereby accepting and managing CF more effectively.Supported by CFF. Introduction: Few studies exist investigating the attentional neurocognitive state of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), especially those in the pediatric population. Chronic disruptions in normal sleep patterns have been linked with poor neurocognitive performance as well as deficits in memory, learning, and overall intellectual activity (1, 2, 3) . It is important to recognize and identify these coexisting consequences of sleep-disordered breathing so they may be addressed in the management of pediatric CF patients.",

Data collection took place from July 2015 through January 2016. Sleep quality was assessed using the Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (SDSC). Attentional capacity was assessed using the Short Form of Conners Parent Rating Scales-Revised (CPRS-R:S) (4). Lung function was represented using FEV1%, which was obtained from pulmonary function tests performed during the patient's visit as standard of care. Pearson correlations (\u03b1 = .05) were calculated for the following variables: 1. Sleep disturbances and attentional capacity; 2. Sleep disturbances and lung function; 3. Attentional capacity and lung function. Conclusions: Significant correlations were noted among daytime attention capacity, lung function, and sleep disturbances in pediatric CF patients, implicating possible associations between these variables. A positive significant correlation between Sleep-Wake Transition Disorders and both Hyperactivity and Oppositional behavior provides support for the potential influence of sleep-wake state organization on neurocognitive development and organization. Gender differences in Executive Function implicate possible variances in brain development between boys and girls, resulting in differing ADHD-related symptoms and clinical presentation. Further research needs to be done in this area to improve understanding of the consequences of sleep disturbances secondary to CF pulmonary complications on daytime neurocognitive function. ",

Our objective was to build upon a recent study conducted at Cork University Hospital/University College Cork (CUH/UCC) in Ireland to evaluate the impact of ivacaftor on patient-reported chest physiotherapy practices, and self-reported adherence to chronic therapies.Methods: Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) partnered with CUH/ UCC to adapt an existing retrospective questionnaire designed by the CUH/ UCC team for use in the US. The cross-sectional web-based survey is administered to patients and parents of children with CF at a single US CF care center electronically via REDCap. Measures include patient-reported physical therapy practices, nutritional habits, and self-reported adherence to chronic therapies before and after the start of ivacaftor therapy. Eligible participants are asked to complete the survey during clinic visits or by email survey link. For children under the age of 14, parents are asked to complete the survey on their child's behalf.Results: To date, 16 participants (of 42 eligible at the site) have completed the survey (6 female). Mean age of participants is 28.3 years, ranging from 8-61 years old, with 2 participants under the age 14. Participants' mean score on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scales is 0.94, indicating overall \"medium adherence\" reported by the current sample. Average duration of treatment of ivacaftor is 45.7 months, and 9 (56.2%) participants participated in clinical trials involving ivacaftor ahead of FDA approval in 2012. Of the collected patient-reported data to date, 8 (53%) report an easier time coughing up sputum, 6 (38%) report looser sputum, and 14 (89%) report coughing less overall since beginning ivacaftor. Seven (44%) participants report finding exercise easier to complete since starting ivacaftor. Six (38%) reported not regularly performing airway clearance therapy (ACT) since starting ivacaftor, an increase from the 3 (18.8%) who reported not regularly performing ACT prior to starting therapy.Conclusions: Preliminary data suggest that participants report improved respiratory health and reduced participation in airway clearance therapy. Implementation of the study is ongoing and upon the completion of data collection, analysis will be done to explore how self-reported CF patient nutritional regimens and adherence to chronic therapies has been impacted by the introduction of ivacaftor therapy. It is expected that the international collaboration will provide a more complete analysis of the impact of CFTR modulator therapy on adherence to physical therapy and airway clearance practices and medications.",

            "text": "Objective: Management of cystic fibrosis (CF) requires numerous treatments (eg, airway clearance, pancreatic enzymes) to slow disease progression and improve quality of life. In families, parents and youth often share responsibility for managing these tasks. The Family Responsibility for CF Care is a new questionnaire designed to assess the division of regimen responsibility within families of youth with CF. To begin establishing its psychometric foundation, the objective of the study was to examine its factor structure.Methods: Our sample included 93 patients with CF (M age : 15.2 years; Range = 11 -20 years; 50.5% male) and their primary caregivers (78.5% mothers). Patients and their primary caregivers independently completed the Family Responsibility for CF Care. A principal components analysis was conducted each with parent-and youth-report versions.Results: Three factors, accounting for 72.6% of the variance in caregiver-reported responsibility, were identified: diet-related tasks and oral medications, respiratory treatments, and logistical tasks. The internal consistency of these scales ranged from adequate for logistical tasks (\u03b1 = .71) to excellent for respiratory treatments and diet-related tasks and oral medications (\u03b1 = .90 and .91, respectively). For youth-reported responsibility, two factors explained 62.8% of the variance: treatment tasks and logistical tasks. Internal consistency was adequate for logistical tasks (\u03b1 = .78) and excellent for treatment tasks (\u03b1 = .93).Conclusions: Our results indicate that somewhat different, yet logical, dimensions comprise youth-and parent-reported division of responsibility for disease management. Specifically, parent and youth versions of the Family Responsibility for CF Care have similar factor structures; however, they differ slightly in that parent-report of responsibility is more specified for treatment tasks (ie, divided into respiratory vs diet and oral medications). Future directions include examining other psychometric properties of this questionnaire. were then focused on formalizing compliance across recommendations, as well as implementing guideline #4, which recommended annual screening for depression and anxiety with the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 for adults with CF.",

            "text": "Methods: The adult social workers attempted to screen all patients with the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 as an integrated part of the annual psychosocial assessment, beginning in February 2015. In addition, the adult social workers developed a Depression or Anxiety Adult Response Protocol adapted from the Screening and Treatment for Depression and Anxiety Algorithm for Individuals With CF. Per protocol, patients with minimal symptoms of anxiety or depression are rescreened at next annual appointment. Patients with positive screens are provided with interventions including clinical assessment, brief counseling and psychoeducation, referral for psychotherapy and/or psychiatric intervention and discussion with clinic physician about prescription of SSRI, depending on severity of score/symptoms. Patients with positive screens are also rescreened at follow-up clinic visits. The adult social workers also created a Suicidal Ideation Adult Response Protocol to utilize for patients with PHQ-9 scores in \"moderate-severe\" range, who mark \"2-3\" on Question 9 of the PHQ-9 or present to clinic with suicidal ideation. All protocols and interventions were developed based on the 2014 recommendations from the CFF/ECF GCMH in CF. All screening results and subsequent actions are entered into the EMR.Results: Between 2/1/15-1/31/16, of the 241 adult CF patients with at least one clinic visit, 97% (234) were offered screening, with 89% (215) successfully completing mental health screening. See Table for full results.Conclusion: The majority of patients seen at the MN CF Center were willing to participate in mental health screening (92%). Of those screened, almost one-quarter of patients screened positive for mild-severe symptoms of anxiety (24%) and depression (21%). Social workers estimate screening had minimal impact on length of clinic visits and took between 5-15 minutes. Additional time was required for discussion, interventions and referrals as needed.References : Pediatric patients with chronic diseases may follow with one clinic or provider for upwards of 20 years before transferring to adult care. Standard of comprehensive cystic fibrosis (CF) care recommends that transition discussions begin early in treatment and continue until transfer. Adult providers expect that their patients are adept at treatment and have greater ability to manage their care than pediatric patients would; however not all patients have sufficient self-care skills by the time they transfer to adult care. The objective of this project was to examine patient reported self-care skills in two groups: transition-age patients in a pediatric clinic and posttransfer patients in adult care. Additionally, this project identified areas for improvement in skills education in transition-age patients.Methods: A \"Self Care Skills Worksheet\" was adapted from existing tools (Wood D, et al. Acad Pediatr. 2014; 14:415. Reiss JG, et al. Pediatrics. 2005; 115:112. Sawicki GS, et al. J Pediatr Psychol. 2011; 36:160) . The measure included 8 categories of self care (Prescriptions, Equipment, Appointments/Check-Ups, Airway Clearance, Insurance and Finances, Personal Health, During Your Appointment, Personal Life). Patients indicated ability to complete skills and responses were given a numerical score: I always do this (4 points), I am learning to do this (3), I don't know how to do this, but I want to learn (2) , I don't know how to do this (1), I don't need to do this (0). The worksheet was administered June-August 2015 to patients ages 14-25 in the pediatric and adult centers. A median [interquartile range] score for each skill was compared between patients in pediatric vs adult care. A p-value of 0.05 was utilized to determine significance.",

Pediatric patients had a significantly lower median Prescription (2.1 [1.4, 2.9 ] vs 3.6 [3.0, 3.9]), Equipment (1.9 [0.7, 3 .0] vs 3.3 [2.6, 4 .0]), Appointments/Check-Ups (1.8 [1.3, 2.9 ] vs 3.8 [3.3, 4 .0]), and During Your Appointment (2.7 [2.5, 3.4] vs 3.6 [3.4, 4.0] ) scores compared to adult patients (all differences significant at p < .05). There was a trend toward lower median Insurance score in both cohorts (1.5 [0, 2.5] vs 2.8 [2.0, 3.3) , p=0.08). There was no difference in Airway Clearance (4.0 [3.3, 4 .0] vs 4.0 [3.5, 4 .0]), Personal Health (2.0 [1.4, 3.6 ] vs 2.2 [2.0, 2.9] ) and Personal Life (2.0 [0.9, 2.8] vs 2.5 [2.0, 2.9] ) scores between pediatrics and adults.Conclusion: Adult patients reported more confidence in managing prescriptions, equipment, and appointments. Though anticipated to score higher in all categories, patients in adult care did not report stronger ability in the core components of CF care in airway clearance, personal life and health. Both pediatric and adult patients were less confident in the insurance category. Future directions include: Identifying factors that contribute to successful transition to adult care, enhanced transition education in pediatric care, and retrospective skills building in recently transitioned adults. Further study is needed to determine if standardized, targeted skills building and tracking leads to successful transitions. Prior research has shown that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with low or moderate adherence to pulmonary medications are more likely to have higher rates of hospitalizations and higher healthcare costs. Pharmacy-based comprehensive therapy management interventions have been developed in CF, and research is needed to better understand the impact of such interventions on adherence. In May 2014, Walgreens implemented the Connected Care \u00ae Cystic Fibrosis (CC-CF) clinical patient management program aimed at improving medication adherence.",

Medication adherence was measured by proportion of days covered (PDC). The sample consisted of CF patients aged 6+ who had \u22651 pharmacy claim for inhaled tobramycin, inhaled aztreonam, ivacaftor, or dornase alfa from 6/1/2014-5/31/2015, and medical claims with \u22652 CF diagnoses \u226530 days apart. Other inclusion criteria were evidence of health care services and continuous health plan enrollment with medical and pharmacy coverage. Dependent variables included 12-month medication adherence, healthcare utilization (e.g., hospitalizations), clinical outcomes (e.g., exacerbations), and total medical and pharmacy costs. Adjusting for variables that remained significant after matching, two sets of models (generalized linear and logistic regression models) were estimated to assess differences on the outcomes between the intervention and control groups.Results: The combined dataset contained 369 intervention patients and 740 control patients meeting selection criteria, of which 233 were propensity-matched from each cohort. At 12-month post-index, Walgreens CC-CF patients who were prescribed inhaled tobramycin were adherent to the medication 1.2 times more often than those in the non-Walgreens cohort (N=168; IRR=1.203, 95% CI [1.045,1.385]) but not for other therapies studied. Walgreens CC-CF patients had lower 12-month post-index hospitalization (p<.03) and ER rates (p<.01) compared to matched controls (adjusted means of 0.47 vs. 0.69 for hospitalization; 0.93 vs. 1.73 for ER visits). The rate of hospitalizations with IV antibiotics was lower among the intervention group but was not statistically significant (OR=0.736 [0.427, 1.268] ). Other outcomes were not significantly different between cohorts at 12 months.Discussion: A pharmacy-based therapy management program for CF patients was associated with higher adherence to inhaled tobramycin and lower ER and hospitalization rates. Future studies should examine what components of such programs are most effective to improve adherence and related outcomes.Funded by Walgreen Co. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a standard measure of general well-being in pediatric chronic health populations. Research suggests under conditions of severe illness or impairment parents may need to respond as a proxy for their child. Previous research in chronic illness shows consistent discrepancies in parent-proxy and child self-report of general HRQOL; however these studies typically do not include patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Further, minimal research exists related to respondent discrepancies impacting important construct domains, specifically treatment burden (TB) and family functioning, both of which have significant impact on the well-being of children with CF. This study explored differences in parent-proxy and child self-reports of HRQOL, family functioning, and TB within a pediatric CF population.",

            "text": "Methods: Parents and children in a multidisciplinary CF clinic were recruited to complete self-report measures. General HRQOL was assessed using the PedsQL\u2122 Version 4.0 Short Form Generic Core Scales (PedsQL\u2122 4.0 SF15). Family functioning was assessed via self-and parent-report on the Family Assessment Device (FAD). TB was measured through a subscale on age-appropriate versions of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R).Results: Independent sample t-tests were conducted to examine differences between parent-proxy and child self-report ratings. Significant differences were found on the PedsQL\u2122 SF15 psychosocial subscale, t(95) =0.814, p=0.015, d=0.50 , and the total score t(95) =2.13, p=0.034, d=0.46 . Results indicated that parents (psychosocial: M=66.21, SD=12.07; total score: M=67.74, SD=18.36) under-reported HRQOL compared to child self-report (psychosocial: M=75.07, SD=16.07; total score: M=74.83, SD=14.14). Results from the FAD show significant differences on affective responsiveness, t(90) =2.29, p=0.024, d=0.48, and behavioral control, t(90)=2.08, p=0.041, d=0.42 . Results found that parents reported healthier functioning (affective responsiveness: M=1.74, SD=0.34; behavioral control: M=1.63, SD=0.29) than their children (affective responsiveness: M=1.94, SD=0.48; behavioral control: M=1.77, SD=0.37) . No significant differences were seen on other FAD subscales, on the general functioning domain of the FAD or on the TB subscale of the CFQ-R.Conclusions: Previous research in pediatric chronic health populations has demonstrated differences in child self-report and parent-proxy report. This is the first study to examine respondent differences on the PedsQL\u2122 SF15 for pediatric CF. Results suggest that similar to other pediatric chronic illnesses, parents of children with CF tend to under-report HRQOL for their children in the psychosocial domain and overall scores. While differences were seen on parents' perceptions of their affective involvement and control of their child's behavior, their report across the majority of FAD subscales and the general functioning domain was consistent with their child's report. Further, parents and children reported similar perceptions of TB for the child with CF. Findings suggest that while using parent-proxy report may be reliable and meaningful in some domains, there are certain constructs where their report may differ significantly from their child.",

Psychiatry, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA Introduction: Parent caregivers of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) have higher rates of depression than the general population, which in turn is associated with elevated symptoms of depression in adolescents with CF (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2014; 69:1090-7) and negative health outcomes (Barker DH, et al. Pediatrics 2016; 137:e20152296) . As a result, the International Committee on Mental Health in CF recommends routine screening for depression in parent caregivers of children with CF ages 0-17 using one of three approaches depending on staffing and resources: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, the PHQ-8 or the ultra-brief PHQ-2 (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2016; 71:26-34) . For parental depression screening concerns have been raised about acceptability to parents and the added load on busy CF center (CFC) visits. As part of a quality improvement project, we sought parent/caregiver feedback on screening and intervention for parental depression.Methods: Annual parental depression screening at CFC visits for children with CF 0-17 years began in 2014 using the PHQ-2 for a streamlined process. Due to low rates of caregiver depression observed in 2014 compared to a large international study, in 2015, screening was given with the PHQ -9 for half of the parents (last names A-L) and the PHQ-2 for the other half (M-Z). A standardized intervention protocol was used based on severity scores. Using a phone satisfaction survey, feedback on acceptability was obtained from a sample of 15 parents who completed the PHQ-9 and 11 parents who completed the PHQ-2.Results: Twenty-six parents (73% female) responded to the phone survey; 62% agreed and 38% were neutral that the CFC should be responsible for identifying, treating and referring (IT&R) for adolescent/adult CF patient depression; 50% agreed, 38% were neutral, and 12% disagreed the CFC should be responsible for IT&R for parental depression. Comparing PHQ-2 vs PHQ-9 respondents, PHQ-9 screening was thought to be more helpful. Parents were also surveyed about the content of the PHQ-9 and no one felt the questions were confusing, too private, or too embarrassing to answer, including the item assessing suicide risk. All those surveyed with the PHQ-9 felt the screening process was efficient, easy and did not take up too much time; 93% felt completing the PHQ-9 and having it discussed with them did not disrupt the flow of the clinic visit. These rates are similar to the shorter PHQ-2 data where 100% agreed or strongly agreed the process was efficient, did not take too much of their time and did not disrupt the flow of the clinic. While 93% of PHQ-9 parents felt the clinic was a suitable place to answer the questions, 87% did not want the results reviewed with their child present.Conclusions: We conclude that annual screening with the PHQ-9 is acceptable to parents, perceived as efficient as the shorter PHQ-2 and does not add unnecessary time to the CF center visit. Parents felt strongly about maintaining privacy when addressing their screening results.Buffalo Arch Intern Med. 2006; 166:1749-55) . This study did not report caregiver concerns for their own sleep, and associations with sleep problems in their children with CF were not assessed. CF WELL was recently established at Cincinnati Children's Hospital to improve wellness in families affected by CF. Better understanding of sleep in caregivers and CF patients has been prioritized as a short-term program objective. Longer-term goals include development of targeted interventions to improve CF family wellness through improved sleep outcomes.Objective: Describe frequencies and correlates of sleep problems in caregivers of children with CF.Methods: Primary caregivers (n=73; 92% self-identified as mothers or grandmothers) completed a brief 8-item scale developed to assess caregiver concern for sleep problems, hallmark features of insomnia, symptoms of sleep disordered breathing, daytime sleepiness, and sleep duration. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) was consulted on this study; informed consent for human subject research was waived. Data were collected from January-April 2016.Results: Most parents reported inadequate sleep duration. Forty-two percent expressed interest in working on sleep issues. Daytime sleepiness was experienced at least 2-3 times per week by the majority of parents. Spearman rank-order correlations were conducted to examine associations between caregiver endorsement of concerns for their own sleep and 1) child age and 2) endorsement of sleep concerns for their child. Two-tailed tests of significance indicated significant positive relationships (r s (73)=.267, p=.022 and r s (73)=.390, p=.001, respectively). Parents of 6-12 year old children with CF reported the highest level of concern for their own sleep, followed by parents of teens. Interestingly, parents of children less than 5 years of age reported the least concern about their own sleep.Conclusion: Insufficient sleep and daytime sleepiness are common concerns for parents of CF patient and may interfere with family functioning and care of the CF child. Thus, there is a need to identify CF caregiver sleep concerns and provide individualized interventions to optimize sleep. These preliminary data should be confirmed with a larger sample of CF families. Future studies will employ more in-depth measures of sleep.",

            "text": "Tirabassi-Mathis, L. Nursing, Miller Children's and Women's Hospital Long Beach, Long Beach, CA, USA Background: The Hispanic population, the fastest growing minority in the US, represents a minority in the cystic fibrosis (CF) community (retrieved from https://www.census.gov/topics/population/hispanic-origin. html). Literature describes that Hispanics with CF have greater risk factors influencing morbidity and mortality (Schechter MS. Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2011; 17:448-54; Watts KD, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2009; 44:594-601) . Concomitantly, newborn screening for CF is currently included in nationwide mandated screening programs (CFF.org). Thus, more Hispanic infants diagnosed with CF are anticipated, even though they have reduced CF carrier rates compared to their Euro-American counterparts. Publications from the US on CF in the Hispanic population exist relative to epidemiology and genetics; however, no US publications exploring perspectives of Hispanic experiences living with CF exist.Objective: This study explored parenting children with CF, health beliefs, and health care experiences through the lens of Latina mothers.Methodology: Narrative inquiry was the qualitative method employed (Riessman C, 2008). Ten interviews with Latina mothers were conducted, 50% spoke English.Analysis: Structural and thematic analyses were applied with critical social and feminist theory as sensitizing frameworks (Campbell BC, Bunting S. ANS Adv Nurs Sci. 1991;13:1-15). The major themes identified were mothering, growing and growth, mother talk, connected, and being here with subthemes. Ruddick's maternal thinking framework (1995) guided the analysis.Findings: Maternal experiences of parenting a child with CF were consistent with existing studies from the dominant Euro-American culture except the following noted differences. Mothering was expressed as protective maternal knowing from their stories described during the period of their child's diagnosis. Mothers also expressed concern about their spouses' resistance (machismo) to talking about their child's CF. Tensions with extended family and their attempts to influence health beliefs were described. Interpreter use decreased as the child's age increased. The majority of mothers reported using teas as a medicinal measure in conjunction with prescribed CF care. Mothers relied on the CF center as their primary source for CF information. Mothers acknowledged an underrepresentation of CF within the larger CF community and lack of awareness of CF in their Hispanic community. They expressed a desire to see a shift from the stereotyped Caucasian images of CF toward greater representation of Hispanic people in order to promote awareness in Hispanic communities and with health care providers.Implications: 1. Valuing maternal thinking was called out as a tribute to a caregivers' capacity to care for their children; 2. Strengthening psychosocial support for the work of mothering merits greater recognition; 3. Gaining CF insight to deliver patient/family centered care that is culturally and gender sensitive; 4. Reinforcing and informing the ability of health care providers to individualize care of nondominant Euro-American children and families with CF by applying research findings that illuminate perceived care differences in the health care settings. Hispanic mothers need a voice in the CF community. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex autosomal recessive disease that leads to chronic disorders in many systems in the body, mainly the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The treatment for CF is very complex and can include a variety of therapies, all of which can take up to 3.5 hours per day, leading to a generally poor adherence rate. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in children and causes impairment in executive functioning leading to a variety of difficulties with daily tasks. There is a paucity of research on the effect that ADHD impairments have on CF treatment adherence. Our two-part study aims to illustrate the prevalence of ADHD in the pediatric CF population at Nemours Children's Hospital and then investigate the implications that comorbidity has on CF outcomes.",

Charts were reviewed for biological sex, location of pulmonology clinic visit, and race.Results: The prevalence of ADHD in the study CF population was 8.3%. The male to female ratio in CF-only cohort was almost 1:1. In the ADHD/CF cohort, 75% were male and 25% were female, which was statistically significant compared to the CF-only cohort.Conclusions: The prevalence of ADHD in the CF population is comparable to the prevalence in the general population. Males were more likely to have an ADHD diagnosis as compared to females, which mirrors literature on the demographics of ADHD. Further research is warranted to explore whether or not an ADHD diagnosis will decrease treatment adherence leading to decreased lung function and increased disease exacerbations and hospitalizations.worsened, discussions were made on how to treat further. The parents, with the guidance of the team, made the determination to neither intubate nor to use heroic measures to extend her life. She initially continued with Bi-PAP, chest physiotherapy and nebulizer treatments but after a discussion with a respiratory therapist who told the patient that she could decide how and even whether to continue treatments (unknown to the team, including parents), the patient began to refuse all interventions. Her saturations then dropped and she become unresponsive several hours later and expired.The patient had a recent admission four months before this admission in which her status was changed from \"terminal cystic fibrosis\" to \"treatable\" CF, per the pulmonologist's recommendations. During her second-last inpatient stay, the treatment team referred her to the Hospital Ethics Committee (HEC) based on the patient's wish to discontinue treatments and on whether she was being adequately managed at home. Ultimately despite the patient's having some autonomy of care, a fourteen-year-old cannot legally make decisions about his/her medical care on his/her own unless the child has medical emancipation, which this patient did not have. This brings up an ethical consideration: when, how, to what degree, and under what circumstances should a child be allowed to make a terminal decision?",

Children's of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, USA Introduction: Many negative adjustment problems have been reported in siblings of children with chronic illness. For siblings of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) specifically, negative outcomes include increased risk for feelings of loneliness and isolation, anxiety, depression, vulnerability, anger, worry about their ill sibling, difficulties in school, withdrawal and shyness, somatic complaints, low self-esteem, and both internalizing and externalizing behavior difficulties (Williams PD, et al. J Soc Pediatr Nurs. 1997; 2:127-37) . Sleep disturbances have been associated with increases in externalizing and internalizing behaviors, child-reported depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Children who have poor sleep habits are reported to have more difficulties with attention and school-related difficulties. Poor sleep in children has also been associated with lower self-esteem and difficulties socializing. Children who experience fear or worry often have difficulties falling asleep. Despite the overlap between negative adjustment problems in siblings and problems associated with sleep disturbances, no research currently exists looking specifically at sleep in the sibling population. The objective of the current study was to examine the sleep habits of children with siblings hospitalized for treatment of cystic fibrosis.Methods: Siblings of children with CF between the ages of 4-17 wore an actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) for the duration of the hospitalization of their sibling as an objective measure of sleep quality.Results: Well-siblings averaged 457.05 (S.D. 70.06) minutes of sleep a night during the hospitalization of their sibling with CF. On average, it took 6.70 (S.D. 2.05) minutes to fall asleep (sleep onset latency), and well-siblings were awake for an average of 35.31 (S.D. 20.77) minutes after falling asleep (wake after sleep onset).Conclusion:The National Sleep Foundation released updated sleep recommendations in March 2015. Based on these recommendations, preschoolers (3-5 years) should sleep between 10-13 hours a night, schoolaged children (6-13 years) should sleep between 9-11 hours a night, and teenagers (14-17 years) should sleep between 8-10 hours a night. The current study indicates that during the hospitalization of a sibling with cystic fibrosis, their well-siblings are sleeping on average 7.6 hours a night, which falls below the recommended amount of sleep for all represented age ranges. Further, well-siblings were quick to fall asleep during the hospitalization, as indicated by their sleep onset latency. This indicates a pattern of sleep deprivation in this population. Future research is needed to assess the relationship between sleep deficits and negative outcomes in siblings of children with cystic fibrosis.",

Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA Background: Consistent with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation and European CF Society International Guidelines on Depression and Anxiety in CF, parent mental health screening was implemented in our center in April 2016. Quality improvement (QI) methodology was used to develop a protocol to best meet the needs of our families. This QI initiative elicits parent feedback on the acceptability of mental health screening.Objective: To quantitatively measure acceptability of routine parent mental health screening integrated within pediatric CF care.Methods: Parents of children diagnosed with CF were approached during a routine clinic appointment. One parent from each family was asked to complete the PHQ9, GAD7, and Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT). Parents also completed the Acceptance Questionnaire (AQ), and these responses were separated and batched for confidentiality. The PHQ9 and GAD7 are standardized screeners of depression and anxiety recommended by the International Guidelines. The PAT is a measure of family psychosocial risk normed on parents of children with chronic illness. In addition to parent mental health, it screens patient and sibling mental health and family stressors. The AQ included 6 questions rated on a 1-5 Likert scale about the ease, length, importance, comfort, helpfulness, and whether to continue questionnaires. Results of questionnaires were reviewed with parents and follow-up was provided consistent with International Guidelines.Results: To date, 20 families have been approached with screening ongoing. Four families did not complete screening due to: lack of time, concern about results being used in a child custody dispute, and feeling the information was unnecessary. The 16 respondents were primarily mothers (81%) of 9 boys and 7 girls who were 82% non-Hispanic, Caucasian aged [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] SD= 4.3) . Elevated PHQ9 and GAD7 scores were reported for 19% of parents, and elevated PAT scores were reported for 31% of families. Concordance (Cohen's kappa) between the PHQ9 and GAD7 was 1.00 and 0.67 between the PHQ9/GAD7 and PAT. PAT scores were elevated in an additional two families not identified by the PHQ9/GAD7. Subscale score review found that child psychosocial concerns and poor family social support accounted for the two additional elevations. Parents generally rated all questionnaires as acceptable with PHQ9/GAD7 mean ratings between 4.06-4.67 and PAT mean ratings between 3.94-4.50. Lowest ratings were for length of time and highest ratings were for comfort with answering questions. Mean total acceptability ratings for the PHQ9/GAD7 (M= 26.27, SD= 2.71) were higher than for the PAT (M= 25.25, SD= 2.82), but the difference was not statistically significant.Discussion: Preliminary results suggest that parents find mental health screening acceptable when integrated within routine pediatric CF care. However, 20% declined screening, which may have caused a self-selection bias. Parents rated the PHQ9/GAD7 as slightly more acceptable that the PAT; however, the PAT identified psychosocial concerns in two families that would not have been identified otherwise. Initial results suggest that broader screening may be beneficial, but parent preferences should be considered before adding additional measures.Supported by the CF Foundation Award for a Mental Health Coordinator.

            "text": "Aim: To evaluate the relationship between demographic, clinical characteristics and HRQoL in patients with cystic fibrosis.Methods: Cross-sectional study, included 66 adolescent and adult patients with confirmed diagnoses of CF. Data on pulmonary exacerbations in the preceding 9-month period, demographic, clinical and quality of life characteristics were collected at the time of enrolment. Quality of life was valued using the the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised (CFQ-R) that measures the impact of health, daily life, perceived well-being and symptoms. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range; comparisons were made using the two-sample independent t-test or the Mann-Whitney test; Spearman correlation was used; all statistical tests were two-sided, and significance was reported at p < 0.05.Results: The study involved 66 patients, of which 37 (56.1%) were female and 29 (43.9%) male; 28 (42.4%) were white and 38 (57.6%) were not white. A correlation with was found between clinical and sociodemographic variables and CFQ-R domains with p value <0.05 as age of diagnosis, family income, body mass index, FEV 1 %, number of exacerbations and hospitalizations in the last year, Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures in the last year and Shwachman-Kulczycki score.Conclusion (Naqvi SK, et al. Sleep Breath. 2008; 12:77-83) and sleep difficulties are associated with disease morbidity and decreased lung functioning (Amin R, et al. Chest. 2005; 128(3) :1357-63). National guidelines call for 9-11 hours of sleep per night for school-aged children, and 7-9 hours of sleep for adults (26-64 years) (Hirshkowitz M. Sleep Health. 2015; 1(1):40-3) . Inadequate sleep is linked to a multitude of negative outcomes, including behavior problems and decreased overall quality of life (Lavigne JV, et al. J Dev Behav Pediatr. 1999; 20:164-9; Sadeh A, et al. Child Dev. 2002; 73:405-17) . Sleep disruption also has deleterious effects on metabolic function (Van Cauter E, et al. Sleep Medicine. 2008; 9(1) :S23-8), which may be especially problematic for children diagnosed with CF. The aim of this study is to describe the sleep of children with CF and their caregivers in comparison to national recommendations.Methods: Youth aged 4-12 (M = 7.75, SD = 3.10) and a caregiver (N = 8) wore wrist Actigraph monitors for seven consecutive days. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and number and duration of nocturnal awakenings were used to measure child and parent sleep. All values were averaged over the course of seven days and nights.Results: Children slept an average of 7 hours and 23 minutes per night and had an average SE of 74.83%. They awoke an average of 24 times per night, with these awakenings lasting an average of 4 minutes. Parents slept an average of 6 hours and 25 minutes per night with an average SE of 81.67%. They awoke an average of 17 times, with these awakenings lasting an average of 5 minutes. See Table for 1 1. Cystic Fibrosis Clinic, Island Health, Victoria, BC, Canada; 2. Cystic Fibrosis Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada Background: The length of time spent at clinic visits is a burden for the cystic fibrosis patient. From annual visits, which can last up to three hours, to regular diagnostic testing, individuals spend a significant amount of time in the clinical setting. These obligations to sustain health can have a significant impact on maintaining other important life goals, and decrease the patient's satisfaction with the clinic experience.Objective: Through Cystic Fibrosis Canada's Quality Improvement Learning and Leadership Collaborative, we aim to decrease the amount of time our patients spend waiting to see professionals during annual clinic visits. Through this process, the overall amount of time our patients spend in clinic should also be reduced, which should also lead to an increase in patient satisfaction.Methods: When examining a traditional individual interview model for the clinic visit, we found that in many cases, patients were waiting a total of 45 minutes or more between providers and allied health professionals. This suggested that in some cases, these delays led to lengthy clinic visits. We surmised that by adjusting the clinic model from an individual interview model to a team interview format (provider and allied health visit the patient together); we would be able to decrease the wait time for the patient. This in turn, would decrease total time for the clinic visit, and would reduce an identified burden for the patient.To achieve this aim, clinics were divided between two providers. One provider maintained the traditional individual interview model, while the other provider conducted clinic in the team interview model. Team interview model patients were booked for an appointment time, whereas traditional model patients were booked for a clinic \"start time.\" Patient time in clinic was measured with a timer, started when patient arrives at clinic and stopped when the patient leaves. Professionals recorded time on timer when entering and exiting patient's room. At the conclusion of the team model, patient satisfaction was measured with a written survey.Results: After 12 clinics over a period of four months, we saw a significant decrease in both average patient wait time (79%) and average total time spent in clinic (51%) using the team interview model compared to the traditional individual interview model. Additionally, survey results showed a patient preference for the team model approach (77% strongly agree/ agree). A verbal staff survey also found that 86% were in favour of the new team interview model of care.Conclusion: Modification of care delivery to a team interview model has demonstrated a significant decrease in patient wait times and total time in clinic. This method has also demonstrated increased patient and staff satisfaction with the clinic experience.formalized transition program among CF centers, but will also help guide transplant transition research development among individuals with CF.",

Sheffield Adult CF Centre, Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, United Kingdom; 2. The Sheffield Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, United Kingdom; 3. ScHARR, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, United Kingdom Introduction: The setup of CFRD care for adults with CF in Sheffield was changed in April 2014, with the introduction of monthly joint consultant-led CFRD clinics, support by a diabetes specialist nurse (DSN), and a CF specialist nurse coordinating CFRD care and screening. Patients also receive interim appointments or telephone/text message support as required from the DSN. There is better communication between CF and diabetes teams and the need for insulin adjustments/regimen change is recognised more promptly. This is a before and after comparison to explore the impact of this new CFRD care setup.Methods: A retrospective review of all the HbA1c levels (normal range 19-48mmol/mol) for adults with CFRD in Sheffield since November 2013 was performed. HbA1c levels were analysed at a 6-monthly interval, with the most up-to-date HbA1c level for a given period used for analysis if there were more than one HbA1c result in a 6-month interval.Descriptive statistics of the HbA1c levels were performed. HbA1c levels at baseline were also compared against the levels at months 6, 12, 18 and 24 using paired t-test.Results: All 47 adults with CFRD in Sheffield have received CFRD care with this new setup since April 2014. The median age of the cohort is 31 years (IQR 23 to 38 years), everyone is pancreatic insufficient, with 22/47 (46.8%) females, 42/47 (89.4%) homozygous for class I-III mutations (based on international consensus) and 31/47 (66.0%) have chronic Pseudomonas (based on Leeds criteria).There is a trend of improving HbA1c levels and reducing variability in the HbA1c levels for the cohort of adults with CFRD. These improvements are statistically and potentially clinically significant. These improvements are also sustained over a 2-year period.Conclusions: Following the implementation of the new CFRD care setup in the Sheffield Adult CF Centre, there have been significant improvements of HbA1c levels sustained over 2 years, which indicates better diabetes control. Further longitudinal data will be collected to determine the impact of these improvements on other health outcomes (such as FEV1, BMI and exacerbation rates) and to determine whether these improvements persist over a longer period.

Nursing, UCF, Orlando, FL, USA Objective: To examine how readiness for transition to adult health care and self-care management skills in youth with cystic fibrosis (CF) is related to age, caregiver congruence on perceived transition readiness, and frequency of transition discussion with provider.",

            "text": "Methods: A descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional design investigated how perception of readiness to transition to adult health care for youth with CF is related to age for five self-care management activities (managing medications, appointment keeping, tracking health issues, talking with providers, and managing daily activities). Youth with CF (n = 58), age 14-22 years (m = 16.5) , and 52 caregivers were recruited from 4 pediatric CF clinics in Florida. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ; Wood DL, et al., Acad Pediatr. 2014; 14:415-22 ) and a modified version (TRAQ-C) for caregivers, with a Likert-type scale (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) were utilized for data collection. These instruments are based in a behavior Stages of Change Model and rank acquisition of skill level through five stages of readiness to perform the task.Results: All five-regression equations suggest that age predicts youth perception of self-care management skill in all five domains on the TRAQ (p \u2264 .009). A paired t-test was utilized to compare the overall TRAQ and TRAQ-C mean scores between youth and caregiver dyads. Youth scored significantly higher in perception of self-care skill management (m = 3.187, sd = .769) than caregivers (m = 2.490, sd = .788; t = 7.408, df = 51, p < .001). The majority of youth perceived skills as contemplating or desiring to learn in the domains of medication management, appointment keeping, and tracking health issues. The majority of youth perceived they were actively completing skills in the domains of talking with providers and managing daily activities. The agreement between youth and caregivers that a transition discussion with providers had occurred was statistically significant (p = .003).Conclusions: Findings indicate that although increasing age predicts perception of self-care management, the majority of youth age 18-22 were still contemplating skills required in the domain of appointment keeping, and were starting to learn skills in the domain of tracking health issues, and therefore still dependent on their caregivers. Further results indicate that at age 14 youth are contemplating, or beginning to learn self-care management skills in three of the five domains, with the majority actively talking to providers and managing daily activities. This indicates that age 14 is appropriate to begin transition skill evaluation. Despite the differences in perception of skills between youth and caregiver, scores from all self-care management domains followed a similar trend, thereby arguing validity of the scores. Participation in this study elicited appreciation, increased self-reflection, and raised awareness of skills necessary for independent care as they reflected on completion of the questionnaire. Anecdotal comments from caregivers indicated that they had not considered transferring knowledge of certain skills to their child necessary for adult care, underscoring the importance of beginning transition discussion and skill evaluation in youth with CF at an early age. Introduction: More cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are living into adulthood and therefore require becoming an active partner in their adult care. The importance of pediatric to adult healthcare transition is recognized by the CF Foundation and the American Academy of Pediatrics; however, best practices associated with the transfer of care remain unclear.",

Analysis revealed high levels of anxiety regarding transitioning care with 53% reporting they were somewhat or very anxious at the time of transfer. Respondents were less anxious if they reported higher satisfaction with their opportunities to discuss transfer questions and transfer timing with their providers (r=-0.36, p=0.011, r=-0.4, p=0.004 respectively) . Approximately half of participants were satisfied with their transition timing. Others preferred an earlier (SR 9%; EE 21%) or a later (SR 43%; EE 32%) transfer. Of survey respondents, 81% agreed or strongly agreed that meeting with adult CF providers in the pediatric clinic reduced their anxiety. Despite 73% of respondents reporting they were independent in their care at transition, they also reported self-identified knowledge deficits in insurance knowledge (66%), medication refills (43%), and making clinic appointments (24%). Comparison of patients who transferred before a formal transition program was implemented to patients who participated in our formalized transition process demonstrated higher levels of satisfaction with the transfer of their care in those who participated in the formal transition program (X 2 (4)=10.15, p=0.038).Conclusion: The majority of patients found it anxiety-provoking to leave their pediatric providers, although inclusion of adult CF providers within their final visit to the pediatric clinic attenuated this concern. Patients vary in readiness and preference for transition timing. Despite a high level of patient-perceived transition readiness, patients reported significant knowledge deficits. Future transition programs may benefit from partnering with adolescents to choose a transition time based on individual skill mastery and readiness rather than age.

            "text": "Patients: Sixteen lung-transplanted CF patients (10 M/ 6 F) with a mean age of 33 (\u00b116) years followed at Stockholm CF Center participated in the study. Mean number of years from transplantation was 6 years (range 3 months to 22.5 years). Thirteen patients participated throughout the twoyear study period, 2 died, 1 patient moved to another city and was lost for follow-up for 17 months.Method: A nurse (SU) at every visit (minimum monthly) used Motivational Interviewing as a directive person-centred approach designed to activate motivation for change, i.e. in this case to become more adherent to anti-rejection therapy.As in the previous study the following 3 questionnaires were used (minimum monthly): 1) IMAB (Identifying Medication Adherence Barriers), a self-report questionnaire which consists of 28 statements referring to common barriers to medication-taking with a category response option for each statement. 2) BAASIS (Basel Assessment of Adherence Scale for Immunosuppressive) and 3) TAQ (The Transplant Adherence Questionnaire).Adherence of the patients was defined as taking medications, timing within 2 hours of prescribed/scheduled time and dosage.The patients were followed from April 2014 until April 2016 during which time questionnaires were filled in monthly. A nurse also called the patients (n=3) who were the most frequently \"nonadherent\" between their visits to the clinic.Result: Every age group increased their adherence. Mean adherence of the patients (defined as above) was initially 40%, which rose to over 80% and was maintained at the level with the highest adherence of 93% and temporarily dropped to 64% in January 2015 and 73% in January 2016. The most compliant group was the age group \u226543 years. They increased their adherence from 63% to 86%. The most nonadherent was the age group 19-30 years. They increased their adherence from 25% to 50%. The age group 31-42 years increased from 33% to 67%.The patients had most difficulties with the timing. At baseline 40% of the patients were adherent to timing and at the end of this study, 86%. As in our short-term study, males were more adherent than females. Males increased their overall adherence from 33% to 89%; females from 50% to 80%.Conclusion: We have shown that by the use of Motivational Interviewing (and telephone calls) patients can maintain a higher degree of adherence over time.Our results support MI to be a feasible and acceptable intevention which easily can be used in the clinic to help lung-transplanted patients to become more adherent to anti-rejection medication.",

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA Background: Microbiology results were delivered to patients and/or their families by many means depending on the patient's and/or physician's preference. This practice was inefficient and had the potential to cause delays in treatment.Objective: The purpose of this study was to standardize the reporting of throat and sputum microbiology results to patients and/or their families. Standardization decreases the time between the collection of the specimen and delivery of subsequent results, decreases inefficiencies in the delivery communication method, and improves patient satisfaction. Standardizing the delivery of microbiology results also benefits the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) RN care coordinator by reducing the number of telephone calls and time spent on the telephone communicating results that resulted in no change to the plan of care.Method: Surveys were sent to 84 patients and/or their families to assess their satisfaction in the delivery of microbiology results. A total of 36 surveys were returned. It was calculated that 39% of patients and/or their families were very satisfied with the current process, 8% were satisfied and 14% were neutral. In that survey, patients and/or their families were also asked to indicate their preferred method of communication related to microbiology results. Most patients and/or their families preferred to receive results via the electronic medical record online messaging option or to receive a telephone call. Following the survey, a practice change was made. The CF RN care coordinator monitored all pending microbiology results on a daily basis. Once the cultures finalized, they were sent to the physician for interpretation and review. If there were no changes from previous culture results and no change to the plan of care, patients were sent a brief online message from the CF RN care coordinator. The message explained the results and included a copy of the results. If the patient and/or their family did not have access to online messaging, a clinical note explaining the results and a copy of the results were mailed to their home. If there was a change in the results and/or a change in the plan of care, the new information was shared with patients and/or their families via a telephone call, and they were mailed a copy of the results to their home. To provide patient/family education, with each mailing, a copy of \"Germs and Cystic Fibrosis: the Facts\" was included. After piloting the practice change for 6 months, the same survey was sent again to the same 84 patients and families.Results: A total of 24 of the 84 surveys were returned, and the results following the pilot were as follows: 63% of the patients and families were very satisfied, 25% were satisfied and 13% were neutral. Staff satisfaction has increased due to fewer telephone calls and time spent on the telephone.Conclusion: Standardizing the delivery of microbiology results has increased both patient/family and staff satisfaction, decreases the time between the collection of the specimen and delivery of subsequent results, Methods: Anonymous online surveys of CF patients and caregivers were conducted annually from 2008 to 2015. The response rates ranged from 7-17% of those contacted to participate. Respondents were surveyed on cost sharing responsibilities and their impact on care-seeking behaviors, insurance coverage and the use of supplemental coverage or financial support. Trends over time were compiled to examine changes in insurance and patient concerns.Results: From 2008-2015, 99-100% of CF patients had health insurance coverage. An average of 71% of patients obtained health insurance through an employer while an average of 26% obtained health insurance through Medicare or Medicaid. Type of coverage remained stable over time except for a 9% drop in patients covered by Medicaid from 2014 to 2015. Costs of monthly health insurance premiums have increased from 2008-2015; fewer patients were paying under $200 per month and more patients were paying over $300 per month over time. Since 2012, patients reported increasing concern regarding changes to health insurance policies and a decline in concerns regarding losing health coverage altogether. \"Difficulty meeting financial demands of CF treatment and living expenses\" remained a consistent concern throughout all survey years. A larger percent of patients with health insurance coverage through Medicare, higher out-ofpocket cost responsibilities, or lower household incomes delayed seeking or getting medical care and took smaller or fewer doses of prescribed medications in the past twelve months due to cost every survey year.Conclusions: This study examined how cost and coverage concerns influenced patient access to care over time. From 2008-2015, patients and caregivers continuously reported difficulties meeting the demands of CF care. While patients are decreasingly concerned about losing health insurance coverage altogether, they are increasingly concerned about changes to insurance policies. Across each survey year, higher out-of-pocket responsibilities, public insurance coverage, and lower household incomes were consistently associated with adverse care-seeking behaviors. Inconsistent care and lack of access to prescribed treatments could negatively impact patient health and cause long-term health consequences. Further research should address the impact of cost-sharing on clinical outcomes for those with CF. Introduction: Female urinary incontinence (UI) is a well known cystic fibrosis (CF) complication. However there is little information on the assessment and treatment of this condition, despite its considerable impact on daily activities and quality of life.Objectives: To evaluate if an informative booklet regarding UI is a useful tool for CF women.Methods: An interviewer-administered questionnaire was submitted to 37 CF women in order to detect those with UI. Urinary leakage was reported by 28 of them, who received an informative booklet which contains general and detailed aspects related to UI. After 1 month, a self-administered questionnaire was administered to the booklet's users in order to evaluate its usefulness. Main questions regarded the interest, the comprehension and the practical effectiveness of the booklet. Descriptive analyses were performed on the answers given.Results: The questionnaire was completed by 24 women (median age 31.9 y, range 18.6-48.2 y). All patients judged the booklet interesting. More than 90% of patients found pictures and terms easy to understand. The majority of women improved their consciousness about UI issues and changed their habits. Major details are reported in the Figure. Conclusion: UI is common in CF women. It is important to actively investigate and inform about this problem. Given the lack of patients self-reporting and of knowledge of treatment availability, a simple informative booklet could help women to become more aware, express their concerns and manage UI problems. Further studies are necessary in order to assess if a booklet could be considered a potentially useful tool depending on the severity of female urinary incontinence.",

            "text": "McDermott, L. Pharmacy, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand Introduction: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) take a range of regular medicines. This varies both in number and type of medicine depending on their diagnosis and symptoms. When a child is admitted to hospital, the clinical pharmacist has an opportunity to review and counsel on medicines. Most young children have difficulties engaging in such learning sessions so an interactive game was developed to overcome these difficulties.Method: A well-known children's board game was modified for the purposes of medicines education. This game was individualised for each child, with CF aged 3-10 years, who was admitted as an inpatient for extended antimicrobial treatment. The first education session was used to verbally find a baseline of the knowledge of their medicines. During the following visit, the game was played and the child's medicines knowledge assessed again. A third session was held when possible.Results: All children improved their medicines knowledge after playing the game. Preliminary results from the first six months show the biggest improvement was for one child, who improved knowing the medicines name and its purpose from 3/11 to 10/11 medicines. Further results will be collected until August 31st 2016.Conclusion: All children were excited about having their \"own game\" to take home. They engaged with the pharmacist and in all cases their knowledge improved. The plan is to play the game with the children on an ongoing basis, making adjustments as medicines change, to further increase their medicine knowledge.The potential for this game to be included in patient counselling is enormous. It could also be used for children with other chronic conditions. Methods: To assess patient and family knowledge and identify opportunities for enhancement, multiple choice questionnaires were administered (2012 -2013) . Based on results, targeted quarterly education sessions were delivered (2013 -2014) focusing on airway clearance; energy requirements; order of therapies and enzymes. The program included specific content delivered by the designated team member with written materials posted in the clinic and provided to patient/families. Education delivery was tracked through each quarter and once all quarters were completed, questionnaires were re-administered. Re-survey was completed (2014 Re-survey was completed ( -2015 by the education team members during a clinic visit with a minimum overall goal of 80% completion of eligible patients/parents. Results were compiled and compared to original survey results to determine effectiveness of educational interventions.",

            "text": "Kaplan, E.T. 1 Background: Although genetic testing for CF is common clinical practice, patients may have limited knowledge of the genetic basis of CF. However, as life expectancy increases, patients are required to assume increased responsibility for medical management and family planning decisions. This necessitates concrete knowledge of genetics and reproduction.Objective: The goal of this project was to evaluate the educational needs of adolescents with CF and their parents by assessing their disease-specific genetic knowledge.Methods: Adolescents aged 13 to 21 years presenting to the Emo-ry+Children's CF clinic for routine care were asked to complete an IRB-approved 17-item multiple-choice questionnaire evaluating their CF-specific genetic knowledge. This questionnaire was administered before a genetic counselor (GC) was added to the CF care team. The questionnaire had 3 domains: \"Inheritance,\" \"Carriers,\" and \"Reproduction.\" Linear regression was used to analyze the relationships between number of correct answers and age or adherence. Adherence was measured on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = poor, 5 = very high) by the CF social worker.Results: From August 2015 to January 2016, 83 questionnaires were completed by 55 adolescents and 28 parents from a total of 78 total eligible patients (71% response rate). Average age of the adolescent participants was 16.6\u00b12.3 years. Twenty-three participants (42%) were male.Adolescents answered 8.8\u00b13.2 (mean, SD) out of 17 questions correctly and parents 11.8\u00b12.3. No participant answered all 17 questions correctly. The average score for \"Inheritance\" questions was 74% for patients and 93% for parents; for \"Carriers\" questions was 46% for patients and 64% for parents; and for \"Reproduction\" questions 24% for patients and 37% for parents. There were 2 questions answered incorrectly by over 70% of patients and parents. One asked the risk of having a child with CF if one parent had CF and the other tested knowledge on the accuracy of carrier detection.Adherence level did not but age did correlate significantly with genetic knowledge, however, age did have a positive correlation (p=0.53 and 0.03 respectively). In open-ended survey questions, participants reported a desire for further education regarding their abilities to reproduce (25%, n=21), their specific mutation(s) (12%, n=10), and their likelihood of passing CF to their children (7%, n=6).Conclusions: Considerable gaps in CF genetics knowledge were noted to exist in adolescents with CF and their parents. Additionally, a significant number of patients and parents reported a desire for broader disease-specific genetics education. This study was conducted at a large academic CF center prior to the presence of a certified GC in the CF clinic. As such, we conclude that a GC would be an important member of the CF care team in order to help educate patients with CF and their families about genetics and reproduction.Supported by CF Foundation OneCF Learning and Leadership Collaborative. Introduction: In the UK, five babies each week are diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. However, the information that the Cystic Fibrosis Trust was able to offer parents at this time was limited and this was recognised as a significant gap in our provision. Addressing this gap was highlighted as a priority with the approach to development of resources recognised as a critical factor in achieving success. From the outset our aim was to consult widely to ensure the voices of the CF community and clinicians informed the development of the resources. It was felt this would shape the content more closely to actual need and engender a sense of ownership in the final product.Methods: We used the Cystic Fibrosis Trust's Facebook page to make contact with parents and invited them to participate in the production of the resource. There were 38 expressions of interest, from which 20 parents became actively involved. In-depth, qualitative interviews were carried out either face to face or over the telephone with the aim of understanding parents' needs and experiences, and specifically what would have been useful for them at the point of diagnosis. In addition to these interviews, a focus group was held in Birmingham, UK. We consulted with clinicians from specialist multidisciplinary CF teams from across the UK during the information production, and the final content was reviewed by the Trust's Clinical Advisory Group, comprising representation from all nations of the UK and the heads of the specialist CF groups. Based on our consultation with parents, the clinical content was deliberately minimal, however it was important to ensure the clinical information included was both accurate and relevant.Results: From conversations with parents who had experienced diagnosis of CF in their child, it became clear that experiential information would be highly valued by parents, and there were some key themes that shaped the content.To know that there is hope for a positive future Not to be overwhelmed with clinical information Hearing about other families can reduce the sense of isolation Useful to get practical advice on the here and now Signpost to more detailed information when needed Provide information for family and friends Format: The final resource comprised a hardback A5 booklet for parents, leaflet to explain CF for family and friends, and a short film illustrating the experiences of one family following diagnosis, together with a series of filmed interviews with parents and family members.Release and distribution: The pack was released in June 2015 and promoted widely on our social media platforms, through direct communication to CF centres and through presentations to parents groups. It is available as a hard copy or to download from the website and is distributed via specialist CF centres or via the Cystic Fibrosis Trust helpline at the point of diagnosis. Over 80 packs have been given to parents during the first year of release.Evaluation: The number of views of the film and the number of pack downloads are monitored on a quarterly basis. We aim to ensure every family receives a pack at diagnosis. A short questionnaire was sent to pack recipients one year after receipt of the pack to touch base with parents and find out how useful the pack was to them, and whether the Trust could offer any further information and support. Background: Education and engagement with people who have cystic fibrosis (CF) and their families is part of our mission in providing the best care to patients at our CF center. In 2006, our center implemented quarterly CF Education Nights in response to feedback from our patients and families. The programs are a combined effort of both the pediatric and adult CF care teams servicing our 195 pediatric and 133 adult patients. Historically, participants to these events included people with CF and their family members. With the updated infection control guidelines in spring 2013, our center was presented with new challenges as people with CF could no longer attend these events.",

Topics and speakers are determined via input from the care team, current popular news/speakers, and feedback from CF families. We then follow a checklist, developed at our center to ensure that nothing is missed, to finalize all of the details. Families are notified of educational Background: QR-010 is being developed for the chronic treatment of patients with CF associated with the absence of phenylalanine at position 508 (\u0394F508) on CFTR-encoded RNA. QR-010 is a single-stranded RNA oligonucleotide complementary to the \u0394F508 region on the RNA transcription product of the CFTR gene, and as such represents a novel therapeutic approach for CF. QR-010 is being developed as an inhaled therapeutic to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients with at least one copy of the \u0394F508 mutation and to restore functional CFTR protein by targeting the mRNA. NPD is a well-documented assay to diagnose CF which reflects the function of CFTR.Objective: PQ-010-002 is an innovative proof-of-principle study evaluating the effects of QR-010 on the restoration of CFTR function as measured by NPD, following bilateral intranasal administration of QR-010 for a period of 4 weeks (3X weekly; 12 doses total). Study Design: PQ-010-002 is an open-label study of at least 16 subjects in 2 cohorts, one with subjects homozygous and one with subjects who are compound heterozygotes for the \u0394F508 CFTR mutation. All subjects receive a total of 12 intranasal doses of 10 mg (5 mg/ 250 \u03bcL per nostril, 3 times per week) over 4 weeks. Male and female subjects 18 years of age or older with a confirmed diagnosis of CF measured by sweat chloride, confirmed CFTR gene mutations (homozygous or compound heterozygous for the \u0394F508 mutation), screening NPD tracing consistent with the diagnosis of CF and stable pulmonary function with an FEV1 of \u226540% are eligible for enrolment. Subjects receiving CFTR potentiators or correctors, or those with a recent significant change in CF maintenance medications were excluded. NPD tests are conducted according to the standardized CFF-TDN SOP. All NPD tracing/data are evaluated, reviewed and qualified by a central independent reviewer who is blinded to subject ID and to the NPD time point. The study design includes an optional Part B consisting of 2 additional cohorts who would receive 12 doses of up to 25 mg (12.5 mg/ 250 \u03bcL per nostril).Endpoint: The primary endpoint is the within-subject change in CFTR-mediated total chloride transport relative to baseline (measured by NPD) after 6 doses (Day 15), 12 doses (Day 26), and 21 days following the last dose (Day 47\u00b13 days). Additional measurements include full analysis of the NPD tracing, safety, and sweat chloride at multiple timepoints.Results: 10 homozygous and 8 compound heterozygous subjects are included from 5 study sites. No subjects withdrew. No safety concerns are reported. Efficacy results and conclusions will be provided at NACFC.Financial Support: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 633545 and from the CF Foundation.",
