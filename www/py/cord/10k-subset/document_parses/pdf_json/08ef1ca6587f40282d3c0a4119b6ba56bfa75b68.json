Problems associated with long term management include the lack of appreciation by both the patient and their doctor of the patient's chronic asthma severity, inadequate long term use of inhaled corticosteroids, and discontinuity of general practice care, with failure to attend a general practitioner between attacks. Similar problems have been identified with the treatment of severe asthma attacks, in particular the inability of the patient, family or doctor to recognise the severity of the fatal attack, and overreliance on inhaled bronchodilator treatment without additional therapy. These factors have been considered to be particularly important in leading to delay in seeking medical help despite the development of a life-threatening asthma attack.

For this to be effective, objective assessment of asthma severity through the educated interpretation of key symptoms and measurements of lung function is required. The development of symptoms suggestive of a viral respiratory tract infection, or of nocturnal wakening with asthma, are recognised as good markers of worsening asthma, while a poor response to increased use of inhaled ~-agonist therapy is an important marker of a severe attack requiring medical treatment. [21, 22] Domiciliary measurements of peak expiratory flow, with values expressed as a percentage of predicted or previous best achieved recordings, represent the most practical method of obtaining objective measurements of lung function. Peak flow monitoring, therefore, can be considered to represent an essential basis of any system of self-assessment, being of particular importance in patients with severe asthma, as they have been shown to have the worst perception of asthma severity,l23,24] Spirometry or peak flow measurements should also form the basis of the physician's assessment of asthma Table IV .

Requirement for the objective assessment of asthma severity with the educated interpretation of key symptoms and peak flow recordings 2.

Integration of self-assessment and self-management with written guidelines for both the long term treatment of asthma and the treatment of acute severe asthma severity, as interpretation of symptoms and signs of asthma are notoriously difficult, even for the experienced physician.l 25 ] Regular high dosage inhaled corticosteroids, with inhaled ~-agonists used as required for relief of symptoms, are recognised as the basis of long term treatment of the high risk asthmatic patient.
