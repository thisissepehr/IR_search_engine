These negative experiences have been shown to lead to higher rates of aversive feeding behaviors and other oral feeding alterations that are prevalent in this population later in infancy and early childhood [1, 40] .

This study was limited by significant variability in the medical courses of the preterm cohort, along with the timing that the feeding assessment occurred (between 35 and 43 weeks PMA for the preterm group and within 4 days of life for the full-term group). Preterm infants were assessed as close to NICU discharge as possible, but this was as early as 35 weeks PMA in some infants. The preterm group was evaluated during a period of rapid change in feeding skills, which could have introduced variability in performance. While there were no significant differences in the PMA at the time of testing among the preterm and full-term group, it is unclear if the findings would have been different if the preterm group was assessed at a different time period. Likewise, the time period in the hospital after full-term delivery is a period of transition, and feeding performance may or may not have evolved in the days or weeks following the assessment in the full-term group. There were more infants who were breastfed during the assessment in the full-term cohort, and it remains unclear if overall feeding performance could have been better or worse based on whether the infant was breast or bottle-fed. Feeding assessment was limited to one time frame, and this feeding assessment may or may not have been representative of the infant's general feeding performance. The feeding assessment also could have been impacted by other factors including the feeder, other activities that occurred during the day, hunger, or environmental factors. This study also relied on multiple comparisons, which increases the risk of a Type I error. The sample was derived from studies aimed at exploring early feeding performance, but the current study did not undergo prior power analysis. Despite these limitations, this is the first study, that we know of, to analyze the multiple components of feeding skill performance in preterm infants at term equivalent age compared with fullterm infants.
