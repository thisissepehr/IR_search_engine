As new health-related information is released from the clinical and research communities, it is translated for and disseminated to the public through a variety of mechanisms. In the past, healthcare providers served as the primary source of health-related information for patients. Today, however, an unprecedented interest in health issues has led to intense media coverage of medical developments. Moreover, the internet has given interested individuals rapid access to virtually unlimited sources of information. Because of this symbiotic relationship between public interest and media attention, the actual impact or severity of a public health problem can be disproportionate to the amount of media coverage it receives, creating a climate of unnecessary fear and obscuring important health messages [1] .",

The topics were chosen based on their impact on reducing death, illness, and disability in the United States, and include advances such as vaccinations, improved maternal and child health, safer and healthier food, fluoridation of drinking water, and safer workplaces. Also among this list is control of infectious diseases, resulting from improvements in sanitation, access to clean water, and the development and use of effective vaccines and antibiotics. So dramatic were these advancements that by the middle of the 20 th century infectious diseases were no longer viewed as major public health threats in the United States and in many other developed countries. This false sense of security was short lived, however, as newly recognized and reemerging diseases continued to appear, many of which produced devastating consequences -most notably HIV/AIDS.",

The new report categorizes the spectrum of microbial threats into five areas: the global burden of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; antimicrobial-resistant infections; vectorborne and zoonotic diseases; chronic diseases with infectious etiology; and microbes intentionally used for harm. The report also describes more than a dozen factors -human, biological, social, and environmental -that can work alone or in combination to produce a global microbial threat. Examples of these factors include human demographics, behavior, and susceptibility to infection; changes in technology, industry, travel, and commerce; changing ecosystems and microbial hosts; and social and political factors such as poverty and other inequities, lack of political will, and the consequences of war and terrorism.",

The global outbreak began on February 21, 2003, when a Guangdong physician, traveling while ill, spent one night in a Hong Kong hotel. Although the exact modes of transmission are unknown, this individual would infect more than a dozen other hotel guests and visitors, many of whom served as index patients for major outbreaks in Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and Canada [10] (Fig. 1) . In Singapore, more than 170 of the country's 238 SARS cases were linked to a single individual who became infected at the Hong Kong hotel [11] .",

Despite its tragic health consequences and strong social, economic, and political impact, SARS was fortunately not the feared \"Big One,\" appearing to spread primarily by droplets during close contact. The SARS outbreak uncovered both strengths and weaknesses in global disease detection and response efforts and can therefore serve as a strong warning as well as an opportunity to prepare for future threats [12] . SARS clearly showed the unpredictability of emerging infectious threats and the vulnerability of even the most developed nations. The virus did not respond to treatment, and no vaccine was available. The use of strict isolation and quarantine precautions -some involving tens of thousands of individuals -proved the best means of stopping the epidemic. Box 2. Improving preparedness and response: lessons learned from recent outbreaks -Strengthening existing and developing new national and international partnerships -Training and educating a multidisciplinary workforce -Ensuring \"full use\" of investments -Encouraging transparency and political will -Fostering a global commitment to address inequities -Developing and implementing preparedness plans and research agendas -Proactively communicating with health professionals, the media, and the public While the first line of defense in controlling an outbreak remains strong national surveillance systems that can readily detect outbreaks, the SARS experience highlighted the importance of global disease detection efforts [13] . The same interconnected world that enables microbes to rapidly cross borders can also work to effectively stop their spread, providing an opportunity for establishing surveillance systems that can approach real time. For SARS, the internationally coordinated response led by WHO allowed clinical, research, and public health experts around the world to exchange information on the new disease as quickly as it evolved. Part of this effort included the WHO Collaborative Multi-center Research Project on SARS Diagnosis, a network involving more than a dozen laboratories and 10 countries. In less than a month, three of these laboratories determined the cause of the illness -a previously unrecognized coronavirus. Also playing a major role in the response was WHO's Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN), a surveillance and response system of more than 120 organizations worldwide. Although GOARN responds to dozens of outbreaks in developing countries each year, the SARS outbreak represented its first response to an internationally spreading illness [13] . Among GOARN's most visible partners are the National Influenza Centers (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/ centres2004/en/). Established in the 1950s, this expansive network of more than 100 institutions in over 80 countries is responsible for tracking influenza viruses to guide vaccine development and to recognize variants that may be capable of producing a pandemic.",

Such investments in human resources must also be met with improvements in research facilities and capacities. The benefits of such efforts can be substantial, extending beyond national borders and allowing for a \"dual\" or \"full\" use of resources. In the United States, investments made to strengthen national bioterrorism preparedness and response efforts over the past several years have improved overall preparedness for public health threats. An example is the Laboratory Response Network (LRN), a network of public and private laboratories established in 1999 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond quickly to acts of chemical and biological terrorism, emerging infectious diseases, and other emergencies.

Dr. Carlo Urbani, an infectious disease physician working in Hanoi for WHO, recognized the unusual severity of the disease and quickly instituted infection control precautions, sadly too late to prevent his exposure to the infection that would cause his death. Dr. Urbani's prompt recognition along with Vietnam's commitment and global cooperation effectively limited the spread of SARS in Vietnam. China ultimately demonstrated one of the most extraordinary acts of political will in addressing the epidemic when more than 4,000 construction workers built a 1000-bed hospital in approximately one week. The importance of political will in addressing infectious diseases continues to be demonstrated most directly by its absence -an all too frequent obstacle to eradication efforts for vaccine-preventable diseases such as polio and measles.",

During the SARS epidemic, the availability of electronic communications enabled networks of laboratory scientists, clinicians, and public health experts to share information and rapidly generate a scientific basis for public health action against a novel disease [17] -a major step toward lessening the health consequences of the outbreak. These extraordinary efforts and swift actions, however, did not prevent the severe social and economic ramifications that resulted from SARS. These consequences, largely generated by the fears and perceptions of a vulnerable public, highlight the critical need to communicate timely and accurate information in the face of scientific uncertainty. Proactive communications directed at health professionals can enhance the ability of those on the front lines to detect the unusual -e.g., test results or patient symptoms that could signal the occurrence of a new health threat. Similarly, proactive and open communication between public health officials and policymakers is essential for sound public health action. Finally, proactive communications through public health websites and with the media can help ensure broad dissemination of timely and accurate risk information to members of the public that can enable them to make important decisions in protecting their health.",
