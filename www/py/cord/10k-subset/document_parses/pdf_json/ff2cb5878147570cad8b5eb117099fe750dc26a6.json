Recently, the analysis of spreading processes has been extended from static networks to temporal networks, where nodes and links appear and disappear. We focus on the effects of accessibility, whether there is a temporally consistent path from one node to another, and reachability, the density of the corresponding accessibility graph representation of the temporal network. The level of reachability thus inherently limits the possible extent of any spreading process on the temporal network. We study reachability in terms of the overall levels of temporal concurrency between edges and the structural cohesion of the network agglomerating over all edges. We use simulation results and develop heterogeneous mean-field model predictions for random networks to better quantify how the properties of the underlying temporal network regulate reachability.",

            "text": "Concurrency, broadly defined as \"relationships that overlap in time\" [9] , is one of the key elements affecting the extent and speed of disease spreading. Concurrency is a longstanding concept in epidemiology and has been considered in diverse contexts, including for understanding the epidemic potential of HIV [9] [10] [11] [12] . Some studies have applied the concept as a property proportional to an average contact rate or an average degree in unit time [11, 12] or as a link density of a reachable network converted from pair-to-pair contact patterns [10] . In another recent study, concurrency was considered as the number of links of an individual in unit time within a generative temporal activity model [13] . Whatever the particular definition of concurrency, the general idea is that increased concurrency increases the density of the effective network structure over which an infection is transmitted, resulting in a larger number of alternative paths between nodes, thus increasing the potential for greater spread through the population. As such, the general conclusion that higher concurrency increases the potential for epidemic spread seems to be trivial. However, the detailed mechanism of this increase is important to understand and to quantify to assess the impact of concurrency in a particular temporal network setting.",

            "text": "Motivated by previous work [9] , we consider the reachability of the temporal contact network over which transmission can occur. Reachability is the density of the accessibility graph that includes an edge from node i to node j if and only if there is a temporally consistent path originating at i that can reach j in the underlying temporal contact network. That is, reachability quantifies the maximum possible impact of the infectious spreading by quantifying the fraction of node pairs that can be accessible via temporally consistent paths (see, e.g., [9, [14] [15] [16] ). Reachability is a useful metric not only because it measures the maximal substrate of infectious spreading, but also because it indicates how much temporal continuity can be ignored when one uses an aggregated static network to analyze infection dynamics [15] . The accessibility of a directed node pair quantifies whether there is any path along which a chain of edges can causally propagate the infection. Notions of accessibility and reachability have been suspected to be crucial elements for explaining the diversity of possible epidemic outbreak sizes [17] and have been applied to measure epidemic spreading potential of nodes in an animal trade network [18] . Similarly, Williams and Musolesi [19] applied a concept of reachability to measure the robustness of spatiotemporal networks. By directly measuring the maximal extent of temporally consistent paths, reachability controls the maximal extent of any general spreading dynamics on the temporal network, thus providing a benchmark for the overall potential for infection.",

Temporal concurrency is defined here as the fraction of pairs of links that overlap in time. Meanwhile, structural cohesion measures the effective connectedness in the underlying topology of the time-aggregated network, ignoring the temporal details of the individual edges. A good measure of structural cohesion should embody the notion that highly cohesive networks should be difficult to separate, i.e., by node or edge removal, into separate components. As such, we employ the definition of structural cohesion as the average number of node-independent paths between two nodes [20] , as applied to the network that includes all edges over the total time period studied. We emphasize that structural cohesion is more than a simple function of edge density; rather, it is influenced by the organizational patterns of the connections. In particular, one can observe different amounts of structural cohesion even while keeping the total link density constant.",

Our approximate model focuses on networks that are treelike in the sense of having low structural cohesion, in an effort to develop and assess the accuracy of model approximations for the level of reachability in random temporal networks.

That is, in particular, the timings of the edges emanating from a given node are necessarily independent of each other. As such, the temporal concurrency of edges associated with a given node, measuring the probability that there are such edges overlapping in time, becomes by this independent and identically distributed assumption equivalent to the probability that any randomly selected pair of links overlaps in time. We can thus select two randomly selected links with start times and durations denoted by s 1 , s 2 and d 1 , d 2 , respectively. Without loss of generality, let s 2 s 1 . The probability that these two edges overlap in time is then simply the probability that the duration of the first edge is larger than the difference between starting times d 1 > s 2 \u2212 s 1 .

As such, multiplying the matrix exponentials for any set of consecutive temporal layers yields (after binarizing) the reachable network associated with that combination of layers. However, in practice for larger temporal networks, it is significantly more efficient computationally to instead directly calculate the connected components of T w and replace the matrix exponential with the binary indicator matrix whose elements specify whether the corresponding pair of nodes is together in the same component at that time. Similarly, to save memory overhead, steps 3 and 4 can be trivially combined to consider only one temporal layer at a time. For even larger networks whose adjacency matrices must be represented as sparse matrices to fit in memory, the corresponding accessibility graph could instead be constructed one row at a time, updating the running average of the density R to calculate the overall reachability.",

As shown in Fig. 4(a) , the approximationR that includes the specific path length information between node pairs in the network largely underestimates the reachability. If anything, we should not be surprised thatR underestimates the true value of R like this, since the calculation leading t\u014d R only considers reachability along node-independent paths. As such, the increased error made byR in increasing from k \u2248 2 to 3 is expected, though the size of the resulting error emphasizes the apparent importance of available detours around these paths even for these small mean degrees. We note in particular that theR approximation is quite good at very low concurrency C, where the node-independent shortest paths presumably have greater dominance because longer paths along detours become even more unlikely to maintain temporal consistency. However, the limiting behavior of the approximation in the R \u2192 1 approach as C \u2192 1 is clearly incorrect.

Recalling the explicit role of the number \u03ba (i, j) of such paths between nodes i and j in our approximations, we ask whether the relationship between reachability and concur-rency observed numerically might be captured by assuming some other effective values for \u03ba. In Fig. 7 we continue to consider reachability on the k \u2248 3 ER networks. Focusing for this figure only onR s approximations built from p(k) degree distributions and p( ) distributions of geodesic shortest paths, we reproduce here our regularR s approximation using \u03ba (i, j) = min(k i , k j ) from Fig. 4(b) . This approximation overestimates the reachability at low concurrency because the p( ) distribution of geodesic shortest paths are shorter on average than the full set of node-independent shortest paths (the latter used in ourR n approximations). As seen in Fig. 7 , this overestimate at low concurrency can also be at least partially corrected for by decreasing the effective cohesion used in the approximation formulas to \u03ba = 1.5. (For comparison, the average structural cohesion of the underlying ER networks is \u03ba . = 2.08.) Of perhaps greater interest, we see in Fig. 7 that the underestimated reachability at large C appears to be corrected for at this level of modeling by choosing an effective cohesion value of \u03ba = 3.5, yielding a good approximation over the range 0.5 C 1. We believe that identifying such effective cohesion values as modeled from other network features (as opposed to curve fitting here) may be an interesting direction for future work, as a means of extending the range of validity of our tree-based approximations.",

Within thisR model framework, we then usedR n to represent results obtained using the measured distribution of nodeindependent path lengths p( ), whereasR s represents results using the measured geodesic shortest paths to approximate the p( ) distribution. Comparing theR n andR s model results indicates the potential level of sensitivity in the model from the details of the path length distribution p( ). It would be interesting in future work to assess this sensitivity under model approximations for either of these path length distributions (cf. the empirical distributions used here).",

Specifically, our approximation correctly captures R = 1 at C = 1, but the manner of approach as C \u2192 1 is noticeably incorrect compared to the simulated temporal network measurements, unless we artificially select an increased cohesion value as in Fig. 7 . Given the relatively simple shape of the reachability versus concurrency curves, it is perhaps possible that a theory that is only correct in capturing the limiting C \u2192 1 behavior of reachability might be matched or otherwise combined with our present model to better approximate reachability over the whole C \u2208 [0, 1] interval.",

In contrast, there are other temporal network data sets that are in the form of lists of contacts that are present in each temporal snapshot, with the possibility that a given pair of nodes might be in contact at one time, not connected at a later instant, and then connected again at a still later moment. In such settings, it may be useful to distinguish the notion of instantaneous concurrency, counting concurrently appearing links at a contact time, from an interval concurrency calculated over all temporally interleaved links. That is, this notion of interval concurrency is equivalent to that obtained assuming that every edge is present for the full duration from its first appearance to its last. We studied the differences between instantaneous concurrency and interval concurrency, and the effect of these representations on reachability, for a variety of example networks in Ref. [32] . We found in that study that the change between the contact and interval representations barely affects the reachability of the sample empirical networks studied there. We believe this result emphasizes the importance of the start and end times, with the interevent contact time details being less important for setting the level of reachability in these cases. It will be worthwhile to further investigate the possible effects of substituting contact data with interval duration representations, especially as it impacts models for infection spread on temporal networks.",

We hope this study can give more insights for the diversity and predictability of outbreak sizes [17] , measurements of the epidemic potential of nodes [18] , and the estimation of the robustness of temporal networks [19] . With a more complete integrated picture of this interplay, it may be possible in the future to identify different immunization strategies for outbreaks on empirical temporal networks in terms of their estimated structural and temporal properties. For example, such models could then be used to help predict possible benefits obtainable from targeting hub nodes in the underlying contact network versus individual-level or population-level interventions to decrease concurrency. To complement our tests on ER networks, we additionally consider networks with exponential degree distributions that have been rewired to match the structural cohesion of ER networks having the same mean degree. We construct a network with an exponential degree distribution using the configuration_model function in the NetworkX package in PYTHON, which follows steps described in [33] . A degree sequence {k i } for nodes i = 1, . . . , N is generated by independent draws from the given distribution p(k) = k \u22121 e \u2212k/ k , where k is the desired mean degree. We used the largest connected component from the generated network. We removed self-loops and multiedges and only accepted the resulting network if the mean degree was within 0.1 of the desired k . We note in particular that this procedure does not properly sample the space of simple configuration model graphs without self-loops and multiedges [34] . However, for our present purpose of using these networks as random examples, we do not rely on obtaining a proper sampling of the space. We have not shown figures here exploring our approximations for these exponential degree distribution networks, since they are qualitatively similar to that discussed for ER networks in the main text, in particular having better accuracy at small C.",

We randomly choose two links (i, j) and (i \u00a1 c, j \u00a1 c). If cutting these links does not break the network up into multiple components, we cut these links and then replace them with either (i, i \u00a1 c) and ( j, j \u00a1 c) or (i, j \u00a1 c) and (i \u00a1 c, j). In so doing, we reject new candidate edges that generate multiedges or self-loops and then select the pair of edges that make the new structural cohesion closest to the FIG. 10. Reachability R versus temporal concurrency C for random graphs with different degree distributions. The ER origin graphs are Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs with mean degree k = 3, yielding an empirically expected cohesion \u03ba = 2 (magenta line). The ER graphs are with mean degree k = 3 rewired to obtain expected cohesion \u03ba = 1.7 (red line). The EXP origin graphs here are exponential degree distributions with the same k = 3, yielding an empirically expected cohesion \u03ba = 1.6 (green line). The EXP denotes rewired graphs having exponential degree distribution, yielding expected cohesion \u03ba = 1.7 as described in the Appendix. The filled area shows the standard deviation. desired value. If neither rewiring option successfully moves the cohesion closer to the target value, the original cut edges are restored. By this method, the degree distribution remains constant while the degree-degree correlation and the structural cohesion change. We repeat this rewiring process until either the target value of structural cohesion is obtained (to within a tolerance here of 0.025) or if the target is not achieved within E rewires then the process is restarted with a new random graph generated from the distribution. Figure 10 demonstrates the reachability of rewired ER and exponential degree distribution networks with the same average degree ( k = 3) and structural cohesion ( \u03ba = 1.7). Even though the mean degree and structural cohesions of these random graphs are the same, the relationship between reachability and concurrency is noticeably different in the figure. This observation further motivates the development of our approximations in the main text in terms of degree distributions and path lengths.",
