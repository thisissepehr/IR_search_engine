Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce fibroblast proliferation and differentiation through activation of phosphoinositide3-Kinase (PI3-K) pathway. However, the detail mechanism by which LPS contributes to the development of lung fibrosis is not clearly understood. To investigate the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a PI3-K pathway suppressor, on LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, collagen secretion and activation of PI3-K, we transfected PTEN overexpression lentivirus into cultured mouse lung fibroblasts with or without LPS treatment to evaluate proliferation by MTT and Flow cytometry assays. Expression of PTEN, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phosphorylation of Akt were determined by Western-blot or real-time RT-PCR assays. The PTEN phosphorylation activity was measured by a malachite green-based assay. The content of C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) in cell culture supernatants was examined by ELISA.",

Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta protein expression levels in the LPS-induced PTEN overexpression transfected cells were significantly lower than those in the LPS-induced non-transfected cells, which can be reversed by the PTEN inhibitor, bpV(phen). Conclusions: Collectively, our results show that overexpression and induced phosphatase activity of PTEN inhibits LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion through inactivation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3beta signaling pathways, which can be abrogated by a selective PTEN inhibitor. Thus, expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN could be a potential therapeutic target for LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with PTEN expression level, phosphatase activity of PTEN is more crucial in affecting lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion.",

Occurrence of ALI and ARDS can be due to exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), endotoxins produced by Gramnegative bacteria. Previous studies have found that focal aggregation of lung fibroblasts occurred prior to formation of fibrosis [5] , implying that aberrant proliferation of fibroblasts takes place in the early stages of ALI/ARDS. Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by fibroblast proliferation and differentiation to myofibroblast that are responsible for production of collagen [6, 7] . Our previous studies have shown that LPS was able to directly induce secretion of collagen in primary cultured mouse lung fibroblasts via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated activation of the phosphoinositide3-kinase-Akt (PI3-K-Akt) pathway [8, 9] . LPS was also reported to induce fibroblasts proliferation [10] , down-regulate phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression [11, 12] .",

Downregulation of PTEN expression and suppression of its dephosphorylation activity induce proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of glioma cells through activation of the PI3-K-Akt-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) pathway, suggesting that PTEN may be involved in inactivation of PI3-K signaling [14] . PTEN restoration was also related to the inhibition of differentiation of human lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts through extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/Akt inhibition [15] . The negative regulatory role of PTEN on the PI3-K-Akt pathway suggests that, without LPS stimulation, PTEN prevents the proliferation of lung fibroblasts, and that overexpression of PTEN might abrogate the fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, activation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3\u03b2 and collagen secretion induced by LPS.

In our study, PTEN expression and its dephosphorylation activity were inhibited when cells were stimulated with LPS; the underlying mechanism remains unclear but may be correlated with LPS-induced activation of transcription factors such as c-Jun, NF-\u03baB, and HES-1 [24, [29] [30] [31] . This needs to be studied further. Figure 3 The effect of PTEN overexpression on proliferation of LPS-induced lung fibroblasts. The effect of overexpression of PTEN on lung fibroblast proliferation at 72 h after 1 \u03bcg/mL LPS challenge was detected using MTT and Flow cytometry assays (3A, MTT assay. 3B and 3C, Flow cytometry assay). bpV(phen)(1 \u03bcM for 0.5 h) was examined to investigate the effect of overexpression of PTEN on lung fibroblast proliferation. PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002 (50 \u03bcmol/L for 1 h) was used to assess the effect of PTEN overexpression and PI3-K-Akt pathway inhibition on lung fibroblast proliferation in the presence or absence of LPS. *p < 0.05 vs. Blank and Empty group; \u2020 p < 0.05 vs. PTEN group; \u2021 p < 0.05 vs. PTEN LPS group. \u00a7 p < 0.05 vs. PTEN group; || p < 0.05 vs. PTEN LPS group. Columns represented mean values and error bars represented SD. Flow cytometry graphs shown in Figure B were representative of three independent experiments. Previous studies have found that PTEN methylation [32] and its knockout through RNA interference [33] increased cell proliferation and collagen metabolism [27] , as did dephosphorylation of its protein product [34] . Our results in the present study further showed that LPS-induced cell proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion could be inhibited in lung fibroblasts transfected with a PTEN overexpression lentivirus, which increased both PTEN levels and its dephosphorylation activity. Similar results using a PEP-1-PTEN fusion protein transfected into macrophages [35] or adenovirus-mediated PTEN gene transferred into synovial fibroblasts [36] were reported. Therefore, we reasoned that a decrease in PTEN expression and its dephosphorylation activity could be directly involved in inhibiting LPS-induced lung fibroblast cell proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion, and overexpression of PTEN may have potential for pulmonary fibrosis treatment. This finding would be strengthened if in vivo model, such as PTEN KO or transgenic mice, were used to further confirm this.",

Protein products of the PTEN gene can inactivate PI3-K activity with its dephosphorylation activity [40] . We previously showed that blockade of PI3-K using a pharmacological inhibitor (Ly294002) decreased lung fibroblast collagen secretion [41] . As a downstream molecule of PI3-K-Akt, GSK3\u03b2 is also involved in cell growth and other cell cycle-related biological functions [42] [43] [44] . Activation or phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 was found to be a factor in LPS-induced or TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in immune cells [45] [46] [47] . In the current study, we found that overexpression of PTEN enhanced the inhibitory effect of Ly294002 on cell growth, differentiation and collagen secretion concomitant with suppression of phosphorylation of Akt. Our results also suggested that activation of GSK3\u03b2 was involved in the LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion. Considering GSK3\u03b2 was found to be an important downstream molecule of PI3-K-Akt in our previous studies [48] and that of others [49] , we reasoned that the activation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3\u03b2 complex signaling pathways played important role in mediating the LPSinduced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion.",

This implies that the dephosphorylation activity of PTEN is more crucial in the regulation of lung fibroblast functions than PTEN expression. These findings were in accord with one study using lung cancer cells [51] . More experiments using PTEN short interfering RNA (siRNA) are required to further confirm the role of PTEN in affecting lung fibroblast functions. In addition, whether LPSinduced Akt phosphorylation or GSK3\u03b2 expression is the major cause of fibroblast proliferation needs to be determined. Other studies have shown that TSC-2 [52] , PRAS40 [53] , mTORC [54] , GSK3 [55] and FOXO [56] are involved in the phosphorylation of Akt, cell proliferation, and survival pathways. Thus, further determining the role of Akt using Akt siRNA or GSK3\u03b2 siRNA in lung fibroblast proliferation may be required.",

Relative expression of real-time PCR products was determined using the \u0394\u0394Ct method [59] to normalize target gene expression to that of the housekeeping gene (GAPDH).",
