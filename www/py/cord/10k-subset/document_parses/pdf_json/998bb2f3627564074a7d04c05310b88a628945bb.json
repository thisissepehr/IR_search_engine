Vasoplegic syndrome (VS) is a state of shock refractory to catecholamines and vasopressin that is often multifactorial in liver failure patients, and can occur in any phase of liver transplantation (LT) [i.e., pretransplantation, intraoperative, and post-transplantation]. Methylene blue (MB) has been a well-established pharmacologic therapy for VS. However, it has been known to cause dose-related toxicity. Hydroxocobalamin (HXC) is not currently FDA approved for the management of VS, but studies have demonstrated its ability to cause an increase in systolic blood pressure by hypothesized mechanisms with only minimal side effects. To date, only three other reports have demonstrated the use of HXC in LT patients, which highlighted its use both intraoperatively and post-transplantation. Our report illustrates the utility of HXC in four LT patients with VS. Two of these cases illustrate the usefulness of HXC in the pre-transplantation period, which has never been previously reported. HXC is a useful pharmaceutical agent in the management of VS, especially if contraindications to MB exist or in cases of MB-resistant vasoplegia. Further studies with large sample sizes are necessary to ascertain the optimal dosage of HXC in LT patients.",

Systemic vasoplegia is a frequent hemodynamic challenge encountered in patients with chronic liver disease or those undergoing liver transplantation (LT), and it exacerbates shock in this patient population. Vasoplegia is a syndrome defined by hypotension [typically mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 50 mmHg], normal or elevated cardiac output, and reduced systemic vascular resistance (SVR, < 800 dynes/s/cm 5 ) [1] [2] [3] . It is a state of vasodilatory shock that is refractory to catecholamines and vasopressin. The most common cause of vasoplegia in critical care is sepsis [4] . Vasoplegic syndrome (VS) is commonly observed in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (8-12% of patients), with reported mortality rates as high as 25% [5] , and in whom pre-operative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and prolonged duration of cardiopulmonary bypass increases the risk of vasoplegia [6] .",

            "text": "Alterations in SVR correspond to changes in arteriolar diameter that are controlled by the contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells in the tunica media, referred to as vascular 'tone' [4] . Vascular tone is dependent on the rate of intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) influx-efflux (e.g., increased intracytosolic Ca 2+ concentration causes vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and vice versa), which in turn is controlled by intrinsic [nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S)] and extrinsic (catecholamines, angiotensin II, vasopressin) regulators. Evidently, vasoplegia results from overproduction of endogenous vasodilators, mainly NO, carbon monoxide (CO) and H 2 S [1] . CO appears to function as an NO agonist and is produced by heme oxidase in inflammatory states and during breakdown of senescent erythrocytes; H 2 S is an endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing vascular smooth muscle relaxant that acts by binding to adenosine-triphosphate-sensitive potassium (K ATP ) channels, independent of NO [1, 2, 7] .",

Incidentally, HXC, but not its metabolite, produces beneficial alterations in NO metabolism with resultant elevation in systolic blood pressure (sBP), exceeding 200 mmHg in some patients [1, 7, 9] . The exact mechanism by which HXC produces this hemodynamic effect is only hypothesized.

Stress-dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg) were being administered every 8 h. Despite an additional vasopressor (epinephrine), the MAP remained below goal (< 65 mmHg). A bolus IV dose of HXC (5 g over 30 min) produced a 20% increase in MAP and simultaneous reduction in vasopressor requirements. Over the next 24 h, the patient received an additional IV dose of HXC and was able to be weaned off vasopressor support. Ultimately, the patient-with maximal therapy for his ARDS (which included inhaled NO, prone positioning and airway pressure release ventilation) and simultaneous management of his septic shock-was successfully extubated at 72 h post-endotracheal intubation.",

A bolus IV dose of HXC (5 g over 15 min) led to an increase in MAP by 40 mmHg. However, this effect was transient, which we believe was due to the continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) that was in place for her renal failure secondary to progressive hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

On admission, her MELD score was 29. Additionally, the patient developed renal failure due to combined insults of septic shock and HRS requiring CVVH. Leading up to LT, the patient was receiving three vasopressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin, and epinephrine), and her MELD score had advanced to 41. The patient underwent an uncomplicated orthotopic liver transplantation and continued to require persistently increasing doses of vasopressors despite resuscitation with crystalloids, albumin, and blood products following reperfusion of donor allograft. At 4 h post-transplantation, her MAP remained below goal at 58 mmHg. A pulmonary artery catheter placed pre-operatively enabled us to measure her SVR, which was 404 dynes/s/cm 5 . We administered a single IV dose of HXC (5 g over 15 min) with an apparent effect. At 30 min, SVR increased to 1251 dynes/s/cm 5 and MAP was 84 mmHg. The patient was off epinephrine followed by vasopressin over the next 4 h, and lastly off norepinephrine in < 24 h post-operatively. Delayed, residual effect of the patient's hepatic encephalopathy resulted in prolonged post-transplant intubation and transfer out of the ICU on post-operative day 7.

While it is well recognized that infused catecholamines are associated with a variety of adverse effects on the metabolic, immune, and coagulation systems [10] , high-dose, multiple vasopressors induce profound arterial vasospasm which impedes tissue perfusion, thereby exacerbating ischemic injury in shock. Specifically in the case of LT, hepatic arterial flow affects allograft function and survival. While vasopressors elevate and maintain adequate systemic MAP to allow reperfusion of the allograft, at high doses there exists risk of hepatic artery vasospasm with consequent feared complication of thrombosis. In our experience with ESLD patients or LT recipients in shock, we use point-of-care ultrasound as an adjunct with critical information from continuous hemodynamic monitoring devices and biochemical laboratory studies to ascertain etiology of shock, or at the least exclude any if possible. If vasoplegia is suspected following exclusion of hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and neurogenic shock, administration of HXC with or without (if methylene blue [MB] is contraindicated) a trial of MB in a patient requiring two or more vasopressors at high or escalating doses can be justified (see Fig. 1 ). Pulmonary artery catheters aid in confirming the diagnosis of vasoplegia by providing an accurate measure of the SVR. However, newer non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring devices are capable of recording near-accurate estimates of the same [11] . However, a low dBP and an exaggerated pulse pressure (PP) in the absence of cardiac abnormalities could be indicative of vasoplegia [12] . Generally, chronically widened PP occurs secondary to a cardiovascular etiology-for example, the presence of severe aortic regurgitation. Acute, peri-operative, widened PP in a surgical patient hypothetically results from severe intravascular hypovolemia or vasoplegia, or in patients with hyperdynamic circulation due to sepsis, anaphylaxis, and liver failure wherein there is severe vasodilation and increased cardiac output.",
