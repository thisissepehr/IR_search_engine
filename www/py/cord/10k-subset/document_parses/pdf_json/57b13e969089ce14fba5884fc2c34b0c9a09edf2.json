The responsible gene was first identified as that encoding the SH2D1A or SLAM-associated protein (SAP), located in the region of Xq25 [3] [4] [5] [6] . In another cohort of patients with EBV-driven HLH, mutations in the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) gene (also known as the baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 4 (BIRC4) gene) were identified [7] . Although the SH2D1A and XIAP genes are close together on Xq25, the molecular pathogenesis and clinical features of these diseases seem to be distinct [8, 9] . XIAP is a potent inhibitor of programmed cell apoptosis, blocking the activated forms of the effector caspases 3, 7, and 9 via its BIR2 and 3 domains [10] . Patients with XIAP deficiency are often affected with HLH, splenomegaly, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), variable hypogammaglobulinemia, and autoinflammatory phenomena. Monocytes from patients with XIAP deficiency are impaired in their ability to secrete cytokines (including TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-8, and MCP-1) in response to stimulation with nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) ligands. NOD2 is the strongest genetic risk factor associated with Crohn's disease [11] [12] [13] . Thus, one of the characteristic symptoms of XIAP deficiency is IBD. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for XIAP deficiency. However, HSCT for XIAP deficiency has been associated with a poor prognosis compared with that for SAP deficiency [14, 15] , as demonstrated by a retrospective international survey of 19 XIAP-deficient patients who were treated with the procedure [15] . This study revealed that treatment with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) resulted in apparently better prognosis than treatment with myeloablative conditioning (MAC), where 6 of 11 patients in the RIC group survived, as opposed to only 1 of 7 patients in the MAC group. The 1-year probabilities of survival were 14% for the MAC group and 57% for the RIC group. The major causes of death were hepatic veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary toxicity in the MAC group and pneumonia, respiratory failure, and ongoing HLH in the RIC group. To investigate the outcomes and adverse events of HSCT for Japanese patients with XIAP deficiency, we conducted a national survey and identified a total of 29 patients with the disorder from 19 unrelated families, including previously reported patients [16] [17] [18] . Of the 10 patients who underwent HSCT, 9 (90%) have survived.",

The first of the 3 consecutive days with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L or more was defined as the day of engraftment. Primary graft failure was defined as failure to maintain an ANC of 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L for 3 consecutive days after HSCT, by day 28 with bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell grafts or by day 42 with cord blood (CB) grafts [20] . Secondary graft failure was defined as initial engraftment followed by a decline of donor cells to <5% [21] . Engraftment and chimerism of whole blood were measured using either XY fluorescence in situ hybridization for sexmismatched donors or variable number of tandem repeat analysis for same-sex donors. Full and mixed chimerisms were described by detection of >95 and 5-95% of donor hematopoietic stem cells in the recipient's BM or peripheral blood, respectively [22] . Conditioning regimens were classified as MAC if they contained an alkylating agent (busulfan 16 mg/ kg) or total body irradiation (TBI) at a dose that would not allow autologous BM recovery. Conditioning regimens were classified as RIC if they did not meet the definition of the MAC regimen [23] . If there was uncertainty regarding the intensity of the regimen (patient 1), it was classified as an intermediate intensity regimen. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD were graded according to the standard criteria [24, 25] . The probability of survival was estimated through the Kaplan-Meier method. We used all patient data for determining the probability of survival, except for patient 10 whose observation period was too short to evaluate long-term survival. Infection or reactivation of viruses including EBV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and adenovirus was periodically monitored by the antigenemia or quantitative PCR methods.",

A large cohort study showed that most patients with XLP died by the age of 40 years, and more than 70% of the patients had died before the age of 10 years mainly as a result of fulminant infectious mononucelosis and HLH [2] . Although HSCT is the only curative treatment for XIAP deficiency, the result of a previous study revealed that Table 3 Outcomes in the Japanese patients with XIAP deficiency post-HSCT Patient before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). They revealed multiple ulcers before HSCT, but showed a normal bowel mucosa after the procedure transplantation outcomes were apparently poorer than those for SAP deficiency [15] . An international survey reported that 55% of patients with XIAP deficiency developed HLH, and 26% were affected by IBD [26] . In a Japanese survey, 79% of patients developed HLH (Supplementary Table 1 ). Although this HLH frequency is higher than the international average, it is equivalent to those in France (25/35, 71%) and the USA (9/11, 82%). Twelve patients (41%) developed IBD up to the age of 16 years, and this percentage is relatively higher than those in other countries (9-33%) [26] . The occurrence of IBD in XIAP deficiency might be associated with ethnic background.",

The transplantations were performed in different institutions, but all conditioning regimens were RIC, except that for patient 1, who was given an intermediate intensity regimen, but died of HLH and acute respiratory distress syndrome on day 27 post-HSCT, in which virus infection or reactivation might not be involved. Thus, the intensity of conditioning might be linked to survival. In the case of HSCT for patients with XIAP deficiency, RIC was apparently superior to MAC [15] . Successful HSCT outcomes based on RIC for XIAP-deficient patients have been reported in several studies [19, 27, 28] . Patients 1, 5, and 7 had the same R381X mutation, and they developed fatal or severe regimen-related complications, indicating a possible association of gene mutation with the severity of disease. The probability of survival after HSCT was 89%, and the outcome was better than that reported by a previous study, although the follow-up period was limited. It is possible that RIC and HLH control might contribute to the better outcome of HSCT for XIAP deficiency. The high level of donor chimerism in all surviving patients was remarkable, although all of them underwent the RIC regimen. A previous international survey reported that 55% of patients on a RIC regimen of fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab developed mixed chimerism [15] . In our study, the RIC regimen consisted of fludarabine, melphalan, and low-dose TBI or TLI, and only 1 patient developed mixed chimerism. Therefore, low-dose TBI or TLI might contribute to a high level of donor chimerism.",

HLH induced by uncontrolled macrophage activation is often a fatal complication after HSCT and frequently leads to primary and secondary graft failures. Thus, prophylaxis of post-HSCT HLH might play an important role in successful HSCT outcomes. Since DP decreases the viability of primary human macrophages via glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, it is considered effective for the prevention of post-HSCT HLH [29] . In addition, etoposide can be considered as a preconditioning regimen to reduce post-HSCT HLH [30] . In our cohort, post-HSCT HLH developed in 2 of 5 patients (40%) treated with etoposide, whereas 3 of 5 patients (60%) without etoposide treatment developed this condition. Therefore, the use of DP and etoposide could reduce the risk of HLH related to HSCT for XIAP-deficient patients. Alemtuzumab against CD52 was not used for the conditioning regimen in this study owing to its limited usage in Japan. CD52 is highly expressed in monocytes and macrophages, and alemtuzumab administration might reduce the risk of post-HSCT HLH and total doses of etoposide [31] .",
