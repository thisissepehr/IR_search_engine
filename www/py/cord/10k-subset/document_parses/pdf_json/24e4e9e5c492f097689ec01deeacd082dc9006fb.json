It currently lacks integrated crisis management and response programs to understand the importance of decision-making during and in the aftermath of a bioterrorist attack on the food supply. Computer simulations have been used successfully in other industries as training and analysis tools. This paper describes an agent-based simulation for food defense training and analysis. Production information, consumption patterns, morbidity/mortality rates, recall costs and additional information were collected and provided to a datadriven simulation to anticipate the impact of decision-making on economic and public health during a terrorist attack. A case study is given with a representative exercise involving forty industry representatives who participated in a food defense simulation. Their decisions (recall and microbiological and toxicological testing) were derived from testing results, press releases, epidemiological data, and discussions with other industry and regulatory teams. Decisions made during the simulation resulted in over 76,000 illnesses, 45 deaths, and $132 million in recall costs. The no intervention, baseline scenario estimated to result in 91,000 illnesses and 54 deaths, indicating the improved public health outcomes resulting from players' decisions. Participants identified three key learning points: 1) communication between all groups is pertinent and challenging, 2) approaches to solve inherent food safety problems cannot be used to address food defense situations, and 3) human resource procedures regarding new hires and disgruntled employees should involve additional security measures.

FDS represents the complex dynamics of post harvest food supply chain which includes ingredient suppliers, processors, distributors, retailers, and consumers. We demonstrate that FDS can be used to explore and strategize various ways of securing the food supply chain in the context of intentional bioterrorist attacks. The behavior of the entities within the food supply chain is complex and dynamic, due to the of interactions among diverse actors, each with its own goals and objectives. Because of its complexity, the food industry lacks tools to adequately capture the impacts of decisions made at one of the links within the food supply chain have on the rest of the industry and society. When considering intentional contamination scenarios, the actions or inaction of a decision maker who fails to properly understand his or her role within the broader ecosystem can precipitate into mortality, morbidity, and subsequent economic crises. We constructed a virtual representation of the food supply chain and its environment in an agent-based modeling framework that captures the emergent behavior of the system. We present the FDS both as an analysis tool that allows experimentation with new intervention strategies for businesses and regulatory entities to improve the security of the food supply chain against a bioterrorist attack as well as an education tool for elucidating procedures that strengthen or threaten the safety and security of the food supply chain.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Identifying the source and propagation of contamination in the food supply chain is complex due to its scale and the distributed and localized access to information among many different business, government, and media entities.

Agent-based modeling as we employed it in the design of FDS also provides the means to integrate humanin-the-loop decision makers with automated models of decision makers. FDS can be used to establish a network of food defense professionals (stakeholders) from industry, government, first responders, and academia by engaging them in defense scenarios where they learn how to interact in crisis situations. FDS also raises awareness of vulnerabilities in processes and structures that delay or conflict with intervention strategies for addressing intentional contamination events. Using FDS in experimentation allows decision makers in industry, government, and media to improve proactive and reactive procedures for dealing with bioterrorist attacks and serve as a valuable resource for advancing crisis management of the food supply chain.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Social Development Department of the Food, and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations", "authors": [], "year": 2009, "venue": "State of Food Insecurity in the World", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "8--28", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Managing disruption risks in supply chains", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Klendorfer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Saad", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Prod Oper Manag", "volume": "14", "issn": "1", "pages": "1--16", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Global supply chain design considerations: mitigating product safety and security risks", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Speier", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Whipple", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Closs", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Voss", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2011, "venue": "J Oper Manag", "volume": "29", "issn": "", "pages": "721--757", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "The looming threat of bioterrorism", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Henderson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1999, "venue": "Science", "volume": "283", "issn": "", "pages": "1279--82", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Threat of a biological terrorist attack on the US food supply: the CDC perspective", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Sobel", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Khan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Swerdlow", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Lancet", "volume": "359", "issn": "", "pages": "874--80", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Supply chain security without tears.
