AGs have unique characteristics among antimicrobial agents. They exhibit extremely rapid bacterial killing, have a demonstrated synergy with beta-lactams on some bacteria and have a prolonged post-antibiotic effect [16] . In the ICU, inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy is associated with an increased mortality risk in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteraemia. With the increasing occurrence of drugresistant microorganisms, both community-and hospitalacquired, ICU physicians often use empirical combination therapy to increase the initial spectrum coverage. In our study, the rates of appropriate antibiotic treatment in the two groups were not statistically significant and do not explain our main result [17] [18] [19] [20] . The bacteraemias' portals of entry, similarly, could not explain our results. Catheter-related bacteraemias were usually associated to a low mortality rate and were more frequent in the group without AGs. The major adverse effects of AGs are dose-dependent nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. In our study, the rates of adverse events were not increased by AGs. AG nephrotoxicity is influenced by the administration schedule, the duration of treatment and individual variability. The risk of nephrotoxicity is lower for once-daily AG dosing than for traditional twiceor thrice-daily dosing. Our dosing regimen, drug level monitoring and duration of treatment are strictly adherent to our institution's guidelines. We only use once-daily high dosing, with a maximum of 3 days treatment duration.

The usual dosages of betalactams might be less effective. These patients would be the most likely to benefit from the enhanced bactericidal activity offered by a beta-lactam-AG combination therapy. Most studies do not support a benefit for combination therapy. The comparison of AG/beta-lactam combination with betalactam monotherapy has been the subject of numerous studies and meta-analysis. Paul et al., in 2004, reviewed 7,586 patients from 64 clinical trials [1] . Combination therapy did not prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and did not affect patient outcomes. Acute kidney injuries were mostly found in the combination group. Paul et al. found the same conclusions in another meta-analysis published in 2008 [23] . Furno et al., in 2002 , performed a similar meta-analysis focussing mostly on immunocompromised patients [4] . Among 4,795 septic episodes with 1,029 bacteraemias, their conclusions were similar. Safdar et al. found a significant survival advantage with AGs for bacteraemia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in comparative non-randomised studies [3] analysed in a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis by Bliziotis et al. concluded that combination therapy lacks benefit with respect to the selection of drug-resistant organisms, superinfection, treatment failure and mortality [2]. Leibovici et al., reviewing all of the previously mentioned meta-analyses, concluded to a lack of interest of the beta-lactam AG combination [24] . However, it has been objected [8] that most studies included suffered from limitations weakening this interpretation: the studies were heterogeneous and rarely compared the same beta-lactam in both arms. The latter means that it is difficult to relate the difference in efficacy to the AG and not the betalactam. Furthermore, the studies mainly used outdated AG administration schedules, such as thrice-daily administration, long treatment duration and lack of serum monitoring. These are related to treatment toxicity, which was counted as treatment failure in many studies. Finally, Bliziotis et al. suggested that once-daily AG therapy combined with a beta-lactam could have a beneficial effect on the development of resistance compared with beta-lactam monotherapy and should be the subject of further research. Recently, a systematic review of randomised trials focussing on the clinical implications of beta-lactam-AG synergy recommended avoiding the routine use of beta-lactam-AG combination therapy. In a subgroup of bacteraemic patients, they did not find any survival advantage for combination therapy [25] .
