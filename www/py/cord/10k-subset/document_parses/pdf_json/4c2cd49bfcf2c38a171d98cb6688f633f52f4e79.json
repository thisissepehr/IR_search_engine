Surgical and endovascular interventions are the main treatments for advanced pAD but alternative and adjunctive medical therapies are needed. currently the main preclinical experimental model employed in pAD research is based on induction of acute hind limb ischemia (HLI) by a 1-stage procedure. Since there are concerns regarding the ability to translate findings from this animal model to patients, we aimed to develop a novel clinically relevant animal model of pAD. HLi was induced in male Apolipoprotein e (ApoE \u2212/\u2212 ) deficient mice by a 2-stage procedure of initial gradual femoral artery occlusion by ameroid constrictors for 14 days and subsequent excision of the femoral artery. This 2-stage HLI model was compared to the classical 1-stage HLI model and sham controls. ischemia severity was assessed using Laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDpi). Ambulatory ability was assessed using an open field test, a treadmill test and using established scoring scales. Molecular markers of angiogenesis and shear stress were assessed within gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HLI was more severe in mice receiving the 2-stage compared to the 1-stage ischemia induction procedure as assessed by LDPI (p = 0.014), and reflected in a higher ischemic score (p = 0.004) and lower average distance travelled on a treadmill test (p = 0.045). Mice undergoing the 2-stage HLI also had lower expression of angiogenesis markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, p = 0.004; vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2, p = 0.008) and shear stress response mechano-transducer transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (p = 0.041) within gastrocnemius muscle samples, compared to animals having the 1-stage HLI procedure. Mice subjected to the 2-stage HLI receiving an exercise program showed significantly greater improvement in their ambulatory ability on a treadmill test than a sedentary control group. this study describes a novel model of HLi which leads to more severe and sustained ischemia than the conventionally used model. Exercise therapy, which has established efficacy in PAD patients, was also effective in this new model. this new model maybe useful in the evaluation of potential novel pAD therapies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) leads to impaired lower limb blood supply usually as a result of atherosclerosis and associated thrombosis 1 . In 2010 an estimated 200 million people worldwide were living with PAD, an increase of ~30% since 2000 which has been referred to as a PAD pandemic 2,3 . The burden of PAD is increasing worldwide and particularly within low and middle-income countries 4 . PAD is associated with significant morbidity including intense leg pain during walking (intermittent claudication, IC), impaired walking ability, poor health-related quality of life and risk of serious complications such as major leg amputation and death 1 . Medical management of PAD is mainly focused on reducing the risk of cardiovascular events (through statins, blood pressure-lowering and anti-platelet medication prescription), rather than treating leg symptoms 2 . The only drug therapy available for IC is cilostazol 5 . The benefit of this drug have been deemed too small in many countries for it to be publically funded. In high-income countries the most widely used treatments for advanced PAD are surgical approaches to restoring the arterial blood supply to the legs using temporary balloons, permanent stents or open surgical bypasses. Stents and other peripheral revascularisation procedures have a risk of serious complications (such as Wheel System, Columbus Instruments) for 4 weeks.

Blood flow was measured noninvasively by the laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI, moorLDI2, Moor Instruments) system which has been validated extensively and is considered a reference standard for perfusion assessment 26, 27 . Briefly, the assessment of limb perfusion was by acquiring flow images of the ischemic and contralateral limb. All of the mice were evaluated under the same experimental conditions and were scanned from the lower abdomen to the end of the toes. During imaging, ambient light and temperature (maintained at 37 \u00b0C core temperature) were carefully controlled to avoid background variations. Hair was removed by epilating cream on the day prior to LDPI measurements, mice were placed in dorsal decubitus and anaesthetised using isoflurane (2.0% induction dose and 1.8% maintenance dose plus oxygen; 1 L/min, VET Equip). The LDPI system was mounted on a movable track that was fixed 26 cm above the mice limbs while the animals were restrained on a warming table with a black surface. Image analysis software (Laser Doppler Perfusion Measure, V3.08, Moor Instruments) was used to calculate the limb mean flux units, which represents a quantitative analysis of tissue perfusion on a scale of 0 to 1000 perfusion units (PU). Identical regions of both ischemic and contralateral non-ischemic limbs were assessed for quantification of perfusion. LDPI images were analysed by two independent observers blinded to the experimental group and averaged. Limb perfusion was expressed as the ratio of the flux value of the ischemic (left) limb relative to the value of the contralateral non-ischemic (right) limb in the same mouse and presented as average perfusion units (PU).

There is great interest in developing novel medical therapies for the leg symptoms of PAD. Recent efforts have focused on stimulating development of new blood vessels within the leg through angiogenesis or by encouraging the remodelling of existing small vessels into improved collateral channels (arteriogenesis). Promising results for novel treatments, such as viral vectors carrying angiogenesis promoting agents and stem cells, in pre-clinical models of PAD have not been consistently replicated in large clinical trials 9-12 . In patients that have PAD, atherosclerosis-associated arterial narrowing develops gradually over many years allowing the legs to adjust to the gradual decrease in blood flow through compensatory mechanisms within the blood vessels and muscle fibres 13 . In contrast, the most commonly used animal model for initial testing of novel therapies for PAD is a model of acute blood supply interruption through ligation or excision of the femoral artery (referred to here as the 1-stage hind limb ischemia (HLI) model) 14, 15 . Previous studies report that the ligation and excision of the femoral artery in the 1-stage model leads to increased fluid shear stress within the limb collateral arteries resulting in altered gene expression patterns through shear stress responsive elements which promote arterio-and angio-genesis [16] [17] [18] . Hind limb blood supply in this 1-stage model therefore usually naturally recovers over a period of approximately 4 weeks 15 . This model does not therefore simulate the clinical presentation of PAD. Patients typically present with a history of acute exacerbation of chronic symptoms of leg pain on walking and have ongoing ischemic symptoms. The 1-stage HLI model may therefore not be an ideal model to study therapeutic angiogenesis and arteriogenesis 14, 19 . Another approach to inducing HLI is the placement of an ameroid constrictor around the femoral artery to induce gradual occlusion 16, 20, 21 . Previous studies suggest that this approach leads to mild ischemia 20 and that blood flow recovery occurs within 2-3 weeks 16, 21 . Furthermore, previous pre-clinical PAD research has mainly focused on assessing hind limb blood supply with limited assessment of ambulatory ability 14, 15 . On the other hand, the assessment of novel treatments in PAD patients usually involves measures of walking ability using treadmill or corridor walking tests 22, 23 . There is therefore a need for an increased focus on functional tests of the limb within clinically-relevant rodent models.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 73, "end": 76, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 77, "end": 80, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 81, "end": 84, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 85, "end": 88, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 616, "end": 622, "text": "9-12 .", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1138, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1447, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1452, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1457, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1916, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2052, "end": 2055, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2056, "end": 2059, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2191, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2346, "end": 2349, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2512, "end": 2515, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We hypothesised that the limb ischemia produced by the current 1-stage HLI model would be more severe and sustained if the model was modified to include an initial more slowly progressive arterial narrowing over 14 days prior to the induction of acute ischemia (i.e. a 2-stage model).

These markers of systemic inflammation increased in response to HLI in both models examined. Twenty eight days after HLI induction, the concentrations of circulating cytokines were similar in the two models studied. Gastrocnemius muscle samples obtained from the 2-stage HLI model had marked neutrophilic infiltration. It has been previously reported that inflammatory cells accumulate in hypoxic tissues and promote angiogenesis 58 . It is possible that the systemic concentrations of cytokines were not reflective of the level of inflammation within the hind limb. Markers of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in gastrocnemius tissue, such as CD31 and \u03b1-SMC, were found to be less evident in the 2-stage than the 1-stage HLI model. Furthermore, gastrocnemius VEGF and VEGF-R2 protein levels and amount of total plasma NO metabolites were significantly lower in the 2-stage than 1-stage HLI model. VEGF promotes angiogenesis 59 through binding to VEGF-R2 60 expressed on endothelial cells 61 . VEGF induces the release of NO 62 thereby promoting microvascular perfusion and endothelial progenitor cell mobilization [63] [64] [65] . Endothelial cell derived microRNA, such as miR-16, have also been implicated in controlling angiogenesis through inhibiting Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI)-\u03b1, an important regulator of eNOS phosphorylation 66 . It appears likely that the low levels of pro-angiogenic markers in the 2-stage HLI model reflect less activation of endothelium-dependent pro-angiogenesis signalling pathways which were stimulated by collateral flow within the 1-stage model. Shear stress promotes arteriogenesis by stimulating remodelling of collaterals 67, 68 . Endothelial cells transduce changes in shear stress into intracellular signals which promote expression of a distinct set of genes which can control the response to ischemia [69] [70] [71] . Previous studies suggest that increased shear stress promotes phosphorylation and upregulation of mechano-sensors, such as TRPV4 [72] [73] [74] [75] . It was postulated that the distinct ways of inducing HLI in the two models studied might be reflected in different TRPV4 expression. Mice subjected to 2-stage HLI had lower expression of TRPV4 compared to those undergoing 1-stage HLI. Furthermore, in the 2-stage HLI model, there was no change in TRPV4 protein levels after ameroid placement, suggesting that ameroid constriction is a gradual process that does not lead to shear stress changes capable of stimulating mechano-sensors like TRPV4. These findings also suggest that 2-stage HLI results in more limited collateral flow than the 1-stage approach.

This study suggests the novel 2-stage model has clear advantages over the 1-stage model since ischemia is more severe and prolonged and does not naturally recover making it suitable to access the longer term effects of potential therapies. The study also has some limitations. These include the absence of a detailed time course of the genes and proteins assessed and the absence of a definitive test of the role of shear stress response elements in the differences in the models found.

Membranes were stripped and re-blotted with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (anti-GAPDH, 1:10,000; Abcam, UK) and used for densitometry quantification. The raw data were analysed by normalising the relevant protein's band intensity to the mean intensity of the housekeeping protein GAPDH. The final data were represented as arbitrary units (A.U.). (2020) 10:3449 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020The 2-stage HLI model showed reduced ambulatory ability compared to controls. (A) Treadmill test (TMT) performance was reduced in the 2-stage Hind limb ischemia (HLI) model compared to the 1-stage HLI model as well as the sham controls. The 2-stage HLI group had a shorter total distance travelled 1 week after ischemia induction and by the end of the experiment period compared to sham controls. The 2-stage HLI model showed a significant reduction in total distance travelled on the treadmill compared to the 1-stage HLI group at 4 weeks. Data represented as mean \u00b1 SME, and analysed by repeated measures two-way ANOVA. (B) The 2-stage HLI model showed reduced voluntary activity in the Open field (OF) test. The image shows the tracking image generated by the motion tracking software. (C) The total distance travelled by mice subjected to 2-stage HLI on day 28 after ischemia induction were significantly less than their sham controls. (D) The 2-stage HLI group showed significantly lower total time in motion and (E), velocity of movement in the OF arena compared to their sham controls. (F) HLI led to impaired mechanical allodynia. The pressure sensitivities of the various experimental groups were assessed using the pain application measurement device (PAM). Assessment of mechanical allodynia by PAM showed that both the 1-stage HLI and the 2-stage HLI models had significantly increased sensitivity to pressure compared their sham controls at the end of the study period.
