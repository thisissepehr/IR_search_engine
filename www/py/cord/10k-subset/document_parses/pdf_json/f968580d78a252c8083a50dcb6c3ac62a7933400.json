Skipping the effector stage is a simplifying assumption, yet it is partially justified by the facts that newly created memory cells are descendants of the original naive or memory cells and, when proliferation rates are similar between lineages, the number of new memory cells generated during an infection may be correlated with the number of activated precursor cells (De Boer et al. 2003; Kaech and Ahmed 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 731, "end": 756, "text": "(Chapdelaine et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 757, "end": 777, "text": "Kennedy et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 778, "end": 793, "text": "Ku et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 794, "end": 813, "text": "Welsh et al. 2004b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1580, "text": "(De Boer et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1602, "text": "Kaech and Ahmed 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Antigen-Induced Memory Generation and Passive Attrition"}, {"text": "We consider scenarios in which all lineages proliferate, one lineage proliferates to become the majority of the memory compartment, or one lineage proliferates but remains a minority.

Yet, by comparing the results of different repertoire sizes, we have shown that the trends we identified also hold for larger compartments and larger numbers of lineages. Therefore, these characteristics should scale to biologically relevant cases in which lineages with 10 3 to 10 6 cells reside in a memory CD8 + T-cell compartment with 10 7 to 10 10 cells. For larger compartments, the 50-fold expansion we assume during antigen-induced proliferation substantially underestimates the >1,000-fold expansion seen experimentally (Blattman et al. 2002) . Thus, the final distribution changes we observe with small numbers may underestimate true shifts, and greater expansion will likely exacerbate the differences between immunity loss due to antigen-induced proliferation and passive attrition versus active attrition. We also assume that only two lineages (or two lineage groups) compete for proliferation signals at a given time to make computation times feasible. We discern the dynamics of multiple competing lineages by using an \"us versus them\" approach that pits each lineage against the rest of the memory compartment. This process can be cumbersome with a large number of lineages, but the attrition and proliferation models can nevertheless determine how multiple lineages interact to refill a lymphopenic compartment. Furthermore, the analytical models hold for any lineage and compartment size; thus, with faster numerical approaches or platforms, the final-size probability distributions can be calculated for more biologically realistic population numbers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 646, "text": "(Blattman et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To validate these models requires experimental data that measure absolute cell numbers in every lineage and the total number of memory CD8 + T-cells in the host.

This could be modeled using dynamic proliferation weights that drop to zero when the peptides become recognized as self. Models like these might also apply to other immunological systems.
