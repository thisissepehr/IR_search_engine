Using the Latin Hypercube Sampling technique [2] , we generated samples of size n = 1000 in which each parameter is treated as a random variable and assigned a probability function. In this technique, the parameters are uniformly distributed and sampled within their respective ranges. The reproduction number was uniformly sampled from the range [1.5, 2.5] (values found in references [3, 4] ), and the rate of de novo resistant emergence was sampled from the range [0.018, 0.072] (values taken from references [5, 6] ). The corresponding range for the conversion rate of resistant strains was computed using the constraint that the fraction of treated individuals hosting resistance, which undergoes compensatory mutations and subsequently generates resistant strains with high fitness, lies between 1/5000 and 1/500 [7, 8] .",

These simulations, illustrated in Figure 1 , correspond to Figure 2 in the main text, and show that a substantially larger stockpile is required when treatment exceeds a certain level in a constant treatment strategy. This is due to the wide spread of highly transmissible resistance under high pressure of antiviral drugs, which in turn leads to a larger number of total infections. We further ran simulations for the optimal time t * in an adaptive treatment strategy (using a sample of size n = 100), to determine the sensitivity of the results on the parameters variation in minimizing the total number of infections. The results of this sensitivity analysis are illustrated in Figure 2 , with different sizes of stockpile (8.5%, 12%, 25%), when initial treatment levels (0%, 25%) change to 80% at time t * . Regardless of the level of stockpiles, the results show that aggressive treatment should be implemented with shorter delay after the onset of the outbreak as the basic reproduction number increases. However, the implementation of intensive treatment requires a significantly longer delay for higher initial treatment levels as the reproduction number decreases.",

The solid curves pass through the median values of data points for t * , and each box contains 50% of data points between the first and third quartiles of the sampling distribution. The remaining 50% of data points are represented by whiskers. Initial treatment levels in adaptive antiviral strategy before transition time t * are: (a,c,e) 0%; (b,d,f) 25%. The treatment level changes to 80% at time t * , and levels of stockpile are: (a,b) 8.5%; (c,d) 12%; (e,f) 25%.",
