Such reassortment occurred in 2009, when the novel, swine-origin pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A[H1N1]pdm09) emerged and spread globally, resulting in the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century [1] [2] [3] [4] . Characterization of immunity to this virus revealed little antigenic seroreactivity with contemporary seasonal influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A[H1N1]) [5] , relatively few conserved B-cell epitopes within the hemagglutinin (HA) protein [6] , and little or no preexisting neutralizing antibody in unexposed children or adults aged <60 years [7] [8] [9] . In contrast, preexisting memory CD4 + T cells, including cells directed against epitopes within the HA protein, were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of subjects not previously exposed to A(H1N1)pdm09 [6, [10] [11] [12] [13] . Thus, this pandemic offered a unique opportunity to study CD4 + Tcell responses with an influenza virus strain that would simultaneously induce naive and memory CD4 + T cells without large amounts of coexisting B-cell-mediated immunity.",

How this competition will affect the specificity of CD4 + T-cell responses is unknown. While the typical seasonal trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) is enriched for HA, it also contains the more conserved internal viral proteins, such as nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M1) [14, 15] . Thus, both repeated infections and vaccinations may lead to a dominance of T cells specific for peptide epitopes conserved among virus strains. While recent studies examining the T-cell repertoire in humans have shown broad reactivity to diverse viral proteins [10, 16, 17] , few studies have examined the distribution of reactivity among conserved and novel epitopes.",

Lack of consensus may be due to inadequate subject numbers, variable levels of baseline anti-influenza immunity in study populations, or the use of recall antigens that do not elicit the full repertoire of influenza-reactive cells. Knowledge of the relationship between CD4 + T cells and the development of a neutralizing antibody response following administration of TIV is even more limited, with the few studies addressing this question failing to find a correlation between these parameters [12, 20] , except when an adjuvanted influenza A virus subtype H5N1 vaccine was used [29] .",

CD4 + T-cell responses at all time points were quantified following restimulation with HA-conserved and NP/M1 peptide pools. A pool containing A(H3N2) peptides not present in the vaccine and tetanus toxoid were included as controls. Figure 2 shows the number of interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-producing CD4 + T cells per 10 6 CD8-and CD56-depleted PBMCs in both the cohort including all subjects (A-C) and only those subjects with preexisting microneutralization titers of <40 (D-F). Reactivity to the HA-conserved pool (Figure 2A and 2D) and NP/M1 pool ( Figure 2B and 2E) was clearly detected following vaccination. When postvaccination responses were compared to baseline using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, these responses were statistically significant at all time points. The readily detectable responses to NP and M1 are likely the result of contaminating internal viral proteins within the vaccine, as has been demonstrated in previous studies [14, 15] and as we have confirmed in this vaccine, using a Western blot for NP (data not shown). No significant increases in responses to tetanus toxoid or the A(H3N2) divergent pool were observed (Supplementary Figure 1) . These results provide strong evidence that subunit vaccines elicit CD4 + T cells specific for influenza virus epitopes. In this study cohort, there was no effect of age or body mass index on either the maximum microneutralization titer achieved ( Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B ) or the overall expansion of CD4 + T cells (Supplementary Figure 2C and 2D) , although the preexisting immunity of older adults may have biased the results of the age analysis.",

To evaluate this, the maximal change in the \"total\" CD4 + response (sum of the HA/NA unique, HA-conserved, and NP/M1-specific CD4 + T-cell responses) was determined for each subject and plotted against the maximum or fold-increase in neutralizing antibody titer. As demonstrated in Figure 3A and 3B, there was a highly significant correlation between CD4 + T-cell expansion and both the maximum (r = 0.53, P < .0001) and fold-increase in (r = 0.46, P = .0004) microneutralization titer. The above correlations were also statistically significant when the maximal fold-increase in CD4 + T cells was quantified and compared to the neutralizing antibody titer, when the antibody titer was quantified using HAI, and when all subjects with an HAI of \u226510 at baseline were excluded from the analysis (data not shown). In contrast, there was no detectable correlation between gains in neutralizing antibody titers and the number of influenza virus-reactive CD4 + T cells present before vaccination ( Figure 3C and 3D) . We conclude from this that expansion of CD4 + T cells rather than the baseline number of influenza virus-reactive cells correlates with and predicts the development of a neutralizing antibody response following A (H1N1)pdm09 vaccination, a result that is consistent with the idea that CD4 + T-cell help may limit the antibody response to pandemic influenza vaccines.",

            "text": "Under physiologic conditions, antigen-specific B cells primarily internalize antigen via the immunoglobulin receptor and recruit CD4 + T cells via the major histocompatibility complex class II restricted display of peptides from this immunoglobulin-mediated event [35, 36] . If influenza virus proteins within the vaccine are not aggregated, other viral proteins will not be internalized by HA-specific B cells. This will lead to the selective presentation of HA-derived epitopes by HA-specific B cells. In this scenario, B cells producing neutralizing antibody will only recruit help from HA-specific CD4 + T cells [37] . Clearly, the sampling limitations in humans preclude direct examination of B-cell antigen presentation within the draining lymph node following intramuscular vaccination. Thus, to evaluate the role of CD4 + T-cell specificity in neutralizing antibody production, we examined correlations between the neutralizing antibody response and expansion of IFN-\u03b3producing CD4 + T cells specific for peptides within either the HA-conserved or NP/M1 pools. Figure 4 demonstrates that there was a significant correlation between neutralizing antibody response and expansion of both HA-specific ( Figure 4A and 4B) and NP/M1-specific ( Figure 4C and 4D) CD4 + T cells, with the strongest correlation seen when HA reactivity was examined. Figure 5 represents the subjects grouped by degree of CD4 + T-cell expansion. Vaccine recipients with the largest CD4 + T-cell response increases consistently had the greatest gains in neutralizing antibody production. Interestingly, subjects with a >100 spot increase in CD4 + T cells specific for peptides within the conserved HA pool had a higher geometric mean titer of and fold-increase in neutralizing antibody production ( Figure 5A and 5C) when compared to the similar NP/M1 group ( Figure 5B and 5D) , suggesting that HA-specific B cells may display a limited repertoire of peptides derived primarily from HA and thus may preferentially recruit cognate help from HA-specific CD4 + T cells. However, even in this scenario, CD4 + T cells specific for proteins such as NP and M1 that are stimulated in the lymph node may be able to promote antibody responses through noncognate interactions via the provision of cytokines [38] .",

Furthermore, increases in CD4 + T cells specific for peptides within the HA-conserved pool predicted the antibody titer better than NP/M1 responses.

This positive relationship between CD4 + T cells and antibody responses was most apparent when looking at CD4 + T-cell responses directed against conserved peptide epitopes within the HA protein of the A/California/07/09 virus. On the basis of these results, we postulate that activation of CD4 + T cells following vaccination may be one of the limiting factors for neutralizing antibody production following pandemic influenza vaccination.",

            "text": "As there is great interest in defining biomarkers that will predict success in vaccination, our studies evaluated whether prevaccination levels of influenza virus-specific CD4 + T-cell reactivity predicted the magnitude of the neutralizing antibody response. We did not observe any correlation between these parameters but instead found a correlation between CD4 + Tcell expansion and the titer of neutralizing antibody produced. This suggests that, following vaccination, only a subset of influenza virus-reactive cells are able to be recruited into the draining lymph nodes and expand, leading the cells that ultimately reenter the circulating pool to be most indicative of the help available for the antibody response. The effect this has on CD4 + T-cell memory will be important to address in future studies. Our results contrast with what was recently reported in the study by Wilkinson et al [39] , in which greater baseline circulating numbers of influenza virus-specific CD4 + T cells were protective against development of severe disease in an influenza challenge model. One potential reason for this difference is that the study by Wilkinson et al predominantly examined the role of effector CD4 + T cells that exerted their function prior to either viral clearance or the production of neutralizing antibody, possibly via cytolytic activity. This contrasts with our study, which considered the neutralizing antibody produced in response to vaccine challenge. Additionally, more CD4 + T cells may be able to be recruited into the immune response following infection, because of a greater abundance and diversity of epitopes displayed by antigenpresenting cells. Our ability to use peripheral blood CD4 + T-cell reactivity to predict future vaccine-induced B-cell responses is likely to require a more refined definition of epitopes recruited by vaccination and a better understanding of the subsets of CD4 + T cells that can participate in extrafollicular and germinal center responses to vaccine components. Further, it is possible that the observed relationship between CD4 + T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses may be the result of an overall more robust vaccine response in some individuals. Future efforts to selectively boost CD4 + T-cell responses will help to confirm the causal relationship between these parameters.",

It is interesting that the strongest correlation observed was between expansion of HA-specific CD4 + T cells and the neutralizing antibody response, although the distinction between NP/M1-and HA-specific expansion and the antibody response that we detected was modest. Both concurrent expansion of HA-reactive CD4 + T cells and cells specific for the NP/M1 pool and the inclusion of M1 peptides within the NP pool, as M1 associates with the viral surface glycoproteins [40] and may be taken up with HA by B cells, may have lessened our ability to detect a potential linkage between B-cell and T-cell specificities. If HA-specific B cells do have preferential access to limited viral proteins, vaccine development efforts that focus the CD4 + T-cell response on HA-derived epitopes may improve the neutralizing antibody response following vaccination.",

            "text": "One of the challenges to vaccination against pandemic influenza is that the viral protein composition of the next pandemic strain cannot be predicted [41, 42] . The failure to detect CD4 + T-cell responses to novel epitopes in the current study suggests either that these epitopes are poorly immunogenic or that naive cells fail to successfully compete with the more abundant and rapidly recruited memory cells. Further studies involving individuals who are now primed with A(H1N1) pdm09 will help clarify the overall immunogenicity of these peptides and the effect of competing memory T cells on naive CD4 + T-cell expansion and response kinetics. For antibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09, there may have been enough conserved HA epitopes to promote antibody responses, but for more distant viruses conserved HA epitopes may be quite limited, possibly resulting in a correspondingly low neutralizing antibody response. This could explain the disparity between the robust responses to a single dose of A(H1N1) pdm09 vaccine [43, 44] as compared to A(H5N1) vaccine, to which responses are modest [45, 46] . If future studies substantiate the link between HA-specific CD4 + T cells and anti-influenza virus neutralizing antibody production, efforts to enrich the CD4 + memory population with T cells specific for potentially cross-reactive HA epitopes by prepriming with peptidebased vaccines or novel HA constructs [47] may increase the recruitment of HA-specific CD4 + T cells on challenge with divergent HA proteins. Such a strategy could promote a more broadly cross-reactive and rapid response to novel strains of influenza virus, increasing pandemic preparedness by providing stand-alone protection while allowing dose-sparing efforts to facilitate rapid deployment of limited vaccine stocks to the population in the event of a pandemic.",
