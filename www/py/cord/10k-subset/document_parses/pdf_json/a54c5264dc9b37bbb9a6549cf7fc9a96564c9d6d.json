            "text": "The highest incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is in southeast China, including Taiwan. Many side effects have been observed following radiation therapy with chemotherapy; hence, exploring new treatment modalities for NPC is an important future direction. Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is an endogenous heptapeptide hormone and important component of the renin-angiotensin system that acts through both the Mas receptor and AT2 receptor, exhibiting antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic properties in cancer cells. However, the anti-cancer activity of Ang-(1-7) related to autophagy in NPC remains largely debated. The effects and signaling pathway(s) involved in the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis in NPC were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Ang-(1-7) inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC-TW01 cells. Ang-(1-7) induced autophagy by increasing the levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II and by enhancing p62 degradation via activation of the Beclin-1/Bcl-2 signaling pathway with involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p38 pathways in vitro study. In addition, pre-treatment with Ang-(1-7) inhibited tumor growth in NPC xenografts by inducing autophagy, suggesting a correlation between PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition and the abovementioned anticancer activities. However, no autophagy was observed following Ang-(1-7) post-treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that Ang-(1-7) plays a novel role in autophagy downstream signaling pathways in NPC, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for alleviation the incidence of NPC and preventive treatment of recurrent NPC.",

The peak age of NPC incidence is 50-60 years [2] . The most important risk factors for NPC are genetic predisposition, Epstein-Barr viral infection, and dietary and environmental factors [3] . NPC is a prevalent disease in Taiwan [4] . Radiotherapy or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment [4] ; however, severe side effects, such as sensorineural hearing loss, mucositis, dry mouth, and dietary problems, as well as the limitations of conventional treatments have led to the widespread application of complementary and/or alternative medicines. Furthermore, the local recurrence rate of NPC after initial radiotherapy is approximately 10%. Re-irradiating the same field may cause potentially serious side effects and complications. The treatment of recurrent NPC remains a challenging clinical problem [5, 6] . Therefore, it is necessary to identify new therapeutic methods for NPC and recurrent NPC.",

            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an endocrine system that plays a central role in cardiovascular and renal physiology by regulating blood pressure and sodium balance [7] . One member of the Balternative RAS axis^is the angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] peptide, which is generated by subsequent cleavage of angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Ang-(1-7) binds to G protein-coupled receptors, namely, the Mas receptor (MasR), which activates distinct signaling pathways that lead to cellular effects [8] . In cancer, Ang-(1-7) is an anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic molecule that mediates its effects by binding to MasR [9, 10] . In vitro studies on lung cancer cells have confirmed the antiproliferative function of Ang-(1-7) via MasR. Ang-(1-7) inhibits cell migration and invasion by inactivating the PI3K/Akt, p38 and JNK signaling pathways [11, 12] . In vivo studies have indicated that administration of Ang-(1-7) reduces lung and prostate tumor xenografts [13, 14] , as well as prostate cancer metastasis [15] . Furthermore, a recent report showed that Ang-(1-7) downregulated the AT1 receptor (AT1R) mRNA level, upregulated AT2 receptor and MasR mRNA levels and p38-MAPK phosphorylation, and suppressed communication between H22 hepatocellular carcinoma and endothelial cells, which may provide a novel and promising approach for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [16] . As noted above, Ang-(1-7) may promote tumor cell death by regulating the stoichiometry of the receptors and subsequently altering their signaling. Moreover, autophagy (type II programmed cell death) is a major intracellular pathway via the degradation and recycling of proteins, ribosomes and organelles [17] . Autophagy as a novel cancer therapy is an effective approach used to alleviate treatment resistance in apoptosis-defective tumor cells [18] . Ang-(1-7) acts as a tumor suppressor, making it a promising therapeutic target.",

Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 2 min and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for 20 min and washed twice with PBS. Non-invasive cells were removed with a cotton swab. Cell numbers were counted using phase-contrast microscopy, and the mean value was used as the number of invasive cells. The experiment was repeated three times. Images measured using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software were used to calculate the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Invasion suppression rate = [(penetration cell number in the control group \u2212 penetration cell number in the treated group)/penetration cell number in the control group] \u00d7 100%.",

Beclin-1 was upregulated at 24 h and 72 h, whereas Bcl-2 protein levels were lower at 72 h, in 0.2 \u03bcM Ang-(1-7)-treated cells relative to the control cells (0 \u03bcM) (Fig. 3a, b) . We also knocked down Bcl-2 to examine the interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2, which is believed to play a regulatory role in autophagy. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bcl-2 was performed to assess whether Bcl-2 modulates Beclin-1 and LC3-II expression under Ang-(1-7) exposure. Bcl-2 knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting. The levels of Beclin-1 and LC3-II were increased significantly in cells treated with 0.2 \u03bcM Ang-(1-7) and Bcl-2 siRNA (Fig. 3e, f) . These findings suggest that Ang-(1-7) activates autophagy in NPC-TW01 cells by modulating the Beclin-1/Bcl-2 complex. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was significantly higher following treatment with 0.2 \u03bcM Ang-(1-7) compared with the controls at 24 h and 72 h, and LC3-II expression was lower in the Ang-(1-7) plus A779 coadministration and A779 alone groups than in the Ang-(1-7) alone group at 72 h (Fig. 3a,  b) . In reverse, p62 expression was lower in the 0.2 \u03bcM Ang-(1-7)-treated cultures than in the controls at 24 h and 72 h, and the level of p62 in the Ang-(1-7) plus A779 coadministration and A779 alone groups was higher than in the Ang-(1-7) alone group at 72 h (Fig. 3a, b) . Taken together, these data suggest that autophagy is activated in NPC-TW01 cells after prolonged Ang-(1-7) treatment. We also investigated whether the effects of Ang-(1-7) on NPC-TW01 cells are mediated by phosphorylation of proteins involved in this pathway. The phosphorylation of PI3K and S6 ribosomal protein was significantly inhibited by Ang-(1-7) treatment at 24 h and 72 h. The ratios of p-AKT/AKT and p-p38/p38 were significantly decreased following Ang-(1-7) treatment at 72 h, and Ang-(1-7) also reduced p-mTOR expression, suggesting that Ang-(1-7) inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Additionally, p38 phosphorylation was affected by Ang-(1-7) treatment at 72 h. However, the results showed that A779 have an ineffective action for members of the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway (Fig. 3c, d) . Therefore, we designed two mouse models (pre-and post-treatment) to investigate whether Ang-(1-7) induces autophagy in vivo.",

Only few studies have demonstrated a regulatory function of the RAS in NPC. Wang et al. indicated that AT1R plays a significant role not only in the cell proliferation and invasion, but also in radiation resistance, of NPC cells [23] . No association was found between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 polymorphisms and the risk of NPC [24] . However, the effects of the RAS on autophagy-associated pathways in NPC remain questionable. Therefore were 2.5-fold higher than that of the AT2 receptor (Fig. S1 ).",

Our data indicate that 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM Ang-(1-7) induced a decrease in pro-caspase-3 and -9 expression, respectively, in NPC-TW01 cells. However, pro-caspase-8 expression was not affected (Fig. S3 ). In addition, the Bcl-2 inhibitor activates the autophagic pathway through the blocking interaction of Bcl-2/ Beclin1 and upregulating Beclin-1 [26] . Therefore, by examining the interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 identified by Bcl-2 siRNA transfection experiments, we found that 0.2 \u03bcM Ang-(1-7) caused autophagosome formation because of the increase in LC3-ll levels and induced autophagy via activation of the Beclin-1/Bcl-2 signaling pathway (Fig. 3e) . However, concentrations of Ang-(1-7) greater than 2.5 \u03bcM triggered NPC-TW01 cell apoptosis due to decreased pro-caspase-3 and -9 expression, confirming that Ang-(1-7) stimulates NPC cell autophagy at lower concentrations. As a downstream effector of Akt, mTOR suppresses autophagy [27, 28] . Ang-(1-7), a peptide with anti-inflammatory properties, plays an important role in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment, and inactivation of the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways may be responsible for the inhibitory effects of Ang-(1-7) [12] . In the present study, we investigated whether the effects of Ang-(1-7) in NPC-TW01 cells are mediated by these pathways by examining phosphorylation of the involved proteins. The phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, p-GSK3-\u03b2, and mTOR was inhibited by Ang-(1-7) treatment. Ang-(1-7) also reduced p38 phosphorylation, suggesting that Ang-(1-7) blocks the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p38 pathways (Fig. 3c, d) .",

In the heart, MasR mediates cardioprotection of Ang-(1-7) against angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte autophagy and cardiac remodeling by inhibiting oxidative stress [30] . Ang-(1-7) induced time-dependent upregulation in autophagic activity via LC3-II and Beclin-1 in serum-starved human aortic endothelial cells [31] . Moreover, a recent report indicated that Ang-(1-7) not only causes a significant reduction in the growth of human nasopharyngeal xenografts but also markedly decreases vessel density [19] . Ang-(1-7) may inhibit the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts in nude mice by reducing cyclooxygenase-2 [13] . In this study, we hypothesized that the regulatory function of the Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis is related to autophagy in NPC in vivo. Therefore, we established two xenograft mouse models (preand post-treatment) to evaluate tumor size and autophagy/cell death-associated proteins. A high Ang-(1-7) concentration (1 \u03bcg/kg/day) inhibited tumor size post-treatment, but a lower concentration (0.2 \u03bcg/kg/day) had no significant effect. However, the expression of autophagy-associated proteins was not affected (Fig. 4) . Therefore, we hypothesize that Ang-(1-7) may induce apoptosis by degrading pro-caspase-3 (Fig. S4 ). In contrast, our results demonstrated that both low-and high-dose Ang-(1-7) inhibited tumor proliferation pre-treatment by directly affecting tumor size and by indirectly inducing autophagy by suppressing the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Figs. 5 and 6). Ang-(1-7) exerted its tumor inhibition effect at a five fold higher concentration post-treatment compared with pre-treatment, suggesting that Ang-(1-7) is more efficient as a preventive than a curative agent in vivo because it caused autophagic activity in NPC.",

Ang- (1-7) , at a dose of 20 mg daily, was well-tolerated in a phase II trial for the treatment of patients with metastatic sarcoma [36] .

Furthermore, while the treatment results for the primary NPC have been encouraging; management of recurrent NPC has been challenging [5, 6] . Therefore, Ang-(1-7) represents a novel preventive agent against NPC via its autophagic effects and may aid in the development of other protective therapeutics against recurrent NPC in the future. Moreover, our results suggest that Ang-(1-7) may provide a preventive treatment in NPC with high risk factors associated with family history, salt-cured fish and meet of diet, smoking or alcohol exposures and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus. However, Ang-(1-7) may exert favorable preventive and antitumor activity of NPC or recurrent NPC in clinical, further clinical investigations are needed in our team.",
