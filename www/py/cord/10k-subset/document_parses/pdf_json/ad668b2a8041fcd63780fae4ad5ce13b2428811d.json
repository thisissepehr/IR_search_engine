Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings.

We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay.

With origins in the insurance claims and actuarial literature [4, 5] , nowcast models aim to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported events (e.g. insurance claims, disease cases) at any given time based on an incomplete set of reports. In public health settings, nowcasting approaches have been explored for AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s [6] [7] [8] as a consequence of the long incubation period from HIV infection until development of AIDS. More recently, nowcasting has been applied to infectious disease outbreaks such as foodborne illness outbreaks [9, 10] . These studies draw principally on survival analysis and actuarial techniques to model the reporting delay and draw inferences based on historical patterns. A majority of studies have strictly focused on modeling the reporting delay distribution-a legacy of the actuarial techniques giving rise to many of these approaches-and generally neglect a key feature of outbreaks: that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases, a fact that creates potentially strong autocorrelation in the true number of cases over short time intervals. In other words, the infectious disease transmission process provides an additional signal of the number of cases to be expected in the near future that has not been included in common methods such as the reverse-time hazard model [11, 12] and the chain ladder method [13] , which model the probability of delays in case reporting and consider the number of cases at successive time points as independent. However, proposals to extend the chain ladder approach to state-space models that account for temporal relationships in reporting have existed in the literature since the development of these techniques [13] [14] [15] and have been applied in at least one infectious disease context [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 165, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 166, "end": 168, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 453, "end": 456, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 457, "end": 460, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 665, "end": 668, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 669, "end": 672, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1458, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1462, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1495, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1836, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1841, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1846, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1916, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The development of nowcast models is promising for disease surveillance, but equally important is the need to identify and scrutinize the mechanisms by which these approaches are successful in accurately predicting true case reports and, on the other hand, underperform.

To wit, in this investigation we find that nowcasting is especially challenging when the proportion of cases reported the week they occur (delay 0) is low and reporting delays are highly variable; we know of no investigations that specifically identify models that perform well in these commonly occurring circumstances. As a result, the characteristics of robust and broadly-applicable models are difficult to identify. Additionally, several previous models have largely focused on providing point estimates of the number of cases.

We introduce Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (NobBS), a simple and flexible generalized Bayesian model and associated software package for nowcasting infectious diseases. We demonstrate the robustness of this approach in two very different disease surveillance contexts and identify the conditions that favor its application, especially when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying. Specifically, NobBS allows for both uncertainty in the delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve, producing smooth, time-correlated estimates of cases. We demonstrate that NobBS performs well for weekly nowcasts of (1) dengue cases in Puerto Rico and (2) influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in the United States, requiring no disease-specific parameterization despite the two pathogens being very different (vector-borne vs. directly transmitted) and exhibiting substantially different reporting delays. Lastly, we test NobBS against a previously developed Bayesian nowcast method for surveillance data [9] and find that NobBS outperforms this established method for both diseases and multiple time periods. In particular, we show that while point estimates of the models are similar when time-to-report distributions are relatively fixed over time, NobBS improves the estimation of uncertainty and accommodates temporal variation in delay probabilities. Our investigation aims to provide deeper insights into these different nowcast approaches and describe the practical implementation of NobBS.

Generally, the approach learns from historical information on cases reported at multiple delays (e.g. no delay, 1-week delay, 2-week delay, etc.) from the week of case onset to estimate the reporting delay probability at each delay and the relationship between case counts from week-to-week, and uses this relationship to predict the number of not-yet-reported cases in the present using a log-linear model for the number of cases at each week t and each delay d. We tested this approach, NobBS, using two different infectious disease surveillance data sources: dengue surveillance in Puerto Rico, and national notifications of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States. Using all of the  available data on case reporting delays up to the point of prediction, weekly dengue nowcasts  were estimated for the time period December 23, 1991 through November 29, 2010 (989  weeks), and weekly ILI nowcasts were produced over the period June 30, 2014 through September 25, 2017 (170 weeks) . For comparison, we generated weekly nowcasts over the same periods using an existing Bayesian approach by H\u00f6hle and der Heiden (2014), here referred to as the HH approach [9] . Briefly, this approach frames the nowcast problem in the context of survival modeling (specifically, a reverse-time discrete hazard model) and estimates the delay distribution to obtain the total number of cases each week at each time t. We chose this approach as a comparator because it is the most established and implementable approach, with an existing R package and the most cited in disease surveillance contexts [9] . To leverage a large amount of historical data to fit the nowcast model while also having a large window over which to assess nowcasts, we used a 104-week (approximately 2-y) moving window dengue and a 27-week (approximately 6-mo) moving window for ILI and tested the sensitivity to window size to inform model implementation. Our primary outcome metric to assess nowcast performance was the logarithmic score, a proper score that evaluates the probability assigned to the observed outcome rather than error associated with a point prediction. For purposes of discussion, we reported the exponentiated form of the mean logarithmic score (the geometric mean of the assigned probabilities) to provide a metric on the scale of 0 (no certainty of the outcome) to 1 (complete certainty of the outcome). In addition, we estimated other metrics describing the performance of point estimates (mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative root mean square error (rRMSE)) and the 95% prediction interval (PI) coverage, and of these, focus on comparing the rRMSE and 95% PI coverage across approaches.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1402, "end": 1405, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1830, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 916, "end": 1228, "text": "Using all of the  available data on case reporting delays up to the point of prediction, weekly dengue nowcasts  were estimated for the time period December 23, 1991 through November 29, 2010 (989  weeks), and weekly ILI nowcasts were produced over the period June 30, 2014 through September 25, 2017 (170 weeks)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Figs 1 and 2 show weekly dengue and ILI nowcasts for NobBS and the HH approach over multiple seasons for both diseases.

Hence, variations of autoregressive models are common in disease forecasting [19, 20] . Indeed, a recently published study describes a similar approach to NobBS [16] , proposing the same model structure (an adaptation of the historic chain-ladder approach) and similar priors (namely, a first-order random walk on the underlying distribution of cases), finding that this approach performed well for two diseases. Two key differences in model structure are that NobBS parameterizes the delay distribution as a Dirichlet as opposed to a random walk, to model the underlying delay distribution as a probability vector, and omits a model intercept. We also aimed to identify and deconstruct the features that contribute to good performance, comparing to a benchmark approach and testing the robustness of NobBS to multiple delay distributions, different moving window sizes, and accuracy metrics.
