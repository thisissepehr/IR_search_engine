To initiate competition binding experiments, the SB80 (concentration of A3A-E72A at which 80% of the tracer is bound) was calculated from the Kd data.12 Stock solutions (10 mM) of competitor oligonucleotides in molecular biology grade water were serially diluted into assay buffer from 250 \u00b5M to 200 pM with constant protein (SB80) and fluorescent tracer (15 nM).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "(mid), and minimum (min) signal values were distributed by column in a standard interleaved-signal 384 well format.
