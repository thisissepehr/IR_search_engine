He developed fever (up to 39.5\u00b0C) with fatigue at the end of his US stay, and returned on 2 September to the Czech Republic, where he was hospitalized (Internal Department of the University Hospital in Ostrava-Odry) on 3 September with fever, fatigue, anorexia, moderate laryngotracheitis, dizziness, insomnia, and bradypsychism. Laboratory tests showed a slightly increased ALT (1.15), while other results were normal (AST, urea, creatinine, blood cell counts, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein). After 3 days he was transferred, due to his psychic symptoms, to the Neurology Department at the district hospital in Novy\u00b4Jic\u02c7\u0131\u00b4n. There he revealed fever (up to 39\u00b0C), fatigue, anorexia, blurred speech, and a marked bradypsychism. No typical clinical signs of meningitis were observed. Laboratory tests were normal (blood, urine) but the cerebrospinal fluid showed elevated cell count (40/3, predominantly lymphocytes); protein was 0.78 g/l, glucose 2.8 g/l. EEG demonstrated a slow bifrontal theta-delta activity, and CT of the brain a slight internal and external hydrocephalus, senile atrophy, but no specific lesions. The results indicated a viral encephalitis. Serological examinations were negative for Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis, while a significant increase of antibodies neutralizing West Nile virus (plaquereduction neutralization test, PRNT) [1] was detected between the first (80% PRNT titre 1:16 at 10 days after the disease onset) and second (80% PRNT titre 1:256 at 5 weeks after the disease onset) blood serum sample. The patient, who fulfiled the CDC criteria for a confirmed West Nile fever (WNF) case definition [2] , then recovered gradually and was released from hospital on 16 September. He was found healthy during a control examination on 22 November 2002: the results of laboratory tests were all normal (urea, creatinine, ALT, AST, C-reactive protein, RBC sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, hemoglobin).",

The patient did not mention mosquito bites during his stay in USA. This is the first recorded human case of WNF imported to the Czech Republic. The case was reported to the EPIDAT Czech national epidemiological database (National Institute of Public Health, Prague). Five indigenous cases of WNF (two of them confirmed by seroconversion, three other probable -high titres of neutralizing antibodies in reconvalescent sera) were described in South Moravia in 1997 [1] . [11] ; Japan 1 case ex USA, 2005 [12] . However, this list of documented imported WNF cases might only show the tip of the iceberg.",
