In your journal, Vanspauwen et al. [2] reported six cases of hMPV detection in critically ill patients suspected of having hospital-acquired pneumonia. Recently, a case of severe hMPV lung infection in a pregnant woman was reported [3] , and hMPV was identified in 18 % of patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia in ICU [4] . It is generally known that adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease or immunocompromised patients are susceptible to hMPV infection [5] . However, we report a case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to hMPV in a healthy woman.",

Physical examination revealed bilateral crackles and right bronchial breath sounds. Blood gases were pH 7.60, PaCO 2 23 mmHg, PaO 2 43 mmHg, and HCO 3 -22 mmol/l. The patient rapidly developed severe respiratory failure unresponsive to oxygen therapy and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest radiography showed right alveolar consolidation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates. The initial PaO 2 /FiO 2 was 89 mmHg with lung ventilator protective settings [tidal volume (TV) 6 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 6 cmH 2 O adjusted for plateau pressure B30 cmH 2 O, FiO 2 0.8].",

Therefore, an expanded panel of respiratory viruses was assessed on nasopharyngeal aspiration using immunofluorescence testing, and hMPV was detected (respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzae virus type 1, 2, 3, adenovirus, and influenza virus type A and B were negative). Diagnosis of hMPV lung infection was then confirmed by molecular testing. The overall duration of mechanical ventilation was 7 days. The patient was eventually discharged from hospital on day 23.",

With the availability of new diagnostic tools and the 2009 influenza A pandemic, attention is turning to the important role of respiratory viruses as a cause of severe pneumonia. Thus, hMPV diagnosis may have been missed as a causative agent in the past, when culture-independent microbiological techniques were not in use. We detected hMPV in the lower respiratory tract during respiratory failure, but we cannot confirm the fact that the presence of hMPV represented a genuine infection. However, accumulating data argue in favor of real hMPV pathogenicity [2, 3] .",
