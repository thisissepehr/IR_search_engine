The treatment of ARDS to date is focused on the prevention of further iatrogenic damage of the lung rather than the treatment of the initial inflammatory process. Several preclinical studies have revealed a beneficial effect of iloprost on the control of pulmonary inflammation, and in a small number of patients with ARDS, iloprost treatment resulted in improved oxygenation. Therefore, we plan to conduct a large multicenter trial to evaluate the effect of iloprost on ARDS. Methods: The Therapeutic Iloprost during ARDS trial (ThIlo trial) is a multicenter, randomized, single blinded, clinical phase II trial assessing the efficacy of inhaled iloprost for the prevention of the development and progression of ARDS in critically ill patients. One hundred fifty critically ill patients suffering from acute ARDS will be treated either by nebulized iloprost or NaCl 0.9% for 5 days. Blood samples will be drawn at defined time points to elucidate the serum levels of iloprost and inflammatory markers during treatment. Mechanical ventilation will be standardized. In follow-up visits at days 28 and 90 as well as 6 months after enrollment, functional status according to the Barthel Index and a health care-related questionnaire, and frailty (Vulnerable Elders Survey) will be evaluated. The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation, defined as the ratio of PaO 2 /FiO 2 . Secondary endpoints include 90day all-cause mortality, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores during the study period up to day 90, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ventilator-associated pneumonia, delirium, ICU-acquired weakness, and discharge localization. The study will be conducted in three university ARDS centers in Germany. Discussion: The results of the ThIlo trial will highlight the anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost on early inflammatory processes during ARDS, resulting in the improvement of outcome parameters in patients with ARDS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined as pulmonary compromise with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates associated with moderate to severe hypoxemia [1] . The public health impact of ARDS is considerable, and it is estimated that approximately 75,000 cases of ARDS occur annually in Germany. The estimated mortality ranges from 26 to 51% and depends on the severity of the associated hypoxemia [2] . Patients surviving ARDS treatment also show reduced functional capacity in their everyday life following hospitalization [3, 4] . Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop further ARDS treatment strategies with a view to ultimately improving patient outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 163, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 405, "end": 408, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 532, "end": 535, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 536, "end": 538, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "The bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that can be identified on chest radiography reflect the diffuse inflammatory changes within the lung that are caused by acute inflammation within the pulmonary tissue and the alveolar space. The initial inflammatory process is induced by the activation of the innate immune response by the binding of microbial products (pathogen-associated molecular patterns [PAMPs]) or cell injury-associated endogenous molecules (danger-associated molecular patterns [DAMPs] ) to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Therefore, the common causes of ARDS are trauma, sepsis, pneumonia, blood transfusion, or aspiration into the lungs. After the initial activation of the innate immune response, innate immune effector mechanisms, such as the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), are activated, which further aggravate the alveolar injury [5] . The resulting increased permeability of the microvascular barrier results in the extravascular accumulation of protein-rich fluid that accumulates within the alveolar space. The increased permeability is also linked to the transfer of leukocytes (mostly neutrophil granulocytes) and erythrocytes into the alveolar space in ARDS, as well as to the presence of proinflammatory-regulated cytokines that increase the inflammatory burden within the lung [5] . As a result, dysregulated inflammation, the accumulation of leukocytes and platelets, and altered permeability of alveolar barriers remain the central pathophysiologic problems in ARDS [5, 6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 490, "end": 497, "text": "[DAMPs]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 876, "end": 879, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1334, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1525, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1528, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "The treatment of ARDS to date is focused on the prevention of further iatrogenic damage of the lung through lung-protective mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, and conservative fluid management [7] . Recent clinical trials have focused on the role of ventilation strategies in the prevention or treatment of ARDS using noninvasive ventilation devices or prone positioning [8, 9] . Although these strategies have shown a positive effect on patient oxygenation and symptoms, they do not interfere with the underlying pathophysiological changes of ARDS. Several interventions have tried to use a potential anti-inflammatory strategy for the treatment of the existing intra-alveolar inflammation or to intervene in the development of intra-alveolar inflammation. For this, patients were treated with aspirin, simvastatin, and surfactant, but the tested treatments failed and did not have any significant effect [10] [11] [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 206, "end": 209, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 384, "end": 387, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 388, "end": 390, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 919, "end": 923, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 924, "end": 928, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 929, "end": 933, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Considerable evidence in preclinical models shows that the use of iloprost for the treatment of ARDS and pulmonary inflammation might be of significant benefit. In small animal models, investigators showed that iloprost improves endothelial barrier function and reduces the detrimental signs of pulmonary edema [13] . It also reduces the pulmonary sequestration of leukocytes and platelets, which is a central disease mechanism underlying the development of ARDS [14] . This evidence could be transferred into different models of lung injury, showing positive evidence for the reduction of pulmonary inflammation in a pressure-induced model of lung injury [15] . The anti-inflammatory effect was attributed to the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) system and the involvement of lipoxin A4 [16] . Ras-related protein 1 (RAP-1) might also be involved in the protective role of iloprost [17] . This positive anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost on the pulmonary tissue was also demonstrated in several models of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Furthermore, IR injury can also result in ARDS and pulmonary failure. Iloprost was able to reduce this pulmonary compromise in several preclinical studies [18] [19] [20] [21] . The anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost was also shown in large animal models of lung injury using porcine models of ARDS [22] [23] [24] . Here, again, iloprost showed an anti-inflammatory effect. In addition, the shunt fraction could be reduced, which resulted in improved oxygenation and improved pulmonary dynamics, which is essential for the reinstitution of spontaneous ventilation during and following ARDS [22, 23, [25] [26] [27] . This shows that the preclinical data identified a beneficial effect of iloprost on ARDS. So far, only one study on inhaled iloprost in adult patients with ARDS has been conducted, although an application of inhaled iloprost is noted in the guidelines of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) for the treatment of ARDS [28] . The AWMF guidelines indicate that the use of ARDS can be considered, especially in patients with severe ARDS who are mechanically ventilated and not selfconsenting [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 315, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 656, "end": 660, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 780, "end": 784, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 875, "end": 879, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1193, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1198, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1203, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1338, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1343, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1348, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1629, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1630, "end": 1633, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1634, "end": 1638, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1643, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1648, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 1994, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2164, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Iloprost"}, {"text": "ThIlo is a multicenter, randomized, single blinded clinical phase II trial assessing the efficacy of inhaled iloprost in the development and progression of ARDS in critically ill patients.

Considering the pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile of iloprost, we have suggested an approach of an application of three times per day, with a dose of 20 \u03bcg, which seems to be an average dose in the trials reported up to now. The rationale behind this was that iloprost also exerts an anti- inflammatory effect that may last up to 6 h [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .

Iloprost-containing medications are well recognized epidemiologically as an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. Iloprost has been shown to exert antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory actions in small clinical observation studies and several preclinical laboratory examinations. However, the use of iloprost for the treatment of ARDS is not novel; it has been used in small studies before. Indeed, we propose in this study to systemically evaluate the application of iloprost in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to identify the potential use and benefit of iloprost in ARDS. The composite endpoint was chosen, as it is likely to be more sensitive than just 28-day mortality to detect an effect signal.

Although iloprost is used frequently in pulmonary hypertension, there are currently no data about iloprost concentration in the blood after inhalative treatment. In addition, iloprost may have a positive effect on lung compliance during acute ARDS as well as during resolution, since it has been shown to have a lasting positive effect on fibrosis in the lung and other tissues in animal models [34, 35] . In one-lung ventilation, iloprost seems to reduce intrapulmonary shunts, resulting in better oxygenation [36, 37] . In this context, the analysis of ventilator-free days or time on ECMO may reveal important information. Further on, intravenous application of iloprost may improve microcirculation, resulting in better kidney recovery in patients with sepsis [37, 38] . Patients with ARDS frequently show multiorgan failure. Therefore, the comparison of incidence and time frame for extracorporeal therapy may give insights on the effect of inhaled iloprost on microcirculation in other organs. Therefore, iloprost may positively influence the outcome of ARDS patients by at least one of the effects described above. This study will be the first to describe the effects of iloprost on inflammation, fibrosis, bleeding events, and oxygenation organ failure and anticoagulation during a continuous time frame of at least 5 days in critically ill patients.
