The interest in adaptive local immunity increased in the 1960s when it was reported hy several lahoratories that the predominant immunoglohulin (Ig) class in external hody fluids is IgA rather than IgG (1) . The secretory IgA (SIgA) molecule was found to be unique (2), both because of its polymeric structure and association with the secretory component (SC). This epithelial glycoprotein was initially termed \"transport piece\" to suggest that it might facilitate the entry of IgA into epithelial cells (3) -an interesting suggestion that would turn out to be true in an even more intricate manner than anticipated.",

Despite the absence of a satisfactory immunoregulatory explanation, a general dominance of IgA immunocytes at all secretory effector sites has now been well established for a couple of decades (5) . Moreover, the first direct evidence showing that these cells are pecuhar in that they produce polymeric {p)IgA (mainly dimers) rather than monomeric IgA, was provided by our laboratory in the early 1970s (6) ; but again the mechanism(s) driving this additional characteristic of mucosal B cells remains elusive.",

This secretory IgM (SIgM) was subsequently shown to be associated with SC and to follow the same intracellular route through secretory epithelia as SIgA (8, 9), Therefore, an epithelial transport model common for pIgA and pentameric IgM was proposed by our laboratory in 1973-74 (6, 10, 11) . A few years earlier, the \"joining\" or J chain had been identified as a unique polypeptide of approximately IS kDa shared by the two Ig polymers (12, 13). Only the heavy chains of IgA and IgM have the extra 18 amino-acid tailpiece containing a penultimate cysteine residue employed for covalent bonding of the J chain (14). Over the next decade, we obtained evidence suggesting that the J chain and transmembrane SC represent the \"lock and key\" in receptor-mediated external translocation of pIgA as well as pentameric IgM (15), a notion that has recently been firmly established (16-18). Because of its affinity to both ligands, transmembrane SC is now often referred lo as the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR).",

Therefore, non-specific innate defence mechanisms together with T-cell-mediated immunity and serum antihodies often afford sufficient mucosal protection (24). In addition, a compensatory SIgM response is regularly seen in the gut when IgA is lacking (22, 25). However, the absence of SIgA antibodies does predispose to recurrent upper airway infections, allergic disorders, autoimmunity, certain gastrointestinal infections and coeliac disease (22, 23, 26) . Also, a strikingly increased frequency of Crohn's disease has recently been observed in selective IgA deficiency (L. Hammarstrom, personal communication).",

In addition to IL-2 and IL-5, IL-6 has also been suggested to contribute to murine J chain upregulation (130, 131), whereas IL-4 appears to have an opposing effect (132). A specific enhancer sequence was recently identified 7-8 kb upstream of the start site of the gene, and inductive interactions were shown to depend on an IL-2 signal; this event triggered opening of the enhancer chromatin, allowing binding of activated STAT5 to a specific DNA element (133), Human studies Our immunohistocbemical observations suggest that also the human J chain production increases as a function of plasmacell differentiation. However, molecular information concerning the regulation of J chain expression during B-cell develop-ment in humans has been obtained mainly from leukaemic and EBV-transformed cell lines. Contrary to tbe situation in mice, these studies have suggested that transcription of the human J chain gene is initiated during early .stages of B-lineage differentiation, even before Ig production takes place (134-137). More recent data on normal cells have supported the apparent difference in J chain regulation between the two species. Thus, J chain RNA could be detected in human foetal liver hefore (i chain expression (]38), This result was confirmed and extended with haematopoietic subpopulations from human foetal and adult tissues (139) , In the bone marrow, transcripts for J chain were detected at all B-lineage stages, including the progenitor (CD19-CD34+)-and pro-B (CD19+CD34+)-cell subsets.",

In mechanistic terms, the best studied such inductive sites are the GALT structures of experimental animals, including the ileal Peyer's patches and the appendix (27, 48, 140). The chief function of GALT is to provide adaptive immune protection for the gut, but its primed effector cells also migrate to other exocrine tissues such as the upper airway mucosae and the lacrimal, salivary, and lactating mammary glands (33). Additional immune responses are presumably elicited in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), palatine tonsils and other parts of the Waldeyer's pharyngeal ring in humans, including nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) -particularly the nasopharyngeal tonsil, also called adenoids (124, 141, 142).

            "text": "tion between the appendix and the large bowel mucosa is suggested both in experimental murine colitis (249) and in human ulcerative colitis, as disctissed elsewhere (57). Notably, the immediate natural availability of environmental antigens at various secretory effector sites also appears to be reflected in the local density of Ig-producing immunocytes (238); thus, this is about seven times higher in the mucosa of the human colon (which has au enormous microbial load) than in tbe parotid and lactating mammary glands (Fig. 19) . Although MALT-related antigens theoretically should be required to provide secondary B-cell stimulation throughotit the mucosa! immune system, it is not likely that such live or dead foreign material normally gains direct access to tbe parotid and mammary gland, particularly not to tbe latter organ. Interestingly, the lacrimal gland, wbich is connected by many short ducts to an excessively aeroantigen-exposed mucosa (the conjunctiva), shows an IgA immunocyte density approaching that of the colon (Fig. 19) . In this context it is of further interest that rapid and widespread dissemination of fed antigen, presumably carried by DCs, and sequestration of circulating specific T cetts as well as iheir activation a: sites of cognate antigen presentation, were recently observed in TCR transgenic mice (54) . That study, together with previous results of adoptive B-cell transfer in syngeneic rats (250), suggests that local antigen-driven T-cell activation might provide important \"second signals\" for retention, expansion and terminal differentiation of mucosal Ig-producing immunocytes at secretory effector sites, even at a long distance from mucosal surfaces.",

            "text": "Heterogeneity in mucosal homing mechanisms Tbe molecular mechanisms tbat coordinate migration of primed B cells from GALT to secretory tissues beyond the gut are poorly defined, although they would form tbe functional basis for several desired oral vaccines. In contrast to such GALTderived dissemination of secretory immunity to extraintestinai effector sites, migration to the gut lamina propria of B cells indticed in NALT and BALT appears to be negligible in terms of generating intestinal SIgA antibodies. This notioti is based on boming results obtained by local immunization or infection experiments in rodents (251, 252) and pigs (253). On the other hand, considerable indirect evidence summarized elsewbere (142) , suggests that dissemination of primed pIgA precursor cells takes place from Waldeyer's pharyngeal lymphoid ring, or NALT, to regional secretory effector sites botb in humans and various experimental animals (Fig. 20) . In humans, sucb putative boming dichototny between the aerodigestive tract and the gut, is furthermore strongly supported by the apparent disparate distribution of sIgD+IgM-CD38\"*^ B cells, as identified by tracing of their heavy-chain Cfi-and S|i,-gene deletion (30, 176). As discussed above, this unique tonsillar centroblast subset most likely contributes significantly to the relatively frequent occurrence of IgD-produciug immunocytes uot only in the palatine tonsils and adenoids, but also iu the sahvary aud lacrimal glands as well as nasal mucosa, especially iu IgAdeficient individuals (Fig. 4) , Furthermore, activated human tonsillar B cells transferred intraperitoneally to mice with severe combined iuimunodeficiency, migrated to the lung but not to the gut mucosa (254), Putative mucosal homing molecules operating outside the gut Regionalization of the mucosal immuue system might iu part be explained by disparity in adhesion molecules expressed on the local microvascular endothelium aud lymphoid cells primed in different MALT structtires, aud perhaps by different local chemokine profiles. Animal and human studies have both demonstrated that MAdCAM-1 is shared between GALT structures and the intestinal lamina propria (Fig. 17) , and it also shows considerable expression on HEVs in mesenteric lymph nodes (194, 196) . Other, as yet unidentified, regional endotheiial determinants might be shared between the immune-inductive sites aud exocrine effector sites in the upper aerodigestive tract (Fiq. 20) . Interestingly, very little or no MAdCAM-1 can be detected on HEVs in normal human tonsils (T. Yamanaka, M. J. Brisikim, P Brandtzaeg, unpubhshed results), and this molecule appears to be abseut from regional exocrine tissues such as lungs and salivary glands, as well as from mammary glands and the human and murine uterus (19S, 255). Moreover, some evidence has been reported suggesting that a4p7 is not an important homing receptor for lymphoid cells in the airways of humans (256), mice (257) or sheep (258). Indeed, circulating specific antibody-producing cells, detected after nasal immunization in htunans, were reported to show considerable coexpression of a4p7 and L-selectin, in contrast to the results obtained after intestinal immunization (230). However, the a4p7 level was apparendy not sufficient to make the cells gut-seeking, whereas antibody production was evoked in both adenoids and nasal mucosa (259). Likewise, when the slgD+IgM\" putative primed tonsillar effector B-ceU subset (identified by its Cp-aud S|i-gene deletion; see above) is observed in the circulation, its adhesion molecule profile shows rather little a4|37 but a relatively high and uniform level of Lselectin expressiou (P. Brandtzaeg A non-iutestiual homing receptor profile might also explain effector B-cell migration from NALT to the urogeuital tract (Fig, 20) . As reviewed elsewhere (43), this putative link is reflected by particularly high levels of specific IgA and IgG antibodies in cervicovaginal secretions of mice and monkeys after intranasal immunization with a variety of antigens. Also BALT could be involved as inductive sites in these experiments, especially in anesthetized mice (260), Other studies have shown that stimulation of GALT, particularly via the rectal route, cau induce antibodies in the female genital tract of rodeuts (43) and humans (261, 262), although the human vaccination results have been variable (247, 263). This problem might be caused by uncontrolled accessibility to the inductive tissue of the human large bowel (Fig, 20) , which is constituted by numerous scattered lymphoid folhcles (31) and perhaps the appendix (see above), Interestingly, an immunological link has been suggested to exist between the upper respiratory tract and rectal mucosa (247), but no difference iu the expression of a4p7 or L-selectin was observed for circulatiug antibody-producing cells resulting frotn rectal compared with oral immunization (230, 247).",

Tbe first of its five extracellular Ig-like domains (DI) initiates tbe non-covalent ligand interaction at the basolateral epithelial-cell membrane, and a loop similar to the first complementarity determining region (CDRl) of IgVic domains has been shown to be essential for pIgA binding (266) , This region of DI shows a remarkably higb degree of sequence conservation, but the ability of pIgR to interact with pentameric IgM is nevertheless differently preserved among various species (266) . Thus, buman pIgR binds both pIgA and pentameric IgM, while the rabbit counterpart has virtually no binding capacity for the latter ligand. We interchanged DI between buman and rabbit pIgR, and found that human D1 was essential for pentameric IgM binding, and sufficient to confer sucb biuding to a chimeric pIgR witb rabbit D2-D5 (171).

Moreover, as discussed above, mucosal IgA plasma cells release variable amounts of monomeric IgA in addition to pIgA, whereas IgMproducing cells normally are virtually restricted to pentamer secretion (281) . Altogether, our calculations suggest tbat tbe exterual transport of pIgA is favoured at least 6-to 1 2-fold over tbat of pentameric IgM on a molar basis (Fig, 8) , Significant biological variables of secretory immunity other tban the local immunocyte distribution tberefore appear to exist. Such variables could be differences in tbe ligand affinity for pIgR. in tbe efficiency of receptor-mediated epithelial transcytosis of the Anli-SC (red seperation) Anti-SC + anti-lqA (qreen Anti-I (red) + anti-A (green) Anti-I (red) + antJ-A (green) Possible ligand-enhanced transport The regulation of human pIgR appears to differ from that ofthe rabbit and rat receptors, for which transcytosis is stimulated by bound ligand. Thus, rabbit pIgR complexed with buman pIgA was transcytosed somewhat faster than unoccupied or anti-SC (Fab)-reacted receptor (283, 284) , Sucb ligand-mediated enhancement ofthe pIgR transport rate was also noted to operate for tbe rat receptor in vivo (285) . Contrary to these observations, we found that the human pIgR transcytosis rate was not influenced by binding of eitber pIgA or pentatneric IgM at concentrations reported to stimulate rabbit pIgR transcytosis (282). Thus, our results suggested tbat different levels of receptor saturation do not influence the rate of epithelial antibody transport mediated by the human pIgR (Fig. 26) , Altogether, species differences seem to exist with regard to regulation of pIgR transcytosis. It sbould be noted, however, tbat aithougb huinan pIgA was found to stimulate this process when mediated by the rabbit pIgR, the reported effect was rather small and most pronounced witb a mutant receptor tbat showed reduced efficiency of apical sorting (283, 284) , Tberefore, the biological significance of such ligand stimulation is questionable. Importantly substantial amounts of buman pIgR are continuously transcytosed across secretory epitbeliai cells in vivo even without any bound ligand (286), This observation has been further substantiated by comparing tbe level of SC in parotid saliva from IgA-deficient and hypogammaglobulinaemic subjects with normal coutrcils; the amount of free SC (plus IgM-bound SC) in the former two categories of secretion was found to be of tbe same magnitude as that of free and bound (mainly SIgA-associated) SC in normal controls (278) .

However, this suggestion is poorly documented, and it is difficult to assess the possible outcome in terms of an inflammatory reaction, for instance caused by TNF-a release as discussed above. Interestingly, potentially tissue-damaging eosinophils possess not only FcaRI but apparently also a receptor for free and bound SC (334), This probably explains that SIgA exhibits particularly strong eosinophil-degranulating properties (327, 335) and in this respect appears to be more potent than cross-linked IgE antibodies, which instead may be more involved in the recruitment and priming of these cells (336). Also, SIgA has been shown to induce degrannlation of IL-3primed basophils (33 7). Thus, by interacting with eosinophils and basophils (perhaps also mast cells?), SIgA provides a proinflammatory potential of the secretory immune system when immune exclusion fails, such as in parasitic mucosal infestations. However, it is at present difficult to know how the balance between SIgA and free SC may influence eosinophil activation, because free SC in solution (but presumably not on a surface) may be blocking in this respect (334, 335).",

A similar detrimental side effect of IgG antibody has been observed in vivo (340). This is probably explained by local formation of complement-fixing IgG-containing immune complexes (27) and activation of mast cells (339) . The proinflammatory potential of maternal IgG present in the intestinal mucosa ofthe newborns, or of locally produced IgG antibodies, may be less important in infants who are breast-fed because milk SIgA antibodies, which have little or no complement-activating capacity (292). will exert a non-inflammatory blocking effect (311).",

Also, the homing mechanisms of mucosal B cells appear to be remarkably regionalized, but they remain to be defined in the upper aerodigestive tract, 4) Retention and acctitnulation of B cells extravasated at secretory effector sites are influenced by antigen-driven local proliferation and differentiation. However, the relative roles of stromal T cells and IELs, MHC class Il-positive APCs and epithelial cells in providing the necessary stimulatory signals for proliferation and terminal differentiation of the local B cells are unknown, 5) The mucosal barrier normally allows some penetration of intact soluble antigens so there is probably always a need for immune elimination in the lamina propria. If immune exclusion is impaired (e.g. in IgA deficiency), or if there is too large an antigen load on the epithelial barrier (e.g, in chronic infection) , activated nonspecific amplification mechanisms involved in immune elimination may cause hypersensitivity which is observed clinically as mucosal disease. This immunopathological development may he mediated by proinflammatory IgG and IgE antibodies as well as by hyperactivated APCs and T cells. Although these immunopathogenic mechanisms are rather well understood in several types of intestinal disorders such as atopic food allergy and coeliac disease, the cause of their initiation, possibly involving abrogation of oral tolerance, generally remains unexplained. 6) Clinical observations in immunodeficient patients have shown that SIgA, SIgM and IgG are not the only important components of the intestinal mucosal defence system. It is becoming increasingly evident that innate immunity is crucial and much more complex than previously believed; the cooperation between innate and adaptive mucosal immunity needs exploration to better understand how homeostasis of mucous membranes normally is maintained. 6 ",

The fact that jejunal IgA immunocytes are mainly of the IgAl subclass (-77%), in contrast to the IgA2 dominance (-64%) in the colon(73), may hence refiect the disparate distribution of food antigens vs Gram-negative bacteria in the normal gut. We have observed that bacterial overgrowth in bypassed jejunal segments alters the composition of the local immunocyte population with an increase of IgA2 and a decrease of IgM (81), suggesting LPS-induced direct isotype switching from C|J.

The reason for the relatively high proportion of this isotype (~18%) in the proximal small intestine remains unknown; it may be related to the absence of LPS (see above), and is in striking contrast to the situation in the upper aerodigestive tract (25, 82).

In IgA deficiency, the disparity between the two regions is even more striking for IgD than for IgM immunocytes (Fig. 4). According to our immunohistochemical studies, IgE-producing cells are virtually absent from human mucosae, although occasional exceptions are seen in atopic allergy (85). Disparate distribution of IgG subclass-producing cells Our studies of mucosaj IgG immunocytes have shown a distribution of IgGI (56-69%) that generally makes it the predominant locally produced IgG subclass (86-88). In tbe distal gut, IgG2 cells are more frequent (20-35%) than IgG3 cells (4-6%), whereas the reverse is often true in the upper airway mucosa. This IgG subclass disparity supports the idea that the B-cell isotype switching pathways differ in various mucosal regions (30). Interestingly, the genes for CY2 and Ca2 are located on the same duphcated DNA segment (89), and many carbohydrate and hacterial antigens preferentially induce an IgG2 response in addition to IgA2, whereas proteins (T-celldependent antigens) primarily generate an IgGI (and IgG3) response together with IgAl (90), such as seen in the proximal small intestine (73, 87).",

Tbe J cbain gene appears to be evolutionarily conserved to a remarkable degree (91), suggesting that it has been acquired from tbe imaate immune system. Us functional role in the adaptive immune system was an enigma until our laboratory obtained evidence that the presence of J chain in pIgA and pentameric IgM is crucial for the efficient non-covaient binding of these polymers to free SG or pIgR (15, 92-94). This notion has been supported by observations made in J chain knockout mice (9S) and in transgenic cells expressing genes for Ig, J chain and pIgR/SC (18, 96). The actual pig binding site for free SG (94) or pIgR (16, 17) can indeed be blocked by antibody to J chain. Moreover, experimental studies have suggested that although this peptide is not required for IgA and IgM polymerization, the available amount of J chain determines the production ratio between monomeric IgA and pIgA as well as between pentameric IgM and J chain-deficient hexameric IgM (94, 97-99).",

This disparity could be explained by the fact that J chain is mainly incorporated into pentameric IgM late in the intracellular assembly process, at a stage wben the polymers are not yet completely stabilized by covalent bonds (101, 102). Moreover, studies of murine plasmacytomas showed that J chain production was excessive in IgM cells compared with that iu IgA cells (103). Likewise, a Sfold molar excess of cytoplasmic over secreted J chain was found in IgM-producing rabbit spleen cells after mitogen stim-, 88% of IgAl and 100% of IgA2 immunocytes in normal intestinal mucosa are engaged in pIgA production as revealed by their J chain expression (lOS), but this fact does not exclude a variable concurrent output of monomers (20, 94). The latter possibility was indicated hy the fmding that the venous effluent of perfused segmeuts of human gut contained 20-30% monomeric IgA (106). However, physicochemical analyses of the IgA spontaneously secreted by cultured mononuclear cells obtained from buman gut mucosa have provided discrepant information: MacDermott et al. (107) reported 3 1% monomers whereas Kutteh et al. (108) concluded that about equal proportions of monomeric IgA and pIgA were produced.Contamination with epithelial cells, which release preformed SIgA, is an inherent problem in such experiments (108). It is also possible tbat free SC, released into tbe culture fluid from epithelial cells, may complex with pIgA and thereby partially mask its in vitro production. There is, on the other hand, evidence suggesting that the proportion of pIgA secreted from lymphoid cells may increase after prolonged culturing (109).",

Thus, homing within the mucosal B-cell system is more related to J chain expression than to IgA commitment.

Local retention of sucb putative mature clones with downregulated J chain expression shows a progressive increase of GALT, mesenteric lymph nodes, peripheral lymph nodes and palatine tonsUs from adults (30). These differences might to some extent depend on the magnitude of persistent stimulation, which is probably mucb bigher in tbe tonsils with their antigen-retaining crypts than in GALT, j chain regulation Little is known about cytokine profiles or other microenvironmental conditions that induce and maintain so strikingly the expression of J chain in B cells giving rise to immunocytes at secretory effector sites. As discussed above, such expression is also seen, although to a lesser degree, in immunocytes associated with organized MALT structures (Figs 11 & 12), the highest levels being expressed by extrafoUicular IgA-and IgD-producing ceUs in normal tonsils from children and hy IgA-producing cells retained around GALT follicles (30, 100, 123).

Primary intestinal follicles occur early in fetal life, but secondary follicles with germinal centres (Fij|. IB) depend on antigenic stimulation and do not appear until shortly after birth (143). The primary follicles contain recirculating CD19\"\u0108 D20+ lymphocytes witb a naive phenotype (sIgD+IgM+), both sig isotypes contributing to the same antigen specificity of tbe B-cell receptor (BCR). The naive lymphocytes pass into tbe spaces of the network formed by tbe antigen-capturing follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), tbe origin of whicb remains obscure (144). One important signal for FDC clustering and tbe follicle development is known to be tbe soluble bomotrimer lymphotoxin (LT)-a, previously termed tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-P (145, 146). Experimental evidence suggests that the B-ceUderived type of tbis cytokine is particularly important (147). Among the known actions of LT-a is augmentation of B-ceU proliferation and adhesion molecule expression. Knockout mice deficient in LT-a (LT-a\"' ' \"\") virtually lack lymph nodes and have no detectable Peyer's patches. A membrane-associated form of LT moreover exists as a beterotrimeric complex containing LT-a together with a transmembrane protein designated LT-J3. Knockout mice deficient in LT-P bave no detectable FDCs, and they lack Peyer's patches, peripheral lymph nodes and organized splenic germinal centres (146). The germinal centre reaction In humans, this process bas been extensively studied in the tonsils (63, 148-150), but functional information is mainly derived from lymph nodes and spleen of immunized experimental animals (151). Germinal centres are of vital importance for T-cell-dependent generation of memory B cells, affmity maturation of the BCR, and Ig isotype switching (84). It is believed tbat naive B cells are initially stimulated in tbe extrafolhcular area (on the left in Fig. 13) tbrough cognate help by activated CD4\"^ T cells to wbich interdigitating APCs bave presented processed foreign antigen (152). The B cells then produce unmutated IgM (and some IgG) antibody of low affinity tbat can bind circulating antigen; the resulting soluble immune complexes subsequently become deposited on FDCs (Fig. 13) \"where antigen is retained for prolonged periods to maintain B-ceU memory (120, 148-153). Such a role of IgM in the induction of secondary immune responses with antibody affmity maturation, bas been strongly supported by observations in knockout mice lacking the natural (\"non-specific\") background IgM antibodies (154).The actual germinal centre \"founder ceU\" has been tentatively identified in buman palatine tonsils as an sIgD+IgM+ CD38\"^ proliferative lympbocyte subset (148); murine experiments suggest that its attraction to tbe primary foUicles partially is determined by a chemokine tbat interacts with the Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLRl) on tbese cells(145, 155, 156).Tbis chemokine bas recently been identified and termed B-lympbocyte chemoattractant (BLC) in mice (15 7) and B-cell attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1) in bumans. It belongs to the CXC family and its receptor bas been caUed CXCR5 (158). The source of BLC could be the FDCs and, interestingly, its follicular expression was much more consistent in Peyer's patches than in peripheral lymph nodes (157). Therefore, alternative B-cellspccific chemokines might operate in lympb nodes and perbaps also in tonsils. Indeed, anotber CXC chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor la (SDF-la), was recently sbown by an in vitro assay to attract naive and memory tonsiUar B ceUs which bear tbe specific receptor (CXCR4) for tbis chemokine (159).",

Tbe complement receptors CR2/CR1 (CD21/CD35) are considered among tbe cell surface molecules tbat play a crucial role in the germinal centre reaction. CD2 1 is expressed abundantly on both FDCs and B cells, thereby having a critical function either by localizing antigen to the FDC network and/or by lowering the threshold <Df B-cell activation via recruitment of CD 19 into the BCR (145), Activation of complement occurs on FDCs when they retain immune complexes (on the right inFig. 13) but generally witb no apparent harm to tbe germinal centres. Inbibition of C9 polymerization by associated S-protein (vitronectin), protectin (CD59), and decay accelerating factor (DAF or CD55) most likely dampens the lytic activity (161, 162). Nevertheless, release of inflammatory mediators may cause local oedema that facilitates dispersion of FDCderived \"immune complex-coated bodies\", or iccosomes, thereby enhancing the BCR-mediated uptake of their contained antigens by B cells (161).

Also, centrocytes with specificities for exogenous antigens die by apoptosis unless selected by higb affinity binding to FDCs via their sIgM (Fig. 13). The centrocytes may actually pick up antigen from iccosomes, process it and present foreign peptide to CD4\"^ Th cells that are always found scattered within the follicles (148, 151, 153). In addition to B-cell adbesion to FDCs and antigen crosslinking of BCR, cognate costimulatory interaction takes place between the activated intrafoUicular T cells, which express the CD40 hgand (CD40L, gp 39 or CD154), and memory B cells, which express CD40 (Fig, 13); this appears to be an important event in rescuing centrocytes from CD95 (APO-1/Fas)induced apoptosis and a key signal for their maintained sur\\'ival (150, 151, 153, 164, 165), The interaction may be enhanced by sustained activation of the Th cells via specialized CD4+CD1 lc\"^ germinal centre DCs which also can pick up foreign antigens by binding immune complexes (166). Following immune activation, it is furthermore crucial that the positively selected centrocytes express Bcl-2, a protein implicated in the prevention of apoptosis (Fig. 13). No germinal centres are formed when CD40-CD40L ligation is experimentally blocked, documenting tbe importance of cognate interaction between B and T cells (153), Moreover, this ligation promotes switching of the CH genes from C(i (IgM) to downstream isotypes, while apparently representing a nega-tive signal for terminal B-cell differentiation within the follicles (148, 151, 167), Resistance to the effec: of CD40L, or other elusive signals, probably contribute to the important decision as :o whether primed B cells should continue to leave tbe memory pathway and differentiate along the effector pathway (120, 168) -either locally to become extrafollicular plasma cells, or after migration to distant secretory effector sites (Fig. 11). Regionalized isotype deveioptnent and emigration of pritned B cells Emigration of activated B cells from germinal centres is most likely directed by cbemokines such as EBV-induced molecule 1 (EBI-1) ligand chemokine (FLC), In mice, this CCR7 ligand was sliown to be constitutively expressed in extrafollicular areas of Peyer's patches and lymph nodes (169). In fact, most MALT-induced B cells (sIgD-IgM+CD38^) appear to migrate rapidly out of the germinal centres into extrafollicular compartments sucb as the tonsiUar crypt epithelium (170) or Peyer's patch M-cell areas where they may continue to present antigen (3 0). Also most of the precursors for plasma cells (CD20-CD38^') rapidly exit to terminate at local (extrafoUicular) or distant effector sites (Fig. 11), after whicb tbeir half-life varies from a few days to several months (120). Those ending up in gut mucosa may be particularly sbort-lived, whicb may explain wby mucosal immune responses often are deemed to bave a relatively limited memory (171). effector-cell differentiation in this mucosal region takes place mainly from sIgD-IgM^CD38* centrocytes by sequential downstream CH gene switching (30, 124, 141). Conversely, tlie enhanced IgA2 development in the Peyer's patches and the distal gut altogether, including the mesenteric lympb nodes (73, 86, 117), might reflect direct switching from C^L to Ca2 expression witb looping out of intervening C\u011d ene segments (143). There is much evidence to suggest that B cells from murine Peyer's patches can undergo a direct switch from C|i to Ca (172), and in human B cells this patbway may preferentially lead to IgA2 production (173). Molecular evidence for autocrine transforming growth factor (TGF)-Pinduced direct S|i->Sa as well as equential S|I->SY, SY->Sa DNA recombination, was recently obtained in naive human B cells after engagement of CD40 (174). The germinal centre reaction of human GALT structures (Peyer's patches and appendix) generates relatively more intrafoUicular IgA immunocytes with J chain than seen in tbe tonsiUar follicles; and in the adjacent intestinal lamina propria and dome zones, immunocytes producing IgA equal, or dominate over, those producing IgG (27, 117). This is in contrast to the more than 2-fold extrafollicular dominance of IgG immunocytes in the tonsils (124). Thus, the drive for switching to IgA and expression of J chain is clearly much more pronounced in GALT than in tonsils and peripheral lymph nodes. Many explanations for tbis remarkable intestinal B-ceU regulation have been offered as discussed elsewhere (172). Perhaps the continuous superimposition of new environmental and microbial stimuli in tbe gut enhances the development of early effector B-cell clones witb increased potential for IgA and Jchain expression (see ahove). Alternatively, the GALT microenvironment may be at least partially distinct from that of other immune-inductive sites because of special accessory ceUs or a particular cytokine profile. Altogether, it is possible that molecular events in the GALT germinal centres promote the generalion of a particular (and as yet incompletely characterized) B-cell phenotype. In this context it is interesting that a unique sIgM-negative subset (sIgD+IgM\"CD38+) of centroblasts has been identified in the dark zone of palatine tonsiUar germinal centres; they show Cn-gene deletion of the C^ and switch region (S|i). therefore apparendy giving rise to immunocytes only of the IgD class (175). We bave recently obtained molecular evidence for tbe frequent presence of B cells witb the same Cn-gene deletion, also in the adenoids and secretory effector tissues of the upper aerodigestive tract, but virtuaUy never in GALT and intestinal mucosa (176), Our observations strongly support tbe notion that preferential B-cell homing takes place from nasopharyngeal MALT structures to the upper aerodigestive tract (30. 53, 141, 142); such regionalized migration of sIgD^IgM\"CD38\u0109 entroblasts probably explains tbe relatively high frequency of the IgD isotype among mucosal plasma cells in this region normally, and particularly in selective IgA deficiency (Fig. 4). It is possible that the upper airway microbiota contributes to tbis regional B-ceU regulation. Thus, most strains of Haemophilus influenzflc and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, which are frequent colonizers of this region, produce an IgD-binding factor (protein D) that can crosshuk sIgD (177, 178). In tbis way the sIgD+sIgM CD38^ tonsiUar B-ceU subset could be stimulated to proliferate and differentiate in a polyclonal manner On the other hand, LPS that is abundandy present in the distal gut, may inhibit selective expression of IgD (1 79). Identified IgA-promoting stimuli DCs from murine Peyer's patcbes and spleen were initially suggested to enhance IgA production in a microcukure system based on cognate interactions between B and T cells (180). A similar role for DCs was recently ohserved in a human in vitro test system not including T cells but employing CD40-activated naive B cells (181). As reviewed elsewbere (182), TGF-p bas previously been reported to be a crucial IgA \"switch factor\". while IL-2, IL-5. and IL-10 are important cytokines for clonal expansion of activated B cells and their preferential IgA expression (on the left in Fig. 16). Terminal differentiation to IgA-producing plasma cells may additionally involve IL-6. IL-10 and possibly interferon (IFN)-Y (on the right in Fig. 16), aU cytokines known to be produced by antigen-activated CD4\"* T cells cloned from htiman intestinal mucosa (183). IL-6 preferentially enhances IgA production (IgA2>IgAl) by human appendix B cells (184), and in mice this cytokine appears to be essential for terminal B-cell maturation (182). In humaus, a central role for IL-10 is supported by the fact that this cytokine can release the differentiation block of IgA-committed B cells from IgA-deficient patients (185). Human naive B cells activated tbrough CD40 can be pushed towards IgA secreti{jn by TGF-|i and IL-10 (186). but recent studies suggest that TGF-p is the more active IgA-inducing cytokine (174). Interestingly. DCs enhance synergistically the effect of botb TGF-p and IL-10 on IgA expression, and may indeed, via unknown signals, be essential for IgA2 production in vitro (181). Schematic representation of regulatory aspects of secretory immunity that take place in inductive compartment (on the left) and at mucosal effector site (on the right). Various cytokine.'; are apparently mvolved in isotype switching and terminal differentiation of mucosal B cells to promote the striking generation of plasma cells that produce dimeric IgA with I chain (IgA-l-J) at secretory effector sites. Some of these cytokines may be derived from antigenpresenting cells (APC), T helper cells (Th) or the epithelium, as indicated. In the gut, both TGF-p and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may act as IgA switch factors. Certain Th-and APC-derived cytokines also upregulate epithelial expression of lransmembrane secretory component (or pIgR), thereby providing a regulatory link betvi'een the immunologica! activity at the effector site and the magnitude of local external transport of secretory IgA (SIgA). Gut hormones and other putative region-specific B-cell stimuli Fiuman fetal B cells activated in vitro tbrough CD40 were selectively induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) to IgAl andIgA2 production (187). Similarly treated sIgM-CD19+ pre-B cells from human fetal bone marrow were induced to produce IgM and botb IgA subclasses (187). These results suggested that VIP can act as a true switch factor (Fig. 16), whicb is interesting in view of its relatively high concentrations in gut mucosa. VIP was furthermore reported to promote the number of IgA precursors, together with increased IgA and decreased IgG syntbesis, in cultures of intestinal mononuclear cells (188).Finally, substance P bas been sbown to enhance IgA and IgM production by murine B-cell lines, the latter isotype particularly in the presence of LPS (189).In mice, intestinal \"contrasuppressor cells\" have been implicated as an additional mechanism selectively releasing IgA responses from T-cell-mediated suppression (oral tolerance).Tbis IgA-enhancing effect (probably cytokine-mediated) was ascribed to TCRy/5+ intraepitbelial lymphocytes (IELs). Support for this notion was obtained in TCR.5\"''\" knockout mice which showed a significantly reduced number of intestinal IgA-producing cells and a poor IgA antibody response after oral immunization, wbile IgM and IgG were intact (190). If y/S T cells exert a similar effect in humans, this might contribute to tbe relatively large IgA production in tbe gut where TCRy/S* IELs are considerably more frequent tban in tbe upper respiratory tract",

In GALT, high endothelial venules (HEV) in the paralbllicular zone express mticosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM)-1, in which the membrane-near mucin-like domain (bottle brush symbol) contains L-selectin-binding O-linked carbohydrates (CHO); this interaction contributes to immigration of naive lymphocytes into the inductive GALT structures.

As discussed above (Fig. 5), approximately equal numbers of small T and B cells were present in tbe mononuclear cell suspensions, and in situ studies sbowed that the naive B cells of the follicular mantle zones mostly expressed abundant L-selectin but variable levels of a4|i7 and usually no pi (CD29). Most lymphocytes expressing L-selectin around or within tbe parafoUicular HEVs showed the naive T-cell phenotype (CD3+CD45RA+) but some were B cells (Fig. 6), again mainly of the naive phenotype (slgD^). The lymphocytes expressing L-selectin were usually only weakly positive or negative for a4p7 (203). Altogether, our in .situ data accorded well with the flow-cytometric characteristics of dispersed human GALT cells (Toble 1) and were compatible witb the adhesion molecule profile expected f(3r lymphocytes at their site of entrance and accumulation in GALT (on the left in Fig. 15). Role of chemokines The initial adhesion molecule-mediated attachment (tethering) of the free-flowing leukocytes to the endothelium is relatively loose until they are stopped by a signalling event linked to GTPbinding proteins, probably in the main provided by cbemokines that interact with corresponding surface membrane receptors (204). This triggers rapid activation of leukointegrins, leading to flrm adherance (arrest) and subsequent leukocyte emigration (205). An exception to this paradigzn is tbe binding of primed cells (a4p7'\") to MAdCAM-1; as mentioned above, this event can take place independently of L-selectin (200), thus suggesting that memory/effector cells extravasate in the gut without initial tethering mediated by L-selectin (Fig. ]7B), Several chemokines that may activate rapid adhesion of lymphocytes to HEVs have recently been identified. Very compelling evidence is available for a secondary lymphoid-organ chemokine (SLC), which is a CC chemokine also known as 6-C-kine, TCA4 or Exodus-2 (herein referred to as 6CK/SLC). Transcripts for 6CK/SLC are strongly expressed in HEVs and non-lymphoid cells in the T-cell areas of murine peripheral lymph nodes as well as Peyer's patches (157). The migration of cells, MIP-3a acts mainly on the memory phenotype (CD45RA-R0+) whereas SDF-1 exerts its strongest effect on the naive phenotype (CD45RA+R0 ) (208), Although expression of these chemokines by HEV endothelium has not been described, endothehal transcytosis could still enable their presentation on the HEV surface if they are produced by surrounding tissue elements (209). Microenvironmentol migration Very little knowledge exists about how immune cells, after emigration, are directed to, and retained within, the various microcompartments of organized lymphoid tissue. It is assumed that chemokines (145, 156) as well as fibronectin and other extracellular matrix components play an essential role. As mentioned above, the chemokine BLC/BCA-1 that interacts with BLRl /CXC5 on B cells appears to contribute to their migration into lymphoid foUicles. Gene targeting that abolishes this receptor generates mice whose B cells, after transfer to wildtype httermates, fail to enter the foUicles of spleen and Peyer's patches despite normal immigration into the T-cell areas (155). Therefore, BLC-BLRl interactions do not seem to be crucial for the emigration of B cells through HEVs.Other chemokines with a microcompartmental expression pattern have also been identified. Thus, it appears that 6CK/SLC (see above). which is preferentially expressed in the parafollicuiar areas of murine peripheral lymph nodes and GALT. attracts T cells more strongly than B cells (2 1 0-21 2). Moreover, interactions between leukointegrins (a4piand a4p7) and fibronectin (213) orMAdGAM-1 (160) may be particularly involved in GALT (30), Consistent with this notion, reticular fibres with fibronectin, collagen and laminin are oriented parallel to the presumed migration pathway from HEVs to the domes of 'murine Peyer's patches (214). In addition, critical architectural features such as channels or \"corridors\", as well as proteolytic activities, probably play an essential role in guiding microcompartmental cell migration(215. 216).",

A recent flow-cytometric study of circulating human lymphocytes supported such a fundamental subdivision according to vascular adhesion properties (221). The heterogeneity of GALT-derived B cells might explain systemic dissemination of IgG as well as IgA responses after oral immunization. As discussed elsewhere, convincing evidence exists that the systemic and mucosal immune systems are not totally segregated (27. 28); it is quite possible to prime and boost local immune responses by parenteral immunization, and vice-versa.

All characterized mammalian species, and also chickens(289), possess IgA in addition to IgM. The evolution of IgA as the major secretory antibody class bas introduced interesting changes conducive to mucosal homeostasis. Aitbough our in vitro data showed tbat human pIgR-mediated transport of pentameric IgM is just as efficient as that of pIgA, we concluded that external translocation ofthe latter polymer is markedly favoured in vivo because of its better diffusion tbrough the extracellular matrix and basement membranes (282), Therefore, tbe reduced size of pIgA may reflect a compromise between its advantageous external translocation and tbe number of antigen binding sites carried to the secretions. The pIgA molecule as such is well adapted to the proteolytic environment in external secretions (32, 290). In addition, its stabilization witb covalently bound SC endows SIgA with increased resistance against digestive enzymes (277, 291) and bacterial proteases (32).

Conversely, the stimulatory effect of IL-4 is selectively decreased by butyrate (295), Transcriptionai regtjlotion of the human pIgR/SC gene Our recent molecular experiments with HT-29 cells have demonstrated that IFN-Y, IL-4 and TNF-a enhance pIgR/SC expression by transcriptionai activation {266, 297), and these cytokines can thus provide an immunoregulatory link between the level of local immune responses and the antibody transport function of pIgR (on tbe right in Fig. 16). We and others have cloned and characterized the plgR/SC gene including ics promoter region, and putative binding sites for various transcription factors, including glucocorticoid and androgen receptors, have been identified (298-302), A composite DNA element constituting an E-box consensus motif (Fig. 27), which binds proteins of tbe basic-hehx-loop-belix/leucine-zipper (bHLH/LZ) family, was shown to be most important for constitutive pIgR/SC transcription in a reporter gene assay (300), A recent study of the murine pIgR promoter has imphcated upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-I and possibly USF-2 as the bHLH/LZ members necessary for constitutive pIgR/SC expression (303). Sequence analysis of the human gene has identified a number of putative DNA elements that contribute to its cytokineenhanced expression (301), Tln-ee IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), two upstream of transcription start (centred around position -133 and -100) and one in exon 1 (centred around position +13), are potential sites for gene induction mediated by IFN-y and TNF-a (Fig, 28), Piskurich et al. (301) investigated the role of these ISREs in IFN-y-induced pIgR transcription, hi a reporter gene construct spanning from position -563, deletion ofthe ISRE in exon 1 reduced IFN-y-stimulated transcription. When the upstream region was deleted to position -280, deletion of the same ISRE had no effect. Further deletion to position -95, thereby removing the two upstream ISREs. completely abolished gene induction by IFN-y, clearly implicating a role of these regulatory elements. Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays (GEMSA) demonstrated protein binding to all three ISREs. hut only binding to the ISRE in exon 1 was induced by IFN-y By supershift with corresponding antibody. this inducible factor was demonstrated to be IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-l. Furthermore, an IRF-1 promoter-based reporter gene was induced by IFN-y in HT-29 cells, suggesting that IRF-the pIgR promoter, and that this induciion depended on the ISRE in exon 1 (C. S. Kaetzel. personal communication). This ISRE has also been imphcated in TNF-a-induced upreguiation of pIgR (Fig. 28): in a reporter gene construct extending from -280, its deletion abohshed the effect of TNF-a but not that of IFN-y (302), However, induction mediated by TNE-a through this ISRE was modest compared to that ohtained with IFN-y, and we have strong evidence to suggest that the effect of TNF-a is additionaiiy supported by regulatory elements found in intron 1 of the human pIgR7SC gene (H, Schjerven, R Brandtzaeg, F,-E, Johansen, unpubhshed data). The IFN-y-inducible binding of nuclear factor(s) to the ISRE in exon 1 was recently confirmed by us, and we demonstrated that the same factor(s) was also induced by TNF-a, albeit more weakly than by IFN-y (297), We have furthermore identified a DNA element in intron 1 that is crucial for the IL-4-mediated activation of rhe hutnan pIgR/SC gene (305), Immunohistochemical observations in coeliac disease, chronic gastritis and Sjogren's syndrome harmonize with an immune response-associated enhancement of secretory immunity (Fig, 16); signs of upregulated pIgR/SC expression and increased receptor-mediated uptake of pIgA are seen in the secretory epithelium of all these immunologicaiiy active lesions (306), Nevertheless, the epithehal transport capacity may be insufficient in certain patients with an exceptionally expanded intestinal IgA immunocyte expansion, resulting in excessive amounts of pIgA in serum (307). Non-inflamtnatory humoral defence of mucosae Role of secretory antibodies and free SC in immune exclusion The main purpose ofthe secretory antihody system is. in cooperation with innate mucosal defence mechanisms, to perform immune exclusion (Figs 2 & 29). Most importantly SIgA inhibits colonization and invasion by pathogens (32). Both pIgA and pentameric IgM antibodies internalized by the pIgR may even inactivate viruses (e,g. rotavirus) inside epithelial cells and carry the pathogens and their products back to the lumen (44-^7), The agglutinating and virus-neutrahzing antibody effect of pIgA is in fact superior compared with monomeric antibodies (27, 32, 290). and SIgA antibodies can block tnicrobial invasion quite efficiently (308), Thus, individuals negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who live together with HIV-certain hacteria to mucus, interfere with growth factors (e.g, iron) and enzymes necessary for pathogenic bacteria and parasites (27, 32), and exert positive influences on the inductive phase of mucosal immunity by promoting relevant antigen uptake in GALT (28). The latter possibihty adds to the importance of breast-feeding in providing a supply of SIgA antibodies to the infant's gut (311), Moreover, induction of SIgA responses has been shown to interfere significantly with mucosal uptake of macromolecules in experimental animals (27), and pIgR/SC biockout mice show evidence of increased mucosai ieakiness and uptake of Escherichia coli antigens (29). Collectively, therefore, the functions of locally produced pIgA would be to inhibit mucosal colonization of microorganisms as well as penetration of soluble antigens (Fig. 29), Notably, because of its stability (see above), SIgA can retain its antibody activity for remarkably prolonged periods in a hostile environment such as the oral cavity (291), This immune exclusion function is most likely reinforced hy the relatively high levels of cross-reacting SIgA antibodies present in external secretions (312). These polyreactive \"natural\" antibodies apparently are designed for urgent protection before an adaptive imniune response is elicited; they are therefore reminiscent of innate immunity (313). although their site and mechanism of indnction remain unclear (see above). In addition, interaction of SIgA with the intestinal superantigen protein Ev (Fv fragment binding protein) may build an \"immune fortress\" by forming large complexes of intact or degraded antibodies with different specificities, tbereby probably reinforcing immune exclusion in the gut (314). Interestingly, free SC can inhibit epithelial adhesion of F. coli (315) and bind the potent toxiti of C]o,stridimri difficile (316). Moreover, a pneumococcal surface protein (SpsA) has recently been shown to interact directly with hoth free and bound SC (317). Altogether, these biological properties of SC suggest that it phylo genetically has originated from the innate defence system like many other proteins involved in specific immunity Role of IgA-mediated immune elimination Magnitude of mucosal uptaiie of soluble antigens Intact antigenic material from the gut lumen has been shown to cross the mucosal harrier and enter the blood stream even in normal adults, although the actual amount of uptake remains Normal lamina propria Lumen Fig. 29. Schematic depiction of normal mucosai homeostasis in the gut. Contributing biological variables are represented as a criiical balance between available imi-nunoglobulin classes (for simplicity, only IgG and IgA are indicated), Secretory IgA is generated from dimeric IgA with associated I chain produced by lamina propria immunocytes and transported by the transmembrane secretory component (SC or pIgR) to the lnmeii, together with variable amounts of tmoccnpied cleaved receptor called free SC (f-SC), Secretory IgA antibodies act in a fir,st-line defence by performing antigen exclusion in mucus on the epithelial surface (to the right). Antigens circumventing this barrier meet corresponding serum-derived IgG antibodies in the lamina propria. The resulting immune complexes activate complement, and inflammatory mediators are formed within the mucosa, thus causing a temporarily increased external transfer of IgG antibodies by leakage between epithelial cells to the lumen (broken arrow), A persistent and adverse inflammatory development is normally inhibited by blocking antibody activities (competition for antigen depicted) exerted in the lamina propria by serum-derived monomeric IgA as well as by locally produced monomeric and eiipecially dimeric IgA, Both lypes of IgA molecules may, independent of their antibody specificities, also inhibit mediator release (TNF-a depicted) from activated phagocycic cells such as macrophages (M(|)), Moreover, antigens may be returned in a non-inflammatory way to the lumen by the pIgR-mcdiaied transport mechanism after being bound to J chain-containing dimeric IgA antibody as indicated. uncertain. Work performed in experimental animals with '^^Ilabelled albumin has been difficult to interpret due to marker instability (318), Both degradation of the protein molecule and release of the label can result in considerable overestimation of penetrability as determined by scintillation counting compared with data based on immunologicaj quantification. However, several human studies have reported absorption of intact dietary antigens in healthy adults, Paganelli & Levinsky (319) found up to 3 ng/ml of p-lactoglobulin in peripheral blood after an intake of 1,2 1 of bovine milk, Kilshaw & Cant (320) often detected bovine p-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin in botb human serum and breast milk, the levels ranging from 110 pg/ml to 6,4 ng/ml in the latter fluid, Husby et al. (321) detected up to 10 ng/ml of ovalbumin, wbich corresponds to about 10\"^ of tbe amount consumed. Most ofthe atitigen appeared in tbe circulation after 2-5 h and was partly present in immune complexes (see below). Routes of intestinol ontigen uptake Several routes may be visualized for the penetration of intact antigen through the normal intestinal epithelium: paracellular diffusion bypassing the tight junctions or via epithelial discontinnities sttch as the cell extrusion zones ofthe villus tips; translocation through enterocytes hy endocytosis and subsequent exocytosis; or transport by M cells in GALT. The relative importance of these mechanisms for uptake of soluble antigens from the gut lumen in health and disease remains unknown; and the consequences in terms of sensitization or induction of oral tolerance probably depend on the route of uptake as well as on the nature of the antigen (soluble, lectin-hke, or particuiate). A detailed discussion of tbese possibilities is given elsewhere (27, 50, 322), Putative mechanisms of immune ehminaUon It may be envisioned that IgA antibodies contribute to local homeostasis not only by performing immune exclusion on the mucosal surface, hut also by trapping of antigens in the lamina propria (Fig. 29). Both these IgA-mediated blocking mechan-pIgA antihody from the basolateral side to the apical medium (44), Interestingly, monomeric IgA or IgG antibodies, when cross-linked via antigen to pIgA of the same specificity, could be included in the pIgR-mediated external transcytosis (44), Therefore, the secretory epithelium may participate in the clearance of immune complexes directly at the mucosal site where they are most likely to be formed. Additional IgA-mediateiJ putative homeostatic mechanisms Experimental evidence moreover suggests that IgA in several ways might influence local homeostasis through interaction with FcaRI (CD89) on leukocytes. By expressing its hgandbinding activity in the membrane-distal ECl domain (323), this receptor appears to be well designed for complexing with all molecular forms of IgA, Thus, monomeric IgA -and particularly pIgA or IgA-containing immune complexes -are able to suppress the attraction of neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes, thereby reducing the availability ofthe numerous potent inflammatory mediators that may be released from these cells (27). Also, IgA can downregulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a from activated monocytes (324), and perhaps that from lamina propria macrophages as well (Fig. 29), Finally, activation of neutrophils and monocytes resulting in generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (respiratory burst) might likewise be inhibited by IgA (325). On the other hand, pIgA or aggregated monomeric IgA can trigger resting monocytes :o show increased activity such as TNF-a secretion (326) and is also able to cause rather brisk degranulation of eosinophils (327). This proinflammatory potential of the local IgA system probably reflects a need for enhanced antigen elimination when immune exclusion fails (see below). Altogether, the divergent in vitro results emphasize the fact that the contribution of IgA to normal mucosal homeostasis in vivo must be remarkably fme-tuned. Individual variations in the development of mucosal homeostasis The postnatal development of the IgA-producing cell system shows large individual variations (143), On the basis of IgA measurements in serum, it has been suggested that infants and children at hereditary risk of atopy have a retarded post-natal developtnent of their IgA system (328, 329), Perhaps their SIgA-mediated immune exclusion and other noninflammatory of IgA-producing cells in jejunal mucosa of foodallergic children (331). More recently it was reported that infants born to atopic parents have a significantly higher prevalence of salivary IgA deficiency than age-matched control infants (332). Interestingly, Kilian et al. (333) found that the throats of 18-month-old infants with presumably IgF-mediated clinical problems, contained signiftcantly higher proportions of IgA 1 protease-producing bacteria than age-matched healthy controls. Therefore, a combination of reduced epithelial barrier function and hereditary elevated IgF responses might often underlie the pathogenesis of mucosal hypersensitivity, at least in many ofthe atopic children.",
