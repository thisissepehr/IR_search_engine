We present our successful experience with ECMO utilized in a respiratory failure patient with H7N9 infection. Case presentation: A 44 years-old female with H7N9-induced ARDS was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and was treated with veno-venous ECMO for six days, antiviral therapy, prolonged corticosteroid infusion and other therapies. She suffered significant hemorrhage requiring transfusion of platelets and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii infection during ECMO support. Bleeding and infection almost killed the patient's life. Fortunately, she was alive at last and completly recovered after 38 days of ICU stay. Conclusions: ECMO was effective in this H7N9 patient with a fatal respiratory failure. Mechanical circulatory support was the only chance for our patient with H7N9-associated ARDS to survive until respiratory function recovery.

The study found that fatality rate of patients with severe ARDS was as high as 62% [2] . Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a feasible life-saving support therapy for patients with severe ARDS that is refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation (MV) [3] . Originally applied to support the respiratory function of pediatric patients with good results [4] , the use of ECMO has been progressively extended to adult population [5] . Key factors for the indication of ECMO are represented by prognosis of the underlying disease, timing, quality of life of survivors and the possibility of being lung transplant candidate [6] .

However, indications for VV-ECMO are not unequivocal and it is highly invasive, presenting several specific problems and intellectual concepts that require understanding in caring for these patients.

Since mechanical ventilation by tracheal intubation could not improve patient with hypoxia, soon organ failure must occur in brain, heart, liver, kidneys and other vital organs of high oxygen demand. Emergency VV-ECMO partial instead of lung ventilation and oxygenation rapidly improved oxygen supplement of the body organs. It avoided the occurrence of multiple organ failure, decreased support of respiratory machine, reduced ventilator-associated lung injury, for lungs to get adequate rest, thus won time for treatment of the primary disease. Evidence supporting ECMO as life saving treatment for adults with respiratory failure are growing [10] . However, ECMO is a costly intervention that may carry the risk of futility and serious side effects such as major bleeding and infection. During ECMO support, as heparin must be applied at the same time, so thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy inevitably arise in patients. ECMO was started at 13:20 on March 13 for our patient, dramatic decrease in platelets (PLT 48x10 9 /L) was found on March 15. Skin ecchymosis was appeared in the groin where catheters were placed on March 19, subcutaneous hemorrhage occurred in fingers and left thigh of the patient, platelet had fallen to 21 \u00d7 10 9 /L. But more worrying was that bloody liquid was sucked out from bronchi and platelet transfusion did not work. Through discussion with experts, ECMO was withdrawn at 17:05 on March 19, and thrombopoietic treatment and platelet monitoring were continued, finally, the platelet returned to the normal range on April 3. Infection is another side effect of the application of ECMO.

It was also important to discover in time and rapid response serious ECMO-associated complications. Our patient was cured and went back to her previous quality of life at last, thanks to ECMO giving her time to get treatment. This case suggests that a multidisciplinary team, involving critical care and infectious diseases experts, is very critical to define whether ECMO is an adequate therapeutic option also in patients with severe pulmonary infectious diseases. We recommend treatment with ECMO as early as possible, but more clinical evidence is required to support this view. Further studies are needed to understand how to best utilize and optimize ECMO therapy in patients with ARDS. In short, our successful treatment of patients with severe H7N9 avian flu should be credited to application of ECMO and important ventilation adjustment according to patient's condition.
