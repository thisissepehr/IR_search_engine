With South Africa currently starting up introduction of a new triple combination regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine (3TC), and dolutegravir (TLD) [37, 38] , some progress in stemming resistance to NNRTI could be imminent. However, even with availability of the new regimen, routine monitoring of resistance remains critical [39] . Finally, circulating drug-resistant viruses may have implications for persons initiating PrEP with TDF/ FTC. The few seroconversions among individuals enrolled in PrEP trials occurred among those who started PrEP during unrecognized acute HIV infection, and the emergence of resistance primarily involved M184V/I, which can be selected for under the selective pressure of FTC [40] [41] [42] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 368, "end": 372, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 373, "end": 376, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 546, "end": 550, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 929, "end": 933, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 934, "end": 938, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 939, "end": 943, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A strength of this study is the population-based sample in an understudied area with data on viral load, ART analytes, and DRMs. Our data also has several limitations. Only 70% of the samples were sequenced, with failure being highest for those not suppressed on ART and with comparatively lower viral load measures, which could lead to an underestimation of DRMs if that population is intermittently adherent. Studies restricted to ART-na\u00efve populations using the same medium for genotyping have sequencing success of closer to 92% [43] . Additionally, ART initiation and adherence are based on self-report; however, the use of analyte data as a biological marker of initiation and adherence improves the study's accuracy. We cannot distinguish between acquired and transmitted resistance in our data, and, finally, we used DBS instead of plasma for the assays. Though DBS offer a feasible, low-resource alternative for viral load and DRM surveillance, they have well documented limitationsnotably cellular HIV DNA contributes to copy number when using whole blood instead of blood plasma samples [29] . We therefore used a conservative threshold of 5000 copies/mL for defining viral suppression, and, as a result, run the risk of overestimating viral suppression. Even so, viral suppression in this study aligns well with data from the NHLS at the time of the study, which suggested that viral suppression among PLHIV in care (defined as < 400 copies/mL plasma) ranged from 52 to 75% for North West Province, depending on the district [44] , similar to our estimates among those on treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 533, "end": 537, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1102, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1541, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We found that both non-adherence and drug resistance mutations likely play a key role in virologic failure in this rural community in North West Province, South Africa.

There is growing evidence that pre-treatment drug resistance is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa [22, 23] , making it essential that policies around treatment regimens are reviewed and updated frequently, and that surveillance be instituted in both HIV-positive, ARTna\u00efve populations and among those failing treatment, including monitoring of drug exposure for non-adherence and treatment failure despite adherence.
