Using the former figure and assuming a constant rate of divergence, it can be calculated that variants of the same genotype, e.g., HCV-BK and HCV-J that differ by 9%, diverged approximately 30 years ago, whereas subtypes (20% to 23% sequence difference) diverged 70 to 80 years ago.

In some cases, a tendency for substitution of similar amino acids can be observed (for example, leucine for isoleucine, aspartate for glutamate), but it is difficult to generalize much further than this. The restraint on sequence change would presumably differ in each protein, and would depend on whether the substituted residues were functionally critical (i.e., part of a n active enzymatic site) or not. Functional constraints on protein sequences may change through time. For example, HCV may have encountered different selection pressures on spread by different routes of transmission, and perhaps into different hosts, leading to increases or decreases in the degree of functional constraint acting on each amino acid residue.
