(Only two of them, the leukoviruses and herpesviruses, cause cancer in nonlaboratory situations.) All the members of these groups of viruses form integrated viral DNA in infected cells. However, the efficiencies with which they cause cancer vary by over a dozen orders of magnitude. These differences in efficiency are a result of differences in efficiency of formation and expression of the genes for neoplastic transformation. Four models of mechanisms for formation of the genes for neoplastic transformation are presented. Two involve the formation of new DNA sequences. N o efficient human cancer-causing viruses are known. Therefore, it is proposed that human cancer is a result of formation of the genes for neoplastic transformation by misevolution of a normal cellular information transferring process. This misevolution is caused by chemicals, physical agents, or viruses.",

There is a large difference in the efficiency of tumor formation by a strongly transforming RNA tumor virus (leukovirus) like Rous sarcoma virus and by a probably nontransforming R N A tumor virus (leukovirus) like Rous-associated virus-0. Both Rous sarcoma virus and Rous-associated virus-0 apparently form integrated nuclear viral DNA. T h e difference in efficiency of tumor formation must have another cause. I suggest that the difference in efficiency of tumor formation reflects a difference in the efficiency of formation or expression of the genes for cancer in the infected cells.

This mechanism would lead to cancer only when the virus integrates at a special site in the cellular DNA. Such a mechanism may be operative for polyoma virus.

T h e difference between Models 2 and 3 involves the presence of the new DNA sequences. T h e new sequences could be formed at the time of integration of the viral DNA Diagram of virus complementation experiment. Chicken embryo fibroblasts were infected with two different strains of B77 virus temperature-sensitive for neoplastic transformation (top), or with one of these B77 viruses and one strain of Prague Rous sarcoma virus temperature-sensitive for neoplastic transfonnation (bottom). T h e presence or absence of morphological transformation a t the nonpermissive temperature, 41C, was measured. (Wyke, 1973).22 or during subsequent replication of this integrated viral DNA. I n Model 4, the genes for neoplastic transformation are neither in the virus DNA nor in DNA which is next to the virus DNA. The genes for neoplastic transformation are in another place in the cell genome and, again as in Model 3, involve new DNA sequences. These new sequences are formed after integration of the viral DNA as a result of the action of viral products on the host DNA. (A popular recent hypothesis, the oncogene hypothesis, is somewhat like Model 4. But in the oncogene hypothesis the genes for neoplastic transformation are present in all normal cells.4 Since there has been no evidence in support of this hypothesis, and since there are strong theoretical arguments against it, for example, the lack of selective pressure to maintain these genes in all cells,lR I have not illustrated it.NEW DNA SEQUENCES Some of these models require the formation of new DNA sequences. There is now a fair amount of evidence that indicates that new DNA sequences exist in RNA tumor viruses. These experiments involve both genetic experiments and nucleic acid hybridization.",
