Aneurysm coiling followed by clot evacuation may be an alternative treatment. : A retrospective review was conducted of SAH patients between 7/200-3/2009. Inclusion criteria were: aneurysmal SAH, ICH>30ml or with midline shift>5mm, and candidacy for surgical clot evacuation. The Mann Whitney-U nonparametric test or Fisher exact test was used to compare demographic and radiographic criteria, time to aneurysm protection, 3-month functional outcome (categorized as dead or GOS 1-3), length of stay (LOS), and treatment complications of patients who underwent coiling followed by clot evacuation (group A) versus clipping with evacuation (group B). SAH patients, 10 underwent coiling followed by clot evacuation and 8 underwent clip with clot evacuation. Compared to Group B, Group A had a lower GCS score (median 5.5 versus 7.5), higher ICH score (median 3 versus 2), worse modified Fisher score (median 4 versus 3) and higher rate of herniation at admission (50% versus 25%). The median time to aneurysm protection was significantly shorter in Group A (299 versus 885 minutes, P<0.001).Comparing group A to B, the rates of death (30% versus 25%), poor outcome (70% versus 50%), median ICU LOS (20 versus 22 days), median hospital LOS (27 versus 29 days) and total median direct costs ($64,537 versus $61,243) were similar (all P=NS). Complications of treatment occurred in 1 patient in group A and 0 in group B (P=1.00) and residual aneurysm occurred in 1 patient in each group (P=1.00).

Prompt recognition of EEG seizures by bedside caregivers may be facilitated by displaying quantitative EEG trends at the bedside. Our aim was to compare the utility of one such trending tool, Color Density Spectral Array (CDSA), for seizure identification in the hands of EEG experts versus bedside ICU nurses. : 27 continuous EEGs performed in a pediatric ICU were transformed into 8-channel CDSA displays. Three neurophysiologists, 3 EEG technologists and 2 bedside nurses underwent training on the use of CDSA for seizure identification. Participants were then presented with CDSA displays of all EEG recordings and asked to mark events that they suspected to be seizures. Their performance was then compared to seizures identified by a board-certified electroencephalographer on the raw 13-21 channel EEG.Results:The 27 EEG recordings contained 553 discrete seizures over 487 hours.
