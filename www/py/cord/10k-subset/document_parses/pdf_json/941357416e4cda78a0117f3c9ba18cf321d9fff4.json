Patients with pneumonia were older and were more likely to have certain underlying medical conditions than patients without pneumonia. Patients with pneumonia were also more likely to have a prolonged hospital stay, be admitted to an ICU, require mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, and die. While patients with pneumonia were more likely to receive antiviral therapy than those without pneumonia, treatment was more often delayed among patients with pneumonia. Similar to findings from smaller inter-pandemic studies [6, 7] pneumonia was common among adults hospitalized with influenza in this study. Among those hospitalized with influenza, older adults and nursing home residents were at significantly increased risk for having influenza-associated pneumonia. Respiratory viruses including influenza are a common etiology of pneumonia in older adults, and several factors may contribute to the development of severe lower respiratory tract disease in these individuals, including decreased respiratory muscle strength and lung compliance, and waning humoral and cell-mediated immunity [10] [11] [12] . Additional risk factors for lower respiratory tract disease among older nursing home residents include immobility and swallowing difficulties leading to aspiration [13] . Within closed settings such as nursing homes, large outbreaks of influenza and its subsequent complications, including severe pneumonia, may rapidly evolve and lead to significant morbidity and mortality [10, 14] .

Influenza vaccination is the most effective method to prevent influenza and its complications, and older adults, residents of nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities, and adults with underlying medical conditions should be considered high priority groups for receipt of annual influenza vaccination [15] . Similar to earlier studies conducted during periods of seasonal influenza virus circulation, patients with pneumonia in this study were more likely to have underlying medical conditions including chronic lung disease and heart disease [6, 7] . An unexpected finding was that patients with asthma in our analysis were less likely to have a diagnosis of pneumonia than patients without pneumonia. Our study results contrast with EIP surveillance data in hospitalized children <18 years of age which has shown that children with influenza-associated pneumonia were more likely to have asthma than those without pneumonia [16] . Studies of the association between asthma and seasonal influenza-associated pneumonia among adults are lacking. A possible explanation for our finding is that respiratory distress caused by influenza-associated asthma exacerbation provided an alternate reason for hospitalization in adult patients in the absence of pneumonia. Biases in hospital admission practices based on the presence of underlying conditions may have also contributed to admission of asthmatic patients with a less severe respiratory presentation compared to patients without underlying medical conditions. Invasive bacterial infections, especially due to S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, were observed among patients with influenza-associated pneumonia in this study as well as other studies conducted during inter-pandemic [7] and pandemic periods [17] . Among patients with pneumonia, S. aureus was the most common organism cultured from specimens collected from sterile sites. Influenza virus and S. aureus co-infections are increasing [18] [19] [20] and have been associated with particularly severe cases of community-acquired pneumonia during periods of seasonal influenza virus circulation [21] . In patients hospitalized with influenza, sterile site cultures should be collected as early as possible for detection of bacterial infection and empiric antimicrobial coverage of the most likely bacterial organisms should be considered [22, 23] . In our study, S. pneumoniae was the only organism to be cultured from a sterile site more frequently in patients with pneumonia that in patients without pneumonia. In addition to annual influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to adults aged 18-64 years with certain health conditions and to all persons aged \u226565 years [24] . Patients with influenza-associated pneumonia had a significantly increased risk of ICU admission, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and death compared with patients without pneumonia. While case series conducted during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated elevated frequencies of ICU admission (36-58 %) [25, 26] , respiratory failure (10-67 %) [25, 27] and death (7-39 %) [25] [26] [27] [28] among patients hospitalized with pandemic H1N1 influenza-associated pneumonia, limited data is available on the association between seasonal influenzaassociated pneumonia and severe outcomes. In a small case series of patients hospitalized with influenza during the 1999-2000 season, 10 (58 %) of 17 patients with pneumonia were admitted to the ICU and 5 (29 %) patients died [7] . In another observational study of patients hospitalized with influenza during 1999-2003, 16 (16 %) of 101 patients with acute pulmonary disease were admitted to the ICU, 10 (10 %) required mechanical ventilation, and 6 (6 %) died [6] . While pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been shown to account for a majority of deaths associated with influenza virus infection during pandemics [28] , data is limited on the association between seasonal influenza virus infection and death from pneumonia or ARDS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 784, "end": 787, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 788, "end": 790, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1358, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1363, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1368, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1539, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1750, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1754, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2020, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2380, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2618, "end": 2621, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2622, "end": 2624, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3001, "end": 3005, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3800, "end": 3803, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3825, "end": 3829, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4015, "end": 4019, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4020, "end": 4024, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4025, "end": 4029, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4173, "end": 4177, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 4416, "end": 4420, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 4421, "end": 4424, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4772, "end": 4776, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 5102, "end": 5106, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 5107, "end": 5110, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 5143, "end": 5147, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 5148, "end": 5151, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 5171, "end": 5175, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 5176, "end": 5180, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 5181, "end": 5185, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 5186, "end": 5190, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 5567, "end": 5570, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 5803, "end": 5806, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 5983, "end": 5987, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our analysis, only 55 % of patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza received influenza antiviral treatment.

Thus, these data may not be representative of all individuals hospitalized with influenza who may not have been tested or have laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. It is possible that patients included in surveillance were more likely to be tested for influenza because they were more severely ill; thus a higher proportion of patients exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms may have been tested for influenza than patients presenting with other symptoms. Furthermore, in our analysis, patients with pneumonia were compared to patients without pneumonia but with a wide array of other diagnoses. Clinican influenza testing practices based on patient diagnoses at presentation may have biased our findings. In one study conducted in an emergency department in Australia, patients presenting with fever and respiratory diagnoses were more likely to be tested for influenza than patients presenting with cardiac or other diagnoses [33] .

As a result, some individuals may have been misclassified as having pneumonia based upon a report of infiltrates or opacities, when in fact they had a more chronic pulmonary condition or a transient episode of pulmonary edema or effusion. There was no requirement regarding timing of identification of radiologic abnormalities during the hospitalization, and the timing of chest radiographs during the hospitalization was not collected as part of EIP surveillance; thus, some misclassification of communityacquired pneumonia versus nosocomial pneumonia may have occurred. Using ICD-9-CM code data may also have led to misclassification if a diagnosis code was listed incorrectly or not listed at all. A joint case definition for pneumonia which used both radiographic data and discharge diagnosis data from ICD-9-CM codes or discharge summaries was utilized to minimize some of these biases.
