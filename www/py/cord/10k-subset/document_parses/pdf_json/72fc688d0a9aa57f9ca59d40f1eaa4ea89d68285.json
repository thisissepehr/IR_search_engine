            "text": "EAV strains used in this study were as follows: Bucyrus (Ohio) [8] , modified Bucyrus [9, 14] , Red Mile (Kentucky) [t 5], 84 KY-A1 (Kentucky) [19] , Wroclaw-2 (Poland) [11] , Bibuna (Switzerland) [2] and Vienna (Austria) [3] . In addition, a modified live virus vaccine (Arvac) was used. All strains of EAV were propagated in an RK 13 rabbit kidney cell line. RNA was extracted from 250 gl of culture fluid with 500 gl of RNAzol B (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.). RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, using 2 gl of ethachinmate (Nippon gene Co., Japan) as a carrier. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 30 ILl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Six primers were selected from the coding region for the M protein. The structure of the EAV genome, the location of the primer pairs and the restriction sites used are shown in Fig. 1 . Upper primer; M1, 5'-CTGAGGTATGGGAGC- These mismatches were single internal mismatches, which probably had no significant effect on the PCR product yield. The mismatches in primer M9, M14, M6 and M10 were C:A (primer: template), A:C, C:T, and G:T, respectively. These mismatches were efficiently amplified even when located at the 3' end of the primer [13] . The sensitivity of PCR for detecting EAV was determined by using serial ten-fold dilutions of infected cell fluid with a modified Bucyrus strain (2 x 107 PFU/ml). The first round PCR using the M1-M10 primer pair generated a faint though visible 449 bp product at a dilution level of 10 -3, corresponding to about 500 PFU (Fig. 3A) . When the PCR product obtained from the first round PCR was reamplified with one of the three sets of inner primers M 1-M 14, M6-M8, or M9-M 10, all of the respective 231 bp, 247 bp and 241 bp products were detected at a 10 .6 dilution level of cell fluid (Fig. 3B) . The results showed that reamplification with the nested or hemi-nested primers increased sensitivity by at least 100-1000 times, enabling us to detect at a level of 0.5-5 PFU. However, amplified DNA was not detected when the first round PCR product was amplified using an equine herpesvirus (EHV)-1 gC primer, even though a 712 bp product of EHV was produced using the primer in the presence of an EHV genome (Fig. 3B) . The genome of EHV and equine influenza virus yielded no amplification band using the EAV primer pairs. Each of the PCR products amplified using the M 1-M 14 primer was digested with each of the four restriction enzymes; Xba I, Mva I, Mbo II, and Alu I. Digestion of PCR products from the Bucyrus, modified Bucyrus, live vaccine, and Wroclaw-2 strains with Xba I gave rise to fragments of about 174 bp and 57 bp (Fig. 4a) . Products from Red Mile and 84 KY-A1 digested with Mva I produced fragments of about 131 bp and 100 bp (Fig. 4b) . Digestion of PCR products with Mbo II gave rise to fragments of about 200 bp and 31 bp in all strains except for the Wroclaw-2 and Vienna strains (Fig. 4c) . The PCR products from all strains were cleaved by digestion with Alu I into two fragments of 164 bp and 67 bp. In Bibuna strain a 164 bp fragment was further cleaved into 110 bp and 54 bp fragments, allowing for three fragments of 110 bp, 67 bp and 54 bp to be produced (Fig. 4d) . Of the PCR products using M6-M8 primer only PCR products derived from modified Bucyrus and the live vaccine were digested by Hha I, to give fragments of about t 85 bp and 62 bp (Fig. 4e) . PCR products from 84 KY-A1 and Red Mile strains were shown to share the same fragment patterns by the above 5 restriction enzymes. (Fig. 4f) . The results of the digestion of PCR products using M1-M14, M6-M8, and M9-M10, with the appropriate restriction enzymes, are summarized in Table 1 . The Bucyrus, modified Bucyrus and live vaccine, the Red Mile and 84 KY-A1, and the Wroclaw-2, Bibuna and Vienna strains were differentiated by the digestion of PCR products using the M I -M 14 primer with the four restriction enzymes XbaI, Mva I, Mbo II and AluI. The modified Bucyrus strain and live vaccine were discriminated from the others by the digestion of their PCR products using the M6-M8 primer with Hha I. Ava II digestion of PCR products using M9-M10 enabled us to distinguish between the Red Mile and 84 KY-A1 strains.",

We selected oligonucleotide primers from the O R F 6 gene because it has been shown to be an area with a higher sequence homology than O R F 7 among the members of the Arterivirus group [6, 16, 17] . We designed primer pairs so that there would be no mismatches or at most, a single base pair mismatch, and ensured that the area of amplification product contained the strain specific restriction site for the endonuclease. [5] . There were some differences in the M gene nucleotide sequence of Kentuncky 84 and Wroclaw-2 isolates from our data. If the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns determined by the 6 restriction enzymes are assessed according to their nucleotide sequences, Pleurat Fluid, MAFF Ireland, 185/83, NEA V2, Kentucky 84, and Wroclaw-2 isolates should show the same RFLP patterns as the Bucyrus isolate. These isolates exhibited a 96-98% nucleotide identity with Bucyrus isolate [5] . However, our RFLP patterns were exactly as predicted from our nucleotide sequence data.",

The restriction site ofHha I in the M6-M8 amplified area seems to be unique to the live vaccine, Arvac, and to the modified Bucyrus strains, according to our study and to reports by Chirnside et al. [5] . Fukunaga et al. demonstrated some serological differences between the modified Bucyrus strain and the Bucyrus, 84 KY-A1, and Wroclaw-2 strains using a serum cross neutralization test [10] . The differentiation between horses vaccinated with live vaccine and horses infected with wild strain should be reliable through RFLP analysis by using restriction sites from other ORFs, such as ORF 2, 4, and 5, in combination with serological differentiation using the neutralization. The application of PCR for EAV detection in clinical samples is presently under investigation.",

The tube was incubated at 42 \u00b0C for t 5 min, at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, and at 5 \u00b0C for 5 rain. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 100 p.1 containing 20 p.1 of cDNA, 4 p.1 of MgC12 (25 mM), 2 gl of 10 x PCR buffer, 1 gl of upper stream primer (20 gM), 0.5 gl of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (5U). The mixture was incubated at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94 \u00b0C for 1 min) and annealing (60 \u00b0C for 1 min), and a final extension (60 \u00b0C for 7 min). Double nested PCR amplification was carried out using the external primer M 1 -M 10 and various sets of inner primers. The second round amplification was carried out in a 50 gl reaction mixture containing 5 gl of t0 x PCR buffer, 0.2 U/gl ofTaq polymerase, 2 mM of MgC12, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 gM of each inner primer and 1 gl of the first round PCR product. Denaturation and annealing consisted of 35 cycles 94 \u00b0C for 1 rain, and 60 \u00b0C for I rain, respectively, followed by a 7 min extension at 60 \u00b0C. Using the primer pairs ofM 1-M 10, M 1-M 14, M6-M8, or M9-M 10, RNA from each of the strains and the live vaccine was equally and efficiently amplified producing a band of 449 bp, 231 bp, 247 bp, and 241 bp, respectively (Fig. 2). However, there was a single base mismatches in the M9 and MI4 regions of the modified Bucyrus strain, in M6 of the Vienna strain, in M8 of the Bibuna and Vienna strains, and in M10 of the Bibuna strain.",
