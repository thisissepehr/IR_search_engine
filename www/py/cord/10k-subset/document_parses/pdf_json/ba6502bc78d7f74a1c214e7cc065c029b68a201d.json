Experiments using elevated growth temperature to block post-translational cleavage have demonstrated two additional high molecular weight protein bands 125 kd and 123 kd respectively which may be precursor polyproteins. Inhibition of proteolytic processing with p-ftuorophenylalanine ted to the accumulation of several additional protein species which may represent intermediates in the protein processing pathway. None of these proteins were related to the 62 kd major capsid protein (cP 62) of the virus as judged by reaction with monoclonal antibodies. The production of a 76 kd capsid precursor protein (cpP 76) was demonstrated for the first time in FCV-infected cells. The pathway by which calicivirus polypeptides are made thus appears highly complex and may involve temporal regulation of protein synthesis as well as protein processing. Tentative identification of primary, intermediate and mature forms of virus proteins is discussed.",

            "text": "The caliciviruses are a group of positive stranded RNA viruses which resemble in many respects the picornaviruses with which they were originally classified [8, 9] . The particles of both virus groups are non-enveloped icosahedral capsids enclosing a single molecule of positively stranded RNA to which a protein (VpG) is covalently attached at the 5'end. Both groups have members which replicate in the gut or respiratory tract and, in both types of virus, proteins mature by a process of proteolytic cleavage. However, the replication cycle of the caliciviruses differs from that of the picornaviruses in that no single large polyprotein precursor to all virus proteins is known. Instead the virus produces a 3'-nested set of mRNAs which resembles that of the coronaviruses [6] . As yet the coding strategy and specificities of these mRNAs are unknown.",

Using inhibitors of proteolysis they also identified a 120kd short-lived precursor molecule. The second analysis, by Komotaffe [4] , failed to confirm the presence of P 100, but inferred the existence of two proteins of 80 kd.

Monolayers were then washed three times in PBS, covered in fresh medium and incubated at 37 \u00b0C before cells were harvested at the times described and processed for electrophoresis as follows: The cell sheets were washed with PBS and scraped into ice-cold saline. Cells were briefly pelleted in a microfuge, resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 2 rain and frozen at -20 \u00b0C for storage. Samples were syringed to shear DNA before analysis on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel [5] . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting. This was performd using a \"Bio-Rad Transblot cell\" as described by Samson et al. [7] . Following transfer any excess capacity for protein adsorption to the filter was blocked by an overnight incubation in phosphate buffered saline supplemented with Tween-20 (0.05% v/v) and 1% bovine serum albumin. Blots were stained in two ways: Serum from a cat immunized with the feline calicivirus \"Catavac\" vaccine (obtained from Prof. O. Jarrett, Glasgow Veterinary School) was diluted 500-fold in PBS-Tween containing 5% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, and allowed to bind to proteins on the filter for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Blots were then washed three times for 15 min each in PBS-Tween, and treated with a 1 : 1,000 dilution of Goat anti-cat Immunoglobulin (Miles) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Following this treatment, the filters were washed as before and reacted with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin (Miles) diluted 1 : 1,000 in the same buffer. Washing was repeated and the bands visualized by the cotour reaction of 4-chtoro-napthol (Sigma Chemicals, Poole) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as described [7] . Alternatively, blots were stained using a 1:1,000 dilution of capsid protein specific monoclonal antibody 1 G 9 or 1 E 1 [2] diluted in PBS-Tween 20, washed as above and reacted with the same dilution of peroxidase-conjugated FCV proteins 71 rabbit anti-murine immunoglobulin (Miles) in the same buffer. Finally, blots were washed again and developed as above. Protein molecular weight markers (BDH UK) were separated alongside experimental samples, transferred to nitrocellulose and cut as a strip from the blot before the protein blocking stage. These strips were then stained with \"Pelican\" India ink diluted 1 : 500 in PBS-Tween 20.",

Since these animals undergo a productive infection following vaccination, serum from this source should recognize non-structural as well as structural virus proteins. All polypeptides migrated with lower apparent molecular weights in 10% gels than those previously derived in 15% gels [2] . The single capsid protein of the virus (cP 62) was observed from as early as 1 h p.i. Levels remained steady at first but began to increase from 3 h onwards. A non-structural 75 kd polypeptide (P 75) was also detected at this early time and behaved similarly. There were indications of a slightly smaller (73 kd) protein band (P 73). This protein was difficult to detect and did not persist. Although at very low levels, it was reproducibly present at early times and was no longer detectable in the cells by 3 h p.i. (Fig.  1 a, b) . The general level of virus protein accumulation within the cell increased dramatically from 3 h p.i. Cellular degeneration progressed rapidly beginning at 4 h p.i. and was accompanied by release of infectious virus progeny. Several other virus proteins were also observed from 3 h onward. Two larger proteins, 96 and 84 kd (designated P 96 and P 84) and minor amounts of a third band at 98kd were detected, as were 3 smaller bands; 39kd, 36kd, and 27.5kd (designated P 39, P 36, and P 27). Two minor species (70 kd and 49 kd) were also seen at late times (4-5 h p.i.) which were designated P 70 and P49.

Both antibodies recognized the capsid protein and both revealed the same general increase in the levels of this protein from 3 h p.i. and onwards. A typical result is presented (Fig. 1 c) . Neither antibody recognized any of the other proteins present in the infected cell during the period studied. The capsid protein of SMSV is known to mature by processing a larger (86 kd) precursor [3] . This molecule cannot be detected in the infected cell unless measures are taken to prevent its cleavage. Fretz and Schaffer [3] achieved this by conducting the infection at 42 \u00b0C. No such precursor has been described during FCV infection and it was surprising that it could not be detected during infection at 37 \u00b0C, even with the sensitive means provided by monoclonal antibodies. It was possible therefore that capsid protein synthesis might differ between caliciviruses or alternatively cleavage could be so rapid that levels of any precursor were not detectable even by these sensitive means. In order to examine this and any processing involved in the synthesis or maturation of the other virus proteins it was necessary to inhibit protein processing during virus replication. Two procedures were used, elevated temperature and treatment with the drug p-fluorophenylalanine.",

Infected cells were treated with FPA or temperature elevation as described in the text and processed for Western blotting. Bands were detected using polyclonal immune cat serum and tracks are labelled according to the treatment received. Protein bands are as designated in the text separated on a polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose before detection with immune cat serum (Fig. 3) . The proteins detected in the 37 \u00b0C infection were as expected from the foregoing discussion, P 96, P 84, P 75, P 70, cP 62 (capsid), and the three low molecular weight proteins P 39, P 36, and P 27. Similarly transfer to 42 \u00b0C led to the accumulation of the expected proteins characteristic of that treatment, that is P 125, P 123 and low amounts of P 112. The cluster of species at approximately 75 kd which includes cpP 76 was not well resolved on this gel. Treatment with FPA however caused an obvious difference in the polypeptide patterns observed. There were greatly increased levels of P 84 and P 70, and P 96 appeared as an obvious double band. The lower component of this doublet co-migrated with P 96 from a normal 37 \u00b0C infection, and the upper band co-migrated with that observed at 42 \u00b0C (P 98). Addition of FPA inhibited the development of virus-induced cpe completely despite the fact that induction of the late polypeptides had occurred. Transfer to elevated temperature largely prevented the increase in cpe which occurs between 3 and 4 h p.i., and release of progeny virus. 76 M.J. Carter FCV-infected cells were also treated with FPA at 42 \u00b0C, this procedure led to the production of proteins indistinguishable from those produced by growth at 42 \u00b0C alone (data not shown).",

            "text": "It is clear that FCV replication is a complex process which may involve temporal regulation of protein synthesis. We suggest that unlike the picornaviruses, the caliciviruses may have two phases of protein synthesis. The early production of P 75 corresponds to the first, there is also evidence for the transient production of P 73 which is cleared from the cells by 3 h p.i. Since these proteins do not react with capsid protein-specific antibodies, they are unlikely to be precursors to capsid protein. P 75 and P 73 are the earliest proteins detected no precursors or products have been identified. Komolaffe et al. [-4] were able to infer the existence of a short-lived protein of about this molecular weight from their experiments, but could not separate it from a longer-lived molecule of the same size--here designated P75. Antiserum used by these workers was unable to recognize these proteins efficiently and so they could not detect them in the early stages of infection. Capsid protein detected at early times presumably represents infecting virus since no precursor to this protein can be detected before 2 h p.i. Metabolic labelling studies have also failed to detect capsid protein synthesis at these early stages of infection [4] . Virus proteins begin to increase in quantity and accumulate in the cell from 3 h p.i. onwards. This coincides with the onset of synthesis of P 125, 123, and cpP76 which are not detectable unless proteolytic processing is inhibited and marks the beginning of the late phase. P 125 and P 123 are the largest products detectable intracellutarly. A single species of this size has been observed under similar conditions [1] . In this report, we have resolved this band into two, neither of which is related to the capsid protein as judged by monoclonal antibody recognition. Pulse chase experiments and salt shock procedures led Black and Brown [1] to a similar conclusion in the case of FCV and Fretz and Schaffer in the case of SMSV [3] . The largest protein related to the capsid is cpP 76.",

It is therefore difficult to be certain which of the intracellular proteins represent mature forms and which are simply processing intermediates, but it seems likely in view of their accumulation that P 96, P 75, P 39, P 36, and P 27 are indeed final forms. P 84, P 70, and P 49 are only observed faintly towards the end of infection when cellular damage has accumulated. The breakdown in cellular organization occurring at this time could lead to disruption of the protein synthesis and maturation system, and the consequent accumulation of intermediate forms of the virus proteins. Further information on this point may be derived from a consideration of the proteins observed in FPA-treated FCV-infected cells. The proteins observed in FPA-treated infected cells at 42 \u00b0C are the same as those made at this temperature in the absence of the drug. Drug treatment alone, however, allows the simultaneous accumulation of proteins seen at both elevated and normal temperatures and leads to an increase in the amounts of P 84 and P 70. It is likely that FPA and increased temperature both inhibit protein processing, but that inhibition by FPA may be less efficient than that by temperature elevation. Consequently the normally short-lived precursor molecules P 125, P 123, P98, and cpP76 are observed in the presence of the drug, but limited and inefficient processing could allow the accumulation of intermediate forms normally only detected when cellular integrity is extensively damaged. Thus we tentatively identify P 84 and P 70 as intermediate forms in protein maturation. It seems likely that P 49 and P 112 may also constitute intermediate forms since they are similarly detecte d in low amounts late in infection.",
