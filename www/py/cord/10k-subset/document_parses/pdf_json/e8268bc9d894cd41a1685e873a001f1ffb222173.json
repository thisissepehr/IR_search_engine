Paradoxically, our results show immediate benefits of the LR strategy, despite the absence of improved clearance of lung fluid that occurs during vaginal delivery [35] . Until recently, one of the described mechanisms of airway liquid clearance at birth was Na + uptake across the airway epithelium. However, this cellular mechanism develops only in late gestation [36] , and is too slow to clear the volume of liquid to be expelled within seconds to minutes after birth from airways. Therefore, the airway liquid clearance after birth is thought to result from an increase in the transepithelial pressure gradient, occurring during inspiration, which is incompletely effective in premature neonates [7] .
