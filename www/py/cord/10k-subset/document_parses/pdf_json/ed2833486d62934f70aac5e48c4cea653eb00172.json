A multiplex molecular approach potentially simplifies testing algorithms and laboratory workflow, as well as increases the likelihood that an actionable diagnosis will not be missed. Multiplex assays significantly increase diagnostic yield (ie, number of organism detections), largely due to the fact that they target potential pathogens not routinely identified by traditional methods. In addition, multiplex PCRs are generally more sensitive than routine culture or antigen detection. The limitations of current multiplex tests are that they no not detect all potential pathogens and that a negative panel result does not entirely exclude infection.

The potential for false-positive results from PCR amplicon carryover contamination is a major concern for the highcomplexity platforms that involve manipulation of amplified PCR products. Even with fully integrated, closed systems, there is potential to contaminate raw specimens with viruses shed by the respiratory tract of the operator. Laboratories must carefully follow operating procedures designed to minimize the contamination of specimens, work surfaces, and equipment. This can be a major challenge when testing is performed outside of a dedicated molecular diagnostics section. For near patient testing, consideration should be given to manipulating specimens in a biological safety cabinet that can be cleaned and kept separate from positive control material.
