While landscape epidemiology studies have shed light on many aspects of disease distribution and risk differentials across geographies, new computational methods combined with new data sources such as citizen sensors, global spatial datasets, sensor networks, and growing availability and variety of satellite imagery offer opportunities for a more integrated approach to understanding these relationships. Additionally, a large number of new modelling and mapping methods have been developed in recent years to support the adoption of these new tools. The complexity of this research context results in study-dependent solutions and prevents landscape approaches from deeper integration into operational models and tools. In this paper we consider three common research contexts for spatial epidemiology; surveillance, modelling to estimate a spatial risk distribution and the need for intervention, and evaluating interventions and improving healthcare. A framework is proposed and a categorization of existing methods is presented. A case study into leptospirosis in Sri Lanka provides a working example of how the different phases of the framework relate to real research problems. The new framework for geocomputational landscape epidemiology encompasses four key phases: characterizing assemblages, characterizing functions, mapping interdependencies, and examining outcomes. Results from Sri Lanka provide evidence that the framework provides a useful way to structure and interpret analyses.

Firstly, the emergence and re-emergence of infectious pathogens over the last few decades has re-emphasized the importance of local exposures and risks, whether due to environmental or communicable transmission processes that result from complex assemblages of local and globalscale processes. Secondly, spatially explicit models of infectious diseases have been developed at a range of spatial and temporal scales-from household-level models of infectious disease spread (Riley 2007) , to global models of the factors driving the spatial distribution of zoonotic pathogens (Jones et al. 2008) . These models require spatial datasets describing every aspect of disease risk from wind patterns to health-seeking behaviours. The use of geographic information systems (GIS) is critical to the building and operation of spatially explicit disease risk models. Finally, spatial modelling has been improved by the concurrent rise in sources of geographical data to support such modelling efforts across all scales (though not all diseases). The importance of the 'landscape' in emerging, zoonotic, and infectious disease literatures is widely recognized from both a substantive perspective due to greater interdependencies between populations (Khan et al. 2009 ), incursion into natural areas (e.g., Field et al. 2001) , intensification of livestock production (Gerber et al. 2005; Graham et al. 2008) , wildlife trade (Karesh et al. 2005) as well as more practical considerations due to the abundant data and technologies now available (e.g., Vitolo et al. 2015) .

Recent advances in understanding of how knowledge is adopted in decision-support contexts, and the translation of knowledge to specific communities of users in application of health research and technologies has shed light on the importance of the types of knowledge and expertise required to make this transaction possible (Straus et al. 2011) .

Also, these data products are increasingly available at a global scale, and as 'pre-processed' information products consumable by spatial models.

We are on the cusp of real-time global-scale epidemiology, whereby 'feeds' describing the important features of the environment for health is updated in real-time. For diseases with immediate environmental components of risk (e.g., arboviruses, heat-related illnesses), the benefits of timely updating of spatially explicit information on risk factors provide opportunities for highly granular public health responses and data-driven policy formulations. Further, diseases with longer latencies and more complex risk profiles also stand to benefit from enhanced environmental information.

The shortcomings of GIS approaches to health research and specifically the disconnect between analytical methods and parameters such as neighbourhood weights matrices in disease mapping models, and their epidemiological meaning was highlighted by Yang et al.

And while the emphasis in health geography over the last two decades has focused largely on social determinants (Kearns 1993; Kearns and Moon 2002) , these approaches have bifurcated somewhat from approaches dominant in spatially oriented infectious disease epidemiology, which have remained quantitative and modelling/biomedically oriented. Rather than debate the relative merits of these paradigms, it is instructive to re-examine the motivation for these studies in the first place, and perhaps contextualize these differing research frames within a common framework. Recent work relating infectious disease risk to climate change has introduced ideas from adaptation research such as vulnerability and adaptive capacity that are conditioned on socioeconomic processes (Kienberger and Hagenlocher 2014) is an example of a new generation of integrative spatial studies of health and disease that may be bridging this gap.

However, given the increasingly granularity of satellite data, the volume of mobile sensor data, and the advent of 'big data' generally (and real-time epidemiology), these technologies are starting to become insufficient to handle the current data-rich environment. New geocomputational methods for spatial data storage and access may be required for new research in landscape epidemiology-including spatial indexes, data compression algorithms, and knowledge discovery algorithms. For example, social media data streams are by definition 'always on'-and extracting and storing a subset of these defined by space and time into a relational database for the purposes of on-line surveillance of new disease reports induces a delay in the processing chain. Application programming interfaces (APIs) as a way of accessing data portals algorithmically partially sidestep this issue, but these tools are by their nature reserved for researchers with advanced technical skills. Consequently, the 'data processing step' is an increasingly relevant but frequently overlooked component of LE studies, as data integration based on geography is often required prior to undertaking any analysis. Complex processing chains that incorporate web-based geographic data repositories, cloud-based storage and analysis, and delivery of results via web-map services may encompass the computational tools of neogeography (e.g., OpenLayers, cartoDB, D3, leaflet), open data portals and cloud services (e.g., Amazon EC2) and a myriad other software tools and packages.

Geocomputational methods are well-suited to multi-scale analysis, however there are several approaches to multi-scale analysis that can be taken, and little guidance is available to researchers aiming to take a multi-scale approach to LE. Characterizing features of the landscape at multiple scales is perhaps one of the most widely employed tactics, whether it is compositional factors (e.g., percent forest cover) or configurational properties (e.g., edge density, fragmentation). Identifying 'zones' of scale consistency and abrupt changes in landscape properties with scale can provide insight into the appropriate spatial scale of investigation (Wu 2004 ).

Examples of flows include the movement of mosquito vectors with climate change, movement of cattle to markets in a region, commuting patterns of residents of a large metropolitan area, and the flow of capital into resource extraction industries in individual countries or regions. While we don't constrain our description to physical flows (e.g., diurnal movement of people within the city), we emphasize aspects of flows that can be represented and or analyzed within a geocomputational framework. Often, non-geographic flows have important properties and expressions that are embedded within geographic space. For example, the use of social network analysis in recent years has increased-in order to identify physical contact tracing and exposure/transmission opportunities, but also to model the flow of knowledge about public health-related factors such as health-promoting activities or risk perceptions within and between vulnerable communities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 544, "end": 550, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Characterize functions"}, {"text": "In complex systems, feedbacks are defined as those components of a system that engage in or foster learning and exhibit behavior. In geocomputation, learning and behavior are increasingly relevant concepts, as algorithms are developed that learn relationships across space from continuous data streams (Young 2013 ). Many of the dynamical models of mathematical modelling center on feedbacks between system components, and estimation of critical epidemiological parameters. While geography has traditionally been excluded or assumed away in these models, the field of spatial statistics has developed spatially explicit extensions to classical epidemiological models (Riley et al. 2015) . However, for LE the majority of approaches that are focused on representing connectivity and positive and negative feedback between system components fall into the category of conceptual modelling approaches rather than empirical/mathematical modelling.

The bacterial spirochaete (i.e., leptospira) that gives rise to the disease in humans have a large number of animal reservoirs, including cattle, rodents and foxes. The bacteria are passed from animal reservoirs to the environment through urine-where they can then infect humans. In Sri Lanka, leptospirosis is historically associated with rice agriculture. Transmission occurs when open wounds or skin abrasions come into contact with urine from infected rodents (giving rise to the local name 'rat fever'). Diagnostic facilities are limited and the clinical presentation is similar to Hantavirus infections (Gamage et al. 2011; Sunil-Chandra et al. 2015) , and only a fraction of suspected cases are tested. A large outbreak of suspected leptospirosis occurred in Sri Lanka in 2008. The reasons for the outbreak remain speculative, but are hypothesized to be at least partially due to expanded cultivation of paddy field areas that resulted from policies aimed at increasing domestic rice production. As part of the programme 'Api Vavamu, Rata Nagamu', unused fertile lands were targeted for food production among landholders, many which had not traditionally been involved in farming. The development of this program was a direct response to the global rise in food prices that began accelerating in 2007, with international price of rice increasing 250 % between 2007 (Kelegama 2010 .
