[2] [3] [4] One mechanism by which NAbs against soluble self-antigens may play a regulatory role is by targeting self-antigens to APCs and thereby affecting self-antigen presentation to T cells. It is likely that NAbs of IgG isotype are capable of directing captured self-antigens to Fc -receptor expressing APCs. 56 Similarly, NAbs of IgM or IgA isotype may direct self-antigens to B cells and macrophages, expressing the Fc / receptor. 57 All these events may promote presentation of self-antigens to autoreactive T cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 363, "end": 366, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 367, "end": 370, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 371, "end": 374, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 677, "end": 679, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 801, "end": 803, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 70, "end": 77, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "IMMUNOREGULATORY NAbs AGAINST NON-CYTOKINE SELF-ANTIGENS"}, {"text": "One of the self-antigens against which NAbs have been most frequently described is thyroglobulin (TG). In a serum-free environment, a subset comprising 2-4% of normal, circulating B cells is capable of binding TG (this subset presumably represents B cells with polyreactive surface immunoglobulins), while TG binds to the entire B-cell population in the presence of autologous serum. 58 The binding can be substantially inhibited by immunoabsorption of TG-reactive autoantibodies from serum or by heat inactivation of serum complement, suggesting that formation of complement-activating ICs promoted the binding of TG to the B cells. In accordance with this hypothesis, blockade of complement receptors 1 (CR1/CD35) and 2 (CR2/CD21) reduced the binding of TG to B cells by > 90%, and addition of TG to preparations of normal mononuclear cells suspended in sera from healthy individuals lead to increased deposition of C3-fragments on B cells. 58, 59 In accordance with these findings using TG as model self-antigen, Thornton et al. showed that normal serum contains NAbs with reactivity against the primary antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and that ICs formed with these NAbs are capable of fixing fragments of complement component 3 (C3) and bind to B cells via CR1 and CR2 (Fig. 1B) . 60, 61 They further demonstrated that expression of the T-cell co-stimulatory molecule CD80 by B cells required a secondary ligation of IC-associated IgG to Fc RII. 60 It is widely accepted that B cells bearing specific antigen-receptors efficiently take up and present antigens to T cells (Fig. 1A) . 62 As outlined, non-specific B cells may also engage in antigen presentation provided for the antigen in question is incorporated in complement-opsonized ICs and thereby targeted to CR1, CR2 and Fc RII (Fig. 1B) . 60, 61, 63, 64 This recruitment of non-specific B cells increases the number of antigen-presenting B cells from a few antigen-specific ones to the entire B-cell population. However, only B cells bearing specific antigen receptors are eventually stimulated by T-helper (Th) cells for antibody production. 61 Thornton et al. also showed that iC3b-containing TG/NAb complexes were also taken up by neutrophils, via complement receptors CR1 and CR3 (CD11b/CD18), indicating that the formation of ICs with NAbs may also be similarly important for the uptake of self-antigens by myeloid cells (of relevance for dendritic cells). 60 Taken together, these findings suggest that antigen presentation is strongly promoted by incorporation of antigens into complement-activating ICs with NAbs. Correspondingly, the presentation of TG on B cells is proportional to the anti-TG NAb content of the surrounding serum, and is thus considerably higher in the presence of sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or Graves' disease (GD) with a high content of anti-TG, as compared with sera from healthy individuals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 386, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 943, "end": 946, "text": "58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 947, "end": 949, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1031, "text": "Thornton et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1292, "text": "60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1295, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1456, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1593, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1805, "end": 1808, "text": "60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1812, "text": "61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1816, "text": "63,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1817, "end": 1819, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2109, "end": 2111, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2112, "end": 2132, "text": "Thornton et al. also", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2430, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1277, "end": 1286, "text": "(Fig. 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1588, "text": "(Fig. 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1802, "text": "(Fig. 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "IMMUNOREGULATORY NAbs AGAINST NON-CYTOKINE SELF-ANTIGENS"}, {"text": "In analogous studies using myelin basic protein (MBP) as self-antigen, we found that sera from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and sera from healthy individuals contained approximately equal concentrations of MBP-reactive IgM. 65 Upon addition of MBP to normal mononuclear cells suspended in patient or control sera, MBP co-deposited with IgM, IgG and C3-fragments on monocytes. While the deposition of IgM and C3 was approximately similar in patient and control sera, the IgG deposition was increased 9-fold in the presence of MS sera, presumably due to the presence of circulating high-affinity IgG DAbs in the patients. Notably, the deposition of C3 fragments as well as that of IgM and MBP on monocytes was abrogated by disruption of the tertiary structure of MBP by boiling, as would be expected if complex formation depends upon the interaction of antibodies with conformational epitopes on MBP.
