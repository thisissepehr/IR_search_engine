Under China's nationwide quarantine and extremely strict epidemic prevention measures, it becomes increasingly critical for China and the world to know the evolving trend, though unclear yet, for the sake of the global economy. This is mainly due to the following two important reasons [2] . First of all, because of the quarantine, a sudden shutdown of manufacturing in China (now the second largest economy of the world) would break the global supply chain, with the potential to eliminate China's current advantageous position. Secondly, many small enterprises in the service industry are facing death or life situation with the spreading disease, and many will bankrupt [3] . When the inflection point of the COVID-19 epidemic appears suddenly becomes a critical issue for China and the world.",

From a geographical point of view, the spatial diffusion of infectious diseases is actually a comprehensive phenomenon in which the virus spreads in space and time [4] . There are many types of diffusions, which can generally be divided into two categories: expansion diffusion and migration diffusion [5, 6] . Expansion diffusion can be further divided into contagious diffusion and hierarchical diffusions; and migration diffusion can be classified into relocation diffusion and propagated diffusions [7] . Contagious diffusion, also known as infection diffusion, refers to the fact that the number of contacts is increasing and the space occupied by contacts is constantly expanding without changing the location of the source of infection. For infectious diseases, through the mutual contact of individuals, the virus or germ is transmitted from the carrier to other people or animals; that is, a progressive continuous spatiotemporal process of the virus or germ diffusion is in place [4] .",

The end result is the whole process either ''disappears\" or is ''out of control\" [1, 8] . Assuming a situation of single-sourced epidemic and steady intensity of infection, without human interventions, the diffusion of virus in time will follow the shape of the power function or the logistics function [9, 10] . However, since the growth of viral or bacterial cells requires protein nutrition, and cell regeneration takes time [4] , the spatiotemporal process of the infectious diseases evolves in several different stages. For more complicated spatiotemporal processes, quadratic, cubic or exponential functions can be used and adopted [11] .",
