            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cell damage, and loss of the alveolar-capillary barrier. We have previously shown that P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), a cell death receptor, is specifically expressed in alveolar epithelial type I cells (AEC I). In this study, we hypothesized that P2X7R-mediated purinergic signaling and its interaction with Wnt/b-catenin signaling contributes to AEC I death. We examined the effect of P2X7R agonist 2 0 -3 0 -O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) and Wnt agonist Wnt3a on AEC I death in vitro and in vivo. We also assessed the therapeutic potential of Wnt3a in a clinically relevant ALI model of intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure in ventilated mice. We found that the activation of P2X7R by BzATP caused the death of AEC I by suppressing Wnt/b-catenin signaling through stimulating glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b) and proteasome. On the other hand, the activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling by Wnt3a, GSK-3b inhibitor, or proteasome inhibitor blocked the P2X7R-mediated cell death. More importantly, Wnt3a attenuated the AEC I damage caused by intratracheal instillation of BzATP in rats or LPS in ventilated mice. Our results suggest that Wnt3a overrides the effect of P2X7R on the Wnt/b-catenin signaling to prevent the AEC I death and restrict the severity of ALI.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are life-threatening diseases caused by a variety of reasons, including sepsis, trauma, and pneumonia. 1 The alveolar epithelium consists of alveolar epithelial type I cells (AEC I) and alveolar epithelial type II cells (AEC II) and is believed to have an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI. AEC I cover most of the alveolar surface area and are the primary barrier of defense against the variety of insults. 2, 3 They are more sensitive to injury in comparison with other lung cells. Damage of AEC I is observed in all kinds of ALI, leading to the deficiency of gas exchange and disruption of fluid clearance. The molecular mechanisms of AEC I death during ALI have been studied to some extent including the regulation of several signaling pathways, such as TGF-b pathway, NFkB pathway, and Fas/FasL-mediated pathway. 4 Wnt is a family of secreted glycoprotein and has an important role in development, tissue regeneration, and cell fate determination. 5 In the absence of Wnt ligands, the intracellular b-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b) and degraded in proteasomes. The binding of Wnt ligands with frizzled receptors leads to the disruption of GSK-3b-mediated phosphorylation of b-catenin and thus attenuation of proteasome-mediated degradation. The stabilized b-catenin then translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription factors to increase the transcription of its downstream genes. We have previously shown that pleiotrophin and miR-375 regulate Wnt/b-catenin signaling during alveolar epithelial cell differentiation. 6, 7 Recent studies reveal essential roles of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in the pathogenesis of several lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, 8, 9 asthma, 10 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 11, 12 Activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling promotes AEC II survival, 13 whereas deletion of b-catenin in AEC results in an increased AEC death in bleomycin-induced lung injury model. 8 Transepithelial migration of neutrophils also activates Wnt/b-catenin signaling in AEC II and accelerates the epithelial repair. 14 Thus, it is important to explore the potential contribution of Wnt/b-catenin to AEC I damage during ALI.",

However, HEK293 (a human epithelial kidney cell line), R3/1 (a rat AEC I cell line), A549 (a human carcinoma AEC II cell line), Pre-TII (a rat fetal AEC II cell line), H441 (a human lung papillary adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line), RLE-6TN (a rat lung AEC II cell line), and RFL-6 (a fetal lung fibroblast cell line) had no P2X7R expression (Supplementary Figure  S1a in the online data supplement). The mRNA expression of mouse P2X subunits was further analyzed using PCR. P2X3R, P2X4R, P2X6R, and P2X7R subunits were highly expressed in E10 cells. The expression levels of P2X1R and P2X5R subunits were barely detectable, and P2X2R had no expression in E10 cells.

Treatment of E10 cells with 2 0 -3 0 -O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP), a potent P2X7R agonist, for 12 h significantly decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner as measured with MTT assay and counting cell numbers (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S2a ). Direct cell lysis was monitored by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. High doses (4200 mM) of BzATP dramatically increased LDH release from dead cells (Figure 1b) . To determine the specificity of BzATP, oxidized ATP (oATP, a P2X7R antagonist) was utilized to block P2X7R activity. Pre-incubation of E10 cells with 500 mM oATP totally attenuated the BzATP effect on cell viability ( Figure 1c ) and LDH release (Supplementary Figure  S2b) . We have previously shown that adenovirus-based shRNAs significantly reduce P2XR protein levels in E10 cells. 17 The knockdown of P2X7R under the same conditions also inhibited the BzATP-induced reduction in cell viability ( Figure 1d ) and increase in LDH release (Supplementary Figure S3a ). In addition, BzATP did not induce cell death in the lung cells, A549 and H441, that do not express P2X7R (Supplementary Figure S3c treated with BzATP for various times and were allowed to recover in a normal medium without BzATP for 8 h. The cells treated for up to 6 h were reversible. However, if the cells were treated for longer than 8 h, the cells cannot be recovered ( Figure 1e ).",

Wnt/b-catenin signaling is important for cell proliferation and survival. 5 We determined whether P2X7R-mediated cell death is due to downregulation of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling. Several components of Wnt/b-catenin signaling were analyzed after BzATP treatment. Western blot analysis demonstrated that activated b-catenin and, to a lesser extent, total b-catenin were downregulated by BzATP treatment (Figure 2a ). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), classic cell survival proteins were reduced as well (Figure 2a ). To further determine the effect of BzATP on b-catenin/TCF/LEF activity, dual-luciferase assay was used to determine the activities of TOPflash, a TCF/LEF reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase. BzATP significantly decreased TOPflash activity. However, BzATP had no effect on the activity of FOPflash, a plasmid containing a mutated TCF/LEF-binding site ( Figure 2b ). Furthermore, we examined the mRNA expression of several Wnt/b-catenin downstream genes: Bmp4, Axin2, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E1. Real-time PCR showed that the expression of all these four target genes was inhibited (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure S4 ). Our results indicate that Wnt/bcatenin signaling is suppressed by BzATP treatment.",

To evaluate the role of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in P2X7R-mediated cell death, we activated Wnt/b-catenin signaling with its natural ligand, Wnt3a, and examined its effect on P2X7R-mediated depression of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and cell death. Activation of P2X7R stimulates GSK-3b and proteasome activities. As Wnt3a is known to inhibit GSK-3b, resulting in the activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, 5 we examined whether the downregulation of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway by P2X7R is through the stimulation of GSK-3b. We monitored the phosphorylation of Y216, an activated form of GSK-3b, and the phosphorylation of S9, an inactivated form of GSK-3b. The activation of P2X7R by BzATP increased the phosphorylation of Y216 and decreased the phosphorylation of S9 in GSK-3b without affecting the total GSK-3b expression ( Figure 4a ). The result indicates that BzATP stimulates GSK-3b activity. As expected, LiCl, a selective inhibitor of GSK-3b, activated Wnt/b-catenin signaling as indicated by the translocation of b-catenin into the nucleus (Supplementary Figure S6 ) and reduced BzATP-mediated cell death (Figures 4b and c ).",

Histological examination of lung tissues showed evidence of diffused lung injury with significant alveolar septal necrosis and edema formation seen in BzATP-treated mice ( Figure 6A ). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell analysis indicated that activation of P2X7R led to a 3.2-fold increase in alveolar macrophages. However, no significant neutrophil infiltrations were observed ( Figure 6B ). BAL protein level was elevated by BzATP (Supplementary Figure S7) . LDH activity in BAL, representing necrotic cell death, was also increased by BzATP treatment ( Figure 6C ). An increase in T1a, an AEC I marker, was observed in BAL of the BzATP-treated group, indicating AEC I damage ( Figure 6D ). Instillation of Wnt3a_CM together with BzATP dramatically reduced the number of alveolar macrophages in BAL and BAL protein concentration in comparison with Con_CM ( Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S7 ). Wnt3a also significantly decreased LDH and T1a release caused by BzATP ( Figures 6C and D) . It was noted that both protein concentration and LDH activity in BAL were higher in Con_CM than in the PBS group. This is likely because of the existence of proteins and LDH in the conditioned medium (CM). These results indicated that Wnt3a can limit AEC I death induced by activation of P2X7R in rats.",

As bacterial infection and mechanical ventilation (MV) are two major causes of ALI/ARDS in clinical situations, we further took use of a two-hit mouse model of ALI, 22 which account for the influences of both factors: LPS as bacterial infection and noninjurious MV as clinical MV support. In comparison with the Con_CM group, Wnt3a_CM dramatically reduced the protein concentration in BAL fluid (Figure 7a ). LDH activity in BAL was also decreased 40% in the Wnt3a_CM-treated group (Figure 7b ). Most importantly, T1a in BAL was 70% less in Wnt3a_CM-treated group than the control group ( Figure 7c ). These results indicated that the activation of canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling can significantly reduce AEC I death during ALI.",

We found that the activation of P2X7R caused AEC I death at least partly by depressing the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway via GSK-3b and proteasome. The activation of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling or inhibition of GSK-3b or proteasome prevented P2X7R-mediated AEC I death. Furthermore, Wnt3a significantly reduced the AEC I damage caused by intratracheal instillation of BzATP in rats and LPS exposure in a ventilated mouse model. ATP-induced cell death has been observed in P2X7Rexpressing cells and can be blocked by P2X7R inhibitors. 18, 19 We have previously shown that P2X7R is highly expressed in AEC I in the lung. 16 This gives us an idea that P2X7R might mediate AEC I death. This is supported by our current data showing that the treatment of E10 with BzATP, a specific P2X7R agonist, decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, which was blocked by oATP, a P2X7R antagonist.",

As shown above, BzATP treatment caused a decrease in cell number of E10 cells. Wnt3a_CM, but not Wnt5a_CM or Con_CM, prevented the BzATP-induced decrease in cell number (Figure 3a).

Activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling by Wnt3a_CM in E10 cells also blocked P2X7-mediated decrease in cell viability and increase in LDH release(Figures 3b and c). Wnt3a_CM also protected primary AEC-I-like cells from BzATP-induced cell death(Figure 3d).
