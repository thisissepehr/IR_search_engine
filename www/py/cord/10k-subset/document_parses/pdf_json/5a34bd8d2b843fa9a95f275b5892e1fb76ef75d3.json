It had been more than 30 years in the making. Catalogues of available medicines and their composition have gradually evolved. The British National War Formulary, a \"selection of medicaments sufficient in range to meet ordinary requirements of therapeutics\" was in this mould, but the new-style British National Formulary (BNF), first published in 1981, contains in addition essential information on the indications, contraindications, cautions, dosage, and drug interactions of almost all licensed medicines used in general practice, and most drugs used in hospitals. The Medicines Act 1968 and its European successors demand that marketing authorizations (\"licences\") are only issued if medicines fulfil three criteria-quality of manufacture, efficacy in the licensed indication, and reasonable safety. These are not, however, sufficient to ensure safe, rational, and cost-effective therapeutic choices. There are several reasons for this. 2 | PROBLEMS 2.1 | Multiplicity of medicines There is a multiplicity of agents with similar or identical therapeutic properties. The current BNF lists 14 beta-blockers licensed for treatment of arterial hypertension: 10 angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors; eight angiotensin-2 antagonists, eight calcium antagonists, and five diuretics; and at least 25 preparations combining two or more anti-hypertensives. The mere existence of so many alternatives means that patient safety is compromised by the potential for confusion among and between drugs of the same class but with different properties or dosage. There are also financial consequences, because some drugs may be more costly than others and because the need to keep several very similar drugs in stock carries costs both in acquisition (and wastage) and in space for storage. Thus, choosing to limit the local availability of drugs with similar actions should make patients safer and should reduce costs. \u00a9 2019 The British Pharmacological Society Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2019;86:10-12.",

This explains in part, for example, the very large numbers of patients exposed to rofecoxib (Vioxx) in the 5 years from licensing to withdrawal. 2 ",

It is uncertain whether companies spend more on research than on marketing. 3 It is clear that substantial sums are spent on marketing: $17 700m on medical marketing in 1997, which rose to $20 900m in 2016. 4 Marketing is not always constrained by ethics or self-regulation: between 2003 and 2012, there were 74 cases of off-label promotion in the United Kingdom, and 43 companies were ruled in breach of the relevant regulation at least once. 5 It is also clear that prescribers are influenced by such marketing. A study in the United States found that \"Gifts from DOI: 10.1111/bcp.14088 wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/bcp pharmaceutical companies are associated with more prescriptions per patient, more costly prescriptions, and a higher proportion of branded prescriptions with variation across specialties.
