Indeed, there are mainly two populations involved in the transmission of the WNV: the population of mosquitoes (Culex sp.) and the population of birds. In this paper, we mainly consider the Corvidae family and more specifically crows which have been chosen by public health authorities as indicator birds for the WNV. Mosquitoes spawn eggs in sumps and other shelters. The larvae hatch from eggs and evolve into nymphs that emerge to become adult mosquitoes. This cycle mainly depends on temperature and humidity [9] . Besides, human intervention can reduce the population of mosquitoes through larvicide treatments (e.g. Methoprene) in order to kill larvae. The transmission of the WNV occurs mainly mosquitoes biting birds. An infected mosquito can infect a bird, which can in turn infect healthy mosquitoes that will subsequently bite the infected bird before its death [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 139, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 655, "end": 658, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1019, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 9, "end": 17, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Regarding the populations of Corvidae, their spatial and temporal characteristics depend on geographic areas and on the periodicity of displacements and grouping. During early spring bird couples spread over the whole territory and remain for few months around their nesting areas. By the end of July, which happens to be the very beginning of human infections in Quebec [3] , Corvidae change their social behaviour and regroup in roosts at night. During the day, the birds fly to surrounding areas in search of food, but they go back to the roosts at night [11] . At the end of fall, many of them migrate to warmer areas south of the province [12] . Furthermore, the transmission of WNV to the populations of Corvidae can occur either by mechanical infection (an infection after a direct contact between birds) or through the biting of a healthy Corvidae by an infected mosquito ( Figure 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 371, "end": 374, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 558, "end": 562, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 882, "end": 890, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "Since we wanted to simulate the progression of the WNV infection involving a large number of individuals of two main species interacting in a particular geographic region, we selected a geosimulation approach which allows for the study of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the populations' interactions in a virtual geographical environment [6] . However, given the enormous complexity involved in representing such phenomena and the lack of detailed data, we had to raise a number of reasonable simplifying hypotheses with regard to the species of mosquitoes and Corvidae of interest, to the factors influencing the evolution of these populations, the geographical region selected for the analysis, the period of simulation and the space-time scale. These hypotheses led us to identify a set of key parameters to carry out the simulations, based on the epidemiologic and surveillance experience with WNV in North America and more precisely in the province of Quebec [4] . For example, considering the availability of surveillance data, we selected the American crow as the main indicator bird species; and the Culex pipiens and Culex restuans as the main mosquito's species susceptible to bite crows (and possibly humans). Another example is the period of simulation for the WNV propagation: July 1st to October 1st was selected as the critical time window during which human cases have appeared in Quebec so far (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 351, "end": 354, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 977, "end": 980, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1424, "end": 1433, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "The objective of the conceptual model is to introduce a synthetic view of the phenomena of interest while taking into account the above mentioned simplifying hypotheses ( Figure 2 ). Let us briefly comment upon this model which represents the evolution and interactions of Culex sp. (pipiens/restuans) and crows. Moreover, we simplified the biological cycle of Culex to only consider the change from a larval state to an adult one. From a public health management's point of view, these two states are the most important ones since the virus is spread by adult females and treatments against the progression of the WNV are carried out using larvicides. This simplification has been validated by domain experts (see below). In addition, considering the spatial dynamics of crow populations, we selected the period of the year when Corvidae regroup in roosts. In our model, a roost is considered as the spatial extension of an aggregate of crows (a sub-population of crows which gathers in this roost for the period of the year of interest). During the day, crows fly a variable distance from the roost in search of food, and return at night. Hence, the spatial phenomenon of gathering and dispersion of this sub-population of crows can be represented in a synthetic way in the form of an expansion and a contraction of the area occupied by this sub-population. The surface over which the birds spread during the day (\"roost expansion\") depends on the roost size. Consequently, we can take into account the variable density of crows in this dynamically changing area. Another fact to consider is that the Culex mosquito has a mostly nocturnal activity [13] . Therefore, the crows located in roosts at night will be good targets for them. Moreover, preset variables have been used in order to compute parameters such as the infection probabilities and the mortality proportions.

Hence, we tuned up the initial settings of the simulation (e.g. the initial percentage of infected Culex or infected crows, distance between sumps, emerged Culex per sump, percentage of sumps containing larvae, etc) as well as some parameters of the mathematical model (e.g. mosquitoes biting rate of crows per capita, WNV transmission probabilities from Culex to crows of from crows to Culex, etc).

Moreover, we used a multi-agent geosimulation approach which takes into account the influence of the geographic characteristics of the various regions, thanks to the use of GIS data. For example, we determined the geo-referenced co-ordinates of crows' roosts in order to locate them on the map and we were able to develop rules which control the expansion/contraction of roosts over space and time. We also pre-processed climate data in a GIS in order to feed it to the simulation. We also used the geographic characteristics and the location of favourable habitats for mosquitoes in order to represent the populations of Culex using an intelligent density map. Consequently, we were able to implement the interactions between the mosquitoes' and birds' populations which can cause an outbreak of the virus and epidemic propagation of the disease. Even if other works [26, 27] also used GIS data to simulate the spread of the WNV, they did not offer a decision support system as we do. In contrast, our system enables users to simulate the propagation of WNV under various short-term climate scenarios and allows for local parameterization. This approach may be useful for practical decision-making. For instance, it has been shown [28] that the number of degree-days below -5\u00b0C in the winter and the number of degree-days greater than 25\u00b0C in the summer may contribute to a highly epidemic emergence of the virus during the summer under specific climatic conditions. Consequently, our system may be used to predict such an epidemic if we simulate the propagation of the WNV using a scenario in which seasonal forecasts of climatic data are favourable for the emergence of the virus [29] .

Climate effects are computed using another set of equations that is not presented in this paper. These equations modify certain parameters in the differential equations of Figure 12b .
