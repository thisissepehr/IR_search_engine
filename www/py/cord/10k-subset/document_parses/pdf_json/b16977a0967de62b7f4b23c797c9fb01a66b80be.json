The commonest indication for PICU admission was persistent shock (39 patients) followed by requirement for positive pressure ventilation in 29 patients (10 of whom had Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]) and neurological symptoms in 24 patients. An important finding was the presence of diastolic dysfunction in 3 children. Six deaths of refractory shock included 4 who had ARDS and DIC and 2 who had shock with DIC 3 patients had abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) has not been previously described in children with DSS and may lead to fluid refractory shock if not corrected. All patients had thrombocytopenia which was a defining feature of the syndrome, while 74 were also coagulopathic and 6 had severe fatal DIC. Hepatic dysfunction was more severe in children with prolonged shock, however, only a fifth of cases (5/24) with neurological manifestations were in shock. Other significant reasons for neurological presentation included cerebral edema, and encephalopathy secondary to hepatic dysfunction. 2 children had features of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), previously only described in adults with dengue.",

It was found that complications such as DIC, diastolic dysfunction, abdominal compartment syndrome, ARDS and hepatic dysfunction were more frequent in severe established shock.

Failure of the systemic perfusion to improve despite fluid and blood transfusion led to echocardiographic evaluation of the myocardial function: an unexpected finding was the presence of diastolic dysfunction 18 in 3 cases. This feature, although likely due to myocardial edema in the setting of gross anasarca has been previously reported by us in dengue /~4} and has important implications for fluid resuscitation. Children with diastolic dysfunction are at a higher risk of elevated left ventricular filling pressures and resultant pulmonary edema with fluid challenges, is The finding may be missed unless Doppler studies are performed by an experienced echocardiographer and management includes small volume fluid resuscitation at slower rates, avoidance of tachycardia and use of non-catecholamine lusitropic agents such as the phospho-diesterase inhibitor agent milrinone. Echocardiographic features of left ventricular dysfunction was obtained in only two patients. This was probably a gross under-estimation as all patients with fluid and blood product refractory shock were already on inotropes at the time of echocardiography, which may have \"normalized\" abnormal left ventricular systolic function.",
