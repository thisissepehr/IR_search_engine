This study has used group interviews to explore how different temporal aspects of CM can be considered in CM design and how they can influence crisis managers SA. A prototype and a scenario were used as mediating materials. The result consists of two parts. The first part is comprised of the participants' reflections on how timelines can be used to display information in CM information systems. According to the participants, timelines should present: deadlines, information sent to the public, incoming and outgoing information, an overview of where the current activities belong in the CM process and what has been going on since the last shift during shift changes. Timelines should not only display the listed information, but also provide functionality for adjusting the timescale so that information can be presented in alternative temporal perspectives. The second part of the result contains several obstacles that might influence the crisis managers' ability to obtain SA. Obstacles elicited from the group discussions are: information overflow, fast changes of SA due to incoming information, difficulties to share SA with actors outside the CM centre, forgetting things that need attention and that SA depends on the quality of incoming information. The two parts of the result have been compiled into six design principles for how temporality can be considered in CM systems in order to support SA.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "There are many challenges in the design of information technology for crisis management (CM), including how to create an interface that provides an efficient overview of the crisis situation and other information needed by the crisis managers. In this work, we focus on information technology used by local and regional government when coordinating response activities during a crisis, that is, during an extraordinary event as defined in Swedish crisis preparedness law (Justitiedepartementet 2006) . Among the difficulties in presenting an overview of a crisis is the fact that crises are dynamic events that change over time. Response activities with different time frames can go on concurrently, and the continuous information flow into the CM centre can be difficult to take in, as observed by Militello in his study of county level CM exercises (Militello et al. 2007 ). Because of this, we have chosen to investigate time and temporality with the help of group interviews to explore how time and temporality can be presented in information systems for CM. Additional reasons for focusing on this specific topic are: that human cognition has difficulties in processing temporal relationships (D\u00f6rner 1997) and consequently might benefit from support in this area, and because time is an important dimension of situation awareness (SA) (Endsley et al. 2003, Sect. 2.2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 471, "end": 499, "text": "(Justitiedepartementet 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 851, "end": 873, "text": "(Militello et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1211, "text": "(D\u00f6rner 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1373, "text": "(Endsley et al. 2003, Sect. 2.2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Two important sets of design principles exist today that address different aspects of the design of information technology for CM: the general design principles for emergency response systems defined in (Turoff et al. 2004b ) and the design principles for situation awareness in (Endsley et al. 2003) .

Continium is a timeline visualisation tool proposed by Andr\u00e9. It can be used to represent large amounts of hierarchically structured temporal data and has features that help keeping the presentation clear when zooming in or out. The user can also select which dimensions should be shown. Li, on the other hand, has combined time-wheel presentation and timeline presentation to create timewaves. The time-waves are mainly intended for exploring spatio-temporal data and can be connected to location space and attribute space to offer more query possibilities. Finally, we have Chronos by Luz, which is a temporal mosaic with similarities to gant-diagrams and is used for project planning. In the temporal mosaic, space is allocated proportionally to the number of allocated tasks. Based on the descriptions in the above works, several observations can be made concerning the usefulness of the visualisations for a CM context. Continium appears to be able to handle large amounts of data, but requires the information to have clear hierarchies, while information related to crises can be unstructured. Continium is also not directly designed for handling dynamic real-time information, as might be needed during a crisis, but instead is more focused on visualising historical data. Time-waves can visualise certain aspects of a crisis, such as in Li's example of a time-wave for earthquakes, but is limited (in the same way as regular timelines are) when it comes to visualising large amounts of data that are close in time.

The model is based on ''temporal coordination'' (Bardram 2009 ), which is a concept based on activity theory within the computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) field. The issue that Franke is addressing is not only a technical one, but arises in any information sharing between actors in CM. Conflicts can arise when different actors have a different understanding of the duration of activities or how events are casually related to each other. Franke uses collaboration between the fire brigade, the police and the military during a flood as an example (Franke et al. 2011) . Temporal relations become important in this case, because the fire fighters depend on the military to bring sand bags in order to be able to build a dam protecting the residential area. The police's activities depend on the other actors' activities because they might have to evacuate the residential area.

One definition of SA is given by Endsley: ''The perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the future.'' (Endsley et al. 2003 ) Based on this definition, SA is divided into three levels: (1) perception of elements in the environment that are important for current goals and tasks, (2) comprehension of their meaning for the goals and tasks and (3) projection of what will happen to the elements in the future and how the situation will develop. SA is not only an individual's understanding of a situation, but can also be shared or distributed among different team members or organisations (Gutwin and Greenberg 2004; Salmon et al. 2009; Stanton et al. 2006; Endsley et al. 2003, chapter 11, pp 193-219) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 358, "text": "(Endsley et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 823, "end": 850, "text": "(Gutwin and Greenberg 2004;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 851, "end": 870, "text": "Salmon et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 871, "end": 891, "text": "Stanton et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 892, "end": 936, "text": "Endsley et al. 2003, chapter 11, pp 193-219)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Situation Awareness"}, {"text": "Time is according to Endsley an important part of SA (Endsley et al. 2003, Sect. 2.2) . She states that operators in many domains are interested not only in spatial aspects of the world, but also want to know when an observed element might influence their tasks or goals. Since crisis situations are dynamic and changing, the individual's SA also has to constantly change to stay up-to-date. An example of the difficulties with staying up-to-date is that it might not be known beforehand which information sources will be available during a crisis event. In some cases, there might be completely new information systems or information sources emerging. Two examples of emerging information sources are: when a new information system was developed to support the large-scale contact tracing and data management during the SARS outbreak in Singapore 2003, and when the Singapore Regional Coordination Center (SRCC) developed a web-based Crisis Case Management System (CCMS) for monitoring the availability and demand of aid supplies and assessing how these supplies could be distributed during the Asian tsunami disaster in 2004 (Leidner et al. 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 85, "text": "(Endsley et al. 2003, Sect. 2.2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1147, "text": "(Leidner et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Situation Awareness"}, {"text": "However, it is not uncomplicated to measure and analyse aspects related to SA in a complex CM context by traditional SA design and evaluation methods (Harrald and Jefferson 2007; Salmon et al. 2006) .

The main idea from Harrald and Jefferson's discussion about designing for CM is that it is insufficient, and might even be impossible, to gather information requirements in the same way as done in less complex operator environments. Salmon, on the other hand, has evaluated different SA measurement techniques' suitability for a command, control, communication, computers and intelligence (C4i) context (Salmon et al. 2006 ). Salmon's evaluation is relevant for CM since C4i includes emergency services such as police and fire brigade. His conclusion is that none of the 17 tested SA measurement techniques would be sufficient for a C4i context and also suggests that further research needs to be done in order to investigate whether it is possible to combine several of the existing techniques into a measurement tool that can give a more complete assessment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 178, "text": "(Harrald and Jefferson 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 179, "end": 198, "text": "Salmon et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1025, "text": "(Salmon et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Situation Awareness"}, {"text": "The conclusion from the previous section is that temporality in the design of CM systems needs to be further explored.

This leads to triangulation, since the set-up allows us to identify potentially conflicting statements between the groups, and more confidence can be put into that the result can be applicable to CM at local and regional level overall. Advantages of group interviews are that they may reveal dynamics through interaction and issues not apparent in individual interaction (Gillham 2005) . Additionally, according to Gillham, they can provide an early indication of a range of views. The choice of group interviews instead of individual interviews allowed us to talk to people with different CM roles at the same time.

Further, the participants needed to have at least some experience from participating in municipal/county CM or have training for such work. This in order to be users, or potential users, of the kind of CM information systems we are seeking to improve. The contact person's suggestion for participants was discussed with us and approved before a final time for the group session Both county councils and municipalities were included in the study, which means that the study covers local and regional perspectives, but not national ones. There are differences between authorities and caution should be taken to generalise result to most Swedish authorities. As participant C in the county council group pointed out during the discussions, the county council has slightly different working conditions since it operates in a big city area, where the rescue service has a large emergency management centre that is capable of managing parts of the coordination work that otherwise would have fallen on the county council. By operating in a coast area, the county council can also collaborate with the coast guard or sear rescue service, which might not be the case in other counties. Nevertheless, the regulations and CM system are the same for all local and regional authorities in Sweden. This means that the conditions for CM work in general are comparable between the authorities participating in the study and other municipalities and county councils. Furthermore, all participants in the study were active in various collaboration networks, training and exercises, with actors outside their own specific authority or area. The systems and tools that are used to support CM work might vary from organisation to organisation, but two commonly used systems by municipalities and county councils are Web-based Information System (WIS) (MSB 2009) and Samverkanswebben (SOS Alarm Sverige AB, 2010). WIS is used for sharing information-for example, operational pictures-between local, regional and national authorities and other organisations that take part in CM work. Samverkanswebben collects information from SOS Alarm and numerous other sources to provide regional and local crisis managers with a map-based overview of accidents, fires, police activities, the traffic situation, disturbances in the electricity supply, weather alerts and other emergency-or crisis-related information.

This arrangement of information can support global SA because the crisis manager can get an overview of a project by looking just in one place, and it organises information around goals by collecting information based on event or project Timelines and checklists help to provide a global overview in accordance with SA principle no. 4. Timelines can give the crisis manager an overview of events and actions so that the crisis manager does not lose the overall perspective of what has been going on during the crisis even if he at the moment is working on a specific task. The timeline is interactive, so that the user can select an item for more details, for example, to see the meeting notes connected to a CM meeting.

The scenario was based on a case in Lilla Edet in 2008 (Gryszkiewicz and Chen 2010) in order to use a realistic event as the basis for the scenario. It has been estimated (based on questionnaires sent out after the outbreak) that the outbreak of Calici virus in Lilla Edet caused 2400 sick cases, affecting one-fifth of the population in the municipality (Ekvall 2010) . The groups were given a scenario where a waterborne infection had affected their municipality or county and lead to several hundred sick cases. The source of infection was not known at the beginning of the event, but all signs would be indicating that the infection was waterborne. The specific sequence of events or response activities was not specified beforehand, because the objective was to allow the participants to describe how an outbreak of waterborne infection would be handled by their specific authority. This includes which response actions would be taken by the CM group and what other actors (both organisations and individuals) the participants would be exchanging information with. The scenario was chosen because providing a drinking water supply is a central societal function and especially important for municipal CM, since municipalities are responsible for monitoring the quality of the water (National Food Administration 2010). To sum up, the participants have not been directly involved in a real event as in the scenario, but are likely to be familiar with routines for how their organisation would respond, since possible risks to the drinking water supply is a common concern from a local or regional CM perspective. Municipalities and county councils do, however, have slightly different perspectives on water borne infections. Municipalities are more directly involved in the response work, while county councils have a more high-level role. County councils can, for example, help with expertise or coordinating contacts to national authorities and organisations such as the Swedish National Food Administration or the National Water Catastrophe Group (which is a support group of experts who can provide advice on crises that affect the water supply).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 460, "end": 473, "text": "(Ekvall 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Scenario"}, {"text": "Each group session was 2 h long and was voice recorded.

Obstacles 1 and 4 Table 4 are both connected to that SA problems arise when several people are involved in the information sharing connected to the crisis and especially when information needs to be shared between geographically distributed actors. The problem is not only the geographic distance itself-since information can easily be transferred by making a phone call or using some other available communication tool-but that different activities are going on asynchronously in the different locations. In participant A group 2's quote in the result section, the rescue service needs to adjust their activities because the electricity company is reporting that there is no power supply in an area. It could just as well be a municipality waiting for a laboratory to evaluate test results after an outbreak of waterborne infection or county council crisis managers coordinating their activities with other actors in the region in preparation for an approaching snow storm. Both events and CM activities have different dependencies based on time, and understanding the (D\u00f6rner 1997) people have more difficulties comprehending temporal relations compared to spatial. In the timeline discussion, participant B in group 3 pointed out the need to be able to go back and check past information, and this also indicates the wider problem of understanding dynamic situations. Being aware of the temporal relations between events and activities could additionally help the crisis manager to understand what tasks or information they need to pay attention to at a given moment (obstacle number 3, Table 4 ). Information overflow (obstacle number 2, Table 4 ) is another problem related to that multiple CM activities are going on concurrently. A crisis manager might be able to monitor one activity closely, but is not able to monitor a large amount of activities at the same time. Because of this, the crisis manager relies on reports and summaries from liaison officers as mentioned in the result section. The SA problem that arises is that it becomes very difficult for the crisis manager to obtain a completely up-to-date picture of the events. The picture of the current situation, which is presented in meetings or by CM systems, will always be more or less delayed since the reporting itself takes time. A further consequence of this is that the crisis managers SA might quickly change as new information comes in, obstacle number 5 Table 4 . New information could here mean a weather prognosis predicting a storm that was not observed in the previous prognosis or when a county council adjusts the CM activities based on new reports from the municipalities in the region. Data overload 1 is a common problem for SA, as pointed out by Endsley, who also makes the noteworthy comment that we sometimes miss that data overload in reality often is a function of the way that data are processed, stored and presented in many systems (Endsley et al. 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1201, "end": 1214, "text": "(D\u00f6rner 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3059, "end": 3080, "text": "(Endsley et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 156, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1721, "end": 1728, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1780, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 2564, "end": 2571, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "When (re-)designing CM systems, it is important to take into account that crisis events change over time.

The objective of the principles is to be useful when evaluating the interfaces of existing CM systems, but also in other design activities concerning CM systems where it might be beneficial to reflect on temporal aspects of the design. The principles have been created by an analysis of the result of the group interviews from a temporal perspective. This means that the principles primarily, but not exclusively, address design of CM systems used by municipal and county crisis managers when monitoring, for example, crisis response, planning or evaluation activities.

Each actor has a distinct role, with distinct goals and priorities for their activities. Since the different actors, nevertheless, have the common goal to respond to and mitigate the effects of a crisis, they all need information about temporal aspects of the event and of each other's work. CM systems can help the crisis managers to understand the situation by presenting temporal relationships between events and activities. Temporal relationships can be, for example, simultaneity, succession, recurrence, frequency, length, time shifts, as suggested in (Corn\u00e9lis 2005) . However, Franke observes that it is difficult to define dependencies between different actors' activities beforehand. As discussed in the previous section, presenting up-to-date information is difficult when a situation is constantly changing. A system can guide and support its users by showing create/last modification time of a data set. Such time-stamps can label weather prognosis creation, last test result update or progress report creation. The importance of time-stamps and other labels making information traceable back to its source was discussed by Turoff in his general design principle number 2 for emergency systems (Turoff et al. 2004b ). Turoff's design principle 2 points to any marking that makes information traceable to the source, and the specific point we want to add is that create/last update time-stamps especially can help the crisis manager to understand what the situation looks like right now.

Endsley also mentions displays that ''allow operators to anticipate possible occurrences'' to be helpful for the operators ability to create accurate projections. Projecting future events is a part of level 3 SA. For the design of CM systems, visualising temporal parameters could mean illustrating how a flood would spread as a function of rainfall or presenting how many and what kind of phone calls the switchboard is getting concerning a crisis over time. Furthermore, by presenting worst-case scenarios, showing alternative outcomes, or visualising constraints for how an event can develop, the crisis managers can start discussing and preparing response activities.

From a research perspective, it contributes with a better understanding of how temporality can affect SA in a CM context. It is a challenging task to assess and design for SA in a complex environment such as CM, and we have therefore used group interviews to gain insights on possible obstacles that might hinder crisis managers from obtaining SA. We have specifically addressed how different aspects of CM work might influence both the CM group's and the individual's SA. Obstacles elicited from the interviews are: information overflow, fast changes of SA due to incoming information, difficulties to share SA with actors outside the CM centre, forgetting things that need attention and that SA depends on the quality of incoming information. This work also contributes to practice, through the collected end-user input on the usefulness of timelines as a visualisation tool for crisis-related information. According to the participants, timelines should present: deadlines, information sent to the public, incoming and outgoing information, an overview of where the current activities belong in the CM process and what has been going on since the last shift during shift changes. Timelines should not only display the listed information, but also provide functionality for adjusting the timescale so that information can be presented in different temporal perspectives. The main contribution of this paper is the design principles that are based on all the findings mentioned above. The suggested design principles need further validation since the empirical material depends on the interviewees' descriptions of CM work. We intend to do this by comparing the findings to the designs of two CM information systems that are in use in Sweden. The evaluation will be done through interviews with crisis managers, since this allows us to study information from real crisis events and to take advantage of the users' knowledge about how and why the system has been used.
