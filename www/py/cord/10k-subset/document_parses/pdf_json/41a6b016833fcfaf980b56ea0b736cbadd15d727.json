In our survey the percentage of pregnancy at term was comparable (72%). The most frequent complications reported include hypertension and maternal infections, pre-term delivery and low-birth weight of the newborn infant [23, 24, 39, 40] . Our survey agrees with these data showing that pre-maturity is common (51% of pregnancies) and much more frequent than in the general population, in which the overall prematurity incidence is approximately 11% according to estimates [28, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44] .

In our study 41.8% of the babies we reviewed were born pre-term, of which 25% were classified as LBW, 14.3% as VLBW and 7.1% EVLBW [45, 46] . According to the official guidelines, women who have undergone transplant surgery must be tested for stable graft function and must be maintained on immunosuppression before planning to have a baby in order to minimize risks [5, 25] . Most pregnancies in patients with normal and stable organ function had no effect on the graft function or survival; in contrast, a deterioration in graft function represents a significant risk of graft loss within 2 years of delivery [25, 28, 47] . In some reports acute rejection during, or within 3 months after, pregnancy ranges between 9% and 14.5%. In our series, rejection occurred in two kidney transplant recipients, one of which was definitive (2.1%). This was reported by previous studies showing that the incidence of clinically diagnosed rejection of renal allografts during pregnancy was unchanged and not higher than expected for nonpregnant allograft recipients [26, 38, 48] .

This is partly because of the need to plan the baby's birth, partly due to the occurrence of maternal (i.e. hypertension and bilateral necrosis of the femur head) or foetal (IUGR) complications. It should not be overlooked, however, that after kidney transplantation natural childbirth may be unadvisable because of the location of the transplanted organ.
