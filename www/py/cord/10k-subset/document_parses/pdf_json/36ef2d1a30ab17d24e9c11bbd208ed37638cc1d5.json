Assessment of the baseline antibody repertoires of unimmunized model animals will be useful as a benchmark for future immunization experiments. We characterized the heavy chain and kappa light chain antibody repertoires of a model animal, the OmniRat, by high throughput antibody sequencing and made use of two novel datasets for comparison to human repertoires. Intra-animal and inter-animal repertoire comparisons reveal a high level of conservation in antibody diversity between the lymph node and spleen and between members of the species. Multiple differences were found in both the heavy and kappa chain repertoires between OmniRats and humans including gene segment usage, CDR3 length distributions, class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation levels and in features of V(D)J recombination. The Inference and Generation of Repertoires (IGoR) software tool was used to model recombination in VH regions which allowed for the quantification of some of these differences. Diversity estimates of the OmniRat heavy chain repertoires almost reached that of humans, around two orders of magnitude less. Despite variation between the species repertoires, a high frequency of OmniRat clonotypes were also found in the human repertoire. These data give insights into the development and selection of humanized animal antibodies and provide actionable information for use in vaccine studies.",

            "text": "A major challenge in human vaccine science is finding appropriate models for studying antibody responses. Animals such as mice, rabbits and monkeys have typically been used in the past and the small animals, in particular, have been favored for ease of immunization, cost reasons and the ability to extensively biopsy post-immunization. One limitation is their use of non-human immunoglobulin (V, D, J) genes in antibodies which can be restricted in their specificity 1 , and/or lack residues needed for priming by a germline targeting immunogen 2 . One approach to solving this problem of wild-type animal models is to use humanized immunoglobulin loci-transgenic rodents 3,4 . The first demonstration of a transgenic rodent with the ability to express human IgM was 30 years ago 5 . Since then, advances in genetic engineering technologies allowed for the first transgenic mice strains that express fully human antibodies 6,7 . Today, many new transgenic animal models have been developed including rodents, chickens, rabbits and cows 8 . These animal models have been used extensively for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 9 , tolerance studies 10 and more recently for modelling human antibody responses to vaccine candidates 3,4 . Here we focus on one such animal model: a rat with expression of humanized chimeric antibodies.",

Three unlinked loci contain the immunoglobulin gene segments necessary for the assembly of an antibody: one heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 and two light chain loci (lambda and kappa found on chromosomes 2 and 22 respectively). Large pre-B cells derived from common lymphoid progenitors randomly join VH, DH, and JH gene segments to produce a heavy chain. This process requires V(D)J recombinase: a protein complex that contains Processing of next-generation sequencing data. The Abstar analysis pipeline 17 was used as previously described to quality trim, remove adapters and merge paired sequences. Sequences were then annotated with Abstar in combination with UMI based error correction by AbCorrect (https://github.com/briney/abtools/). Resulting annotated consensus sequences were deposited to MongoDB and Spark databases for querying and data analysis in python on Jupyter and Zeppelin Notebooks. For comparisons of frequencies, read counts were scaled for each repertoire as previously described 33 due to the large differences in the number of reads between species and number of genes that each species expresses.",

After successful pairing of this newly formed heavy chain with surrogate light chain (SLC), recombination of a light chain from V and J gene segments of the kappa or lambda loci occurs and the B cell swaps the SLC for this new light chain. Unless the immature B cell is autoreactive or anergic and undergoes receptor editing or clonal deletion, it matures into a na\u00efve B cell and migrates to the periphery whereupon it can become activated by encountering antigen and form germinal centers with help from T-cells. Sequence diversity is again enhanced in the germinal center by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and/or class switch recombination (CSR), two processes that depend on activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The OmniRat was created by genomic integration of human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci on a background of inactivated endogenous rat Ig loci. It expresses chimeric heavy chains (i.e. human V, D, and J genes and rat constant genes) that pair with fully human light chains 11, 12 . We sought to characterize the circulating antibody repertoire diversity in this animal and make comparisons to humans.",

Reverse transcription of antibody RNA and combined tagging with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) have allowed us 14 and others 15, 16 to correct for error and bias in antibody sequencing. Using these methods to gain insight into the antibody repertoire of OmniRats, we ask whether or not it accurately represents that of humans, and by extension allows for usefulness in the approximation of the human antibody response. We postulate that there are major differences in the repertoires due to distinctness in the Ig loci genomic structure and genes that shape antibody diversity between species. Here, we provide the most thorough description of humanized transgenic rodent antibody repertoires to date and leverage a novel extremely deep human dataset to make comparisons with implications of immediate use as a reference for OmniRat immunization studies.",

We estimated diversity using Chao 2 22, 23 and Recon 23,24 as previously described 13 . Diversity estimates were similar between the two estimators, (4.8 \u00d7 10 6 -7.4 \u00d7 10 6 ) for Chao and (9.4 \u00d7 10 6 -1.9 \u00d7 10 7 ) for Recon (Fig. 3b) .

Our results show that there exists substantial variation in gene usage frequencies and elements of recombination, indicating specific limitations of this animal model for predicting the human immune response. We found that by performing hierarchical clustering on gene segment usage, repertoires clustered together by both species and tissue. Differences in gene segment usage between transgenic animal models and humans, as well as between tissues are expected. For example, multiple human Ig loci transgenic rodents are reported to have gene usage profiles that slightly vary from that of humans 25, 26 . Furthermore, antibody repertoires from separate human tissues are known to deviate strongly enough to be clustered by hierarchical clustering 27 . In our case, the lymph node repertoire from the OmniRat was most likely able to be distinguished from that of the spleen due to the increased presence of antigen-experienced B cells in the latter as shown by somatic hypermutation and class-switched transcript frequencies. This indicates that tissue selection will affect the outcome of an antibody discovery campaign and reinforces evidence for normal B cell development by suggesting the existence of affinity maturation.",

Interestingly, the mechanisms of this preference are due to decreased N additions, and a tendency to incorporate shorter DH gene segments. This result has also been seen in multiple other transgenic and wild-type rodents 25, 26, 28, 29 . The specific reasons remain unclear, although the observation that wild-type rat germline D gene segment lengths are shorter suggests intrinsic species-specific mechanisms of selection as well as differences in TdT expression during bone marrow B cell development. We further speculate that another possible reason for intra-species variation can be attributed to distinct prior antigen exposure and divergent gut microbiomes 30, 31 .",

We have also shown that this animal's antibodies show signs of class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation and large diversity supporting its value for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies to targets that may not be immunogenic in other models. Even though a high degree of variation exists, we still found many clonotypes to be shared between the species pools. Finally, more studies will need to be done in order to characterize OmniRat serum and memory B cell responses to immunogens.",
