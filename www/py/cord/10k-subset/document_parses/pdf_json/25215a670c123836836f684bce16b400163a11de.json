Such observations are based on adult data suggesting that individuals with asthma may present with cough alone 19 , while in hospitalbased studies, cough has been reported to be the commonest presenting Childhood respiratory diseases feature of asthma in children 20 . There are a number of difficulties inherent in using the symptom of cough as an outcome measure in epidemiological studies of respiratory illness in children. The repeatability of reporting of cough is poor, and several studies demonstrate that parental reports of cough frequency in their child, particularly nocturnal cough, are inaccurate when compared to objective measures 12 .

Airways resistance measured by the interrupter technique in preschool children did not differ significantly between coughers and control subjects 27 (Fig. 1) , while Brooke and colleagues demonstrated that 56% of children identified as having recurrent cough in the pre-school period were symptom-free at follow-up after 2-4 years with 37% reporting continued cough. Importantly, while 7% of children with recurrent cough reported wheeze at follow-up, a similar proportion to a previously symptom-free control group also reported symptoms suggesting asthma 28 . Therefore, previous clinical studies of children with persistent cough which have suggested that a significant number progress to develop asthma, who have not included an asymptomatic group, may have incorrectly assumed that such children represent cough-variant asthma 29 . While children with persistent or recurrent cough are more likely to use asthma medications as a result of an increased doctor diagnosis of asthma 23, 28 , previous studies that have promoted asthma medication for cough did not use placebo or include objective measures of cough 20,31 . Chang and colleagues have shown that inhaled salbutamol or beclomethasone in moderate dose is not superior to placebo in reducing subjective or objective measures of cough in the absence of airway obstruction 32 .

Antibiotics appear to play only a small role in resolving symptoms of AOM and their use is associated with increasing resistance in Strep. pneumoniae and H. influenzae 61 . A recent Cochrane Review, which included 2202 children, showed only limited benefit of antibiotics in AOM with 17 children needing to be treated to prevent one child experiencing some pain after 2 days 62 . There was no effect of antibiotics on complications or recurrence of AOM 62 . Antibiotic use in acute OM appeared to confer no significant improvement in the prevalence of hearing deficit or on recurrence rates of acute OM in a recent meta-analysis, but may have been insufficiently powered to demonstrate clinically significant outcomes [62] [63] [64] . The majority of cases of acute OM resolve spontaneously; however, where antibiotics are prescribed in populations thought to be at increased risk of complications, amoxycillin remains the drug of choice 65 . Uncomplicated AOM may be treated with a shortened 5-7 day antibiotic course, a practice supported by a number of randomised controlled trials 66 , although short-course therapy may not be appropriate for young children less than 2 years who are at higher risk of treatment failure 67 . It has been suggested that children under 2 years of age, who are at particular risk of poor outcome from AOM, may be a group who would benefit from aggressive antibiotic treatment. However, current high prescription rates of antibiotics to treat AOM in this age group are not supported by a recent study by Damoiseaux et al, who demonstrated that, while after 4 days of treatment, antibiotics led to resolution of more symptoms, there were no differences between treatment and placebo groups at 11 days and prevalence of middle ear effusion at 6 weeks 68,69 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 174, "text": "60", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 345, "end": 347, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 630, "end": 632, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 895, "end": 899, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 900, "end": 904, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 905, "end": 909, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1117, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1264, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1403, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Antibiotic treatment in acute otitis media"}, {"text": "Recurrent OM is defined as more than three episodes of OM in a 12month period with interval clearing of any middle ear effusion.

These data, together with concerns about increasing pneumococcal resistance, have resulted in a need for the more judicious use of antibiotics in recurrent OM, perhaps confined to infants under 2 years of age and those attending out-of-home child-care.
