In this study, there was signifi cant reduction of the absolute value of the difference between the surveyed value and the regression line from ROI 1 to ROI 5 in a onecompartment analysis and the fast component of a twocompartment analysis. We believe that the clearance rate differs with changes in the area of the hilar region excluded from the ROI, and this relation suggests that the mechanism of 99m Tc-DTPA clearance differs between the hilar region and peripheral alveolar regions. Several reasons for this difference in clearance rate have been suggested. One possibility is a difference between the alveolar and bronchial epithelia in the physiological mechanism of absorption of 99m Tc-DTPA. Bennett and Ilowite found that the epithelial absorption of 99m Tc-DTPA in vivo is more rapid in alveoli than in the bronchial airways. 12 Oberdorster et al. reached a similar conclusion through experiments in dogs that alveolar absorption of 99m Tc-DTPA is more rapid than bronchial absorption. 6 A second possible reason for the difference in 99m Tc-DTPA clearance rates between the hilar region and peripheral alveolar regions is that the diffusion distance from the airway surface to the capillaries is much larger in the bronchi than in the alveoli. Effros and Mason suggested that the rate of 99m Tc-DTPA absorption from the epithelial surface correlates with the ratio of the airway surface to the volume of the epithelial lining fl uid. This ratio is probably much smaller in the bronchi than in the alveoli because of the smaller surface area covered by a thicker layer of fl uid in the bronchi and the larger surface area covered by a thinner layer of fl uid in the alveoli. 13 A third possible reason for the difference in 99m Tc-DTPA clearance rate between the hilar region and peripheral alveolar regions is pulmonary damage caused by various diseases and factors, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 14 ; noncardiogenic pulmonary edema 15 ; asbestosis 16 ; coal worker's pneumoconiosis 17 and other pneumoconioses 18 ; human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) infection 19 ; interstitial lung diseases, such as sarcoidosis, 18 idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis, 18 hyaline membrane disease, 20 fi brosing alveolitis associated with systemic sclerosis, 21 and cryptogenic fi brosing alveolitis 21 ; cigarette smoking 22 ; use of crack cocaine 23 ; and radiation pneumonitis. 24 Increased pulmonary epithelial permeability increases the rate of 99m Tc-DTPA clearance, and thickening of the alveolar epithelium reduces diffusion and decreases 99m Tc-DTPA clearance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 813, "end": 820, "text": "Bennett", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 949, "end": 951, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1110, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1800, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2046, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2098, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2209, "end": 2211, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2263, "end": 2265, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2298, "end": 2300, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2390, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2480, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2510, "end": 2512, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We investigated the clearance rate of 99m Tc-DTPA by means of a two-compartment analysis in our defi ned ROIs.
