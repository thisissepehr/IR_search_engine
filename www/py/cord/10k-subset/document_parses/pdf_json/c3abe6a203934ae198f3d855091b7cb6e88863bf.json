The mortality rate was 26% (5/19). The survival was better than predicted by the Pediatric Respiratory Failure score (p<0.01). None of the scores differentiated survivors from nonsurvivors (p>0.25). There was no significant change in oxygenation index over the first 24 h (p>0.18). Of patients with an initial oxygenation index higher than 20 who did not have at least a 20% reduction in oxygenation index by the time 6 h, 6/9 (67%) survived (sensitivity 75%, specificity 57%). Conclusions: Survival in pediatric ARDS patients treated with HFO could not be predicted using several outcome scores or the oxygenation index (in the first 24 h). Survival was significantly better than predicted by the Pediatric Respiratory Failure score. A prospective randomized controlled trial of HFO in ARDS is warranted.",

The concept of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) has been advanced and the relative contributions of overdistention of alveoli (volutrauma), repeated opening and closing of alveoli (atelectrauma) and oxygen toxicity have been considered [1] . It is clear in animal models that each can significantly contribute to lung injury and the pathology of ARDS [1] . It is less clear in humans what the relative role of each is and the best way to minimize their effects. Emerging data suggests that both are, indeed, important and can affect the outcome of ARDS in humans [2, 3] , and the therapeutic roles of optimal PEEP and tidal volume limitation have become incorporated into common practice.",

Our current strategy is pressure limitation (to peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) less than 35 cmH 2 0) with permissive hypercapnia (pH >7.2) and optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to achieve a goal of FIO 2 below 65% with a minimal oxygen saturation of more than 85% (and PaO 2 of >60 torr [8 kPa] ). This is to attempt to minimize ventilator-associated lung injury. Failure of CMV is considered to occur if the above parameters cannot be achieved or maintained. This strategy has evolved over the past 6 years. During the period of the study the principles of permissive hypercapnia and optimal PEEP were the same; however, the exact limits of acceptable pressure, FIO 2 and PaO 2 were in evolution. The decision to start HFO was, at times, based on clinical discretion and often early in ARDS. The reasons for converting to HFO in this study are classified as: oxygenation (severe ARDS with PaO 2 /FIO 2 \u2264100), hyper-capnia (ARDS with PaO 2 /FIO 2 <150 and PaCO 2 >70 torr) or clinical discretion (ARDS in clinical progression).",

Arnold et al, reported, in their prospective trial [4] , that the strongest predictor of non-survival while on HFO was an OI of more than 42 at 24 h (odds ratio 20.8, sensitivity 62% and specificity 93%). In the adult pilot study [18] , a pretreatment OI of more than 47 predicted mortality with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. In contrast, Sarnaik et al. described that, on HFO, survival could be predicted at 6 h by the change in the OI [5] . Those with an OI pre-HFO of more than 20 and failure to decrease the OI by more than 20% at 6 h could be predicted to die with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 83% (odds ratio 33). We were unable to confirm this prediction rule. Moreover, using this rule in our population, 6/14 survivors were falsely predicted to die. In addition, one of our survivors had an OI pre-HFO of 103 and another of 43.5. At 24 h on HFO, although there was a trend towards improving OI, there was not a statistically significant improvement in OI in our population. This may be due to the small numbers of patients at that time point. Overall, our results suggest that OI at these early time points may not be an accurate predictor of mortality in patients managed with HFO for ARDS. 1767 survival was significantly worse than that predicted by the PICU admission day PRISM score. The actual survival was significantly better than predicted by the pre-HFO day PeRF (p<0.01). The PRISM, MOSF and PeRF mortality predictions in the survivors were not significantly different from that of the non-survivors. The exclusion of the two survivors who were on HFO for less than 2 h did not change these results.",

The challenge remains to oxygenate and ventilate these patients adequately without causing more harm in the form of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI). Volutrauma from overdistention of alveoli, atelectrauma from repeated opening and closing of alveoli and oxygen toxicity are the main complications associated with any form of mechanical ventilation [1] . Not only may these worsen lung injury, causing the pathologic equivalent of ARDS, they may also contribute to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and, hence, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [11] . Theoretically, HFO is an ideal way to recruit lung, keep it open and avoid overdistention; it allows the lung to be splinted open at a relatively constant mean airway pressure with very small tidal volumes [12] .",

This It is important that the patients in our study be comparable to those of previous studies in order for the above comparisons to be valid. In our study the average OI pre-HFO was 26\u00b121 and time on CMV prior to HFO was 1.6\u00b12.5 days (range 15 min to 11 days). This is comparable to the work of Sarnaik et al. [5] , where the pre-HFO OI was an average of 25 (25 th percentile 19, 75 th percentile 36) and the time on CMV prior to HFO was 38\u00b157 h (range 1-240 h). In the 12 patients in our study with an initial OI over 20, the reason for high OI was both MAP (20\u00b16.9) and FIO 2 (0.82\u00b10.17). This is similar to the study by Sarnaik et al., where all the patients were on an FIO 2 of 1.0 with the average MAP 20 cmH 2 0 (25 th percentile 16 cmH 2 0, 75 th percentile 22 cmH 2 0) [5] . In the study by Arnold et al. [4] the pre-HFO OI was 25.5\u00b19.6, comparable to our study; the time on CMV prior to randomization to HFO was longer, with a wide range, at 143\u00b1240 h. The OI in their study did not fall from pre-HFO values over the first 18 h of HFO, even in survivors [4] , a finding similar to our study. Therefore, our patients were similar to those in previous studies and a comparison to the prediction rule of Sarnaik et al. [5] is likely valid. However, we cannot completely rule out that the inability to confirm the prediction rule was due to patient differences, such as their being at an earlier time point in the evolution of ARDS.",

Survival was significantly better than predicted by PeRF. In addition, the OI at early time points could not help predict outcome on HFO as had been suggested by others. We conclude that HFO is a promising therapy for pediatric ARDS that may improve survival. However, like the many new therapies being used for ARDS, HFO must be subjected to a large rigorous prospective, randomized, controlled trial to delineate its role. HFO may be ideally suited for early use in ARDS to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury, multiple organ dysfunction and death.",
