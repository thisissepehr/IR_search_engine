This methodology allows for identification and genomic characterization of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses without the need for a priori knowledge of a specific pathogen directly from clinical specimens. Although there are increasing reports of mNGS successes, several hurdles need to be addressed, such as differentiation of colonization from infection, extraneous sources of nucleic acid, method standardization, and data storage, protection, analysis, and interpretation. As more commercial and clinical microbiology laboratories develop mNGS assays, it is important for treating practitioners to understand both the power and limitations of this method as a diagnostic tool for infectious diseases.",

The spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Candida auris and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative organisms and the reemergence of Ebola and Zika viruses highlight the ongoing challenges with diagnosis and management of patients with infectious diseases. Accurate diagnosis can be challenging due to a wide variety of pathogens causing clinically indistinguishable diseases. Current methods, such as culture, nucleic acid amplification tests, and serologic assays, generally require the use of a battery of tests to attempt to establish a diagnosis. Often times these methods still rely on a growth amplification step of viable microorganisms in culture for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing that take a minimum of 48 hours for commonly encountered pathogens and longer for more fastidious organisms (up to weeks for more insidious pathogens such as fungi and mycobacteria). Novel technologies such as syndromic multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels, 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) Sanger sequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) have decreased turnaround times and subsequently beneficially impacted patient care [2] . Despite these advances, the etiology of infectious diseases remains unknown in up to 60% of cases depending on the clinical syndrome [3, 4] . Missed diagnoses due to the limitations of current microbiologic methodologies drive the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics preventing the use of targeted, curative therapies.",

We refer the reader to other publications on this topic that summarize common terms and approaches used in DNA sequence analysis [10] , the different NGS technologies [11] [12] [13] , and the various NGS methods, bioinformatics tools [14] and clinical applications [10, 15] . This review will focus on mNGS for infectious disease diagnostic pathogen detection. Other applications of mNGS testing directly from specimens that are also not covered in this review include antimicrobial resistance gene and virulence gene detection, strain typing, and host immune response profiling [16] . mNGS, also known as unbiased or agnostic NGS or clinical metagenomics, is a method where all the nucleic acid (DNA and/ or RNA) of a specimen is sequenced in parallel. This results in isolation and amplification of both host and pathogen nucleic acid sequenced from the specimen (Figure 2 ). Additional sources of nucleic acid that may be concurrently sequenced include nucleic acid introduced at the time of collection, within collection tubes, from the environment, and in sequencing reagents. Due to these complexities and potential breadth of detection, interpretation of mNGS results directly from clinical specimens can be difficult and requires careful interpretation and consideration.",

Successful clinical applications of mNGS have demonstrated that 0.00001%-0.7% of total reads (10 to tens of thousands of pathogen reads out of a total of millions of reads) have been used to make successful diagnoses (Table 1 , mNGS results column). Pathogen reads make up a minute fraction of the sequencing results. Host nucleic acid can be depleted [18] or, if pathogen reads are enriched, more microorganism reads can be generated to more confidently provide a diagnosis and allow for increased analytical sensitivity (limit of detection). Additionally, if a robust immune response is generated in response to the pathogen, the specimen will contain a high concentration of leukocytes, further contributing to host nucleic acid in the sample and further limiting pathogen detection. Thus, the higher the sequencing depth (the higher number of reads generated/specimen) of the method, the higher the likelihood that the pathogen will be sequenced and detected (more reads equals higher sensitivity). For a conceptual illustration of how cellularity and overall nucleic acid affect analytic sensitivity, see Figure 1 in Schlaberg et al [4] . One potential advantage of sequencing amplified host nucleic acid is the opportunity to evaluate the host immunologic response associated with the presence and type of infection. This can include the presence of gene biomarkers associated with an antiviral or antibacterial response (specific expression of cytokines, chemokines, interferons, etc), genes involved in signaling pathways, and adaptive immunity. These biomarkers can provide insight into the pathogenesis of the microorganisms detected [19] .",

Initial applications of mNGS focused on detection of pathogens in normally sterile specimens, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain biopsies, simplifying the assignment of clinical significance for detected organisms [17, [20] [21] [22] [23] . That being said, even body sites that are considered normally \"sterile\" may contain a microbiome, which can be defined and detected by deep sequencing [24] . Reports in the literature are now showing applications from other specimen types where normal microbiota can further complicate interpretation of results, such as respiratory specimens [19, 25] . These methods will likely require further studies to determine the best approach to distinguish colonization from infection. Currently, mNGS is only able to quantify pathogen reads as a percentage of the total number of sequence reads. Clinical microbiology laboratories have developed procedures throughout the years to distinguish true pathogens from colonizers in cultures, and similar Targeted amplification of 16S rDNA from a clinical specimen for bacterial profiling. C, Metagenomic next-generation sequencing from clinical specimens. The nucleic acid composition of the specimens includes host (black), microbiome and pathogen detection (blue, green, and red), and last, the introduction of contaminating nucleic acid (orange). Analysis of reads generally involves removing host DNA from microbial DNA. The host DNA reads can be used to study the host immune response. The microbial reads are analyzed to identify the composition and abundance of reads of organisms present. The study of RNA can allow for transcriptome-based analysis to identify organisms that are transcriptionally active.

A recent example is the use of \"spike-in\"-based calibration to determine total microbial load as a proxy to convert percentage reads in relation to quantitating bacterial burden in colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter [26] . Another approach to distinguish colonization from infection is to monitor and assess the host immune response. Langelier et al found that expression of a multigene immune response composite metric was significantly increased in hematopoietic cellular transplant patients with confirmed respiratory pathogens relative to those without a defined pathogen. These results suggest that, even in patients who have significant immunosuppression, the immune response may be used as a biomarker of active infection when utilizing host reads from mNGS analysis of respiratory specimens [19] .",

            "text": "The capability of unbiased sequencing directly from patient specimens is what makes mNGS an ideal, hypothesis-free diagnostic tool for infectious diseases. However, it also brings challenges as nucleic acid contamination occurs at several steps in the process from specimen acquisition to specimen processing and the environment, making interpretation of results challenging. Samples should be collected with much caution; for example, lumbar punctures to obtain CSF specimens can be contaminated by normal skin microbiota during the procedure. Similarly, surgical specimens may be contaminated during handling of the biopsy [17] . In addition, specimen collection containers are ideally verified to be DNA/RNA free as they too may serve as a source of contaminating nucleic acid. The development and strict adherence of specimen collection guidelines are crucial for reducing risk of contamination introduced at the time of specimen collection [9] . Furthermore, many researchers have shown that most reagents utilized for mNGS also introduce extraneous, unwanted sources of DNA during the sequencing process; this phenomenon is referred to as the \"kit-ome\" [9] . A study by Salter et al demonstrated that extraneous DNA is ubiquitous in commonly used DNA extraction reagents and other laboratory reagents used for NGS. The contamination can critically impact results obtained from samples, especially those containing low microbial biomass [27, 28] . This becomes particularly relevant when there is a lack of an obvious pathogen (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or JC virus where they are not found as contaminants in reagents or part of normal microbiota) especially for mNGS analysis of CSF specimens where common reagent contaminants can include members of the Enterobacteriaceae or Cutibacterium acnes (previously known as Propionibacterium acnes), making clinical relevance difficult to discern. Thus, it is imperative that a no-template control (a sample [ie, water or extraction buffer] that is run through the entire mNGS procedure) be included in mNGS analyses to determine the nucleic acid background of the reagents used for sequencing. The no-template control can be used when interpreting results to help filter out contaminating background reads. In fact, the no template control has been utilized as part of a cutoff to determine the relevance of mNGS findings from patient specimens. A recent report used a cutoff of \u226510 ratio of the reads per million sample divided by the reads per million of the no-template control from any given taxon (species, genus, or family) [21] . Another approach is to align the reads to the genome of the pathogen to see if the reads span different areas of the genome. If the reads are localized to a restricted area of the genome, the reads are more likely to represent a contaminant, whereas if the reads span the genome, the organism is more likely to represent a true organism detection [29] .",

Thus, it is very important for the physician interpreting results to have a good understanding of the scope of the methods being applied as these impact the ability of the assay to detect certain pathogen types and affects interpretation of results. Methods of mNGS can include a DNA-and/or RNA-based approach. If a DNA-based approach is solely applied, pathogen types, except RNA viruses, will be detected. An RNA-based approach is required for detection of RNA viruses and further provides transcriptome-based analysis of other pathogen types and even the host immune response. A DNA approach will indicate what organism(s) are present, but an RNA approach can further reveal what organism(s) are transcriptionally active.",

This compares to 10 4-5 CFU/mL for detection of pathogens by special stains directly from a specimen (ie, Gram stain), 10 2-3 CFU/mL for growth in culture, and 10-100 CFU/mL for nucleic acid amplification-based methods [31] . It also varies by specimen type, as the limit of detection of mNGS for hepatitis C virus and HIV from plasma has been reported as high as 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL, as determined by quantitative PCR [32] . Use of an internal control is extremely important to identify analytic failures and specimens with unusual cellularity that may result in reduced analytical sensitivity. While a negative mNGS result does not completely rule out an infectious process, adequate recovery of the internal control can indicate the level of sensitivity achieved by the assay for that particular sample [4] .

This approach ensures that the most clinically relevant data are reported. Additionally, in the authors' experience, development of such a team was useful in determining direction of assay development and lobbying the institution for resources. Another approach, which is strongly advised, is to have an experienced laboratory director manually review the results prior to release [21] . SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS OF mNGS mNGS directly from clinical specimens came to the forefront when the Chiu laboratory from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) applied the methodology to achieve diagnoses in a case of neuroleptospirosis and a case of neuroinvasive astrovirus [22, 35] .

One particular case of chronic Cache Valley virus encephalitis in an Australian patient highlights the ability of mNGS to identify pathogens not previously associated with a clinical phenotype [23] . A single report of the accuracy of mNGS compared to standard methods of 84 previously positive CSF specimens and 21 negative specimens observed a diagnostic sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 93.7% following discordant analysis [4] . Some recent articles describe the utility of the assay for detection of respiratory pathogens directly from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from human stem cell transplant and lung transplant recipients [19, 25] . Table 1 summarizes the successful applications of mNGS in the literature to date (July 2017). All these studies have been performed using short read data (second-generation Illumina sequencing), with 2 exceptions. Recently, publications by Pendleton et al and Greninger et al demonstrated the utility of mNGS using the affordable, portable MinION sequencer (third-generation sequencing) that generates long reads with sequencing analysis that can occur in real time [25, 41] .

For the most part, the successful application of mNGS has occurred for diagnoses of severe, insidious infections or has been performed in retrospective studies compared to standardof-care results. Ideally, this technology would be applied in real time as an adjunct to current SoC testing. mNGS is currently being offered as a billable laboratory-developed test by both clinical and commercial laboratories. The question is, when should this rather expensive test be considered for clinical care? Based on the available literature, mNGS could be considered when SoC testing is unrevealing and can be used as a last resort effort to try to discern an infectious process. Alternatively, it may be considered for critically ill or severely immunocompromised patients where achieving a timely diagnosis is imperative for improved outcomes. Importantly, mNGS does not replace current SoC methods, but should rather be used as an adjunct to these methods. At this point in time, this question is still actively under investigation and further evidence is required to establish the use of mNGS in routine clinical care. CONCLUSIONS mNGS has emerged as a promising single, universal pathogen methodology for infectious disease diagnostics. In addition, mNGS will further be developed in years to come to evaluate antimicrobial resistance genes, strain typing, pathogen evolution, immune response to offending pathogens, and detection of virulence genes. As mNGS methods are still being developed and NGS technologies are rapidly evolving, there are still challenges ahead in terms of data interpretation and patient privacy. Infectious disease clinicians and other treating physicians can actively participate in the quality management of NGS diagnostic applications by appreciating the complexities and nuances of the methodologies being applied and ensuring that steps, as discussed in this and other reviews, are implemented to generate meaningful results beneficial to patient care.",
