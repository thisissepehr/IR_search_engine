Therefore, the sensitization to DRLs in the infected cells is probably common to many cell types in H5N1 infection and may contribute to the severe lung damage or lymphopenia observed clinically. Enhanced sensitization of virus-infected cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL or FasL has been reported in HIV, reovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus [16, [35] [36] [37] . This is caused by the up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 or Fas expression in virus-infected cells that leads to enhanced TRAIL-and FasL-mediated apoptosis. Other mechanisms that are responsible for the modulation of sensitivity or resistance to DRLs include the involvement of TRAIL decoy receptors [38] and the regulation of downstream molecules such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD), caspase 8, cellular FADD-like IL-1b-converting enzyme inhibitory protein, and mitochondrial factors [39] .
