In recent years it has been associated with severe and fatal disease. The extent to which P. vivax contributes to death is not known. Methods: To define the epidemiology of mortality attributable to vivax malaria in southern Papua, Indonesia, a retrospective clinical records-based audit was conducted of all deaths in patients with vivax malaria at a tertiary referral hospital. Results: Between January 2004 and September 2009, hospital surveillance identified 3,495 inpatients with P. vivax monoinfection and 65 (1.9%) patients who subsequently died. Charts for 54 of these 65 patients could be reviewed, 40 (74%) of whom had pure P. vivax infections on cross-checking. Using pre-defined conservative criteria, vivax malaria was the primary cause of death in 6 cases, a major contributor in 17 cases and a minor contributor in a further 13 cases. Extreme anaemia was the most common primary cause of death. Malnutrition, sepsis with respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, and chronic diseases were the commonest attributed causes of death for patients in the latter two categories. There were an estimated 293,763 cases of pure P. vivax infection in the community during the study period giving an overall minimum case fatality of 0.12 per 1,000 infections. The corresponding case fatality in hospitalised patients was 10.3 per 1,000 infections.

Five of the patients in the study died of extreme anaemia (probably as a result of high-output cardiac failure and acidosis), while severe anaemia was a major contributor in five other fatal cases. A study from Venezuela suggests that in areas of mixed species endemicity, anaemia may be a more frequent and severe sequel of vivax compared with falciparum malaria [20] . In Timika, the mean reduction in haemoglobin and risk of severe anaemia is greater for infants (<1 year of age) infected with P. vivax when compared with P. falciparum and, thereafter, the haematologic impact of P. falciparum exceeds that of P. vivax, [3, 21] . We have shown previously that 12% of all deaths at the RSMM are attributable to patients with severe anaemia and overall 6% of all cases of severe anaemia are attributed to vivax malaria [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1086, "end": 1090, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1348, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1352, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1545, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Overall, nearly half (44%) of the vivax-associated deaths had evidence of malnutrition and a high proportion of these individuals also had clinical or radiological evidence of possible concomitant bacterial infection.

One infant had an acute respiratory distress-type picture. Bilateral lung infiltrates consistent with acute lung injury were seen in 15% of all adult vivaxassociated deaths and in a third of those who had chest X-rays.

A study in Papua New Guinea has also highlighted the importance of respiratory distress in vivax malaria, although the degree to which this was attributable to P. vivax infection, associated anaemia or comorbid pneumonia was unclear [34] . Since microbiological data were not available in our study, we conservatively regarded any deviation in white cell count or infiltrates on chest X-ray as evidence of concomitant bacterial infection. In other studies, albeit without routine blood cultures for bacteraemia, severe and fatal sepsis syndromes have been attributed to vivax malaria [35] . Given the potential for P. vivax to cause an intense inflammatory response [36] and/or lung injury/ infiltrates [27] it is likely that we have significantly overestimated the contribution of infectious comorbidities and underestimated the direct contribution of vivax malaria alone to sepsis, lung injury and death. Nevertheless, our results suggest that, as with falciparum malaria, there may be a potentially fatal interaction between vivax malaria and bacterial infection, particularly pneumonia. To clarify this interaction, prospective studies of severe vivax malaria syndromes need to include systematic investigation for concomitant bacterial infection, including blood cultures [37] .
