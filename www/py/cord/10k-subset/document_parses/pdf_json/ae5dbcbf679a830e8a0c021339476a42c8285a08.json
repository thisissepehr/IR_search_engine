            "text": "The repeated DNA sequences that are dispersed throughout eukaryotic genomes have been divided into two classes (reviewed by Weiner et al. 1986 ). Both classes appear to transpose by an RNA intermediate, and the insertion of either class of repeated DNA generates short flanking direct repeats at the target site--hallmarks of transposition first recognized in prokaryotes. One class of repeated DNA resembles retroviruses in that members of this class are flanked by long terminal repeats (Baltimore 1985) . This class includes the yeast Ty-1 repeat, the Drosophila copia repeat, and the human THE1 repeat (Paulson et al. 1985) . Another class of repeated sequences resembles processed pseudogenes and lacks long terminal repeats (LTRs). This second class of repeats has been termed retroposons (Rogers 1983) , nonviral retroposons (Weiner et al. 1986) , and non-LTR retrotransposons (Xiong and Eickbush 1988) . In this paper, this second class of RNAtransposed repeats will be called retroposons. Two groups of retroposons have been identified based on their length: the short interspersed repeats, or SINEs, that are tess than 500 bp long, and the long inter- Repetitive DNA in the rabbit/3-like globin gene cluster. The 0-like globin genes ~, 7, 6, and/3 are shown as boxes along the 45-kb segment of cloned DNA (Lacy et al. 1979 ). Transcription of the active genes is from left to right. The location and orientation of L1 repeats are shown by the filled arrows. The L1 repeats are named LIOcl-L1Oc5 (Demers et al. 1986 ). The location and orientation of C repeats, a rabbit SINE, are shown by the open arrows.",

The sequence of one truncated L1 repeat and part of another repeat were presented as a composite sequence, and the ORF (corresponding to ORF-2) and 3' untranslated region were identified (Demers et al. 1986 ). In this paper, the rabbit L1 repeats are characterized more thoroughly, and the similarities and differences of L1 sequences between species are explored further. Interspecies comparisons reinforce the conclusion that the L1 repeat has two ORFs that are conserved for their protein-coding capacity. However, the region between the two ORFs is not conserved among species, and this observation is used to indicate possible start and stop codons for the ORFs. ORF-1 encodes a composite protein, and the 5' half of ORF-1 from L1Oc is related to type II cytoskeletal keratin.",

The flanking direct repeats differ for the two individual L 1 repeats, showing that they are not part of the L1 sequence. Such flanking direct repeats are often generated by insertion of transposable elements presumably by repair of a staggered break at the target site. The flanking direct repeats for L 1 Oc4 and L1Oc5 cannot be identified with the available data. The 5' end of L1Oe5 has not been cloned. Because L1 Oc5 is juxtaposed to LI Oc4, it is possible that L1Oc5 may have inserted into L1Oc4, in which case the 5' end of L1Oc4 is also not available. The only other L1 member, L1Oc3, does not have obvious flanking direct repeats generated by a duplication of the target site. The sequence GTTAAAAAAA found just 3' to the polyadenylation site (positions 6438-6447) is also found upstream from L1Oc3 (Margot et al. 1989 ). However, because the sequence GTT(A)7 (or a slight variation ofi0 is also found in all of the other L1 sequences just 3' to the polyadenylation signal, it is likely not to have been generated by a target site duplication around L1Oc3. This terminal repetition could be generated by insertion of a circular form of L1 by homologous recombination into a GTT(A)7 sequence at the target site.",

As shown in Fig. 4 , the 5'-most region of LIOc5 is represented about 11,000 times in the haploid genome of the rabbit, and regions of L1 located more 3' are found more frequently. The largest increase in copy number is seen in the region from positions 4351 to 6004 that includes the 3' untranslated region; this region is represented at least 66,000 times. However, the relationship between the length of the repeat and the copy number is not linear; only a gradual decrease in copy number is observed as probes going from position 4350 to position 1 are used (Fig. 4) . Therefore, many of the L1 repeats detected with the probe from the 5' end may be full length, indicating that up to 17% of the population of LIOc repeats could be full length. This difference in copy number at the 5' and 3' ends of LIOc repeats is also observed when uncloned genomic DNA is hybridized with the different L1Oc probes (data not shown). Thus, the lower copy number at the 5' end is not a result of underrepresenration in the cloned genomic library.",

Discrete genomic restriction fragments detected with L1Oc5 probes were mapped by two strategies. The portion of L 1 Oc contained within the genomic restriction fragment was determined by which probes from L1Oc5 hybridized to the fragment, and then the genomic restriction fragment was aligned with conserved restriction sites found in the cloned LI Oc DNA.

Also, ORF-1 appears to be a hybrid sequence because it is well conserved between species in the 3' half but it is not well conserved in the 5' half. Therefore, the sequence of ORF-1 and the region between the ORFs were aligned for the L1 repeats from rabbit, mouse, rat, and humans. Figure 8 shows both the aligned nucleotide sequences and the predicted amino acid sequences. Sequences that match well between species are in reverse text, whereas sequences that do not match well are in plain text. Inspection of the aligned L1 sequences allows a tentative identification of the start and stop sites of the ORFs. This analysis reveals that no overlap between reading frames is seen in rabbit and human L1 repeats. The end of ORF-1 in L1Md is the TAA at positions 1163-1165 (boldface in Fig. 8) . The same sequence is found in the rat L1 sequence (L 1Rn), and in-phase terminators are found nearby in L10c and L1Hs (boldface TAAs in Fig. 8 ). ORF-2 in L1Md begins in a different reading frame at position 1149, and thus it overlaps with ORF-1 for 14 nucleotides. By aligning the sequences of the different L1 s in the well-conserved ORF-2 region, it is apparent that an ATG is conserved in the rabbit and human sequences at positions 1235-1237. An in-frame ATG two codons upstream was previously identified as the start of ORFb in the L1Rn sequence (D'Ambrosio et al. 1986 ) and an ATG is also in frame in the L1Md sequence seven codons upstream. One can propose that the TAA close to position 1163 is the end of ORF-1 and the ATG at positions 1235-1237 is the start of ORF-2 in rabbit and human L1 repeats. In an independent analysis of several individual L1Hs repeats, these same codons were assigned as the end of ORF-1 and the start of ORF-2 in the consensus L 1Hs sequence (Scott et al. 1987) . As shown in Fig. 8 , ORF-2 is in the same reading frame as ORF-1 in the L 10c and L 1Hs sequences. Thus, the overlap in reading frames seen for L1Md is not observed in L1Oc and L1Hs. ORF-2 in L1Rn is in a different reading frame than ORF-1, but the L1Rn sequence does have an ATG proposed as the start of ORF-2. Thus, LIRn has overlapping reading frames, but the sequence in the overlap may not be used to encode a protein.",

This is the region of no similarity previously seen in dotplots (Fig. 6) . The sequence between the L1 ORFs is also not conserved in comparisons between the human and rodent sequences (Scott et al. 1987 ). Because this region is not conserved, whereas the sequences before and after it are conserved, probably for their capacity to encode a protein, it is unlikely that the inter-ORF region encodes a protein. This lack of conservation supports the proposed assignments for the start of ORF-2 in L1Oc and L1Hs. The mouse L1 sequence is ATA at positions 1235-1237; this same sequence is found in three sequenced members of the L1Md family (Shehee et al. 1987) .

The dissimilarity of the sequences makes it difficult to assign a start point to ORF-1. However, an ATG is found in the rabbit, mouse, and rat sequences at positions 240-242 of Fig. 8 (shown in boldface). An ATG is found three codons downstream in the human L1 sequence. Other ATG codons are either immediately adjacent (mouse and rat) or are 20 codons upstream (rabbit, underlined in Fig. 8) . The ATG at positions 240-242 has been tentatively assigned as the start of ORF-1, and the codons in Fig. 8 are numbered starting here. This is 71 codons into ORF-1 as defined by Loeb et al. (1986) . Although the N-terminal half of ORF-1 differs among rabbits, mouse, and humans, it is similar between the two rodents, mouse and rat. This region surrounds a 66-bp tandemly repeated sequence in L1Rn (Soares et al. 1985; D'Ambrosio et al. 1986) and contains several in-frame stop codons in L1Rn (Fig. 8) .

Although the L1 repeats from lagomorphs, rodents, and primates are similar in size and sequence organization, the 5' and 3' ends are distinctive (summarized in Fig. 11) . Also, the LI repeats I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I are located in different positions in orthologous regions of chromosomes, specifically the B-like globin gene cluster of rabbits and humans (Margot.el al. 1989 ) and mice (Shehee et al. 1989) . Because the contemporary /3-like globin gene clusters are descended from a preexisting gene cluster in the last common ancestor, the presence of L1 repeats at different positions in different species indicates that the L1 repeats have integrated independently into these gene clusters (and probably the whole genome) is each species. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the structure of the population of L1 repeats is quite similar in several mammals. Most members of the L1 repeat family in rabbits (this paper), mouse (Voliva et al. 1983) , and monkeys (Grimaldi et al. 1984 ) are truncated from the 5' end, resulting in a higher frequency in the genome of the 3' end of L1 (about 50,000 copies) than the 5' end (about 10,000 copies). This similarity in copy number suggests that the time of onset and the rate of propagation of L1 repeats is similar in the different species. The rabbit, mouse, and monkey L1 repeats also show a similar pattern for the increase in copy number in which the 5' regions increase gradually in copy number before a large increase in copy number at the very 3' end. This very large increase in copy number in the Y region could indicate a strong stop for reverse transcriptase during the conversion of the L1 transcript to a DNA copy. Given this frequency of polar truncations of L1 in rabbits, humans, and mice, it is striking that most of the L1 repeats in rats are full length (D' Am-brosio et al. 1986 ). Some aspect of the mechanism for synthesis and propagation of the Lls is apparently different in rats, e.g., to allow more full length reverse transcripts or to select for these in the integration process.",

Given the assignments of start and stop codons proposed in this paper, then transcripts of the L1 repeat of rabbits and humans have the characteristics of a dicistronic RNA. Polycistronic mRNAs are common in bacteria, and a polycistronic arrangement of genes is found in the genomes of some RNA viruses that infect animals and plants, e.g., togaviruses, coronaviruses, and tobacco mosaic virus. In contrast, most mRNAs from eukaryotic cellular genes are monocistronic. Regardless of whether the ORFs are overlapping, as in L1Md, or are part of a dicistronic RNA, as in L1Oc and L1Hs, the structure of the L 1 repeats resembles DNA copies of viral genomes more than conventional cellular transcription units. This suggests that the ancestor to L1 repeats in fact may be some type of animal virus rather than a normal cellular gene, as is often proposed (reviewed in Weiner et al. 1986) . A viral ancestor with a wide host range would provide an explanation for the independent, and perhaps simultaneous, entry of the L1 element into different mammalian genomes.",

Although ORF-2 is conserved in L 1 s from different orders of mammals it also seems to be a hybrid of sequences related to several proteins (Fig.  I 1) .

The 3' untranslated regions of orthologous globin genes in mammals have retained obvious sequence similarities over the course of eutherian evolution (e.g., Hardies et al. 1984; Hardison 1984) , so it is puzzling that no sequence similarity is seen in the 3' untranslated region of L1 repeats in comparisons between mammals (Fig. 11) . Perhaps the conserved coding region was fused tO a different 3' untranslated sequence in each species. It is noteworthy that the 5' end of L1Ocl begins immediately after the conserved termination codon that ends ORF-2, suggesting that the sequence corresponding to the 3' untranslated region of L 1Oc may exist as a distinct repetitive element in the rabbit genome in addition to its presence in the L1 sequence. If so, this would be an additional factor in explaining the large increase in copy number of Ll repeats in this region.",

The similarity has been 17 recognized only in the region proposed to encode reverse transcriptase, and these sequences are more similar among themselves than to retroviral reverse transcriptases (DiNocera and Casari 1987; Xiong and Eickbush 1988) . The mammalian L1 s and these protozoan and insect repeats share other structural features, such as the absence of long terminal repeats, the presence of at least two ORFs (ORF-2 containing sequences similar to reverse transcriptase and either ORF-1 or ORF-2 encoding a cysteine motif), a length from 5 to 7.5 kb, and a 3' untranslated region with a sequence similar to AATAAA close to the 3' end. The dicistronic structure proposed for L1Oc and LIHs may also be present in the I factor, the F element, and the R IBm repeat (Fawcett et al. 1986; DiNocera and Casari 1987; Xiong and Eickbush 1988) . Each type of repeated element also has some distinctive features, e.g., the specific insertion sites for R1Bm and R2Bm in the rRNA genes and the absence of A-rich tracts at the 3' ends of some of the insect repeats. However, at least parts of these repeats in mammals, insects, and a parasitic protozoan appear to be evolutionarily related. If this type of repeat is restricted to these groups of organisms, it may indicate that the genetic information was transferred among parasites, their mammalian hosts, and insect vectors (K.immel et al. 1987) . A viral progenitor, suggested by the dicistronic arrangement shown in this paper, would provide a means for the horizontal transmission of the L1 sequences.",

The positions of stop codons are indicated by vertical lines. The stop codon map for the L1 sequence from each species consists of the stop codons in the three reading frames of the top strand, followed by a diagram of the similar regions between species (indicated by the filled boxes--see Fig. 6), followed by the stop codons of the bottom strand.ORFs shown for L1Oc5 inFig. 7can be linked into two long ORFs by making substitutions found in LI Oc4, and by making insertions or deletions necessary to maintain the alignment of LIOc5 with regions of similarity of Lls from mouse or human(Demers 1987). Examples of such insertions to maintain the alignment can be seen at positions 798 (ORF-1) and 1445 (ORF-2) of the L1Oc5 sequence inFig. 8. By aligning the sequences of several human L1 repeats,Scott et al. (1987) recently concluded that L1Hs also contains two major ORFs. The diagram inFig. 7shows that the long region of simi-Alignment of mammalian L1 sequences in the ORF-1 region and the beginning of ORF-2. The sequences of L1Oc5 and L1MdA2 were aligned using the program NUCALN, and the sequences of the rat L1Rn sequence (D'Ambrosio et al. 1986) and the consensus human L1Hs sequence(Scott et al. 1987) were added by inspection, using the results of dot-plot analyses(Fig. 6)and plots of stop codons(Fig. 7)as a guide. In positions where the consensus L L Hs is degenerate, the nucleotide in L1Hs-TBG41(Hattori et al. 1985) was used. The names of the repeats are abbreviated Oc for L10c (rabbit), Md for L1Md (mouse), Rn for L1Rn (rat), and Hs for L 1Hs (human). The nucleotide sequence is numbered beginning with the third nucleotide of the L1 Oc5 sequence(Fig. 2), and the codons in the predicted translation frames for ORF-I and ORF-2 of L1Oc are also numbered. The sequence of LIMdA2 begins at position 1648 of Loeb et al. (1986), L1Rn begins at position 1092 of D'Ambrosio et al. (1986), and L1Hs begins at position 876 of the L] sequence in Scott et al. (1987). ORF-1 of L1Md, as defined by Loeb et al. (1986), begins at position 28, after the underlined TAA. The hyphens are gaps introduced to improve the alignment.
