            "text": "Introduction: The use of mesh fixation devices has become a subject of increasing debate in the minimally invasive surgical community, with recent data suggesting mesh fixation devices do not afford significant intraoperative and postoperative benefits in surgical outcomes. This relationship has not been investigated with regards to robotic transversus abdominis release (RTAR) for the repair of abdominal wall defects. We report our analysis of perioperative outcomes in RTAR candidates in whom fibrin glue was both used and spared during abdominal wall reconstruction. Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained hernia patient database was conducted identifying individuals who received either fibrin glue or no fixation during abdominal wall reconstruction via the RTAR technique from August 2015 to June 2017 at a single high volume hernia center. Perioperative data and postoperative outcomes between the two groups are presented with statistical analysis for comparison and quality of life measures assessed using the Carolina Comfort Scale. Results: Of the 30 patients identified, 21 underwent RTAR with the use of fibrin glue for mesh fixation (RTARG) and 9 underwent RTAR without the aid of any mesh fixation device (RTARNG) with no past medical history significant for hernia recurrence. The RTARG cohort had a mean BMI, defect area, mesh area, and operative time of 32.1, 197 cm 2 , 844 cm 2 and 222 minutes, respectively, compared to 32.1, 139 cm 2 , 898 cm 2 , and 287 minutes in the RTARNG group. All cases utilized medium weight macroporous polypropylene synthetic implantable mesh materials in both the RTARG and RTARNG subgroups. There were no reported postoperative complications, including no development of hematoma, seroma, or surgical site infections. Hernia recurrence was not identified in either the RTARG or RTARNG cohorts through a mean follow up of 220 days (7 months). There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative outcomes. Conclusion: Our series review suggests that the use of fibrin glue may not afford significant benefits compared to the use of no mesh fixation with the RTAR technique in the hands of an experienced surgeon. Additional expense associated with fibrin sealant may be unnecessary.",

            "text": "Introduction: Seroma formation and subsequent mesh non-incorporation are troublesome complications after complex ventral hernia repair with synthetic mesh placement. Although many times seroma will resolve spontaneously, failure of medical management often necessitates surgical intervention. Case Report: 39 year male presented with large ventral and parastomal hernia 2 years after end colostomy takedown with protective ileostomy performed after Hartmann's procedure 3 years ago. Past medical history included GERD, HTN and Morbid obesity (BMI 38.5 kg/m^2). The patient was offered ileostomy takedown, as well as ventral and parastomal hernia repair using a Tranversus Abdominus Release and retro-rectus composite mesh repair. Despite surgical drain placement with routine removal at 2 weeks, the patient returned 3 months post op with seroma, which was treated with percutaneous drain. By 6 months, a deep seroma had reformed in the retro-muscular space and a portion of the mesh was non-incorporated. The patient was re-operated with endoscopic debridement of the non-incorporated mesh as well as irrigation and drainage of the seroma without violating the primary closure of the abdominal wall. A wound VAC was applied through one of the incisions, and two closed suction drains were left, being removed at around 2 and half weeks. At three months the patient demonstrated complete resolution of the seroma. Discussion: Failure of seroma to respond to non-operative management represents a challenge in the post-operative management of patients undergoing complex ventral hernia repair. Open surgical intervention to explant non-incorporated mesh frequently leads to recurrence. Only very small case series are currently available to describe an endoscopic approach to this complication. We report a satisfactory outcome with endoscopic approach which combined partial mesh explantation and washout and drainage of the seroma cavity, with the benefit of avoiding alteration to the anatomy of the primary closure and avoiding recurrence.",

            "text": "Between 5-10% of Americans experience an inguinal hernia in their lifetime, however, only 1% of these hernias contain the vermiform appendix, which is termed an Amyand Hernia. Even more rare, is the 0.1% of the Amyand hernias which contain a perforated appendix. This hernia is difficult to diagnose and typically is an intraoperative finding. This rare inguinal hernia is named for Claudius Amyand, an English surgeon credited with the first successful appendectomy in 1735 when he removed the first vermiform appendix from a right inguinal hernia sac from an 11-year-old boy. Though Dr. Amyand recounted this surgery as \"quiet perplexing\", there are many ways in which a vermiform appendix can be appreciated in the inguinal canal: adherent or non-adherent, inflamed or non-inflamed, perforated or contained. The incidence of Amyand Hernia is 0.07-0.13% regardless of the stage of presentation. In the case presented here, the patient had a non-inflamed, reducible right Amyand's Hernia, which was repaired via laparoscopic appendectomy and laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal right inguinal hernia repair with mesh.",

The totally extraperitoneal hernia repair for inguinal hernia had already performed for many years. It had benefits at post operation hospitalization, wound pain, cosmetics. We believe that we can use the same approach for treatment the ventral hernia. We want to share our early experiences with this approach. We also evaluate the feasibility and post operation results. Methods: We performed the preperitoneal hernia repair with mesh for treatment ventral hernia since 2011, had already performed 37 cases. In this case of rectus abdominal diastasis patients and right flank hernia patient and left lower abdomen recurrent incision hernia status post mesh hernia repair with right lower abdomen incision hernia were performed at 2017. The demographic information and defect size were measured. Results: This rectus abdominal diastasis female was 41 years old. The rectal muscle distance about 7 cm. The operation time was about 4 hours. The right flank incision hernia male was 69 years old. The fascia defect was about 1098 cm. The operation time was about 2 hours. The left lower abdomen recurrent incision hernia status post mesh hernia repair with right lower abdomen incision hernia female was 60 years old. The left lower abdomen fascia defect about 795 cm and right lower abdomen fascia defect about 292 cm. The operation time was about 4.5 hours. The 3 cases blood lose were about 5 ml. The wound pain was VAS:4*5. They discharged from our hospital within the 24 hours postoperative period. The seroma was noted at right flank incision hernia patient. Conclusions: We shared our early experience with preperitoneal hernia repair with mesh. They showed benefits at post operation hospitalization, wound pain and cosmetic to compare with open approach.",

            "text": "Introduction: The challenges in hernia following liver transplantation are the types of incision, surgical site infection due to immunosuppressants and the multimorbidity these patients often present with. Therefore, patients with hernia after solid organ transplantation can be considered grade 2 according to the classification of the ventral hernia working group. The incidence for developing ventral hernia after transplantation has a wide variation according to literature. At our centre in Graz we have an incidence of 26%. Repair using mesh implantation reduces recurrence rates. Polypropylene mesh is prone to chronic contamination in immunosuppressed patients. Biomesh did not fulfill the expectations due to high recurrence rates and inflammatory reactions. P4HB bioabsorbable mesh seems to be a good alternative. It is a knitted monofilament, it degrades gradually via hydrolysis, it is fully resorbed after 18 months, while providing mechanical strength for 12 months, and it enables remodelling by host tissue. This mesh shows good results even in grade 3 morbidity wounds which we showed last year in a poster presentation at SAGES in Houston. Methods: In 2016 we treated 5 patients with incisional hernia following liver transplantation with P4HB mesh in onlay technique and small bites suture. Results: The follow-up period was between 10 to 20 months and still ongoing. No mesh had to be explanted, no surgical site infections, no delayed wound healing were observed. One hernia recurrence presented after 12 months with a 2,5 cm herniation along the left subcostal margin. 4 patients remained without complications and discomfort. Conclusion: Treating incisional hernia of patients after liver transplantation with P4HB mesh in onlay-enforced technique is feasible and safe. Of course, more data is needed. In order to lower the incidence of incisional hernia in this group of patients we are preparing a trial for prophylactic P4HB mesh placement in patients undergoing liver transplantation.",

            "text": "Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic surgery for totally extraperitoneal repair (SILS-TEP) of incarcerated inguinal hernia. Patients and Methods: Clinical setting A retrospective analysis of 14 patients undergoing SILS-TEP for incarcerated hernia from May 2016 to August 2017 at Kinki Central Hospital was performed. Exclusion criteria SILS-TEP was contraindicated for the following conditions in our hospital: a history of radical prostatectomy; a small indirect inguinal hernia in a young patient; and unsuitable for general anesthesia. Surgical procedure Laparoscopic abdominal exploration through a single, 2.5-cm, intraumbilical incision was performed. The incarcerated hernia content was gently retracted from the hernia sac into the abdominal cavity. In some cases, simultaneous manual compression on the incarcerated hernia from the body surface was required. If no bowel resection was needed, a standard SILS-TEP using mesh was performed following laparoscopic abdominal exploration and incarcerated hernia reduction. If bowel resection was required, inguinal hernia repair using mesh was not performed to avoid postoperative mesh infection, and two-stage SILS-TEP was performed 2-3 months after the bowel resection. Results: Fourteen patients (11 men, 3 women) with irreducible inguinal hernias, including 11 with unilateral hernias and 3 with bilateral hernias, underwent surgery. The patients' median age was 74 years (range, 38-83 years), and median BMI was 23.5 kg/m 2 (range, 18.8-30.5 kg/m 2 ). Of the 14 patients, 7 had acute incarceration, and 7 had a chronic irreducible hernia. Seven patients with acute incarcerated hernias underwent emergency surgery, and two of the seven patients needed singleincision laparoscopic partial resection of the ileum, followed by two-stage SILS-TEP. Twelve patients, excluding two patients who required single-incision laparoscopic partial resection of the ileum, underwent laparoscopic exploration with hernia reduction followed by SILS-TEP. One case of chronic incarceration out of the twelve patients who underwent SILS-TEP after hernia reduction required conversion to Kugel patch repair. The median operative times were 102 min (range 52-204 min) for unilateral hernias and 165 min (range 83-173 min) for bilateral hernias. The median blood loss was minimal (range 0-177 ml). The median postoperative hospital stay was 1 day (range 1-3 days). The median follow-up period was 7 months (range 1-15 months). A seroma developed in 25% (3/12) of patients and was managed conservatively. No other major complications or hernia recurrence were noted during the follow-up period. Conclusions: SILS-TEP, which offers good cosmetic results, could be safely performed for incarcerated inguinal hernia.",

            "text": "Objective: Introduction of MIS in pediatric age group has been proved feasible and safe. There is considerable evolution with introduction of a number of invovation in MIS pediatric inguinal hernia repair. High ligation of sac is the basic premise of surgical repair in pediatric inguinal hernias. There are different MIS techniques broadly grouped into intracorporeal or intracorporeal with extracorporeal component namely the suturing. Every techniques has its own complications. The main objective of our study was to focus on different anatomical pointers which can lead inadverent complications mainly bleeding and recurrence. Methods and Procedures: Prospective review of 37 hernias (29 male and 2 female) (8 months-13 years) performed laparoscopically between September 2015 and June 2016. Under laparoscopic guidance, the internal ring was encircled extraperitoneally using a 2-0 non-absorbable suture and knotted extraperitoneally. Data analyzed included operating time, ease of procedure, occult patent processus vaginalis (PPV), contralateral inguinal hernia, complications, cosmesis and recurrence. Results: Sixteen right (52%), 14 left (45%) and 1 bilateral hernia (3%) were repaired. Five unilateral hernias (16.66%), all left, had a contralateral PPV that was repaired (P=0.033). Mean operative time for a unilateral and bilateral repair were 13.20 (8-25) and 20.66 min (17-27 min) respectively. One hernia repair still recurred (2.7%) even with all precautions and another had a post operative hydrocoele (2.7%). One case (2.7%) needed an additional port placement due to inability to reduce the contents of hernia completely. because of our techinique we could not find any adverent peroperative bleeding. There were no stitch abscess/granulomas, obvious spermatic cord injuries, testicular atrophy, or nerve injuries. Conclusion: The results confirm safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. During our per-operative analysis we focus to address the anatomical landmark to minimize future recurrence and peroperative surgical complications. We identified and named a point as J. Point at the tip of triangle of \"Doom\". That is most important point to address peroperatively. There is high chance of recurrence if that point is not encircled well or inadequately circled because of fear of iliac vessels injury. We aslo concluded that 'water dissection technique' is effective techniques in un-experienced hand and in early stages of laparoscopic hernia repair to prevent inadvertent iliac vessels injury. 1 Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, 2 Georgetown University School of Medicine, 3 ",

Patients undergoing gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary surgery for malignant disease may be at higher risk for developing incisional hernias. Identifying these risk factors for incisional hernia development can help decrease occurrence. This will be the largest multi-institutional study looking at incidence of symptomatic hernia rates for major abdominal operations including colectomy, hepatectomy, pancreatectomy, and gastrectomy. Methods and Procedures: An IRB-approved retrospective study within the MedStar Hospital database was conducted, incorporating all isolated colectomy, hepatectomy, pancreatectomy, and gastrectomy procedures performed across 11 hospitals between the years of 2002 to 2016. All patients were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for relevant procedures and then subdivided into either having benign or malignant disease. Exclusion criteria comprised of patients who had concomitant organ resection, or those undergoing organ transplant. Data validation was performed to verify the accuracy of the data set. The rate of symptomatic incisional hernia rates (IHRs) were determined for each cohort based on subsequent hernia procedural codes identified and repairs performed. Descriptive statistics and chi squared test were used to report IHRs in each group. Results: During this 15-year span, a total of 7,583 major abdominal operations were performed at all 11 institutions, comprising of 4,970 colectomies, 1,122 hepatectomies, 1,165 pancreatectomies, and 326 gastrectomies. Malignancy was the indication for surgery in 2,178 (43.8%) colectomies, 747 (66.6%) hepatectomies, 763 (65.5%) pancreatectomies, and 207 (63.5%) gastrectomies. IHR in each cohort for benign vs malignant etiologies, respectively, are as follows: 193 (6.9%) vs 104 (4.8%) in colectomy (p=0.002), 12 (3.2%) vs 16 (2.1%) in hepatectomy (p=0.385), 17 (4.2%) vs 24 (3.1%) in pancreatectomy (p=0.431), and 4 (3.4%) vs 5 (2.4%) in gastrectomy (p=0.88) patients. Conclusion: Symptomatic incisional hernia rates following major gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary surgery ranges from 2.1 to 6.9%. There was no significant increase in hernia rates in patients undergoing surgery for malignancy. Patients undergoing colectomy for benign disease had a high incidence of symptomatic IHRs.",

The study aimed to evaluate the influence of mesh structure including the polymer type and mean pore size on bacterial adherence in a mouse model. Methods: Three commercially available hernia meshes were included in the study. For each mesh type, a 1 cm square was surgically placed intraabdominally in 6 mice. One mouse served as a control while an enterotomy was made in the subsequent mice to introduce a bacterial load onto the mesh. After 24 hours the meshes were harvested. The inoculated meshes were then plated on agar plates and bacterial counts were counted after 24 hours. The bacterial counts were compared between the various mesh types. Results: The mean bacterial adherence was increased in the large pore mesh was 695 colonies, for the small pore mesh was 892 colonies, and in the biologic mesh group it was 504 colonies. Conclusions: Through the use of a mouse model, the influence of mesh type and pore size on bacterial adherence was evaluated. Meshes that have larger pores with a lower prosthetic load and the biologic mesh interestingly had lower early bacterial colonization after 24 hours following an enterotomy. Further evaluation with a longer incubation time could be helpful to determine the effect of bacterial colonization of mesh.",

However, there is still debate on its use in large inguino-scrotal hernias, recurrent hernias and history of lower abdominal surgery anticipating adhesions and difficulty in dissecting extensive hernia sac. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was done of patients undergoing laparoscopic repair of large inguino-scrotal, incarcerated groin hernia, recurrent cases after open or laparoscopic repair and history of previous lower abdominal surgery. Between January 2013 to July 2015, 89 patients with large inguino-scrotal hernias, recurrent hernia, history of lower abdominal surgery, incarcerated femoral hernia underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Patient characteristics, operating time, surgical technique, conversion rate, complications and recurrence up to 18 months recorded. 51 patients had large inguino-scrotal hernia, 22 recurrent hernia (17 previous open, 5 previous lap) , 14 history of lower abdominal surgery (4 LSCS, 6 Appendectomy, 2 prostatectomy, 2 midline laparotomy), 1 incarcerated femoral hernia, 1 meshoma removal. 75 patients underwent total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair, 9 transabdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP), 5 needed conversion to open. Mean operation time was 74 min for unilateral and 118 min for bilateral hernia. Seroma formation seen in 19 patients, 2 minor wound infections treated conservatively. We conclude that the laparoscopic approach can be safely employed for the treatment of complex groin hernias; surgical experience in laparoscopic hernia repair is mandatory with tailored technique in order to minimize morbidity and achieve good clinical outcomes with acceptable recurrence rates.",

The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of permanent tack fixation versus absorbable when used alone or with suture fixation in laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs. A retrospective review of all patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia using tack fixation (absorbable/permanent) alone or in conjunction with suture fixation was queried from the AHSQC database. Outcome measures included hernia recurrence rate, pain, quality of life, wound related issues, and hospital length of stay. Propensity match scoring was performed to compare patients undergoing tack only fixation versus tack and suture fixation with a p-value of \\0.05 considered significant. A total of 804 patients were identified after propensity match scoring with 402 who underwent repair with permanent tacks alone or with sutures and 402 who underwent repair with absorbable tacks alone or with sutures. Following matching there were no differences in BMI, Age, Hernia Width/Length, or baseline pain/ quality of life. There were no significant differences found in outcome measures including recurrence rates, pain and quality of life outcomes at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year, surgical site infection (SSI), and postoperative length of stay (p[0.05). There was a significant increase in any post op complication in the permanent tack fixation group compared to the absorbable tack fixation group (21% vs 14%, p\\0.0003) which is likely due to the increase in surgical site occurrences noted in the permanent tack fixation group (14% vs. 10%, p\\0.005). Based on this large data set, there are no significant differences in postoperative outcomes in permanent versus absorbable fixation in laparoscopic hernia repair except in surgical site occurrences. Further study is needed to evaluate but at the present time, there is no convincing evidence that one type of fixation is superior to another in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.",

            "text": "Introduction: Inguinal hernia repair is the most common procedure in general and visceral surgery worldwide. Laparoscopic Transabdominal preperitoneal mesh hernioplasty (TAPP) has been also popular surgical method in Japan. Single incision laparoscopic surgery is one of the newest branches of advanced laparoscopy, and its indication has been spread to not only simple surgery such as cholecystectomy, but also complex surgery. We report our experience with single incision laparoscopic TAPP (S-TAPP) for Japanese patients with inguinal hernia. Case Description: A consecutive series of 290 patients (247 male, 43 female) who underwent S-TAPP during June 2010 to September 2017 in a single institution. Twenty eight of the patients had bilateral inguinal hernia. The mean follow-up was 1192 days. The average age of the patients was 61.2\u00b116.5 years. Establishment of the ports: A 25-mm vertical intra-umbilical incision is made for port access. One 5-mm optical port and two 5-mm ports were placed side-by-side through the umbilical scar. Surgical procedure: The procedure was carried out in the conventional fashion with a wide incision in the peritoneum to achieve broad and clear access to the preperitoneal space, and an appropriate placement of polypropylene mesh (3DMaxTM light, Bard) with fixation using the tacking device (AbsorbaTack\u00ae, Covidien). The hernia sac is usually reduced by blunt dissection, or is ligated and transected with ultrasound activated device. The peritoneal flap is closed by one suture with 4-0 PDS and the 6-7 tacks using AbsorbaTack\u00ae. Discussion: In one patient, we encountered a large sliding hernia on the right side having sigmoid colon as content of the sac, which required conversion to the conventional laparoscopic procedure. There were nine recurrence cases after surgery of laparoscopic or anterior approach, and two cases after prostatectomy. There was no intra-operative complication. The mean operative time was 87.4 \u00b131.1 min, and blood loss was minimum in all cases. The average postoperative stay was 5.4\u00b12.7 days. There was one recurrence case (0.3%) 16 months after the surgery. There was no severe complication after the surgery, but there were 15 seromas (4.7%) and one hematoma (0.3%). Two patients had blunt tactile sense in the area of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (0.9%), which improved in two months. Conclusion: Our results suggest that S-TAPP is a safe and feasible method without additional risk. Moreover, cosmetic benefit is clear. However, further evaluation for postoperative pain and longterm complications compared to standard laparoscopic TAPP mesh hernioplasty should be required.",

            "text": "Manuel Garcia, MD, Daniel Srikureja, MD, Marcos J Michelotti, MD, FACS; Loma Linda University Health Introduction: Prosthetic mesh use has become standard practice during ventral hernia repair to reduce the risk of recurrence. The ideal mesh is macro-porous which favors rapid cellular ingrowth and tissue integration, has limited tissue reactivity, low profile and weight, and has high tensile strength to add resilience to the repair. Additionally, the material is expected to have good handling characteristics. Currently, there is a wide variety of options for mesh. Biosynthetic material (poliglycolic acid/trimethylene carbonate -PGA/TMC) has been shown to behave well in terms of early vascularization and ingrowth as well as adequate long term tissue generation. GORE\u00ae Synecor\u00ae Biomaterial is a composite mesh including two layers of absorbable biosynthetic material (PGA/TMC) with one tridimensional non-absorbable macro-porous knit of dense PTFE mesh. It has shown good vascularization and ingrowth at 30 days in animal examination. However, there is still no evidence of long term behavior of this mesh in human tissue. We present the first histologic analysis of this mesh 1 year after placement in a human. Objective: To perform a histologic analysis of the GORE\u00ae Synecor\u00ae Biomaterial one year after placement in the human body. Methods: After incidentally finding incorporated GORE\u00ae Synecor\u00ae mesh in a patient with prior ventral hernia repair 1 year ago, during open bilateral inguinal hernia repair, a sample of mesh was taken and sent to pathology lab for analysis. Tissue healing, vascularization, and ingrowth of the composite mesh were analyzed. Results: Histologic findings significant for a biomaterial consistent with a knitted PTFE material surrounded by mature fibrovascular tissue and foreign body inflammation consistent with expected healing response for this time frame. No evidence of any other biomaterial (PGA/TMC) or evidence of infection. Conclusion: GORE\u00ae Synecor\u00ae Biomaterial has shown to be well integrated into appropriately healed tissue, with pronounced vascularization and ingrowth. The PGA/TMC layers have been seen to be completely absorbed and replaced by collagen. These findings, in a human 12 months sample, replicate what had been shown in animal specimens.",

The following data were collected from their records: age, gender, weight, age at graft rejection, surgical complications, treatment method and the treatment results with composite PTFE mesh. Results: For laparoscopic repair of Incisional hernia after renal transplant, the median interval between kidney transplantation and developing of incisional hernia was 64 (range 12 to 425) days. Predisposing factors were obesity, age over fifty years, and female gender. In six patients, hernia was large, and the repair was performed with using composite PTFE mesh. One patient had developed serous collection in surgical site, which was managed successfully with multiple punctures. Hernia recurrence or infection was not noted in these patients during 3 to 36 months follow-up periods. Conclusion: Incisional hernia is not a rare entity after kidney transplantation. Predisposing factors, such as obesity, age over 50 years, and female gender have a role in its development. Repeated surgeries in kidney recipients can increase the risk of incisional hernia.

Patient demographics, hernia characteristics, operating time, conversion rate, intraoperative, postoperative complications and recurrence were measured. Discussion: Total of 83 femoral hernias were repaired, 45 on right and 38 on left groin. This included 52 patients with bilateral and 18 unilateral hernia. 19 concomitant obturator hernia were found. There were 65 male and 5 female patient. No conversion was reported. One patient had injury to bowel at the 10 mm port entry site, without contamination, identified and managed immediately. 10 patients developed seroma, all were managed conservatively except one who needed aspiration. Peri-port bruising was noticed in 3 patients and 2 patients had hematoma. One patient with hematoma underwent excision of the organised hematoma.1 of the hematoma patient was on aspirin pre-operatively. No wound infection, chronic groin pain or recurrence was documented during follow up till date. Conclusion: Laparoscopic repair offers accurate diagnosis and simultaneous treatment of both inguinal and femoral hernia with minimum morbidity and good clinical outcomes. Better visualisation and magnification gives us an opportunity to identify occult hernias which can be repaired during the same setting, thereby reducing the chance of recurrence and possible need for second surgery. Laparoscopic repair has become the procedure of choice for the treatment of the majority of groin hernia at our institution. Introduction: Totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair that does not require peritoneal incisions is a good procedure that involves minimal visceral damage. However, balloon-or camera-assisted blunt dissections that are performed in a haphazard manner do not follow precise dissection of the fascia layer. Furthermore, they have a disadvantage in that they are difficult to understand anatomically. We therefore developed a novel preperitoneal approach to resolve this issue.",

            "text": "Methods: A 12-mm trocar is inserted into the rectus abdominis sheath cavity after a small incision is made below the umbilicus and the posterior rectus sheath is exposed. A 5-mm trocar is inserted 5 cm towards the pubic bone from the umbilicus. Using forceps from this position, narrow branches that enter the posterior rectus sheath from the inferior epigastric vessels are dissected, thereby broadly exposing the anterior surface of the posterior rectus sheath. The third 5 mm-trocar is inserted near the lateral margin of the rectus abdominis. On the outside, local anesthetic is injected beneath the posterior rectus sheath and the preperitoneal cavity is separated in fluid so that the peritoneum is not injured during posterior rectus sheath incision. A small incision is made to the posterior rectus sheath or attenuated posterior rectus sheath at one finger width higher than the expected upper margin of the prosthetic mesh. Due to the effects of local injection, a sharp incision to the fascia can be made with an electric scalpel. Utilizing this mechanism, the posterior rectus sheath aponeurosis and the lining transverse fascia and superficial preperitoneal layer are individually identified. Once the preperitoneal cavity is reached, the peritoneal margin is determined in the lateral direction, and the peritoneum that is pulled due to pneumoperitoneum is separated from the preperitoneal fascia on the outside from the cranial side towards the deep inguinal ring. On the inside, the pneumoperitoneum pressure pushes the peritoneum inferiorly, leading to enlargement and increased visibility of the posterior rectus sheath deep fascia, which is dissected one layer at a time from the outside. The umbilical prevesical fascia is dropped inferiorly, and the dissection of the preperitoneal cavity necessary for mesh deployment is performed. Results: By individually dissecting each fascia using emphysema through pneumoperitoneum and enlargement through local injection, the method for reaching the preperitoneal cavity could be successfully completed by following the dissection of the fascia layer without proceeding with the operation blindly, thereby resulting in the elimination of intraoperative bleeding and postoperative hematoma.",

            "text": "Introduction: In the field of abdominal wall reconstruction, the utility of drain placement is of debatable value. We present outcomes evaluating drain placement vs no drain placement at the time of robotic transversus abdominis release (RTAR) technique with placement of mesh in the retromuscular position, a currently understudied subject. Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained hernia patient database was conducted identifying individuals who received either drain placement or no drain placement during abdominal wall reconstruction via the RTAR technique from August 2015 to June 2017 at a single high volume hernia center. Perioperative data and postoperative outcomes between the two groups are presented with statistical analysis for comparison and quality of life (QOL) measures assessed using the Carolina Comfort Scale. Results: Thirty-five patients were identified for this study, of which 9 had drains placed intraoperatively in the retromuscular position at the conclusion of RTAR (DRN) and 25 underwent RTAR without the placement of draining devices (ND). The DRN cohort had a mean BMI, defect area, mesh area, and operative time of 37.1, 247 cm 2 , 940 cm 2 and 248 minutes, respectively, compared to 31.8, 157 cm 2 , 822 cm 2 , and 305 minutes in the ND group. All cases utilized medium weight macroporous polypropylene synthetic implantable mesh materials in both the DRN and ND subgroups. There were no reported postoperative complications, including no development of hematoma, seroma, or surgical site infections in either group. Hernia recurrence was not identified in either the DRN or ND cohorts through a mean follow up of 200 days (6.7 months). There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative QOL outcomes. Conclusion: Our series review suggests that the use of intraoperative drains may not afford any benefits with the RTAR technique when mesh is placed in the retromuscular position. Additional postoperative management associated with drain care may be unnecessary.",

Outcomes included operation time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the concurrent effects of various factors on the rate of postoperative complications. Objective: Small bowel perforation has conventionally been dealt with open exploration, which frequently leads to many wound-related complications. Wound infection is the major reason for increasing morbidity in these patients and delay recovery. Laparoscopic surgery has various benefits over open surgery like, smaller wound, lesser pain and faster recovery. The aim of this study was to relay the advantages of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to patients with small bowel perforation to decrease postoperative wound complications and duration of hospital stay. Methods: It is a retrospective study, including 136 patients with small bowel perforation from 2013 to 2016. Of these 136, 43 had traumatic etiology, 28 had typhoid-related perforation and the remaining 65 had a duodenal perforation. 84 of them were male, and the average age was 30.4 years. Only patients who presented within 96 hours of perforation were included in the study. Laparoscopic exploration was done on introducing camera from 10-mm infraumbilical port after intraperitoneal carbon dioxide insufflation. The remaining two 5-mm working ports were then introduced depending on the site of perforation once identified. The perforations were then repaired using intracorporeal single-layer suturing using Polydioxanone 3-0 suture. The peritoneal cavity was given thorough lavage and abdominal drain placed in the pouch of Douglas.",

Conclusion: We conclude from our study that laparoscopic intervention in early small bowel perforation is a safe approach with favorable outcomes, especially with regards to wound complications, that are a major factor in increasing the morbidity in such patients postoperatively. Laparoscopic approach leads to early discharge and recovery postoperatively.

            "text": "Introduction: Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), or gas in the bowel wall, can be seen on various imaging modalities. The pathophysiology behind PI is unclear. One theory proposes a mechanical cause (e.g. small bowel obstruction) while another proposes a bacterial etiology. Management of PI in adults is difficult as often there is a benign clinical course. However, when paired with specific clinical features such as hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) on imaging, the course of management changes as the suspicion of bowel ischemia increases. HPVG alone has been associated with a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. Management in this case becomes surgical. Case Presentation: We present a case of 59-year-old Latino male who presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and altered mental status. Focused physical examination revealed a non-rigid abdomen, no rebound tenderness, no guarding, and diffuse tenderness only to deep palpation. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated moderate portal venous gas in the right and left hepatic lobes, an upper midline dilated small bowel loop with pneumatosis intestinalis, and a moderately distended stomach with gas and fluid. Laboratory studies revealed metabolic acidosis and a lactic acid level of 2.9 mmol/L. Due to these findings, bowel ischemia was suspected, and the patient was taken to the operating room for a diagnostic laparoscopy. The laparoscopy was converted to an exploratory laparotomy due to extensive adhesions. Intraoperatively, there was no small bowel compromise and no identifiable transition point. Extensive lysis of adhesions and repair of iatrogenic enterotomy were performed. Patient tolerated the procedure well, clinically improved, and was discharged from the hospital. Discussion: This case illustrates the difficulty in management of a patient with pneumatosis intestinalis and, specifically, hepatic portal vein gas seen on CT imaging. HPVG has traditionally been a harbinger of morbidity and mortality, but exploratory laparotomy revealed only diffuse abdominal adhesions and the absence of bowel ischemia despite high clinical suspicion.",

There is little consensus as to the best surgical technique for complex scenarios. Often these patients have complicating co-morbid conditions such as radiation therapy, that has an inevitable effect in the abdominal wall structures, which can lead to non-traditional repairs. Case Report: We present a case of a 62 year-old female who underwent a TAH/BSO and right hemicolectomy which was complicated by wound dehiscence. She underwent primary repair and adjuvant whole pelvis radiation for her squamous cell carcinoma. Subsequently, the patient developed acute obstructive symptoms do to a stricture within her small bowel and a large ventral hernia measuring 14913 cm with non-reducible abdominal contents below the level of the fascia more prominent in the suprapubic area. The patient's BMI was 15.3. Various considerations are important in planning a surgical repair in a previously irradiated field with loss of domain which include, minimal dissection, and the use of an atraumatic surgical techniqueque with either external oblique release or transversus abdominis muscle release (TAR). We chose a A TAR, as it provides wider myofascial release and dissection below the arcuate line towards the space of Retzius and Bogros allowing for a larger sublay mesh placement. Also it avoids the need of skin flaps reducing the risk for wound complications in under-perfused tissue.",

The traditional model of call scheduling consisted of one senior attending and one senior resident on call per 24-hour shift. Attendings were responsible for consults, previously scheduled operations, as well as clinic time. Multiple recent studies have shown statistically significant improvements in several parameters of patient care by using ACS including but not limited to 1. Time from emergency department to surgical evaluation 2. Time from surgical evaluation to operating room 3. Operative time 4. Percent laparoscopic 5. Length of hospital stay 6. Intra-operative complications (blood loss, perforation rates) 7. Post-operative complications (fever, infection, redo) 8. Cost. One study demonstrated a statistically significant cost savings for the Acute Care Surgery model with respect to appendectomies, but not cholecystectomies. Study Design: A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent cholecystectomy in the setting of non-traumatic emergent cholecystitis was performed to compare data from two cohorts: the traditional model and the ACS between January 1, 2013 and Dec 1, 2016 at Ochsner Medical Center, a 600-bed acute care center in New Orleans. Parameters gathered included 1. Time from emergency department to surgical evaluation 2. Time from surgical evaluation to operating room 3. Operative time 4. Percent laparoscopic 5. Length of hospital stay 6. Intra-operative complications (blood loss, perforation rates, conversion to open) 7. Post-operative complications (fever, infection, redo). Demographics were also collected including age, weight, height, ethnicity, ASA, etc. Inclusion criteria included: Age[18 and having undergone cholecystectomy between Jan 1, 2013 and December 1, 2016. Exclusion criteria included choledocholithiasis, gallstone pancreatitis, ascending cholangitis, gangrenous cholecystitis, septic complications precipitating further procedures and delays, or researcher discretion. Results: 699 patients were initially identified as having undergone cholecystectomy within the allotted time period [2013 -178, 2014 -166, 2015 -157, 2016 -198] . 470 were excluded due to one of the reasons above.

He lodged the device against his right abdomen while the air hose was still attached and then accidently fired 2 nails into his abdomen. After he unsuccessfully tried to pull the nails out he drove himself 25 minutes to our emergency room. He was hemodynamically stable on arrival; pain control was achieved, antibiotics were given and he received tetanus immunization. CT-scan showed the two foreign bodies penetrating from the RUQ with one reaching the transverse colon. On emergency laparoscopy, the nails were found to have penetrated the thick omentum and the puncture site of one nail into the colon was identified. The omentum was resected off the colon and the right colon was completely mobilized. No additional injuries were found. The entrance area of the nails was then used to create a loop colostomy. The postoperative course was initially uneventful but the patient developed a severe posttraumatic inflammatory reaction of the fat tissue in the right upper quadrant and had to be readmitted for pain control and antibiotics were again administered. He recovered and was discharged with a plan for laparoscopically assisted colostomy closure after 6 weeks. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported isolated colonic injury by a nail gun. Given the tremendous force of the device with unknown collateral damage to the surrounding tissue it was decided to manage the accident with a laparoscopic assisted colostomy using the entrance point of the nails for fecal diversion.",

Obturator hernias are frequently complicated by ileus and the diagnosis is often first made from abdominal CT. Obturator hernias are difficult to reduce, and often necessitate emergency surgery. They are common in elderly people, and they often had bad general condition. So it was high in the death rate. At our hospital, we first attempt to reduce the hernia from the body surface under ultrasonographic guidance. After relieving the strangulation, we perform radical operation electively in patients who are for possible for surgery under the general anesthesia. We perform laparoscopic repair for obturator hernias. Obturator hernias are often complicated by other types of hernia. In these cases, we perform total repair. Herein, we present a review of the patients who underwent surgery for obturator hernia at our hospital. Methods: We review the data of 9 cases of obturator hernia encountered by us from February 2012 to December 2014. We performed total repair in three of the cases. However, it is difficult to procure a mesh that would be adequate for all the defects (inner inguinal ring, femoral ring, obturator). No single mesh can fit, because the inguinal and pelvic curves present opposing curves near the obturator. Therefore, we placed two pieces of mesh available at our hospital (3D max [Bard] and onlay sheet of Kugel patch [Bard] ) together in the patientsWe could successfully cover all the defects using these two pieces of mesh and could fit the mesh to the pelvic shape by devising an appropriate connection between the meshes. Results: We reviewed a total of 9 operated cases for obturator hernia. The hernia was bilateral in 7 cases, and complicated by other hernias in 6 cases. We first determined the appropriate approach for the repair. We performed total repair in 3 cases. They were no complications and no cases of recurrence.",

In bariatric patient's post gastric bypass there is a high index of suspicion for internal hernias as well as a low threshold to operate. There have been some debates around the closure of the potential Peterson's space with several studies advocating closure versus some which show that there is no difference in the rate of symptomatic internal hernias. We present a case of an unusual cause of small bowel obstruction due to internal hernia caused by a cecal volvulus. It is an atypical presentation however the patient was triaged and brought to the OR within 5 hours of admission. Although it is rare there have been reports of internal hernias caused by other structures like congenital bands or natural potential spaces. There have been reports of unusual presentations of the cecum herniating through the foramen of Winslow. The anatomical rearrangements after bypass create potential areas where an internal hernia can occur. In this case a bowel resection was undertaken due to the anatomical variation of the cecal bascule and cecal volvulus due to high rate of recurrence of this cecal pathology. Majority of internal hernias do not require bowel resection especially when detected earlier and prompt surgical exploration is undertaken. Mortality as direct consequence internal hernia is extremely rare. However late diagnosis of internal hernias can lead to catastrophic gut loss and may require lifelong TPN and/or visceral transplantation or autologous reconstruction. Conclusion: Careful history and physical of our bariatric patient can elicit the signs and symptoms of internal hernias and prevent the morbidity and mortality that can come with the complications of this condition. Unusual presentations and causes are reason for prompt diagnosis and complete exploration.",

We present the safety and efficacy of the Laparoscopic approach to this complication in the acute care setting. Depicted is an otherwise healthy 40 year old female with no previous surgical history who presented to the ED with worsening abdominal pain for one week with no associated symptoms. On physical exam, patient was non toxic. Abdomen was moderately distended with guarding and rebound tenderness to palpation, no rigid. Patient had been seen shorlty prior to ED admission by her OBGYN and recent work up with abdominal/pelvic x-ray and ultrasound has revealed a misplaced IUD in the transverse position (side ways). Pregnancy test was negative. Based on patient clinical presentation and recent radiologic findings, we decided to proceed with Diagnostic Laparoscopy. After systematic review of cavity, the foreign body was found to be incorporated within the greater omentum. We procceded, laparoscopically with omentectomy+foreign body removal. There were no perioperative complications, patiet was discharged on the following day. The use of laparoscopy in elective IUD retrieval within in the abdominal cavity has been considered standard of care in surgical management to date. This poster demonstrates its use as an effective approach for safe removal of intra-abdominal foreign bodies also in the acute setting.",

However, little is known about how often these patients present prior to eventual repair and whether they undergo surgery at the initial presenting institution. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical flow of patients presenting in the ED for inguinal and umbilical hernia. Methods: All patients presenting to EDs in New York State from 2005 to 2014 with symptomatic inguinal and umbilical hernias were identified using the New York State longitudinal hospital claims database (SPARCS). Patients were followed for records of hernia repair and subsequent inpatient and outpatient visits up to 2014. Results: 42,950 patients presenting to the ED for symptomatic inguinal hernia were identified. 5.3% (2, 297) of ED presentations resulted in inpatient admissions. 14,491 (33.7%) had repair later and their average time from ED presentation to inguinal hernia repair was 158 (\u00b1351) days. 90.1% of patients who did not have subsequent surgery had only one ED visit. Of those that underwent interval repair, 79.7% had only one ED visit prior to surgery. For those patients with only one ED visit before repair, 29.3% had repair at a different hospital, as opposed to 48.6% if multiple ED visits were made. 15,297 umbilical hernia patients presenting to the ED were identified. 7.2% (1, 109) resulted in inpatient admission. 3,507 (22.9%) had interval repair, with the average time from ED presentation to umbilical hernia repair being 175 (\u00b1369.82) days. 92% of patients who did not record of later repair presented to the ED once. Of those patients who underwent repair, 78.5% did so after one ED visit. For those patients with only one ED visit before repair, 32.9% had repair at a different hospital, as opposed to 48.6% if multiple ED visits were made. Conclusion: A majority of patients with symptomatic inguinal and umbilical hernias that present to the ED do so once with no subsequent follow-up or repair. For those patients that undergo interval repair, a significant portion willnopt for surgery at other hospitals. A significant proportion of patients with acutely symptomatic inguinal/umbilical hernias who undergo interval repair after a previous ED visit, will opt for definitive surgery at another hospital facility. This represents a missed opportunity for continuity of care for providers and healthcare systems.",

APACHE II was able to predict postoperative respiratory complications, post-operative need for ventilatory support, hospital stay duration and Mortality while MPI was able to predict post-operative wound dehiscence, post-operative respiratory complications, post-operative need for ventilatory support and Mortality. Neither APACHE II nor MPI could predict postoperative anastomotic leak and postoperative wound infection. Conclusion: Mannheim Peritonitis index is a useful and simple method to determine outcome in patients with peritonitis. MPI is comparable to APACHE II in assessing the prognosis in perforation peritonitis and can well be used in emergency setting in place of APACHE II scoring when time is a definite constraint.",

Objectives: Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic, multisymptom illness marked by cognitive and mood dysfunction and disrupted neuroendocrine-immune homeostasis affecting 30% of GW veterans. After 25+ years, useful treatments are lacking and its cause is poorly understood, although exposures to pyridostigmine bromide and pesticides are consistently identified among the strongest risk factors. Previous work in our laboratory using an established rat model of GWI identified persistent elevation of microRNA-124 (miR-124) levels in the hippocampus whose gene targets are involved in cognition-associated pathways and neuroendocrine function, suggesting that miR-124 inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the complex symptoms exhibited by GWI. The purpose of this study was to identify broad effects of miR-124 inhibition in the brain by profiling the expression of genes known to play a critical role in synaptic plasticity, glucocorticoid signaling, and neurogenesis in GWI rats administered a miR-124 antisense oligonucleotide (miR-124 inhibitor). Methods and Procedures: Nine months after completion of a 28-day exposure regimen involving GW-relevant chemicals and stress, rats underwent intracerebroventricular infusion of miR-124 inhibitor (n=9) or scrambled negative control oligonucleotide (n=8) and were implanted with 28-day osmotic pumps delivering 0.1 nmol/day. Intranasal delivery of oligonucleotides was performed on additional rats (n=4 per group; daily for 10 days) to determine whether miR-124 inhibition is achievable using a noninvasive procedure. Hippocampi were harvested and quantitative PCR arrays were used to profile the expression of focused panels of genes important for 1) synaptic alterations during learning and memory, 2) signaling initiated by the glucocorticoid receptor (known miR-124 target), and 3) neurogenesis. Hippocampi were also analyzed by quantitative PCR to examine expression levels of endogenous miR-124.",

Altered gene expression and a reduction in miR-124 levels were not observed in rats after intranasal delivery. Conclusion: miR-124 antagonism in the hippocampus upregulates the expression of several downstream targets involved in synaptic plasticity, glucocorticoid signaling, and neurogenesis and is a promising therapeutic approach to improve cognition, emotion regulation, and neuroendocrine dysfunction in GWI.

            "text": "Background: The ultrasonic dissector, commonly known as the harmonic scalpel, has been in use for achieving haemostasis in surgery for almost 20 yrs. Its advantages in breast surgery, especially in the dissection of axilla, have been a matter of debate as previous studies have shown inconsistent results. This study compares the outcomes of the ultrasonic dissector in axillary dissection with that of the conventional electrocautery. Methods: Patients who were undergoing MRM and BCS with axillary dissection from November 2014 till March 2016 were included in the study. Patients were randomized into two groups, group A undergoing axillary dissection with ultrasonic dissector and group B with electrocautery. The operative time, intra-op bleeding, post-op pain, post op drain volume, hospital stay and any other complications were noted in the two groups. Results: The numbers of patients in both groups were 35 each. Group A had a significantly shorter operative time, both for axillary dissection (30.86 min vs. 40.63 min, p\\0.001) and the total duration (77.20 vs. 90.20 min, p=0.001). The blood loss was significantly less in group A, as measured by the mop count. There was significant reduction in the total post-op drainage volume, which resulted in fewer days of drain in-situ and the total number days stayed in the hospital. There was no significant change in the post-op complications such as haematoma, seroma, flap necrosis, oedema, etc. Conclusion: With the use of ultrasonic dissector, the operative time, blood loss and the axillary drainage was significantly reduced. The axillary drainage in turn, reduced the hospital stay. There was no significant difference in terms of complications like haematoma formation, seroma formation, skin flap necrosis or oedema. For the statistical analysis, \u03c72 or Fisher's exact tests to compare proportions and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for analysis of values with abnormal distribution were used. Discussion: The study included 579 patients. All preoperative laboratory indicators were elevated. The laboratory tests do not demonstrate any statistical significance between these two groups. The group of the patients without stones in the CBD diagnosed by IOC was also divided in patients with diameters\\0.8?mm and with diameters\u22650.8?mm of the CBD. Also in these two groups, the statistical analysis of the laboratory tests does not demonstrate significant difference. All patients underwent IOC. IOC showed stones in 84/113 patients (74. 3%) . A comparison of patients with and without stones at IOC showed similar mean times from hospitalization to surgery (5.9 Background: Housed in a high volume tertiary referral center, our division receives a large amount of transfers and referrals from outside institutions for patients who require completion cholecystectomies. In this study \"completion cholecystectomy\" refers to patients that meet one of three criteria: 1. previous subtotal cholecystectomy, 2. previously aborted cholecystectomy, or 3. previous cholecystectomy with incidental finding of cancer on pathology. Traditionally, exploration of a reoperative field in the right-upper quadrant mandates an open approach due to dense adhesions and inflammation. Over the past few years, we have found that robotic-assisted surgery has allowed us to perform these completion cholecystectomies in a minimally invasive fashion. Methods: Case logs and operating room billing logs were reviewed from 2010 to 2017 to identify all robotic-assisted cholecystectomies performed at our institution. Review of all reports identified 30 completion cholecystectomies. All additional variables including demographics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were determined from manual chart review of all consultation notes, operative reports, anesthesia records, progress notes, discharge summaries, and postoperative office visits.",

Although traditionally performed in an open approach, we have had success in recent years at our institution with a robotic-assisted approach to completion cholecystectomy. We feel that the robotic approach offers certain advantages in a hostile, reoperative field which allows us to perform these procedures in a minimally invasive fashion with no conversions to an open procedure to date. Previously limited to case reports, this report of 30 procedures represents the largest case series of robot-assisted completion cholecystectomies to our knowledge. S152 Surg Endosc (2018) 32:S130-S359 Background: Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube (PCT) has been used as a bridge treatment for grade II-III moderate to severe acute cholecystitis (AC) to \"cool\" the gallbladder down over several weeks and allow the inflammation to resolve prior to performing interval cholecystectomy (IC) and removal of the PCT, often laparoscopically. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of timing of IC after PCT on operative success and outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review of electronic medical records of patients who were treated for AC with a PCT, and subsequently underwent IC at our institution between January 2005 to December 2016 was performed. The patients were divided into three groups (n=7 each), based on the duration of the PCT prior to IC, and these groups were comparatively analyzed. A comparative sub-analysis of clinical outcomes between patients who underwent surgery within the first week vs. third week or later after PCT was also performed.",

There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups in regards to age, gender, BMI, imaging findings, and indications for cholecystostomy tube placement. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in outcomes between performing IC within the first 5 weeks, 5-8 weeks and [8 weeks after PCT placement. The length of stay, overall morbidity, Clavien-Dindo grade of complications and mortality were similar between the 3 time intervals. However, a sub-analysis showed that patients who underwent IC within the first week of PCT placement had statistically significant higher mortality rate (p=0.048) compared to those who underwent IC[3 weeks of PCT placement. The two patients who died in our sample had IC within a week after PCT placement. Even though there was a statistically significantly higher morbidity rate in those who had IC[3 weeks after PCT, the Clavien-Dindo grade of these complications was lower than. Conclusion: Delaying IC to [5 weeks after PCT placement for AC is not associated with any improvement in patient morbidity, length of stay or rate of conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy within the first week of PCT placement is associated with higher mortality rate than after 3 weeks likely due to associated sepsis. Introduction: The effect of intraoperative bile spillage during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) on operative time (OR time), length of stay (LOS), postoperative complication rates, and 30 day readmission rates was analyzed. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard operation for gallbladder disease in the United States. Number of studies have shown that same day discharge in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is feasible and safe. Bile spillage during this procedure can be a common occurrence in teaching institutions, however, data on the effects of operative outcomes is lacking.",

Patient data was collected on demographics, comorbidities, bile spillage, operative findings, complications, LOS, and 30 day readmission rates. Statistical analysis was performed using IMB SPSS Statistics v. 19. Covaried analysis of variance (ANCOVA) was performed on continues variables and significance levels were calculated. Pearson's Chi Square significance level was calculated for all binomial variables.

Surgical Unit ll, Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi. Patients and Methods: Thousand patients with a diagnosis of cholithiasis were included. Exclusion criteria are patient younger than 12 year and older than 80 year. Calot's triangle dissection was done meticulously. Cystic artery and hepatic artery anomalies and variations were observed and analyzed on SPSS 21. Results: The age varies from 12 to 80 years. On the basis of distributional variation the cystic artery was single in 90% cases, branched in 7% cases and absent in 3% cases. On positional variations the cystic artery was superomedial to the cystic duct in 85% cases, anterior in 7% cases, and posterior in 3% cases and low lying in 5% of the cases. On the basis of length variation results showed that 800 (80%) cases had a normal cystic artery. A short cystic artery was found in 150 (15%) cases and a long cystic artery was present in 50 (5%) cases. Other arterial variations are of hepatic artery i.e Moynihan's Hump (3%) and and right hepatic artery present in calots triangle in 5% Conclusions: For the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy one should be well aware of the anatomical variations of the cystic and hepatic artery.

Majority were secondary to gallstones (n=197, 69%), and 53 (19%) were due to malignancies. 140 (49%) and 8 (3%) patients fulfilled SIRS and qSOFA criteria of severity respectively. 142 (50%) and 93 (33%) of patients had a TG13 severity grading of moderate and severe respectively. Nine (3%) patients required inotropic support in the emergency department (ED) and 48 (17%) patients were admitted to critical care unit (CCU). 166 (58%) patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and 33 (12%) underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) for biliary decompression. 8 patients underwent index cholecystectomy. Length of stay was 11.5 (range 1-91) days and 30-day mortality of 11%. Multivariate analysis performed showed that an abnormal Glasgow coma score (p=0.017) and malignancy (p\\0.001) predicted 30-day mortality. The use of ED inotropic support predicted CCU admission (p=0034). A positive blood culture (p=0.005), presence of malignancy (p\\0.001), use of ED inotropes (p=0.001), and index cholecystectomy (p=0.008) predicted a longer length of stay. qSOFA (p\\0.001) and TG13 severity grading (p=0.001) were predictive of 30-day mortality. SIRS criteria did not predict 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Reduced consciousness and malignancy predicted 30-day mortality in octogenarian patients with AC. qSOFA and TG13 severity grading system is superior to SIRS criteria in predicting mortality of octogenerians with AC.

Introduction: Management of malignant biliary obstruction not amenable to surgery is usually by means of ERCP or PTHC. However, on occasions, these routes are not accessible and the alternate decompressive technique of percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) has to be adopted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and outcomes of PC in a highly selected series at a tertiary referral center. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients that had undergone PC from 2000 to 2014. Data collected included baseline demographics, comorbidities, details of PC placement and management, etiology of MBO, and post-procedure outcomes. The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated for all patients at the time of PC. Results: Four hundred and eight patients underwent PC placement of which 28 patients including 18 (64%) males and 10 (36%) females, with malignant biliary obstruction. The mean age at the time of PC placement was 63.5\u00b111.7 years of age, and the mean CCI was 8.03\u00b12.82 for all patients. of MBO in all 28 patients was due to pancreatic malignancies (n=14), cholangiocarcinoma (n=6), primary hepatic malignancies (n=3), secondary hepatic tumors (n=4), and ampullary carcinoma (n=1). PC tube complications were reported in 7 (25%) patients. Mean number of tube exchanges was 3.4\u00b12.65. Mean duration from PC tube placement to death was 159\u00b1159.4 days. 14 total deaths were recorded. Conclusion: PC placement appears to be a viable option in MBO in elderly and frail patients. In this cohort, PC may be a potential definitive management to improve quality of life.",

The current dogma revolves around the \"72 hour rule\" advocating early cholecystectomy if within the window, and if beyond 72 hours, conservative treatment and interval operation. In patients beyond the 72 hour window, as well as with multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and other complicating factors, cholecystostomy has become an acceptable treatment as a bridge to interval cholecystectomy.

Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare malignancy characterized by high invasiveness and poor survival. In our institution, all gallbladder specimens are routinely sent to pathology, to rule out GBC. The purpose of our study was to assess the efficacy for routine histopathology of gallbladder specimens after cholecystectomy (CLY) for all gallbladder disease. Methods and Procedures: After obtaining approval from our institutional review board, a retrospective review was conducted on all patients who underwent CLY from June of 2012 to May 2016 were included in the study. The data obtained include gender, age, American Society of Anesthesiologist score (ASA), body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, length of stay (LOS), radiological imaging and pathology results. Independent T and Chi-square tests were performed using IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae 24 software.",

Increased hospital stay was associated with lower albumin level at admission (p=0.0019). A majority (31/60) of recurrent episodes involved stent placement, exchange or removal. 14 patients (58%) had either biliary malignancy, gallbladder or both.

We hypothesized that the assessment of irregular vessels on the gallbladder wall may be useful for detecting subserosal infiltration. We present an initial report on the clinical usefulness of laparoscopic narrow band imaging (NBI) for the intraoperative diagnosis of tumor invasiveness in gallbladder carcinoma. Methods: Thirteen patients with gallbladder cancer were included in this study. Patients with tumors located in the liver bed and those with definitive invasion observed on computed tomography findings were excluded from this study. Gallbladders were observed using NBI and the microvasculature was evaluated. According to previous reports of endoscopic NBI, we defined four findings as positive: vessel dilatation, tortuousness, interruption, and heterogeneity. The NBI findings were compared with postoperative pathological findings. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Oita University.",

The most common management of cholangitis with ductal obstruction due to choledocholithiasis is intravenous hydration, empiric antibiotic therapy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and stone extraction with or without stent placement, followed by a delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We present the case of a patient with blood clot obstruction of a common bile duct (CBD) stent after ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction.

Biliary ultrasound demonstrated multiple gallstones and dilation of the CBD with a distal obstructing calculus. He proceeded to ERCP where biliary cannulation was achieved, sphincterotomy performed, and a large amount of sludge and pus was drained. An 8 mm stone was removed from the CBD by balloon sweep with completion cholangiogram demonstrating no filling defects. A stent was then placed in the CBD with adequate flow. Following the procedure, the patient continued to have increasing hyperbilirubinemia. A repeat ERCP revealed a large blood clot and continued bleeding at the previous sphincterotomy that resolved with epinephrine injection. The former stent was visualized in the proper position, removed with a snare, and found to be fully occluded with blood clots. After retrieval of additional clots, a new stent was placed with adequate return of bile. The patient recovered with resolution of his symptoms and hyperbilirubinemia with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Discussion: Cholangitis is characterized by Charcot's triad of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice due to an ascending bacterial infection of the biliary tree coinciding with obstruction of biliary flow most commonly from gallstones. Cholangiography via ERCP with associated sphincterotomy, stone extraction, and stenting is both diagnostic and therapeutic. While debated by endoscopists, stent placement has shown to reduce recurrent biliary complications, decrease length of hospital stay, and lessen morbidity. Although pancreatitis is the most common cause of hyperbilirubinemia post-ERCP, stent occlusion secondary to stones or blood clots should be considered to effectively treat patients. Proper hemostasis is important in any procedure and close patient follow-up should be performed to prevent further complications.",

CCs occur most frequently in Asian and female populations. CC is associated with biliary lithiasis and considered at risk of malignant transformation. Todani's classification dividing CC into 5 types is the most useful in clinical practice. The current standard treatment is complete cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and cholecystectomy for the extrahepatic disease (Todani type I and IV). In this report we present our experience using a total laparoscopic technique to treat adult patients with CC in 5-year period.

The predominant symptoms were chronic abdominal pain and jaundice. A case of both pancreatitis and cholangitis were also seen. Investigations included ultrasound with MRCP in 6 cases and ERCP in 1 case. The mean operative time was 4 hours and 20 minutes (3 hours 30 minutes to 5 hours range) with mean intraoperative blood loss 85 ml (range 20-200 ml). All the resected specimens showed chronic inflammation. Malignancy was not seen in any patients. The early postoperative complications included bile leakage with intra-abdominal collection in 2 patients, which were managed conservatively (evidenced by clinical status and imaging study), re-operation was not required. The median duration of hospital stay was 8 days (range 6-23 days). There was no perioperative mortality. All patients were followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, late complication were not detected during each visit. Conclusion: In our opinion, laparoscopic cyst excision and hepaticojejunostomy could offer more feasible and safe methods of treatment for CCs in adult patients with potentially less postoperative morbidity, a shortened length of stay and a lower blood loss when compared to the preferred open approach. However, we would need to study this on a larger sample of patients to report the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic approach.",

Although one patient was lost to follow-up, no patient had recurrent biliary colic or other complications arising from the remnant gallbladder. This may be encouraging to surgeons who feel that subtotal cholecystectomy with an infundibular remnant is the safest way to proceed with cholecystectomy in patients with severe inflammation. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the utility and efficiency of ICG as an alternative to routine intraoperative cholangiogram in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Introduction: Common bile duct injury is an uncommon, but serious complication associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Current guidelines state that when used routinely intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) can decrease biliary injury, however it is not routinely used due to increased time of operation, and inaccessibility of equipment. Indocyanine Green (ICG) has been found to be effective for identification of biliary anatomy during cholecystectomy, however has not yet been widely adopted. We aim to assess if ICG is able to overcome the obstacles of IOC, while still effectively assessing biliary anatomy. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in a single institution from January 2014 to September 2017. Elective and emergent cases were included. We stratified patients into ICG and non-ICG groups. Patients who had concomitant procedures performed were excluded. We analyzed patient demographic information, as well as BMI, ASA classification and comorbidities in both groups. Our primary outcome was operation time (skin to skin), and laparotomy conversion rate. Secondary outcomes were effectiveness of ICG in visualizing biliary anatomy, and cost.",

This presents an anatomical challenge to biliary disease requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In gastric bypass patients, traditional ERCP via the mouth in these patients is technically more challenging, requiring a longer endoscope with a reported success rate of less than 70%. A solution is laparoscopic assisted ERCP (LA-ERCP) via gastrostomy. This minimally invasive technique has become increasingly more prevalent and safe. We present our experience with LA-ERCP at our teaching community hospital in a large cohort of patients. Methods and Procedures: Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with a history of prior laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery who underwent LA-ERCP from April 2008 to April 2016. The procedure was performed by two different general surgeons and one gastroenterologist. A pursestring suture and transfacial stay sutures were used to bring the gastric remnant to the abdominal wall. A gastrostomy was then created and accessed by the duodenoscope to perform the ERCP. Biliary sphincterotomy, papillary or biliary dilation, lithotripsy, stent placement, and/or stone removal were performed as indicated. We observed the incidence of postoperative outcomes, including acute pancreatitis, reoperation, post-procedure infection, pain control, hospital re-admission and bile leak. Results: Thirty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Six patients were male and twenty-six were female, with mean ages of 59 (std dev 7) and 53 years (std dev 15), respectively. Indications for LA-ERCP included suspected choledocholithiasis (25/32), cholangitis with choledocholithiasis (2/ 32), acute pancreatitis (2/32), abdominal pain with abnormal LFT (1/32), cholangitis with cholecystitis (1/32), and bile leak (1/32). LA-ERCP was successfully performed in all thirty-two patients. Biliary cannulation, sphincterotomy and stone extraction were performed on 31/32 patients, and one patient underwent sphincterotomy and stent placement for bile leak after recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One patient developed acute pancreatitis with elevated pancreatic enzymes which resolved after conservative treatment. One patient required a second LA-ERCP for stent replacement due to a persistent bile leak. The median length of stay was 2 days (range 1-10 days).",

Patients may be at increased risk for developing trocar site hernia. Case Report: A 35 year old Hispanic female in her 22th week of pregnancy came to the ER with acute right upper quadrant pain. Due to lack of accessibility she had poor prenatal care. She had mildly elevated amylase but normal LFTs and ultrasound showed some gallbladder wall thickening suggestive for acute cholecystitis and no dilated biliary duct. Fetal ultrasound was normal. She was admitted to the hospital and started on antibiotics, obstetrics was consulted. Her amylase peaked at [600 U/L but then normalized and indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy was made. MRCP and ERCP were not performed as it was assumed that the patient had passed a stone. Five mm trocars were placed in the LUQ and the umbilicus and a Teleflex minigrasper between the tow. The uterus was found at the umbilical level. The GB was pulled out and the serosa was incised on both sides and a window was created behind the GB midportion and widened towards infundibulum and fundus. There was GB wall thickening and edema. The critical view was obtained and the cystic artery and duct were clipped and divided. The common bile duct appeared normal and no IOC was done. The specimen was retrieved through the LUQ port site using a 5 mm endobag after dilatation to 1.5 cm due to the presence of two large stones. The port site fascia was closed using a suture passer. The postoperative course was uneventful and both mother and baby were well at the two weeks follow up. Discussion: In case of biliary pancreatitis during pregnancy, LC should be performed and if ultrasound shows a normal biliary system and amylase/lipase normalize, MRCP/ERCP and IOC may be avoidable to protect the baby. LC with two ports is feasible during pregnancy. Removal of the specimen through a lateral abdominal wall site may help prevent an umbilical port site hernia in this patient population.

To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any reported cases of splenic abscess arising after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It is important to remember this disease process for expeditious targeted treatment in future cases. Case Presentation: A 69 year-old female with past medical history significant for cholilithiasis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of abdominal pain for two days. Labs and imaging were obtained which confirmed the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis. ERCP was performed which showed a 1.5 cm stone causing obstruction, with several other smaller filling defects. The stones were removed after sphincterotomy. Post procedurally, the patient underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy on Hospital Day (HD) #5. Post operatively, the patient had persistent leukocytosis peaking at 16.8 thousand on postoperative day (POD) #6.

The decision to use endoloop or sutures for stump closure was made intra-operatively after dividing the gallbladder through the infundibulum. A no.20 sized drain was kept in all the cases. The patients were discharged with drain in situ, and were reviewed on post-operative day 7 during which an ultrasound was done and drain removed if the progress was satisfactory. The intra-operative and post-operative data between the two groups were recorded and analyzed. Results: Endoloop closure was performed in 45 patients and suture closure using 2.0 ethibond was done in 36 patients. Three patients from the sutured group had post operative bile leak among which one patient underwent endobiliary stenting. The other 2 were managed conservatively while the drain had to be retained for 2 weeks. Two patients in the endoloop group were detected to have retained stone in the remnant gallbladder cuff among which one had recurrent cholecystitis requiring laparoscopic completion cholecystectomy. None of the patients had bile duct injury or surgical site infection. Mean post operative stay was 2.5+1.2 days, did not significantly vary between the groups. Suturing needed more surgical expertise and had prolonged operative time than endoloop (68+22 min versus 84+18 min, p=0.04). Conclusion: Suture or loop closure of the remnant gallbladder after subtotal cholecystectomy are equally effective. Suturing the stump may be associated with increased incidence of biliary leak while endoloop may have higher incidence of retained gallstones. The choice between the two may be made intra-operatively based on the surgeon's expertise and preference. Background and Aim: In recent years, due to the spread of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, bile duct injury as its complication has been reported at a certain frequency. Current surgical treatments include 1) suturing and closing the injured part laparoscopically during surgery, 2) transitioning to laparotomy and closing the suture, 3) inserting a tube such as T-tube under the laparotomy, 4) bile duct-intestinal anastomosis under the laparotomy, etc. are taken into consideration. Regardless of which treatment method, it is not a definite ideal treatment. We have developed a bioabsorbable material (caprolactone: lactic acid (50: 50) polymer reinforced with polyglycolic acid fiber and designed to be absorbed in about 8 weeks). At this conference, we would like to talk about the current state and problems of development of minimally invasive therapy for biliary damaged area using bioabsorbable materials we developed. Method: In order to overcome the problem of the current bile duct injury cure method, we have been developed, a) a method of closing a perforation part endoscopically from the luminal side of a bile duct (a covered stent using a bioabsorbable material in the damaged part), b) Develop a method of closing the biliary duct injury under the laparoscope from the outside of the bile duct (adhering the bioabsorbable sheet to the bile duct perforation using a biocompatible adhesive).",

There was a significant difference in age only. The complications were bile duct injury in one case (0.3%) and pneumothorax in two (0.6%). Conclusion: Obesity had no influence of surgical outcomes for performing SILC. Introduction: Recent studies have reported mixed outcomes when comparing surgeon case volume and Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC) outcomes. Formal minimally invasive surgical training (MIST) has been shown to be associated with shorter post-operative length of stay (LOS), but no difference in major adverse events such as bile leak, bile duct injury, intra-abdominal abscess formation, and death. We aim to determine 30-day rates of major adverse events after LC in a university hospital setting, to identify significant associated risk factors, and to determine if MIST or surgeon volume are associated with differences in LOS and major adverse events. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective review of 2,764 cholecystectomies performed over a seven-year period (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) . Characteristics and outcomes were compared using Chi squared or rank sum tests. Multivariable regression modeling was used to determine independent associations with the two main outcomes, major adverse events and LOS. Results: We identified 2,764 adults who underwent LC during the study period, with a median age of 50, and 70% women. About 19% (n=531) of patients had a LOS[1 day and 4.3% (n=120) were re-admitted within the first 30 days after surgery for any reason. Within 30 days of LC, 2.2% (n= 60) of patients suffered from one or more major adverse events. This includes 0.18% (n=5) of patients with bile duct injury, 1.3% (n=35) of patients with bile leak, 0.3% (n=7) of patients with intra-abdominal abscess, and 0.3% (n=9) of patients died for reasons related to their procedure or post-operative recovery. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the patients and procedures with a comparison of the patients with an adverse event versus those without one. In univariate analysis, high annual surgical volume (40+ cases/year) and procedure urgency were found to be significant predictors of adverse events and LOS, however, MIST was not. In multivariable analysis, controlling for significant univariate predictors, urgent or emergent cases were associated with a 3-fold increase in odds of an adverse event (OR=3. Introduction: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an extremely common procedure in the United States, with over 700,000 cases performed annually. Despite the procedure's overall safety, there has been some evidence that tobacco use is associated with increased risk of wound infection after LC. This retrospective chart review sought to examine whether tobacco use is associated with increased complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy within a high-volume healthcare system. Methods: After IRB approval, 900 of approximately 3,000 cholecystectomies performed within one four-hospital system between 2009 and 2015 were randomly selected, and patient charts were retrospectively reviewed. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative data were collected, including all complications within 90 days. Tobacco use cohorts were defined as follows: never, former (any historical tobacco use), and current (active tobacco use within 1 year of surgery) per the ACS NSQIP Surgical Risk guidelines. Following preliminary data analysis, multivariable logistic regression models were generated to identify whether tobacco use was predictive of outcomes of interest.",

There were 17 surgical site infections, one wound dehiscence, one port site hernia, three common bile duct injuries, and 44 medical complications requiring prolonged hospitalization or readmission within 90 days. Current tobacco users were significantly more likely to undergo urgent surgery (following emergency admission or direct admission to the hospital) than former or nonsmokers. However, there was no difference between cohorts for prolonged duration of surgery, conversion to an open procedure, surgical site infection, wound dehiscence or hernia, common bile duct injury, or other medical complication. There was no significant difference between cohorts when all postoperative complications were pooled. Conclusions: There does not appear to be a significant difference in 90-day surgical outcomes or complications in active tobacco users vs. former or non-users. Although studies in other surgical settings have indicated a possible reduction in complications if patients abstained from smoking prior to surgery, this may not be beneficial in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Moreover, as current tobacco use appears to be associated with higher rates of urgent surgery, these patients may not be able to stop smoking prior to an elective procedure. Prospective studies to further clarify whether there is any benefit towards tobacco cessation prior to LC may be valuable. 9, [150, [ 150 respectively (0-20) , cyfra 211 were 8.11, 9.22, 6.36 respectively (0-3.5) .

The procedure has been accepted and modified in many medical centers worldwide. But reports about the laparoscopic ALPPS were rare. This study aimed to report a totally ALPPS combined with microwave ablation for a patient with huge HCC and confirm the feasibility of laparoscopic ALPPS. Methods: A 51-year-old man had complained of 1-year history of right upper abdominal pain, and the syndrome was worsened in recent month. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a 15911 cm solid mass in right lobe of liver with non-uniform and unclear boundary, the right posterior branch of the portal vein was invaded. In addition, a small lesion was simultaneous found in left lateral lobe of liver. The tumor was evaluated as unresectable due to the FLR was only 355 ml (25%). We decided to perform the laparoscopic ALPPS procedure. First stage including microwave ablation of the lesion in left lobe, cholecystectomy, ligation of the portal vein and transection of liver parenchyma.

He endorsed a history of similar pain several times in the past. His abdomen was soft, nontender, and without Murphy sign. Laboratory evaluation revealed total bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 195 U/L, AST 835 U/L, ALT 800 U/L, and no leukocytosis. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed cholelithiasis, distal choledocholithiasis, intra-and extra-hepatic ductal dilation, and a 3.8 centimeter left liver hemangioma. He was transferred for management of choledocholithiasis, and an abdominal ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis, without gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, and a 7.7 millimeter common bile duct without choledocholithiasis. He was taken to the operating room for a one-step ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Upon laparoscopy, dense adhesions to the gallbladder were found. After initially attempting to obtain the critical view of safety, we then embarked on the retrograde \"top down\" dissection. This isolated a spherical structure measuring 2.492.2 centimeters. Two very thin tubular structures were identified, clipped, and transected after we found they were too small to place a cholangiocatheter. The common bile duct appeared to be pulled anteriorly by surrounding inflammation, though this was later found to be the proximal segment of gallbladder. The intra-operative ERCP identified a remnant gallbladder with cholelithiasis and no extravasation of contrast. Given the unusual anatomy, we completed the operation, ordered a post-operative CT liver and MRCP, and consulted a hepatopancreatobiliary surgeon. A small remnant gallbladder was identified on CT liver, though not on MRCP. Completion laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram and ultrasound was performed on hospital day 4. This hourglass gallbladder variant likely occurred secondary to chronic fibrosis from cholecystitis, leading to a proximal and distal gallbladder lumen. In anatomic uncertainty, the \"top down\" dissection, intraoperative cholangiography, CT liver, and expert consultation are safe methods to avoid iatrogenic injury. Introduction: Endoscopic entero-enteral bypass could change our approach to small bowel obstruction in patients with prohibitively high operative risk. Magnetic compression anastomoses have been well-vetted in animal studies, but remain infrequent in humans. Isolated cases of successful use in humans include treatment of biliary strictures and esophageal atresia. While endoscopic gastro-enteric magnetic anastomoses have been described, the associated multicenter cohort study was terminated due to serious adverse events. Since then, the technology has evolved and recently our own institution reported results of the first in-human trial of Magnetic Compression Anastomosis (Magnamosis), deployed through an open approach. Here we present the first case of endoscopic delivery of the Magnamosis device and the successful creation of an enteroenteral anastomosis for chronic small bowel obstruction in a patient with prohibitively high operative risk.",

Occasionally chronic cholecystitis can lead to a small contracted gallbladder. This diagnosis can be misleading as it may represent congenital agenesis of the gallbladder [2] . A 28-year-old female with a past history of pancreatitis presented with a three day history of right upper quadrant pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Upon exam she exhibited tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Her leukocyte count and liver function tests were within normal limits. Ultrasound revealed a poorly visualized, contracted gallbladder without stones and a dilated common bile duct (CBD). Cholescintigraphy revealed non visualization of the gallbladder after two hours, which was suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Decision was made to proceed with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The abdomen was entered by an open Hasson technique and standard trocar placement for a cholecystectomy was performed. On initial inspection, the gallbladder was not readily visible. A structure appearing to be the CBD was present and was mobilized circumferentially (Fig. 1) . A 19 gauge butterfly cannula was utilized and multiple cholangiographic images were obtained (Fig. 2 ). No cystic duct or gallbladder was identified which was suggestive of congenital agenesis of the gallbladder. The patient did well postoperatively, and was discharged home on postoperative day two. The patient's symptoms resolved and she continues to be pain free one month postoperatively. Congenital agenesis of the gall bladder is a rare disorder. A high index of suspicion is required especially in the setting of a small contracted gall bladder. If preoperative imaging is inconclusive then diagnostic laparoscopy should be the next step. Cholangiogram should be performed routinely to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out an ectopic gall bladder. Conversion to open does not offer any distinct advantage, and laparotomy should be avoided if possible given its associated morbidity. There are many reports upper abdominal major arterial aneurysms. However, an aneurysm of left inferior phrenic artery had never been reported. A 48-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B viral infection was referred to department of surgery for treatment of aneurysm of left inferior phrenic artery. She underwent trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma three times, previously. On 20 months after last TACE, 7 mm sized highly enhancing nodular lesion of gastric fundus was found on follow-up abdomenpelvis computed tomography (A-P CT). One year later, the size of this lesion increased to 18 mm, and an aneurysm was diagnosed. She underwent angiography and attempted embolization with an aneurysm of the left inferior phrenic artery, but access failed. We performed a laparoscopic vessel ligation. She recovered with no complication and discharged on the 3th postoperative day. S170 Surg Endosc (2018) 32:S130-S359",

            "text": "Background: Mesenteric panniculitis (MP) is a rare, benign and chronic fibrosing inflammatory disease that affects the adipose tissue of the mesentery of the small bowel and colon. The specific etiology is unknown and no clear information about the incidence. The diagnosis is suggested by CT and is usually confirmed by surgical biopsy. Treatment is based on some selected drugs. Surgical resection is sometimes attempted for definitive therapy, although the surgical approach is often limited. We reported a case of the MP diagnosed with CT and surgical biopsy by laparoscopic approach. Case Report: 50-year-old woman with 5 months history of chronic abdominal pain, mainly localized in the sub-epigastrium, intermittent and mild. She had anorexia but no weight loss or change in bowel habits. No history of medical illness or surgery. The physical examination was unremarkable, except for palpation of ill-defined mass about 5 cm at mid-abdomen, firm, smooth surface with mild tenderness. The laboratory profile and tumor marker were normal. CT of the abdomen, which showed focal heterogeneous enhancement of the mesenteric fat with stranding (8.794.8910 cm) with multiple internal subcentimeter LNs in the supraumbilical area, which was probably inflammatory in origin and suggestive of MP. 18F-FDG PET/CT showed faint FDG uptake in multiple mesenteric LNs. The patient was subsequently underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy. Intra-operative finding showed a fat-like surface of yellowish mass at mesentery of jejunal segment, incisional biopsy was performed laparoscopically. The histology showed adipose tissue with areas of fat necrosis, fibrosis, foamy macrophages infiltration and predominant chronic inflammation, no evidence of malignancy. IHC studies (including CD68, S-100, CD3 and CD20) were performed and the result was compatible with reactive process. Treatment was started with 40 mg prednisone once daily and planned for follow-up with repeated CT scan. Discussion: MP involves the small bowel mesentery in over 90% of cases. The diagnosis is made by 3 pathologic findings: fibrosis, chronic inflammation and fatty infiltration. The differential diagnosis is broad and has been associated with malignancies such as lymphoma, well-differentiated liposarcoma and melanoma. The imaging appearance varies depending on the predominant tissue component. A definitive diagnosis is biopsy but open biopsy is not always necessary. No data of laparoscopic biopsy, which has been reported previously. Treatment has been reserved for symptomatic cases with a variety of drugs. Our case was started on oral corticosteroid treatment and waited for responsive evaluation. Background: Laparoscopic appendectomy is the gold standard for treatment of acute appendicitis. Stapled closure of the appendiceal stump is often performed and has been shown to have several advantages. Few prior cases have been reported demonstrating complications from free staples left within the abdominal cavity after the laparoscopic stapler has been fired. Case Report: A previously healthy 29 year old female initially underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis during which the appendix and mesoappendix were divided using laparoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) staplers. Her initial postoperative recovery was uncomplicated and she was discharged home the same day.",

Her abdomen was distended and mildly tender but not peritoneal. She was afebrile but was found to have a leukocytosis of 13.2. CT demonstrated twisted loops of dilated small bowel in the right lower quadrant with two transition points, suggestive of internal hernia with closed loop bowel obstruction. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed through the three prior appendectomy incisions. An adhesion was noted between the Veil of Treves and the mesentery of a more proximal loop of ileum caused by a solitary free closed staple, remote from the staple lines, resulting in an internal hernia containing several loops of ileum ( Fig. 1 ). The hernia was reduced, and the small bowel was noted to have early ischemic discoloration. The adhesion was lysed by removing the staple from both structures to prevent recurrence. Through the remainder of the procedure, the compromised loops of bowel began to peristalse and the color normalized. The procedure was concluded without resection. The patient recovered on a surgical floor and was discharged home on postoperative day one. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal staplers are commonly used secondary to ease of use and low complication rate. It is not uncommon to leave free staples in the abdomen during laparoscopy as retrieval can often be more difficult and time consuming. Our case is only the second in the literature reporting an internal hernia with closed loop bowel obstruction as a complication of retained staple. Choosing the most appropriate size staple load, to reduce the number of extra staples after the fire, and removing as many free staples as possible can prevent potentially devastating complications.",

Literature describes the incidence of PS to be only 0.15-6.4% of all pulmonary malformations. As PS is most frequently diagnosed during childhood, the occurrence of diagnosis during adulthood is estimated to be less than 3 per 10,000 adults. Two types (intra-and extralobar) are described, with intralobar sequestration most common and contained within the normal visceral pleura. Both types have aberrant systemic arterial blood supply, most frequently from the thoracic aorta. Likewise, both types are nonfunctioning lung tissue, as there is no direct communication with the bronchopulmonary tree. The most common presentation is pneumonia, and often patients will have had recurrent symptoms before diagnosis. It is rare to present with hemoptysis, which is understood to be secondary to elevated capillary pressure within the sequestration and then communication through the pores of Kohn. While endovascular embolization of the aberrant pulmonary artery has been described as a safe alterative for surgical intervention, the subjects of these studies have primarily been children and long-term outcomes are unknown. The definitive treatment of PS continues to be surgical intervention. The surgeon should strive to leave as much normal lung parenchyma as possible. Video-assisted thoracoscopic resection is well tolerated by patients when compared to thoracotomy. However, it is vital for the surgeon to be aware of the potential risk of life-threatening hemorrhage secondary to the sequestration having systemic blood supply that must be controlled and ligated.

Abdominal ultrasound showed an irregular cyst, without solid projections and without signs of flow in Doppler, measuring 20911920 cm. Investigation continued with CT scan that showed a large homogeneous cystic lesion with no septum in the abdominopelvic region, possibly mesenteric, measuring 20.5910.5924 cm. A laparoscopic approach for resection of the cyst was then performed. The surgery was performed with a patient in the dorsal decubitus, using three trocars: one in the umbilical region (11-mm) for the camera, and where the pneumoperitoneum was created by the Hasson open technique under direct vision; and another two located in the epigastrium (5-mm) and in the right upper quadrant (3-mm) . In addition to the mesenteric cyst, a simple cyst in the right ovary and a solid nodule with a lipomatous characteristic of approximately 3 cm in the abdominal cavity were visualized. Total resection of the mesenteric cyst with periprancreatic fibrous tissue was performed. The cyst was punctured and its contents fully aspirated. Resection of the right ovarian cyst was also performed. At the end of the procedure the mesenteric and ovarian cysts, the nodule, part of the omentum, and the peripancreatic tissue were removed through the 11-mm trocar at the umbilicus. Patient had no further complications, being discharged four days after the procedure. Histopathologic result showed a serous cyst in the right ovary, serous cyst in peripancreatic mesentery with chronic inflammatory process and signs of calcification; no signs of malignancy were observed in any specimen.

The patient refused blood transfusion as her religious beliefs, Jehovah's Witness, preclude her from taking blood products. As part of her work up, endoscopy was performed and revealed a large, approximatelly 494 cm, prolapsed, ulcerated, nodular lesion with active bleeding in the cardia of the stomach. This was temporized but the friable tissue, with no single identifiable lesion for clip placement, left the patient at high risk for re-bleeding. She was taken to the operating room and Laparoscopic partial gastrectomy with intraoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy were succefully perfomed, with minimall blood loss and no intra operative complications. Patient was discharged on post op day 3. We present the case of a 46-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity with an initial BMI of 44.7, who underwent an elective laparoscopic single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S). Postoperatively he developed an anastomotic leak at the duodeno-ileal anastomosis that would not resolve despite reoperation. He was then converted to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Postoperative imaging failed to reveal any signs of anastomotic leak and the patient was discharged tolerating an oral diet. He returned to the emergency department 11 days later with a 69392 cm sub-hepatic collection arising from the duodenal stump from the surgical conversion. Interventional radiology percutaneously drained the collection and found a connection between the cavity and the duodenum. Using this connection, a percutaneous decompressive duodenostomy drain was successfully inserted into the duodenum using a guidewire through the abscess cavity along with an extra-enteric drain placed within this cavity. The collection was obliterated and the duodenal leak was controlled successfully with percutaneous drainage, bowel rest with parenteral nutrition and broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The patient was reintroduced to a bariatric clear diet after a week of bowel rest and the abscess drain was then discontinued during the same hospital admission. The patient was discharged with the percutaneous duodenostomy tube which was removed in clinic 34 days later, after the patient tolerated capping trials and imaging failed to reveal any further collections, oral contrast extravasation or distal obstruction.",

The patient worked outdoors in Arizona and was otherwise healthy with a family history of malignancy and blood disorders. Fever, leukocytosis and ascites on computed tomography scan prompted a diagnostic laparoscopy which revealed peritoneal granulomas positive for Coccidioides. The patient was treated outpatient with Fluconazole. Discussion: Since 1939 this is the 38th reported case of peritoneal coccidioidomycosis to our knowledge. The patient described in this case report was an otherwise healthy 36-year-old male; this is incongruent with many of the previously recorded cases which involved disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients. The patient's family history of malignancy and blood disorders suggests a potential underlying genetic predisposition that could account for this abdominal presentation. Possible mutations include genes coding for the interleukin-12 \u03b21 receptor and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 which have been implicated in increased coccidioidomycosis susceptibility. Peritoneal infection presents a unique challenge in diagnosis. In these cases coccidioidomycosis may not be suspected due to nonspecific symptoms and imaging, the infrequency of this extra-pulmonary manifestation and clinical characteristics that mimic the presentation of tuberculosis and malignancy. Abdominal infections have been misdiagnosed as appendicular abscesses, iliopsoas abscesses, adnexal abscesses and pancreatic masses. Consequently, the diagnosis of peritoneal coccidioidomycosis is often made after laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen and histopathology, as it was in this case report.",

Imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) is a safe and effective technique to detect biliary anatomy in open, laparoscopic and robotic surgery. Several studies report detecting aberrant biliary anatomy with the use of ICG in laparoscopic cholecystectomy with high success rates. By identifying the cystic duct-common hepatic duct confluence before dissecting Calot's triangle, ICG allows surgeons to perform \"virtual\" cholangiography at the start of procedures to identify either normal anatomy or possible anatomic variants. It is clear that ICG use is an effective tool to achieve the critical view of safety. However, no reports have suggested ICG cholangiography as the last operative step in cholecystectomy to identify hidden biliary anomalies and avoid postoperative bile leak complications. Case Report: We report a novel use of ICG cholangiography in visualizing anomalous biliary anatomy prior to closing, thus avoiding potential bile duct leakage. In our case, ICG cholangiography was used to fluoresce the common hepatic duct, common bile duct and cystic duct.",

            "text": "Discussion: The use of ICG in this context after the completion of the cholecystectomy facilitated the identification of a small hepatocystic or aberrant duct, which would have likely leaked bile sometime in the postoperative period. Based on our experience, we recommend one additional routine near infrared viewing to identify small structures or potential leaks at the completion of cholecystectomy. Improved visualization of the extrahepatic biliary anatomy by ICG has the potential to translate into improved clinical outcomes. Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are uncommon fibroblastic mesenchymal neoplasms that display a wide range of histologic behaviors. These tumors, which are estimated to account for 2% of all soft tissue neoplasms, typically follow a benign clinical course. However, it is estimated that 10-30% of SFTs are malignant and demonstrate aggressive behavior with local recurrence and metastasis up to several years after surgical resection. We report a case of SFT arising from the stomach, which is an exceptionally rare finding and has been reported only six times in the literature. Additionally, this tumor was associated with dedifferentiation into undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. To our knowledge, there are no documented cases of a malignant SFT arising from the stomach to demonstrate dedifferentiation into an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. A 68-year-old male presented to the emergency department with vague complaints of right-sided flank pain. The patient had a history of nephrolithiasis and underwent a CT abdomen. This scan revealed a large heterogeneous mass in the left upper quadrant. The patient underwent endoscopic ultrasonography with fine needle aspiration of the mass, which stained strongly for CD34. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was the favored diagnosis as it is by far the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the stomach, especially CD34 positive spindle cell neoplasm. Accordingly, the patient began treatment with imatinib; however, after four weeks of therapy, there was no significant radiologic regression. A second biopsy was performed and the specimen was sent for STAT6 immunohistochemistry, which revealed diffuse strong nuclear positivity. A diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor was provided. Surgical resection of the tumor was performed, which measured 17914910.5 cm. The patient was to undergo surveillance imaging every 3 to 6 months post-operatively. Surveillance scan showed solitary metastatic disease in the left lateral segment of the liver. He underwent left lateral segmentectomy with an uneventful recovery. Our case was complicated by diagnostic dilemma with GIST, highlighting the challenges of diagnosing and characterizing SFTs. Dedifferentiation, or the abrupt transition from a classic SFT into a high-grade sarcoma, is a particularly concerning finding in our case, as it is associated with a worse prognosis than classic malignant SFT. The STAT6 marker by immunohistochemistry is very specific for SFT and may have aided in the diagnosis earlier. Therefore, it is imperative to keep solitary fibrous tumor, albeit exceedingly rare, in the differential diagnosis of mesenchymal neoplasms of the stomach. Appendiceal diverticulitits is an uncommon pathology that can clinically mimic acute appendicitis. Some radiographic distinctions have been reported, but final pathologic examination of the surgical specimen is required to confirm the diagnosis. Symptoms are often more mild, which can lead to a delayed diagnosis, and increases the risk of severe complications such as perforation.",

Associated symptoms included nausea and vomiting, and decreased appetite; she denied fevers or diarrhea. The patient had no significant past medical history, and surgical history was significant for a total nephrectomy for living donor kidney transplant to her mother. On physical exam she was tender in the right lower quadrant with rebound and a positive Rosving's sign. All laboratory results were unremarkable, and she was hemodynamically stable. CT scan was performed and demonstrated a dilated fluid filled appendix with surrounding inflammatory change without abscess or free intra-peritoneal air. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital, made npo, started on IV antibiotics, and was taken to the operating room where she underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy. Post-operatively, her hospital course was unremarkable. Pathology revealed acute suppurative appendicitis secondary to an acutely inflamed appendiceal diverticula, consistent with a final diagnosis of acute appendiceal diverticulitis. Appendiceal diverticulitis should be considered in patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Although some consider appendiceal diverticulitis a variant of acute appendicitis, it is important to distinguish between the two diagnoses. Appendiceal diverticulitis has a higher rate of complications, including perforation, and is associated with a higher risk of neoplasm, particularly mucinous adenomas and carcinoid tumors. Appendectomy should be performed in all cases in order to obtain appropriate pathological examination and rule out coexistent neoplasms. Laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe and appropriate approach to treatment of appendiceal diverticulitis. Upper GI endoscopy and biopsy showed a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in the stomach. A videolaparoscopic partial gastrectomy was then proposed. The surgery was performed with the patient in the right lateral decubitus. Two 3-mm minilaparoscopic trocars, a 5-mm conventional trocar for an ultrasonic instrument and a 10-mm trocar in the umbilical region for the camera were used. Pneumoperitoneum was created using the Hasson open technique under direct vision. Trans-operatory endoscopy was perfomed to identify the tumor easily. Initially, the ultrasonic device released the large omentum, and, then, the tumor was resected in the body of the stomach. The gastric wall was manually sutured with a 2-0 Vicryl, and the tumor was removed in an endobag through the 10-mm incision in the umbilicus. The surgery was uneventful, with a total time of 72 minutes. The patient had no further complications, being discharged two days after the procedure with good clinical conditions. Histopathological result showed a free margins GIST. Conclusion: The minimally invasive approach proved to be safe and effective for this procedure. The known advantages of video-surgery such as less trauma, better visualization, increased dexterity, better esthetics, and less postoperative recovery time were confirmed. The Upper GI endoscopy contributed to improve the safety and efficacy of the procedure, allowing a more precise resection of the GIST, as well as the intragastric review of the suture line at the end of the surgery.

            "text": "Background: Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare post-operative complication, which has been associated with a wide range of precipitating factors. Most commonly described associated conditions include; cirrhosis, bacteremia, myeloproliferative disorders and hypercoagulable states. PVT most frequently occurs as a complication after hepatobiliary surgery, and although possible, very few cases have been documented occurring after laparoscopic surgery of the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, we describe a case of PVT in a patient who underwent elective laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and was treated successfully at our center. Case: A 39 year-old female with past medical history of depression, migraines and endometriosis underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic right hemicolectomy at our facility, for recurrent rightsided diverticulitis. She had suffered 4 previous episodes of diverticulitis and desired definitive surgical treatment. Her hospital course was uneventful and she was discharged to home on postoperative day 2. On post-operative day 9, she presented to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain, back pain and nausea. Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis revealed PVT. She was initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin. Hematology was consulted for hypercoagulable workup. Further investigation revealed that she had a family history of a brother who had had a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, with negative hypercoagulable workup. She had also previously been taking leuprolide and conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone for her endometriosis. She was ultimately found to have a heterozygous prothrombin G20210A gene mutation. Her anticoagulation was bridged to Coumadin and she was discharged home. She has recovered as expected, without any further complications. Discussion: Although more common in patients with cirrhosis after hepatobiliary surgery, PVT is a rare complication that can occur after virtually all types laparoscopic surgeries, including elective right hemicolectomy. Patients may be completely asymptomatic, or present with a broad spectrum of symptoms including; severe abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Physicians should be aware of this possible complication, since early diagnosis and treatment is imperative to prevent life-threatening complications, such as intestinal ischemia and perforation. A detailed medical and family history is imperative, and all patients with post-operative PVT should undergo complete hypercoagulability workup. This is a case of a 37 year old male with a previous history of a redo-hiatal hernia 5 years prior who presented with two episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with no identifiable source noted on both endoscopy and angiography. During his second admission, initial hemoglobin was 5.5 g/dL and endoscopy performed showed massive amount of blood in the stomach. Continuous oozing was seen originating in the fundus area but no clear source could be identified. Empiric epinephrine was injected to the area but failed to achieve hemostasis. Angiography was also negative. Repeat endoscopy performed showed no active bleeding, however, distention of the wrap into the gastric cavity was observed. The patient re-bled and was taken to the operating room emergently after failed attempt at endoscopic control. The patient underwent proximal gastrectomy after intra-operative gastrostomy and exploration was unable to identify a bleeding source. The patient was left with an open abdomen and in discontinuity while resuscitation was performed in the surgical intensive care unit. He subsequently underwent a Roux-en-Y reconstruction and gastrostomy tube placement via the distal gastric remnant. Upper gastrointestinal series performed demonstrated absence of leak, and the patient was started on a liquid diet supplemented with tube feeding. His recovery was uneventful and he was discharged home in stable condition. Pathology revealed gastric ischemia at the base of the wrap making it impossible to visualize through endoscopy. On reviewing the literature, gastric ulcers and ischemia have been previously described. Incidence was up to 3% and their onset of presentation ranged from the early post-operative period up to 5 years. Most were located in the lesser curvature. The exact pathophysiology for its occurrence is not completely understood. Factors hypothesized include technical aspect of the fundoplication causing inappropriate tension, vessel disruption and ischemia, and injury to the vagus nerve affecting gastric emptying which was thought to increase gastrin secretion. Treatment includes medical management with proton pump inhibitors; however, few cases describe antrectomy with inclusion of the bleeding ulcer. Our case presents failed medical and endoscopic management. We recommend take down of the fundoplication in hemodynamically stable patients to completely evaluate the gastric mucosa, identify, and address the source of bleeding. Otherwise emergent cases will require staged gastrectomy including the wrap followed by Roux-en-Y reconstruction.",

Here we first report an acalculous cholecystitis associated with a PAD-related CBD obstruction. Case: The patient was a 60-year-old female with a past surgical history of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy who presented at the emergency room with upper abdominal pain and vomiting for one day, associated with leukocytosis and left shift. Serum total bilirubin raised up to 6.1 mg/dL on hospital day (HD) 3. CT, ultrasound, and MRCP images confirmed a distended, wall-thickening gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid, and a significantly dilated CBD at 1.2 cm of diameter ( Fig. 1) , without cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis. ERCP was unable to be completed due to the post-gastrectomy anatomy and the failure in cannulation into the ampulla which embedded in a large foodimpacted PAD (Fig. 2 ). On HD5, the patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy and an intra-operative cholangiogram which confirmed a mildly inflamed edematous gallbladder, and a 3.893.8 cm 2 large PAD with a narrow neck that was distorting the distal CBD (Fig. 3 ). Since the patient's bilirubin level had been improving, we decided to only do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively an anatomic variation of the cystic artery encircling the cystic duct ( Fig. 4 ) was also identified. Postoperatively the patient recovered well during the thereafter inpatient course and at the postoperative 3-week outpatient follow-up. The pathology of the excised gallbladder confirmed cholecystitis without cholelithiasis. Discussion: Lemmel's syndrome is defined, in the absence of cholelithiasis or other detectable obstacle, by obstructive jaundice due to PAD. Since Lemmel described this duodenal-diverticulum-obstructive jaundice in 1934, there still have been very few cases reported or investigated. To date there is no report describing the association of acalculous cholecystitis with Lemmel's syndrome. This patient's mild acalculous cholecystitis probably attributed to the biliary obstruction and consequent gallbladder hydrops. Her symptoms could be from either acalculous cholecystitis or intermittently worsening biliary obstruction. In this case, the contribution of the anatomic variation of the cystic artery is unclear. In the future, if this patient's symptoms recur, the treatment plans for her will be sphincterotomy, removal of the impacted food in the PAD, or diverticulectomy.",

Case Report: A 48 years old female patient presented with complaints of severe abdominal pain since 5 days. There was no history of associated nausea or vomiting, fever or altered in bowel habits. On examination patient had tenderness and guarding localized to the right iliac fossa. Blood investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers. Ultrasound whole abdomen and Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) were normal. Patient was managed conservatively but in view of persistence of symptoms a triple puncture diagnostic laparoscopy was performed on day 3 of admission. Omental inflammation with soapy appendix was found and appendicectomy was performed. On further assessment a foreign body was also found in the ileum which was removed and identified as a fish bone. Patient had a satisfactory post operative recovery and was discharged in stable condition. Discussion: Acute abdomen due to fish bone ingestion is not a very common occurrence. Unfortunately the history is often non-specific and these people can be misdiagnosed with acute appendicitis & other pathologies. CT scans can be useful to aid diagnostics. It is however not fully sensitive in detecting complications arising from fishbone ingestion. Conclusion: Any patient with acute abdomen, with non-specific history and normal imaging may still benefit from a diagnostic laparoscopy. Discussion: This patient presented with a bowel obstruction, partial cecal necrosis and neuroendocrine carcinoma. Literature suggests that cecal necrosis in the majority of cases is caused by a vascular event, occlusive or non-occlusive. The patient had atherosclerosis and an underlying malignancy which can be associated with prothrombotic states and contributes to an overall risk of thrombosis. The cecum can sustain ischemic ischemic injury in the presence of severe or prolonged hypotension. Most frequent causes being decompensated heart failure, hemorrhage, arrhythmia or severe dehydration, only 1 of which was present in this patient. The midgut neuroendocrine tumor is generally located in the terminal ileum, as a fibrotic submucosal tumor 1 cm or less. Mesenteric metastases are often larger than the primary tumor and associated with fibrosis which may entrap loops of the small intestine and cause bowel obstruction. This may eventually encase the mesenteric vessels with resulting venous stasis and ischemia in segments of the intestine as seen in this patient. Conclusion: Cecal necrosis is a rare entity, but its incidence increases with age. Isolated cecal necrosis may manifest as a CT-negative appendicitis or a small bowel obstruction in the absence of past surgical history. S178 Surg Endosc (2018) Laparoscopic transection of the Falciform and triangular Ligament successfully released the entrapped loop with successful reperfusion by the end of the surgery.

Introduction: Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the initial and most studied weight reduction procedures and remains the gold standard for comparison in bariatric surgery clinical outcomes. Although RYGB is an effective procedure for weight loss, it has been less popular over last several years because of increased morbidity compared to the more utilized vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). Early complications of RYGB include bleeding, perforation, or leakage. Late complications include internal hernias, small bowel obstruction, anastomotic stenosis, marginal ulcers, and gastrogastric fistulas. Case Report: A 50-year old female with a past medical history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, GERD, peptic ulcer disease, cholelithiasis, liver dysfunction with ascites, asthma, and a past surgical history of RYGB (11 years ago) presented to our institution with acute on chronic abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, inability to eat and maintain hydration, and an additional weight loss of about 100 lbs. over the last year. In addition, the patient was a chronic opioid and NSAID user, had an extensive smoking history, and had not followed with her surgeon for 11 years. At the time of presentation, the patient weighed 82 lbs (BMI: 13.2), had normal vital signs, and appeared cachectic. An upper gastrointestinal study followed by an upper endoscopic examination demonstrated complete obliteration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis and revealed a 2-cm long gastrogastric fistula originating from the distal end of the gastric pouch to the lesser curvature of the excluded stomach. After conservative measures were initiated to hydrate and metabolically stabilize the patient, the decision was made to proceed with diagnostic laparoscopy and surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube to the gastric remnant. The patient was discharged after tolerating a full liquid diet and gastrostomy tube feedings, for plan of future revision of gastrojejunostomy when optimal nutritional status is achieved.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Late complications of RYGB occur at a rate of 15-20%. Major risk factors for anastomotic complications include non-compliance, smoking, and opiate and NSAID abuse. Though abdominal pain, anastomotic stenosis, marginal ulcers, and fistulas are relatively common late complications of RYGB, complete obliteration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis has not been well described in the literature. This case demonstrates the importance of long term follow up post RYGB for early diagnosis of late complications and brings attention to this rare, but possible sequele that can arise in patients after RYGB. Contrast radiograms and upper endoscopic photographs will be presented. Introduction: Retroperitoneal sarcoma represents approximately 12-15% of all sarcomas and less than 0.5% of all neoplasia. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy still do not represent valid therapeutic alternatives; therefore complete surgical resection is the only potential curative treatment modality for retroperitoneal sarcomas. The ability of complete resection of a retroperitoneal sarcoma with tumor grading remains the most important predictor of local recurrence and disease-specific survival. In a patient with a large fibrosarcoma and associated hypoglycemia, assays for insulin-like activity (ILA) were found to be high in the extract of tumor tissue, while insulin was not detected in significant concentration neither in the same extract nor in his serum. Laparoscopic surgery represents an alternative technique for radical resection of such tumors as a minimally invasive rather than traditional surgery. Only few cases were reported in the literature. Introduction: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a frequently performed bariatric procedure, of which internal hernia (IH) is a known complication. We discuss a rare finding of occult gastric remnant perforation as a result of an obstructed IH in a post bypass patient. Methods: We present a case report of a single bariatric surgeon's experience at a tertiary care hospital. Literature review of PUBMED confirms the unique presentation and operative findings in our patient, as few similar cases have been published. A 59-year-old male s/p RYGB 12 years ago presented to the ED with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and a leukocytosis of 24,100. BMI was 31.7; weight was 254 lbs. Workup included an abdominal ultrasound showing gallbladder distention without signs of cholecystitis. Liver function tests were normal. Further imaging included a CT scan, remarkable for a paraesophageal hernia (PEH) containing the gastric pouch, and an elevated left hemidiaphragm. The scan showed no evidence of IH or bowel obstruction. An upper GI series was additionally obtained, which was also negative for small bowel obstruction. Due to unclear etiology for this patient's symptoms or source of leukocytosis, diagnostic laparoscopy was planned.",

IH was reduced and closed without bowel resection. Cholecystectomy was completed. Subsequent inspection of the diaphragmatic hiatus revealed uncomplicated herniation of the gastric pouch. In attempts to dissect the left diaphragmatic crus, a large pocket of purulent material was encountered below the left diaphragm in the region of the remnant stomach fundus. Methylene blue test and intraoperative endoscopy did not demonstrate any connection to gastric pouch. The purulence was attributed to an occult remnant stomach perforation related to distal obstructed IH. A drain was left in the abscess and the PEH was not surgically addressed. Patient was discharged on postoperative day 5. He has not suffered any further complications or recurrent complaints. Conclusion: Gastric perforation following RYGB is an uncommon complication resulting from IH. This diagnosis was missed by preoperative imaging and was only found after thorough laparoscopic investigation. Surgeons should maintain a high clinical suspicion of IH in post RYGB patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal symptoms, fever, and leukocytosis, even in the absence of confirmatory diagnostic testing. Threshold for operative exploration in this clinical setting should remain low.",

            "text": "Alejandro Garza, MD, Robert Alleyn, MD, Jose Almeda, MD, Ricardo Martinez, MD; UTRGV Obesity is an epidemic condition worldwide carrying significant morbidity and mortality. Surgical therapy is the only proven effective method to sustain weight loss. Among the different surgical procedures gastric bypass is the most effective. During this surgery, most of the stomach is excluded from the upper gastrointestinal tract which makes future evaluation of the same very challenging. This could potentially lead to delay in diagnosis of any pathology in the bypass stomach. Gastric Cancer is the 14th most common cause of cancer and cause of cancer death in the United States. We present a case report of a patient who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and went on to developed adenocarcinoma in the gastric remnant 28 year after her surgery. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, extended antrectomy, subtotal gastrectomy including the gastro-colic ligament, and incidental appendectomy. Pathology showed grade 4 undifferentiated adenocarcinoma that penetrated the visceral peritoneum with clear margins. There was angiolymphatic invasion and perineural invasion along with metastatic carcinoma in 5 out of 6 lymph nodes. Introduction: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic transmural inflammatory vasculitis that affects medium-sized arteries. Inflammation of the vessel wall and intimal proliferation creates luminal narrowing which can lead to stenosis and insufficiency. The same inflammatory process causes disruption of the elastic lamina leading to aneurysm formation and possible spontaneous rupture with life-threatening bleeding. Multifocal segments of stenosis and aneurysm formation are characteristically identified as a \"rosary sign\" or \"beads on a string\". Unlike other vasculitides, PAN does not involve small arteries or veins, and is not associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. We present the case of a 66 year old female with a significant intra-abdominal bleed that was explored and repaired primarily. She was subsequently found on angiogram and postmortem pathology to have findings consistent with PAN. Case Presentation: 66 year old female who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain followed by hemorrhagic shock and found to have a ruptured left hepatic artery aneurysm during exploratory laparotomy. This aneurysm was suture ligated with a successful outcome. A mesenteric arteriogram was performed the following day and demonstrated lesions consistent with PAN including aneurysms of the left gastric branches, right and left hepatic arteries, and beaded appearance of the iliac artery. However, 2 days after hospital discharge she developed massive pulmonary embolism from which she did not recover. Postmortem examination confirmed rupture of the left hepatic artery aneurysm in addition to gross anatomical and histological findings consistent with PAN. Discussion: Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic inflammatory vasculitis that causes intimal proliferation and elastic lamina disruption. This multifocal disruption of the vessel results in aneurysm formation alternating with stenosis creating a characteristic \"rosary sign\" on imaging. Spontaneous rupture of these aneurysms is rare and almost always fatal due to life-threatening hemorrhage. With acutely ruptured aneurysms, prompt diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation, and hemostasis through transarterial embolization or surgery is paramount for patient survival. While acute rupture of an aneurysm as the result of PAN is exceedingly rare, it must be considered as a differential diagnosis in the setting of acute abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability. In a patient known to have a medical history of PAN and aneurysm formation, routine monitoring and disease progression should be followed. Introduction: 300,000 surgeries are done annually in the US for small bowel obstruction, which is most commonly caused by intraabdominal adhesions, malignancy, and hernias. 0.2 to 5.8% of small bowel obstructions are due to paraduodenal hernias. Paraduodenal hernias carry a 50% lifetime risk of incarceration with a mortality of 20 to 50%. Case Report: The patient is a 78 year old male who presented with severe upper abdominal pain for one day. He was passing flatus and had had a bowel movement the previous day. On examination, the patient was tender over the upper abdomen. Computed tomography (CT) scan with IV contrast showed a mesenteric swirl sign. The decision was made to perform diagnostic laparoscopy with possible small bowel resection. Intraoperatively, a mesenteric defect was noted posterior and to the right of the duodenum, through which bowel was herniating. The herniated bowel and its mesentery were edematous. The defect was sutured closed, taking seromuscular and mesenteric bites through the stomach, jejunum, and mesentery. The patient had an uneventful recovery postoperatively and was discharged on postoperative day 2. He returned on postoperative day 28 with periumbilical pain which resolved with conservative management. He was followed up 6 weeks postoperatively and was doing well. Discussion: Paraduodenal hernias are the most common internal hernias. They are seen more often in males. They are caused by failure of the counterclockwise rotation of the prearterial segment of the embryonic midgut in weeks 2 to 12 of embryonic development. Paraduodenal hernias usually present with chronic intermittent abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting. They may present acutely with symptoms of bowel obstruction. Peritoneal signs are often not appreciated due to retroperitoneal position of the hernia. CT scan of the abdomen often shows clustering of bowel loops, which cannot be displaced on repositioning the patient. If imaging is equivocal, diagnostic laparoscopy may be undertaken. Surgical correction consists of reducing the bowel, resecting nonviable segments, and either closing the defect or opening the sac laterally into the general peritoneal cavity. In summary, paraduodenal hernias are a rare cause of bowel obstruction and as such present a challenge in diagnosis and early intervention. ",

The clinical presentation may be acute inflammatory with or without appendicitis or it may be an incidental finding in an uninflamed appendix. The congenital type is rare and it has all the bowel wall layers. It most frequently represents as pseudo diverticulum which lacks the muscularis layer. The pathogenesis of appendiceal diverticula is not completely elucidated. Its symptoms are similar to and often misdiagnosed for that early acute or chronic appendicitis. While appendectomy is curative for both entities, it is important to distinguish diverticulum of the appendix from appendicitis as it is four times more likely to perforate and may be a sign of an underlying neoplasm. We reported a very rare giant pseudo diverticulum of the appendix in a 69-year-old male presenting with chronic abdominal discomfort for months. Abdominal X-ray showed abnormal gaseous finding. Physical exam was significant for a soft rubbery mass in the periumbilical region. Blood work revealed slight elevation of C-reactive protein. Preoperative CT and MRI showed a 9-centimeter-large cavity composed of thin wall, located at the tip of the appendix with peri appendicular fat stranding. In the concern of pending obstructive symptom and chronic abdominal pain, we decided to perform the resection laparoscopic. The soft mass arose from the tip of the appendix. There were dense adhesions between the appendix, mesentery, and sigmoid colon. After adhesiohedlysis, laparoscopic appendectomy was performed with EndoGIA. The specimen was extracted through a small incision without spillage. Hospital course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on post-operative day 4. The pathological finding was consistent with a pseudo diverticulum of the appendix which lacked muscularis layer and the inner wall of the cavity was lined with a scattered cubital epithelial layer in the continuity with the appendiceal mucosal membrane. Here we report a successful laparoscopic resection of an extremely rare giant chronic pseudo diverticulum of the appendix.",

Physical exam was only pertinent for abdominal pain on light palpation, guarding and moderate distress. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a lipomatous mass causing complete obstruction of the sigmoid colon with intussusception. This was managed with laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. The patient had an uncomplicated post-operative period and was discharged on post-operative day 2. Pathology of the lipomatous mass confirmed a benign lipoma. Discussion: Intussusception is rarely encountered in clinical practice in adults and constitutes 5% of all cases. Lipoma induced sigmoid intussusception with complete obstruction is rare. Symptoms can be non-specific as in this case. This case report highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of an intussusception in adult patients. CT scan is the gold standard for diagnosis and often shows a \"target sign\". Other imaging techniques like ultrasound have shown adequate results but remain less effective than CT scan. The treatment in adults is not a reduction by enema like in pediatrics but rather resection of the lead point. This can be appropriately done with a laparoscopic technique in most cases. Conclusion: Colonic intussusception is rare. Surgery is the only treatment for an intussusception in adults since the lead point needs to be removed, and can be attempted safely with a laparoscopic approach.",

Discussion: Epiphrenic diverticula in the presence of achalasia has an occurrence rate of 25%. Large diverticula ([5 cm), are even more rare with only a handful of case reports in the literature. Historically, thoracotomy or, more recently, thoracoscopic approaches are required for resection. However, thoracic approaches are associated with a 20% increase in morbidity, namely due to staple line leak and the resulting pulmonary complications. Only a single case report exists on our review of the literature that demonstrates successful trans-hiatal laparoscopic resection without post-operative complications of a diverticulum of this size. The shortest documented length of hospital stay postoperatively for similar cases is 4 days, while the average is 7-10 days or longer for those with complications. Our patient was able to go home on post-operative day 1 after a normal UGI and was tolerating a soft diet. Not only does this case show that a large epiphrenic diverticulm can be successfully resected via the trans-abdominal laparoscopic approach, this case makes the argument that patients undergoing any minimally-invasive epiphrenic diverticulectomy and myotomy, with or without fundoplication, may be successfully managed with early post-operative contrast studies and dietary advancement, thus decreasing their length of hospitalization and overall cost of treatment.",

Few cases of laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer with SIT have been reported. We report a case of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection performed for gastric cancer in a patient with SIT. Case Description: An 80-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for treatment of gastric cancer that was diagnosed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at a local clinic after she experienced anemia and nausea. EGD identified an irregularly shaped gastric ulcer located at the anterior side of the lesser curvature of the antrum. A biopsy revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. She was then diagnosed with SIT by chest radiography and abdominal computed tomography (CT). The abdominal CT showed that all organs were inversely positioned and that the wall of the antrum had thickened; it also showed the lymph nodes in the lesser curvature of the stomach, without distant metastasis or an abnormal course of vascularity. The patient was clinically diagnosed with T3N1M0 stage IIIA gastric cancer according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma. A laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection in accordance with the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines as well as a Roux-en-Y anastomosis due to an esophageal hiatal hernia were performed. The surgery was safely and successfully performed, although it required more time than usual because the inverted anatomic structures were repeatedly examined during the surgery. The postoperative course was positive, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without any complications. The final stage of this case was pT1bN0M0 stage IA. Currently, the patient is doing well without recurrent gastric cancer. Conclusion: Gastric cancer with SIT is an extremely rare occurrence. We experienced a case of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection performed for gastric cancer in a patient with SIT. We simulated the operation for SIT by viewing left-right reversed ordinary surgical videos. The abdominal CT angiography with a three-dimensional reconstruction helped reveal any variation and confirmed the structures and locations of vessels before the surgery. The operation could safely be performed following the standardized surgical technique by reversing the surgeon standing position and trocar position. Sternum or chest wall resection is performed for a variety of conditions such as primary and secondary tumors of the chest wall or the sternum. Sternum reconstruction has been a complex problem in the past due to intraoperative technical difficulties, surgical complications, and respiratory failure caused by the chest wall instability and paradoxical respiratory movements. Advances in the fields of surgery and anesthesia result in more aggressive resections. Nowadays neither the size nor the position of the chest wall defect limits surgical management, because resection and reconstruction are performed in a single operation that provides immediate chest wall stability. Chest wall resection involves resection of the ribs, sternum, costal cartilages and the accompanying soft tissues and the reconstruction strategy depends on the site and extent of the resected chest wall defect.",

Two tumours were at the gastroduodenal junction, two from the appendix, small intestine and pancreas, each, and one each from the rectum and gall bladder. This is in contrast to literature that shows that neuroendocrine tumours of the GIT most commonly arise from the appendix and small bowel, followed by the rectum, stomach and duodenum. Two of these tumours were functional. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining for Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin. Grading was done using WHO criteria that takes into account the mitotic count, Ki 67 Index and necrosis. 21 of our cases were Grade I. Further, Immunohistochemistry for E cadherin showed that absence of expression correlated with more aggressive clinical behavior. 18 out of twenty five patients were operable at presentation and standard resections depending on the organ of origin with adjuvant therapies were given as required. 5 could only be given palliative care. The 2 functional tumours were treated with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues following uptake studies. Conclusion: As neuroendocrine tumours are relatively rare, information about them is not as abundant as with other malignancies. Absence of E Cadherin expression is associated with more aggressive disease.",

Since the introduction of histamine-2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors, these procedures have dwindled significantly. However, there are still instances where patients require surgical intervention for peptic ulcer disease. Perforation is one of the indications for surgery. The surgical options to treat a perforated peptic ulcer are numerous. One of the most common options is a Graham patch. We are presenting a case of a patient with a perforated ulcer that did not have available omentum for the repair. Methods and Procedures: Recently, a 64-year-old female with a past history of an open total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy presented as an outpatient with chronic lower abdominal pain. She underwent a work-up and imaging that did not reveal any pathology. At diagnostic laparoscopy, she had diffuse lower abdominal adhesions, which were lysed. She was discharged on the same day, but presented to the Emergency Department two days later with severe abdominal pain and fevers. The work-up revealed tachycardia, diffuse abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs, leukocytosis and a large amount of free air on imaging. She was emergently brought to the Operating Room for a diagnostic laparoscopy. During laparoscopic exploration, the lower abdominal cavity appeared normal for a recent lysis of adhesions. Attention was turned to the upper cavity to find the pathology. Bile-stained free fluid and peri-gastric exudates were identified, but no perforation was visualized. Intra-operative endoscopy revealed the site of perforation in the antrum on the lesser curvature. A biopsy was performed and the decision was made to perform a Graham patch. However, the omentum was already densely involved with the lower abdominal cavity from the enterolysis. Due to the close proximity of the falciform ligament, it was mobilized laparoscopically and the pedicle was used as a Graham patch. The patient recovered without any additional issues. The biopsy was reported as a chronic gastric ulcer.",

Perforated ulcers can be managed laparoscopically and Graham patches are a common choice for repair. However, the lack of the omentum for a proper pedicle flap can pose a problem in some patients.

It is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Having a nonspecific presentation may contribute to a delay in diagnosis and results in poor outcomes. Treatment is challenging, yet early surgical intervention is the most important prognostic factor. Case Presentation: We present a case of a thirty-two-year-old male with a long medical history of dysphagia due to benign oesophagal stricture. He presented with acute onset of epigastric pain after severe emesis. Based on Computed Tomography scan, he was diagnosed with Boerhaave's syndrome. Presenting with signs of shock, mandated immediate Surgical exploration. For which he was taken for Laparoscopic primary repair with uneventful postoperative recovery.",

            "text": "The Golden period of the first 24 hours of insult still applies for cases of oesophagal perforation. The rarity of these cases makes a comparison between the various treatment methods difficult. Our data support that the use of Laparoscopic operative intervention with primary repair as the mainstay of treatment for the management of oesophageal perforation. Lipomas of the gastrointestinal tract are rare benign soft tissue tumors that are often discovered incidentally. These lesions are often asymptomatic, but have occasionally been reported to have clinical significance as will be described in this case report. A 40 year old male initially presented to his primary care physician's office with a three week history of vague intermittent abdominal pain. His pain was located in the mid epigastrium and was associated with mild nausea. Past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia and a right-sided goiter, and he denied any previous surgeries. Outpatient work up revealed a microcytic anemia, intermittent melena and hemoccult positive stools. The patient was referred to hematology and gastroenterology. Endoscopies revealed gastritis, and small internal and external hemorrhoids. He underwent an outpatient CT scan which demonstrated a 6.092.3 cm mass within the lumen of the jejunum causing long segment non-obstucting intussusception. Subsequently, the patient was referred to surgery and underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy. At the time of surgery, an approximately twelve centimeter segment of proximal jejunum was identified intussuscepting into a distal limb. This segment was attempted to be reduced laparoscopically, however there was significant mesentery within in the intussusceptum and the segment could not be safely reduced. Therefore, the section of bowel was delivered through a small periumbilical incision. The intussusceptum was then able to be manually reduced from the intussusception. At this point a large mass was palpated inside the lumen of the jejunum. A small bowel side to side, functional end to end resection and anastomosis was preformed. The bowel was returned to the abdomen and the abdomen was re-insufflated. The remainder of the small bowel was run and no additional lesions were identified. Final pathology revealed a 5.593.693.5 cm submucosal partially obstructing lipoma with ulceration at the tip. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged home on the second post operative day. This case report describes a submucosal jejunal lipoma that was acting as a lead point for intermittent non-obstructing small bowel intussusception, while simultaneously causing a microcytic anemia due to ulceration at the tip of the lipoma. Laparoscopic assisted reduction and small bowel resection is a safe and effective treatment for gastrointestinal tract lipomas that are unable to removed endoscopically. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an alternative to laparotomy for open gastrostomy tube placement to provide enteral nutrition for those who are unable to pass nutrition orally. Despite being less invasive, the procedure is not without its complications, one of which includes the formation of a gastrocolocutaneous fistula. The case describes a 90 year old female who presented with a PEG placed 6 months prior with reports of leakage of tube feeds from the gastrostomy site. As there was concern for possible ileus or obstruction, an upper GI series was completed which seemed to indicate dislodgement of the g-tube. The g-tube was replaced and a follow-up gastrograffin study was repeated which now indicated that the g-tube was within the lumen of the colon. Soon thereafter fecal matter was noted to be draining around the g-tube site; however, patient was without clinical signs of peritonitis. The patient was managed non-surgically as she was a poor surgical candidate with multiple prohibitive co-morbidities. The g-tube was removed bedside by cutting it flush at the skin level with the anticipation that the remainder of the tube would be excreted with bowel movements. The decision was then made to attempt closure of the gastric fistula endoscopically which was accomplished with hemoclips. A follow up upper GI study 72 hours later showed no extravasation of contrast through the gastric fistula. The colocutaneous fistula had self-resolved over the next couple days as well. Placement of the PEG tube through the transverse colon can present with varying ill effects including diarrhea, pneumoperitoneum, peritonitis, gram negative pulmonary infection or feculent vomiting with the formation of a gastrocutaneous fistula. Treatment historically for a gastrocolocutaneous fistula has been exploration and excision of the fistula tract with resection of the involved colonic segment. However, there currently is no gold standard for the management of, and really ranges from conservative management to surgical and is dependent on the presenting symptoms. If the PEG becomes dislodged with resultant spillage from the colon with resultant peritonitis, surgical exploration is needed with removal of the g-tube and repair of the stomach and colon. On the other hand, non-surgical management has been suggested in management of a well-established fistula. Fistula closure may be spontaneous; however, can be inhibited due to delayed gastric emptying or leakage of gastric secretions through the fistula. Endoscopic clipping of the fistula tract employing the hemoclips is a treatment option. Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS) is a rare etiology of abdominal pain caused by narrowing of the celiac artery at its origin by the median arcuate ligament with relative hypoperfusion downstream. Patients suffer from post-prandial abdominal pain, abdominal pain associated with exercise, nausea, and unintentional weight loss. Diagnosis is historically made by demonstrating elevated celiac artery velocities and respiratory variation on dynamic vascular studies. Standard of care for MALS patients is laparoscopic celiac artery dissection with release of the median arcuate ligament. At our institution, we have encountered fourteen patients (eleven female, three male) diagnosed by elevated peak velocity in the celiac artery by duplex ultrasound in conjunction with CT angiogram, MR angiogram, Arteriogram, or multiple modalities. All but one patient had multiple diagnostic imaging modalities, with the most common being CT angiogram; eight patients had invasive imaging. The mean age at presentation was 58.7 years in men and 47.8 years in women. On average, male patients presented with a longer duration of symptoms, 17.7 years (range 3-30 years), as compared to women, 3.3 years (range 1-15 years). Symptoms were fairly consistent between genders and included nausea, emesis, abnormal bowel habits, early satiety, post-prandial pain, and weight loss. All male patients reported at least two symptoms, most commonly nausea and post-prandial pain. In female patients, 82% reported having three or more symptoms. Notably, post-prandial pain was universal among men and women, while weight loss was exclusive to female patients as reported by 73%. Pre-operative peak velocities were recorded in all but one patient, with mean values more elevated in female patients as opposed to male patients, 156 cm/s versus 345 cm/s. Post-operative duplexes were obtained in seven patients; pooled data show a mean change of negative 210 cm/s for an average of 112 cm/s after decompression. In all cases, the celiac artery trifurcation was visualized and noted to have a distinct change in artery caliber after division of the ligament. In total, 79% of patients reported significant improvement with return to normal diet and healthy weight gain post-operatively. Of the three without complete resolution, two were diagnosed with motility disorders and one was lost to follow-up. Our experience demonstrates that laparoscopic release of the median arcuate ligament in patients with significant flow limitation of the celiac artery on dynamic and anatomic imaging can be a successful treatment option for patients with recalcitrant pain and gastrointestinal dysfunction with no alternative diagnosis.",

The most common cause of abdominal adhesions is previous surgery in the area as well as radiation, infection and frequently occurring with unknown etiology. These bands occur among abdominal organs, commonly the small bowel, and can lead to obstruction or remain asymptomatic, akin to the patient discussed here. Congenital abdominal adhesions are rare and have received little attention in research and field of study. The patient described in this case is a 25-year-old female with a past medical history of morbid obesity, BMI of 45, hypertension and no past abdominal surgical procedures. The patient presented in August 2017 for bariatric surgical consultation and was ultimately taken for an attempted laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Upon entering the abdomen, significant adhesions were encountered and an additional attending was called to assist in identifying the stomach. The splenic flexure was found to be plastered to the diaphragm and the descending and transverse colon were adhered to the anterior surface of the stomach. Additionally, small bowel adhesions encased the area between the right and left hepatic lobes as well as the caudate lobe. After extensive enterolysis, the pylorus remained the only identifiable portion of the stomach. The patient also demonstrated significant hepatomegaly and a wedge resection was performed. The amount of adhesion and matting of the small and large bowel obscured the view of the stomach and the procedure was deemed too dangerous and terminated. This case represents the uncommon scenario in which an abdomen with no prior surgical history presents with extensive, obscuring adhesions. One such recent study describes the influence of cytokines and proinflammatory states as contributors to obstruction and malrotation in children, but this patient demonstrated no significant history. Further investigation is needed to determine potential etiologies of symptomatic and non-symptomatic congenital adhesions among bariatric patients who fail conservative treatment. Today the patient is doing well and the surgical team will attempt to complete the procedure in the coming months.",

Most often, they are asymptomatic, and found incidentally during radiographic workup for an unrelated problem. Torsion can cause a splenule to not only become symptomatic, but also confound the results of usual diagnostic studies. Case Description: A 61-year-old female patient with history of uncomplicated hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, spinal surgery, and partial left nephrectomy, presented to the hospital with a two-week history of intermittent left upper quadrant abdominal pain. She denied any similar episodes in the past, or any associated symptoms. Further investigation with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed an acute inflammatory process in the left upper quadrant in same location as some colonic diverticulosis, as well as a 4.5 cm soft tissue mass. This indeterminate soft tissue mass was described as having decreased attenuation compared with the spleen. Differential diagnosis for this mass included malignancy, an atypical splenule, or an infectious/inflammatory mass. An MRI was recommended for further evaluation, but did not reveal any additional significant findings. Nuclear medicine liver/spleen scintigraphy was performed, which showed no focal activity associated with the indeterminate left upper quadrant mass, therefore making it unlikely to reflect a splenule, and making malignancy the diagnosis of exclusion. Following a period of observation with analgesia, intravenous antibiotics, and bowel rest, her abdominal pain did not resolve, and the decision was made to proceed with operative exploration. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed an approximately 5 cm spherical mass in the left upper quadrant located just below the inferior aspect of the spleen. The superior aspect of the mass gave rise to a vascular pedicle, which upon tracing, seemed to originate from the splenic hilum. This pedicle was easily ligated, and the mass removed. Pathology revealed an extensive infarcted hemorrhagic nodule with organizing thrombus and attached thrombosed artery, consistent with an infarcted splenule due to torsion along its own axis. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course.",

Scintigraphy, which is normally the gold standard for diagnosing and localizing accessory splenic tissue, was in this case unrevealing, due to inability of the tracer to traverse the torsed vascular pedicle. Operative exploration was both diagnostic and therapeutic. patients which was treated with antibiotics suggested by culture and sensitivity report and local wound care. One patient died due to sepsis at presentation. Conclusion: Chikungunya virus was found circulating in rodents in Pakistan as early as 1983. Duodenal ulcer perforation which is a common surgical emergency in our part of the world usually presents with pinpoint perforation in ant wall of first part of duodenum unlike in already diagnosed cases of Chikungunya Disease where a slit like duodenal perforation is noted in the anterior wall of first part of duodenum. Literature and consensus relate this perforation with the excessive use of Nsaids due to usual presentation of arthritis in Chikungunya disease but the unusual presentation is still to be answered. Introduction: Bouveret's Syndrome is a rare form of gallstone ileus in which an impaction of a gallstone in the duodenum results in a gastric outlet obstruction. Gallstone ileus accounts for approximately 2-3% of all cases of small bowel obstruction. The terminal ileum is the most common location for a calculus to cause obstruction followed by the proximal ileum, jejunum and duodenum/stomach respectively. Open and laparoscopic surgery has previously been the mainstay of treatment for Bouveret's Syndrome, however with the advent of new endoscopic techniques and instruments there has been increasing success in endoscopic management. This case report looks at a patient with a gastric outlet obstruction from a gallstone, and discusses the current literature regarding diagnosis and management. Case: 69 year old male presented with several day history of epigastric abdominal pain and multiple episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. He had previously been diagnosed with cholelithiasis, however had refused surgery at that time. On admission the patient was found to have a leukocytosis of 13.5. An ultrasound was performed in which the images were limited due to pneumobilia. A subsequent CT scan revealed pneumobilia, and a large 2 cm gallstone impacted in the first portion of the duodenum causing a gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent failed endoscopic attempts at removal and ultimately required a laparotomy, enerotomy with stone extraction. Discussion: Bouveret's syndrome is a rare variant of gallstone ileus. With newer endoscopic techniques and electrohydraulic lithotripsy, there has been increasing success with endoscopic retrieval of the impacted gallstones. There is some controversy in regards to the need for definitive operative management. Stone extraction, without cholecystectomy and fistula repair, has been shown to have less postoperative complications as well as lower mortality rates compared to when a cholecystectomy and fistula repair has been performed. Total mesorectal excision (TME) with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) is standard treatment for rectal cancer, which has resulted in a decrease in local recurrence. However, NACRT has shown no significant overall survival and some adverse effects mainly caused by radiation therapy. Recently, the usefulness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been reported. We retrospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of the neoadjuvant mFOLFOXIRI compared with NACRT followed by laparoscopic surgery. A total of 76 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for lower rectal cancer (clinical Stage: II or III) from July 2014 to February 2017 in our department were retrospectively evaluated. 40 patients underwent NAC, and 36 patients underwent NACRT. The following data were collected: pathological complete response (pCR), histological grade, down staging, radial margin (RM) and postoperative complications. Histological grade was defined as follows: tumor cell necrosis or degeneration is present in less than one third of the tumor area (Grade 1a), between one and two thirds (Grade 1b), more than two thirds but viable cells remain (Grade 2), and complete response (Grade 3). These two groups were demographically comparable. Down staging did not differ between the two groups. Histological grade (?Grade 1b) and pCR were significantly higher in the NACRT than in the NAC group (p\\0.05). RM had no significant difference in both groups, but tended to be able to secure negative RM in the NAC group (95% vs. 83. 3%, p=0.06 Aims: Increasing evidence suggest that CME may improve overall and disease free survival in colon cancer. Our aims were to investigate the safety and efficacy of single incision laparoscopic CME colectomy (SILCC) compared to multiport CME laparoscopic colectomy (MPCLC) providing the first meta-analytical evidence. Methods: PUBMED, Scopus and Cochrane library were searched. Studies comparing the SILCC to MPCLC in adults with colon adenocarcinoma were included. The studies were critically appraised using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with x2 and I2. The symmetry of funnel plots was examined for publication bias. Results: One randomized and four case control trials were included (540 SILCC Vs 609 SL Introduction: Obesity has been associated with increased morbidity following total proctocolectomies with ilealpouch anal anastomosis (TPC-IPAA). However, the incremental added risk of increasing obesity class is not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the additional morbidity of increasing obesity class for TPC-IPAA. Methods: After ethics board approval, the ACS-NSQIP database (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) was accessed to identify patients who underwent elective TPC-IPAA. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 ) was classified as normal (18. 5-24.9) , overweight (25.0-29.9), obesity class-I (30-34.9), obesity class-II (35-39.9) and obesity class-III (\u226540). Primary outcomes were overall surgical site infection (SSI) and organ-space infection (OSI). Secondary outcomes were 30-day major morbidity and length of hospital stay (LOS Aim: In curatively intended resection of sigmoid and rectal cancer, many surgeons prefer to perform ligation of the root of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), high tie, because of oncological reasons. However, ligation of the IMA has been known to decrease blood flow to the anastomosis. There are few reports of patients undergoing the reduced port laparoscopic approach (RPS) including single-incision laparoscopic approach (SILS) even among those undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection around the IMA with preservation of the left colic artery (LCA). Our objective was to evaluate the quality of this procedure regarding application of RPS for the treatment of sigmoid and rectal cancer.",

            "text": "Methods: The feasibility of this procedure was evaluated in 61 consecutive cases of RPS for sigmoid and rectal cancer. A Lap protector (LP) was inserted through a 2.5 cm transumbilical incision, and an EZ-access was mounted to LP and three 5-mm ports were placed. Almost all procedures were performed with standard laparoscopic instruments using a flexible scope (SILS). A 12 mm port was inserted in right lower quadrant mainly in rectal cancer surgery (SILS +1). Our method involves peeling off the vascular sheath from the IMA and dissection of the LN around the IMA together with the sheath. Results: Lymph nodes around the IMA were dissected with preservation of the LCA in 26 cases (group A). The IMA was ligated at its root in 35 cases (high tie, group B). In group A, 11 patients were treated with SILS and 15 patients were treated with SILS+1. In group B, 15 patients were treated with SILS and 20 patients were treated with SILS+1. Median operative time was 187.7, and 154.8 min for group A, and B, respectively. The operative time was significantly longer in group A. Estimated blood loss was 13.7 and 13.0 g, and mean numbers of harvested LN were 21.7, and 23.8. None of the other operative results of groups A and B were different statistically. In this series, there was only one anastomotic leakage in group B. Conclusion: Our method allows equivalent laparoscopic lymph node dissection to the high tie technique. The operative time tends to be longer, however this procedure has a possibility to reduce an anastomotic leakage. Introduction: the routine mobilization of the left colonic flexure in colorectal surgery is still a matter of debate. We present our surgical approach with data. This technique may increases the surgical expertise/confidence when the surgical maneuver is necessary. Up to 40% of all splenectomies are for surgery-related injuries;80% of those splenic injuries are treated by splenectomy. The iatrogenic splenic injury rate during colorectal surgery is 0.96%. Iatrogenic splenic injuries create: increased risk of mortality/morbidity, extended operative time/patient in-hospital stay and increased healthcare costs. Risk factors for iatrogenic splenic injury are: advanced age, adhesions, underlying pathology. Obesity is not a risk factor. It is debated if the left colonic flexure mobilization is a risk factor for splenic injury. The ligament over-traction is the most frequent damage mechanism. The most dangerous surgical manuever is the spleno-colic ligament surgical dissection. Moreover, laparoscopy descreases by almost 3,5 times the splenic injury risk. Some surgeons are reluctant to routinely take down the splenic flexure. Materials and Procedures: 129 robotic left colonic/rectal cases with routine splenic flexure mobilization technique have been performed: left colectomy (n=74), rectal surgery (n=45), transverse-colectomy (n=6) and pancolectomy (n =4). Conversion rate 1,6%, EBL\\100 ml,1 postop-leak (0.8%) and 0% iatrogenic splenic injuries.",

The dissection should be closer to the colon rather than to the spleen. In our experience the routine mobilization of the splenic flexure may have some advantages: a) Better (without tension) distal anastomosis formation; b) Better perfusion of the proxiaml stump; c) Wider oncological dissection; d) No need of going back to the flexure when the proximal stump is too short; e) mastering a surgical manuver useful in other procedures (e.g. distal pancreasectomy). The theoretical drawbacks of routine splenic flexure mobilization can be:a) longer operative time, which is on average increased by 35 minutes; b) Risk of splenic injuries, in our experience, no splenic injuries have been registered.",

Introduction: The robotic stapler with the EndoWrist\u2122 technology (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) includes a larger range of motion and articulation compared to the laparoscopic device, and may provide some benefits in difficult areas like the pelvis. To date, few studies have been published on the application of robotic endowristed stapling. We present our preliminary experience using the robotic stapler in low anterior rectal resection (LARR) with total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer. Methods and Procedures: Between March 2016 and September 2017, 24 patients underwent elective robotic LARR with TME and primary colorectal anastomosis within the ERAS program. Patient demographic, intra-operative data and post-operative outcomes were compared between the EndoWrist\u2122 45 robotic stapler group (RS group) and the laparoscopic stapler group (LS group).",

Even if our case series is pretty small, fewer stapler fires were required in the RSG compared to LSG.

Further high quality studies are required to confirm these findings. Background and Objectives: The present study was aimed at investigating the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic ultra-low anterior resection (L-ULAR) with total mesorectal excision (TME) and transanal specimen extraction for rectal cancer located at lower one-third rectum, and specifically understanding the oncological outcome of the operation. Patients and Method: A prospective designed database of a consecutive series of patients undergoing laparoscopic ultra-low anterior resection for rectal malignancy with various tumornode-metastasis (TNM) classifications from 1991 to 2012 at the Texas Endosurgery Institute was analyzed. In this study ultra-low anterior resection is defined as low anterior resection for the malignant lesion at distal 1/3 of rectum.",

The operating time for the surgery was 169.7 \u00b1 31.1 minutes, and estimated blood loss during the procedure was 104.5 \u00b1 72.1 ml. The length of the lesion from the anal verge measured with intraoperative colonoscopy ranged from 3.5 cm to 6.9 cm, and shortest distance of colorectal anastomosis from the anal verge is 1 cm. Since diverting ileostomy was routinely installed after L-ULAR, none was found to have anastomotic leakage, however 3 patients developed anal stenosis within 6-month follow-up. Therefore the overall rate of postoperative complication is 5.9%. Moreover 4 patients were reported to have local recurrence in 2-year followup with the rate of 7.8%. Conclusions: L-ULAR is safe and effective procedure for the rectal cancer at distal 1/3 rectum with comparable local recurrence and postoperative complication rates, thereby suggesting L-ULAR can be considered as a procedure of choice for rectal cancer at very low location in the rectum. For rectal cancer, however, local full-thickness excisions are fraught with high local recurrence rates -even if limited to early and best selected lesions. This corroborated observation is likely caused by a combination of missed nodal disease and direct implantation of tumor cells into the mesorectum, which upstages even early T1 lesions to at least a T3 lesion. The treatment of choice for invasive adenocarcinoma consists of an oncological total mesorectal resection, possibly with other modalities. Rectal tumors of uncertain behavior can present a treatment dilemma between over-treatment vs under-treatment. Concept: If the nature of a lesion is not certain or if contradictory results have been obtained, we propose a superficial local excision as a mucosal excisional biopsy to establish the diagnosis while avoiding interference with subsequent definitive treatment modalities by preserving the integrity of the external rectal wall and mesorectum. A benign final pathology concludes the treatment, whereas a detection of invasive cancer will be managed with a subsequent oncological resection.",

Introduction: It has been hypothesized that the structural and functional changes that develop in the defunctioned segment of bowel may contribute to the development of postoperative ileus (POI) after loop ileostomy closure (LIC). As such, longer intersurgery interval between ileostomy creation and LIC may increase POI. Methods and Procedures: After institutional review board approval, all patients who underwent LIC at a single institution between 2007-2017 were identified. The primary endpoint, primary POI, was defined as either a) being kept nil-per-os on or after postoperative day 3 for symptoms of nausea/vomiting, distension, and/or obstipation or b) having a nasogastric tube (NGT) inserted, without postoperative obstruction or sepsis. Secondary endpoints included length of hospital stay (LOS) and non-POI related morbidity. Patients who left the operating room with a NGT, had a planned laparotomy with a concomitant procedure at the time of LIC, had a total proctocolectomy as their index operation, or had secondary POI, were excluded. Patients were then divided into two groups based on timing from the index operation to LIC (\\6 months vs. Objective: Fecal incontinence can be a debilitating problem significantly diminishing productivity and quality of life. Sacral neuromodulation has emerged as a first line surgical option treatment in patients with fecal incontinence. Though its efficacy has been rigorously evaluated in adult populations there is scant data available for its use in the pediatric pateints with fecal incontinence. This case study discusses the management of fecal incontinence in a pediatric patient with a history of Hirschsprung's disease utilizing sacral nerve stimulation. Methods: Our patient is a 15-year-old female with a history of Hirshsprung's diagnosed in infancy and treated surgically with coloanal pull through at the age of 1 who presented with complaints of fecal incontinence. The patient was wearing pads daily, noting frequent uncontrolled bowel movements as well as having frequent missed days of school due to these symptoms. Despite maximal medical management and pelvic floor physical therapy the patient continued to have 3-10 episodes of fecal incontinence daily. A CT scan with rectal contrast was used to establish her postoperative anatomy. Anal manometry showed low rest/squeeze pressures, absent resting anal inhibitory reflex, and abnormal sensation. Furthermore, during balloon expulsion testing the patient failed to pass device. The patient was deemed a candidate for Stage 1 testing with sacral nerve neuromodulation. During follow-up, the patient was noted to have resolution of her episodes of fecal incontinence and the second stage was completed. The patient continues to note 100% continence and dramatic improvement in her quality of life. Conclusion: In this patient with a history of severe fecal incontinence due to Hirschsprung's disease, sacral neuromodulation has had a significant impact on her quality of life. Post-operatively she continues to have marked improvement in her symptoms with 4-5 bowel movements a day with no recurrence of fecal incontinence. The use of sacral neuromodulation is a promising treatment for fecal incontinence in the pediatric population. Future research investigating the longterm efficacy of this treatment modality in the pediatric population is needed. Cases of bowel obstruction caused by colorectal cancer recurrence and progression were excluded. 9 surgical cases (0.48%) were considered to be early bowel obstruction and 15 (0.81%) were classified as late bowel obstruction. Left hemicolectomy (n=4, 3.03%) was a significantly more frequent procedure in early bowel obstruction, and abdominoperineal resection (n=5, 4.20%) was significantly more common in late bowel obstruction (p\\0.05). Both early and late bowel obstruction included adhesive small bowel obstruction (n=19), internal hernia (n=3), and strangulation obstruction (n=2). Internal hernia (n=3) and strangulation obstruction (n=2) occurred after left hemicolectomy and abdominoperineal resection, respectively. There is no apparent relationship between surgical procedures and adhesion regions (abdominal wall, intestinal tract, and pelvic cavity). The incidence rate of postoperative small bowel obstruction remained low, and laparoscopic colectomy had been safely performed. However, countermeasures are needed because of the high frequency of both early and late bowel obstruction which occurred after left hemicolectomy and abdominoperineal resection, respectively.",

Methods and Procedures: In our health institute, weekly MDT conferences were initiated in January 2015. Meetings were attended by surgeons, radiologists, radiation and medical oncologists and key nursing personnel. All rectal cancer patients diagnosed and treated in 2014-2015 in the General Surgery Division of the \"Carlo Urbani\" hospital in Jesi (AN, Italy) were included. Then, the data from rectal cancer patients in 2014 were evaluated, before the adoption of MDT and in year 2015, after the adoption of meetings. Datasets regarding demographics, tumor stage, treatment, and outcomes based on pathology after operation were obtained. During an MDT discussion patient history, clinical and psychological condition, co-morbidity, modes of work-up, clinical staging, and optimal treatment strategies were discussed. A database was created to include each patient's workup, treatments to date and recommendations by each specialty. ''Demographic variables'' consisted of age at diagnosis, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system, clinical stage and pathological stage. Other analyzed variables included baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), the type of imaging, use of neoadjuvant chemo-radiation, restaging following neoadjuvant therapy, distance from the anal verge, operation type and use of adjuvant chemo-radiation. ''Outcome variables'' consisted in a comparison for each group between clinical and pathological stage.

Introduction: Serpin E1, also known as Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an inhibitor of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activators (tPA ). PAI-1 plays a role in the regulation of angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumor cell invasion; over expression has been noted in breast, esophageal, and colorectal cancer (CRC). PAI-1 is also a potent regulator of endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and migration in vitro and of angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. The plasminogen/plasmin system plays a key role in cancer progression by mediating extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell migration. Surgery's impact on plasma PAI-1 levels is unknown. This study's purpose was to measure plasma PAI-1 levels before and during the first month after minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR) for CRC. Objectives: Retroflexion in the rectum at the end of a colonoscopy is a requirement for a complete endoscopic evaluation. Retroflexion helps to visualize and detect polyps which would be missed otherwise. Currently new endoscopes are available which can do retroflexion in the caecum.

It is expected that new generation compounds wholly selective for specific cellular components are now needed for further advance and a variety of molecular targets have been proposed and are being developed primarily for oncological imaging purposes. Recent publications have however suggested ICG itself is retained within malignant tissue differently to its uptake and clearance from surrounding non-malignant tissue which is important for two reasons. Firstly, it exploits and makes visual the increased vascular permeability and disordered clearance associated with carcinogenesis which is a common endpoint of a variety of mediators including but not limited to VEGF. This raises the useful option of targeting downstream effects of cancer compounds on a metabolic basis as opposed to tagging individual cell or antigen components. This means that a single agent could be used to target a variety of cancers rather then needing a specific one for each specific sub-type as well as obviating the issue of cancer cells heterogeneity even in a single cancer deposit. Second, it is very likely that some or all of the \"localisation\" effect of proposed selective compounds may well be due to a similar phenomenum rather then cell-specific binding and may make distinction from other areas of similar metabolic behaviour (ie inflammatory regions) difficult. The crucial step-advance for such agent development so may well relate to timing of compound delivery and \"visualisation window\" at the region of interest rather then highly selective oncocellular-targeting. To illustrate this in more detail, we have been examining the tissue-specific effects and actions of near-infrared excitation in patients (n=7) with localised malignant colorectal primaries receiving an aliquot of ICG before such examination at the time of resection. ICG can be selectively apparent in the colorectal primary 15 minutes after its systemic administration likely due to altered vascular dynamics. Additional dose-related work has shown that early administration (40-180 minutes before examination) does not give useful information related to tumour fluorescence. Interestingly none of these patients had fluorescence seen within their regional lymphatics but none also had malignant lymph nodes associated with their large primaries on pathological examination. However, this procedure is not usually performed in laparoscopic APR for its technique difficulty, which may lead to increased rates of complications ( Fig. 1) . Here, we compared the feasibility and peri-operative outcomes of the laparoscopic APR with and without pelvic peritoneum closure (PPC) for lower rectal cancer.

However, LLND must also be performed laparoscopically if surgery for lower rectal carcinoma is to be carried out as a completely laparoscopic procedure. Transanal TME (TaTME) is expected to provide better results than the conventional TME, both oncologically and in terms of pelvic function, and its use has recently been spreading in Japan. We started performing laparoscopic TaTME+LLND in our department in July 2016 and here report the short-term outcomes. Subjects and Methods: We used laparoscopic TaTME+LLND to treat 5 men and 3 women with cT3 or deeper rectal carcinoma in whom the inferior margin of the tumor was on the anal side of the peritoneal reflection. This was a retrospective study of short-term postoperative outcomes. Surgical Procedure: Laparoscopic surgery was started simultaneously by two teams, one working transabdominally and the other working transanally. The transabdominal team performed the standard proximal LLND and mobilization of the splenic flexure via five ports. They then dissected the bilateral lateral lymph nodes, mainly in the obturator (#283) and internal iliac (#263) groups. During this time, the transanal team performed laparoscopic TaTME. Finally, both dissection layers were connected and the cancer was excised. Results: Six patients had clinical stage II and two had clinical stage III lower rectal carcinoma. All the patients underwent preoperative chemotherapy with S-1+L-OHP. Five underwent a sphincterpreserving surgery, and three underwent rectal amputation. The mean operating time was 335 minutes (range, 267-382 minutes), and the mean amount of hemorrhage was 136 g (20-440 g). The mean number of lymph nodes dissected was 24, and R0 resection was performed in all the cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 14 days, and a postoperative complication of Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher occurred in one patient (anastomotic failure).",

Apart from the ease of applying a stapler, cases of second group with gangrenous base were easily tackled using endostapler, avoiding the need of a hemicolectomy. Conclusion: All forms of closure of the appendix base are acceptable, but endostapler technique apart from providing a secure base, reduces operative time and is an essential tool in cases of gangrenous base. Introduction: Accurate staging is essential to estimate the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and lymph node evaluation is key to determine it. In non-metastatic CRC, the number of harvested lymph nodes is the strongest prognostic factor for outcome and survival. Additionally, it is thought that a higher lymph node yield may be representative of a higher quality of surgical care. Due to the importance of the association between lymph node evaluation and outcome in CRC, it is necessary to evaluate factors which may affect lymph node harvest. Introduction: Hatmann's procedure is commonly done in treating complicated diverticulitis, negleccted rectal trauma with sepsis and sometimes malignancy. the traditional techniques to restore the intestinal continuity after Hartmann's procedure were for many years the standard of care in these operations, but in fact they carry many morbidity and even mortality and failure. laparoscopic techniques is not only carry the advantage of minimal invasive surgery, but also of better visualizationn and magnification. the aim is evaluating the outcome of using the laparoscope in reversal of Hartmann's procedure as regard feasibility and safety. Patients and Method: Forty patients were subjected to laparoscopic reversal of Hatmann's procedure in Tanta University Hospital, there ages ranged between 25 to 70 years, the time elapsed after the original operation ranged from 6 months to 5 years, excluding advanced malignany. conversin occurred in 6 cases due to extensive adhesions and bleeding. Results: No mortality, or major morbidity in our study and only single leak treated by covering ilestomy. Conclusion; Laparoscopic Hartmann's procedure is feasible, promising tehnique with minimal morbidity. Background: Minimal invasive surgery has been well established in the elective colorectal surgery and it has been proven better clinical outcome compared with open surgery. In the emergent setting, laparoscope is used mostly in the colecystectomy, appendectomy but laparoscopic emergent colorectal surgery is limited for it's complexity and difficulity.

Background: The double stapling technique (DST) has widely spread colorectal anastomosis especially for anastomosis after low anterior resection. As for the colorectal cancer treatment, Heald reported total mesorectal excision (TME) in 1982, and has been accepted as the standard technique for rectal resection due to the decreased local recurrence rate and improved functional results. With advent of DST, there is a background that it has become possible to preserve anus, even in the case with the lesion at lower rectum. Laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer was introduced in the 1990s, and has had promising results including long-term outcomes. According to the spread of laparoscopic surgery, laparoscopic surgery had been applied to the rectal resection, with technical difficulty. One of the reasons for the difficulty is that the high rate of anastomotic leakage, a critical adverse effect of low anterior resection (LAR). Thus, risk factors for anastomotic leakage were widely discussed, including technical factors such as pre-compression and number or firing. The decisive difference in conventional LAR and laparoscopic LAR in DST, is the stapler used for transection of the rectum. The laparoscopic staplers which are currently available are thought to be not ideal, and there is little evidence of specific specifications of stapler for laparoscopic surgery. Materials and Methods: All method described in this study was approved by the institutional ethical review committee. We reviewed the colon and rectal wall thickness according to histological examination using H&E staining of distal margin of resected specimen of the patients who Conclusions: RSTC for severe acute UC is at least as safe as the laparoscopic approach. Although the robotic cohort had more comorbidities, major postoperative complications, readmissions, and reoperation rates were less when compared to LSTC. RSTC was also associated with an earlier return of bowel function and shorter length of stay. A prospective study with larger numbers is needed to see if the superiority of robotic versus laparoscopic approaches is reproducible. S198 Surg Endosc (2018) Introduction: Complete mesocolic excision (CME) has been advocated based on oncologic superiority, but is not commonly performed in North America. Furthermore, many data are limited to case series with few comparative studies. Therefore the objective was to systematically review studies comparing the short-and long-term outcomes between CME and non-CME colectomy for colon cancer. Methods: A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines of MEDLINE, EMBASE, HealthStar, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Studies were only included if they compared conventional resection (non-CME) to CME for colon cancer. Quality was assessed using the Methodological Index For Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS). The main outcome measures were short-term morbidity and oncologic outcomes. Study eligibility, data extraction and quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers, and disagreements resolved by consensus. Weighted pooled means and proportions with 95%CI were calculated using a randomeffects model when appropriate. Results: Out of 825 citations, 23 studies underwent full-text review and 14 met the inclusion criteria, of which 10 were unique series. Mean MINORS score was 13.6 (range 11-16). The mean sample size in the CME group was 1075 (range 45-3756) and 785 (range 40-3425) in the non-CME group. In the 10 unique studies, 4 included only right-sided resection, and 44.2% (95% CI 35.8-52.6) of the remaining 6 were right-sided colectomies. Of the 5 studies that reported surgical approach, 52.2% (95%CI 31.0-73.3) of CME were performed laparoscopically. There were 4 papers reporting plane of dissection, with CME plane achieved in 87.4% (79.7-95.2). Mean OR time in CME group was 167 minutes (range 163-171) and in non-CME group 138 minutes (range 135-142). Perioperative morbidity was reported in 6 studies, with pooled overall complications of 22.5% (95%CI 18.4-26.6) for CME and 19.6 (95%CI 13.6-25.5) for non-CME resections. Anastomotic leak occurred in 6.0% (95%CI 2.2-9.7) of CME versus 6.0% (95%CI 4.1-7.9) in non-CME colectomies. CME surgery consistently resulted in more lymph nodes retrieved, longer distance to high tie, and specimen length. There were 7 studies that compared 3-or 5-year overall or disease-free survival, or local recurrence. Only 2 studies reported statistically significant higher disease-free or overall survival in favour of CME. Local recurrence was lower after CME in 1 of 4 reported studies.",

Conclusion: The reported results, regarding no conversion rate, nor mortality, on our series of patients, suggest that single stage laparoscopic re intervention is feasible, despite fecal peritonitis. Introduction: Total mesorectal excision is known to be a gold standard surgical procedure for the rectal cancer. Subsequently complete mesocolic excision (CME) is recognized as an essential surgical procedure for the colon cancer. The transverse colon is relatively minor location for colon cancer. Variety of vessels and mobilization of splenic flexure and dissection close to pancreas make operations for the transverse colon cancer complicated. Laparoscopic transverse mesocolic excision in our hospital is presented. Method: laparoscopic surgery is conducted with five trocars under the lithotomy position. Inferior mesenteric vein is cut after dissection of the descending colon with medial approach. The lower edge of pancreas is exposed near the inferior mesenteric vein and is dissected along toward the tail of pancreas. The splenic flexure is mobilized with lateral approach and the dissection between transverse mesocolon and the lower edge of pancreas is continued in the direction to the pancreas head. Coming to the exposure of superior mesenteric artery and vein, the origin of middle colic artery and vein are cut. The transverse mesocolon is separated from the pancreas head and the duodenum with preserving the gastrocolic trunk of Henle and the right gastroepiploic vein. The hepatic flexure is mobilized and CME for the transverse colon is finished. This method, the 'tail to head of pancreas' approach, we called, was performed from September 2015. This method is well performed with one series of surgical view, and seems to be a simple procedure as CME with central vascular ligation for the transverse colonic cancer. There were no intraoperative complications, and one postoperative pancreatitis with grade ? of Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. Conclusion: Our method, the 'tail to head of pancreas' approach, with transverse mesocoloc excision is simple, safe and feasible.",

There are various types of anastomotic complication and they have different severity. This study was aimed to evaluate the impact of intraoperative colonoscopy on detection of anastomotic complication, and its effectiveness in treatment of anastomotic complications after anterior resection (AR) and low anterior resection (LAR) for colorectal cancer intraoperatively. Methods: From Dec. 2016 to Jul. 2017, a total of 72 patients who underwent anastomosis between sigmoid colon and rectum after colorectal resection were reviewed retrospectively. Intraoperative colonoscopy was performed routinely since December 2016 in our hospital after anterior resection and low anterior resection. To identify effectiveness of intraoperative colonoscopy, we compared postoperative complications with non-intraoperative colonoscopy group during previous 11 months. Intraoperative colonoscopy was performed after anastomosis to visualize the anastomosis line and to perform an air leakage test. If anastomotic defect and moderate bleeding were found in intraoperative colonoscopy, it was managed by means of reinforcement suture or transanal suture repair. We used Logistic regression to analyze anastomotic complication between two groups with or without intraoperative colonoscopy. Results: Of the 72 patients who were performed intraoperative colonoscopy after AR (n=50) and LAR (n=22), abnormal findings including bleeding and air leak were found in 14 patients (19.4%). Among those, 9 cases were observed without any procedure, additional procedures were performed in 5 patients (6.9%, transanal suture (3), Lembert suture (2)). Postoperative complication was developed in 12 patients; 6 patients had anastomosis bleeding (8.3%), 2 patients had ileus (2.8%), 1 patient had pneumonia (1.4%), 3 patients had minor complication (4.2%, acute urinary retention, chylous drainage, laparoscopic port site bleeding). Among 6 patients who had anastomosis bleeding, 4 patients were treated by endoscopic clipping, 2 patients were cured by conservative treatment. There was no postoperative anastomotic leakage. The cases of AR and LAR were 62 and 48 in non-intraoperative colonoscopy group, there was no significant difference between two group (P=0.07). The proportion of laparoscopic surgery was 86.4% and 92.2% on intraoperative colonoscopy and non-intraoperative colonoscopy group, respectively, there was significant difference statistically (P=0.02).

But we need more multicenter, prospective, and large sample clinical studies to validate our findings. Introduction: Lymph node (LN) retrieval after surgery is important. In the present study we evaluated the efficacy of the fat dissolution technique using fluid containing collagenase and lipase to avoid staging migration after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Methods: Seventeen patients who underwent laparoscopic LN dissection for colorectal cancer were evaluated. First, unfixed LNs within the resected mesentery were explored by visual inspection and palpation immediately after the operation by the surgeon, which is the most common practice in Japan. Subsequently, the fat dissolution technique was used on remnant fat tissue, and the LNs were evaluated again. The primary endpoint was whether the second assessment increased the number of LNs evaluated. Results: The median number of LNs identified at the first and second assessments was 14 and 6, respectively, resulting in a significant increase in the total number of LNs evaluated (14 vs. 21, P\\ 0.01, paired t-test). One positive node was identified among all the additional LNs identified (1.0%; 1/96). Although staging was not altered in any patient, the second assessment resulted in an increase in the originally insufficient number of LNs evaluated (\\12 for Stage II) in three patients, whose treatment may be altered. Tumor cells detected after the fat dissolution technique were stained with carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin-20. Conclusion: Using the fat dissolution liquid on remnant fat tissue of the mesentery of the colon and rectum enabled identification of additional LNs. This method should be considered when the number of LNs identified is not sufficient after conventional LN retrieval, and may avoid stage migration. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the pathological resection margin after laparoscopic intersphincteric resection for low rectal cancer. Method: From 2010 to 2014, there were eight laparoscopic intersphincteric resection cases for low rectal cancer. We evaluated the clinicopathological findings and the positivity of pathological resection margin. Results: The median distance from the anal verge to the tumor was 40 mm (range, 10-45), and the median diameter of the tumor was 27 mm (range, 15-60). There was no case with neoadjuvant therapy. The estimated tumor depth were cT1 in 5 cases (62.5%) and cT2 in 3 cases (37.5%), and the actual tumor depth were pTis in 3 cases (37.5%) and pT1 in 2 cases (25.0%) and pT2 in 3 cases (37.5%). The median distal resection margin was 10 mm (range, 5-25). Pathological resection margin, such as the proximal, distal and circumferential margin was negative in all cases (100%).

One patient's segmental resection contained only benign pathology requiring a second operation to remove the cancer. On univariate analysis, time between endoscopy and surgery (but not patient age, gender, BMI, endoscopist or surgeon seniority, tumor size or location) was significantly associated with absence of tattoo intraoperatively (p=0.006). Conclusion: Recording related to tattoo is variable but definite lack of gross tattoo visualisation significantly impacts the procedure. The mechanism of tattoo absence is multifactorial needing careful consideration but solvable. The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to determine the role of antibiotics in the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (AUD). Diverticular disease is the most common disease of the large bowel and poses a significant burden on healthcare resources. In the United States alone, the cost of diverticular disease has been estimated to be over $3 billion making it the fifth most important gastrointestinal disease economically. The use of antibiotics in the management of AUD, however, is primarily based on expert opinion as current high-quality evidence is lacking. Recent studies have not only questioned the optimal type and duration of antibiotic regimens, but whether antibiotics provide any benefit in the treatment of AUD. Conclusions: Antibiotic use in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is not associated with a reduction in major complications, readmissions, treatment failure, progression to complicated diverticulitis, or need for elective and emergent surgery. However, it increases the length of hospital stay. Given the risk of selection bias in included studies, further randomized trials are needed to clarify the need for antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis.",

The down-regulated SIK1 implies poor clinical outcome measured by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P-value\\0.05), and may act as an independent risk factor of CRC patients. Background: Surgical specimens for resected colon cancer vary in quality and there remains no universally accepted technique to guide resection margins. A minimum of 12 lymph nodes provides some quality assurance, however this remains a crude marker of optimal oncological surgery. A tool to precisely identify lymphatic drainage within the mesentery could improve the oncologic quality of resection and better guide adjuvant treatment through more optimal mesenteric lymphadenectomy. While fluorescence imaging (FI) has been described to identify nodal disease in several other cancers, feasibility and best practices have not been established in colon cancer. We describe a novel technique of FI using Indocyanine Green (ICG) to identify lymphatic spread and potentially guide optimal mesenteric lymphadenectomy in colon cancer. Methods: Three consecutive patients with colon cancer undergoing a laparoscopic resection had peritumoral subserosal injection of ICG for FI after extracorporealization of the mobilized specimen. Three concentrations of ICG were injected \u22125 mg/10 mL, 5 mg/5 mL, and 5 mg/3 mL. A total of 4 mL was given for each patient. Using a modified laparoscopic camera, the ICG was excited by light in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, for real-time visualization of the lymphatic drainage. The main outcome measure was identification of lymphatic drainage. Results: Three patients with right-sided primary colon cancer were evaluated. All three patients had successful identification of the lymphatic drainage pattern along the mesentery. The most successful protocol was 1 mL (concentration 5 mg/10 mL) subserosal injection at 4 points within close proximity (1 cm) of the tumor with a 23-gauge needle, then waiting 5 minutes for complete mapping. No intraoperative or injection-related adverse effects occurred with 30-day follow-up. The median lymph node yield was 31. All specimens had tumor-free margins. Conclusion: From this small series, fluorescence imaging with ICG is a potentially safe and feasible technique for identifying mesocolic lymphatic drainage patterns. This proof of concept and protocol will lead to future studies to examine the utility of fluoresence imaging to guide more precise surgery in colon cancer. Introduction: anastomotic leakage in colon/rectal surgery is a dangerous event with an occurance rate ranging from 1 to 30%. The associated mortality rate is between 6-22%. The white-light intraoperative subjective surgical assessment (the most frequently used approach) underestimates the actual anastomotic leakage rate. Intraoperative tissue perfusion assessment by Indocyanine green (ICG)-enhanced fluorescence has been reported in multiple clinical scenarios in laparoscopic/ robotic surgery, as well as for for bowel perfusion assessment. This technology can detect microvascular impairment, potentially preventing anastomotic leakage. We reviewed the literature and present our data to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of ICG-enhanced ?uorescence in the intraoperative assessment of vascular peri-anastomotic tissue perfusion in colorectal surgery. Methods and Procedures: A PubMed literature narrative review has been performed. Moreover, out of a total of 164 robotic colorectal cases, we retrospectively analyzed 28 ICG-enhanced fluorescence robotic colorectal resections (15 left colectomies-8 rectal resections-3 right-1 transverse-1 pancolectomy).",

At this stage ICG, beside being a promising technique, doesn't have high level of evidence (most of the reports are retrospective). Some randomized prospective trials with an adequate statistical power are needed. A precise injection dose and timing standardization is required. The main challange is to develop a method to objectively obtain a real-time intensity assessement.

Introduction: According to the World Health Organization, colorectal cancer is the 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. One of the main risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer is obesity. Obesity is seen to increase the risk of colorectal cancer by 9% in women per 5 kg/m 2 and 24% in men per 5 kg/m 2 .

Results: The patients were 6 men and 7 women, with a mean age of 40.8 years (range, 21-72 years). En block resection was performed by EMR in all cases. The endoscopic mean size of tumors was 6.46 mm (range, 5-10 mm). The pathologically measured mean size of the resected specimens was 5.92 mm (range, 4-10 mm). The mean size of resected carcinoid tumors was 4.33 mm (range, 1.8-7 mm). The tumor shape was submucosal tumor in 10 and polyp in 3. Histological examination revealed that 5 cases had resection margin positive of tumor and 1 case had undetermined resection margin of tumor. Of the 6 patients, 4 patients underwent endoscopic treatment and 2 patients underwent transanal excision. No residual tumor was found in additionally removed tissue.

Vascular smooth muscle strips from the IPA relaxed longitudinally. Electrical stimulation of the PSN increased blood flow in the IPA and also elevated the cavernous pressure. These increases were blocked in part by phentolamine, but not by propranolol or atropine. The effects of cholinergic and adrenergic agonists and antagonists on mechanical responses were also examined in muscle strips obtained from various arteries in the intra-pelvic region including the IPA. Norepinephrine induced contraction in the iliac artery and relaxation in the IPA, and both the contraction and relaxation responses were blocked by phentolamine but not by propranolol.

Introduction: Currently, neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT) followed by low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection are the standard treatments for locally advanced rectal cancer. nCRT can improve resecability, achieve better sphincter preservation and reduce local recurrence. Although total mesorectal excision is the standard treatment for advanced rectal cancer, recent trends in minimally invasive treatments led to an increase in local excision or \"watch and wait\" in patients with an excellent response to nCRT. The purpose of this study, part of an ongoing research, is critically evaluating the feasibility of \"non-operative treatment\" for rectal cancer in a district hospital. Methods and Procedures: A total of 29 patients with rectal cancer, who where treated with nCRT from January to August 2017 at \"Carlo Urbani\" district Hospital in Jesi (Italy), were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had histologically-confirmed primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum located within 12 cm from the anal verge. The involved patients completed nCRT and had no recurrence disease, distant metastasis, synchronous malignancies.

Our data did not entirely support this policy although it might be the best strategy, based on the predictors of tumor regression, to avoid the complications associated with surgery in elderly patients with significant medical comorbidities and fear of a permanent stoma. Introduction: Conventional 5 incision laparoscopic surgery procedure for rectal cancer is widely accepted as a successful alternative to laparotomy now, bestowing specific advantages without causing detriment to oncological outcome. Evolving from this, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been successfully utilized for the removal of colonic tumors, but the literature lacks sufficient data analyzing the suitability of SILS for rectal cancer especially for total resection mesorectal excision (TME), particularlyon oncological outcome. We report the short-term clinical and oncological outcomes from a large cases retrospective analysis of observational study of SILS for TME procedure of rectal cancer. Methods: 95 rectal cancer patients who underwent transumbilical single incision laparoscopic TME surgery were recruited in the current study. Short-term perioperative clinical parameters and oncological outcomes were observed and all patients were followed up after surgery. Then summarize the preliminary application results. Results: 87 operations were accomplished successfully with single incision laparoscopy, 7 patients were converted to multiport approach, and 1 was converted to laparotomy, no diverting ileostomy was performed. The average operative time was (128.5\u00b143.6) min, with an average blood loss of (75.5\u00b1121.7) ml, the median postoperative hospital stay was (10.3\u00b12.1) days.

Anastomotic leakage has been commonly regarded as one of the toughing postoperative complications in laparoscopic mid/low rectal cancer surgery, attenuating the short-term clinical benefits. The left colic artery (LCA) has been routinely central-ligated in dissection process to guarantee the oncological effects, which may potentially attribute to the postoperative ischemia-induced anastomotic leakage in the patients with left-colic vessel variation, e.g. bypass or absent of Riolan arch. However, no specific study focuses on the surgical benefits of LCA preservation compares to conventional ones. Herein, we conduct a single center randomized controlled trial, demonstrating that LCA-preserving technique shows significant reduction rate of postoperative leakage as well as overall complications comparing to the traditional central-ligation group. No difference in survival rate and recurrence in short term is found between the two groups. The LCA-preserving strategy is proven to be repeatedly safe and feasible, potentially reduce the risk of anastomotic leakage with comparable short-term outcomes. Further investigation is required for both the oncological safety and long-term prognosis for this innovative technique.

Alvim pts were younger (60.4 vs. 63.8 years old, p=0.002) and, as regards comorbidities, less likely to have heart disease (CAD 4.1% vs 13.9%, other heart disease 13.2% vs 19.5%) but were otherwise similar. The rate of laparoscopic-assisted (Alvim, 80.9%; No Alvim, 68%) and hand assisted or hybrid operations (Alvim, 19.1%; No Alvim, 32%) were similar. Alvim pts had significantly earlier return of flatus (2.4 vs 2.9 days) and first BM (2.6 vs 3.5, p\\0.001 for both) than the No Alvim group. There was also a trend toward a shorter LOS (6.1 vs 6.7 days, p=0.05) for the Alvim group. Overall complication rates were similar, however, Alvim pts had lower rates of post-operative ileus (5.3% vs 14.1%, p\\0.0002), sSSI's (5.8 vs 10%, p=0.04), and blood transfusion (7.1 vs 13.0%, p=0.01) than the No Alvim group. Conclusion: The two groups compared were largely similar (most co-morbidities, indications, CRR type) with the differences in age and cardiac issues noted. The impact of the higher rates of sSSI's, blood transfusion, and MI in the no Alvim group on GI function is unclear. Pts who received Alvim periop had an accelerated return of bowel function, decreased postoperative ileus and shorter length of stay. These results suggest that Alvim is effective in reducing the postoperative ileus but further study is warranted.

Blood flow evaluation of oral stumps was performed with measurement of fluorescence time (FT) using HEMS and SPIES. And bloodflow was also evaluated by thermography. Result: Evaluation by ICG system: In all cases, the AL rate was 8.1% (7/86 cases). Over 60 FT cases, the AL rate was 60%, higher than that of under 60 s cases and these patinets need additional management, covering stoma or additional resection. And in border cases, FT 50*60 sec, AL rate is 10.0%, higher than under 50 s cases. In these borderline cases, if covering stoma was performed in patinets with more than three well known risk factors, the AL rate reduced to 2.6% and false positive was 6.9%. And under 50 s cases, they need no additional management. Evaluation by thermography: In residual intestine, the temperature was siginificantly higher than resected intestine (31.5 vs 29.0?, p\\0.01). And the temperature in FT under 50 s cases was significantly higher than over FT over 50 s cases (26.3 vs 30.8?). The temperatue and FT was tended to be oppositely correlated (R 2 =0.36). Conclusion: Both ICG system and thermography may be useful to avoid anastomotic leakage. Introduction: Some patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for rectal cancer achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) in which no tumor cells are discovered during pathologic analysis of the resection specimen. Achievement of pCR is correlated to improved prognoses relative to non-pCR counterparts. Such correlations are not well established in the context of a community-based hospital. The study sought to examine response rates, recurrences, and survivals in locally advanced rectal cancer patients and compare patient outcomes to those achieved at major academic institutions. Methods and Procedures: A single-center retrospective chart review was performed at a local, community-based hospital. Study population consisted of 118 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgical resection. Patients with a history of metastasis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), hereditary cancer syndromes, concurrent or prior malignancy, and emergent surgery were excluded.",

Surgical Procedure: After performing ractal lavage, self-retaining anal retractor was set, and anal dilators were used for an atraumatic introduction of the transanal access devise (GelPOINT path). Three of 10-mm trocars and one of 15-mm trocar were inserted through the GelPOINT path in a quadrant shape. Then the GelPOINT path was introduced through the anal to rectum. After rectosigmoid colon was temporally clamped using an atraumatic endo bulldog clip, pneumoperitoneum was maintained at 15 mmHg with carbon dioxide via an Air Seal platform.

A near-obstructing rectal adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the liver was discovered. After completing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, he underwent laparoscopic low-anterior colon resection and simultaneous open hepatic trisegmentectomy.

In low rectum cancer cases, we kept the good pelvic visualization to lifting the peritoneum of the bladder onto the ventral side using the Lone Star Retractor StaysTM. Results: The median age was 70 years (56-91 years), with 9 males and 10 females, and body mass index was 21.1 kg/ m 2 (16-25 kg/m 2 ). Anterior resection was performed in 2 cases, low anterior resection in 7 cases, intersphincteric resection in 4 cases, abdominoperineal resection in 4 cases, Hartmann's procedure in 2 cases, and lateral lymph node dissection in 1 case. In addition, one case of T4b (bladder) was converted from laparoscopic to open surgery. However, there were no cases in which needlescopic instruments were replaced with conventional forceps. Moreover, intraoperative complications related to the forceps were not observed. Conclusions: In rectum cancer surgery, needlescopic instruments leave a small postoperative wound; healing is rapid and the cosmetic result is excellent. Surgical safety is comparable to that using conventional forceps. There is no problem with the rigidity of needlescopic instruments. However, where the shaft is curved, operative control requires attention to mobility and directionality. In low rectum surgery, use of needlescopic instruments is limited due to the curvature of the shaft during the dissection of the anterior rectum wall, but it is possible to maintain a good field of view by using auxiliary equipment. Therefore, more cases could be considered for surgeries using needlescopic instruments with the help of auxiliary equipment. Introduction: Anastomotic leaks are devastating complications of colorectal operations that lead to significant morbidity and potential mortality. Inadequate tissue perfusion is considered a key contributor to anastomotic failure following colorectal operations. Currently, clinical judgment is the most commonly used method for evaluating adequate blood supply to an anastomosis. More recently intraoperative laser angiography using indocyanine green (ICG) has been utilized to assess tissue viability, particularly in reconstructive plastic surgery. This technology provides a real-time evaluation of tissue perfusion and is a helpful tool for intra-operative decisions, particularly in deciding to revise an intended colorectal anastomosis. Our study aimed to determine if there is a statistical significance in colorectal anastomotic leak or abscess rate using ICG compared to common clinical practice. Methods and Procedures: 126 patients undergoing left-sided colorectal operations, between March 2012 and February 2015, were retrospectively reviewed. 55 patients' colorectal anastomoses were evaluated using ICG angiography (ICGa) to qualitatively assess tissue perfusion (ICG group). Peri-operative and post-operative outcomes, including anastomotic leak and abscess rates, were compared to 65 patients who had colorectal operations without ICGa (control group). The primary outcomes of intra-abdominal leak rate and intra-abdominal abscess rate were compared using exact Chi-square tests. The secondary outcomes of 30-days OR return, mortality, and readmission rate were compared using Chi-square tests. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software. Results: Two leading indications for surgery included malignancy (n = 57) and diverticulitis (n = 48). The majority of patients either had a low anterior resection (n = 75) or sigmoidectomy (n = 42). All operations were primarily minimally invasive. No statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups in regards to patient demographics, rate of proximal diversion (p = 0.112), and splenic flexure mobilization (p = 0.200). Patients in the ICGa group were more likely to have high IMA ligation than in the control group (70.9% vs. 24.4%, p-value\\0.001). Of the ICGa group, 16 of the 55 patients underwent additional colonic resection while 39 of the 55 did not undergo additional colonic resection. There was no statistically significant difference in primary or secondary outcomes between the two groups. Conclusion: ICG angiography has become a helpful adjunct in determining adequate perfusion to an intended colorectal anastomosis. This data is unable to support any difference in patient outcome utilizing this technology over surgeons' visual and clinical assessment. Our results may contribute to larger studies to determine if there is a true difference in anastomotic leak or abscess rate using this technology.

The aim of this study is to investigate usefulness of \"One-stop shop\" simulation for liver surgery using EOB-MRI. Methods: Accuracy of liver vasculatures: 3D-reconstruction of dynamic EOB-MRI imaging was done by SYNAPSE VINCENT software (FUJIFILM Medical Co., Ltd., Japan), using a manual tracing method. Visualization of hepatic vessels in EOB-MRI was compared with that in dynamic CT in 10 patients. Assessment of liver functional reserve: The standardized signal intensity (SI) of each segment was calculated by SI of each segment divided by SI of the right erector spine muscle. The standardized total liver functional volume (TLFV) was calculated by \u2211 [k=1 to 8] (standardized SI of segment (k)9volume of segment (k)) divided by body surface area. The following formula of resection limit was established using 28 normal liver cases (70% of the liver is resectable) and 5 unresectable cirrhotic patients such as recipients of liver transplantation (0% of the liver is resectable). The estimated resection limit (%)=70% 9 (the standardized TLFV of the patient -962)/1,076. This formula was validated using other 30 patients who underwent hepatectomy.",

Total laparoscopic procedures were completed with the operation time of 250 minutes and the blood loss below measurable limits. No appreciable complications were observed after surgery and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 12. No recurrence of the disease was detected until 5 years after surgery, Conclusion: Although further validation is unlikely because of a rare incidence of this anatomy, the same technique would be recommended for one of the preoperative preparations for similar cases. Background: Surgical simulation is thought to provide a basis for improvement of resident surgical skill training, in the safety of a simulation setting. It is unclear whether surgical skills learned in a simulation curriculum actually contribute to the improvement of surgical skills when transferred to the OR. Methods: A ten question online survey was sent to attending surgeons and residents. The questionnaire focused on 5 domains: confidence, independence, transferable skills, improvement of skills/knowledge and time spent on the simulation curriculum. Evaluation data was collected and anonymously analyzed. Background: Minimally invasive surgery poses a unique learning curve due to the requirement for non-intuitive psychomotor skills. Programmes such as the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) provide mandatory training and certification for many residents. However, predictors of FLS performance and retention remain to be described. This single-centre observational study aimed to assess for factors predicting the acquisition and retention of FLS performance amongst a surgically na\u00efve cohort. Methods: Laparoscopically na\u00efve individuals were recruited consecutively from preclinical years of a medical university. Participants completed five visuospatial and psychomotor tests followed by a questionnaire surveying demographics, extracurricular experiences and personality traits. Individuals completed a baseline assessment of the five FLS tasks evaluated by FLS standards. Subsequently, participants attended a 270-minute training-course over week one and two on inanimate box trainers. A post-training assessment was performed in week three to evaluate skill acquisition. Participants were withdrawn from laparoscopic exposure and retested at four onemonth intervals to assess skill retention. Introduction: Bipolar energy can cause thermal injury to adjacent organs when used improperly. SAGES FUSE curriculum provides didactic knowledge on principles and best practices for safety, but there is no hands-on component to practice these skills. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the VEST\u2122 Bipolar training module in addition to the FUSE Curriculum.",

Background: Laparoscopic anterior resection is technically challenging and the learning curve is long. Well-designed formative assessments can provide trainees effective and constructive feedback, an important element in efficient learning. Previously reported assessments for laparoscopic colorectal procedures were developed for summative assessment. We aimed to develop a formative assessment tool to evaluate competence and provide trainees with effective feedback in laparoscopic anterior resection. Methods: The assessment tool was developed by an expert panel from McGill University affiliated hospitals. The procedure was deconstructed into a series of sequential steps including general domains, surgical principles, injury prevention and technical skills specific to laparoscopic anterior resection. The tool contains 12 discrete items with global rating scales for each step of the operation; each domain was scored using a 5-point Likert scale, with anchors for scores of 1, 3 and 5.",

Background: Colonoscopy is an important diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the management of colonic disease; achieving competence during residency is an integral part of performing high-quality colonoscopy in-practice, regardless of specialty.

Methods and Procedures: This is a multi-institutional prospective cohort study involving eleven surgical trainees (novice endoscopists). The main outcome, colonoscopy competence, was assessed by determining the independent colonoscopy completion rate (ICCR), the number of procedures required to reach 90% independent colonoscopy completion and polyp detection rate. Individual and overall ICCR were calculated using moving average analysis. Conclusions: While a benchmark for a minimum number of procedures may be necessary to allow supervisors to adequately assess performance, it is difficult to determine what number is optimal. There appears to be significant heterogeneity in both overall number of colonoscopies completed by each resident, as well as the mean ICCR and the number of procedures required to reach the current benchmark for competency. The use of learning curves allows real-time tracking of progress and training tailored to the individual, as we move forward in the era of competency-based medical education. Background: With the growing popularity of robotic-assisted surgery, new methods for evaluation of technical skill are necessary to determine when a surgeon is qualified to perform an operation independently. Current evaluation methods are limited to 5 point Likert scales which require a degree of subjective scoring. Surgeons in training need an objective method of evaluation to view progress and target areas for improvement. One method of objectively evaluating surgical performance is a cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM). By plotting consecutive operative outcomes on a CUSUM chart, surgeons can view their learning curve for a given task. Another method of objective evaluation is the dV Logger\u00ae, or \"Black Box,\" which records objective measurements directly from the da Vinci\u00ae system. Methods: We followed two HPB fellows during dry lab simulation of 40 robotic-assisted hepaticojejunostomy reconstructions using biotissues to model a portion of a Whipple procedure. We simultaneously recorded objective measurements of dexterity from the da Vinci\u00ae system and performed CUSUM analyses for each procedural step. We modeled each variable using machine learning (a self-correcting and autoregressive modeling tool) to reflect the fellows' learning curves for each task. Statistically significant objective variables were then combined into a single formula to create an Operative Robotic Index (ORI).",

Introduction: In Chile, medical students have the opportunity to undertake a month-long Medicine Elective (ME) in a community hospital, primary care center or emergency department within the country at the end of their first clinical year. Due to the lack of opportunities to practice suturing in the first years, students usually do not have an optimal performance in this type of medical procedure during the ME. Simulation training programs in suturing improve technical skills, selfconfidence and patient safety in the medical internship. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of implementing a simulated suture training program earlier in the medical curriculum, before the ME. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 50 medical students at the end of their first clinical year. They were randomized into two equal groups. The intervention group received an intensive suture training program consisting in one theory class, four practical sessions and effective feedback from an expert surgeon. The control group did not receive training, remaining with the classic opportunistic learning approach during the ME. After the ME, all students undertook an electronic survey.

We have updated numbers of participants and a comparison method compared with the last year report. Methods and Procedures: Fig. 1 shows our developed computerized system for objective assessment of suturing skills by using a laparoscopic intestinal suturing model, E-Lap. The system includes a new artificial intestinal model that mimics living tissue and pressure-measuring and image-processing devices. Each examinee performs a specific skill using the artificial model, which is linked to a Suture Simulator Instruction Evaluation Unit. The model uses internal air pressure measurements and image processing to evaluate suturing skills. Five criteria, scored on a five-grade scale, were used to evaluate participants' skills ( Fig. 2) . The volume of air pressure leak was determined by the volume of air inside the sutured artificial intestine. For example, for the criterion \"air pressure leakage\", the approximate midpoint of the acceptable range was Grade 3. Values lower than the minimum acceptable value received lower grades and those above the midpoint of the acceptable range higher grades. We enrolled 277 surgeons who participated a simulator competition event at the 29th annual meeting of the Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery (JSES 2016 Houston Methodist Hosptial, 3 Baylor College of Medicine Introduction: The SAGES flexible endoscopy course for minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) fellows has been shown to improve confidence and skills in performing GI endoscopy.

Introduction: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States. Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is an emerging minimally invasive technique that allows complete en-bloc resection and a much lower recurrence rate at long-term follow-ups. However, performing colorectal ESD is technically demanding since the colorectal wall is thin and constantly moving, and potentially higher rates of complications (e.g., bleeding and perforations). Hence, an adequate training for colorectal ESD is needed to acquire basic proficiency with minimum complications.",

Methods: Sixteen medical students were divided randomly and evenly into 2 groups: Control, Training. All subjects performed the cholecystectomy procedure on the VTEST simulator to establish a baseline (pre-test). The training group received 15 training sessions, over a period of 3 consecutive weeks, consisting of 5 trials per session or as many trials as can be accomplished in one hour, whichever was achieved first. At the end of the training period, all subjects performed one trial on the VTEST simulator (post-test), and again 2 to 3 weeks later (retention test). Two months after that, subjects performed the hybrid-NOTES cholecystectomy procedure on an EASIE-R model. Performance with the EASIE-R simulator was video-recorded, and three tasks within the cholecystectomy procedure were isolated for evaluation: clipping, cutting, and dissecting the gallbladder. Objective performance measures, such as time and error, were extracted from the videos by two independent reviewers, while subjective performance was scored by four expert surgeons who were blinded to the training conditions.

Our objective was to compare patients attending the two most commonly used educational formats: online (webinars) and in-person (seminars) and determine which were more likely to undergo bariatric surgery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,700 patients who attended pre-operative information sessions from January 2014 to December 2016 by reviewing data maintained by the Obesity, Prevention, Policy and Management (OPPM) Database from our institution. The patients were divided into two groups: those who attended an in-person session (n=785) and those who attended an online session (n=1,915). The proportion of patients who went on to have bariatric surgery was compared between the two groups. To categorize the study sample, patient demographics, surgeon providing the information session, and procedure performed were compared between groups.

Analysis found that 21.1% of patients who attended online information sessions went on to have a bariatric surgical procedure, while 32.6% of patients who attended in-person sessions went on to have a bariatric surgical procedure. After controlling for differences in age and gender, results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicate that patients who attended inperson sessions were 71% more likely to have a bariatric surgical procedure than patients who attended an online session ( Introduction: Knot security is the ability of knots to resist slippage as force is applied, and the optimal number of throws to ensure a secure knot improves efficiency and outcome. The literature on the accepted number of throws per type of suture material has been largely anecdotal, often referring to 3 throws for silk, 4 for polyglactin 910 (Vicryl), five for polydioxanone (PDS), and six for polyproprolene (Prolene). We report a pilot knot-tying study of four suture types to determine optimal numbers of throws. Materials and Methods: Four senior general surgery residents (PGY-5 and above) and four attending surgeons participated. Participants viewed a standardized instructional video and a one-handed knot-tying tutorial. They were instructed to tie one-handed knots, beginning each knot with two throws in the same direction, and square the third and subsequent throws in the opposite direction. Each surgeon tied 64 knots, using differenttypes of 2-0 suture material: silk, polyglactin, polydioxanone, and polyproprolene. Suture types were evaluated using 3, 4, 5, or 6 throws. The participants were randomized to both suture type and order of throw numbers. The knots were then tested on the F.A.S. T knot tester (Sawbones, Vashon Island, WA) for slippage (insecure knot) or breakage (secure knot). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis was used to determine optimal throw number. Results: 512 knots were individually tested on the knot tester for slippage and recorded as % slipped (see table) . The percentage of slipped knots varied by participant and ranged from 5 to 67%. Generalized estimating equation analysis suggested that the only significant variable when determining knot security was number of throws (p=0.02), not suture type or participant training level. The optimal number of throws for 2-0 silk, polydioxanone, and polypropylene was five, whereas six throws was optimal for polyglactin. Conclusion: Knot security is dependent on the number of throws placed, and these optimal numbers were higher in our study than the commonly accepted number of throws.",

            "text": "Results: Trainees cited multiple competing professional commitments as a barrier to engaging with home-based simulation. They tended to focus on scoring 'points' which contributed toward career progression rather than tasks which were interesting, or associated with personal development. This approach is perpetuated by the surgical training system, which rewards trainees with points for publications and exams, but not for operative skill. This leads to conflict between trainers and trainees, the former expecting trainees to instead focus upon developing their technical abilities. Trainees were unsatisfied with metric feedback and wanted individual feedback from consultant trainers (attending equivalent). Trainees generally perceived consultants as lacking interest toward the programmes and training in general. However, some consultants were in fact unaware of the programmes being delivered and others felt lacking in confidence to deliver necessary training to trainees. Conclusions: Our findings are widely generalizable and have implications for any institution delivering a similar programme. As a means of improving engagement, the the inception of scheduled simulation study days, providing trainees with the opportunity for personalised feedback from consultants, has been suggested. Equipping trainers with the necessary competencies to deliver training can be achieved by ensuring attendance at the necessary professional development courses. Tackling the 'box ticking' culture is more challenging and may involve a move toward restructuring the current surgical training scheme. Introduction: To provide evidence for the face and content validity of a hybrid active-shooter team training simulation and the impact of a hybrid curricular model on learner's engagement and performance. The following study was conducted because hospitals are increasingly threatened by active-shooter incidents, and no active and noticeable training is currently available to train hospital staff members. Methods: Thirty-five volunteers (medical students, residents and other allied health providers) from the University of Minnesota affiliated medical centers were randomly selected and divided into control and experimental groups. The control group (N=14) was given a traditional lecture-style presentation. The experimental group (N=21) participated in the hybrid curriculum which included augmented reality, kinesthetic simulation, and debriefing components. Following both curriculum styles, NASA Task Load Index (TLX) surveys were completed by each group member. A final active shooter simulation experience was presented and evaluated by active-shooter trained raters using a checklist of critical actions from the Department of Defense. A post-simulation NASA TLX survey and Post-test were provided. To assess face and content validation of a hybrid team-training simulation exercise to prepare healthcare personnel in the event of a hospital-related active-shooter crisis, a 5-point Likert-scale survey determined the realism, utility, and applicability of this type of training while engagement and performance during the simulation were measured using a NASA-TLX survey and contrasted with the rater's evaluation. Our study provided evidence to support the face and content validation of an active-shooter simulation team training curriculum as a useful adjunct to health care institutional safety planning. We demonstrated that this type of training requires an optimal level of cognitive activation to increases learner's engagement and performance. We concluded that the hybrid design of our curriculum was successful in delivering these optimal levels of cognitive stimuli by producing engaging team training simulation experience capable of motivating our learners to acquire the tactical skills and life-preserving behaviors consistent with better survival opportunities during a hospital related active-shooter crisis.",

Subjects were asked to complete a five-question multiple choice questionnaire before and after using the simulator. It assessed their knowledge in topics such as direct coupling, capacitive coupling and insulation failure. Participants then used the simulator to complete three tasks. First, the subject used direct coupling to seal a vessel and observed the desired effects and potential pitfalls. In the second task the subject was immersed inside the peritoneal cavity and was directed to use the active electrode to observe how the activation of energy can cause capacitive coupling. In the third task the subject practiced evaluating the insulation of electrosurgical tools for defects.

Introduction: A general misperception of the real concept of robotic surgery seems to be revealed in our clinical practice. Despite its introduction almost years ago, robotic surgery is still related to many myths and beliefs. Before designing a trial to see if these false awareness could impact on outcome, we measured this misperception by a survey. Moreover we tested if medical school is able today to give to the future doctors a necessary knowledge about robotic surgery. With the same survey we explore the feelings about the introduction of the Artificial Intelligence in medicine and the perception of the consequences of a larger use of technology in medicine. Methods and Procedures: a multiple choice survey was designed and anonymously administered via the platform SurveyMonkey (http://www.surveymonkey.com). A total of 55 questions were selected from the research team and included in the survey. The questionnaire was divided in three parts: the first was to get information on participants' population; the second asked specific questions about robotic surgery; the third focused on technology use in medical education.",

Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS) testing is required to complete general surgery residency, but there is no standard metric to convey expertise in advanced laparoscopic procedures. In an effort to develop a standardized assessment of laparoscopic suturing expertise, a group of experts was surveyed using Delphi methodology to reach consensus on observed laparoscopic suturing skills reflective of performing at an expert level. Methods: Expert laparoscopic surgeons participated in serial surveys via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Experts included surgeons who perform[25/year laparoscopic procedures that involve intra-corporeal suturing, obtained from the authors' personal and professions networks. Using a 5 point Likert scale, participants were asked to agree/disagree if 30 different observed laparoscopic suturing skills indicate performing at an expert level. These skills were chosen from prior assessment instruments in the literature and the authors' previously published work. Tasks were considered to meet criteria for consensus and eliminated from the next round of the survey after reaching 80% consensus as \"strongly agree.\" Results of the previous round of surveys were shared with participants at the start of the next round. The predefined endpoint for the Delphi was set as maximum of 4 rounds, reaching 80% consensus on each skill, or if[50% of initial respondents fail to return for subsequent surveys. Results: After the first round of the Delphi survey, 17 respondents met inclusion criteria. Preliminary data demonstrated 4 skills that reached consensus ([80% of respondents chose \"strongly agree\"): forehand suturing, avoiding tissue trauma, having a technically acceptable final product (ie. tight closure), and tying a secure knot at the end of suturing. 4 items did not approach consensus (\\80% of respondents chose \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\"): alternating hands for each throw while tying, never missing a target when grabbing needle/suture, alternating direction of throws when tying, and backhand suturing. Data from all four rounds of surveys as well as the final draft of the assessment instrument will be available at time of presentation. Conclusion: Preliminary data of this Delphi study allowed us to reach consensus amongst a group of expert laparoscopic surgeons on the characteristics of expert laparoscopic suturing, which will allow creation of a comprehensive assessment tool for this domain. Validation of such a tool will help advance the surgical field towards true competency-based credentialing and promotion.

The selection of learners was based on suitable case volume and prior experience in laparoscopic rectal surgery. Objective assessment tools were applied to an unedited video of a laparoscopic rectal surgery case for each applicant. For the selected centres, access to the iLapp TaTME app was provided to access educational content including operative video footage, prior to attending a bespoke cadaveric workshop. Each learner will then benefit from a structured, centrally organised and funded proctorship programme at their own institutions. A global assessment score form has been specifically designed to monitor training and a formal accreditation process will be used to sign off each learner using competency assessment tool. Data on the cadaveric workshop and initial outcomes of the clinical mentorship will be presented at the conference.",

Practicing on a FLS trainer box is effective but requires large amount of consumables and is scored subjectively. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the face validity of the intracorporeal suturing task on a Virtual Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery Simulator (Virtual FLS). We hypothesize that the Virtual FLS will demonstrate face validity. Methods and Procedures: After a video demonstration and a practice period, twenty-three medical students and residents completed an evaluation of the simulator. The participants were asked to perform the standard intracorporeal suturing task on each of the Virtual FLS and the traditional FLS box trainer. The presentation order of the devices was balanced. The performance scores on each device were calculated based on time (seconds), deviations to the black dots (mm), and incision gap (mm). The participants were then asked to finish a 13-question questionnaire regarding the face validity of the simulator. Participants answered questions with ratings from 1 (not realistic/useful) to 5 (very realistic/ useful). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test was performed to identify differences in performance on the Virtual FLS compared to the traditional FLS box trainer.",

The gaps between organs were filled with a filler material mimicking connective tissue. We chose a synthetic resin that closely mimics the characteristics (rigidity or elasticity) of each organ. After each organ was fixed, the model was covered with a filler to create a pleural membrane to allow training in peeling operations. In addition, because a patient plate was attached to the rear of the training model, excision with an energy device was possible and more closely simulated surgical conditions. Results: Using the training model resulted in a highly satisfactory level of experience in three trainees.

We implemented a one-day endoscopic surgery course with the aim of improving the confidence of surgical residents in performing endoscopic procedures. We also aimed to examine the effect of the exposure to this course on self-reported confidence in performing endoscopic procedures. Methods and Procedures: The Fundamental of Endoscopic Surgery Course at Texas Tech University Health Science Center is a one-day course consisting of both didactic training and lab training. The didactic part of the course is taught by attending physicians and focuses on the basics of endoscopy, management of upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and techniques to perform a variety of GI endoscopic procedures on swine esophagus and stomach explant. The lab portion of the course allows residents to perform different endoscopic surgical procedures with the attending physicians providing guidance. Residents from PGY-1 to PGY-5 participated in the course. A 14-item questionnaire that measured the self-reported confidence in performing several endoscopic procedures on a 1-5 Likert scale was administered before and after the course.

Overall, the residents felt that the course was helpful and would like to attend more than one session per year. This course should be held, at least, annually to allow the general surgery residents to become even more confident with this important skill. By being more confident in their surgical endoscopy skills, they will ultimately be able to provide better care for patients. Introduction: A course evaluation study on the effectiveness of improving laparoscopic skills of surgical residents using swine models was evaluated through a self-report questionnaire administered before and after course completion. The purpose of the training is to provide surgical residents opportunities to practice and advance their laparoscopic proficiencies. Methods and Procedures: Participating residents in all post-graduate year levels (PGY1 through PGY5, n=17) were provided anesthetized pigs with which to perform a variety of simple to complex laparoscopic cases. Prior to training, residents were given a questionnaire composed of eleven questions requiring the subjects to rate their confidence in performing various laparoscopic procedures on a 1-5 Likert scale. After completion of the course, an identical questionnaire was distributed with two additional questions relating to the overall impact of the course. All statistical analyses were conducted using R statistical software (version 3. Conclusion: Overall, one-day hands-on training using swine models improved resident's skills, confidence, and understanding of laparoscopic surgery. The information acquired through the questionnaire emphasized the importance of providing a laparoscopic training course as a standard requirement at all medical institutions. Allowing opportunities for surgical residents to practice their laparoscopic skillset will not only help in their individual academic advancements, it will allow them to provide optimum care for their patients. Background: Learning laparoscopy is difficult and many educational tools including simulation training are required. Feedback plays a crucial role for motor skill training but require expert tutors and its time consuming. E-learning increases knowledge acquisition through a more interacting multimedia experience and reduces de costs of learning. In the last decade multiple applications (apps) have been developed for mobile medical training. A new iOS app was developed using specially designed educational videos that explain the main technical aspects in advanced laparoscopy through simulation training. The aim of this study is to present the first results of its incorporation in a surgical simulation lab as a complement of effective feedback. Methods: Twenty-five consecutive residents were trained in our simulation lab through a 15 session validated training program for the acquisition of advanced laparoscopic skills needed for the performance of a laparoscopic hand-sewn jejuno-jejunostomy. Every session had written instructions and a basic tutorial video. The app consist two main sections, the first one explains the essential techniques needed for intracorporeal suturing and the second is a complete walkthrough of the validated training program. The trainees were divided in two groups, the first was trained without using the app (NAPP) and the second group was trained using the app (YAPP). Both groups of trainees could ask for feedback anytime they needed. Trainees were assessed before and after the training program using validated rating scales and the number of necessary tutor-feedback sessions were registered. Finally the YAPP group answered a survey about the strengths and weaknesses of the app for learning advanced laparoscopic skills.",

The code generated various stressor conditions, while recording sensor data from the trainer and human operator. We tested 3 groups of participants in an IRB approved trial including: novices (non-medical students), intermediates (medical students), and experts (PGY4 residents and fellows). The study consisted of subjects performing the peg transfer and the pattern cut six times (baseline, four randomized stressors, posttest). After each task, the NASA-TLX survey was administered to determine the overall workload of that stressor condition. An analysis of variance was conducted to identify significant trends in terms of stressor type. Results: When compared to baseline NASA-TLX scores, the intermediate group had the greatest changes in overall workload than novices and experts (p=0.0005). Additionally, the change between baseline and post-test workload was significantly lower than for the environmental, negative evaluative, and clinical stressors (p=0.0006). For pattern cutting, subjects reported a significantly lower perception of failure (p=0.0479) in both the positive evaluative (mean=8.5556) and post-test conditions (mean=8.222), yet, though not statistically significant (p=0.0564), the measured accuracy in the task during the positive evaluative condition was actually worse (33.3%), second only to the pre-test accuracy (31.1%). The best accuracy for pattern cutting across all expertise levels was 62% for the post-test followed by 54.4% in the negative evaluative condition. These results are interesting as they show that despite perceived improvements in performance with a positive feedback condition, performance actually degrades and is better in the negative feedback condition, which is perceived to be more difficult. These results were not found in the peg transfer task, which is arguably an easier task. Conclusion: From the evidence gathered in the study, it is clear that there is a correlation between distractors and performance. Further analysis is needed to identify the relationship between the type of stressor, and inherent difficulty of the tasks, in terms of which type of stressor best improves learning and outcomes.",

One continues to teach ERCP to general surgery residents, and another taught the skill to fellows in an advanced endoscopy fellowship. All three continue to use ERCP in their practice (2 to 5 times per month), as they each specialized in a field that utilizes ERCP routinely. Choledocholothiaisis is the most frequent indication, though ERCP is also performed for iatrogenic biliary duct leaks, traumatic biliary or pancreatic duct leaks, chronic pancreatitis, and malignancy. Conclusions: Training in esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy is required for general surgery residents, but the addition of ERCP to select residents' training enables them to completely manage their patients' surgical disease. The training of select general surgery residents in this skill has been successful, evidenced by the continued use of ERCP in the practices of three residents who completed this training program at our institution. The decision to train residents in this skill should be left to individual program directors and department chairs. We recommend that residents selected for this additional training should plan to practice in specialties where ERCP can be implemented. Conclusion: Same-day discharge after Nissen fundoplication and hiatal hernia repair is feasible for select patients. One major challenge for same day discharge is the current insurance provisions required for hospital reimbursement.

Enhanced recovery program (ERP) synonym \"fast track\" surgery \"was first conceived by Dr Henrich Kelhet. Largely described for colorectal surgery and reported to be feasible and useful for maintaining physiological function and smooth the progress of recovery. Most of the patients who present for surgical emergency are not adequately prepared and many are not in normal physiological state. The feasibility of Enhanced recovery programs protocol in such emergency minimal access surgery remains indistinct. This study was designed to validate an Enhanced recovery program in patients who undergo emergency minimal access surgery. Introduction: Pathways for enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) have been shown to improve length of stay and postoperative complication rates across various surgical fields, however there is a relative lack of evidence-based studies in bariatric surgery. The objective of the current study was to determine if starting a bariatric full liquid diet on postoperative day (POD) zero was associated with shorter length of stay (LOS) for patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB). Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively collected dataset was conducted at a single institution before and after implementation of a new diet protocol for LSG and RYGB. Postoperative diet orders were changed from full liquid diet on POD 1 to POD 0. Length of stay and 30-day readmissions were reviewed from June 2016 to August 2017. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables before and after diet change was implemented. Patients were excluded if they were undergoing revision surgery, were discharged directly from PACU, or had significant intraoperative complications or required reoperation within the same admission. Introduction: Data suggests value in using TAP (transversus abdominis plane) neural blockade in abdominal surgical procedures. We deploy TAP blockade using liposomal bupivacaine via ultrasound (US) as part of a narcotic sparing pain management pathway for patients undergoing abdominal surgery in our rural community setting. Our goal was to evaluate adequacy of postoperative discomfort and the success in avoiding narcotic usage. Methods and Procedures: Records of patients undergoing abdominal surgical procedures performed by one surgeon over an 18 month period were reviewed under IRB approval. Patients taking narcotics prior to the procedure (except for discomfort due to the condition being surgically treated) were excluded from analysis, as were those admitted to the hospital for postoperative treatment. US guided lateral TAP blocks were performed by the surgeon using 266 mg of liposomal bupivacaine and 50 mg of bupivacaine in the OR prior to the incision. Unilateral block was performed for unilateral procedures (e.g. inguinal hernia) and bilateral for laparoscopic or midline procedures. Incisional sites were treated with a field block of 50 mg of bupivacaine. Prescriptions for medications included 1,000 mg of acetaminophen QID and 220 mg of naproxen sodium TID for 7 days. A prescription for tramadol (50 to 100 mg PRN up to 4 times daily; 40 tablets with no refill) was given. Patients were seen in followup two weeks postoperatively. ",

Effective management of post-operative pain has long been recognised as important in improving the post-operative experience, reducing complications and promoting early discharge from hospital. Standards: all patients should be pain free at rest, 100% of elective patients should be told about what analgesia they will have post-operatively, 100% of patients should be satisfied with their pain management and 100% of patients should feel staff did everything they could to control their pain. Methods and Procedures: Questionnaires were given to 20 patients on the day prior to discharge. 13 questions about pre-operative and post-operative pain experience were asked. Data regarding post-operative analgesia were collected from medication charts and medical notes. Data were collected over a period of two months (August/September 2017). Range of procedures: 4 elective laparoscopic abdomino-perineal-excision-of-rectum with IGAP flaps, 1 elective laparoscopic right hemicholectomy, 7 laparotomy+bowel resection/stoma formation (5 elective, 2 emergency), 1 elective repair of parastomal hernia, 5 appendicectomy (2 laparoscopic elective, 2 laparoscopic emergency, 1 laparotomy emergency) and 2 elective reversal of ileosomy.

Methods and Procedures: A patient undergoing a standard ultrasound guided QL3 block by an anesthesiologist established the baseline anticipated response, and procedure time. The procedure, performed under sedation preoperatively, required over 60 minutes. For this study, patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery were administered a lateral QL block (modified QL 1) under ultrasound guidance by the operating surgeon. 40 ml of a mixture (10 ml injectable liposomal bupivacaine suspension, 15 ml 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride and 15 ml normal saline) was injected bilaterally, after induction, skin preparation, draping, and prior to the operation. Postoperative narcotic use and pain VAS scores were documented. Results: Six patients were administered a bi-lateral QL block intraoperatively. Procedures were: 3 laparoscopic sigmoid colectomies, one end ileostomy reversal, laparoscopic completion proctectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis, and a laparoscopic descending colectomy. Of the narcotic na\u00efve patients, mean pain VAS on post op days 0, 1 and 2 were 4.5, 3.2 and 2.3 respectively within a multimodality pain management/enhanced recovery program, where standing orders prompting narcotic administration by nursing staff is pain VAS 5. All were discharged on POD 2 or 3 without narcotic prescriptions. Two of the 6 patients were chronic narcotic users, and they were discharged on their baseline narcotics, i.e. without additional narcotics. All intraoperative blocks were performed in less than 20 minutes. Conclusion: A novel, surgeon-administered lateral QL block under ultrasound guidance, is feasible and provides post-operative pain control. Patients are discharged home on no/baseline narcotics.

Background: The \"Opioid Crisis\" has taken over headlines with increasing public attention brought to the drastically increasing rates of addiction to prescription narcotics. In 2015, the American Society of Addiction Medicine reported 2 million Americans with an addiction to prescription pain relievers and a four-fold increase in overdose related deaths. In a medical setting, increased opiate use is associated with increased rates of delirium, ileus, urinary retention, and respiratory depression. These risks are increased in the obese/bariatric population. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a safe and effective approach to achieve optimum pain control. It reduces the use of opiates in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. However, there is currently no data in the literature examining its use in the bariatric population. Our study examines the use of liposomal bupivacaine for TAP block in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Methods: Sixteen patients undergoing LSG with TAP block were compared with historical cohort of sixteen patients undergoing LSG without TAP block (standard group). The primary outcome measured was post-operative in-hospital opiate use (morphine equivalents). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.",

This can be an important adjunct in pain control for the bariatric population and aid in post-operative complication risk reduction. Introduction: The objective of this study was to identify variation in weight and demographics in the distribution of pre-operative clinical characteristics between super obese females compared with males who were about to undergo BPD/DS surgery. As the American obesity epidemic increases, morbidly obese patients have become integral to every surgical practice; they are no longer limited to bariatric surgeons. Every clinical insight helps the surgeon to optimize outcomes when operating on and managing these medically fragile individuals. In this context, however, clinically and statistically significant differences in demographics, body mass, and in the distribution of weight-related medical problems between super-obese women and men are unknown. Introduction: A transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is an ultrasound-guided injection of local anesthetic in the plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles to interrupt innervation to the abdominal skin, muscles, and parietal peritoneum. Currently there are incongruent findings on the benefit of this regional anesthetic to surgical patients, particularly the obese population. We hypothesized the addition of a TAP block in an enhanced recovery pathway (ERAS) for bariatric patients would decrease opioid use and shorten hospital length of stay.",

The primary outcome was time to first opioid (min) and total morphine (mg) equivalents in PACU. Objective: Prolonged postoperative ileus increases hospital length of stay and therefore impacts healthcare costs. Although many surgeons recommend ambulation in the postoperative period to hasten return of bowel function, little evidence exists to support this practice. Our hypothesis is that early ambulation does reduce the time to return of bowel function after intestinal surgery.",

Patients were included in this study if they underwent an operation on the small bowel, colon, or rectum. Resolution of postoperative ileus was defined as the postoperative day when patients were noted to meet all of the following criteria on review of nursing documentation: passing flatus, stooling or having ostomy output, and tolerating a regular diet without intravenous fluids. \"Early\" postoperative activity was defined as the average number of daily steps during the first two postoperative days. Discussion: These results suggest the patients who received an intraoperative block laparoscopically were more likely to be able to spend less time in the post anesthesia care unit and be discharged home the same day. Based on these results, additional process improvement ideas will be implemented in an attempt to improve outcomes.",

In many stenotic or spastic disorders of the GEJ 20 mm is just not big enough. Larger balloon sizes are available (30 and 40 mm), although these are deployed under fluoroscopy without endoscopy. Thus, these larger dilations are often not feasible at the time of the diagnostic endoscopy because different facilities and/or equipment are needed. Also, fluoroscopic 30 mm balloon dilations are associated with a 5 percent perforation rate. To address these shortcomings we present an experience with a retroflexed \"against the scope\" balloon dilation of the GEJ. In detail, the GEJ is visualized while retroflexed and a balloon is then placed through the scope. The GEJ is cannulated next to the scope and deployed. Please see the attached image for example.",

The role of endoscopy across surgical subspecialties is shifting, as endolumenal procedures (like per-oral endoscopic myotomy and endolumenal bariatric interventions) have become commonplace. While surgical residency minimum case volumes are mandated, little is known about the volume of endoscopic procedures surgical fellows participate in. We aimed to characterize the volume of flexible endoscopy cases logged by surgical subspecialty fellows as a measure of endoscopic platform use by surgeons. Methods: Operative case logs for fellows enrolled in post-graduate training programs participating in The Fellowship Council were de-identified (no patient or program specific information) and provided for analysis. The case log is an online, mandatory, self-reported collection of all surgeries, procedures and endoscopies performed during fellowship year. All cases listed within the category of \"GI Endoscopy\" in which the fellow designated their role as \"Primary\" surgeon for the procedure were further sorted based on subcategory and linked to the year of fellowship graduation. Rigid endoscopy, trans-anal endoscopic procedures, and those in which the fellows roll was \"First Assistant\" were excluded.

We present the first reported case series of four patients presenting with external penetrating trauma induced esophageal injuries, complicated by failure of initial primary surgical repair and leak development, successfully managed with the use of esophageal stents. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was performed at a Level I trauma center identifying four patients who underwent endoscopically placed removable covered metal stents, either by a surgical endoscopist or an interventional gastroenterologist, after failure of primary surgical repair of esophageal traumatic injuries. Demographic information, hospital stay, additional interventions, complications, imaging studies, ISS scores, and outcomes were collected. Results: Our cohort consisted of 4 patients with penetrating injuries to the chest and neck with esophageal injuries (3 thoracic and 1 cervical esophageal injuries) managed with esophageal stenting after leaks were diagnosed following primary surgical repair. Their initial esophageal injuries included grades 1, 3 and 5. Leaks were diagnosed on average post-operative day 9. Two patients underwent an additional attempted surgical repair and subsequent leak development. Esophageal stents were placed under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance within 3 days of leak diagnosis. There was resolution of their esophageal fistulas with all patients resuming oral intake (averaging 72 days after stent placement). Three patients (75%) required further endoscopic interventions to adjust the stent due to migration or for dilations due to strictures. Mortality was 0%, all patients survived to be discharged from the hospital with average ICU length of stay of 30 days.",

            "text": "Results of the Ovesco-Over-Overstitch Technique for Managing Bariatric Surgical Complications Introduction: Since 1980, the preferred method of enteral access has been the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube (PEG). Accidental removal is a common complication associated with excessive cost and possible significant morbidity. Removal prior to 14 days is considered ''early removal.'' Early removal has more significant risk associated with it, and can necessitate emergent operation to prevent peritonitis and sepsis. Some patients, who do not exhibit signs of peritonitis, may be simply observed. For these patients, PEG replacement would typically be delayed 5-10 days to ensure closure. This delay results in prolonged NPO status and worsened nutritional status. Presented below is a case of early accidental removal followed by endoscopic clip closure, and immediate PEG replacement. Case Report: A 43-year-old male presented after a large left middle cerebral artery infarct. A PEG placement was completed without complication. Eleven hours after the procedure the patient had pulled the PEG tube out of the abdominal wall. At this time the patient appeared to have no abdominal pain and no signs of peritonitis. Twelve hours following the accidental removal of his PEG tube, the patient was taken back to the endoscopy suite, and an EGD was performed. The previous PEG site was identified and appeared closed and ulcerated. The mucosal defect was closed with two endoscopic metallic clips. A PEG tube was then placed at an adjacent site.",

Discussion: We propose that in the case of early accidental PEG removal, the patient should be examined first for evidence of peritonitis. If initial physical exam and radiographic investigation do not reveal peritonitis or significant pneumoperitoneum, the patient should undergo urgent repeat endoscopy. At this time, the gastrotomy can be closed endoscopically via metallic clips and PEG can be replaced immediately. Tube feeds can be initiated after a 12-24 hour period of dependent drainage with serial abdominal exams. Introduction: Since its inception in 2008, POEM has become a viable procedure for the treatment of achalasia and esophageal dysmotility disorders. However many institutions are in the beginning stages of implementing the procedure into their programs. In view of training, we report the successful ability to dissect and identify common landmarks during a POEM procedure performed by trainees under supervision in a high volume POEM center. Methods: 23 posterior POEM procedures performed by trainees with experienced proctor guidance during the period between February to July 2017 were evaluated for the frequency of identifying the 2 perforating vessels, the presence of sling fibers, and position on the lesser curvature of stomach evaluated by double scoping method during the creation of the tunnel and myotomy for procedure.",

Indication for procedure included 13 patients with Type 1 achalasia (56%), 9 with Type 2 achalasia (40%) and 1 DES (4%). Average length of myotomy for all procedures was 10.4 cm. During these procedures 1 or 2 perforator vessels were identified in 11 (48%) of patients, sling muscle was identified in 10 patients (43%) of patients. Myotomy extended to anterior lesser curvature of stomach on double scope exam in 100% of patients. No patient had a serious complication requiring intervention. Conclusion: Trainees performing a posterior POEM procedure were able to correctly dissect and identify the sling muscle and/or perforating vessels in approximately 48% and 40% respectively of procedures. However the myotomy position was correctly placed in all procedures. This indicates that while ideally the sling fibers and perforating vessels should be identified, a correctly positioned myotomy can still be successfully performed by trainees without identification of these landmarks. Introduction: Gastroparesis is a rapidly increasing problem with sometimes devestating patient consequenses. Surgical treatments, particularly laparoscopic pyloroplasty, have recently gained popularity but require general anesthesia, advanced skills and create risk of leaks. Peroral Pyloromyotomy (POP) is a less invasive alternative but is technically demanding and not widely available. We propose an hybrid laparo-endoscopic collaborative approach using a novel gastric access device to allow a endoluminal stapled pyloroplasty as an alternative treatment option for functional gastric outlet obstruction. Methods and Procedures: Under general anesthesia six female pigs (mean weight 33 kg) had endoscopic placement of 2 or 3 5 mm intragastric ports (TAGGS, Kansas, USA) using a technique similar to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. A 5 mm laparoscope was used for visualization. EndoFLIP (Crospon, Inc., Galway, Ireland) was used to measure cross sectional area (CSA) and compliance of the pylorus before intervention, immediately after and at 1 week survival. Pyloroplasty was performed using a 5 mm articulating laparoscopic stapler (Dextera MicroCutter). After removing the TAGGS ports, the gastrotomies were closed by either endoscopic clip, endoscopic suture or suture under laparoscopic vision. The animals were survived for 1 week. After 6-8 days, a second laparo-endoscopic procedure was performed to verify healing of the pyloroplasty as well as intraluminal dimensions. At the end of the protocol, animals were euthanized.",

            "text": "Introduction: A presacral phlegmon is a contained collection of infected fluid and inflammation within the bony pelvis, posterior to the rectum and anterior to the sacrum, that usually arises as a complication of surgery, malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis or perforated viscous. Symptoms include low-back pain, pelvic pain and fevers. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are the mainstay of treatment. However, if abscess develops, drainage is required usually by trans-gluteal percutaneous and/or surgical methods, both of which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) -guided drainage of perirectal and presacral abscesses is a well described minimally-invasive approach that permits clear definition of anatomy, real-time access to the abscess and creation of an internalized fistula through placement of one or more transluminal stents. However, to date there is no published report describing endoscopic treatment of the more complicated, clinically challenging presacral phlegmon. Here we present a case of a symptomatic presacral phlegmon recalcitrant to medical management that was successfully treated with an endoscopically placed retrievable, transmural, lumen-apposing metal stent. Case Report: This is a case-report of a 21-year-old, post-partum female who presented with fevers and recurrent lower back pain radiating to her rectum and vagina. Her spontaneous vaginal delivery was notable for a second-degree laceration that was primarily repaired at the time of delivery 3 months prior to presentation. Her past medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Radiographic imaging revealed several perirectal and presacral abscesses that were considered too small for percutaneous drainage. IV antibiotics were started and the largest abscess was targeted for EUSguided aspiration. Unfortunately, her pain became constant and progressed in severity. A follow-up MRI a week later revealed a 7-cm presacral phlegmon.",

Introduction: Flexible endoscopy has evolved to include multiple endoluminal procedures such as anti-reflux procedures, pyloromyotomy, and mucosal and submucosal tumor resections. However, these remain technically demanding procedures as they are hindered by the state of flexible technology which has difficult imaging, limited energy devices, no staplers, and cumbersome suturing abilities. An alternative approach is transgastric laparoscopy, which for almost 2 decades has been shown to be a good procedure for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage and full-thickness and mucosal resection of various lesions. We propose to expand the indications of transgastric laparoscopy by using novel endoscopically placed transgastric laparoscopy ports (TAGGS, Kansa, USA) to replicate endoscopic procedures such as endoluminal antireflux surgery. Methods and Procedures: Under general anesthesia 5 female pigs (mean weight 27.6 kg) had endoscopic placement of 3 5 mm-intragastric ports (TAGGS, Kansas, USA) using a technique similar to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. A 5 mm laparoscope was used for visualization. EndoFLIP, (Crospon, Inc., Galway, Ireland) was used to measure cross sectional area (CSA) and compliance of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) before and after intervention. Laparoendoscopic-assited suture plication of the GEJ was performed using 3-0 sutures (Polysorb\u00ae). Once the TAGGS ports were removed, the gastrotomies were closed by using endoscopic clip.

The mean operative time was 65,6 min (Endoscopic Evaluation: 3.2 min, TAGSS Insertion: 11 min, EndoFLIP Evaluation+ GEJ Plication: 43,25 min, Gastric Wall Closure: 15 min). In all cases, this technique was effective in achieving adequate GEJ plication. Median GEJ diameter (D) and median cross-sectional area (CSA) pre-plication were 11.42 mm (8.6-13.6 mm) and 104.8 mm 2 (58-146 mm 2 ). After the procedure, these values were decreased to 6.14 mm (5.7-6.6 mm) and 29.8 mm 2 (25-34 mm 2 ) respectively (p=0,0079). Median distensibility (d) and median compliance (C) pre-plication were 7.87 mm 2 /mmHg (2.4-22 .69 mm 2 /mmHg) and 190.56 mm 3 /mmHg (70,9-502,8 mm 3 /mmHg). After the procedure, these values were decreased to 1,5 mm 2 /mmHg (0.7-2.2 mm 2 /mmHg) and 52.17 mm 3 /mmHg (21.9-98.7 mm 3 /mmHg) respectively (p=0,0317). No intraoperative events were observed. Conclusion: A hybrid laparoendoscopic approach is a feasible alternative for performing intragastric procedures with the assistance of conventional laparoscopic instruments; especially in cases where the location of the intervention limits the access of standard endoscopy or where endoscopic technology is inadequate. Further evaluation is planned in survival models and clinical trials. Introduction: Due to previous manipulation or submucosal invasion, colonic lesions referred for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) frequently have flat areas of visible tissue that cannot be snared. Current methods for treating residual tissue may lead to incomplete eradication or not allow complete tissue sampling for histologic evaluation. Our aim is to describe Dissection-enabled SCaffold Assisted Resection (DeSCAR): A new technique combining circumferential ESD with EMR for removal of superficial non-lifting or residual \"islands\" with suspected submucosal involvement/fibrosis. Methods: From 2015 to 2017, lesions referred for EMR were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were identified where lifting and/or snaring of the lesion was incomplete and the DeSCAR technique was undertaken. Cases were reviewed for location, prior manipulation, rates of successful hybrid resection and adverse events. Results: 29 lesions underwent DeSCAR due to non-lifting or residual \"islands\" of tissue. Patients were 52% M, 48% F, and average age 66 (SD \u00b1 9.9 yrs). Lesions were located in the cecum (n= 10), right colon (n=12), left colon (n=4) and rectum (n=3). Average size was 31 mm (SD \u00b1 20.6 mm). Previous manipulation occurred in 28/29 cases (83% biopsy, 34% resection attempt, 52% tattoo). The technical success rate for resection of non-lifting lesions was 100%. There was one delayed bleeding episode but no other adverse events. Approximately 22% of patients have been followed up endoscopically to date with no evidence of residual adenoma.",

Background: Colonoscopy is the most commonly performed endoscopic examination worldwide and is considered the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening. The quality of examination and endoscopic treatment is affected by a number of factors that are verified by recognized parameters such as cecal intubation rate and time (CIR, CIT), withdrawal time, adenoma detection rate (ADR) and polyp detection rate (PDR). Advanced endoscopic imaging improves accurate recognition of the nature and variety of pathologic lesions, while the endoscope tips, third eye retroscope and wide-angle endoscopy allow detection of lesions located on the proximal side of the intestinal folds. The aim of the study was to assess the suitability of wide-angle colonoscopy for the detection of colorectal lesions and to analyze the functionality of a special endoscope series regarding CIR, CIT and withdrawal time. Introduction: Leak is an uncommon but serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery. When identified post-operatively, percutaneous drains are used to manage abscesses and prevent further peritoneal contamination. If drain position is suboptimal, however, the consequences of persistent leak may necessitate a formal surgical intervention in a hostile abdomen. In select situations, we have utilized natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) methods to enter the abdominal cavity and place/reposition drains under direct endoscopic visualization a part of our comprehensive endoscopic management algorithm for leaks. Methods and Procedures: A prospectively collected database was queried for patients who had undergone transluminal endoscopic drain repositioning (TEDR) as part of multimodal endolumenal therapy for leak (including interventions like defect closure, enteral feeding access, or endolumenal stent placement). Inadequate drainage was identified pre-procedurally by undrained fluid collections in conjunction with clinical signs of sepsis. Translumenal access was obtained via the leak site and carbon dioxide insufflation was used in all cases. The peritoneal cavity was surveilled and cleared of gross debris by irrigation and suction. Intraabdominal drains were located endoscopically and fluoroscopically, grasped with an endoscopic snare or grasper and repositioned adjacent to the leak site to ensure better drainage.",

Two patients developed leak following revisional bariatric surgery. One patient had an acutely dislodged gastrostomy tube with intraperitoneal leak after multiple laparotomies recently closed with a granulating vicryl mesh. One patient developed a leak at an esophagojejunostomy following total gastrectomy. Three patients had adequate drainage after the initial TEDR, while one patient required TEDR on two occasions. All patients had improved drainage demonstrated by resolution of clinical signs of sepsis and resolution of fluid collections. Drains were removed as clinically indicated. Conclusion: Intraabdominal drains are an essential element in the management of full-thickness gastrointestinal leaks, but are not always able to be adequately positioned percutaneously. Transluminal endoscopic drain repositioning via a gastrointestinal defect is a viable option to avoid surgical intervention in an otherwise hostile field and is a novel practical NOTES application. Background: Epiphrenic diverticula (ED) arise from increased intraluminal pressures, often secondary to achalasia or another underlying esophageal motility disorder which causes \"pulsion\" physiology. ED are traditionally thought to contribute to patients' symptoms of regurgitation and dysphagia, and are frequently resected at time of Heller myotomy and fundoplication done for treatment of the primary motility disorder. ED excision carries significant risks (staple line leak, pulmonary complications, mortality), and little is known regarding patients with ED and esophageal motility disorder who undergo surgical myotomy without ED resection. The goal of this study was to compare outcomes of patients with ED and esophageal motility disorder who did and did not undergo diverticulectomy at time of myotomy and fundoplication.",

Introduction: Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS) has been described in the literature as presenting with a constellation of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and post-prandial epigastric pain. While many of these symptoms are consistent with foregut pathology, a cohort of patients with MALS presenting with delayed gastric emptying has not been described in the literature. In this study we report on the possible association of MALS with delayed gastric emptying. Methods: Cases of MAL release were collected between 2013 and 2017. Eight patients were identified who presented with MALS and underwent subsequent MAL release. All 8 patients underwent laparoscopic or robotic surgery. Patients were compiled into a retrospective database and their demographic, symptomatic, imaging, and outcomes data were analyzed. Background: Laparoscopic fundoplication (LF) is often performed to treat paraesophageal hernia and/or GERD. Care is taken to select the right patients for the operation. Some patients may not improve, and others experience dysphagia or bloating after surgery. Factors associated with patient satisfaction after fundoplication would be helpful during the patient selection process. Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed. Queried patients underwent LF from 2009 to 2015. Non-elective operations and fundoplications after heller myotomy were excluded. Of this cohort, patients were included only if they responded to a two-year postoperative quality of life survey. Surveys were distributed preoperatively, at three weeks, at one year, and at two years. The surveys include the Reflux Severity Index, GERD-HRQL, and Dysphagia Score. The GERD-HRQL asks about patient satisfaction with their current state (1 = dissatisfied, 2 = somewhat satisfied, 3 = very satisfied). The cohort was divided according to their answer to this question at two years. Demographics and preoperative factors were compared between the groups with Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's Exact tests. Univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression was performed to identify preoperative symptoms associated with satisfaction at two years. Scores on the surveys over time were were also analyzed.",

The majority of resections were wedge or partial resections, performed using endoscopic steplers or using ultrasound scissors followed by double-suturing of gatro/duodenotomy. In the cases of tumor location on the posterior gastric wall we mobilized the the greater curvature to get a direct approach to the tumor with extraluminal growth.

Three patients (2 males 1 female) with diagnosis of terminal achalasia and 1 stenosis secondary to caustic ingestion consulted at the minimal invasion service Fundcacion Valle del Lili. They were schedualed for minimal invasive three fields esophagectomy, one patient without complications and early discharge (5 postoperative day) but occasional dysphagia, the other two required early reintubation after de surgery with ARDS, 1 patient requiered tracheostomy, the second patient could be extubated after 2 days but with occasional dysphagia. All three had mild hoarseness after surgery. The patient who required tracheostomy was decannulated at 20 days without complication. Results: The three patients underwent endoscopy without complication in the cervical anastomosis stenosis or disorder in the emptying of the gastric tube, swallowing study without alteration and laryngoscopy with paralysis of the left vocal cord. These patients went to speech therapy with total paralysis recovery at 6 months corroborated with laryngoscopy, without dysphagia or hoarseness. Conclusion: RNL innervates the larynx and upper esophageal sphincter, therefore lesion or paresis causes symptoms such as hoarseness, dysphagia, difficulty swallowing, aspiration, difficulty in coughing, pneumonia and ARDS. Injury has a predecessor factor in pulmonary complications and prolongation of the hospital stay. 14% of these patients may require some surgical procedure to restore the function of RNL.

Epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum are a rare disorder believed to result from increased intraesophageal pressure often in conjunction with a motility disorder causing functional outflow obstruction. They are a pulsion-type pseudo-diverticulum with mucosal bulging most frequently from the right posterior esophageal wall (2) . We present a very rare case of achalasia associated with multiple esophageal diverticula successfully treated with laparoscopic Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication. Case Presentation: A 75 year old woman presented with 4 years of dysphagia, chest discomfort, regurgitation, and weight loss. Esophagoscopy showed a patulous esophagus with multiple esophageal diverticula (Figure 1 ). Barium esophogram demonstrated 5 esophageal diverticula in the distal esophagus and delayed clearance of esophageal contrast (Figure 2 ). High resolution monometry revealed a hypertensive mean LES, an aperistaltic body on 10 of 10 wet swallows, and panesophageal pressurization in 7 of 10 wet swallows -consistent with Type II Achalasia by Chicago classification (1). We performed a laparoscopic Heller Myotomy with Dor fundoplication. The myotomy was extended 6 cm above the gasgtroesophageal junction and 3 cm onto the gastric cardia. An anterior diaphragmatic defect with a moderate type 1 hiatal hernia was repaired with two sutures, ensuring to not impinge the esophagus (Figure 3 ). At 10 weeks post operatively the patient reports excellent results. Her dysphagia and chest discomfort have entirely resolved. Her Eckhardt score improved from seven preoperatively to one post operatively. Discussion: Type II Achalasia is successfully treated in the majority of cases with laparoscopic Heller myotomy and partial fundoplication (3). However, esophageal diverticula typically require both myotomy as well as diverticulectomy for successful treatment (4) . There is little experience with the surgical management of multiple esophageal diverticula. We propose a two stage surgical approach for these patients. We reason that the risk of esophageal leak or stenosis in the case of multiple esophageal diverticulectomies out weighs the proposed benefit. Indeed epidemiologic studies indicate that the majority of esophageal diverticula are asymptomatic (4) . In the event the patient remains symptomatic after myotomy a second stage operation with diverticulectomies would be possible. This single experience suggests that diverticulectomy may not be necessary in the case of multiple diverticula associated with Achalasia. Instead, treatment may be directed at relieving the functional obstruction responsible for the symptoms by performing laparoscopic Heller Myotomy with Dor fundoplication.",

Synthetic mesh use poses a risk of erosion but there is no evidence that non-synthetic mesh is useful to minimize the risk of hernia recurrence.

Consequently, reoperation is expected to increase in frequency. Published data on the outcomes of recurrent paraesophageal hernia (RPEH) repair is very limited. Because of the technical difficulties of revisional surgery, we hypothesize that laparoscopic revisional paraesophageal hernia repairs are associated with high perioperative morbidity and poor patient outcomes. Methods: All RPEH repairs performed by the foregut surgical service at our institution from 2012 to 2015 were reviewed. Patients were included if their index operation was a true PEHR (initial type 1 hiatal hernia repairs were excluded, as well as multiply recurrent hernias). Demographics, medical and surgical history, and operative notes from the index surgery were reviewed. Details from standardized pre-operative symptom assessment, objective testing and operative details for the revisional surgery were collected. Patients were routinely offered 12 month post-operative upper gastrointestinal contrast evaluation. Postoperative outcomes included a standardized symptom assessment and results of objective testing at any time after surgery. Results: Twenty six patients were identified who underwent repair of RPEH. Demographic, operative and perioperative data was available for all patients (Table 1) . Twenty four patients underwent followup symptom evaluation (two were lost to follow-up after the initial hospitalization). Sixteen patients underwent follow-up objective testing by radiographic evaluation with contrast, endoscopy or both. These subgroups were used to calculate symptomatic and objective outcomes (Table 1) . Conclusion: Reoperative laparoscopic surgery for recurrent paraesophageal hernias is technically challenging as evidenced by long operative times. Despite this, perioperative outcomes at a high volume center are good, with low morbidity and no mortality. Importantly, symptomatic outcomes for this difficult problem are excellent. Introduction: Hypotension of the lower esophageal sphincter (hLES) and the presence of hiatal hernia (HH) have both been associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The exact likelihood with which a hLES or a hiatal hernia predict GERD continues to be defined. We hypothesize a synergistic interaction in those with hLES and HH in predicting GERD as defined by a positive pH study. Methods and Procedures: Between 2012 and 2013, 148 consecutive patients presenting to a surgical practice with symptoms most concerning for GERD, without prior antireflux surgery were evaluated by high resolution manometry (HRM), esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), videoesophagography (VEG) and an ambulatory pH study. hLES was defined as residual LES pressure of\\15 mmHg, HH was defined as having been noted and measured by the radiologist, these were further categorized into any HH, 1-3 cm, [3-5 cm Background: While clinical outcomes have been reported for antireflux surgery, there is limited data on postoperative outpatient encounters and their associated costs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the utilization of healthcare and its associated costs during the 90-day postoperative period following antireflux surgery. Methods: We analyzed data from the Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases. Patients \u226516 years with an ICD-9 procedure code or CPT code for antireflux surgery and a primary diagnosis of GERD during 2012-2014 were selected. Only patients with continuous enrollment six months prior to the date of surgery and 90-days after surgery were analyzed. Patients with a diagnosis of esophageal cancer or achalasia during the six-month period prior to antireflux surgery, a length of stay [ 30 days following index procedure, a capitated plan, or patients who underwent emergency surgery were excluded. Outpatient endoscopy was defined using ICD-9 and CPT codes, and related readmission was defined by clinical classification software. Introduction: The development of postsurgical gastroparesis following Nissen fundoplication is poorly understood. In this study, we analyze the development of gastroparesis requiring intervention and other subsequent procedures following fundoplication and paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repair procedures in the state of New York. Methods: Using a comprehensive state-wide administrative database (SPARCS), we examined all in-patient and outpatient records for adult patients who underwent fundoplication or PEH repair as a primary procedure for the treatment of GERD between the years of 2005-2010. Patients with an initial gastroparesis diagnosis were excluded from the analysis. Through the use of a unique identifier, each patient was followed until 2015 for the subsequent diagnosis of gastroparesis or reoperation. Surgical procedures for the treatment of gastroparesis included pyloroplasty, pyloromyotomy, or gastroenterostomy procedures. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors for having subsequent reoperation.",

In the fundoplication group, 388 (9.80%) patients had a follow-up diagnosis of gastroparesis or secondary procedure. 211 (8.52%) of the patients who underwent a primary PEH repair procedure had a follow-up procedure or gastroparesis diagnosis (Table 1) . Mean time to follow-up procedure or diagnosis was 2.81 years for the fundoplication group and 2.16 years for the PEH repair group. The majority of the follow-up procedures in the fundoplication group were revisional procedures (fundoplication or PEH repair) (n = 254, 6.41%), while 134 (3.38%) patients were newly diagnosed with gastroparesis and/or underwent a secondary procedure for its treatment. Conclusion: Fundoplication and PEH repair procedures have a relatively low post-operative incidence of gastroparesis following initial procedure for treatment of GERD. Secondary fundoplication or PEH repair was more commonly performed compared to any of the surgical procedures for gastroparesis for both procedures. Further analysis of association with subsequent procedures is needed. During this procedure, gastro-esophageal reflux was evaluated and assigned to severe, moderate and slight category. If the reflux was observed slightly up to cervical esophagus, the case was assigned to moderate category. If the reflux was observed intensely up to cervical esophagus, the position was returned to head high position for the safety and the case was assigned to severe category. The anti-reflux surgery was considered in the moderate and severe categories. Results: We have performed laparoscopic Nissen procedure in 87 cases. The mean operation time was 115 min. The outcome was assessed by Reflux Test performed on 4-5 postoperative day, and the results showed the reflux was disappeared in every cases. Median follow-up period of this study was 38 months (7-95 months). In 13 cases (14.9%) PPI was restarted before 6 months after the anti-reflux surgery. In 25 cases (28.7%) PPI was restarted after the anti-reflux surgery during the whole follow-up period of this study. The BMI of the patients had no relationship to the needed restart of PPI.",

Disadvantages include fundoplication specific complications, might be unnecessary and may not decrease recurrence. We retrospectively reviewed giant paraesophageal hernia repairs (PEH) with two point gastropexy in the fundus and body, and no antireflux procedure. Data collected is postoperative GERD symptoms, postoperative Proton Pump inhibitors (PPIs) therapy and recurrence. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent repair of giant PEH from 2012 to December of 2016. Giant was defined as a hernia with 50% or more of the stomach above the diaphragm. Follow up consisted of upper GI (UGI) study one year postoperatively and reflux symptom questionnaire. Patients were followed every 4 months in the surgery clinic and a PPI wean was initiated at the second postoperative visit. The primary outcome we evaluated was discontinuation of PPIs. In addition, we utilized a standardized reflux scale and recurrence rates collected. Chi-Squared was used for statistical analysis. Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a highly prevalent disorder with a multitude of treatment options ranging from lifestyle modifications and medical management to surgical options. Despite the numerous treatments available, there is still debate over which approach is most appropriate and effective for patients. This study aims to examine the effect of robotic hiatal hernia repair (RHHR) with the novel addition of esophagopexy in patients with GERD. Methods: A single institution, single surgeon, prospectively maintained database was used to identify patients who underwent RHHR with a partial fundoplication and concomitant esophagopexy for GERD from November 2015 to July 2017. Patient characteristics, operative details and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Primary endpoint was resolution of subjective GERD symptoms and discontinuation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Recurrence of hiatal hernia was a secondary endpoint. Results: Eleven patients were identified meeting the inclusion criteria (RHHR + esophagopexy) with a mean follow-up of 9.5 weeks \u00b1 19.4 weeks. In regards to the RHHR, 91% underwent a partial fundoplication and the additional 9% underwent a re-do wrap. This patient cohort was 81.8% female with a mean age of 61.5 \u00b1 11.9 years. Preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 100% of patients with the study showing a hiatal hernia in 91.0%, gastritis in 45.4% and esophagitis in 63.6% of patients. Manometry was performed in 54.5% of the patients showing 50% of these patients with esophageal dysmotility. Esophagograms and pH studies were performed preoperatively in 36.4% and 45.5% of patients respectively. Preoperatively, 100% of patients had a documented diagnosis of GERD and were taking a PPI and/or H2 blocker. After RHHR with esophagopexy, 81.8% of patients had resolution of their GERD symptoms while 18.2% (n = 2) remained symptomatic. However, one of two patients reported a subjective decrease in symptom severity following the procedure. Despite resolution of symptoms, 81.1% remained on PPIs. Another 9% switched to H2 blockers and one patient discontinued all antisecretory therapy. None of the patients experienced recurrence of their hiatal hernia. Conclusion: Based on our data, RHHR with esophagopexy results in resolution GERD symptoms in over 80% of symptomatic patient. In patients with hiatal hernias and GERD, RHHR with esophagopexy does lead to resolution of symptoms, however, the majority of patients remained on PPIs. Long-term follow up is needed to investigate whether these patients are able to discontinue PPIs and remain symptom free.",

Hiatial paraconduit hernias are rare complications following esophagectomy. In this study, we review our experience with these rare diaphragmatic hernias. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all patients presenting with hiatial hernia after esophageal resection at the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center between 2014 and 2017 was performed. Data was abstracted from the medical record for evaluation and included demographics, symptoms, repair techniques and outcomes. No patients were excluded. Results: A total of ten patients were identified to have paraconduit hernias. During this time interval, there were a total of 130 esophageal resections performed. All patients had esophagectomy for malignant disease. Seven of the 10 patients have undergone surgery. Two patients are asymptomatic and are being followed at their request, and one patient is pending elective correction. Of the seven patients who underwent surgery, the median age was 58, with 5 males and two females. Six of the seven patients underwent minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy and one had an open McKeown procedure. The median time from esophagectomy to hernia repair was 12 months, with range from 1 month to 120 months. The most common presenting complaint was abdominal pain and nausea. One patient was noted to have a paraconduit hernia on postoperative day 5 and taken to surgery for repair during the hospitalization. There was one death in a patient who presented with necrosis of the small bowel. The remaining 6 patients all had laparoscopic approach. One patient required a hand port to reduce incarcerated colon and one patient was noted to have a cecal perforation during port closure requiring repair. All patients had herniated colon, with small intestine or pancreas herniation noted in three. Repair was performed by reducing the viscera, a left phrenic relaxing incision, closure of the hiatus around the conduit and then closure of the diaphragmatic defect with mesh. At median follow up of 6 months, there are no recurrences. Conclusion: Hiatal paraconduit hernias are becoming a frequent finding among survivors of esophageal cancer surgery. Our study demonstrates that there is a propensity for patients who undergo minimally invasive esophagectomy to develop these hernias. The vast majority of patients can undergo laparoscopic repair. Our recommendation is to perform a diaphragmatic relaxing incision and liberal use of mesh. Early results appear to be favorable regarding recurrence. Aim: There have been several reports illustrating the safety and efficacy of various surgical techniques in performing laparoscopic esophagojejunostomy (EJ). This study aims to compare two established methods of EJ anastomosis -circular stapling with purse-string suture (\"Lap-Jack\") and linear stapling technique -in laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Methods: 314 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer underwent intracorporeal EJ anastomosis in laparoscopic total gastrectomy from January, 2013 to October, 2016. 254 cases used the circular stapler with purse-string \"lap-jack\" method, and 60 patients used the linear stapling method for EJ anastomosis. 59 were matched using propensity scores, and retrospective data for patient characteristics, surgical outcome, and post-operative complications was reviewed.",

However, it is a technically demanding procedure, and the feasibility remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to clarify the feasibility of LG for AGC. Patients and Methods: The present study included 266 patients who underwent LG for AGC between 2010 and 2017. The indication of LG has gradually expanded in our institute, and is currently any stage gastric cancer except for gastric cancer obviously invading adjacent organs or gastric stump carcinoma. We retrospectively reviewed short-and long-term surgical outcomes of the patients. Results: Male/female ratio was 2:1, and median age (range) was 68 (23-90) years. Distal gastrectomy was most frequently performed (62 %), followed by total gastrectomy (33%). Median operation time and intraoperative blood loss was 251 (156-529) minutes and 15 (0-505) g, respectively. Clavien-Dindo grade III or more complication rate was 8.6%. With a median followup period of 18 months, the 3-year recurrence free survival rates of pStage II and III patients were 98% and 91%, respectively. Conclusion: The outcomes of LG for AGC are satisfactory, provided that an experienced team performs the surgery. Introduction: The present study aims to evaluate the predictive value of indocyanine green (ICG) for the detection and prevention of anastomotic leak following esophagectomy. Anastomotic leak is a highly morbid and potentially fatal complication of esophagectomy. Ensuring adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit can minimize the risk of postoperative leak. Intraoperative evaluation with fluorescence angiography using ICG offers a dynamic assessment of gastric conduit perfusion, and can guide anastomotic site selection. Methods: A search of electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library using the search terms \"indocyanine/fluorescence\" AND esophagectomy was completed to include all English articles published between 1946 and August 2017. Articles were selected by two independent reviewers based on the following major inclusion criteria: (1) Esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction; (2) use of fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green to assess perfusion; (3) age \u226518 years; (4) sufficient outcome data for the calculation of leak rates and (5) sample size \u22655.

Most marginal ulcers resolve with medical management and lifestyle changes, but in the rare case of a non-healing marginal ulcer there are few treatment options. Revision of the gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis carries significant morbidity and mortality with complication rates ranging from 10 to 50%. Thoracoscopic truncal vagotomy (TTV) may be a safer alternative with decreased operative times. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of TTV in comparison to GJ revision for treatment of recalcitrant marginal ulcers. Methods and Procedures: A retrospective chart review of patients who required surgical intervention for non-healing marginal ulcers was performed from 1st September 2012 to 1st September 2017. All underwent medical therapy along with lifestyle changes prior to intervention and had preoperative EGD that demonstrated a recalcitrant marginal ulcer.

However, further prospective observational studies with a larger patient population would be beneficial to evaluate complication rates and ulcer recurrence rates between groups. We present a case of a 59-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer who initially presented to an outside hospital complaining of reflux, abdominal pain, early satiety, and 35-pound unintentional weight loss. Endoscopy demonstrated a 2 cm pre-pyloric mass; with initial biopsies of the mass demonstrating only gastric mucosa. Endoscopic ultrasound and FNA of the lesion also failed to elucidate its pathology. Due to the pyloric location of the mass and inability to rule out invasive malignancy, we recommended a robotic-assisted transgastric submucosal resection with possible distal gastrectomy. Intraoperatively we found a 270-degree circumferential pre-pyloric exophytic sessile tumor. Frozen sections suggested a benign papillary tumor therefore we proceeded with submucosal resection. The resulting mucosal defect and gastrotomy were closed primarily with absorbable suture. Final pathology showed the tumor to be a tubulovillous adenoma with high grade dysplasia arising against a background of intestinal metaplasia. The resection margins were negative for dysplasia. The postoperative course was complicated by a minor leak which did not require operative intervention and subsequent gastric outlet narrowing which required endoscopic dilation and feeding tube placement. However, the patient has recovered well and has advanced to diet as tolerated. Gastric adenoma has a prevalence of 0.5-3.75% in the western hemisphere. The risk of carcinomatous transformation in gastric adenomas is related to size, degree of dysplasia, and villosity. Gastric adenomas are considered precancerous lesions. Pre-operative pathologic diagnosis of dysplasia is often elusive as biopsies will often miss or under-grade the lesion. Guidelines advocate for complete resection with either endoscopic submucosal dissection or surgical resection depending on surgeon preference and local expertise. Endoscopic resection has been shown to be safe and efficacious in the removal of adenomas with good long-term outcomes. In this case the pathology of the lesion was unclear after multiple unsuccessful biopsies and required a surgical diagnosis to rule out invasive malignancy. Management of gastric adenomas, while rare, may require a multidisciplinary approach between surgical endoscopy, minimally invasive surgery, and surgical oncology to achieve local control in an oncologically sound manner. We show that transgastric submucosal resection can be achieved in a minimally invasive fashion using robotic assistance. Objective: Parahiatal Hernia is a rare type of diaphragmatic hernia with incidence of 0.2-0.35%. Para-hiatal hernias arises lateral to the left crural musculature adjacent to but separate from the oesophageal diaphragmatic hiatus. In view of its rare occurance and little clinical suspicion, it is almost never diagnosed clinically. The current case report is intended to depict the clinical profile of an intraoperatively diagnosed para-hiatal hernia and feasibility of laparoscopic repair of parahiatal hernias. Method: Laparoscopic fundoplication is frequently performed at Grant Medical College and Sir J. J. Group of Hospitals, India. During one such case intraoperatively Para-hiatal hernia was diagnosed.",

The primary treatment of para-hiatal hernia is mesh-plasty. This is coupled with fundoplication in cases of large hernia and those symptomatic for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Laparoscopic repair of these uncommon hernias is safe, effective and provides all of the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. Conclusion: Due to its rare occurrence, knowledge about this condition among laparoscopic surgeons is important to avoid diagnostic dilemma. Knowledge about its management aids intraoperatvely to avoid performing incomplete procedure. ",

According to current Japanese guidelines, additional gastrectomy with lymph node dissection (LND) is recommended for patients proven to have potential risks of lymph node metastasis (LNM) on histopathological findings. On the other hand, the frequency of LNM in these patients is exteremely low. The aim of this study was to elucidate the accurate risk of LNM based on the number of risk factors (RF) for possible LNM, and to compare the stratified risk of LNM with predicted risk from additional radical resection. Methods and Procedures: We enrolled 589 EGC patients who did not meet absolute or extended indications of endoscopic resection, and investigated the risk stratification of LNM according to the total number of LNM RFs described below; (1) SM2, (2) lymphatic vessels invasion, (3) Undifferentiated adenocarinoma and [20 mm in diameter, and (4) [30 mm in diameter and ulcer formation. We compared the stratification risk to the surgical risk that was calculated based on the Japanese National Clinical Database (NCD) risk calculator in 52 patients with additional gastrectomy after ESD.",

Aims: Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy has been applied for early gastric cancer in upper third. We previously reported outcomes of laparoscopic total gastrectomy in managing this condition. In this study, we applied this modified technique for upper third early gastric cancer with double tract reconstruction. It is expected that our technique could be useful for treating these cases. Methods: From April of 2004 to June of 2017, 69 consecutive patients with upper third early gastric cancer were assigned to undergo surgical treatment with proximal gastrectory at our hospital. We had 195 cases of total gastrectory for upper third early gastric cancer in the same study period. Background: Laparoscopic total gastrectomy for remnant gastric cancer is much more difficult than common Laparoscopic total gastrectomy due to severe adhesions to adjacent organs, displacement of anatomical structure. Purpose: The aim was to analyze 10 cases of Laparoscopic total gastrectomy for remnant gastric cancer at the Department of Surgery of Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital between November 1999 and April 2017.

We performed laparoscopic distal gastrectomy in 5 cases, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy in 2 pcases, and open distal gastrectomy in 3 cases. All cases were performed laparoscopic total gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction. 1 case of them had been converted to open surgery due to severe adhesions. The mean operative time was 271 min and the mean blood loss was 189 ml. There were no intraoperative complications, and there were 2 postoperative complications as a pancreatic fistula and a bowel obstruction. However, there were no intra-operative complications more than Grade 3 according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 22.4 days. All cases were without recurrence. Thus, there were no significant differences in operative time, bleeding volumes, intra and postoperative complications and hospital stay compared with Laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Conclusions: Laparoscopic total remnant gastrectomy can be performed with similar short-term outcomes to Laparoscopic total gastrectomy, and may be feasible and safe procedure, and can become an option of therapeutic strategy. Although this study was not powered to show lower recurrence rates with synthetic absorbable as compared to biologic, the 8.51% recurrence rate is consistent with other series utilizing this mesh. It is interesting to note the difference in time to recurrence. These results suggest that while synthetic absorbable mesh may result in lower recurrence rates, recurrence seems to occur earlier.",

We wished to examine the incidence in our institution, and identify potential risk factors for development of gastroparesis following LPHR. Methods and Procedures: A single institution retrospective chart review was preformed using CPT codes corresponding to paraesophageal hernia repair and fundoplication to identify patients undergoing laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair over a five year period (1/1/2012-12/31/ 2016) by three surgeons. Emergency procedures and reoperations were excluded. In total, 93 patients undergoing non-emergent first time LPHRs were identified. Size of the hiatal defect was identified when able, via either measurement between the diaphragmatic crura on CT or by medical record documentation. Data obtained included sex, age, hernia type, mesh usage, and existence of specific comorbidities associated with gastroparesis. Presence of gastroparesis was identified either by documentation of diagnosis via clinical judgment, or by results of gastric emptying nuclear medicine studies, with timing being no longer than 6 months from date of surgery. Independent Students t-test and Fisher exact test were used to determine statistical differences between the groups. Results: 93 patients undergoing non-emergent first time LPHRs were identified. Of these, we were able to obtain the size of the hiatal defect in 72 patients. 10 patients overall were diagnosed with gastroparesis, with an overall incidence of 11.0%. When comparing all patients who developed gastroparesis to those who did not, only females comprised the group which did develop gastroparesis (0 males/10 females with GP, 28 males/55 females without GP, p=0.029). Age was also found to be greater in the group which developed gastroparesis. For patients in which the size of the hernia defect was identified, the average age was 9 years older in the group diagnosed with gastroparesis ( Step 1 Under laparoscopic view, left part of the lesser omentum was cut with preserving the hepatic branch of vagus nerve. The right crus of the diaphragma has been dissected free from the soft tissue around the stomach and abdominal esophagus. In this step the fascia of the right crus should be preserved and the soft tissue should not been damaged to avoid bleeding. After cutting the peritoneum just inside the right crus, the soft tissue was dissected bluntly to left side. Then the inside margin of the left crus of the diaphragma was recognized from the right side.

Among these patients, 31 (1.4%) were determined as internal hernia by Computed Tomography and 29 patients (1.3%) underwent surgical treatment of internal herniation. Two patients were conservatively managed. All patients suffered from abdominal pain and 13/31(42%) patients showed nausea and vomiting. The median interval between the initial gastrectomy and surgery for internal hernia was 450 days. Mesenteric hernia was observed in 18 cases and Petersen's hernia in 12 cases. Since we started closing the mesenteric and Petersen's defects from May of 2015, there were only 5 cases (16%) observed afterwards but there were 24 cases (84%) before closure of the defects. Conclusion: Internal hernia after gastrectomy is likely underreported. Although we analyzed 31 patients with internal hernia, there might be more patients with mild symptoms who were managed conservatively by their own. A high degree of suspiciousness for internal hernia should be maintained in patients presenting symptoms like nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain after gastrectomy with potential space for internal hernia. With our experience, closure of the mesenteric and Petersen's defect is helpful in reducing internal hernia. However, due to low incidence, a multicenter retrospective study is necessary. Introduction: The increased incidence of anemia in patients with a hiatal hernia (HH) has been clearly demonstrated, as has resolution of anemia after HH repair in these patients. Despite this, the implications of preoperative anemia on postoperative outcomes have not been well described. In this study, we aimed to identify the incidence of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing HH repair at our institution and sought to determine whether preoperative anemia had an impact on postoperative outcomes. Methods and Procedures: Using our IRB-approved institutional HH database, we retrospectively identified patients undergoing HH repair between January 2011 and April 2017 at our institution. We identified all patients with anemia, defined as serum hemoglobin levels less than 13 mg/dL in men and 12 mg/dL in women, measured within two weeks prior to surgery, and compared this cohort to those that had normal hemoglobin values preoperatively. Specific perioperative outcomes analyzed included: estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, need for blood transfusion, failure to extubate postoperatively, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmission. Results: We identified 266 patients undergoing HH repair, of which 233 had preoperative bloodwork available for review. The average age was 64 years and the majority of patients were female (79%, n=208). Most were treated electively (75%, n=196) and with a minimally invasive approach (97%, n=255). 70 patients (26.6%) had preoperative anemia. Compared to patients without anemia, patients with anemia had increased rates of failed extubation postoperatively (7.1% vs. 1.5%, p=0.033), increased ICU admissions (12.9% vs. 5.1%, p=0.034), increased need for perioperative blood transfusions (11.4% vs 0%, p=0.0003), and increased rates of postoperative complications (41.4% vs. 18.1%, p\\0.0001). Although mean LOS (4.3 days vs. 3.2 days, p 0.077), mean operating time (262 mins vs. 252 mins, p=0.10), and EBL (52 ml vs 38 ml, p=0.38) were greater in the anemic group, they did not reach statistical significance, and there was no significant difference in 30-day readmission rate (8.6% vs 8.8%, p=0.95).",

Patient demographics and perioperative characteristics were recorded. Hiatal hernia was classified per published SAGES guidelines as type III or IV using operative reports and preoperative imaging. Patients with type I or II or recurrent hiatal hernia and patients receiving concomitant procedures were excluded. The GERD-Health Related Quality of Life Survey was administered by telephone no earlier than 18 months postoperatively. Patients responded to items concerning symptom severity using a 5-point scale (0=no symptoms to 5=symptoms are incapacitating to do daily activities). Symptoms surveyed included heartburn (6 items), difficulty swallowing (1 item) and regurgitation (6 items Introduction: As the thoracic esophageal carcinoma has a high metastatic rate of upper mediastinal lymph nodes, especially along the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), it is crucial to perform complete lymph node dissection along the RLN without complications. Although Intraoperative neural monitoring (IONM) during thyroid and parathyroid surgery has gained widespread acceptance as the useful tool of visual nerve identification, the utilization of IONM during esophageal surgery has not become common. Here, we describe our procedures focusing on a lymphadenectomy along the RLN utilizing the IONM. Methods and Procedures: We first dissect ventral and dorsal side of the esophagus preserving the membranous structure (Meso-esophagus), which contains tracheoesophageal artery, RLN and lymph nodes. We next identify the location of the RLN which runs in the Meso-esophagus using IONM before visual contact. After that, we perform lymphadenectomy around the RLN preserving the nerve. This technique was evaluated in 30 consecutive cases (neural monitoring group; Nm) of esophagectomy in prone positioning, and compared with our historical 56 cases (conventional method group; Cm Background: Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair, particularly large type 1 and type 3 hernias, is associated with high recurrence rates. Various use of overlay mesh reinforcement have been described in an attempt to improve outcomes. Unfortunately, overlay use of biologic mesh continues to result in high recurrence rates, and more effective repairs employing permanent mesh raise serious erosion concerns and are therefore rarely used. We theorize that employing an interlay technique with permanent mesh (positioned between both crura) will help enhance crural closure and improve rates of hiatal hernia recurrences with minimal risk of erosion. Methods: We reviewed all patients who underwent a laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair from April 2015 to August 2017 by a single surgeon from a prospectively maintained database at a tertiary care referral center (n=72). Patients who underwent surgery for achalasia with concurrent hiatal repair were excluded. During this time frame, a new interlay technique of polypropylene mesh was employed upon suture closure of the crura. Outcomes of repair were retrospectively reviewed. Recurrence of hernia was identified by positive work up of patient's symptoms (new onset dysphagia, GERD, pain).",

The reasons of conversion to open surgery were advanced stage (n=59), intraoperative bleeding (n=19), adhesion due to previous abdominal operation (n=10), small abdominal cavity (n=4), associated disease (n=4), and intraoperative pleural injury (n=2). The mean hospital stay was 7.0 days for distal gastrectomy, 9.6 days for total gastrectomy, 8.3 days for proximal gastrectomy, and 6.5 days for pylorus preserving gastrectomy. The mean number of collected lymph nodes was 58.7 for distal gastrectomy, 70.1 for total gastrectomy, 43.0 for proximal gastrectomy, and 46.5 for pylorus preserving gastrectomy. The rates of postoperative complications of grade II or more were 9.4 %. There was one case of postoperative mortality due to delayed bleeding after discharge. Old age was the only independent predictor of surgical morbidities. Background: Intrathoracic gastric volvulus is a life-threatening condition of paraesophageal hernia. The therapeutic is a challenge because in acute volvulus it may lead to gastric strangulation and necrosis. Most patients are elderly and with a significant associated medical illness which has higher morbidity and mortality of major surgery. We present a laparoscopic surgery is safe in paraesophageal hernia with acute intrathoracic gastric volvulus in a high-risk patient.",

ERAS programs have been demonstrated to improve outcomes and decrease length of stay in multiple surgical disciplines however relatively little has been published regarding the impact of ERAS programs in bariatric surgery. Methods: An ERAS program for all patients undergoing bariatric surgery was implemented in February 2017 at a single institution. We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between February 2017 and August 2017. As a pre-ERAS historical control, we also reviewed all patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between January 2016 and December 2016. Baseline patient characteristics, additional concomitant operative procedures as well as 30-day readmission and complication rates were reviewed. Logistic regression analysis was used in univariate and multivariate models to identify factors that predicted early post-operative discharge. Data analysis was completed using Stata 12 SE software (StataCorp LP; College Station, TX). Results: Eighty-five patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy after implementation of the ERAS program while 169 patients were included in the pre-ERAS control group. There were no statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the two groups and there were no differences in the rate of concomitant procedures performed. There was a statistically significant decrease in post-operative length of stay following implementation of the ERAS program from 2. It has been reported that Laparoscopic redo surgery is effective for recurrent GERD and/or hiatal hernia after surgery. However, there has been very few reports from Japan. We report an initial experience of laparoscopic surgery for Japanese patients with recurrent GERD and/or hiatal hernia. Among 177 patients who had undergone laparoscopic fundoplication in our hospital from 1997 to 2016, 15 patients with recurrent GERD/hiatal hernia underwent redo surgery. Preoperative work-up included upper GI series, endoscopy, CT, 24 h pH-impedance and manometry. The patients consisted of 8 women and 7 men with a mean age of 65.8 years. The interval from the initial surgery was 26.7 months (4 days-60 months). The types of initial fundoplication were Nissen: 10, Toupet: 4, Anterior: 1. The types of recurrence were sliding hernia: 11 and paraesophageal hernia: 4. One patient with recurrent sliding hernia had poor gastric motility. Laparoscopic redo surgery was performed on 14 patients. Redo surgery included crural repair with mesh reinforcement: 3, refundoplication: 10 (Nissen-Nissen: 3, Nissen-Toupet: 5, Toupet-Toupet: 1, Toupet-lateral: 1) and reduction of the incarcerated paraesophageal hernia: 1. Additional procedure included mesh reinforcement: 4 and pyloroplasty: 1. Open partial gastrectomy was performed for one patient with incarcerated and strangulated hernia. Operation time was 226 min. 3 patients was converted to open surgery. Oral intake was started on the 1st POD and postoperative stay was 6.5 days. Two patients recurred after redo surgery, one of whom underwent re-redo surgery. During the surgery, IVC was injured but rescued by open surgery. Eleven patients had good outcome and 4 patients required PPI after redo surgery. Our morphological fundoplication score significantly improved after redo surgery. Symptom score and acid exposure time were also significantly improved after redo surgery. Laparoscopic redo surgery for recurrent GERD and/or hiatal hernia after surgery is safe and effective, although attention should be paid during surgery to avoid injury of the adjacent organs.",

            "text": "Surg Endosc (2018) Introduction: Cameron ulcers (CU) are linear erosions or ulcerations in the gastric mucosa at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus in patients with a hiatal hernia (HH) and are frequently associated with anemia. Perioperative outcomes of patients with CU undergoing HH repair are not well described. We sought to identify the incidence of CU in patients undergoing HH repair at our institution and determine whether the presence of CU impacted postoperative outcomes. Methods and Procedures: Using our IRB-approved institutional HH database, we retrospectively identified patients undergoing repair between January 2011 and April 2017. We identified all patients with CU found on preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). We compared patients with and without CU to determine if they differed in terms of preoperative anemia (defined as hemoglobin levels less than 13 mg/dL in men and 12 mg/dL in women). Lastly, we compared outcomes between the CU group and the non-CU group, focusing on need for perioperative blood transfusion, failure to extubate postoperatively, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmission. Conclusions: The presence of CU on preoperative EGD is associated with increased rate of preoperative anemia, increased LOS, and increased ICU admission after HH repair. Although the cause of anemia in patients with HH is commonly attributed to CU, only 38% of CU patients were anemic, indicating that differences in outcomes may not only be attributed to a higher incidence of anemia in CU patients. The implications of CU in patients undergoing HH repair need to be further elucidated.",

Introduction: Stent treatment in the gastrointestinal tract is emerging as a standard therapy for overcoming strictures and sealing perforations. We have started to treat patients with perforated duodenal ulcers using a partially covered stent and external drainage achieving good clinical results. Stent migration is a serious complication that may require surgery. Pyloric physiology during stent-treatment has not been studied and mechanisms for migration are unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate the pyloric response to distention mimicking stent-treatment, using the EndoFLIP, investigating changes in motility patterns due to distention at baseline, after a pro-kinetic drug and after food ingestion. Methods: A non-survival study in five pigs was carried out, followed by a pilot study in one human volunteer. A gastroscopy was performed in anaesthetized pigs and the EndoFLIP was placed through the scope straddling the pylorus. Baseline distensibility readings were performed at stepwise balloon distention to 20 ml, 30 ml, 40 ml and 50 ml, measuring pyloric cross sectional area and pyloric pressure. Measurements were repeated after administration of a pro-kinetic drug (Neostigmin) and after instillation of a liquid meal. In the human study readings were performed in conscious sedation at baseline and after stimulation with metoclopramide. Results: During baseline readings the pylorus was shown to open more with increasing distention, together with higher amplitude motility waves. Reaching maximum distention-volume (50 ml), pyloric pressure increased significantly (p=0.016) and motility waves disappeared. After prokinetic stimulation pyloric pressure decreased and motility waves increased in frequency and amplitude at 20, 30 and 40 ml distentions. After food stimulation pyloric pressure stayed low and motility waves showed increase in amplitude at distentions of 20, 30 and 40 ml. During both tests the pylorus showed higher pressure and lack of motility waves at maximum probe distention of 50 ml. Similar results were found in the human study.",

            "text": "The pylorus seems to acts as a sphincter at low distention but when further dilated starts acting as a peristaltic pump. When fully distended, pyloric motility waves almost disappeared and the pressure remained high, leaving the pylorus open and inactive. Stent placement in the pylorus results in pyloric distention, possibly changing motility. This study indicates that a duodenal stent placed over the pylorus should have a high radial force in the pyloric part in order to dilate the pylorus and diminish the contraction waves, this might reduce stent migration. Introduction: Cutting-edge technology in the field of minimal invasive surgery allows the application of singleincision laparoscopic surgery on gastric cancer. However, single-incision distal gastrectomy (SIDG) is still technically difficult due to limited range of motion and unstable field of view-even in the hands of an experienced scopist. Solo surgery using a passive scope holder may be the key in allowing SIDG to be safer and efficient. We report our initial experience of 100 consecutive cases of solo SIDG. Methods: Prospectively collected database of 100 patients clinically diagnosed as early gastric cancer who underwent solo SIDG from October 2013 until July 2016 were analyzed. All the operations were held by a single surgeon and a scrub nurse. A passive laparoscopic scope holder was controlled by the surgeon to fix the field of view. Results: The mean operation time (SD) was 122.8 (\u00b134.9) min, and the average estimated blood loss was 30.5\u00b1 57.0 ml. Average body mass index was 23.4\u00b12.9 kg/m 2 . The median hospital stay (range) was 5 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) days, and the mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was 56.0\u00b122.8. There was no conversion to multiport or open surgery. Early postoperative complication occurred on 7% with three delayed gastric emptying, two postoperative pneumonia, one pancreatitis, and one wound complication. Conclusion: Solo SIDG using a passive scope holder allows SIDG to become more feasible by providing a stable field of view. There were no peri-operative deaths in either group. In the elective group, age was not an independent risk factor for complications (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98-1.12).",

We present a single-center experience with a \"Myotomy first\" approach for all patients, regardless of diverticular size. The hypothesis is that cardiomyotomy alone will provide satisfactory symptom abatement in some patients. And MIS Cardiomyotomy causes minimal scarring, so a staged MIS diverticulectomy is feasible at a later date if diverticular retention/stasis continues. In order to discuss this treatment algorithm we present our experience with cardiomyotomy alone for patients with epiphrenic diverticula. Methods: The electronic medical record was queried for patients with esophageal diverticula who were managed with cardiomyotomy and Dor fundoplication alone. Pre and post-operative reflux/dysphagia questionnaires were gathered; imaging studies, operative data, complications and follow up were reviewed. Results: From March of 2016 until the present, 7 patients with esophageal diverticula were treated using the \"myotomy first\" approach. Intraoperative Esophagoscopy was done to internally visualize the elimination of the inciting spastic esophageal muscle. Preoperatively, all patients complained of regurgitation, followed by Dysphagia in 6 (85%) and Weight loss 3 (42%). Postoperatively, dysphagia and weight loss resolved in all subjects. Regurgitation symptoms resolved in 6 (85%) patients. The average size of the diverticula was 22.7 cm 2 , the range was 2-62 cm 2 . Post operative esophagream's showed persistent diverticual, however most had decreased in size. There were no perioperative complications, average length of stay was 2.1 days and there were no ICU admissions or returns to the OR. The average length of follow up for these patients was 116 days where all patients reported being satisfied with their results and none of them have yet desired to pursue diverticulectomy. Discussion: A \"Myotomy first\" approach resulted in excellent short term symptomatic control. None of the 7 have retained or re-experienced symptoms of diverticular retention worthy of surgical intervention. In the age of laparoscopic surgery, an esophageal epiphrenic diverteculectomy should be staged. This step wise approach seeks to assure surgical necessity for a morbid endeavor.",

Gastro-oesophageal anastomotic leak is a potentially devastating complication of this procedure affecting perioperative morbidity and mortality. Although the leak rates have improved over the years, it still remains widely variable. Intraoperative reinforcement of gastro-oesophageal anastomosis with an 'omental wrap' has been proposed as a measure to reduce anastomotic leak rates. There is some data to suggest that this additional technique reduces anastomotic leak. We reviewed our single institution data to assess if the omental wrap indeed had a 'cocoon' effect in maturing the anastomosis and reducing leak rates.",

This study assessed the impact of the first assistant on shortterm outcomes of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) and laparoscope-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG). Methods: Patients who underwent LDG or LADG for gastric cancer at our hospital, between November 2013 and August 2017, were included. LDG and LADG cases of Billroth I reconstruction, performed by a single surgeon accredited in endoscopic procedures, were analyzed. The cases were categorized into the following 4 groups according to the first assistant's postgraduate years (PGY) of experience: group A, 3-5 years; group B, 6-10 years; group C, 11-15 years; and group D, [16 years. Short-term outcomes were compared between the groups. Results: We examined 48 cases. Operative time was significantly longer in group A than in group B (P=0.029). No significant differences in operative time were found between groups B, C, and D. The cases were recategorized into 2 groups as follows: group A, the young assistant group (group Y, n=8), and groups B, C, and D, the senior assistant group (group S, n=40). Significant differences in operative time and method of anastomosis (circular stapler or delta anastomosis) were observed between the 2 groups (P=0.0054 and P=0.0028, respectively), but no significant differences in complication rates were found (P=1.0000). The unadjusted analysis revealed that the group, method of anastomosis, and body mass index (BMI) were significant factors associated with longer operative time. Multivariate linear regression analysis with stepwise model selection using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) revealed that BMI and group were significant factors associated with longer operative time (P=0.0075 and P=0.0024, respectively). Multivariate analysis using these 2 variables and the method of anastomosis confirmed the significance of BMI and group for longer operative time, but no significance was found in the method of anastomosis (P=0.0088, P=0.021, and P=0.51, respectively). Conclusions: Our study showed that operative time tended to be longer when the first assistant had experience of less than 6 PGY, but the morbidity did not increase. As with the operator, the first assistant needs adequate training to ensure a smooth operation.",

Magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) has been used as an alternative treatment for GERD with good success, but there is no data to support its use in LPR. Methods: Forty-five patients with MSA implants for symptomatic relief with both GERD and LPR symptoms were examined. All patients experienced at least one typical GERD symptom as well as at least one extra-esophageal symptom. This was assessed using the GERD-HRQL which is 15 questions graded 1-5 on each question, and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) which is 9 questions graded 1-5 on each question. Patients filled out questionnaires preoperatively, one month postoperatively (early follow up), and at 6 months to 1 year postoperatively (late follow up). The responses on the GERD-HRQL were clustered into questions inquiring about heartburn (6), dysphagia (2), and regurgitation (6) Like all surgical fields there is a push towards standardization of the post operative course while maintaining safe practices. Other surgical fields have streamlined recovery processes in an effort to standardize care and minimize costs. Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair is a complex procedure, but with experience and a team approach, this operation can become a streamline process. Methods: A retrospective review was done for over 250 laparoscopic hiatal hernia repairs at a single institution. Aspects of post operative care such hospital floor, nursing ratio utilized, pain medication, diet advancement, use of foley catheters and length of hospital stay were tracked. Statistical analysis was done to compare utilization of resources as years went on along with complications and readmissions.",

Anytime a procedure and its post operative course can become less of a \"major undertaking\" and more routine, the more streamline it becomes. This comes from making a standard protocol that deescalates treatment based on what is actually needed. Nearly every aspect of post operative care was simplified; length of stay and cost to the hospital was decreased while no additional complications or readmissions were accrued. The foundation of a formalized advanced recovery pathway will be implemented from these factors which were studied. Background: The obesity epidemic continues to worsen. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective way to achieve weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has become the most common bariatric operation due to excellent efficacy and low morbidity and mortality. The most common complication of sleeve gastrectomy is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can adversely impact the quality of life and lead to additional esophageal complications. Recently, esophageal magnetic sphincter augmentation (LINX\u00ae) has become an acceptable alternative to fundoplication for certain patients with GERD. The use of LINX\u00ae in patients who previously underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was described in a case series in 2015. The known complications of these devices include dysphagia, need for endoscopic dilation, and device erosion. The complication profile of LINX\u00ae in the setting of sleeve gastrectomy has not been reported heretofore. Methods: We present a case of a patient with prior sleeve gastrectomy who received a LINX\u00ae device one year after her bariatric operation due to severe GERD refractory to medical management. Initial evaluation demonstrated a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter and hiatal hernia, but no evidence of stricture or twisting. Soon after LINX\u00ae implantation, the patient developed progressive dysphagia and worsened reflux. Repeat evaluation showed esophagitis, a moderate stricture with angulation at the incisura, and a large amount of retained food. Discussion: The patient was recommended conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, but was deemed to be a poor candidate due to heavy smoking. Thus, laparoscopic removal of the LINX\u00ae device was performed with hiatal hernia repair and gastric stricturoplasty. Post-operative fluoroscopic evaluation revealed improvement in the stricture, but persistent gastroesophageal reflux. The patient experienced a significant improvement in her symptoms of dysphagia, nausea, and vomiting. However, once smoking cessation is achieved, she may still need a conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in order to address persistent GERD.",

New approaches to this problem, including placement of LINX\u00ae, are promising but have not been evaluated for long-term safety and efficacy in the setting of prior bariatric surgery. Careful diagnostic evaluation prior to placement of magnetic sphincter augmentation device should be routinely undertaken. Postoperatively, close long-term follow up is imperative, particularly in patients with prior sleeve gastrectomy. Presence of LINX\u00ae in a patient with prior bariatric surgery may lead to worsening symptoms if complications of initial operation are present.",

Timed barium esophagogram (TBE) is a convenient method to assess esophageal clearance, which we usually performed before and after surgery. Meanwhile, laparoscopic Heller-Dor operation (LHD) has been considered worldwide as a gold standard for the surgical management of esophageal achalasia. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of preoperative clearance rate at the lower part of the esophagus on surgical outcomes in patients with esophageal achalasia. Patients and Method: Between August 1994 and April 2017, patients who underwent LHD at our institution were extracted from the database. Out of 557 patients, 398 patients met our inclusion criteria; such as the patients who underwent LHD as an initial operation with complete evaluation with preoperative esophageal clearance by TBE. These patients were divided into three groups by the degree of esophageal clearance (Group A: clearance rate \\10%, Group B: 10%? clearance rate \\50%, and Group C: 50%? clearance rate). Patients' background, pre-and post-operative symptom scores, and surgical results were compared. Before and after surgery, the standardized questionnaire was used to assess the degree of frequency and severity of symptoms (dysphagia, vomiting, chest pain and heartburn). Moreover, satisfaction with operation was evaluated using the standardized questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed by using Krasukal-Wallis test or chi-square test, and p-value less than 0.05 was defined as statistically different.",

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to clarify the long-term and short-term outcomes of 330 consecutive patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the prone position using a preceding anterior approach for the resection of esophageal cancer at a single institution. This method was established to make an esophagectomy easier to perform and to achieve better outcomes in terms of safety and curativity. Methods and Procedures: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 673 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who had undergone a thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TE, 330 patients) or an esophagectomy through thoracotomy (OE, 343 patients) between January 2003 and August 2017. To compare the long-term outcomes of TE and OE, we used a propensity score matching analysis and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. To analyze the short-term outcomes of TE, patients were chronologically divided into three groups: a first period group (110 patients), a second period group (110 patients), and a third period group (110 patients). As for thoracoscopic procedure, the esophagus was mobilized from the anterior structure during the first step and from the posterior structure during the second step. The lymph nodes around the esophagus were also dissected anteriorly and posteriorly. The intraoperative factors, the number of dissected lymph nodes, and the incidence of adverse events were compared among the three period groups using a one-way ANOVA or Chi-square test. Results: One hundred and twenty-three patients from each group, for a total of 246 patients, were completely selected and paired. ",

Esophago-gastric anastomosis is performed as following, i) Trapezoidal Tunnel Method Sero-muscular layer of anterior wall in the near top of gastric conduit is peeled from submucosal layer after parallel horizontal incision of sero-muscular layer, and then trapezoidal tunnel of sero-muscular layer is created. The edge of the proximal esophagus is drawn into the tunnel and esophago-gastric submucosa anastomosis is performed. To wrap anastomosis distal side of parallel line is closed. ii) modified circular stapling At first the circular stapler is introduced into the gastric conduit and joined to an anvil, and close a little. And then a joined anvil is placed into the proximal esophagus and secured by means of a pursestring suture. The gastric conduit opening is closed by a linear stapler. Purpose: Mesh utilization and its impact on postoperative hernia recurrence following paraesophageal hernia repair remains a polarizing topic. This analysis evaluates the recent trends in laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repairs and analyzes the impact of operative time on postoperative morbidity. Methods: The 2013-2015 ACS-NSQIP database was queried for primary CPT code for laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with and without mesh (43282/43281). Only elective cases performed by a general surgeon were included. Operative time was grouped into quartiles (80-110, 111-142, 143-185, 186-360 min) and statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA univariate with post-hoc testing and multivariate regression modeling controlling for age, diabetes, renal disease and weight loss. This analysis was powered to detect a greater than 2% difference in outcomes based on mesh utilization. The outcomes of interest were composite morbidity scores and readmission rates within 30 days of surgery. Results: The database identified a cohort of 6,234 laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repairs performed between 2013 and 2015.

However, the minimally invasive approach in advanced disease is still controversial. The outcomes of laparoscopic gastrectomy in the elderly have also not been extensively studied. We aim to evaluate our institution's short term outcomes of laparoscopic versus open gastrectomy for gastric cancer-with particular focus on advanced disease and elderly patients. Methodology: We prospectively collected the data of all patients who underwent gastrectomies for stomach cancer from 2008 to 2015. All patients underwent a partial or total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. The decision for open or laparoscopic approach was decided between surgeon and patient. We excluded patients who underwent palliative resection. All patients were followed up for at least one year post-operatively. Introduction: It was an eye-opener when the lancet brought the attention about global surgery. It is estimated that the deaths due to lack of access to surgery is far greater than deaths due to malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS put together. There is greater need to stress the importance in developing countries. There is a responsibility at the medical schools to enlighten students about this necessity and arouse interest in concept of global surgery. The students or surgical residents in the future are a great resource to solve this major problem. The first step would be to educate surgical residents. We need to assess the existing awareness about global surgery problem among surgical residents. We can plan a program to train the next generation surgeons. Methods and Procedure: All the surgical residents in our institution (Victoria hospital, Bangalore, India) were enrolled for this study. A total of 212 residents were enrolled. A multiple-choice questionnaire regarding global surgery was designed. The received questionnaire was analyzed to assess the depth of knowledge about global surgery. There were 20 multiple choice questions (MCQ) and an option was provided at the end for feedback and suggestion to improve the global surgery in our country. Each question carried one mark. Score more than 10 was considered the cutoff for pass and those students were termed 'informed'. Results: 91(42.9%) students cleared the cut off score of 10 and were termed 'informed'. Among this group 21 (9%) residents scored 20 marks. 121 (57.07%) students did not cross the cut off and were termed 'non-informed'. Among these 57 (26.8%) students scored 0 marks and did not know anything on the topic. 43 students provided relevant suggestions and opinions to improve global surgery issue.",

Introduction: Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MISTs) could have tremendous applications and benefits in resource poor environment. These include but are not limited to short hospital stay, reduced cost of care, and reduced morbidity, especially related to post operative infections. There is growing interest in MISTs in most low and middle income countries (LMIC) but its adoption has remained limited largely due to high cost of initial set-up, lack of technological backup and limited access to training among others. One of the most limiting factors is the maintenance of the vision system. An affordable laparoscopic set-up as an example will therefore go a long way in improving access to MISTs. Methods and Procedures: A common zero-degrees 10 mm scope is attached on the camera of a low price smartphone (Samsung Galaxy J3 2016, Samsung\u00ae, Seoul, South Korea). Two elastic bands are used to fix the scope right in front of the main camera on the smartphone. The device is covered with sterile transparent drapes (Tegaderm\u00ae, 3M Corporate, St. Paul, MN, USA). A light source is connected with a fiber optic cable for endoscopic use. The image can be seen in real time on a common TV screen through an HDMI connection to the smartphone, with a sterile drape. Holding the vision system through the scope would guarantee to keep the camera in place without issues. To operate in full screen the vision was digitally zoomed at 91.6, without losing quality (that is more related to the intensity of the light). As a collateral project we built a low cost simulator training box with the same camera to train the surgeon, obtaining a high fidelity and affordable simulation setting. Results: We were able to perform the 5 tasks of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery curriculum using our vision system with proficiency. In a pig model, we performed a tubal ligation to simulate an appendectomy and we were able to perform basic laparoscopic suturing. No major issue were encountered and small adjustment only were required to have an acceptable, stable and clear view.",

However, this cost may be extracted in terms of greater pain or longer recovery time for patients, which may outweigh the benefits. Further data is needed to study pain, long term outcomes, and return to work. Introduction: Minimally invasive surgery relies on optimal camera control for the successful execution of operations. One disadvantage of laparoscopic surgery is that camera control is dependent on a surgical assistant's interpretation of visual cues and ability to predict the next field of focus in addition to verbal commands from the operating physician to provide the optimal view. Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery provides the operating surgeon the advantage of dictating their field of view. This study aims to utilize a video processing algorithm to determine the incidence of improperly centered field of view in laparoscopic vs. robot-assisted surgery.",

However, community surgeons raised concern for possible entrainment of room air, including oxygen (02), with these systems. This study seeks to quantify O 2 and non-medical air entrainment by a laparoscopic valveless cannula system to understand the risk of intraoperative air embolism. A communityuniversity collaborative was created to design a model and test this hypothesis. Methods: An artificial abdomen was developed and calibrated to equivalent compliance and intraoperative volume of an average adult abdomen. It was connected to a flow meter, oxygen concentration sensor, and commercially available laparoscopic valveless cannula system. Background: Further advance of near-infrared (NIR) imaging capability into greater clinical usefulness will be helped by the development of new targetable agents. To avoid issues related to dose timing and contamination, compounds that become fluorescent only at the site being targeted would be a significant advance. Here we build on earlier laboratory work to show step-wise advance of the agent towards clinical trialling. Methods: A novel agent (NIR-AZA) was tested in ex vivo colorectal specimens using two commercially available systems to determine characteristics in biological tissue. It was then trialled in a large animal cohort (n=4) to determine its performance for both intestinal perfusion assessment and lymph node mapping (both stomach and colon) using again a commercially available optical imaging system and including a direct comparison with indocyanine green. Results: The novel agent was easily detectable in biological tissue in the near infrared wavelength relevant to commercial instrumentation both as a local depot tattoo and as a lymphatic tracing agent. Porcine model trialling again showing excellent detection and tracking characteristics both in the circulation and in gastrointestinal tissue with clear tracking to relevant lymph nodes within minutes evident with the latter. While these studies were non-survival, there was no evidence of local tissue or systemic system toxicity in any case. Direct qualitative and quantificative comparison between in situ NIR-AZA and ICG at both intestinal and lymph basin regions showed similar levels of fluorescence. Conclusion: The trial compound underwent successful testing indicating proof of earlier projected potential. This is encouraging for further work to advance to first in human testing. Introduction: Enhanced imaging systems have been developed to alter laparoscopic camera output to facilitate visualization during laparoscopic surgery using several novel imaging modes: Clara mode reduces overexposure and reflections while brightening darker areas of the image; Chroma mode intensifies color contrast to more clearly delineate blood vessels; and a combined Chroma-Clara mode. The IES also allows the surgeon to change imaging modes throughout the procedure as needed to facilitate different portions of the operation. We hypothesized that this technology would enhance visualization of critical structures during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) compared to standard laparoscopic imaging. Methods: Videos and still images from an IES (Karl Storz Endoscopy) were assessed in 12 patients undergoing LC using the four imaging modalities. Three time points were assessed: 1) after adhesions were taken down but before any other dissection; 2) after partial dissection of the hepatocystic triangle; and 3) after establishment of the critical view of safety (CVS). Seven surgeons blinded to the imaging modalities ranked each modality from 1 (best) to 4 (worst) for each of 36 time points (3 dissection points for 12 cases). Structures identified on achievement of the CVS were also analyzed. All statistics were performed using SPSS. Rank data was analyzed with the Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests.",

Individual surgeon preferences varied; four surgeons preferred Chroma-Clara, two preferred Chroma, one preferred Clara, and none preferred the standard mode. In addition, the cystic artery and cystic duct were visible in all cases after achieving the CVS, but the common bile duct was visible in only 13% of cases. Conclusion: Enhanced imaging system technology provides modalities that were significantly preferred over standard laparoscopic imaging on retrospective review of still and video images during LC. Enhanced imaging modalities should be evaluated further to assess their impact on outcomes of LC and other laparoscopic procedures. Introduction: Cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed at an unresectable stage. Endoscopic stent placement is generally performed to release the tumor-induced biliary obstruction. However, stents misplacement and migration, tumor tissue ingrowth and cholangitis are relatively frequent complications. Energy-based techniques (radiofrequency ablation and photodynamic therapy) have been proposed as alternatives or in addition to the stent placement, showing controversial results. The use of laser sources in the ablation of the biliary wall has not been investigated so far. This study aims at the evaluation of the optimal power and exposure time to achieve a controlled circumferential intraluminal laser ablation of the common bile duct (CBD). Methods: Through a laparotomy access, the CBD of 4 pigs was exposed and a small choledocotomy was made. A confocal endomicroscopy (CE) scanning (Cellvizio) was performed through the choledocotomy, after injection of 5 ml of sodium fluorescein. The 1.2 mm diameter circumferentiallyemitting diode laser probe (940 nm wavelength) was introduced in the CBD. Laser ablation was performed at 7 W during 180s (n=2) or 360s (n=2). The power setting was predetermined on preliminary ex-vivo tests on porcine liver specimen. Local temperature control was monitored through a Fiber Bragg Grating, embedded in the laser probe. CE scanning was then repeated. The extent of the ablation was measured on Hematoxilin-Eosin and NADH stained slides.",

Indocyanine green was injected intravenously and the transection location(s) and/or distal rectal stump, if applicable, were re-assessed in fluorescent imaging mode. Results: We experienced 32 LAP ICG-FI cases with colo-rectal cancer patients. Tumor was located at the rectum in 12 of them, at the sigmoid colon in 10, at the transverse colon in 2, at the descending colon in 2, at the ascending colon in 4, and at the cecum in 2. TNM stage was 0-I in 10 patients, II in 9, III in 8, and IV in 5. The median (range) age of the patients was 68 (55-77) years with a median (range) BMI of 24.8 (20-36.4) kg/m 2 . The lymph flow was visualized in 30 patients (94%) intraoperatively. However, a high-quality intraoperative ICG lymphangiogram was achieved in 22 patients (73%). In high-quality lymphangiogram, the lymphatic ducts and lymph nodes were clearly visualized in real time, and this proved useful in keeping an intact visceral fascial layer as well as in making a suitable mesentery division line even in the BMI[30 patients. A high-quality intraoperative ICG angiogram was achieved in all patients. Anastomotic perfusion was satisfactory in all cases. In 2 patients (6.3%), the use of NIR+ICG resulted in revision of the proximal colonic transection point before formation of the anastomosis. There were no postoperative anastomotic leakages.

Conventionally, surgical procedures have been performed based on surgeon's subjective decisions and skills, so called \"tacit knowledge\". For the purpose of objective analysis of laparoscopic procedures in video data, automatic recognition of surgical tools and understanding of surgical workflow must be the first critical step. We used convolutional neural network (CNN) which is the current trend in machine learning and computer vision tasks. Methods: Using video database of laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy in our institute, we performed annotation of tools and phases in every frame of the operating videos. For the tool detection, we annotated bounding boxes for both left and right tools in the videos. Furthermore, phase annotation was performed by watching the videos in consultation with laparoscopic surgeons.

Extensive mobilization and retroileal routing is sometimes necessary to create a tension-free anastomosis. Retroileal routing is a technique in which a window is created in the ilieocolic mesentery. The colon is routed through this window, beneath the ileum, prior to entering the pelvis. Retroileal routing is uncommon and there is no data on this technique when performed in using a hand-assisted laparoscopic technique. The aim of this study was to review our experience with hand-assisted laparoscopic left sided colon resections including retroileal routing of the proximal colon to the rectum.

Our interventional radiology colleagues percutaneously accessed the perigastric collection with a wire and a straight catheter was guided through the gastric wall defect and advanced over the wire until it was intraluminal. The surgeon then placed an endoscope down to the level of the gastric defect. The wire was then retrieved by the endoscope achieving percutaneo-oral wire access. The biologic tissue matrix was then measured and cut to a square and inverted into a cone like structure with a flat straight piece on the open end. The cone patch was then secured to the wire with 0 braided polyglactin suture loop. The wire was then withdrawn back through the gastric defect pulling the plug and patch into position and placement was confirmed by endoscopy. Results: We attempted closure of a gastric leak arising after bariatric surgery in six patients. Five underwent successful deployment while one had premature disconnection of the plug from the wire and could not be deployed. The five who had successful deployment had immediate success and within days resumed enteral intake of liquids and resolution of the leak. Two of the six patients additionally underwent covered stent placement to stent a stenotic area at the incisura angularis from the esophagus to the antrum. This stent was typically removed 1-2 weeks later. There were no complications related to the procedure or the plug. Only one patient has undergone repeat endoscopy to evaluate the status of the plug.

We recommend that these endoscopic techniques be used to close gastric defects prior to operative intervention. Introduction: Laparoscopic surgery has spread worldwide and become a standard procedure among many abdominal surgical fields. The incidence of postoperative adhesion, which is a typical postoperative complication, is considered low compared with that after laparotomy, but once complications develop, such as adhesion-induced intestinal obstruction and chronic abdominal pain, the low-invasiveness of laparoscopic surgery may decrease markedly. While we have previously used a sheet-type absorbable barrier to prevent adhesion, it requires a technique in many cases when it is applied in the abdominal cavity. In this study, we used a spray-type absorbable barrier, which is considered simple to apply, as an adhesion-preventing absorbable barrier following laparoscopic surgery. Subjects and Methods: A spray-type absorbable barrier for prevention of adhesion (Ad Spray type L\u00ae) was applied to the dissected surface, port region, and beneath the small incised wound in 5 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery of the large intestine after February 2017. The nozzle is long (334 mm in length) and the angle of the tip is adjustable to some extent, so that the spray could be applied easily to the target region, even in areas in which it would be difficult to secure a work space, by rotating the shaft and finely adjusting the angle of the tip. In order for the barrier to remain in the target region, this preparation must remain viscous after application. Discussion: Approaches for the insertion and affixing of a conventional sheet-type absorbable barrier for the prevention of adhesion has been reported previously by various researchers. The adhesion-preventing absorbable barrier used in this study was a spray type with a long nozzle, which may have been useful because it made the laparoscopic application easy. However, its application requires some experience and time for preparation compared with the use of the sheet type, which could be disadvantageous. Further accumulation of cases, including evaluation of prevention of adhesion after use of the adhesion-preventing absorbable barrier may be necessary.",

Macroscopic observation was done at a distance followed by microscopic observation in contact with tissue. First, we observed the operative field macroscopically. We then observed the serosa of the small intestine microscopically, and effects of blood flow occlusion were studied. Results: ( fig.1 and fig.2 ) The same visual field as ordinary laparoscopy was achieved during macroscopic observation, while using microscopic observation it was possible to observe the complex peristaltic movements of the intestine. The minute blood vessels of the visceral peritoneum and larger, deeper blood vessels were also observed. When the mesenteric vessels were occluded, changes in peristaltic movement were seen directly. Congestion in blood vessels in the deep layers of the serosa was observed. Improvement in peristalsis and congestion were confirmed by restoring blood flow.",

Although optical imaging using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence has been used for visualization of anatomic structures and physiologic functions in open and minimally invasive surgeries, its efficacy and adoption remain suboptimal due to the lack of specificity and sensitivity. Herein, we report a novel class of compounds, which are exclusively metabolized in liver or kidney, rapidly excreted into to biliary or urinary systems, and emitted two different NIR fluorescence spectrums. Methods: Novel, water-soluble heptamethine cyanines; Compound X (biliary) and Compound Y (urinary), unreactive towards gluthathione and the cellular proteome were synthesized, and visualized using real-time, dual-color NIR imaging device. Sprague-dawley rats (n=12) and Yorkshire pigs (n= 9) were used to demonstrate and validate its usefulness, distributed into a control group (ICG; rat n=3, IRDye800CW rat n=3), a biliary group (Compound X; rat n=3, pig n=3), a urinary group (Compound Y; rat n=3, pig n=3), and dual-labeling group (Compound X&Y; rat n=3, pig n=3). Each rat and pig received one or two of the compounds at optimized dose of 0.09-mg/kg intravenously, fluorescence signals and bio-distributions were monitored and recorded over time. The target to background ratio (TBR) was calculated in each target systems and compared to assess sensitivity and specificity. Results: Compound X was rapidly cleared from liver within 15 min after intravenous injection while the fluorescence signals in biliary system lasted up to 1 h both in rats and pigs. Compound Y showed significant renal excretion up to 4 h and the urinary signals remained up to 2 h. They were both highly specific to target organs with TBR values of 4.23 (biliary), 6.32 (urinary) and 1.23 (cf. ICG) at peak signals. These new compounds have approximately 2-3 times higher quantum yields than ICG and 1.75-2.5 times higher specificity to kidney and liver than IRDye800CW. One-way ANOVA showed significant differences between control, biliary, and urinary group (p\\0.0001.) Dual-labeling results also showed a complete separation of these two metabolic systems (p=0.008) and a real-time display of these two systems were clearly visualized with pseudo-colored labeling inside the animal body. Conclusion: We report a new generation of organ-specific, real-time fluorescent markers for intraoperative visualization, navigation and potential geo-fencing. These new compounds have significantly higher quantum yields and higher specificity to visualize kidney and/or liver than any currently available reagents. Background: Porcine models have been widely accepted for gastrointestinal surgery studies, due to their similarities to human anatomy, histology and physiology. Devices such as laparoscopic staplers have been widely used in bariatrics and are currently the cornerstone of bariatric. There are currently few published articles regarding surgical stapler testing in porcine models by means of a survival design. The purpose of this study is to present a new model for stapler testing in porcines. We present the following study in which we asses a novel stapler's feasibility and safety, and its compatibility to currently used stapler reloads. This novel stapler, the AEON\u2122 Endoscopic Linear Stapler (Lexington Medical Inc., Billerica, MA. Pending FDA approval), has been previously tested In-Vitro and In-Vivo by the Lexington Medical engineering department in matters of mechanical function, staple line bursting pressure, staple formation and hemostasis. Duffy et al. used this instrument for small bowel anastomoses in a two-week survival study in porcine models. Methods and Procedures: Four porcine animal model was used under IACUC protocol for a 29-day survival study held at the FIU (Doral, FL, U.S.A) research facility. All animals underwent sleeve gastrectomy using the novel stapler handle, combined with the Endo GIA\u2122 (Medtronic, Mansfield, MA) 4 mm-staple reloads in two of the animals and AEON\u2122 4 mm-staple reloads in the remaining two. No reinforcements or oversewing of the staple line was done. These procedures were performed by two bariatric surgeons. Animals were monitored perioperatively by the facility staff as per protocol. The animals were euthanized at day 29. Post-mortem assessments were done blindly. Gross evaluation and comparison of the gastric tube and their staple lines was done, as well as patency, strictures, and staple line integrity. Results: Stapler function was equivalent with both reload brands, no technical issues were encountered. 3-5 firings were used per animal. No intraoperative complications related to stapler function ensued. No postoperative complications were encountered. All animals survived the full length of the study-29 days. All sleeves were patent, no strictures or bowel obstruction were present. Conclusions: In an animal survival study, a follow-up period of 4 weeks appears to be a good benchmark for stapler testing. The use of the novel stapler for gastric resections appears feasible and safe. Further studies such as microscopic examination of the staple lines, might help confirm equivalence, safety and feasibility of these products for the sleeve gastrectomy procedure.",

In the colorectal and gynecologic surgery literature, prophylactic ureteral stents appear to increase the ability to detect ureteral injuries while not being shown to prevent such injuries. With the increasingly widespread use of laparoscopy and the robotic platform in complex colorectal and pelvic surgery, the utility of stents remains unclear. One of the limiting factors regarding the use of ureteral stents in minimally invasive surgery is the lack of tactile feedback; the inability of the surgeon to directly palpate the stents. One proposed method to overcome this deficiency has been the use of lighted ureteral stents. Increased operating time, increased cost, and need for specialized equipment are potential drawbacks of lighted stents. An alternative to using lighted stents in minimally-invasive surgery is to directly inject indocyanine green (ICG) into the ureters after cystoscopy-guided placement of ureteral stents. Intraoperative visualization of the ureters is acheived by using either the PINPOINT Endoscopic Fluorescence Imaging System in laparoscopy, or FIREFLY integrated with the robotic platform. It is hoped that the risk of inadvertent ureteral injuries during colorectal and pelvic operations will be minimized using this technique, due to improved visualization of the ureters throughout the procedure.",

Preoperatively, there was concern that the mass would be intimately adherent to, or even invading, the bilateral ureters based on CT scan findings. After ureteral injection of ICG, visualization of both ureters was easily achieved at the time of operation, and the procedure proceeded with careful and safe dissection of the mass with visualization of the ureters at all times. Though there is a paucity of studies evaluating the use of ICG in the laparoscopic modality, this technique was safe, easy to employ, inexpensive and very useful to visualize the ureters intraoperatively. Indeed, larger studies with appropriate sample sizes would help to further validate this novel use of ICG. University of Colorado -Denver, 2 VA Eastern Colorado Healthcare System Introduction: Operating room fires are \"never events\" that expose the patient to the risk of devastating complications. Our group has previously demonstrated that alcohol-based surgical skin preparations fuel operating room fires. Manufacturer guidelines recommend a three-minute delay after application of alcohol-based preps to decrease the risk of prep pooling and surgical fires. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the three-minute dry time in reducing the incidence of surgical fires. Methods and Procedures: A standardized, ex vivo model was used with a 15915 cm section of clipped, porcine skin. Alcohol-based surgical skin preparations tested were 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and 74% IPA with 0.7% iodine povacrylex (Iodine-IPA). Nonalcohol-based solutions included 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% povidone-iodine \"paint.\" An electrosurgical ''Bovie'' pencil was activated for 3 seconds on 30 Watts coagulation mode in 21% oxygen, both immediately and 3 minutes after skin preparation application, with and without solution pooling.",

Alcohol-based preps created flames on immediate testing in 83% (33/40) of cases when pooling was present. Without pooling, flames occurred in 40% (16/40) of cases on immediate testing. After a 3-minute delay, there was no difference in the incidence of fire when pooling was present (33/40 vs. 33/40, p [1) . Similarly, there was no difference when pooling was not present (16/40 vs. 14/40, p=1). (Table 1 ) Conclusions: Alcohol-based surgical skin preparations fuel surgical fires.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of our novel surgical navigation system of immersive holographic mixed reality (MR) using a head-mounted smart glass display HoloLens to enhance spatial awareness of the operating field in laparoscopic surgery. The authors describe a method of registering and overlaying the preoperative MDCT imaging localization of tumors, vessels, and organs onto the real world in the operating theatre through holographic smartglasses in augmented reality (AR). Methods: In this study we included 20 laparoscopic GI, HPB, urology, and gynecologic surgeries using this system. We developed a CT-based patient-specific holographic MR surgical navigating application using HoloLens, that is a pair of see-through monitors built-in head-mounted display. By reconstructing the patient-specific 3D surface polygons of tumors, vessels, and organs out of the patient's MDCT, MR anatomy was displayed on the see-through grasses three-dimensionally during actual surgery. The HoloLens features an inertial measurement unit which includes an accelerometer, gyroscope, and a magnetometer for environment understanding sensors, an energy-efficient depth camera, a photographic video camera, and an ambient light sensor.",

The exact location between surgical devices and patient's anatomy could be traced on the pair of MR smart-glasses by satellite tracking. The gesture controlled manipulation by surgeons' hands with surgical groves was useful for intraoperative anatomical references of tumors and vascular position under sterilized environment. It allowed the user to manipulate the spatial attributes of the virtual and real anatomies. This system reduced the length of the operation and discussion time. This could support complex procedures with the help of pre-and intra-operative imaging with better visualization of the surgical anatomy and spatial awareness with visualization of surgical instruments in relation to anatomical landmarks. Conclusions: The immersive holographic MR system provides a real-time 3D interactive perspective of the inside of the patient, accurately guiding the surgeon. This helps spatial awareness of the surgeons in the operating field and has illustrative benefits in surgical planning, simulation, education, and navigation. Enhancing scene visualization is a feasible strategy for augmenting spatial awareness in laparoscopic surgery.",

A Maryland dissector and a pair of scissors were used for the cutting task. For the suturing task, a Maryland dissector and needle holder were used. Conventional laparoscopic instruments and their equivalent r2 DRIVE instruments were used. The order in the use of the type of instruments was randomized. Execution time and surgeon's ergonomics were assessed. For the latter, surface electromyography (trapezius, deltoid and paravertebral muscles) and the NASA-TLX index were analyzed.

We believe that surgeons need a longer and comprehensive training period with these laparoscopic instruments to reach their full potential in laparoscopic practice. Background/Objectives: 3D printing has been shown to be a useful tool for preoperative planning in various surgical disciplines. However, there are only several single case reports in the field of liver surgery. This is because of problematic visualization of anatomy, difficulties in methodology and-most importantly-high costs limiting implementation of 3D printing. The goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of personalized 3D-printed liver models as routinely used tools in planning and guidance of laparoscopic liver resections. Materials and Methods: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography images of 6 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resections in a single centre were acquired and processed. Proper segmentation algorithms were used to obtain virtual models of anatomical structures, including vessels, tumor, gallbladder and liver parenchyma in STL (stereolithography) format. After processing files, models in parts were subsequently printed with desktop Ultimaker 2+ (Ultimaker, Netherlands) 3D printer, using polylactic acid filaments as printing material. All parts were matched together to create a mold, which was later casted with transparent silicone. Models were delivered to surgical teams prior to the surgery as well as used in patients' education.",

Methods and Procedures: Experiment of thermal spread: Sonicision (Sonic) was used for ultrasonic scissors and LigaSure (LS) was used for bipolar vessel sealing system. Each device was activated in order to cut porcine muscle at room temperature. Temperatures of both the device blade and porcine tissues beside the device were measured using a temperature probe.

This demonstrates the potential for SoMe to facilitate international collaborative research. Background: Despite the technological advancement of a minimally invasive approach to Pylorus -preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), the morbidity is still high. Among the many complications, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is reported in high incidence rate, which varies from researcher to researcher, and a fistula risk score (FRS) has been developed to predict the POPF. The aim of this study is validate the fistula risk score in minimally invasive approach of PPPD and find the other meaningful parameter for prediction of POPF. Method and Materials: From January 2008 to August 2017, laparoscopy attempted right-sided pancreas resection was performed on 142 patients including robotic reconstruction in the Division of Hepatobiliary and pancreas at Yonsei University Health System. Among them, 43 patients were excluded due to total pancreatectomy (N=15), open conversion (N=12), pancreaticogastrostomy and hybrid manual anastomosis (N=12), non-measurable drain and missing datas (N=4 Conclusions: Fistula risk score is significant prediction factor of POPF including biochemical leaks. In addition to the previously known FRS variables, our data showed that BMI is an important predictor of POPF with clinical relavancy in a minimally invasive approach of PPPD.",

Major liver resection such as anatomical left or right hemi-hepatectomy has also been introduced in many centers. Herein, we evaluate surgical results of laparoscopic hemi-hepatectomy for liver tumor. Patients and Methods: Until March 2017, 27 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic or laparoscope-assisted hemi-hepatectomy (left: 18, right: 9) were reviewed and the surgical data such as operation time, blood loss, postoperative complications were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Of the 18 patients underwent left hemi-hepatectomy, 6 cases were primary liver cancer, 6 cases were metastatic tumor, and 6 cases were benign tumor. Pure laparoscopic surgery was performed in 5 cases. The mean blood loss was 203 (30-995) ml, mean operating time was 315 (204-578) minutes and mean postoperative hospital stay was 18 (8-52) days. The rate of postoperative complications was 5.6% (wound infection; n=1). All right hemi-hepatectomy was performed by laparoscope-assisted method. Of the 9 patients underwent right hemi-hepatectomy, 3 cases were primary liver cancer, 3 cases were metastatic tumor, and 3 cases were benign tumor. The mean blood loss was 188 (10-600) ml, mean operating time was 382 (290-514) minutes and mean postoperative hospital stay was 19 (8-48) days. The rate of postoperative complications was 22.2% (biliary stenosis; n=2). The patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were followed up for a median of 68 (29-92) months. Recurrence occurred in 4 cases and none of them had died at the time of follow-up. Conclusion: Laparoscopic hemi-hepatectomy is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of benign and malignant liver tumors.",

Each treatment has its own merits and associatied complications. Laparoscopic unroofing (fenestration) offers the best balance between efficacy and safety. Polycystic liver disese (PCLD) treatment by this method are less clear because of high failure rate. Liver resection though more effective carries higher risks. Treatment of hydatid disease are controversial. Materials and Method: Simple cyst may be asymptomatic and picked up as incidental findings on ultrasound examination for other abdominal complaints. Few cyst have symptoms of mass effect or with complication effect due to haemorrage, rupture, infection. On examination liver is palpable. Compression over bile duct give rise to jaundice. The commonest symptoms are pain, early satiety, nausea and vomiting. Simple cyst are more common in female after 50 years of age. The cyst located antriorly inferiorly and laterally are the ideal case. Investigation like ultrasonography is important. It will helps us to detect the cyst nature, will help to differentiate bet ween simple cyst from poly cystic liver disease, from neoplastic liver. In endemic area of hydatid liver disease serological test is mandatory. CT scan is important regarding details information about to localise the cyst, to identify the liver tissue arroud the cyst, relationship of cyst with the nearby vital structures, number of cyst, calcification and carcinomatous changes in its wall. Aspiration of cystfluid, biological and cytological examination to rule out the presence of infection, biliary communication and malignancy. Recently, CA 19-9 estimation is helpful for the differentiating the simple cyst from the cystadenoma or carcinoma. For jaundice patient ERCP is impotant to locate the intraductal polyp causing the biliary obstruction or cyst causes the compression of the biliary tree. For bleeding in cyst MRI is helpful. Carcinoma at epithelial lining may occur. Result: Laparoscopic de-roofing (fenestration) less radical procedure ensures adequate drainage of cyst content into the peritoneal cavity. The cyst wall can be removed using harmonic scalpel so smoked produced and fogging of lens can be minimized. The interior surface inspected with care to exclude neoplastic growth and biliary communication. Whole operative procedure, duration of postoperative recovery, hospital stay is much shorter in this procedure. Large cevron incision can be avoided. No recurrence in two years follow up period. Liver resection and total cystectomy theoretically minimizes the recurrence risk but invoke the a real risk of postoperative complications and death. Conclusion: Careful case selection and meticulous surgical skills are the two major determinants of the outcome. In the LLR group, the first port was placed with an Alexis\u00ae wound retractor (Applied Medical, USA) and Free Access\u00ae (TOP Corporation, Japan) at the abdominal defect made by previous SC.

It accounts for only 0.4% of all extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 0.016 % of all cases of non-Hodgkin disease. The diagnosis is made when there is only liver involvement or when there is minimal non-liver disease. Bone marrow, spleen, or hematologic affection should be excluded to confirm the diagnosis. We present our experience with two PHL's that were correctly diagnosed thanks to laparoscopic liver biopsy. 67-year-old male admitted because of a 2-month history of right upper quadrant pain and nonmeasured weight loss. Liver function tests and cholestasic enzymes showed normal values. Serologic tests showed negative results for both HBV (hepatitis B virus) and HCV (hepatitis C virus). CT (computed tomography) scan showed three intrahepatic lesions in segments V, VI, and VII. CT-guided fine needle did not reach the diagnosis so a laparoscopic hepatic biopsy was performed. The final diagnosis was Burkitt-like lymphoma. Chemotherapy with R-CHOP (rutiximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone) modality was started and completed after 6 cycles. It is currently 2 years since the patient was diagnosed and there are no clinical or radiological signs of recurrence. 54-year-old male who complained of diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Chronic HB infection with no viral charge was detected. Ultrasound showed heterogeneity of the whole left hepatic lobe and an MRI was performed. A ten by segen centimeters lesion occupying the left hepatic lobe enhanced in arterial phase was seen suggesting adenoma. Laparoscopic hepatic biopsy was completed to reach a definitive diagnosis. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma follicular type has just been confirmed with the histology and immuno-histochemistry. Chemotherapy with R-CHOP should be started in the following weeks. PHL's diagnosis is hard to achieve. Fine needle biopsies are frequently negative because of the large area of necrosis. Surgical biopsies are sometimes indispensable to get enough tissue to reach the diagnosis. PHLs are sometimes misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma because of its relation to HCV meaning a major hepatic resection. That is the reason why we consider that all diagnostic measures should be undertaken to rule out a different type of tumor. Surgical resection is normally not needed in PHLs; as they are chemosensitive lesions. Surgical options usually add unnecessary morbidity and mortality to these patients. Chemotherapy standard treatment for PHL consists on R-CHOP combination.",

            "text": "Introduction: Solid pseudopapillary tumors are rare neoplasms accounting for 2-3% of pancreatic malignancies with a low risk of recurrence and metastasis. Pancreatic malignancies are less common in pediatric populations, though small case series have identified that pseudopapillary tumors comprise between 20 and 70% of pediatric pancreatic neoplasms. As these tumors have a low risk of metastasis, the mainstay of treatment has remained surgical excision. Several surgical approaches have been described from extensive resections such as pancreaticoduodenectomy to local enucleation. We present a case of enucleation of a large pseudopapillary tumor from the pancreatic head complicated by pancreatic fistula. A literature review was performed given the rarity of this tumor to review surgical approaches, to compare complications and long-term outcomes, and to identify specific strategies to decrease the risk of pancreatic fistula. Case Description: A 13 year-old female presented with 6 months of abdominal pain. Computed tomography identified a right upper quadrant mass felt to be consistent with a lipoma. Follow up CT at 6 months suggested the mass was more likely a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST), and surgical resection was recommended. Enucleation of the mass was chosen in view of a wellcircumscribed appearance, clear operative tissue planes, and concern for long-term morbidity of a more extensive resection given the patient's young age. Pathology demonstrated an 8.5 cm pseudopapillary tumor with negative margins. Her post-operative course was complicated by a grade B pancreatic fistula, managed with nutritional support, external drain maintenance, and endoscopic stenting. The patient achieved healing of the pancreatic fistula after four months. Results: Our literature review demonstrates no difference in recurrence, mortality or morbidity between types of surgery. Pancreatic fistula contributed to the majority of postoperative morbidity in all cases. Recommendations for enucleation include small (2-4 cm) tumors with between 2 and 5 mm margin from the main pancreatic duct. Techniques identified to minimized post-operative pancreatic fistula include preoperative imaging of the duct anatomy, preoperative pancreatic stent placement, and intraoperative ultrasound to identify the pancreatic duct. Some literature supports preservation of pancreatic parenchyma, particularly in younger patients, to reduce endocrine and exocrine dysfunction given the low rates of recurrence and metastasis with this rare neoplasm. Conclusion: Our case demonstrates complications of enucleation of a large pseudopapillary tumor with successful multidisciplinary post-operative management. With the risk reduction strategies identified, we suggest that enucleation may be considered for pseudopapillary tumors in younger patients to preserve pancreatic parenchyma and long-term pancreatic function. Introduction: Recent advancements in minimally invasive techniques led to increased effort and interest in laparoscopic pancreatic surgery. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a widely accepted procedure for left-sided pancreatic lesions. In other cases, the adoption of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy has been hindered by the technical complexity of laparoscopic reconstruction. Hybrid laparoscopy-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy (HLAPD) in which pancreaticoduodenal resection is performed laparoscopically, while reconstruction is completed via a small upper midline minilaparotomy, is combines the efficacy of open approach, and the benefits of laparoscopic approach. The purpose of this study is to report our experience of HLAPD and to define the learning curves.",

Pancreatic stump leak and fistula formation are significant causes of morbidity in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy (DP), with incidence of 15% to as high as 64% in a large systematic review. We present a case of a 58 year old female, four months status post distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy for pseudopapillary neoplasm of pancreatic tail. Patient presented to our institution with 7 day history of left upper quadrant pain and general malaise. Differential diagnosis on admission was abdominal wall abscess vs incarcerated incisional hernia. Physical exam was positive for severe tenderness to palpation over a *4 cm94 cm non reducible mass in left upper quadrant with surrounding skin erythema. Patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy and intraoperative findings revealed extensive adhesions to the anterior abdominal wall and a loop of small bowel was found adhered to the previous incision site in left upper quadrant. Upon further dissection we entered a large 1098 cm cavity with saponified caseous material. The saponified material and thick tan fluid were evacuated into an endocatch bag and two large bore Jackson pratt drains were left within the cavity. Further examination showed that the small intestine was normal with no signs of obstruction or ischemia. Fluid studies and cultures were sent and showed yeast like organisms and negative for acid fast bacillus. We report an unusual presentation of a distal pancreatectomy stump leak in the formation of an intra-abdominal saponified fluid collection four months after the primary procedure. Given the high incidence of pancreatic stump leak and fistula formation after distal pancreatectomy, much effort has been made to identify factors associated with higher incidence of leaks and their usual and unusual presentations, which will be reviewed in this report. Initial concerns regarding healthy donor's safety and graft integrity, need for acquiring surgical expertise in both laparoscopic liver surgery and living donor transplantation (LDLT) have delayed the development of laparoscopic donor hepatectomy in adult-to-adult LDLT. However, decreased blood loss, less postoperative pain, shorter length of stay in hospital, and excellent cosmetic outcome have well been validated as the advantage of laparoscopic hepatectomy. Hence, the safety and feasibility for laparoscopic donor should be further investigated. We present initial experiences and safety for totally laparoscopic living donor right hepatectomy. In 20 cases who received elective living donor right hepatectomy for adult-to-adult LDLT, totally laparoscopic approach was applied from May 2016 up to August 2017. The anatomical variation of portal vein was not considered as an exclusion criteria, but all donors were with Type I portal vein variation. The bile duct anomaly was preoperatively evaluated with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and was never excluded for totally laparoscopic approach. 2D conventional rigid 30\u00ba rigid laparoscopic system was used in 2 cases and the remaining 18 cases used 3D flexible laparoscopic system. In about 40%, hepatic duct anomalies (Type 2, 3a, 3b) were identified. The operation time was from 6 hours to 7 hours. And the time for the graft removal was within 15 minutes. The hepatic duct transection was performed under operative cholangiography via a cystic duct and the patency of left hepatic duct was also confirmed by operative cholangiography. However, during postoperative period, bile leakage was identified in only 1 case and resolved after the biliary stent insertion by ERCP. During operation, there was no transfusion and the inflow control like Pringle maneuver was not used at all. V5 or V8 were reconstructed in 19 cases and large right inferior hepatic vein was prepared for anastomosis in 6 cases. All grafts were removed through the suprapubic transverse incision. Most donors were discharged at 7 days after hepatectomy. During the short-term follow-up period in the donors except this case, complications were not identified. Conclusively, totally laparoscopic right donor hepatectomy in elective adult-to-adult LDLT can be initially attempted after enough experiences of laparoscopic hepatectomy and LDLT. However, the true benefits of totally laparoscopic living donor right hepatectomy should be fully assessed through various experiences from multi-institutes. Background: The role of neoadjuvent chemotherapy on the treatment of pancreatic cancer remains widely controversial. Studies have evaluated its effect on resectability and survival; however, few have studied the consequence of neoadjuvent therapy on surgical outcomes and complications. Methods and Procedures: A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the targeted pancreas module of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Neoadjuvent therapy was defined by chemotherapy and/or radiation in the 30-days before surgery. Patient demographics, operative characteristics, and 30-day outcomes were compared amongst patients undergoing neoadjuvent chemotherapy, radiation, chemoradiation, and no neoadjuvent therapy. Both univariable and multivariable analysis were completed.",

Introduction: Single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH) has been showed feasible and safe in experienced hands for selected patients with benign or malignant liver diseases. There were only small series reported and most of the procedures were minor liver resections. We herein present our experience of SILH during a period of 13 months. Methods and Procedures: Consecutive 13 patients underwent SILH which were performed by two experienced laparoscopic surgeons with straight instruments. Patient characteristics and surgical outcomes were analyzed by reviewing the medical charts. Results: The patient age was 62.7\u00b19.2 (47-78) years with male predominance (8 patients, 61.5 %). Six patients (46.2%) had liver cirrhosis proved by pathologic examinations. Nine procedures (69.2%) were indicated for malignancy. Four major hepatectomies (over two segments) and nine minor ones were performed including seven anatomical resections. The abdominal incisions were para-or trans-umbilical except one which was along the old operative scar at lower midline, while most of them (n=12, 92.3%) was within 5 cm in length. Inflow control was carried out by either individual hilar dissection or extraglissonian approach instead of Pringle maneuver. The operations were all accomplished successfully without additional ports or open conversion. The operative time was 436.5\u00b1178.4 (163-673) min and the estimated blood loss was 435.0\u00b1377.2 (75-1400) mL. Five (38.5 %) patients encountered complications and four of them were classified as Clavien-Dindo grade I. The postoperative length of hospital stay was 6.1\u00b12.2 (4-10) days.

Methods: We reviewed data for all consecutive patients undergoing LDP for left-sided PDAC at Asan Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) between April 2006 and December 2016. The patients who underwent laparoscopic extended panreatectomy with en-bloc resection of adjacent organs or major vessels were included in analyses. Results: Of total 257 patients, 21 underwent laparoscopic extended pancreatectomy. There were 14 male and 7 female patients with a median age of 64.1 years. Resected adjacent organs or vessels were as following: stomach in 6, duodenum in 1, colon in 4, kidney in 2, superior mesenteric vein in 4, and celiac axis in 4. Median operative duration was 280 minutes, and median length of hospital stay was 9 days. Pathological reports revealed the following: a median tumor size of 3.5 cm, the tumor differentiation (well differentiated in 2, moderately differentiated in 17, and poorly differentiated in 2), T stages (T1 in 1, T3 in 18, and T4 in 2) , and N stages (N0 in 10 and N1 in 11). R0 resection was achieved in 6 patients, and most R1 resection were tangential retroperitoneal margins. Postoperatively, clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula was occured in 2 patients, and there was no 90-day mortality. Median overall survival was 19.6 months and 1 year survival rate was 71.1%. Conclusions: Although laparoscopic surgery has limitations in treating extensive diseases, some selected patients can be applicable for laparoscopic extended pancreatectomy with acceptable complication and survival rates. who underwent hepatic resection was included. These patients were divided into LLR or OLR. Demographics, tumor characteristics, recurrence rates and over-all survival were compared between the 2 groups. Results: 49 patients were included and grouped into LLR (n=28) and OLR (n=21). The average tumor number was 2\u00b11 for both groups, while the mean tumor size was 4.1 cm and 4.9 cm for the LLR and OLR group, respectively. When compared with OLR, LLR had lower post-operative complication rates (14.3% vs 33.3%, p=0.118) and shorter hospital stay (9 vs 21 days, p=0.103), although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall, recurrence-free and disease-free survival was comparable between LLR and OLR. Introduction: Single port surgery has been described since 2009 with cholecystectomy, colectomy, gastrectomy, and others. Nevertheless, few cases are still reported in field of HBP surgery. Herein, we report single port pancreatic surgery developed from our previous experience. We had started single port surgery in 2009, since then we have done more than 850 cases of single port surgery using surgical glove port including cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and colectomy. Because we consider this experience should develop to pancreatic surgery, 73 cases of single port staging laparoscopy for potentially resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer and 15 cases of single port plus one port distal pancreatectomy (SPOP-DP) have been done in our institution. Single port staging laparoscopy for pancreatic cancer. Resectability was proved in 63 (86%) out of 73 patients while 10 patents had unresectale factor such as small liver and peritoneal metastases that was not able to detect pre-operatively.

Introduction: Scoring systems (SS) are an essential pillar of care in acute pancreatitis (AP) management. We compared six SS (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE-II), Bedside Index for Severity in AP (BISAP), Glasgow score, Harmless AP score (HAPS), Ranson's score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score) for their utility in predicting severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. Methods: AP patients treated between July 2009 and September 2016 were studied retrospectively. Demographic profile, clinical presentation and discharge outcomes were recorded.

Open necrosectomy is associated with higher morbidity (95%) and mortality (25%). Endoscopic necrosectomy often is tolerated well but associated with stent migration and multiple procedures. Video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement is tolerated well but associated with severe bleeding if adjacent blood vessels are injured during the procedure leading to severe complications. Methods: In our series, We perform a step up approach by involvement of a multidisciplinary group consisting of general surgeons, gastroenterologists, Infectious disease physicians, critical care internalist, interventional radiologist and nutritional services to formulate a management plan. The necrotized pancreas is initially drained with an IR guided drain, fluid cultures sent for microbiology and treatment with appropriate antibiotics if deemed necessary. The drain is gradually upsized to a 24 Fr sized drain to form a well-defined tract for surgical debridement; A preoperative CT scan of the abdomen with IV contrast to access the location and proximity of the vasculature around the necrotized pancreas. A collaboration with the interventional radiologist to discuss possible IR embolization of splenic artery prior to surgical debridement.

Conclusion: Our preliminary experience demonstrates that an early multidisciplinary plan by various subspecialties can result in a pragmatic and successful approach to this potentially catastrophic condition. Introduction: Liver resection with preservation of as much liver parenchyma as possible is called parenchymal sparing hepatectomy (PSH). PSH has been shown to improve overall survival by increasing the re-resection rate in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and recurrence. The caudal-cranial perspective in laparoscopy makes the cranial segments (2, 4a, 7 , and 8) more difficult to access. The objective of this systematic review is to analyze feasibility, safety, morbidity, and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic PSH. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed. Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched. A search strategy was published with the PROSPERO registry. A systematic review was conducted on all cases reported, they were categorized by area of resection and quantitative meta-analysis of operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications, and R0 resection was performed. Results: Of the 351 studies screened for relevance, 48 studies were selected. Because interventions or endpoints were noncontributory or reporting incomplete, 38 were excluded. Only 10 publications remained, reporting data from 579 patients who underwent laparoscopic PSH. The highest Oxford evidence level was 2b and selective reporting bias was common due to single center and noncontrolled reports. Among them, 132 (21.5%) resections were in the cranial segments 2 (1.1%), 4a (5.2%), 7 (6%), and 8 (9.1%), which previously would have required laparoscopic hemi-hepatectomies or sectorectomies. The most common tumor type was CRLM (58%) and the second most common tumor type was hepatocellular carcinoma (16%). Feasibility of laparoscopic PSH was 93%, conversion rate was 7%, and complications were seen in 17% of cases. No perioperative mortality was reported. No standardized reporting format for complications was used across studies. Meta-analysis revealed a weighted average operating time of 385 minutes, estimated blood loss of 463 cc, and length of stay of 8 days. R0 resections were achieved in 91% of cases. Conclusion: Laparoscopic PSH of difficult to reach liver tumors are feasible with acceptable conversion and complication rate, but relatively long operating times and relatively high blood loss. In future studies, data on long term survival and specific tumor type recurrence should be reported and bias reduced.",

Methods: Patients aged 18 years or older who underwent liver surgery for benign liver tumors from 2010 to 2014 were identified in the Nationwide Readmissions Database. Patients were compared based on liver pathology, resection versus ablation, and an open versus laparoscopic/robotic approach. The outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay (LOS) [7 days, and readmission within 30-days. Univariable analysis was performed for these outcomes and multivariable logistic regression was performed using the variables with a p-value \\0.05 on univariable analysis. Results were weighted for national estimates.",

This study aims to identify and categorize the differences in techniques and assess the need for guidelines in this field. Case Description: Surgeons were surveyed on the techniques they employ on biweekly basis using the International Bariatric Club Facebook group. The survey included sleeve staple line reinforcement, preoperative work up, intraoperative hiatal dissection, bougie size, distance from pylorus to distal staple line, and intraoperative leak testing. Surveys were conducted between May 2017 and July 2017. Each survey was active for 2 weeks after which data was collected. Participants were required to select a single answer per question. Discussion: When surveyed on staple line reinforcement (n=305), 122 surgeons used no reinforcement, 103 over-sewed, 43 buttressed, 19 clipped as necessary, 10 over-sewed as necessary. For preoperative work up (n=188), 125 utilized routine endoscopy, 9 routinely obtained upper GI series, 2 routinely obtained both endoscopy and upper GI, and 43 employed endoscopy or upper GI series only in patients who were symptomatic. For hiatal dissection (n=168), 14 surgeons dissected the hiatus routinely, 116 dissected only when obvious hernias intraoperatively, 32 dissected only if the hernia was detected on preoperative work up, and 1 dissected in the setting of GERD symptoms. For sleeve caliber sizing (n=275), bougie \\32 F was used by 1 surgeon, bougie size 32F, 34F, 36F were utilized by 86, bougie size 38F and 40F were utilized by 171, bougie[40F were used by 4, and gastroscopes (34F) were used by 9. With regards to distance from pylorus to where the sleeve staple line was initiated (n=207), 44 participants started \\4 cm away from pylorus, 159 between 4 and 6 cm, and 4 started [6 cm from pylorus.

Introduction: Sleeve gastrectomy has become the most performed bariatric surgery. Removing part of the stomach causes weight loss by restricting food intake and regulating the production of incretins, particularly ghrelin. However, prognostic factors to weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy have been difficult to find. The goal of this research was to study the correlation between the volume of resected stomach and weight loss. Methods and Procedures: Volume of resected stomach of 217 patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy was measured. A standard laparoscopic technique was used. Calibration was performed tightly around a 28 Fr bougie, and stapling started 4-6 cm from the pylorus. The standardized technique for measurement involved insufflation with a 14G catheter with saline solution to a pressure of 18 cm H2O immediately after removal of the specimen. Resected stomach's volume, gender, age, BMI, height and % of total weight loss (%TWL) at 6 months and 1 year were prospectively recorded. Correlation between variables was analyzed with Pearson's test and linear regression models. Conclusion: Removed stomach was larger on men than women and its size slightly correlated to height. However, volume of resected stomach did not seem to have an incidence on short termweight loss. Gastric size should not be considered as a prognostic factor for weight loss in patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy.",

However, inadequate weight-loss may present the need for a revisional procedure. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic re-sleeve gastrectomy (LRSG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and gastric mini-bypass surgery (MGBP) in attaining successful weight loss following initial LSG. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients who underwent LSG at Amiri and Royale Hayat Hospital, Kuwait from 2008 to 2017. A list was obtained of those who underwent revisional bariatric surgery after initial LSG, and their demographics were analyzed. Introduction: The aim of this study is to identify potential risk factors or early indicators, specifically related to perioperative blood pressure, and its association with perioperative hemorrhage in the bariatric population. Laparoscopic bariatric surgery in the United States has been steadily increasing over the past several years. Between 2011 and 2015, the annual number of cases has increased by 24%. Although rare, hemorrhagic complications (HC) occur at a rate of 1-5% and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. By identifying factors which may place a patient at higher chance of HC, surgeons can potentially mitigate those risks. These modifications could reduce morbidity and limit the requirement of transfusions or reoperations. Methods and Procedures: A retrospective case-control series was performed to include all patients who underwent either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GB) in 2016 at a single bariatric center of excellence. A total of 8 patients were identified with perioperative HC. Each patient was matched 2:1 for procedure, body mass index, and medical comorbidities. Peak systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were compared between groups at time of admission, intraoperative, and during remainder of initial hospital stay. Welch's T-tests were used for comparison between groups.",

However, there remains a need to investigate factors which may successfully predict preoperative weight loss among bariatric patients. Methods and Procedures: This analysis included patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy, or gastric banding at an academic medical center in California. Data were measured at patients' consult and preoperative clinical visits. Preoperative weight loss outcomes were categorized as follows: no weight loss, lost weight, or gained weight. Associations between categorical sociodemographic and surgical characteristics and preoperative weight loss outcomes were assessed using the Chi-Square Test of Association. Associations between continuous measures and preoperative weight loss outcomes were assessed using ANOVA. A sub-group analysis was completed among participants who lost weight prior to bariatric surgery. Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate associations between patient characteristics and the number of pounds lost. Results: Patients (n=2,597) were predominately ages 45-65 (56%), female (80%), White (53%), and privately insured (68%). Patient race was significantly associated with weight loss outcomes (p =0.013): whereas 62% of White patients lost weight prior to surgery, only 54% of Black patients lost preoperative weight. Among privately insured patients, 59% lost weight. In contrast, 64% of patients insured by Medi-Cal/Medicaid lost weight (p=0.049). On average, lower baseline excess body weight was associated with no weight loss. Patients who lost preoperative weight (n=1,570) were included in the sub-group analysis. Male sex (p\\.001), Black race (p\\0.001), undergoing laparoscopic RYGB (p=0.003), no previous abdominal surgeries (p=0.038), upper tertile baseline weight (p\\0.0001), waist circumference (p\\.0001), percent body fat (p\\.01), BMI (p\\0.0001), excess body weight (p\\0.0001), and systolic blood pressure (p=0.001) were associated with more pounds lost.",

            "text": "Bariatric surgery is gaining popularity not only for its weight loss benefits, but also for its metabolic effects. We present a 44-year-old female patient with symptoms of neuroglycopenia, occurring 11-years post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. During one of her syncopal episodes, her blood sugar was noted to be 21 mg/dL. Continuous glucose monitoring demonstrated post prandial hypoglycemia, averaging 4 episodes per day, with a maximum of 6 episodes in one day. Upon further evaluation, the lab results of the HbA1c, chromogranin A, somatostatin, and urinary sulfonylurea levels were all normal, with the C-peptide level within the upper limit of normal. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not show any obvious masses in the pancreas, and since the chromogranin A level was normal, it lead to the empiric diagnosis of nesidioblastosis by exclusion. We placed the patient initially on medical management which included a carbohydrate restricted diet of 30 g per meal, eating 6-8 small meals per day, and taking 50 mg of acarbose three times per day. Overall, symptoms have improved, and she has 1-2 episodes per month, compared with about 4 episodes per day. We will also present the data with regards to other invasive treatment options, which are available when medical treatment options have failed, such as gastric bypass reversal versus distal gastrectomy. Vertical banded gastroplasties (VBGs) were a common bariatric procedure in the 1980s but have largely fallen out of favor due to unsatisfactory weight loss and a relatively high incidence of longterm complications such as dysphagia and severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One of the ways to address these undesirable effects is to convert to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of VBG-to-RYGB conversion. Outcomes of VBG revisions performed at an academic center between 2008 and 2017 were reviewed. Of the 54 VBG revisions, gastrogastrostomies were created in two patients, two underwent a planned 2-stage conversion, and 50 VBGs were converted to RYGBs. Patients were operated on an average of 24 years after their initial VBG. Presenting symptoms were weight regain (n=30, 55.6%), dysphagia (n=29, 53.7%), or severe GERD (n=23, 42.6%). Fourteen patients (26%) had a gastric staple line dehiscence. Of the 50 VBG to RYGB conversions, 39 were laparoscopic, 5 were converted to open, 4 were open, and 2 were robotic-assisted. Average operative time and length of hospital stay were 305.4 minutes and 9.2 days, respectively. Within the first 3 months post-operatively, twelve (24%) patients required readmission directly related to surgery, while eight (16%) visited the emergency department. Eight patients (16%) required at least one unplanned operation due to complication(s) during the entire follow-up: small bowel obstruction (n=3, at 1-week, 12-months, and 14-months), necrosis/leak of remnant stomach requiring remnant gastrectomy (n=3), tracheostomy for prolonged respiratory failure (n=2), bleeding (n=1), anastomotic leak (n=1), and hemothorax requiring VATS (n=1). Four patients (8%) had a contained perforation that was medically managed and five (10%) developed a gastrojejunal anastomosis stricture requiring endoscopic intervention. One patient (1.8%) developed pulmonary embolism. There was no mortality directly related to surgery. Complete resolution or improvement of GERD/dysphagia was appreciated in all patients in the short term follow-up. Patients who presented with weight regain had a mean BMI loss of 13.2\u00b18.2 points in the median follow-up time of 8.5 months up to a year after conversion to RYGB. In summary, reoperative bariatric surgeries after VBGs are complex, requiring longer operative times and length of stay. Our study found 16% risk of severe complications requiring reoperations, compared to the previously cited 38% in short and long-term complications. Conversion of VBG to RYGB provides excellent relief of severe GERD and dysphagia and is a viable option for significant weight reduction. Introduction: Bariatric surgery is a safe and effective treatment for severe obesity and its comorbidities. However, concomitant splenectomy is sometimes required due to uncontrolled bleeding during the surgery. Limited literature exists regarding the effects of concurrent splenectomy on outcomes of bariatric surgery. This study aimed to determine these outcomes.",

Introduction: Although much is known regarding medical outcomes of metabolic surgery, less is known regarding quality of life outcomes. We hypothesized that the collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) could help us understand quality of life in this patient population. We chose to primarily use Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments because of their broad applicability, low cost, and ability to use computer-adapted technology to survey. Methods: We implemented the routine collection of PROs as part of clinical care in December, 2015. Patients were offered tablets in clinic, and were asked to complete the surveys at most of their visits. We used computer-adapted technology to decrease the length of time needed to survey. We collected the following PROMIS instruments: Depression, Pain Interference, Physical Function, and Satisfaction with Social Roles. We also collected the GERD-HRQL, a General Health question, and a Current Health Visual Analog Scale (VAS). We retrospectively reviewed our results from December 2015 through September 2017. Results: Our response rate was 70% over the last year of collection. In total, 2166 assessments were completed by 1026 patients. The mean scores in our total patient population were as follows: VAS 59, GERD-HRQL 8, General health 51, Depression 52, Pain 56, Physical Function 43, and Social Roles 46. For PROMIS instruments, the mean for the national population is 50, with 10 as the standard deviation. For the depression and pain scores a higher score is worse, while a higher score indicates better quality of life for social roles and physical function.",

Results: In total, 123 RYGB and 88 SG were included in our analysis. No significant differences were found between cefazolin and clindamycin regarding hypertension resolution rates after SG. There was a significant difference in the resolution of hypertension after RYGB with the use of prophylactic clindamycin or cefazolin. As shown in Figure 1 , patients who underwent RYGB and received clindamycin had a significantly higher rate of hypertension resolution compared to cefazolin. This effect started at 2 weeks post-operatively (52.4% vs 23.5% respectively, p=0.008) and persisted up to the 1-year (57.9% vs 33.3% respectively, p=0.05). We found no significant differences in patient age, sex, number of pre-operative hypertensive medications, pre-operative BMI, or %BMI change after 1 year to account for the significant effect of antibiotic choice on hypertension resolution. Conclusion: This study represents the first clinical report to suggest an impact of the type of antibiotic administered at the time of RYGB on co-morbidity resolution, specifically hypertension. Future studies will be needed to confirm that the mechanism of action for this novel finding is due to the differing modifications of the gastrointestinal microflora population based on the specific peri-operative antibiotic administered. Introduction: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band with plication (LAGBP) is a novel bariatric procedure which combines the adjustability of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) with the restrictive nature of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). The addition of plication of the stomach to LAGB should provide better appetite control, more effective weight loss, and greater weight loss potential.",

Introduction: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a common and effective form of bariatric weight loss surgery. However, a subset of patients will fail to achieve the expected total body weight loss (TBWL) greater than 20% after 12 months or experience significant weight regain despite dietary, psychiatric, and behavioral counseling. Although alternative procedural interventions exist for operative revision after suboptimal RYGB weight loss, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) provides an option with short operative time, low morbidity, and effective results. We have previously demonstrated that short-term (12-month), and mid-term (24-month) weight loss is achievable with LAGB for failed RYGB. The objective of this study is to report the long term 5 year outcomes of LAGB after RYGB failure. Methods and Procedures: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data before and after RYGB when available, and before and after revision with LAGB was performed. Background: Saline filled intragastic balloons have become a common outpatient procedure for the treatment of obesity. Acute dilation, ischemia and necrosis of the stomach has been described in the medical literature. Gastric necrosis from acute gastric dilation is a rare but life-threatening condition, which requires timely diagnosis and management. We present a case of partial gastric ischemia with necrosis 72 hours following placement of a saline filled intragastric balloon. Postoperative complaints of bloating, nausea and vomiting are common complaints following placement of saline filled intragastric balloons and can lead to a delay in diagnosis. Early diagnosis and management is essential in avoiding this life threatening complication. Case Report: A 59 year old woman, BMI 33, comorbid conditions of diabetes mellitus underwent uncomplicated placement of a saline filled intragastric balloon for treatment of obesity. 24 hours after placement the patient complained of cramping and bloating. 48 hours following placement the patient developed vomiting and presented to an emergency room for evaluation. She was found to have blood glucose exceeding 400 and a severely dilated stomach with pneumotosis on CT evaluation. NG tube decompression and ICU management of the severe hyperglycemia was initiated. Removal of the intragastric balloon was delayed 12-14 hours until an appropriate endoscopic retrieval kit could be obtained. Endoscopic retrieval was performed without incident and near complete necrosis of the gastric mucosa was noted. The antrum was the only area spared. 48 hours after retrieval a laparoscopic evaluation of the stomach revealed full thickness necross of the entire fundus and greater curve. Indocyanine Green (ICG) Fluorescent Dye was used to assess vascular integrity of the remaining stomach and to define lines of resection. Resection of the greater curvature was performed using ICG florescent dye to ensure that the angle of Hiss was viable and well perfused. The patient had a full recovery and subtotal gastrectomy was avoided.",

Bariatric surgery remains the best treatment for morbid obesity. The recent use of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a single stage procedure has met with great success because of its quick learning curve and minimal postoperative complication rates. However, there are concerns if the LSG is an effective procedure for long-term weight loss. Although criticized at first, the mini-gastric bypass (MGB) surgery has become a great option for morbidly obese patients because of the ability to lose weight with minimal post-op complications. The aim of this review is to assess the outcomes of LSG as it compares to MGB for the management of morbid obesity. Introduction: We hypothesize that a jejunoileal anastomosis and partial diversion using Magnamosis, a novel magnetic compression device, is technically feasible and will improve insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome similarly to patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Metabolic surgery has demonstrated improvements in various parameters including insulin resistance, triglyceride levels, and cholesterol. It may be technically feasible to perform a less-invasive operation through partial diversion, and thereby stimulate an increase in incretins from the L-cells of the ileum to glean these benefits. Methods and Procedures: We performed a laparotomy and jejunoileal partial diversion using Magnamosis in five Rhesus macaques with induced insulin resistance through dietary modifications. After surgery, weight was monitored and a metabolic laboratory evaluation was performed weekly. Timed tests were performed at baseline and again at 3 and 6 weeks postoperatively for triglyceride levels, GLP-1, insulin, glucose, and bile acids. The primates were followed for 8 weeks prior to euthanasia. Results are represented as mean\u00b1SEM and all p-values were calculated using a two-sample Students' t-test. Introduction: Many studies concerning individuals seeking bariatric surgery indicate a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorder in this population, both before and after surgery, however results are not conclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in psychiatric health after gastric bypass surgery. Methods: Patients within the catchment area of the department of psychiatry of the South Alvsborg Hospital, operated with gastric bypass surgery during 2011-2012 were identified through the Scandinavian quality registry (SOReg). Patients files were examined and psychiatric diagnoses and alcohol/drug abuse were recorded preoperatively and with a follow up time of 5 years.",

Four patients with a preoperative history of alcohol abuse were identified, all women. These individuals did not seem to abuse alcohol/drugs postoperatively. Postoperatively 9 patients with an alcohol/drug abuse were identified, 3 men, 6 women. None of them had a former history of abuse. 4 of the patient performing suicidal attempts postoperatively, 3 men 1 woman, had a postoperatively emerging alcohol/drug abuse. Conclusion: Preoperatively known alcohol/drug abuse or suicidal attempts do not seem to predispose for postoperative abusive problems or suicidal behavior. Preoperative identification of individuals prone to alcohol/drug abuse or suicidal attempts seems difficult. Introduction: In the past, our group has popularized models for gastric bypass, sleeve and gastric imbrication. There are currently no models to predict weight loss following Single Anastomosis Duodenal Switch. Surgeons who offer this procedure are left to guess based on their limited experience how their patients will do following surgery We have developed a simple office based algorithm to predict weight loss following this procedure. Method: 161 patients met the criteria for this study. These patients underwent surgery at a single institution from June 2013 to December 2016. Non-linear Regression analysis was performed to interpolate weight loss at one year. A multilinear regression was run to determine the significant variables. A model was then constructed to predict weight loss after Single Anastomosis Duodenal Switch.",

The different comorbidities of these bariatric patients helped to stratify patients into these 2 main cluster groups. Better predictability on length of operative procedure can lead to more efficient use of OR time and staff, thus ultimately leading to savings for the hospital. In addition, we used automated noninvasive tracking methods to identify phases of bariatric procedures that will allow more accurate estimated OR time to efficiently schedule cases. The Smart OR, which is equipped with multiple noninvasive sensors, allows for error free tracking and monitoring without human interference. Objectives: Successful outcomes after bariatric surgery (BS) require a comprehensive educational program (CEP) focused on post-surgical dietary and lifestyle changes. At our institution, patients must comply with a 4-week Life-After-Surgery program prior to surgery. Since many patients are not able to participate in-person, an online CEP was created to improve accessibility. To evaluate comprehension, a 16-question test is administered at the last preoperative visit to participants of both classes. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of online versus inperson CEP in terms of comprehension and post-operative weight loss. Methods: Patients who underwent BS from August 2016-May 2017 were retrospectively reviewed at a single institution. All patients who underwent the in-person or online CEP, completed the 16-question test, and had post-operative follow-up for at least 6 months were included. Baseline demographic, operative, and weight data were obtained using the electronic medical record. Background: Body weight loss after bariatric surgery is affected by several factors. Diabetes status or preoperative body mass index (BMI) would affect the body weight loss after surgery. Age and sexuality may also be the predictor. Furthermore, the malabsorptive procedure is considered more effective for body weight loss than the restrictive procedure alone. We investigated the contribution of preoperative background data and procedures to the body weight loss after surgery.",

The primary indication for revisional surgery included management of postoperative adverse events (n=32, 61.5%) and weight recidivism (n=20, 38.5%). In patients with postoperative complications, the most common indications for revisional surgery were dysphagia (n=8, 15.4%), marginal ulcer (n= 7, 13.5%), gastric outlet obstruction (n=7, 13.5%), and fistula formation (n=5, 9.6%). The most common type of revisions included conversion of vertical banded gastroplasty to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n=18), revision of RYGB (n=13), conversion of adjustable gastric banding to sleeve gastrectomy (SG, n=6), and SG to RYGB (n=4). Two out of seven (28.6%) patients with 30-day postoperative readmissions had serious complications that required reoperation. One of them underwent small bowel resection for ischemia and the other had thoracotomy for hemothorax evacuation developing secondary to a gastropleural fistula.

She tolerated the procedure without complication and was discharged home on the following day. On postoperative day 9, she presented to the emergency department with fever and epigastric pain. Contrast CT revealed an isolated filling defect within the proximal left portal vein; abdominal Doppler demonstrated an acute thrombus occluding the left portal vein with normal flow in the main and right portal veins. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of therapeutic anticoagulation with lovenox. A complete hematologic workup did not uncover any hypercoagulable conditions. The patient recovered well and remained asymptomatic at her follow-up visit 12 weeks after operation. Discussion: PMVT is a rare surgical complication with multifactorial etiology. In bariatric surgery, evidence suggests LSG elicits more frequent PMVT compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A 2017 systematic review cited the incidence rate of PMVT as 0.3-1% after LSG. The mechanisms are thought to be due to pneumoperitoneum, procoagulant obese state, manipulation of portomesenteric venous system during division of the gastrocolic ligament, and postoperative dehydration. Liver retraction is paramount during laparoscopic bariatric surgery to provide adequate visualization of the upper stomach and diaphragmatic hiatus. Most methods of liver retraction produce significant pressure on the liver parenchyma by compressing it against the diaphragm. Three types of liver injury have been documented in literature: minor congestion, traumatic parenchymal rupture, and delayed liver necrosis. Uniquely, we propose an additional type of injury-left portal vein thrombosis due to compression of left liver lobe with the Nathanson retractor. Conclusion: The case described herein represents the first documented report of isolated left portal vein thrombosis after LSG. This is a unique presentation of retraction-related liver injury causing PMVT by mechanical compression of liver parenchyma. As surgical procedures increase in duration, intermittent release of liver retraction should be performed at regular intervals. Introduction: Up to 11% of patients experience internal hernia (IH) after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Studies have shown that antecolic Roux limb orientation, and closure of the mesenteric defect reduce, but do not eliminate, the incidence of IH. We hypothesize that despite operative differences, IH occur more frequently in patients who experience significant weight loss. This study aims to determine whether those patients who present with IH following RYGB experience greater than 70% excess body weight loss (EBWL). Methods: A retrospective chart of all patients who underwent IH repair following RYGB at our institution between Sept 2014 and Sept 2017 was performed. All applicable CPT codes to encompass IH repair were reviewed (n=412). 17 patients with IH repair after RYGB were identified. Results: Of the 17 patients, 16 were female. The mean pre-RYGB weight was 279lbs (sd\u00b154.5), BMI 37.8 kg/m 2 (sd\u00b18.7). All procedures but one were performed in an antecolic configuration; the other retrocolic-antegastric. Fifteen cases were laparoscopic and two were open; nine had the jejunal mesenteric defect closed, eight did not. The average weight loss from the time of RYGBP to IH presentation was 91.82lbs (sd\u00b138.18) and %EBWL from RYGB to the nadir weight was 77% (sd\u00b124). When evaluated by t-test, there was no statistical difference in BMI at the time of program initiation, RYGB, or IH presentation, as well as number of pounds lost, %EBWL, or time to IH presentation, when comparing patients for whom the mesenteric defect was closed or not. Average time from RYGB to IH presentation was 4.5 years (range 190-4655 days) . Conclusion: In our limited cohort of patients who have presented with internal hernia after RYGB, there was an average of 77% EBWL. This is greater than the average expected %EBWL at our institution and others, suggesting that IH may occur in patients with greater weight loss at a higher frequency. Mesenteric defect closure did not appear to have any influence in this limited cohort, suggesting that weight loss is a stronger factor in IH development. We plan a more extensive evaluation in a larger cohort of patients to determine if greater %EBWL is a predictor of IH formation in patients undergoing RYGB.",

This study aims to assess feasibility and outcomes of postoperative day (POD) 1 discharge after LRYGB and LSG from a national database. Methods: Patients who underwent elective primary LRYGB and LSG and were discharged on POD 1 and 2 were extracted from Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) 2015 dataset. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed between cases with POD1 vs POD2 discharge, and the 30-day outcomes of the propensity-matched cohorts were compared. High risk patients were excluded from the analysis. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate a large volume, multi surgeon bariatric surgery center producing the largest sample size to date proving efficacy (% weight loss) and safety of sleeve gastrectomy following band removal in one or two step procedures. Methods: All patients undergoing conversion of LAGB to LRYGB (33) and LSG (291) regardless of one step vs two step conversion from January 2006 to January 2017 were included.

Introduction: The purpose of the study was to describe the use of intraoperative Indocyanine Green (ICG) fluorescence angiography to identify the blood supply patterns of the stomach and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). We hypothesized that identifying these vascular patterns may help modifying the surgical technique to prevent ischemia-related postoperative leaks. Methods: 86 patients underwent laparoscopic SG and were examined intraoperatively with ICG fluorescence angiography at an academic center from January 2016 to September 2017. Prior to the construction of the SG, 1mL of ICG was injected intravenously and Pinpoint\u00ae technology was used to identify the blood supply of the stomach. Afterwards, the SG was created with attention to preserving the identified blood supply to the GEJ and gastric tube. Finally, 3mL of ICG were injected and Pinpoint\u00ae technology was used again to ensure that all the pertinent blood vessels were preserved. Results: 86 patients successfully underwent the procedure with no complications. The following blood supply patterns to the GEJ were found:",

            "text": "The incidence of overall accessory blood supply to the right-side dominant pattern was more common than expected. In about half of the cases where an accessory vessel was found in the gastrohepatic ligament, the blood flow was toward the stomach (and not the liver). Furthermore, the incidence of accessory blood supply from the left side was found in 34% of the cases. 10% of patients had both the left side accessory and accessory gastric artery pattern. In these particular patients, if a concurrent hiatal hernia repair is performed, these accessory blood supplies are at risk of being injured if care is not taken to preserve them, rendering the GEJ relatively ischemic. Conclusion: ICG fluorescence angiography allows determining the major blood supply to the proximal stomach prior to any dissection during sleeve gastrectomy so that an effort can be made to avoid unnecessary injury to these vessels. Background: Morbid obesity, a common medical concern with significant health risks, has a prevalence of 10.4% among U.S. adults. Bariatric surgery provides effective weight loss for morbidly obese patients with improvement in their comorbid conditions. Traditionally, routine intraoperative drain placement (IDP) and postoperative esophagram (UGIS) were thought to identify early postoperative complications. Recently, these interventions have been scrutinized for their effectiveness. We hypothesized that IDP and postoperative UGIS do not alter outcomes in bariatric surgery and only increase hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Two cohorts, each consisting of 100 patients from either 2015 or 2017 were analyzed from our institution. In the 2015 cohort, all patients had IDP and an UGIS on postoperative day 1, prior to starting a clear liquid diet. In the 2017 cohort, no patients had IDP or UGIS, but instead were started on a clear liquid diet on postoperative day 1, in the absence of vomiting. All patients in each cohort underwent either a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A retrospective study was performed to analyze whether there was a significant difference in postoperative complications, length of stay, and operating room time between these two cohorts. Those who underwent T2DM remission were less likely to be VDD at all time points. The rates of VDD appear to be slightly higher in RYGB at each time points. The rates of macrocytic anemia, microcytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia were low and varied depending on surgical procedure, with no relevant increase following surgery (see figure 1 ).",

Cardiovascular risk reduction is a well studied and described result of bariatric surgery. The objective of this study is to quantify hypertension resolution in patients who underwent bariatric surgery at our institution. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all the patients who underwent either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) at our institution between 2010 and 2015. We selected those patients who were on antihypertensive medical treatment and had a 12-month follow-up. Hypertension resolution was defined as the interruption of any blood pressure medications within the follow-up period. We compared the patients who had resolution of hypertension (group 1) with patients who did not (group 2), based on demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. Chi-square and student T-test were used for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Results: Out of 1330 patients, 185 (13.9%) patients met the inclusion criteria, out of which, 73 (39.5%) had a complete resolution of hypertension within 12 months. The patient population included in Group 1 was predominantly female n=114 patients (61.8%), diabetic (n=87, 47%), with a mean BMI of 30.31\u00b14.45 kg/m 2 , a mean age of 52.6\u00b110.7 years, and a preoperative systolic blood pressure mean of 131\u00b114.31 mmHg. The most common procedure performed was LSG with n=105 (57%). Comparison between group 1 and group 2 based on age, gender, BMI, and diabetes showed no statistically significant difference. Estimated BMI loss % at 12 months, type of procedure and % EBMIL showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. Conclusions: Rapid weight loss is associated with a drastic reduction of blood pressure. Besides weight loss, we did not identify a clear correlation between risk factors when we compared patients who had resolution of hypertension with patients without resolution. Further prospective studies should be done for better understand these findings. The Mount Sinai Hospital, 2 University of Chicago Introduction: For many patients, HIV has transformed from a life-threatening illness into a manageable chronic disease. Reflecting trends in the general population, obesity is increasingly prevalent among HIV-positive patients. Surgical intervention has shown the greatest effectiveness in treating obesity. It is unknown, however, whether physician attitudes reflect the changing trends in obesity care for HIV-positive patients. Methods and Procedures: Medical students from the first, second, and fourth years of training were invited to participate in an IRB-approved survey, handed out during didactic sessions, which was designed to assess their knowledge and attitudes regarding bariatric surgery in HIV-positive patients. Self-reported demographic information of respondents was also collected. The outcome of interest was the proportion of correct responses. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. Results: Surveys were completed by 127 medical students. Demographic covariates included the following: age, sex, race, BMI, and year of training. Age, sex, race, and BMI were not statistically significant in the multivariate model. However, in both univariate and multivariate models, each additional year of training was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of correct responses (multivariate model beta coefficient=0.440, p\\0.001).",

Case Report: In summary, a 55 year-old female with a preoperative BMI of 40kg/m2 had an uncomplicated LRYGB one year prior to her presentation. She was a non-smoker, was abstinent of alcohol and did not use NSAIDs, steroids or other ulcerogenic medications. Eight months post procedure with a BMI of 29.1 kg/m 2 she was diagnosed and treated with BCS plus SLNB for a pT2N0M0 ER/PR +ve HER2 \u2212ve breast cancer. One week following her third cycle of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide, she presented with two days of melena, small volume hematemesis and abdominal discomfort. The patient was resuscitated with PRBC, started on a PPI infusion and had free air ruled out on a CXR. Upper endoscopy was complete showing a giant MU at the gastrojejunal anastomosis, biopsies ruled out malignancy and H. pylori. Subsequent CT abdomen/pelvis identified contrast extravasation from the anastomosis confirming a free perforation. Broad spectrum antibiotics were started and a diagnostic laparoscopy complete. A graham patch repair utilizing omentum and abdominal washout were complete with placement of surgical drains. The patient was supported with parenteral nutrition while NPO. Diet was advanced after an upper GI series on post operative day 7 showed no ongoing leak. The patient was discharged on post operative day 13, recovered and although further chemotherapy was discontinued she completed whole breast radiotherapy. Conclusion: Leaks and hemorrhage are early postoperative complications that are not seen intraoperatively in our experience. Furthermore, endoscopy significantly increases mean operative time. Routine use should be left to the discretion of the surgeon but should not be considered an essential step of the sleeve gastrectomy.",

Two preoperative antimicrobial protocols were compared. Patients undergoing surgery prior to February 2016 received 2 g of cefazolin whereas patients undergoing surgery after February 1, 2016 received a new antimicrobial protocol consisting of 2 g cefazolin, 500 mg metronidazole and 30 ml oralchlorhexidine rinse. The primary outcome was 30 day SSI including superficial SSI, deep incisional SSI and organ/space infection as defined by the Centre for Disease Control. Clinic charts and provincial electronic medical records were reviewed for emergency department visits, microbiology investigations and physician dictations diagnosing SSI. Outcomes were assessed using a students t-test. Results: Two hundred seventy six patients underwent LRYGB of which 167 received the refined antimicrobial protocol and 109 received cefazolin. The refined antimicrobial protocol significantly decreased the rate of deep incisional SSI compared to cefazolin (n=1, 0.6% vs n=5, 4.6%; p\\ 0.05). The refined antimicrobial protocol resulted in an insignificant overall reduction in the rate of superficial SSI (n=12, 7.2% vs n=13, 11.9%; p[0.05) and organ/space infection (n=0, 0.0% vs n= 2, 1.8%; p[0.05) respectively. Conclusions: A preoperative antimicrobial protocol using cefazolin, metronidazole and chlorhexidine oral rinse appears to reduce the rate of SSI following LRYGB. This protocol may be most effective to prevent deep incisional SSI. Additional patient cases or alternative study design including a randomized control trial is required to better understand the efficacy of this protocol. Background: For many years, the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) was considered a good balance of complications and weight loss. According to a several short-term studies single anastomosis duodenal switch or stomach intestinal pylorus sparing surgery (SIPS) offers similar to weight loss to RYGB with fewer complications and better diabetes resolution. However, no one has substantiated complication and nutritional differences between these two procedures over the midterm. This paper seeks to substantiate previous studies and compare complication and nutritional outcomes between RYGB and SIPS.",

It also shows that the public insurance group is possibly at higher risk for complications and readmissions postoperatively due to the lack of social support at home given that a much higher percentage of them are single or divorced, and lack employment. It is likely that this lack of support at home prompts more frequent readmissions and associated complications. Introduction: Gastric bypass has been an acceptable treatment for the morbidly obese patient, with proven efficacy on weight loss and remission of co morbidities, especially diabetes (T2DM). Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining momentum as an alternative procedure for the morbidly obese patient. The aim of this study is to assess the resolution of T2DM by examining HbA1c, BMI, fat %, and % excess weight loss in T2DM patients in our LSG patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 33 T2DM patients before and after LSG, analyzing HgA1c, BMI, % weight loss, fat %, and diabetic medications. Data was analyzed by using SPSS version 24. Paired T-test was applied to see the significance of BMI, weight, fat % and HbA1c before and after the procedure. Introduction: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a known risk following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), with up to 50% of patients affected by the disease postoperatively. Of these patients, an unknown number progress to medically refractory GERD. Due to their postsurgical anatomy, these patients have limited options for intervention. While endoluminal therapies are available, surgical revision to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has become an accepted revisional treatment. Despite this therapeutic option, many payors deny coverage for this treatment.",

All of these patients underwent revision due GERD refractory to maximal medical therapy. The average body mass index was 37 kg/m 2 , and our average operative time was 184 minutes. One patient required laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 30 days due to acute cholecystitis, and another patient required reoperation for control of staple line bleeding. There were otherwise no 30-day morbidities or readmissions. Fifty nine percent stopped all antacid medication by six months, and 65% stopped by 24 months. Of the 35% percent of patient still on proton pump inhibitor therapy, none of those patients complained of reflux symptoms. Of non-Medicare patients, 69% were initially denied insurance coverage for revision. Only one plan accounted for all initial approvals. Twenty five percent of denied patients eventually paid out of pocket, and the remaining 75% ultimately secured coverage after an appeal process. with no significant differences in mortality or hospital stay. Significantly shorter operative times were observed in the adolescent group (83.6\u00b146 vs 88.1\u00b151, p\\0.001). In Univariate analysis blood transfusions and VTE rates were significantly lower in the adolescent group but there was no difference after risk-adjusted logistic regression analysis. Analysis of readmission data showed lower rates in adolescents compared to young adults (3.67% vs 4.44% p=0.06). However, adolescents are more frequently readmitted secondary to gallstone disease (6.3% vs 1.9%, p\\0.05). The most common reason for readmissions in both groups was nausea and vomiting with fluid/electrolyte depletion, followed by abdominal pain. Conclusion: Adolescent bariatric surgery is feasible and safe, with outcomes similar to that of young adults. LSG is currently the most common bariatric procedure performed in adolescents which is reasonable given the relative lack of co-morbid conditions within this group. Nausea and vomiting are the most common reason of readmission in both groups, but gallstone disease is significantly higher in adolescents, suggesting that this population should be carefully screened for gallbladder disease preoperatively. Further studies regarding long-term results are needed to elucidate long-term outcomes, such as the durability of comorbidity resolutions in adolescent patients. ",

Introduction: Patients with \"super-super obesity\", defined as a BMI\u226560, are at higher risk of weight-related health problems and might benefit more than others from metabolic and bariatric surgery. However, these benefits need to be weighed against the potential for increased operative and perioperative risks. Accurate data regarding these patients is critical to guide procedure choice and informed, shared decision-making. The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSA-QIP) is a national accreditation and quality improvement program, which captures clinically-rich specialty-specific data for the majority of all bariatric operations in the United States. This is the first analysis of the MBSAQIP Participant Use File (PUF) focusing on this at-risk subpopulation. Introduction: Sleeve gastrectomy represents one of the most common surgical procedure used in bariatric surgery. The most feared complication following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is the leak that occurs at the staple line. One method to reduce the risk of leak is the use of reinforcement material at the suture line. In this study, the efficacy of sutures and fibrin glue in the prevention of staple leak has been compared retrospectively. Materials and Methods: A total of 250 patients undergoing LSG between October 2011 and August 2015 at the Medical Faculty of Firat University were retrospectively assessed using the hospital database system records.",

            "text": "Results: There were 77 males (31%) and 173 (69%) females, with a mean age of 34 years (range: 16-65 y), and body mass index of 45 kg/m 2 . While no reinforcement material was used in 61 patients (24%) at the suture line, reinforcement sutures or fibrin glue were used in 54 (22%) and 135 (54%) patients, respectively. Postoperative leak occurred in 8 patients (3.2%), and 6 (9.8%) of these had no use of reinforcment material for leak prevention, while additional sutures or fibrin glue had been used in 2 patients, one in each group (0.7%). One patient died due to leak and the consequent development of sepsis (0.4%). Discussion: LSG is increasingly more frequently used in bariatric surgery practice. However, an increase also occurs in the rate of complications. A discrepancy exists in the published literature regarding the benefit of reinforcment the suture line on the risk of leak risk. In our patient series, patients without the use of additional material in the staple line had a significantly increased risk of leak. Conclusion: Despite some controversy, strong evidence exists on the effectiveness of fibrin glue in the prevention of leaks in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Background: Laparoscopic bariatric surgery has been performed safely since 1991. In a persistent search for fewer and smaller scars, single port and acuscopic surgery or even NOTES have been implemented. The goal of this study is to analyze the safety and feasibility of using a low cost incisionless liver retraction compared to a standard laparoscopic retractor for sleeve gastrectomy. Methods and Procedures: Candidates for sleeve gastrectomy that fulfilled 1991 NIH criteria for bariatric surgery were selected. Those younger than 18 and/or with prior upper-left quadrant surgery were excluded. All patients signed written consent. Patients were randomized 1:1 to either a standard 5 port technique with a fan-type liver retractor through a 5 mm port (group A); or a 4 port technique with the liver retracted by a polypropylene 1 suture passed through the right crura and retrieved at the epigastrium with the use of a fascia closure needle (group B). All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon. Surgery length from insertion of first port to withdrawal of the last was the primary endpoint. Anthropometric data, % of pre-surgical total weight loss (%PTWL), visualization of the surgical field, complications inherent to liver retraction and postoperative morbidity were recorded. Background: Comprehensive web and hospital based preparative patient education allow the morbidly obese patients to understand weight loss surgery, its benefits, the necessity of follow up and the risk of weight regain. While the inhouse seminars provide a face-to-face interaction with the bariatric program staff, the online seminars are easily accessible and more cost effective. The primary objective of this study is to compare demographics and weight loss surgery outcomes between patients who participated in the online vs in-house preparative seminars. Methods: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective chart review was performed involving patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 2015 and December 2016 at a tertiary care center. The patients were divided into two groups based on their choice of educational seminar, online or in-house, prior to their initial consult with a surgeon. Data was collected on age, type of insurance, length of stay (LOS), longest follow up and change in BMI to assess weight loss. Results: One hundred and eighteen patients were included in this study. Eighty patients attended in-house seminar while 38 completed online seminar. The various types of surgery (laparoscopic gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and band) were similarly represented between the two groups. There was no difference in the type of insurance policy between the groups. Patients who elected to take the in-house seminar were on average 5 years older than those who chose the online course, which was statistically significant (p\\0.05). There were no differences in LOS, longest follow up after surgery, and weight loss at 12 months between the groups. Conclusions: Based on MBSAQIP registry data, patients age 65 or over did not have higher odds of a 30-day readmission compared to younger patients after LSG or LRYGB. Rates of 30-day readmission, reoperation, and death were similar, but rates of complications (e.g. pneumonias, unplanned intubations) were higher in the older group.",

We identified 4 groups of patients according to their primary procedures: Adjustable gastric band (AGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP), Vertical band Gastroplasty (VBG), and Sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Of the 119 patients, 51 (43%) had ABG as primary procedure. Of those, 55% had their band removed due to food intolerance and severe dysphagia and 37% had a conversion to either RYGBP or Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) due to weight recidivism. In the RYGPBP group (n=38), 53% of the patients presented with late complications. Of these, 45% had an acute presentation (small bowel obstruction, internal hernia, or perforated marginal ulcer) requiring emergency surgery. Only 8% patients needed gastric bypass takedown due to severe hypoglycemia. Weight recidivism was noted in 47% of the patients that necessitated either revising the anastomosis, trimming of the gastric pouch or gastrogastric fistula takedown. In the VBG group (n=14), 79% of the patients experienced weight recidivism that required conversion to RYGB and 21% of the patients required the VBG to be taken down due to obstructive symptoms. In the SG group (n=14), 21% of the patients experienced early complications needing a second procedure. Weight recidivism was found as the most common reason for conversion (50%) to RYGBP. Twenty nine percent of the patients in this group underwent conversion to a RYGBP due to severe de novo GERD. Introduction: Our aim was to systematically review the literature to compare weight loss outcomes and safety of secondary surgery after sleeve gastrectomy (SG), particularly between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS). SG was originally developed as the first part of a two-stage procedure for BPD-DS. However, it is now the most common standalone bariatric surgery performed in the United States. The majority of SG are done as the sole bariatric operation but in 3%, a second operation is necessary, due to insufficient weight loss, weight regain or reflux. The most common second-stage operations are RYGB at 46% and BPD-DS at 24%. There are a few small case series comparing RYGB to BPD-DS as a secondary surgery after SG. These studies suggest that after failed SG, BPD-DS results in greater weight loss but higher early complication rates than RYGB. We had one mortality, related in part to supra-therapeutic anticoagulation perioperatively. One patient underwent successful heart transplantation and 2 additional patients were reactivated on the transplant list. Conclusion: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is effective in advanced heart failure patients for meaningful weight loss, reactivation to the transplant wait list, and ultimately cardiac transplantation. However, this complex population carries a high perioperative risk and close multidisciplinary collaboration is required. More data is needed to best optimize perioperative management of these patients.",

            "text": "The Introduction: Bariatric surgery is a highly effective treatment for severe obesity. While its effect on improvement of the metabolic syndrome is well described, its effect on intrinsic bone fragility and fracture propagation is unclear. Therefore, the aims of this systematic review of the literature were to examine (1) the incidence of fracture following bariatric surgery, (2) the association of fracture with the specific bariatric surgical procedure (3) Conclusion: It appears that the overall risk of sustaining a fracture of any type after undergoing bariatric surgery is approximately 5 percent after an average follow up of 3.6 years. The greatest risk of fractures is associated with the BPD, with the RYGB being the most favorable. Fractures following bariatric surgeries tend to follow osteoporotic and fragility patterns. Post-operative supplementation of vitamin D, calcium and weight bearing exercises need to be optimized, and long term follow-up studies will be needed to confirm that these interventions will indeed reduce fracture risk following bariatric surgery. Background: The effect of sleeve gastrectomy on gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) remains controversial. It is currently common practice to perform a hiatal hernia repair (HHR) at the time of the sleeve gastrectomy, however, there are few data on the outcomes of GERD symptoms in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of performing an esophagopexy hiatal hernia repair on GERD symptoms in morbidly obese patients undergoing robotic sleeve gastrectomy (RSG).",

Results: Thirty-seven patients were identified meeting the inclusion criteria (RSG+HHR+esophagopexy) with a mean follow-up of 28. Over the past 4 years there have been several bariatric surgeries cancelled secondarily to abnormal pre-operative test results within Eastern Health. These surgeries are often cancelled the day before their scheduled surgery, which does not provide sufficient time to book other patients. The end result is that the OR gets underutilized and the bariatric surgery waitlist grows. Prior to any major surgery patients are often subjected to a routine screening process, which includes a history and physical along with diagnostic screening tests and screening blood work. A preliminary analysis was done of the first 50 patients through the bariatric surgery program at Eastern Health assessing the coagulation study results and outcomes. Analysis showed that out of the first 50 patients 2% were found to have a history of bleeding, 10% were using anticoagulants preoperatively, another 2% were noted to have a family history of bleeding. In the preoperative blood work that was done, 30% were found to have an elevated PTT/ INR for which hematology ended up being consulted in 4% of the patients. Overall this did not change the preoperative management of these patients and they went on to have their surgery. Intraoperatively 1 patient was noted to have excessive bleeding and this was found not be associated with any preoperative elevation in their coagulation studies or family history of bleeding disorders. Post operatively there was bleeding in 1 patient which required transfusion, however this too was found not to be associated with any preoperative elevation in their coagulation studies or family history of bleeding disorders.",

Patients underwent either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Using medical record data, patients were preoperatively categorized as follows: not depressed, history of depression but not currently on anti-depressive medication, and history of depression and presently taking anti-depressive medication. Patient demographic characteristics were obtained preoperatively. Clinical and biochemical risk factors for cardiovascular disease were evaluated preoperatively and 6 and 12 months following bariatric surgery.

Introduction: The use of closed suction drains is associated with poor outcomes in many anastomotic operations and routine use is not recommended. In this context, intraoperative drain placement for primary bariatric surgery remains controversial. Recent studies demonstrate that drains confer no benefit to patients; however, data are limited to descriptive single center experiences with low sample size. In order to characterize this practice gap, and implement evidence based recommendations, we sought to evaluate the use of closed suction drain and outcomes following primary bariatric cases using the MBSAQIP registry. Methods: We used data from the 2015 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) public use file for patients who underwent a non-revisional laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). We excluded patients with ASA status greater than 3 or conversion to an open procedure. We analyzed demographics, preoperative comorbidities, procedure type for patients who did and did not undergo drain placement. Adjusted rates of postoperative complications and mortality were then compared based on receipt of postoperative drain placement. Results: Of the 141,404 included patients who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery, 33,618 (23.8%) underwent intraoperative drain placement. Drains were more often placed in patients who underwent LRYGB, were older, had higher preoperative BMI, had higher preoperative ASA status, and had more comorbid conditions. After patient level risk adjustment, there was no difference in rates of leaks requiring intervention (0.32% versus 0.26%, p=0.065) or mortality (6.5% versus 5.4%, p=0.206) for patients with and without drains. In patients who underwent drain placement, there were higher rates of transfusion (9.2% versus 5.6%, p\\0.001), reoperations for bleeding (0.30% versus 0.18%, p=0.001), all reoperations (4.8% versus 3.9%, p\\0.001), and surgical site infections (SSI) (1.0% versus 0.6%, p\\0.001).",

            "text": "Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that nearly one quarter of all laparoscopic bariatric surgery patients undergo drain placement. We found that drain placement is more common in preoperatively higher risk patients and following higher complexity procedures as suggested by associated increased rates of transfusion and reoperations for bleeding. We found no benefit to drain placement in terms of interventions for clinically significant leaks or mortality. Finally, patients who underwent drain placement were more likely to develop SSI suggesting routine placement is not without risk. Although further prospective studies are warranted, our analysis demonstrates that drains have the potential for harm with minimal protective benefit for patients after primary bariatric surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy (50% n=24) and Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (50% n=24) were the two types of surgeries done in our population. The risk of developing atrial fibrillation was calculated preoperatively and found a 7-fold higher risk in females and 4-fold greater risk in males when compared with the ideal risk for each category. At 12 months follow-up the preoperative risk was 11.14\u00b115.45% with an absolute risk reduction of 2.03% corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 18.22% with males having a more significant change at 12 months follow-up. These findings and the electrocardiographic changes at 12 months follow-up are better described in Background: The Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) is the most popular procedure worldwide to treat obesity. Among those that are obese, GERD has a prevalence of 39.8 percent. Many surgeons do not perform LSG in these patients because only 34.6 percent of symptomatic patients showed resolution of GERD-like symptoms after concomitant sleeve gastrectomy with hiatal hernia repair. Many surgeons perform the gastric bypass on GERD patients with hiatal hernias because they believe its superior for the resolution of GERD. When they do this they overlook the many long term complication associated with gastric bypass. Also, many patients do not want the gastric bypass under any circumstances. Surgeons need to be open to finding better way to reduce the high recurrent rates of GERD after LSG. Materials and Methods: This is a single institution, multi-surgeon, retrospective study involving 73 morbidly obese patients in a prospectively kept data base from January of 2015 through July of 2017. These patients all had GERD with preoperatively identified hiatal hernias on EGD. All patients were dependent on anti-reflux medications. There were 9 (12.4%) males and 64 (87.6%) females. BMI ranged from 35 to 63. Hiatal hernias measured from 2 cm to 8 cm. All LSG patients received a primary crural closure, with or without Gore Bio A mesh placement, at least 6 weeks prior to the sleeve gastrectomy. Post-operatively, patients were interviewed for GERD symptomatology and anti-reflux medication dependency. Results: Of the 73 patients, 53 (72.60%) patients had resolution of GERD-like symptoms and off all anti-reflux medications after the staged hiatal hernia repair and sleeve gastrectomy. 13 patients (17.80%) had improvement of GERD but still dependent on anti-reflux medication. 7 patients (9.60%) had no resolution or improvement of GERD. There was one post-operative complication of laryngospasm with pulmonary edema status post extubation. There were no mortalities in the series.",

This rate is comparable to GERD resolution after gastric bypass. This may be an alternative approach to hiatal hernias in the morbidly obese patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease who do not want a gastric bypass. Background: Bariatric surgery is a common procedure in general surgery. Gastric bypass has been performed laparoscopically for over two decades and multiple techniques are described. The circular stapled anastomosis, one of the earliest methods for gastrojejunostomy, is performed in two ways: a transoral method to introduce the anvil and a transabdominal approach developed later. The former technique requires passing the anvil of the circular stapler through the mouth, down the esophagus, and into the gastric pouch. In the latter method, a gastrotomy is made, the anvil is introduced, and the gastrotomy is stapled off, creating the gastric pouch. This study aims to objectively compare the two methods of circular stapled gastrojejunostomy in terms of surgical site infection (SSI) rate.",

From national database analysis, more restrictive sleeve construction, based on smaller bougie size, has not correlated with greater weight loss. We hypothesize that bougie size is not reflective of actual restriction, or that sleeve restriction does not correlate with weight loss. We performed qualitative and volumetric analysis of immediate post-sleeve contrast studies to determine the association of sleeve restriction with post-operative weight loss and complications. Methods: Between 2010 and 2015, 222 patients underwent immediate post-sleeve contrast studies. Based on standardized vertebral body height assessment by preoperative chest radiograph, sleeve diameter at intervals (including the narrowest point) was measured in mm, and the volume above the narrowest point of the sleeve was calculated. Sleeve shape was assumed as dual-tiered or simple truncated cone based on morphology. Sleeve restriction, morphology and volumetric analysis were associated with clinical outcomes including complications, post-op symptoms, and weight loss at 6 months. Background: Variability in surgical technique resulting in narrowing at the incisura angularis, twisting along the staple line, and retention of the gastric fundus has been implicated in increased gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Standardizing creation of the sleeve based on anatomic landmarks may help produce more consistent sleeve anatomy and improve outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing LSG from January 2016 to November 2016 at a single institution specializing in bariatric surgery was performed (n=271). Patients underwent either traditional LSG with use of a 40F suction bougie to guide creation of the sleeve (n =156) or anatomy-based sleeve gastrectomy (ABS, n=115). ABS was performed using a gastric clamp to maintain predetermined distances from key landmarks (1 cm from gastroesophageal junction, 3 cm from incisura angularis, 6 cm from pylorus) during stapling. Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and post-operative outcomes were compared using chi-square and student's t-tests as required. Helicobacter pylori (HP) is prevalent in up to 50% of the population worldwide with increased rates observed in the bariatric population. Bariatric surgery has seen a rapid expansion over the last 20 years with the growing rates of severe obesity. Higher HP rates are thought to be associated with increased rates of postoperative complications including increased marginal ulceration and leak rates. Accordingly, some bariatric centers have adopted routine pre-operative screening and HP eradication programs. Yet, while HP correlation with gastritis and malignancy has now been well defined, its impact on patients undergoing bariatric surgery remains unclear. Background: The risk of developing a hiatal hernia in the obese population is 4.2 fold compared to patients with a BMI \\30. Most hiatal hernias after bariatric surgery are asymptomatic and when symptoms are present they may be difficult to differentiate from overeating or maladaptive eating habits. The aim of this study was to define the risk and symptoms associated with a hiatal hernia in the post-bariatric surgery cohort. Methods: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data for patients who underwent laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair who previously had primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Data collection spanned a five-year interval (7/2012-6/2017). Preoperative and follow up data were collected from medical records and questionnaires in the clinic or by telephone. Variables obtained include age, gender, psychiatric history, pre-index procedure BMI, pre-hiatal hernia repair BMI, post-hernia repair BMI, pre and post operative symptoms, and associated morbidity. All hiatal hernia repairs were done laparoscopically, with posterior cruroplasty after circumferential hiatal dissection. Results: We identified 30 patients with a symptomatic hiatal hernia who had previously (range: 1-23 years) underwent bariatric surgery. Fourteen RYGB patients presented at a mean of 10.7 years compared to 16 SG patients who presented at a mean of 3.4 years after index procedure. Diagnosis was by a combination of UGI (67%), CT scan (50%) and EGD (27%). Mean follow up was 8.6 months (range: 1-32 months). Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair was successfully performed in all 30 patients with 0% mortality. Dysphagia and regurgitative symptoms markedly improved in [ 85% of patients however, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain were not changed in 20-30% of patients ( Figure) .",

            "text": "Mid-Term Outcomes of Sleeve Introduction: Obese patients suffer from multiple organ comorbidities which contribute to a shortened lifespan. One of the effects of obesity is thought to be pseudotumor cerebri, which is secondary to increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of an obstruction. Over the past two years, we have measured ICP after insufflating with a laparoscopy device. We found that ICP increases dramatically and it correlates with the amount of insufflation in the abdomen. Over the years, there have been studies in obese patients and intra-abdominal pressure. These studies have shown that some obese patients have an intra-abdominal pressure of 15-18 mmHg. Increasing intraabdominal pressure is thought to escalate intracranial pressure (ICP). The objective of this pilot study was to observed change in ICP after the raising intra-abdominal pressure. Method: In this retrospective chart review preliminary study, pressure in each of the patients either normal pressure hydrocephalous or high pressure hydrocephalous receiving a ventricle shunt were measured by manometer. Once the shunt was placed into the ventricle, we attached a manometer to measure the opening pressure. After we accessed the abdominal cavity using the standardoptiview technique, we created a pneumoperitoneum. After achieving an intraabominal pressure of 15mmhg, were measured the ICP using the manometer. SPSS software version 24 was used for data analysis. Paired t-test was applied on ICP before and after the procedure. Introduction: Postoperative bleeding represents an infrequent, yet serious complication after bariatric surgery. Differences in the rate of postoperative bleeding reported for the two most common weight loss procedures-laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)-are ostensibly confounded by patient and surgeon specific preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors, in particular, by the utilization of staple line reinforcement or oversewing. With this understanding, we aim to use a large national database to definitively characterize differences in bleeding rates between LSG and LRYGB. Conclusions: After appropriate risk-matching, LSG patients have a reduced likelihood of a postoperative bleeding event compared to those undergoing LRYGB. This difference is likely more pronounced with intraoperative securing of the staple line via oversew, buttress or an alternative method. These findings from a large national database represent an important consideration for surgeons and patients alike when evaluating the appropriate bariatric operation.",

            "text": "Background: Bariatric surgery has shown to be the most effective treatment, with documented improvement in obesity-related comorbidities. The type of health insurance coverage plays an important role in the access to bariatric surgery, but might also affect postoperative outcomes. The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in outcomes based on the type of insurance 12 months after bariatric surgery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all the patients that underwent bariatric surgery at our institution from 2010 to 2016. We divided the patients into two groups, based on the type of insurance, Private (group one), and Public (group two). We compared demographics and 12 months outcomes between the groups, using t-test for continuous variables and chi-square for categorical variables. We also compared 12 months estimated BMI loss between 8 different private insurances using ANOVA. Introduction: Bariatric surgeons are now performing primary and revisional procedures on the extremes of age. There is controversy surrounding the safety and effectiveness of bariatric surgery among older age groups compared to younger age groups. To address this knowledge gap, we designed a study assessing short-term bariatric surgery outcomes among various age groupings across a large national database. Methods and Procedures: De-identified patient data across 2015 from the MBSAQIP registry was used. Age groupings were organized into young, middle-aged, and older adults (in years) as follows: \\40, 40-60, and [60, respectively. The following 30-day outcomes were evaluated between all possible pairwise age groupings: mortality, surgical site infection (SSI), and readmission; logistic regression was used to compare outcomes between age groupings controlling for primary vs. revisional index operation, patient factors, and procedure factors. A p value of \\0.05 was deemed statistically significant.",

Older adults had significantly worse outcomes than middle-aged and younger adults, respectively, for over 100 comparisons across all 3 outcomes; in contrast, younger adults had significantly worse outcomes than middle-aged adults for only 14 comparisons across SSI and readmission. For primary bariatric cases, older adults had significantly higher mortality rates than middle-aged and younger adults, respectively, in the following categories: ASA 3, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). For revisional cases, older adults had significantly higher mortality rates than middle-aged and younger adults, respectively, in the setting of female gender, Caucasian race, or ASA 3. Regarding SSI, older adults undergoing primary LRYGB had significantly higher organ space infections compared to younger adults. In addition, older adults who had revisional LRYGB had significantly higher deep surgical site infections compared to middle-aged adults. Following primary bariatric cases, older adults had significantly higher readmission rates compared to younger adults in the presence of male gender, Caucasian race, ASA 3, COPD, or after LSG. Following revisional cases, older adults had significantly higher readmission rates than middle-aged and younger adults, respectively, in the setting of pre-operative chronic steroid use. Conclusions: Overall, older adults had worse short-term outcomes compared to their younger counterparts following primary and revisional cases. Further research is required to investigate these findings with the goal of targeting interventions to improve outcomes among bariatric surgical patients. Background: The obesity epidemic in the United States has been accompanied by surge in bariatric surgery. Nearly 200,000 bariatric procedures were performed in the US in 2015, 23% of which involved Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RNYGB). While RNYGB has proven an effective tool in combating obesity, it also alters a patient's anatomy in a way that makes traditional ERCP a difficult, if not impossible option for interrogating the common bile duct. One way to approach the post-RNYGB patient with obstructive jaundice is to access the peritoneal cavity via a laparoscopic/ robotic approach followed by direct cannulation of the gastric remnant with a laparoscopic port, allowing passage of an endoscope. The aim of this study was to evaluate our single center experience with minimally-invasive transgastric ERCP (TG-ERCP) from 2010 to 2017. Methods: We compiled a list of all patients who underwent laparoscopically or robotically assisted TG-ERCP at our institution from 2010-2017. We then examined patient demographics, procedural details, postoperative outcomes, and success rate, with success defined as cannulation of the ampulla, clearance of obstruction if present (stones/sludge/stenotic ampulla), and completion imaging of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Results: 40 patients were included in the study. 2 cases were performed robotically (5%), and 38 laparoscopically (95%). ERCP was successful in 36 cases (90%). All 4 unsuccessful attempts were aborted when the endoscopist was unable to pass the scope through a tight pylorus. Median time of operation was 163 minutes (199 minutes if concomitant cholecystectomy was performed, 159 minutes if not). Median length of stay after operation was 2 days (range 1-14 days). Median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 50 mL. Post ERCP pancreatitis occurred in 3 patients (8.3%), and was mild and self limited in all cases. 2 patients had postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion. Both of these had concomitant cholecystectomy. Discussion: In patients with biliary obstruction and anatomy not suitable for traditional ERCP, TG-ERCP is a viable option. It can be performed with in a minimally invasive fashion (either laparoscopically or robotically) with a high success rate and low morbidity. As the population of patients who have undergone RNYGB continues to grow, so does the likelihood of encountering one with obstructive jaundice. TG-ERCP, therefore, should be thought of as an essential tool in the armamentarium of the general surgeon. Introduction: Primary palmar hyperhidrosis (PH) is a pathological condition of over perspiration caused by body produces an excessive amount of sweat. This disorder affects to decrease quality of life of patients. Thoracoscopic sympathectomy is minimally invasive and an effective procedure to treat hyperhidrosis. Different of level of sympathectomy has been debate for the best outcomes. Many researchers studied about short term outcomes but no empirical research evidences long term outcomes of thoracoscopic sympathectomy in Thailand. This study purposed to evaluate and compare the long term clinical outcomes between patients who underwent T3 and T4 thoracoscopic sympathectomy for PH with particular attention to patient satisfaction and quality of life. Methods and Procedures: Sixty patients with PH underwent thoracoscopic sympathectomy. Patients were divided into two groups by the level of thoracoscopic sympathectomy as T3 group and T4 group. They were investigated the improvement of sweating, compensatory sweating, satisfaction and quality of life. The long-term investigation was designed to examine clinical outcomes at before surgery, six months after surgery, 1 year after surgery, 3 years after surgery, and last follow up days were compared within group and between of T3 and T4 group. They were subjected to telephone interview using multiple questionnaires to investigate surgery outcomes, degree of satisfaction, and quality of life improvement. Results: Sixty patients responded to the telephone interview. Patients demographic data and also recurrence rate of PH between T3 and T4 group was not significant different (p=0.353). Both groups improved severity of sweating without any statistical significant. But the T4 thoracoscopic sympathectomy led to significantly lower incidence of compensatory hyperhidrosis when compared with T3 group at back and trunk sites. The T4 group had higher overall satisfaction than T3 group with was not significantly different. Long term result are followed after 3 years.",

The axillary approach makes it difficult to visualize the opposite lobe. The anterior chest wall approach utilizes port access at various positions on the anterior chest wall depending on the surgeon. This technique also allows bilateral neck exploration. Hence we have been able to perform total thyroidectomies with central compartment clearance for papillary carcinoma and near-total thyroidectomies for large multinodular goiters, Materials and Methods: Three incisions Subplatysmal plane Pneumoinsufflation with carbon dioxide (CO2) Ports Creating a subplatysmal palne Dissection begins at the inferior pole Posterior dissection Clipping superior thyroid vessels Specimen freed up Thyroid lobectomy was performed in the twenty cases.",

Conclusion: Three-year short-term followed up TOETVA in thyroid cancer has shown less complication and no recurrence cancer. Objective of the Study: Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) in gastric cancer has been investigated for almost two decades in an effort to reduce operative morbidity. Indocyanine green (ICG) with enhanced infrared visualization is one technique with increasing evidence for clinical use. We are the first to systematically review and perform metaanalysis to assess the diagnostic utility of ICG and infrared electronic endoscopy (IREE) or near infrared fluorescent imaging (NIFI) for SNNS exclusively in gastric cancer. Methods and Procedures: A search of electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library using search terms \"gastric/stomach\" AND \"tumor/carcinoma/cancer/neoplasm/adenocarcinoma/malignancy\" AND \"indocyanine green\" was completed in May 2017. All human, English language randomized control trials, non-randomized studies, and case series were evaluated. Articles were selected by two independent reviewers based on the following major inclusion criteria: (1) diagnostic accuracy study design; (2) indocyanine green was injected at tumor site; (3) IREE or NIFI was used for intraoperative visualization. The primary outcomes of interest were identification rate, sensitivity and specificity. 327 titles or abstracts were screened after removing duplicates. The quality of all included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Results: Ten full text studies were selected for meta-analysis. A total of 643 patients were identified with the majority of patients possessing T1 tumors (79.8%). Pooled identification rate, diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity and specificity was 0.99 (0.97-1.0), 380.0 (68.71-2101), 0.87 (0.80-0.93) and 1.00 (0.99-1.00) respectively. The summary receiver operator characteristic for ICG+IREE/NIFI demonstrated a test accuracy of 98.3%. Subgroup analysis found improved test performance for studies with low risk QUADAS-2 scores, studies published after 2010 and submucosal ICG injection. IREE had improved diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity and identification rate compared to NIFI. Heterogeneity among studies ranged from low (I2 \\25%) to high (I2 [75%).",

            "text": "Conclusions: The idea of SNNS in gastric cancer is intriguing because of the potential to limit operative morbidity. We found encouraging results regarding the accuracy, diagnostic odds ratio and specificity of the test. The sensitivity was not optimal but may be improved by a carefully planned and strict protocol to augment the technique. Given the limited number and heterogeneity of studies, our results must be viewed with caution. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility, cost effectiveness and safety of Single incision laparoscopic surgery using routine laparoscopy instruments. Method: 64 cases of acute appendicitis and 56 cases of symptomatic gallstone disease were included in study. 120 cases were enrolled in study and prospective observational study was performed. Ruptured appendicitis/abscess formation were excluded from study. Similarly Empyema Gallbladder/Gallbladder perforation were also excluded. Results: Total 120 cases included; 64 cases of Appendicitis and 56 cases of symptomatic Cholelithiasis. Mean age of appendectomy group was 28.71\u00b19.69 years and mean age of cholecystectomy group was 36.71\u00b110.48 years. In our study, Mean operative time for SIL Appendectomy was 42.04\u00b15.74 min. Post-operative fever was noted in 10 cases (14.25%). Mean post-operative pain as per VAS score taken after 24 hours, on POD 2 was 2.14. Average post op stay in hospital was 2.14 days, Port site infection occurred in one case (4.17%). Patient satisfaction score obtained on the scale of 1-10 on one month follow up was 7.95, while scar cosmesis score was 7.9. In our study, 56 cases underwent SIL cholecystectomy, of which 21 were male (36.8%) and 35 were females (41.2%), and mean age of patients was 36.71yrs. Mean operative time in our study was 75.21 min, Mean post-operative pain taken on POD 2 as per VAS score was 2.91, Mean post-operative hospital stay was 2.1 days, Port site infections occurred in 2 cases. Post-op fever was noted in 6 cases, post-operative patient satisfaction score obtained at 1 month follow up was 7.73 and Scar score of 7.84 on the scale of 0-10. No case required drain placement and conversion. Conclusion: SILS can be performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments especially in a government setup where per capita economic burden to patient will be less. Though it has more operative time, it has comparably less post-operative hospital stay, causes less pain, and has significantly more patient satisfaction regarding post-operative scar and cosmesis. Since SILS has more patient acceptance and satisfaction, it can be offered to all patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. It is very useful in government setup where lower economic class of patients will also benefit, irrespective of unavailability of special instruments and financial constraints, as it can be performed using routine laparoscopic instruments.",

Introduction: For the transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) for groin hernia, single port surgery (SPS) has been reported to reduce the abdominal wall damages. To reduce the length of the umbilical scar and to keep the view of triangulation, we use one needle forceps plus SPS. Patients and Methods: From May 2014 to July 2017, 168 consecutive TAPP patients were retrospectively investigated. There were 139 male and 29 female. We use two 5 mm ports (1 for the scope and 1 for the operator's right hand forceps) through an umbilical multi-channel port and additional 3 mm needle instrument is pierced above the pubic bone. A 5 mm flexible scope allowed us to keep the triangular formation easily. We studied the safety and usefulness of this method from the viewpoints of operation time and the complications. Results: Median operation time of single side hernia (135 cases) was 77 min (38-152) and the bilateral case (33 cases) was 139 min (91-269). Five cases needed one or two additional 5 mm ports, and one case with severe preperitoneal adhesion due to the previous prostate cancer surgery was converted to open method because of the venous bleeding. Other complications were 2 spermatic cord injury and 3 postoperative seroma that required the percutaneous puncture. Umbilical scars and the pierced needle instrument scars became gradually invisible within 1 or 2 months. There were no incisional hernia nor wound infections in our series. These data was comparable to the conventional laparoscopic hernia repairs.",

Retraction of the left hepatic lobe was easy with use of the 12-mm FJ Clip and a 6-mm Penrose drain. For #4 lymph node dissection, we used the FJ Clip to grasp the upper part of the stomach, inserted the F Loop Plus from the upper right abdomen. For #6 dissection, we grasped the pyloric vestibule and pulled it leftward. For dissection of the upper edge of the pancreas, we grasped the left gastric arteriovenous pedicle and pulled it toward the abdomen. The FJ Clip's grasp and traction exerted on the stomach wall were strong and effective, and there was little organ damage. Reconstruction (Roux-Y) or double tract were performed within the abdominal cavity by hand-sewn purse string suture of the esophageal stump, insertion of an anvil, and use of an automated anastomosis device. We have experienced 2 total and 3 proximally cases to date, but there have been no complications, and both intraoperative bleeding and operation time were within normal limits. Conclusion: We believe the FJ Clip and F Loop Plus will replace conventional forceps for various tasks in reduced port gastrectomy. Introduction: Pulmonary anatomical resection is considered as standard treatment for early staged lung cancer. Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (uVATS) has recently showed favorable surgical outcomes, but remains technically demanding, especially in a complex procedure such as anatomic segmentectomy. Needlescopic instruments facilitates complex laparoscopic surgeries with nearly painless and scarless postoperative outcomes, however, its utilization of thoracoscopic surgery were mostly for minor procedures such as bullectomy and sympathectomy. We presented our initial experience of lung cancer surgery performed by uniportal VATS and additional needlescopic instruments, and we also compare the operative results with conventional uniportal VATS. Methods: From December 2016 to August 2017, 75 consecutive patients with lung cancer undergoing anatomical lung resections including lobectomies and segmentectomies were reviewed retrospectively. Of these 75 patients, 39 patients received conventional uniportal VATS (uVATS), and 36 patients received needlescopic-assisted uniportal VATS (NA-uVATS).

The most common (66.7%) method of repair included suturing mesh to the diaphragmatic portion of the defect and securing the anterior-inferior edge to anterior abdominal wall with transfascial sutures and/or tacks. Four patients (26.7%) underwent primary repair. Average defect and mesh size was 37.2 cm 2 and 226.4 cm 2 , respectively. Three patients (20%) underwent a concomitant paraesophageal hernia repair. Mean EBL and length of stay was 31 mL (range 10-125 mL) and 2.7 days (range 1-7 days). Postoperative morbidity included transient postoperative hypoxemia (2 patients) and pleural effusion (1) . There was no mortality, mesh complications or recurrences with a mean follow-up of 36 months. Conclusions: Morgagni hernias patients were more often older, obese, and women. These hernias remained unrepaired in 87% of patients despite their having had previous abdominal surgery. A laparoscopic or robotic approach offers an effective hernia repair with minimal complications, short hospital stay, and excellent long-term results for both elective and acute operations. Mesh repair, sutured to the diaphragm and sutured/tacked to the abdominal wall, appears to be a very successful means to repair larger defects. Introduction: Hydatidosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus. It is endemic in the Mediterranean, South America and middle east. It is a systemic disease wherein lungs are the second most common organ involved, after liver. Radio-imaging plays an important role in diagnosing and determining the extent of the disease. Surgical enucleation of cyst has been the classical treatment for this disease. Bilateral lung involvement has been traditionally treated by median sternotomy or a bilateral thoracotomy. Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is an effective surgical approach in such settings.",

The surgical procedure has been shifting from laparoscopic assisted to complete laparoscopic surgery. In this study, we evaluated the outcomes and safety of the laparoscopic assisted distal gastrectomy. Methods: For the marking of the oral side transecting line, the clipping at oral side of cancer lesion was performed by gastro-endoscopy before surgery. The lymph node dissection (D1+/D2) is performed laparoscopically. As the dissection of the pancreatic superior region, the assistant hold the left gastric artery and keep the good view by retracting the pancreas. The common hepatic artery and proximal side of splenic artery are exposed. Both sides of the left gastric artery and vein are exposed. Left gastric vein and left gastric artery are cut after clipping and sealing. Lymph node dissention of hepato-duodenal ligament is done and right gastric artery is cut after clipping and sealing. Minor curvature of upper gastric wall is exposed (No 1, 3 dissection). Billroth I reconstruction by the Circular Stapler (CDH) is performed. Through the upper median incision with 5 cm, operator pulls out the stomach and transects the oral side of stomach with linear stapler after palpating the clips. Duodenum is transected after purse string suture. Gastroduodenal anastomosis is performed by CDH. Results: Two hundred cases were analyzed. The operation time, blood loss and the conversion to open surgery rate were 175 minutes, 40 ml, and 1.0%, respectively. As postoperative complications, anastomotic failure, pancreatic fistula and postoperative bleeding were 2%, 1.5% and 1%, respectively. The reoperation rate was 2%.

Searching for better outcomes in inguinal hernia repair, surgeons have looked for new and less invasive alternatives such as single-incision surgery, single-port surgery and Mini. Minilaparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (Mini-TAPP) demonstrates some of the known advantages of Mini general surgery procedures such as enhanced visualization, improved dexterity and great cosmetic outcome. It is safe and reproducible since it does not differ from standard laparoscopy. Introduction: The celiac plexus is a structure located in the retroperitoneum, at the level of the lumbar vertebra, which is located in the prevertebral region and has sympathetic fibers. Patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer and associated pain, one of the management strategies is pain control. Neurolysis of the celiac pleural by laparoscopy was first reported in humans in 2006 in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma with excellent results. Experience will be shown in the simplification of the technique for the procedure. Method: Neurolysis of the celiac pleura was performed in 89 patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, stomach 52%, pancreas 23% liver 14% other 11%, no complications associated with the procedure, pain improvement was achieved in 80% of patients after process. The standardization of the technique by laparoscopy and its simplification, has made this procedure that is replicable and safe. Description of the technique: patient in French position, technique of 3 trocars, umbilical trocar 10 mm and 2 trocars of 5 mm paraumbilical, staging laparoscopy is performed and sampling if necessary, is identified in the region of the lowercurvature of the stomach, the celiac trunk and the emergence of the left gastric artery are identified and 20cc of 90% alcohol diluted to the medium in the lateral fatty bearing are instilled through a pericranial 22 under direct vision, verifying the non-arterial instillation of the alcohol. There were no complications related to the procedure. Results: We report the experience of one group who underwent celiac pleura neurolysis in 89 patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, gastric cancer 52%, pancreatic cancer 23%, liver cancer 14% and another 11%. The most frequent pathology report was adenocarcinoma, 80% of the patients were managed at 24 hours with sustained effects, up to 6 months of follow-up.

Due to its metallic property, it is not only expensive but also causes artifacts on imaging studies and often migrates into CBD. This study compares the traditional standard metallic clip with Hem-O-Lock used in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in regard of the safety and efficacy?.",

Paradigm shifts in the management of these cases has, however, improved the mortality in such cases. It can be expected that improvements in management, when combined with the benefits of laparoscopy, will demonstrate positive impacts upon treatment outcomes. Methods: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was referenced for inpatient stays for the years 2004 to 2014. Abdominal trauma cases were selected and identified as hollow (HO) or solid organ (SO) type, and as blunt or penetrating. The trauma subset was then scanned for the presence of discrete laparoscopic procedures, laparotomy, and converted cases, and flagged accordingly. Conclusion: Utilization of laparoscopy in treatment of intraabdominal solid and hollow organs injury increases over time. Although current analysis based on available HCUP NIS data include any procedures done during post-traumatic hospitalization, its results can lead to conclusion that minimally invasive technique is being utilized in increased fashion.",

The long-term rate of incisional hernia after SILS colectomy is unknown, and the risk factors of incisional hernia formation is not fully elucidated. Methods and Procedures: This is a retrospective from a prospectively collected database. The investigation took place in a high-volume multidisciplinary tertiary private hospital in Japan. Introduction: Laparoscopic approach in the acute surgical care setting continues to be underutilized. We aim to report the successful diagnostic and therapeutic use of laparoscopy in the management of a nontoxic patient presenting with acute abdomen and to highlight the benefits of a minimally invasive approach without added morbidity. Case Report: Presented is a 52-year-old male with history of CAD s/p CABGx4 two years prior and no abdominal surgical history who presented to the ED with sudden onset severe, diffuse, abdominal pain of six-hour duration with N/V. There was no trauma to the abdomen. He had mildmoderate hypertension, but was otherwise hemodynamically stable. On examination, the patient was in severe distress and writhing in pain. FAST exam was unable to be performed secondary to pain. CTA of the abdomen revealed mesenteric abnormalities with associated small bowel edema in the RLQ suspicious for small bowel ischemia. He was taken to the OR for diagnostic laparoscopy. He was found to have an omental adhesive band to the abdominal wall with herniation of the small bowel through the small opening. Approximately 70 cm of ischemic, nonviable small bowel was resected and anastomosed intracorporeally. He tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home on post-operative day 3. Discussion: Primary omental related internal herniation of small bowel is exceedingly rare. There have been only few cases reported in the literature (1, 2, 3, 4) . Two were diagnosed on exploratory laparotomy, one on diagnostic laparoscopy and one at autopsy. The one who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy did not require bowel resection. In presenting this case, we hope to illustrate the role of laparoscopy in the management of acute abdominal pain due to bowel compromise.",

In a second patient with a smaller (698 cm) classic right-sided anterior diaphragmatic defect we similarly performed laparoscopic trans-abdominal suturing using the Endo-Close to traverse both the anterior and posterior fascia and the TI-KNOT to secure the sutures in order to perform a primary repair of the hernia.

Combined Laparoscopic Splenectomy and cholecystectomy in those patients is technically more demanding and needs reorientation of visual-motor skills. Presentation of Case: Herein, we report a 16 year old girl presented with yellowish discoloration and left hypochondrium and epigastric pain diagnosed as Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS). The patient had not been diagnosed as situs inversus totalis before. The patient exhibit a left sided \"Murphy's sign\" and spleen palpable in right hypochondruim. Diagnosis of situs inversus totalis was confirmed with Ultrasound, Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonant Image (MRI) with enlarged right sided spleen and presence of multiplegall bladder stones with no intra or extrabiliary duct dilatation. The patient underwent combined laparoscopic Splenectomy and cholecystectomy as treatment of Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS). Discussion: Feasibility and technical difficulty in diagnosis and treatment of such case pose challenge problem due to the contra lateral disposition of the viscera. Difficulty is the laparoscopic technique encountered in skelatonizing the structures in Calot's triangle, which consume extra time than normally located gall bladder with right sided standing surgeon and the position changed to left sided standing surgeon during splenectomy. In review up to date medical literature this is the first case reported worldwide. Conclusion: Provided that the technique is performed by an experienced surgical team, concomitant laparoscopic splenectomy and cholecystectomy in situs inversus totalis is a safe and feasible procedure and may be considered for coexisting spleen and gallbladder disease as in Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) as changes in anatomical disposition of organ not only influence the localization of symptoms and signs arising from a diseased organ but also imposes special demands on the diagnosis and surgical skills of the surgeon. Objective: To identify the preference among medical students of the following surgical approaches: open surgery, conventional laparoscopy, minilaparoscopy (MINI), Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and robotic surgery.",

Background: Lymph node (LN) dissection around recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is one of the most important and difficult procedure in esophageal cancer surgery because of high rate of LN metastasis and risk of RLN palsy. Especially around left RLN, the surgical area is far and narrow by thoracic approach which tends to results in insufficient LN dissection. Therefore, we tried to remove this LN by imaging lymphatic chain to dissect sufficient LN. Surgical Procedure: We perform thoracoscopic esophagectomy by semi-prone position using 6-10 mmHg thoracic air pressure. After dissection of right RLN LN, middle and lower esophagus, encircle the esophagus at the level of bifurcation of bronchus and pull toward right side by tape to dissect the dorsal and left side of upper esophagus. Dissect the tissue including left RLN LN from trachea by pulling esophagus up to dorsal side and try to move this tissue toward dorsal side of left RLN so that this RLN LN tissue can recognize as the \"lymphatic chain\". To increase the mobility of esophagus, cut the esophagus at the level of aortic arch and pull further up this upper esophagus to dorsal side. Cut the esophageal branch of RLN and separate this lymphatic chain from RLN. At the end of thoracic procedure, this lymphatic chain is attached to upper esophagus. After the upper esophagus has pulled out from cervical site, lymphatic chain can easily recognize at the esophageal wall.",

We initiated a quality improvement project, seeking to assess if we could safely forego placement of foley and NGT along with the UGI, unless clinically indicated. Our aim was to determine if this decreased overall length of stay (LOS), and how often and which demographic of patients needed placement of foley or NGT postoperatively. Methods and Procedures: We reviewed patients who had undergone laparoscopic hiatal hernia surgery between 2010 and 2016 under a single thoracic surgeon. Patients were excluded for poor esophageal motility (peristalsis \\70%), previous esophageal surgery, and presence of a paraesophageal hernia (PEH) with over 50% of the stomach contained in the chest. Eligible patients were further stratified into two groups: fast track and non-fast track. Fast track was defined as patients who left the operating room (OR) with no foley or NGT, and did not receive a routine UGI on POD one. Non-fast track was defined as patients who left the OR with a foley and NGT and received a routine UGI on POD one. LOS was measured in hours from the start of surgery to the time of discharge. Results: Of the 75 patients included, 42 were categorized as fast track and 33 as non-fast track. The two groups were similar in terms of age, gender, BMI and ASA; however, the fast track group had fewer paraesophageal hernias and shorter surgery times [Table] . The hospital LOS, however, was significantly shorter in the fast track group, even though there were more postoperative urinary catheters utilized. No patients in fast track group needed an NGT placed or UGI ordered during initial stay.",

The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (CAG) has implemented the Colonoscopy Skills Improvement (CSI) program across Canada with a goal of improving colonoscopy quality. The programs' efficacy has not yet been formally assessed. This retrospective cohort study was performed on fourteen endoscopists practicing in a tertiary referral center who have undergone CSI training between October 2014 and December 2015. Procedural data were collected before and after CSI training. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) and entered into SPSS version 20.0 for analysis. Student's T-test was used to compare groups for continuous data; Chi-squared tests were used for categorical data. Data were collected for a total of 3783 procedures; 2383 were done before CSI training and 1400 procedures since CSI training. Our sample size provided 80% power to detect a mean difference in ADR improvement of 5%. The most common indication for colonoscopy was family history of colorectal cancer in 970 (25.6%) patients.

Conclusively, Scientists are utilizing time and resource to salvage this nemesis which is of global burden. Classical and Novel biomarkers are important for treatment as well as pre-post diagnosis of GC. Major causes for this disease are cigarette smoking, infection by helicobacter pylori, atrophic gastritis, male sex, and high salt intake.

Antibiotic treatment alone has been shown feasible in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. In clinical practice surgical treatment can be delayed due to a multitude of medical and logistical reasons. This study evaluates the relation between timing of surgery to outcomes. Methods and Procedures: 120 consecutive adult patients undergoing appendectomy in a teaching community hospital were risk stratified using the ACS Risk Calculator.

We hypothesize that a multidisciplinary bariatric team will be better equipped to recognize and diagnose these conditions. This study hopes to quantify that a patient focused approach leads to increased recognition of obesity-associated comorbidities, thus improving quality of care and surgical outcomes. Methods and Procedure: A retrospective medical chart review of patients who underwent bariatric surgery from 12/1/15 to 12/1/16 was performed comparing patient problem lists obtained from their primary care providers upon entry into the bariatric program, and the final problem list generated after evaluation by the program's multidisciplinary team. The total number and specific comorbidities identified before and after multidisciplinary team evaluation was analyzed with a paired t-test and MANOVA, respectively. Comparison of the number of comorbidities identified against specific patient demographics was conducted using paired t-test.",

The total number of comorbidities identified after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team was significantly greater (p=.000), with the average number of comorbidities diagnosed before and after being 3.65 and 6.61, respectively. A significant increase (p\\0.05) in the identification of comorbidities before and after evaluation were noted for all demographics, and no disparities regarding gender, age, marital status, employment status, BMI, or ethnicity where identified. Conclusion: Patients with obesity unknowingly suffer from many obesity-associated comorbidities simply because their health care providers have failed to recognize the existence of these conditions. Surprisingly, this include diseases that are highly associated with obesity, such as OSA and T2DM, for which obese patients should be screened. Although the root of this dereliction is yet to be determined, insufficient obesity-focused education and inherent weight bias among providers must be considered. Assessment by a multidisciplinary bariatric team resulted in the identification and treatment of an increased number of comorbidities in this patient population. Increased recognition of obesity-related comorbidities improves quality of care, which can translate into improved surgical outcomes.",

Such interruptions can diminish perceptions of authority and compromise women's self-confidence. On Twitter, users cannot be interrupted in the same way they can be in live conversation. Thus the platform may provide a means for women to overcome this obstacle. To determine the degree to which women surgeon leaders utilize Twitter compared to their male colleagues, we examined the Twitter accounts and activity of the leaders of three national surgical societies. Methods and Procedures: Lists of surgeons holding leadership positions in three surgical societies; the American College of Surgeons, the Academic Association of Surgery, and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, were obtained and duplicate names were deleted. Table 1 details the organizations and leadership positions included. The Twitter accounts of these leaders were then identified and confirmed by reviewing the accounts for surgical content. Account duration was calculated from the join date. The number of tweets, accounts following, followers, and likes were recorded for each account. Outliers were defined as two standard deviations from the mean. Results: One hundred sixty-eight men and 64 women surgeon leaders were identified. Forty-nine percent of the men and 66% of the women were found to have Twitter accounts. Mean account durations for men and women were similar, 4.6 years and 4.1 years, respectively. Outliers for total tweets (7 men, 1 women), accounts following (5 men), followers (2 men), and likes (3 men) were excluded from analyses. Almost all positive outliers were men. There were no negative outliers. Overall, excluding the outliers, there were no significant differences between men and women in any metric. Conclusion: Among leaders in the surgical organizations analyzed, a higher percentage of women than men have Twitter accounts. Those with the greatest number of tweets, accounts following, followers, and likes, however, are overwhelmingly male. Thus, although women in this sample were more likely than the men to have Twitter accounts, men were more likely to gain influence through their accounts. Increasing women's influence in this public forum may position them as much-needed role models for the current and next generations. Surgical societies may help reduce the disparity in women's representation in surgical fields through education of their members on how to use social media.",

Meanwhile, the FSRS contains 16 different tasks, half of which on human-machine interaction and another half on operative interaction. Both curriculums appear to lack contents on managing adverse events in robotic surgery. According to FDA data, 4,798 adverse events were reported per 100,000 surgeries, of which (i) 40% relates to broken pieces of surgical instruments falling into patients, (ii) 19.1% pertains to burning holes in tissue from electric arching, and (iii) 16.9% relates to unexpected operations of the instrument such as power outage and issues with electrosurgical units. Thus, medical professionals should be trained to manage common adverse events in robotic surgery. For FRS, augmenting the five current scenarios in the communication section with common adverse events (i.e., broken pieces falling into patients) would minimize complications under abnormal circumstances. For FSRS, the most logical method would be augmenting the Operative Interaction tasks with adverse events to train medical professionals. Conclusion: We discovered universal curriculums on robotic surgery lack education contents for training medical professionals to manage adverse events and out of the 4,798 procedures, 4382 (91.3%) pertained to device malfunction. To protect the patient's health, universal curriculums must incorporate contents preparing medical professionals in responding to adverse events, particularly device malfunctions, during robotic surgeries. Introduction: This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the new Senhance robotic system (Transenterix) for laparoscopic cholecystectomies. We report the first single-institutional experience utilizing this new robotic platform.",

The Senhance surgical system is a new robotic platform that consists of a cockpit, manipulator arm and a connection node ( Figure 1 ). This new system provides robotic surgery with numerous advantages including eye-tracking camera control system, haptic feedback, reusable endoscopic instruments, and a high configuration versatility due to total independency of the manipulator arms. Patients were between 18 and 80 years of age, eligible for a laparoscopic procedure with general anesthesia, had no life-threatening disease with a life-expectancy of less than 12 month and a BMI\\ 40. A retrospective review of a variety of prospectively collected pre-, peri-and postoperative data including but not limited to patient demographics, intraoperative as well as postoperative complications was performed. Cholecystectomies were performed by expert level laparoscopic surgeons. Results: The standard laparoscopic technique and setup was easily applicable to the Senhance robotic system for this particular surgery. Operative time and perioperative complications were comparable to reports of standard laparoscopic cholecystectomies. There was no significant learning curve detected in our case series. Conclusion: We report the first experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomies using the new Senhance robotic system. There were no major perioperative complications and operative time was comparable to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomies well reported in the literature. This case series suggests that the Senhance robotic system can be safely and easily used for laparoscopic cholecystectomies by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.",

            "text": "Background: The ergonomic benefits or robotic surgery for the health of the surgeon are widely touted as benefits of this technique, though concern remains over a perception of increased risk of injury to patients, particularly in the novice robotic surgeon. Injury to the bedside surgeon and assistants due to robotic movement can also occur, though not previously reported. We describe a finger fracture to the bedside surgeon due to entrapment between robotic arms and discuss potential risks to the surgeon in robotic procedures. Procedure: A distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed utilizing the DaVinci SI system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). During the operation, hemorrhage was encountered which required an instrument exchange that was delayed by self-testing failures. After the instrument was validated and advanced into the field by the bedside surgeon, the operator abruptly took control of the device to reposition. The external portion of the active arm was then rapidly and forcefully propelled laterally toward a stationary retracting arm. The bedside surgeon's hand was still engaged on the instrument being inserted and became trapped between the two arms, leading to a right middle finger crush injury. Results: The bedside surgeon sustained a fracture to the distal phalanx at the insertion of the flexor tendon with significant hyperextension of the joint. There was temporary paresthesia of the fingertip. While flexor tendon function was preserved and surgery was not required, the surgeon was required to maintain continuous splinting and was unable to return to full duty for a total of 13 weeks. The surgeon has mild residual hyperextension. Conclusions: While complications to the patient have previously been attributed to the robotic platform, this case demonstrates that there are other inherent hazards to members of the operative team. As is natural with all indirect visual surgical techniques, the operator becomes intensely focused on the internal view and instruments in the field. This spatial separation is accentuated on the robotic platform as the isolated console provides a complete visual field immersion, no tactile feedback, and a disconnect between the rapid, sizeable outward arm motions need to produce small internal movements. Given the need for maximum dexterity internally, the device doesn't have external proximity sensors to prevent arm-arm or arm-operator collisions. While many bedside operators report anecdotes of collisions with the device, this case reveals the forces involved at the human-machine interface can lead to more significant injuries.",

Spigelian hernias represented 73% (n =8) and lumbar hernias 27% (n=3). All patients had primary closure of their defect and 7 patients (64%) had a posterior myofascial release performed. Mesh types placed included polypropylene uncoated (n=7), polypropylene coated (n=3), and biologic (n=1). With uncoated polypropylene mesh placed had peritoneum closed over the mesh. The average length of stat was 1.9 days (Range 0-6 days). There were no recurrences identified over a mean follow up period of 3.1 months (range 0.5-13.2 months). Conclusion: Robotic assisted repair of non-midline abdominal wall hernias is a viable option in the elective setting with no recurrences noted in this case series. The technical advantages of using robotic technology were identified and discussed in detail. These advantages theoretically improve outcomes in these patients however further analysis on long-term outcome and costs will have to be determined in future studies. The inguinal hernia repair has seen several critical improvements in recent times due to the implementation of new techniques, including laparoscopic repair, as well as robotic repair. With over 600,000 inguinal hernia repairs performed annually, it is important to identify the safest and most patient-friendly method. For surgeons, robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery is gaining in popularity for its dexterity and 3D visualization. But despite the growing interest in robotic hernia repairs, there is a scarcity of literature to support its superiority over open inguinal hernia repair. This study hypothesizes that patients who undergo robot assisted laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair will have decreased immediate post-operative pain, shorter recovery room stays, decreased narcotic requirement, and overall decreased pain at follow up compared to open inguinal hernia repair.",

            "text": "In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent either an open or robotic assisted laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair at Stamford Hospital, from July 2015-July 2017. The following characteristics were analyzed for both subsets of patients: gender, BMI, type of repair, operative time, recovery room time, immediate post-operative pain, and post-operative pain at follow up. Our study demonstrated longer average operative time for patients undergoing robotic hernia repair compared to open repair, which was statistically significant (p value=\\0.05). Patients who underwent robotic inguinal hernia repair spent less time in the recovery room compared to patient who underwent open repair. In addition, patients in the robotic hernia group required less narcotics in the recovery room compared to patients who underwent open repair (p value = \\0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between lengths of hospital stay between the two groups. This study highlights several possible advantages of robotic inguinal hernia repair, including lower post-operative pain scores, less narcotic usage required in the post-operative period, as well as shorter recovery room time. The results from this study should increase interest in investigating the superiority of robotic inguinal hernia repair. Future plans for study involve comparing robotic to laparoscopic repair. In addition, we plan to continue to follow the study patients to look at additional qualitative metrics, including time to return to work and time to return to daily activities. Introduction: Buccal mucosal grafts (BMG) are traditionally used in urethral reconstruction. There may be insufficient BMG for applications requiring large amounts of graft, such as urethral stricture after gender affirming phalloplasty. Rectal mucosa is an alternative with less post-operative pain, no impairment in eating and speaking, and larger graft dimension. Laparoscopic transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) has been described by our group. Due to the technical challenges of harvesting a sizable graft within a confined space, we adopted a new approach using the Intuitive da Vinci Xi\u00ae system. We demonstrate the feasibility and safety of a novel technique of Robotic TAMIS (R-TAMIS) in the harvest of rectal mucosa for the purpose of onlay graft urethroplasty. Methods and Procedures: IRB approval was obtained. Three female-to-male transgender adults (age range: 33-53 years) presenting with post-phalloplasty urethral strictures underwent robotic rectal mucosal harvest. The procedure was first rehearsed on an inanimate model using bovine colon. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in lithotomy position. The GelPOINT Path Transanal Access Platform was used. The rectal mucosa was harvested by the robotic instruments after submucosal hydrodissection. Specimen size harvested correlated with clinical surface area needed for urethral reconstruction. Following specimen retrieval, flexible sigmoidoscopy was used to ensure hemostasis. The rectal mucosa graft was placed as an onlay for urethroplasty.",

It constitutes a promising minimally-invasive technique to employ in urethral reconstruction. Demonstrated feasibility and avoidance of the challenging recovery associated with BMG harvest warrants further application and long-term evaluation of this procedure. Prospective studies evaluating graft success, donor site morbidity and long-term outcomes are needed. Introduction: The proportion of robotic minimally invasive procedures that are being performed annually is growing rapidly, specifically in the field of general surgery. A robotic approach to minimally invasive procedures potentially confers a number of benefits ranging from a magnified viewing field to greater attenuation and translation of hand movements leading to improved stability and maneuverability. It is paramount that a robust curriculum is designed for training surgical residents in robotic techniques. The aim of this project is to assess the current state of robotic surgery training at the Ohio State University, with specific regard to whether it is currently temporally effective in addition to establishing a baseline against which the robotic surgery curriculum can be compared. Methods and Procedures: Data were obtained for 199 cases performed at the Ohio State University Hospital East, between January and September of 2017. Case time, date, type, and attending surgeon were recorded and tracked for review. Of the 199 cases, 72 were cholecystectomies, 40 were unilateral inguinal hernia repairs, and 36 were bilateral inguinal hernia repairs-for a total of 148 procedures included in the analysis. Chief Residents were trained in two-month blocks, beginning in January of 2017. Mean console operative times for the first and second months were compared for cholecystectomies as well as unilateral and bilateral inguinal hernia repairs. Results: Mean console time decreased for cholecystectomies (\u22129.0%; N=72), bilateral (\u221216.0%; N=36) and unilateral (\u22121.5%; N=40) inguinal hernia repairs from month one to month two. There was a large amount of variance across training blocks, but there was a systematic improvement in operative time across the training period. Average operation length was shortest for cholecystectomies (m=66.8 min), followed by unilateral inguinal hernia repairs (m=85.3 min), and finally bilateral inguinal hernia repairs (m=111.2 min).",

Compared to standard resection, this type of surgery is safe and feasible without increasing the risk of postoperative complications except the overall rate of clinical pancreatic fistula (PF), which did not result in higher mortality or overall morbidity. Robotic surgery for pNETs enucleation has been rarely described but initials experiences have shown that this approach is associated with favorable outcomes. The aim of this study is to describe three cases of dV\u00aeSi\u2122 pancreatic enucleation for p-NETs located in the uncinate process, in the body and in the posterior aspect of the tail of the pancreas, respectively.

The pancreas was explored: an intraoperative ultrasound was used ensuring negative margins and leaving the MPD intact. Thus, a cross-stitch through the tumour was made routinely in order to pull the tumour. Enucleoresection was carried out with monopolar scissors and bipolar forceps. The tumour was placed into a specimen bag and removed from the trocar port. A drain was always left. Results: Median total operative time was 178 min. No conversion neither intraoperative complications occurred. Median length of stay was 4.6 days. Two patients presented a PF grade A (classification ISGPF) while a PF grade B occurred in case of pancreatic tail NET enucleation.

Introduction: Rectal cancer continues to be a surgical challenge. New technologies must be incorporated into practice and, at the same time, oncologic surgery and overall outcomes must be improved. The use of da Vinci robotic surgery systems has spread rapidly in the field of rectal cancer treatment showing several technical advantages and favorable outcome compared to laparoscopy. Since the introduction of the robotic platform in our Institution in 2013, we have adopted a single-docking robotic technique for rectal resection.

In the complex laparoscopic surgical procedure, there is a problem such as that the laparoscope and the surgical instruments interfere with each other because multiple instruments is concentrated in one place. This problem is significantly appear in the laparoendoscopic single site surgery. Therefore we suggested multi degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator with mantle tube for assisting laparoendoscopic surgery, which manipulator has two flexion and one telescopic mechanisms actuated by wire. It is possible to insert any thin surgical instruments such an endoscope the mantle tube of the multi DOF manipulator, which the manipulator can let those surgical instruments access the operative field from different axis with other instruments.

This surgery was performed through a small subclavian incision and using a wire traction and inserting an endoscope. We have modified and improved our surgical techniques by inventing various surgical instruments. Here we introduce four newly invented surgical instruments, chronologically. Results: We made U-retractor (2000), U-trocar (2005), U-Kelly forceps (2008), and U-suction tube retractor (2013). All surgical instruments were modified from conventional surgical instruments. The U-retractor was a piercing retractor, each end of which had a sharp tip and a retractor. This retractor was inserted from the 3-cm working port outside the body and retracted the muscles effectively. The U-trocar was reversely set from inside to outside to make the working space wider. The U-Kelly forceps which had a special ratchet were made to dissect loose connective tissue around the thyroid gland avoiding injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The U-suction tube retractor facilitated a wider working port and eliminated the mist created by the ultrasonically activated scalpel effectively. Recent data showed no difference of operative time, hoarseness, blood loss and hospital stay between conventional thyroid lobectomy and gasless endoscopic lobectomy. Conclusion: Gasless endoscopic thyroid surgery has been improved in the last 17 years. This procedure made the excision of not only benign thyroid tumors but also small thyroid carcinomas. This operation is still cost effective, because almost all surgical instruments are reusable and is a satisfactory experience to both the patients and surgeons. Objective: To put forward the importance of complete (R0) resection for the treatment of retroperitoneal tumors increasing overall survey. Methods: In this study; 30 patients having the diagnosis of retroperitoneal tumors with different histopathological subtypes whom were hospitalized in Emergency Surgery Department of Istanbul Medical Faculty between the years of 2009 and 2017 were evaluated retrospectively.

            "title": "University of Alberta, 2 Centre for the Advancement of Minimally Invasive Surgery Introduction: The objective of this study was to systematically review the bariatric surgery literature to understand how weight loss is reported. The incidence of obesity has increased globally. According to the World Health Organization more than 600 million were obese in 2014. In the last decade, bariatric surgery has been increasingly utilized as an effective treatment option for severely obese patients. Currently, bariatric surgeries are among the most commonly performed operations. The primary outcome of such procedures is weight loss which has been shown to vary according to the type of surgery. However, there are different methods used to report weight loss which makes it difficult to directly compare outcomes between studies. A previous review by Dixon et al. in 2004 revealed a wide heterogeneity in weight loss reporting. However, there have been no recent reviews on the reporting of weight loss in bariatric surgery. Methods: A search of the MEDLINE electronic database was performed for studies published in 2016 using search terms gastric bypass/sleeve gastrectomy, weight, human, and English. Articles were selected by two independent reviewers based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) adult participant \u226518 years",

Method: In order to verify the effect of Duodenal-jejunal transit on glucose tolerance and diabetes remission in gastric bypass, twenty-two type-2 diabetes Sprague-Dawley rat model established through high fat diet and low dose Streptozotocin (STZ) administered intraperitoneally were assigned to one of three groups: Gastric Bypass with duodenal-jejunal Transit (GB-DJT n=8), Gastric Bypass without duodenal-jejunal transit (RYGB n=8) and SHAM (n=6). Body weight, food intake, blood glucose, as well as meal-stimulated insulin, and Incretin hormones responses were assess to ascertain the effect of surgery in all groups. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT) were conducted three and seven weeks after surgery. Results: Comparing our GB-DJT to the RYGB group, we saw no differences in the mean decline in bodyweight, food intake, and blood glucose 8-weeks after surgery. GB-DJT group exhibited immediate and sustained glucose control throughout the study",

We assessed kidney function using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and cardiovascular risk using Framingham Risk Score (FRS) equation pre-operatively and at 3 and 12 months of follow-up. Our population was divided into two groups: Patients with CKD Stage \u22652 (GFR\\90 mL/min) and patients with normal GFR. significance. Results: Of the 1,330 patients reviewed, 22.48% (n=299) met the criteria for CKD-EPI Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and Framingham Risk Score (FRS) calculations. After matching, 200 patients (15.03%) were left to analyze, 70% (n=140) of which had a Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Eighty-six patients (43%) had an impaired kidney function (CKD\u22652) (Group 1) and 114 patients (57%) had a normal GFR (Group 2). Common demographics and comorbidities after matching are described in Table 1. The mean creatinine in Group 1 was 1.25\u00b11.23 mg/dL versus 0.68\u00b10.13mg/ dL in Group 2 (P\\0001). Glomerular filtration rate was 66.70\u00b120.36mL/min in Group 1 and 101",

Fourteen (16.1%) patients required readmission within 30 days postoperatively. Six patients (6.9%) required surgical interventions including 2 for gastrointestinal leak, 2 for hemodynamic instability, 1 for a cecal perforation, and 1 for a small bowel obstruction. There were no mortalities within the first year of revisional surgery. In 62 patients with BMI[35 kg/m 2 at the time of revisional surgery, at the median postoperative follow-up of 30 (interquartile range, 14-72) months, a median 6 (interquartile range, 2-9) kg/m 2 reduction in BMI was observed. Overall, 19 (21.8%) patients had persistent type 2 diabetes at time of revisional surgery. Improvement of diabetes was observed in 15 patients (78.9%) after conversion of SG to RYGB. Among 14 patients with GERD symptoms, subjective symptomatic relief was reported at the last follow-up. Conclusion: Weight recidivism is the most common indication for revision of SG",

Average age and preoperative BMI were 45.8 (10.9) years and 44.8 (8.2) kg/m 2 , respectively. Preoperative comorbidities included: diabetes (20.6%), hypertension (46.3%), hyperlipidemia (29.4%), previous myocardial infarction (1.9%), obstructive sleep apnea (30.0%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.5%), gastroesophageal reflux (30.0%), tobacco use (8.8%). The ASA classes of patients undergoing SG were II (14.4%), III (84.4%), and IV (1.3%). The follow up rate at 6, 12 and 24 months was 86.9%, 44.4%, and 18.8%, respectively. The 30-day mortality and readmission rate were 0% and 4.4%, respectively. The %EWL was not different among age groups at 6, 12 or 24 months for the total, male, or female cohorts. Among preoperative BMI groups, %EWL was not different in any cohort at 12 or 24 months, but was different at 6 months for the total cohort (p\\0.001) and female cohort (p\\ 0.001), and trended toward significance in the male cohort (p=0.051). The highest %EWL was found to be in patients with preoperative BMI of 35-40. There was no difference in 30-day mortality or readmissions among groups",

Patients were followed for 2-years with primary end points consisting of total weight loss (TWL), percent excess body weight loss (%EBW) and impact on DM as measured by fasting blood glucose (FBS) and HbA1c. In addition, baseline, 1 week, and 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-operative levels of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), leptin, and ghrelin were collected. Results: A total of 25/26 patients completed follow-up. The %EBW at 1 year for LRYGB and LSG were 54% and 49%, respectively. Resolution of DM occurred in 22/25 patients, the remaining three subjects were in the LGS arm. Pre-operative FBS in LRGYB and LSG groups, were 127 and 131, respectively. Pre-operative HbA1c in the LRYGB and LSG groups, were 7.06 and 7.15, respectively. FBS at 1 year for LRYGB and LSG were 93 and 110, while HbA1c for LRYGB and LSG were 5.89 and 6.54, respectively. A consistent post-operative decrease in FBS was only seen in LRYGB. LRYGB ghrelin percentages increased at 6, 12, and 18 months, while levels decreased in LSG. Leptin percentages decreased in both groups. The PPY levels remained relatively unchanged in both groups. LRYGB GLP-1 levels increased at 1 week, 6, 12, and 18 months. LSG GLP-1 trends were similar except at 18 months where GLP-1 levels decreased. Conclusion: LRYGB and LSG resulted in equivalent post-surgical weight loss and resolution of DM in the NH population",

Laser-based ablation (LA) techniques, are limited by the lack of depth penetration control and thermal damage (TD) prediction. Our aim was to evaluate a predictive numerical modelling (PNM) of the TD to preoperatively select the optimal power and exposure time enabling a controlled ablation down to the submucosa (SM). Additionally, the ability of confocal endomicroscopy (CE) to provide information on the TD was assessed",

Results: The comparison between OTG/OPG-IP shows no significant difference in perioperative complications and QOL scores, significant smaller body weight loss in OPG-IP group. LPG-IP group also shows good result in short term outcomes. Consideration: As comparison in open surgery implies superiority in jejunal interposition, we have introduced LPG-IP. Esophagogastrostomy after proximal gastrectomy is simple but has a risk for sever GERD symptoms, no optimal procedure for reconstruction after proximal gastrectomy has yet been established. Although laparoscopic jejunal interposition is relatively complicated in procedure, we can safely perform in combination with common anastomosis techniques.

The inclusion criteria in this study were (i) pathologic proven stage I-II gastric cancer (ii) no other malignancy (iii) more than D1 lymph node dissection (iv) R0 surgery. One-to-two propensity score matching was performed to compensate for the differences between two groups. Results: After the propensity score matching, solo SPDG (n=99) and MLDG (n=198) patients were selected. Mean operation time (120\u00b135.3 vs 178\u00b153.4 mins, p=0.001) and estimated blood loss (EBL) (24.6\u00b147.4 vs 46.7\u00b166.5 ml, p=0.001) were significantly lower in the solo SPDG group than in the MLDG group. The hospital stay and the use of pain control were similar between the two groups. Although the initiation of semi fluid diet was similar, the time to first flatus was earlier in the solo SPDG",

Results: Forty-six out of 555 (8%) patients referred for GP required JT insertion to treat malnutrition. Etiology of GP included: 67% Idiopathic, 22% Diabetic, 11% Post-surgical. Thirty-six patients (78%) reported severe daily symptoms. Twenty-five patients (55%) had successful return to oral intake while 21 (45%) required prolonged feeding access, reinsertion of a JT or TPN initiation. On multivariate analysis patients who had a pyloroplasty (p=0.003, OR 6.6) and those who were married (p=0.043, OR 3.8) were found to be independent predictors of successful discontinuation of tube feedings. On subgroup analysis 4-hour gastric emptying time normalized after pyloroplasty (p= 0.008) in patients which had a successful re-initiation of oral intake while persistent gastric emptying refractory to pyloroplasty was associated with failure. The group of patients who underwent pyloroplasty did not differ in terms of demographics, marital status (p=0.192) and preoperative gastric emptying (p=0.492) from those who did not.

One patient did not have any immunosuppression due to HIV infection, whereas the other were on cyclosporine, tacrolimus and/or mycophenolate mofetil. There were two laparoscopic and two open cases, mean operative time was 169.25 minutes (111-311), mean blood loss was 85 ml (20-200). Mesh used were biological porcine dermis in one case, polypropylene with absorbable hydrogel barrier in three cases. Mean mesh length and width were 27 cm (20-33) and 28.25 cm (25-33) respectively. One patient underwent a component separation, though none of the patients had the fascial defect closed. There were no intra-operative complications. Three patients were readmitted for hyperkalemia, abdominal pain, and seroma respectively. Neither recurrences nor reoperations were reported. Mean follow-up was 75.5 days (17-136) Conclusion: Post liver transplant incisional hernia repair is feasible either laparoscopic or in an open fashion. Because of the size and location of the defect, fascial closure is unlikely achievable. The use of standard techniques and materials give a similar result of the non-transplant population.

This is probably the first case report in world literature describing laparoscopic management of hydrocele-en-bissac. Case Report: A 50 year old male presented with complaints of bilateral hydrocele and swelling in right lower abdomen since one year. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an encysted hypodense lesion with enhancing walls along the right side of pelvis, anterior to the psoas muscle and extending through the internal ring into the right inguinal region upto the scrotal sac; measuring 14.1 cm93.6 cm suggestive of an encysted hydrocele of cord associated with hydrocele of both scrotal sacs",

To minimize the resection of stomach tissue, especially for lesions close to the esophagogastric junction or pyloric ring, we have developed laparoscopic wedge resection (LWR) with the serosal and muscular layers incision technique (SAMIT) for gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This SAMIT is simple and does not require special devices. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to clarify whether LWR with SAMIT for gastric GISTs is technically feasible in term of short-term outcome",

All bariatric procedures were approached laparoscopically (1814 procedures were stapled and 501 were nonstapled). The mean patient age was 38 years (16-73), females represented 85% and mean BMI was 48.2 kg/m 2 (35-73). There were no perioperative mortalities, no conversions to open surgery and no intraoperative blood transfusions. There we two major intraoperative complications (hypopharyngeal perforation-1, malignant hyperthermia-1). Mean hospital stay was 1.45 days (1-40 days). Eleven patients (0.47%, 10 in gastric bypass group and one in LSG group) required 30-day reoperations for postoperative complications (staple line gastrointestinal bleeding-5, anastomotic leak-1, strangulated port site hernia-1, unexplained severe abdominal pain-1, intestinal obstruction-2, and intraabdominal abscess-1). There were no long term (1-year) mortalities in patients that required reoperation. There was one transfer to another institution. The dynamics of further improving safety was such that there was no complication on the recent consecutive 127 stapled procedures and the mean hospital stay was 1.1 days (1-4 days). Detailed subgroup analyses will be provided. Conclusions: With well-controlled and structured pre-, intra-, and post-operative care, laparoscopic bariatric surgery can be performed with minimal reoperations and zero mortality in a teaching institution",

(LDG: elderly 71, younger 209; ODG: elderly 73, younger 86) Preoperative comorbidity and surgical results were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect predictive factors for postoperative complications. Results: In both LDG and ODG groups, the operative time and amount of blood loss did not differ, while comorbidity was more common in elderly patients than in the nonelderly, and there were fewer retrieved lymph nodes in elderly patients. The incidence of all postoperative complications did not differ between both groups in each procedure, and there were no significant differences in the time to first flatus or postoperative hospital stay. However, in terms of specific postoperative complications, respiratory complications were more frequently observed in eldery group with ODG significantly (p=0.034), while not with LDG group. In multivariable analysis, age was not independent predictor of postoperative complications. Conclusion: ODG for eldery patients requires attention particularly in postoperative respiratory complications. LDG is a safe and less invasive treatment for gastric cancer in elderly patients who have greater comorbidity.

P757 Outcomes of Laparoscopic Antireflux Surgery for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: Effectiveness and Economic Benefits Kyung Won Seo, PhD; Kosin University College of Medicine Purpose: Laparoscopic antireflux surgery (ARS) is an alternative treatment option for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the world. However, the effectiveness and economic feasibility of ARS versus medical treatment is unknown. This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness and economic benefits of ARS. Methods: Nine patients with GERD were treated using laparoscopic ARS between 2012 and 2016. Surgical results and total cost for surgery were reviewed. Results: Seven men and 2 women were enrolled. Preoperatively, typical symptoms were present in 9 patients, while atypical symptoms were present in 5 patients. One patient underwent partial fundoplication due to absent peristalsis and the other underwent Nissen fundoplication. Postoperatively, typical symptoms were controlled in 9 of 9 patients, while atypical symptoms were controlled in 4 of 5 patients. Overall, at 6 months after surgery, 3 reported partial resolution of GERD symptoms, with 6 achieving complete control. The average cost of ARS for nine patients was 5840 USD. Conclusion: Laparoscopic ARS is effective for controlling typical and atypical GERD symptoms. The cost of ARS may be more economical over the long term compared to medical treatment",

            "title": "Towakai Hospital Introduction: Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is a standard surgical procedure for the treatment of common bile duct stones (CBDs). However, there are some problems associated with CBD drainage after operations even if performing with the primary closure. Therefore, we developed a new drainage tube, C-tube, which contributes to shorter drainage periods and reduces perioperative complications. Method: C-tube is a type of bile drainage tube which is fixed to the cystic duct with an elastic band. Closing the duct with an elastic band as soon as C-tube is removed prevents bile leakage from the stump of the cystic duct. The essential roles of this tube include: 1. Assisting suturing during operations, 2. Use during intra-and post-operative cholangiograpy, 3. Assisting post-operative endoscopic sphincterotomy when necessary",

We excluded patients having revisions, gastric banding, and patients whose primary surgeon had left during the data collection period. We analyzed demographics and follow-up rates at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Chi-square test was used to evaluate for significance, and results were corrected for multiple comparison. Results: 435 patients met inclusion criteria in the pre-intervention group, and 836 in the postintervention group. Of those, 418 were analyzed for the 2 year follow-up visit. The pre-intervention group had 62 males, 373 females, and an average age of 37. Approximately 1/3 of the surgeries performed were SG, 2/3 were RYGB. The post-intervention group had 127 males, 709 females, average age of 38. Approximately half of the post-intervention cases were SG while the rest were RYGB. Conclusion: Bariatric surgery is a useful tool in aiding weight loss and improving comorbidities. It is essential that patients receive long-term follow-up and monitoring to achieve these goals. Our program now uses a system of phone call reminders for scheduled visits, as well as calls and letters for annual visits",

We took measurements to surgeons during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Results: The mean preoperative heart rate was 77.8 bpm. The mean minimum intraoperative heart rate was 86 bpm. The mean maximum intraoperative heart rate was 115.2 bpm (86% with tachycardia at the surgery). The mean immediate postoperative heart rate was 89.5 cpm. The mean heart rate 15 minutes after the postoperative phase was 80.1 cpm. At the immediate preoperative phase 53% of surgeons had elevated BP level (usual normotensives)",

Likewise, similar disability scores were reported between the three surgical groups. Older surgeons performing laparoscopic and robotic-assisted approaches reported a higher impact of upper-limb problems interfering with their daily activities, unlike open surgeons.

Nine patients (60%) reported improvement in their symptoms and overall quality of life. Four patients (26%) reported no improvement in symptoms and required additional intervention for symptom control and supportive care (one underwent roux-en-Y gastric bypass, three underwent laparoscopic jejunostomy feeding tube placement to maintain nutrition). Conclusion: Robotic-assisted pyloroplasty is a safe option that improves symptoms and quality of life in 60% of our patients",

The locations of tumor were 26 upper rectum, 44 lower rectum. The procedure were as follow, high anterior resection in 6, low anterior resection in 51, ISR in 6, APR in 7 patients. Eight patients underwent bilateral lymph nodes dissection (LLND). The procedures were performed successfully in all cases. Mean age was 66.5 years, and 70% of the patients were men, and the mean body mass index was 22.5 (range, 18.5-29.4) kg/m 2 . Median operative duration was 321 (190-666) minutes. Median blood loss was 15 (0-270) ml. Median postoperative stay was 13 (6-16) days. Mean harvest lymph node number was 17.0 (5-37). Surgical margins were negative in all cases. There was one conversion due to bleeding during the LLND and anastomotic leakage occurred in two patients. Morbidity was 17%. There was no mortality postoperatively in this series. Conclusion: In early series of the selected patients, this technique appears to be fesible and safe when performed by surgeons skilled in laparoscopic colorectal surgery",

The bowel tissue at the site of temperature change was immediately resected and examined histologically for tissue injury. Student t-tests were used for all comparisons with a p-value less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: Comparison of the laparoscopic and robotic techniques are displayed in Table 1. Energy transfer was quantified using energy leak (per mA), which in these tests averaged 1.18 degree Celsius change (95% CI 1.05-1.31) at the inactive electrode. Surface temperature heated to a maximum of 5.5 degrees Celsius, more in the robotic system than laparoscopy but still clinically negligible. Pathology results from in vivo testing showed only thermal injury to the serosa without deeper mural injury. Conclusions: Stray energy transfer occurs in both laparoscopic and robotic surgery in amounts that are measurable but without clinical relevance. The average change in tissue temperature is less than 2 degrees Celsius laparoscopically and less than 6 degrees robotically. While the robotic surgery appears to transfer more stray energy, no significant bowel injuries were caused in either group.

Surgical outcomes were compared relative to our historic values; we assessed procedure time and operating room efficiency, including set up and turn-over times. Results: Overall, the 3D/FlexDex system permitted a greater improvement in working speed, superior optical visualization, and better suture handling compared to standard laparoscopy. All surgeries were completed without any complications. Historically, we considered laparoscopic suturing to be complicated and inefficient. We relied on tacking devices for mesh fixation, suturing was previously completed with large cumbersome straight laparascopic devices. However, with FlexDex and ENDOEYE FLEX 3D, tacking devices have been eliminated and suturing technique improved. The mean total procedure times remained comparable for inguinal and hiatal hernia surgeries, and slightly longer for ventral hernias. Operating room efficiency, including mean set up and turn-over times also remained unchanged. The acquisition cost for both the Olympus ENDOEYE FLEX 3D laparoscopic imaging system",

The total reimbursements were $21,587 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $18,310 for robot assisted. This translated to an average contribution margin of $14,564 for laparoscopic vs $6,630 for robot assisted. We analyzed these differences for bypasses as well. Laparoscopic bypasses averaged 193 minutes laparoscopically vs 330 robotically. We found an average cost of laparoscopic $11,366 vs robot assisted $17,032, with a contribution margin of $13,734 laparoscopic vs $5,701 robot assisted. Conclusions: In our study we noted increased operative times with robot assisted operations, especially bypasses which could be explained by increased use of the robotic system for difficult cases such as revisional bypasses. The impact of cost is especially important in this financial climate, and judicious use of resources becomes important when determining surgical approach",

Of note, one LIH was converted to open, whereas none of the RIH required conversion. Average LOS was 9.16 hours for RIH compared to 11.6 hours for LIH. Postoperative pain at one week follow up was the same between both groups. Two postoperative surgical site occurrences (SSO) occurred in the LIH group (2 groin seromas), whereas no SSOs occurred in the RIH group. Eleven ventral hernia repairs were examined, 7 were robotic (RVH) and 4 were laparoscopic (LVH). Average OR time for RVH was 132 minutes compared to 65 minutes for LVH. Average intraoperative cost for RVH was $1,492 compared to LVH which was $1,264. No procedure from either group required conversion to open. Average LOS was 9.86 hours for RVH, and 13.5 hours for LVH. Again, postoperative pain was the same at one week follow up for both groups. There were no postoperative complications noted in either cohort. Conclusion: Operative time and procedural costs for RVH and RIH repairs were shown to be longer and more expensive when compared to their laparoscopic counterparts. However, with increased operative experience using the robotic platform, surgical time did show a decreasing trend",

For the subsequent 6 patients (the second-stage group), the procedure was performed by our hospital staff alone. In this report, we describe our experience of introduction of robotassisted colectomy and discuss issues for the future. Patients and Methods: The operative procedure was sigmoid colectomy, low anterior resection, and intersphincteric resection. The median number of lymph nodes dissected was 15.6. The mean operating time was 337 minutes for the first-stage group and 365 minutes for the second-stage group. The median console time was 206 minutes for the first-stage group and 193 minutes for the second-stage group, with no significant differences between the two groups. The mean operating time other than console time was 127 minutes for the first-stage group and 171 minutes for the second-stage group, significantly longer in the latter group. The mean amount of hemorrhage was 15.5 g in the first-stage group and 31 g in the second-stage group. No significant differences were found between the two groups in the mean length of postoperative hospital stay. None of the patients in either group developed a complication of Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher. Conclusions: The use of Dual Console system was particularly useful for the introduction of robotassisted surgery in our hospital. For the patients whom we treated, we found almost no difference in console time between the first-and second-stage groups. The high-quality instruction received via the dual console was considered to have had a beneficial effect on the operators' learning curve. However, the operations that were set up other than console time, such as roll-in and docking, took significantly longer in the second-stage group when the proctor was not present",

Results: 19 patients (7 females) were included. Median age was 28. Median BMI was 23, median ASA score was 2. Total and completion RRP-IPAA were performed for 9 and 10 patients respectively. The indications were as follows: medical refractory UC (n=12), cancer/dysplasia (n= 2), fulminant colitis (n=2), toxic megacolon (n=1), medical treatment resulting in growth retardation (n=1), medical treatment refractory bleeding (n=1). 1 patient with toxic megacolon had an emergent operation. The median docking number was 1 and 3 for completion and total RRP-IPAA respectively. Median operative time was 330 minutes. Median blood loss was 100 ml. All patients had a stapled ileal J pouch anal anastomosis. All patients had a diverting loop ileostomy at the time of IPAA creation. No intraoperative complications were observed. No conversion to open surgery was needed. The median time to flatus was 1 day. The median time to oral intake was 1 day. 1 patient had a laparotomy on postoperative day 12 due to intra-abdominal bleeding. 1 patient had a bleeding from ileostomy which was treated endoscopically. Superficial surgical site infection was observed in 3 patients. 1 patient had a pouchitis managed with oral antibiotics. 1 patient had an ileus responded to conservative treatment. 1 patient had a per-anal bleeding stopped spontaneously. 1 patient had a urinary tract infection responded to antibiotics. 2 patients had pouchitis, 1 patient had a perianal fistula requiring a loop ileostomy and a parastomal hernia was developed in another patient in long term follow up",

While medical management is considered first-line treatment, approximately 70% of patients with Crohn's disease require surgery within 10 years of their initial diagnosis. Traditionally, surgery has been performed via an open approach with poor adoption of minimally invasive technique. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of robotic-assisted approach as a minimally invasive option for surgical management of Crohn's disease and compare the perioperative outcomes with traditional laparotomy. Methods: Patients who underwent elective resection of the intestine for Crohn's disease by roboticassisted or laparotomy approach from 2011 to Q3 2015 were identified using ICD-9 codes from Premier Healthcare Database. All the procedures were performed by either general surgeons or colorectal surgeons. Since hospital characteristics were comparable between the two cohorts before propensity-score matching, 1:1 matching was performed using patient characteristics such as age, gender, race, Charlson index score and year of the surgery to create comparable cohorts. Sample selection and creation of analytic variables were performed using Instant Health Data (IHD) platform (BHE",

Patient background, characteristics, and perioperative outcomes were compared between these groups. Procedure: We chose the devices according to phases of liver transection. A soft-coagulation monopolar device was used for marking surface. An ultrasonically activated device was used for transection of the liver surface within a 2-cm depth. Crash and sealing with BiClamp were indicated for deep-phase transection. The Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator was used if the lesion was close to the major Glisson's sheath or the major hepatic vein. Results: No significant differences in the patients' background were found between the two groups. The operative durations were 128 min (60-312 min) and 203 min (50-470 min) in the AS and BS groups, respectively, with a significant difference (p\\0.001). The blood loss volumes were 5 cc (0-150 cc) and 30 cc (0-850 cc), respectively (p=0.0548).

It is essential to accurately identify the lymph node dissection range. The distribution of lymph node metastasis was assessed from laparoscopic splenic flexure colon cancer resection at our hospital. Materials: Harvested lymph nodes by laparoscopic splenic flexure colon cancer resection in which both the middle colonic artery (MCA) and left colic artery (LCA) were dissected, were examined in this study. Results: There were 52 (29 males and 23 females) splenic flexure colon cancer resection from January 2012 to August 2017. The patients number of depth of invasion was; T1: 10, T2: 6, T3: 25, T4a: 10, T4b: 1, and those of pathological stage was; I: 14, IIA: 14, IIB: 2, IIC: 1, IIIA: 4, IIIB: 10, IIIC: 2, IV: 6. The lymph node metastasis was positive in 22/52 patients (42.3%), grades were; N1a: 10, N1b: 8, N2a: 3, N2b: 1. There were 14 patients of transverse colon cancer and 8 patients of descending colon cancer. The dominant vessels of transverse colon cancer were MCA: 8 patients, LCA: 3 patients, and accessory middle colon artery (acce.MCA): 3 patients. Despite transverse colon cancer, lymph node metastasis of the LCA region was observed in 4/14 patients (28.6%). The dominant vessels of descending colon cancer were LCA: 7 patients, acce.MCA: 1 patient. Despite descending colon cancer, lymph node metastasis of the MCA region was observed in 2/8 patients (25%).",

Surgical procedures included laparoscopic or open partial colectomy, ileostomy reversal, low abdominal resection, and abdominoperineal resection. Patients averaged 5483 steps (range 1349-9698) at preoperative baseline and 1015 steps (range 27-3090) in the first two postoperative days. The median number of postoperative days until resolution of ileus was 4 (range 2-6). Resolution of ileus after surgery was significantly correlated with both preoperative and postoperative steps on multiple linear regression. An increase of 1000 steps daily preoperatively was associated with a 0.44 day decrease in duration of ileus (p\\0.001); similarly an increase of 1000 steps daily in the early postoperative period was associated with a decrease of 0.76 days (p\\0.001). This multivariate regression produced an R 2 value of 0.80 as compared to values of 0.55 and 0.39 on univariate regression of preoperative and postoperative steps, respectively. Conclusions: Both preoperative and postoperative activity, as measured by daily steps, correlated with earlier resolution of ileus in patients undergoing intestinal surgery. The effect of early postoperative steps remained significant even when controlling for preoperative activity in a multivariate analysis. These findings support the common practice of encouraging early ambulation after surgery to hasten discharge.P365 Laparoscopic Assisted Nerve Block in Treatment of Inguinodynia Trenton Kinnear, MD, Lauren Grimsley, MD, Brandie Forman, Nikita Shokur, Vince Vetrano, Bruce Ramshaw, MD; UT Medical Center Knoxville Background: Traditional methods of clinical research may not be adequate to improve the value of care for patients with complex medical problems such as chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair. This problem is very complex with many potential factors contributing to the development of this complication. Methods: We have implemented a clinical quality improvement (CQI) effort in an attempt to better measure and improve outcomes for patients suffering with chronic groin pain (inguinodynia) after inguinal hernia repair. Between April 2011-January 2017, 104 patients underwent 105 operations in an attempt to relieve pain. Patients who had prior laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair had their procedure completed either laparoscopically with mesh removal and neurolysis or a combination of a laparoscopic and open procedure (mesh removal, neurectomy and primary reconstruction of the groin) in an attempt to relieve pain. Some patients received an intraoperative block laparoscopically while another group of patients received an intraoperative block via an open procedure. This evaluation of outcomes was intended to investigate whether there are differences in outcomes depending on whether the patient received a laparoscopic or an open nerve block. Results: Fifty-nine patients received an intraoperative block for inguinodynia. Of those fifty-nine patients, twenty-three patients had intraoperative blocks laparoscopically and thirty-six patients had an open intraoperative nerve block. Of those twenty-three laparoscopic patients, 43% (10 of 23) had no pain immediately after surgery while 41% (15 of 36) of the open patients had no pain after surgery. The average OR time for the open procedure was 124 minutes while the laparoscopic procedure was 120 minutes averaged. The average post anesthesia care unit time for the open group of patients was 68 minutes while the laparoscopic group of patients had an average time of 51 minutes in the PACU. For the laparoscopic group of patients, 91% (21 of 23) patients were discharged the same day as their procedure. For the open group of patients, 72% (26 of 36) patients were discharged the same day as their procedure.",

We report here our recent laparoscopic procedure of esophagogastrostomy after limited proximal gastrectomy (LPG) for the treatment of upper third early gastric cancer. Methods and Procedures: Key points of our procedure are as follows; 1) Preservation of hepatic and pyloric branches of vagal nerve, 2) Preservation of intra-abdominal esophagus as much as possible, 3) End-to-side esophago-gastrostomy on the anterior wall, 2 cm from the lesser curvature and 3 cm from the top of the remnant stomach, using he circular stapler, 4) Seromuscular anchoring suture between the intra-abdominal stomach and the top of the remnant stomach, 5) Anchoring of the remnant stomach to the right crus of diaphragm. We evaluated postoperative clinical results of the patients after LPG. Results: Our procedure technique preserved peristalsis of the entire length of the esophagus and lower third of the stomach, and allowed the greater curvature near the top of the stomach to function as a new fundus. Lumen of the lower esophagus was closed under normal condition and relaxed after swallowing. There was neither anastomotic leakage nor abdominal abscess. There was little reflux esophagitis on endoscopic examination. Postoperative change of hemoglobin levels and body weights were significantly less in the proximal gastrectomy group than in the total gastrectomy group. Conclusions: Our procedure is a simple and easy technique, and may be a better choice for early gastric cancer in the upper-third stomach than laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.P414 Surgical Outcomes of Circular-Stapled and Linear-Stapled Esophagojejunostomy in Gastric Cancer: A Propensity-Matched Analysis So Hyun Kang, Dr, Jan Bueno, Dr, Sa-Hong Min, Dr, Yoontaek Lee, Dr, Ki Bum Park, Dr, Young Suk Park, Prof, Sang-Hoon Ahn, Prof, Do Joong Park, Prof, Hyung-Ho Kim, Prof; Seoul National University Bundang Hospital",

Conclusions: LS might be beneficial to thoracoscopic esophagectomy in prone position in terms of thermal spread from energy device. Appropriate temporal and spatial distance from electrosurgical devises to important mediastinal structure, such as recurrent laryngeal nerve and tracheobronchial membrane, was required for avoiding postoperative complications.P511 3D vs 2D Laparoscopic Surgery: Comparative Assessment Sergio Rojas, MD, Emina Pasic, MD, Raul Ameneyro, MD, Anuar F Simon, Cris Gomez; Hospital Angeles Puebla",

Different variables were identified as risk factors for this complicatio in cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of post-splenectomy portal venous thrombosis in cirrhotic patients.Patients and Methods: Sixty cirrhotic patients of Child class A submitted to open splenectomy for various indications at my institution during the period from March 2008 to March 2016 were observed, both clinically and by Duplex ultrasound examination for the development of postsplenectomy portal venous thrombosis. Results: Overall, 17 patients (28.3%) developed post-splenectomy portal venous thrombosis at a median interval of 4.5 days (21 hours to 7 days) post-splenectomy. Univariate analysis showed that lower preoperative platelet count (P\\0.0460), lower preoperative white blood cell count (P\\ 0.0001) and wider splenic vein diameter (P\\0.0001) correlated with post-splenectomy portal venous thrombosis. Multivariate analysis identified lower preoperative white blood cell count [odds ratio (OR): 0.651, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.245-0.893, P\\0.005] and wider splenic vein diameter (OR: 2.383, 95% CI: 1.558-3.646., P\\0.001) as independent risk factors of postsplenectomy portal venous thrombosis. While 16 out of the 17 patients (94%) who had these 2 risk factors developed portal venous thrombosis, only 1 out of the 43 patients (2.3%) who didn't have the same risk factors developed portal venous thrombosis. All 17 patients had complete resolution of their thrombosis on anticoagulation therapy within 3-6 months without complications or mortality.Conclusion: Portal venous thrombosis is a common complication of splenectomy in cirrhotic patients. Patients with low white blood cell count count and wide splenic vein diameter are highly susceptible to develop this complication mandating close observation from the 1st postoperative day and immediate anticoagulation after diagnosis.",

Introduction: Magnetic Surgery is a recently developed technique assisting in the completion of laparoscopic procedures with reduced number of incisions, therefore providing the potential benefits of even less invasive interventions in terms of postoperative pain, complications, and cosmetic results. Patient perceptions are very important for the clinical practice, as patient involvement in healthcare choices has grown exponentially, especially in terms of elective procedures such as bariatric surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the perception of surgery-related factors and a new surgical technique in a bariatric surgery population. Methods: A video-animation and a 22-item anonymous survey were given to the new patients of an academic medical center. The video described in non-medical terms the number and location of incisions used to perform open surgery, conventional laparoscopy, and Magnetic Surgery through a single incision approach. The survey included demographics and questions about the importance of surgery-related factors rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Similarly, patients were asked to compare Magnetic Surgery with conventional laparoscopy and to mark their responses regarding postoperative factors. This cross-sectional study was analyzed using descriptive statistics.",

Bariatric surgery produces significant sustained weight loss and hypertension resolution likely through multiple mechanisms which includes beneficial changes in the gut microbiome. We hypothesized that the type of prophylactic antibiotic given for bariatric surgery could impact the resolution rate of hypertension by altering the post-operative gastrointestinal microflora. Methods: A retrospective analysis of adult bariatric patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between 2012 and 2016 was conducted. Patients were identified through the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database. The standard antibiotic prophylaxis was cefazolin, or clindamycin in patients with a penicillin allergy. Univariate analyses were performed comparing the differing perioperative antibiotic treatments with resolution of hypertension at 2-week (\u00b11 week), 6-week (\u00b12 weeks), 3-month (\u00b12 weeks), 6-month (\u00b16 weeks), and 1-year (\u00b12 months) follow up appointments.

The readmission rate within 30 days was the same in both groups, 0.03.Conclusion: Our retrospective study results support the initial hypothesis that IDP and postoperative UGIS do not alter outcomes in bariatric surgery. Moreover, we found that stopping routine use of IDP and UGIS significantly reduced LOS while complication rates remained low. Therefore, we do not recommend routine use of IDP and UGIS in the uncomplicated bariatric patient. Obesity and dyslipidemias are well-known factors that affect the overall cardiovascular risk. Bariatric surgery has shown to have a positive impact on the overall lipid profiles. However, most of the studies are based on Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and only a few analyze the outcomes after Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG). Our goal is to determine the overall impact of bariatric surgery, especially LSG, in the lipid profile.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search of MIBP from 2011 to 2016 was performed by querying multiple electronic databases regardless of language of origin. All diagnoses and procedures relating primary to the biliary system were included. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and related procedures were excluded from the search due to its universal application. Postoperative outcomes were assessed. Historical controls for open complex biliary procedures were used for comparison. Very few reports and a paucity of data exist documenting outcomes from complex MIBP. The limited data suggest that complex MIBP can be performed safely and effectively, yet universal adoption is not apparent based on the total number of patients in the literature. Further series are needed to more accurately compare outcomes.Yun Kyung Jung, Dongho Choi, Hwon Kyum Park, Kyeong Geun Lee; College of Medicine, Hanyang University Introduction: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been widely performed for the treatment of gallbladder disease. However, it has potential fatal complications like bile duct injury which are correlated with inexperience. Therefore, surgical training for safe and exact LC technique is important for surgical residents. The aim of this study is to investigate the personal learning curve of one resident and confirm the safety of LC performed by surgical residents. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 151 patients who underwent LC by one surgical resident at the Hanyang University Hospital. Three or four trocars were inserted and we established the \"critical view of safety\" in all patients. All procedures were supervised by an experienced HBP surgeon. LC performed by surgical residents is safe although they operated with longer operative time. However, inexperience surgeons must always keep in mind confirmation of CVS and basic laparoscopic surgery technique during LC. These principles should be trained by attending staff for learning curve period.",

This variation makes operator hard to perform cholecystectomy. Despite it is important to apprehend the detailed anatomy of bile duct and GB and understand how to approach LSGB in advance cholecystectomy, we usually encounter difficulties with this unusual situation just after begining operation. We herein report surgical process of LSGB with video in this manuscript. Patients: The patient was following up with gallstones about ten years and occasionally complained of the pain migrating from Left upper quadrant to epigastric area. LSGB was encountered after begining laparoscope approach. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done antegrade method not to injure anomalous bile duct. Results: To prevent the injury to anomalous bile duct, we began to carefully separate GB from its fundus first, prior to cystic duct ligation. Cholecystectomy was successfully done after complete detachment of GB from liver bed. Postoperative lab findings and patient's condition showed little possibility of injury on surgical site. Patient was discharged two days after surgery. Conclusion: When surgeon encounter LSGB without diagnosis prior to operation, Antegrade dissection of GB enables surgeons to detect Calot's triangle easily and to complete operation safely. For unpredictable but possible anomalous GB, surgeon should always give a thought to suitably modified cholecystectomy.Introduction: Klatskin tumors (KT) occur at the confluence of right and left extrahepatic ducts and classified based on their anatomical and histological code in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). The second edition of ICD-O (ICD-O-2) allocated a distinctive histological code to KT, which was cross-referenced to the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. This unclear coding may result in ambiguous reporting of the demographical and clinical features of KT. The current study aims to investigate the demographic, clinical and pathological factors impacting prognosis and survival of KT in the light of updated third edition of ICD-O (ICD-O-3).Methods: Data on 1,144 KT patients from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) database (2001-2012) was abstracted. KT patients were analyzed for age, gender, race, stage, treatment, and long-term survival. The data was analyzed using Chi-square tests, T-tests, univariate and multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare long-term survival between KT and sub-groups of all biliary cholangiocarcinomas (CC).Conclusion: ICD-O-3 has permitted greater understanding of Klatskin tumors. This is a rare and lethal biliary malignancy that presents most often in Caucasian males in their seventh decade of life with moderately differentiated histology. Surgical resection does not provide any survival advantage compared to similarly treated biliary CC. Also, the combination of surgery and radiation appeared to provide no added survival benefits compared to other treatment modalities for KT.Hamdy Abdallah, PhD; Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, EgyptBackground: When the critical view of safety can't be obtained during dissection of Calot's triangle in difficult gallbladder, conversion to open surgery is recommended to prevent bile duct injury. Several \"damage control\" techniques, such as cholecystostomy and subtotal cholecystectomy (SC), aim to decrease the conversion rate and risks of bile duct injury.Introduction: Subtotal cholecystectomy (SC) is a standard operation utilized to prevent bile duct injury (BDI) when the Critical View of Safety cannot be safely achieved when encountering the difficult gallbladder. Although SC remains safe, the long-term implications, such as quality of life and need for further intervention, are less well known. Methods and Procedures: All patients who underwent cholecystectomy at our institution since 2011 were identified in a retrospectively collected, IRB-approved database. Operative notes where carefully reviewed to identify all cases of SC, along with the appropriate subtype grouping (fenestrating or reconstituting). SC patients where matched to contemporary cases of total cholecystectomy (TC) based upon age, sex, and procedure method (open or laparoscopic). Patient charts were carefully reviewed for perioperative and long-term outcomes, including re-interventions and additional surgical procedures. The patients were subsequently contacted via telephone and asked to complete SF-36 and GIQOL surveys. Results: Sixty-three cases (2.6%) of SC where identified out of 2418 cases (15 fenestrating, 48 reconstituting). Thirty (48%) cases were completed laparoscopically. Demographics of the two matched cohorts are presented inTable 1. Five SC patients required re-operative completion cholecystectomy for recurrent biliary disease. No TC patients required reoperation, however 2 major BDI occurred in this group (3%), versus no major BDI in the SC group. Quality of life surveys were completed in 21 (33%) SC and 23 (37%) TC patients. SF-36 and GIQOL scores are non-significant between groups with the exception of one sub-category \"role limitations due to physical health,\" which was improved in the SC group.Conclusions: In our series, long-term QOL scores do not differ between patients undergoing SC and TC. SC may be protective of major BDI; however it clearly comes with an increased risk for the need for re-operative procedures. SC should be considered in difficult operative scenarios, however, patients should be followed for recurrent biliary disease and need for re-operative management.Introduction:The study was conducted to compare the efficacy of intraperitoneal instillation of Ropivacaine versus Bupivacaine for post operative pain relief after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to compare the analgesic requirement and overall morbidity in patients with either of two interventions.

Many patients receive diagnostic ultrasound imaging prior to presentation but are not operated on immediately.Methods: This is a retrospective study analyzing all of the laparoscopic cholecystectomies per-Conclusions: We found that receiving prior ultrasound in patients who presented acutely appears to have no statistically or clinically significant effect on OR time, complication rates, LOS, and 30 day readmission rates when compared to patients who presented for LC electively. However, there was a statistically and clinically significant increase in OR time and LOS in acute vs. elective cases in general. Thus, it is possible that having prior symptomatic disease, as indicated by prior ultrasound testing, appears to confer a protective advantage to this group. Larger prospective studies evaluating the effect of prior symptomatic disease on operative findings, complication rates, LOS and 30 day readmission rates when patients present acutely and undergo LC are needed to analyze these effects further.",

            "text": "Patients Prioritize Safety First: Opinions of Transfer of Care for Unexpected Findings Versus Bile Duct Injury in Laparoscopic CholecystectomyIntroduction: Surgeons often assume patients may be dissatisfied if their operation were stopped due to suspicious intraoperative findings or injury requiring transfer of care. Knowledge of patient centered opinions may help clarify how patients feel when these situations arise to support patient safety. We sought to assess patient opinions regarding transfer of care for unexpected intraoperative findings during laparoscopic cholecystectomy with and without bile duct injury, and whether these perceptions may differ. Methods and Procedures: The investigators developed two clinical scenarios comparing transfer of care for unexpected intraoperative findings during elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (without bile duct injury and with injury requiring open repair). A multi-institutional structured telephone interview process was conducted with patients\u226518 years of age who had an outpatient, uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy within the last year. The first scenario presented a case of suspicious findings prompting the surgeon to stop and transfer for specialized care; whereas, the second case was a bile duct injury requiring transfer of care. Textual and thematic analysis, as well as descriptive statistics, were used to analyze our interview results. Results: Forty-five patients were contacted and completed the survey. Satisfaction with transfer of care for unexpected intraoperative findings without bile duct injury was 69% and over 95% of respondents were satisfied their surgeon stopped the procedure to initiate transfer due to safety concerns; 64% of patients would return to that surgeon for post operative care and 78% would see that surgeon for another operation in the future. In the scenario with bile duct injury requiring open repair, 86% were satisfied with their surgeon's decision to stop the operation, 91% of patients were satisfied with transfer of care, and 32% would see their first surgeon again in the future. Themes of prioritizing safety, providing explanations, appreciation for admission of error and setting aside ego were frequently cited in both scenarios. Conclusions: Patients prioritize safety and are highly satisfied with halting a procedure to facilitate transfer of care for suspicious intraoperative findings during routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The majority would return to that surgeon for surgical care. Past history includes middle segmentectomy of left lung in 1964, post-operation pathology implied tuberculosis.

With regards to small intestine disorders, the usual culprits are hernias, adhesions, stenosis, and intussusception. We describe a rare case of a patient with ulcerative roux limb jejunitis. Case Description: A 48 year old female with asthma, diabetes mellitus, fibromyalgia, hypertension and roux-en-y gastric bypass in 2005 for weight loss presented to our hospital with one week history of abdominal pain, vomiting and poor oral intake. At that time, she reported one episode of dark colored stool with admission hemoglobin of 8.2 with known chronic iron deficient anemia. She endorsed recent heavy NSAID use to control her fibromyalgia discomfort. Patient was not on home proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers after her gastric bypass. Inpatient upper endoscopy showed erosive pouchitis and moderately severe jejunitis thirty centimeters from the gastrojejunal anastomosis in the mid-jejunal roux limb. Biopsies taken at that time demonstrated acute ulceration of jejunum and patchy/non-specific gastritis. Patient was recommended to discontinue NSAID use and begin twice daily proton pump inhibitor treatment. Helicobacter pylori testing was negative during admission. Hemoglobin remained stable. Discussion: Roux-en-y gastric bypass is associated with risk of several postoperative complications including malnutrition, GERD, internal hernia, anastomotic leak and marginal ulceration. There are several hypothesized causes of marginal ulceration post-RYGB including pouch size, orientation, staple line integrity, mucosal ischemia secondary to tension, NSAIDs, helicobacter pylori and smoking. Although several sources site jejunitis in post-RYGB patients, there are minimal reports of ulcerations thirty centimeters distal to the gastrojejunal anastomosis in the roux limb. Our patient's ulcer was attributed to her heavy NSAID use for fibromyalgia.Although not yet a standard of care, it is not an uncommon practice for patients to be placed on long-term acid-suppression therapy with proton-pump inhibitors to mitigate this risk. Our patient was not on long term PPI use at time of her jejunal limb ulcer diagnosis. Conclusion: Marginal ulcers at the gastrojejunal anastomoses are well known post-operative complication of RYGB as well as asymptomatic jejunitis of the roux-limb. Patients with increased risk factors including heavy NSAID use and smoking are also at risk for jejunal ulceration up to 30 centimeters from the GJ anastomosis as demonstrated by our patient case. Long-term PPI suppression therapy for post-RYGB patients should be considered in those at high risk for ulcers.",

Discussion: There are few instances of adrenal gland abscess reported in the literature. Our patient has a recent surgical history of multiple percutaneous aspiration and indwelling catheter drainages for a symptomatic benign adrenal cyst. Her uncontrolled diabetes and noncompliance with instructions for drain care likely contributed to her development of a refractory adrenal abscess. This case highlights the importance of prudent decision making with regards to electing to drain adrenal gland pathology, as well as vigilant management of indwelling catheters.Introduction: Leiomyosarcoma of the duodenum is a rare disease it can occurs in both sexes with approximately the same frequency. Peak incidence is in the 40 to 49 year age. Leiomyosarcoma is relatively infrequent compared to adenocarcinoma of the duodenum. It may develop from all parts of the gastrointestinal tract. The duodenal localisation is rare. Clinical latency makes the diagnosis often at an advance stage stage. The most effective surgical therapy has been radical local excision of the tumor. Extensive removal of regional lymphatics would not seem to be a fruitful pursuit, since nodal metastases are rare. Since the techniques of pancreatic and duodenal surgery have been refined, excisional therapy has been possible with a low mortality. Aggressive surgical therapy is indicated both for relief of symptoms and because of the definite chance for cure in some cases.",

Case Presentation: 69 yo M with BPH, COPD, and HTN who presented with a four day history of abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation and obstipation. He had never had any abdominal surgeries. CT demonstrated dilated loops of small bowel a transition point in the mid abdomen and submucosal fat deposition in the distal small bowel and cecum and calcified right mesenteric lymph nodes. Creatinine was 1.8, WBC 17,000, and stable vital signs. During exploratory laparotomy a loop of ileum had wrapped itself around an infarcted wall of the cecum (non-circumferential). On closer inspection of the small bowel, a small nodule and tethering of the mesentery were noted 35 cm from the ileocecal valve. An ileocecectomy was performed.Pathology revealed transmural gangrenous necrosis of the cecum. A 1.7 cm well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor was found in the resected ileum. Six of sixteen lymph nodes showed metastatic neuroendocrine tumor cells. Surgical margins were clear from malignant cells. The tumor was considered well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with a Ki-67 index of \\3%. Biochemical testing were significant for a 5 HIAA level of 5.2, Chromogranin A of 125 and a Serotonin level of 340.",

            "text": "Introduction: Internal hernias account for a small percentage of small bowel obstruction, and the condition involves herniation of a viscus through a normal o abnormal opening within the peritoneal cavity. Paraduodenal hernias account for more than 50% of the cases. Other less common causes include transmesenteric, transomental, foramen of Winslow and paracecal hernias. Only surgical findings can confirm the diagnosis and offer adequate treatment. Here we report two unusual cases of small bowel herniation through a defect in the Falciform ligament in an male and an woman 75 and 49 years old, and a case an male 65-years-old with herniation bowel trought triangular ligament without surgical history abdominal. Discussion: The falciform ligament separates the left lateral and left medial segments along the umbilical fissure and anchors the liver to the anterior abdominal wall. The non-peritonealization of this ligament, which may be better understood as the failure of the two layers of peritoneum to fuse around the umbilical vein and to the abdominal wall leads to a defect between the round ligament and the anterior wall, configurating an abnormal opening through which any viscous could potentially herniate. We present a very unusual cases of right upper abdominal pain due to the presence of an internal hernia through the falciform and triangular ligament in a patients without surgical history and otherwise healthy. Upon arrival, clinical findings did not suggest small bowel obstruction in the absence of nausea, vomiting or abdominal distention. Instead, biliary origin of symptoms was suspected. Ultrasonography only showed severely distended bowel loops and free liquid in right subphrenic space. It was abdominal CT scan findings and the persistence of symptoms what made us take the patients to the operating room.",

It has been suggested that increased calcium levels due to hyperparathyroidism can lead to gastric acid hypersecretion and therefore PUD. Peptic ulcer perforation as the first manifestation of PHPT is rare and to our knowledge the first reported case caused by giant parathyroid adenoma.

To help meet this need, in 2010 the American Hospital Association recommended not only improving workflow and staff retention, but attracting a new generation of healthcare workers. With this impetus, our group developed a multidisciplinary program to broadcast live operations to high school students starting in 2008. We are currently in our 10th year of the curriculum. Methods: An educational grant from Highmark BlueShield supported technical upgrades to allow streaming of live procedures to a remote studio audience at a prominent center for science and the arts, as well as for independent research evaluation through follow-up questionnaires. We selected commonly-performed and generally uncomplicated elective procedures, starting with laparoscopic gastric bypass in Year 1; expanding to include robotic and laparoscopic hysterectomy in Year 2; sleeve gastrectomy in Year 3; robotic nephrectomy in Year 4; cholecystectomy in Year 5; and then adding endoscopic therapeutic interventions.

General video gaming has demonstrated altered cortical-plasticity and improved baseline/acquisition of minimally invasive skills. The present study aimed to evaluate for skill acquisition associated with a commercially-available dedicated laparoscopic video-game (Underground) and its unique (laparoscopic-like) controller for the Nintendo\u00ae Wii U\u2122 console. Methods and Procedures: This single blinded randomized controlled study was conducted with twenty laparoscopically naive student volunteers of limited (\\3 hours/week) videogaming backgrounds. Baseline laparoscopic skills were assessed using four basic tasks on the Virtual Reality (VR) simulator (LAP Mentor TM , 3D systems, Colorado, USA). Participants were randomized to two groups; Group A were requested to complete five hours of video-gaming (Underground) per week and Group B were to avoid gaming beyond their normal frequency. After four weeks participants were reassessed using the same VR tasks. Changes in simulator performances were assessed for each group and for intragroup variances using mixed model regression. Results: Significant inter and intragroup performances were present for the video-gaming and control group across the four basic tasks. The video-gaming group demonstrated significant improvements in thirty-one of the metrics examined including dominant (p\u22640.004) and nondominant (p\\0.050) instrument movements, pathlengths (p\u22640.040), time taken (p\u22640.021) and end score (p\u22640.046,[task-dependent]). The control group demonstrated improvements in fourteen of these measures. The video-gaming group demonstrated significant (p\\0.05) improvements compared to the control in five metrics. Despite encouraged game-play and the console in participants' domiciles, voluntary engagement was lower than directed due to factors including: game enjoyment (33.3%), lack of available time (22.2%) and entertainment distractions (11.1%). Conclusion: Our work revealed significant value in training using a dedicated laparoscopic videogame for acquisition of virtual laparoscopic skills. This novel serious-game may provide foundations for future surgical developments on games consoles in the home environment.Innate Predictors of Acquisition and Retention of Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) Task PerformanceCuan M Harrington, Patrick Dicker, Oscar Traynor, Dara Kavanagh; Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland",

With the implementation of a new resident acute care surgery service managed by our senior residents with attending supervision, we sought understand if autonomy for laparoscopic procedures had improved and if our residents ranked their confidence and autonomy equivalent to open procedures. Methods: All general surgery residents over a one-year period completed self evaluations on individual operative case performance. For each procedure, an attending evaluation of the resident's performance was also submitted. We compared evaluations for laparoscopic abdominal procedures to open abdominal procedures and further analyzed those evaluations specific to the resident acute care surgery service as compared to attending services. Results: A total of 1775 resident evaluations were collected for abdominal cases. Of these, 1072 cases were laparoscopic cases and 703 were performed open. On average both residents and attendings ranked resident's performance on laparoscopic procedures significantly higher than open procedures in all categories: knowledge of procedure, intraoperative communication and overall grade. Additionally, Zwisch scale of autonomy was significantly higher for laparoscopy compared to open by both attendings and residents (2.70 vs 2.35 and 2.52 vs 2.19 respectively, p\\0.001). When we compared evaluations for laparoscopic cases done under the resident acute care service compared to attending services, residents' ranking of Zwisch scale of autonomy was significantly higher on the resident acute service (3.27 vs 2.36, p\\0.001) and similarly attendings' ranking of Zwisch scale of autonomy was also higher on the resident service (3.20 vs 2.54, p\\0.001). Conclusions: The highest ratings of autonomy were give to laparoscopic procedures on the resident acute care surgery service when both compared to procedures performed on attending services and when compared to open procedures. We conclude that the structure of a resident acute care surgery service highly increases the autonomy and confidence of chief residents with laparoscopy prior to graduation.Suture Training Simulation Prior to Medicine Elective in Medical Students: A Randomized Controlled TrialMartin Inzunza, MD, Rodrigo Tejos, MD, Emma Alexander, Jose Quezada, MD, Ruben Avila, MD, Nicolas Jarufe, MD, Julian Varas, MD, Pablo Achurra, MD; Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile",

The shorter-lasting GSR must optimize residents' exposure to surgical time. Simulated training is a tool which could help to optimize surgical training during the GSR. The aim of this article is to describe the outcomes of a 3-year GSR program and to analyze the effect of introducing a validated laparoscopic surgery training program (LSTP) in the number and type of abdominal surgical procedures performed by residents. Methods: A non-concurrent cohort study was designed. We included graduated surgeons (GS) between the years 2012-2015 (four generations). Data was obtained from institutional records and from prospective residents' records during their GSR. Only surgical interventions of the abdomen as a primary surgeon were described and analyzed. The control group (NLSTP) were GS from 2012, not trained with LSTP. Surgical procedures per program year (PGY), surgical technique, priority of the intervention and hospital-site were described. We calculate the annual range of procedures and residents per staff to analyze the institutional changes effects on resident's surgical exposition in the follow-up period. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA test for related samples, X2 or Student's T test according to the nature of data. Results: Interventions of 28 GS were analyzed (NLSTP: 5 GS and LSTP: 23 GS). The average of procedures and residents per staff for the entire follow-up period were 166 and 0.98 respectively. There were no statistically significant differences when comparing the annual average of procedures and residents per staff. Residents performed a mean of 372 abdominal procedures, with a higher mean number of medium to complex procedures in the LSTP group(Table 1). Residents trained with LSTP performed a higher number of all and laparoscopic abdominal procedures [384 vs 319 (p=0.04)] and [183 vs 148 (p? 0.05)] respectively (Fig. 1). Conclusion: General surgeons graduated from a 3-year residency program performed diverse abdominal procedures through each PGY. Introduction of a laparoscopic simulated training program appears to increase the number of all and laparoscopic abdominal procedures.Validation of Simulator for Assessment of Developed Suturing Skills 2nd ReportMunenori Uemura, PhD 1 , Noriyuki Matsuoka 2 , Morimasa Tomikawa, MD, PhD 1 , Makoto Hashizume, MD, PhD 1; 1 Kyushu University,",

Results: The scores of QS and NQS for air pressure leak were 2.09\u00b11.30 and 1.68\u00b11.18, respectively; for full-thickness sutures 4.46\u00b10.73 and 4.10\u00b11.08, respectively; for suture tension 3.25\u00b11.24 and 3.27\u00b11.12, respectively; for area of wound opening 4.07\u00b11.05 and 3.24\u00b11.07, respectively; and for performance time 3.98\u00b10.97 and 3.24\u00b11.07, respectively. Significant differences (p\\0.01) between QS and NQS were observed for air pressure leak, full-thickness sutures and performance time. Conclusions: This system could distinguish between the two groups (skillful and not skillful surgeons) from the viewpoint of the suturing surgical skill clearly and would be therefore a useful tool for training and assessment of laparoscopic surgeons.Maintaining Confidence: A 6-Month Follow Up of the Sages Flexible Endoscopy Course Walter B Kucera, MD 1 , Matthew Nealeigh, DO 1 , Brian J Dunkin, MD 2 , E Matthew Ritter, MD 1 , Aimee K Gardner, PhD 3; 1 Uniformed Services University/Walter Reed National Military Medical Center,",

Here we examine general surgery residents' performance on the five tasks tested for FLS certification in order to determine which tasks should be focused on inside and outside the simulation lab. Methods and Procedures: From October 2009 through October 2016, 139 general surgery residents were evaluated during a minimally invasive rotation using the FLS Laparoscopic Trainer Box. Proficiency was analyzed in the following five areas: Peg Transfer, Precision Cutting, Ligating Loop, Suture with an Extracorporeal Knot, and Suture with an Intracorporeal Knot. Residents were proctored by a MIS attending physician. Results: In the Peg Transfer Task, 100% of residents were able to complete the task. The average time of completion was 102 s (range 41 s-261 s). 4 residents performed an error (2.9%). In the Precision Cutting Task, 93% of residents were able to complete the task. The average time to complete the task was 162 s (range 80 s-290 s). 28 residents performed an error (20.1%). In the Ligating Loop Task, 92% of residents were able to complete the task. The average time to complete the task was 97 s (range 43 s-253 s). 21 residents performed an error (15.1%). In the Extracorporeal Knot Task, 92% of residents were able to complete the task. The average time to complete the task was 214 s (range 100-405 s). 44 residents performed an error (31.7%). In the Intracorporeal Knot Task, 89% of residents were able to complete the task. The average time to complete the task was 248 s (range 72-565 s). 10 residents performed an error (7.2%).Conclusions: Residents had the highest completion rate and least amount of errors performed in the Peg Transfer Task. The Extracorporeal & Intracorporeal Knot Tasks were the most frequently failed exercises with the highest percentage of errors seen in Extracorporeal Knot Task. Accuracy and immediate improvement in time scores can be seen with teaching and attending direction on needle handling and suturing techniques. Therefore, residents should focus on Extracorporeal and Intracorporeal Knot Tasks while in the simulation lab.

Kyle Hunt, MD, FRCSC 1 , Aristithes Doumouras, MD 2 , Dennis Hong, MD, MSc, FRCSC, FACS 2; 1 University of Toronto, 2 McMaster UniversityIntroduction: Higher operative volumes are associated with improved patient outcomes in bariatric surgery. As studies have shown that experience and learned skills in surrogate surgical operations may be transferrable to a specific index operation, the question remains as to whether this also applies to bariatric surgery. The goal of the study is to investigate whether bariatric surgeons who perform high volumes of non-bariatric surgery show an improvement in their patient outcomes after bariatric surgery. Methods and Procedures: This was a retrospective population-based review of all patients aged[18 y receiving a bariatric procedure in Ontario from 2008 to 2015, using Canadian Institute of Health Information databases. Individual surgeon outcome data of 29 bariatric surgeons was collected for analysis and grouped for bariatric and non-bariatric surgeries. The main outcome of interest for this study was all-cause morbidity after bariatric surgery during the index admission. All-cause morbidity included any documented complication which extended length of stay by 24 hours or required reoperation. Bariatric cases included Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Non-bariatric cases included all general surgery cases except for hernia repairs, both open and laparoscopic (cholecystectomy, colectomy, appendectomy, etc.). Univariate analysis was performed with Chi-squared test. Multivariate analysis with adjustment using a random effects model for surgeon and hospital-level correlation was performed, with multilevel logistic regression performed using Markov Chain modelling for the final model. Results: For bariatric surgeons in Ontario, the average number of bariatric and non-bariatric operations per year was 78 (88% RYGB) and 72 respectively. A significantly higher proportion of complications after bariatric surgery was seen in older patients, those with hypertension, severe diabetes, and coronary artery disease. A reduction in complications was seen when bariatric surgeons exceeded 50 bariatric cases (OR 0.66, CI 0.50-0.86, p=0.002). As for performance of non-bariatric surgery, higher volume was not shown to significantly affect complication rates after bariatric surgery, even when exceeding 100 cases (OR 0.95, CI 0.71-1.25, p=0.66).",

Low cost trainers can be developed from common household materials, and we constructed the Twelve Pack Box Trainer using an empty box of soda and either a Samsung Galaxy S6 or an iPhone 6 as both the camera and screen. Previous studies evaluating low cost trainers have not compared resident performance to standard trainers. This study tested resident performance of the FLS peg transfer task on the Twelve-Pack Box (TPB) trainer vs. the standard FLS box. Methods: Ten residents were asked to perform the Peg Transfer task twice consecutively on both the standard FLS trainer and the TPB Trainer for a total of 4 repetitions. Half used FLS box first while the other used the TPB trainer first before crossing over the other trainer. Each repetition was timed with a stopwatch. Afterwards, residents were asked to complete an online survey about the two trainers. Using a Likert Scale, residents rated their comfort performing the Peg Transfer, the screen resolution, size, and overall opinion of the Twelve-Pack Box Trainer. Results: Ten residents (PGY1: 6, PGY2: 1, PGY3: 3) participated; three were FLS certified. Median peg transfer time on the FLS trainer (63.5 s, IQR: 57.5-72.5) was significantly lower than on the TPB trainer (114.5 s, IQR: 95.5-155) (p\\0.001). There was no significant difference in total errors between the two trainers (p=0.3). FLS certified residents were significantly faster than non-FLS certified residents on both trainers (p\\0.01). All residents felt the task was more difficult on the TPB trainer with 30% stating the TPB trainer was less comfortable to use, and 60% stating the screen was too small. Most residents felt the TPB trainer adequately portrays the 3D space in 2D well (70%) and mimics the fulcrum effect of laparoscopy (90%). Half of the residents responded that they would use the TPB trainer at home. Conclusion: The TPB Trainer, while cost efficient and effective in simulating effects of laparoscopy, was more difficult for residents to use than the standard FLS trainer, likely due to the small size of the smartphone screen. With only half of residents willing to use it as a take home simulator, other low-cost options should be explored to improve access to simulation outside the hospital for residents.Usefulness of the Rubric Evaluation as the Qualitative Evaluation of the Laparoscopic TrainingTakashi Iwata 1 , Masashi Akaike 1 , Jun Higashijima 2 , Takuya Tokunaga 2 , Masaaki Nishi 2 , Hideya Kashihara 2 , Chie Takasu 2 , Daichi Ishikawa 2 , Mitsuo Shimada 2; 1 Research Center for Education of Health Bioscience, The University of Tokushima Graduate School,",

Lurie Children's Hospital, 2 University of Guadalajara, 3 University of Utah, Ohio State University Medical Center, 5 Centro M\u00e9dico ABC Introduction: SAGES Global Affairs Committee, in partnership with the Asociaci\u00f3n Mexicana de Cirug\u00eda General, launched the International Laparoscopic Advancement Program(iLAP), that seeks to standardize laparoscopy training and education across Mexico. iLAP participants engage in didactic and hands-on modules in educational theory, laparoscopic techniques, and simulation based education (SBE), and then develop and implement a 1-day surgical simulation course for trainees. The purposes of this study were to characterize existing minimally invasive surgical (MIS) experience, evaluate baseline educational knowledge and skills, and determine implementation success after an intensive education course. Methods and Procedures: All13 faculty and 13 of 25 resident participants completed a pre-course survey. Participants self-reported baseline MIS experience and comfort levels with MIS skills and procedures using a 3-point Likert scale (1=not comfortable, 2=somewhat comfortable, 3=very comfortable), and noted previous surgical education experience. Following the course, faculty self-rated their comfort level with educational techniques and institutional support for MIS, and provided qualitative course feedback. Resident participants self-rated their comfort level with MIS skills following the faculty-lead simulation course. Descriptive analyses were performed. IRB-exemption was obtained through Lurie Children's Hospital. Results: Faculty performed a range of MIS procedures, 100% of participants had experience with cholecystectomy compared to 54% with colectomy and 23% ventral hernia repair. Resident MIS exposure was notably lower. Most faculty self-reported being \"somewhat\" or \"very comfortable\" with MIS skills (range 66-100%), resident comfort level with MIS skills was lower(Table 1). Most common faculty-cited reasons for not performing MIS were lack of comfort with MIS skills (44%) and lack of institutional support for MIS (28%). There was limited baseline experience with educational methods, including no experience with skills assessments and curriculum development. On postcourse evaluation,100% of faculty participants self-reported as comfortable performing objective skills assessments and implementing a surgical education curriculum. Additionally, after participation in the faculty-implemented SBE course, residents self-reported improvement in all MIS skills. Conclusions: While the majority of surgeons at a large, Mexican teaching hospital are performing laparoscopic surgery, the institutional support for MIS is often lacking, and formalized MIS training is in early development. The iLAP initiative seeks to drive adoption and sustainability of safe laparoscopic techniques and increase educational awareness and effectiveness. After instituting a short, intensive surgical education course, participants self-reported improvement in educational and MIS skills. However, long-term adoption of these educational strategies for sustainable improvements in MIS remains to be assessed.Design of the Electrosurgery Skill Trainer (VEST) Direct and Capacitive Coupling Effects ModuleCarlos A Lopez, PhD 1 , Asish Misra, MD 2 , Nicholas B Milef, BS 1 , Nicole Santos 3 , Akole Lamien 4 , Caroline G.L.

The script concordance test (SCT) is used to assess clinical reasoning, but has never been applied to assessment of the cognitive aspects of operative skills. The purpose of this study is to provide evidence for validity of this novel SCTbased online assessment for LS skills. Methods: We previously designed a video-based online SCT for laparoscopic suturing using a cognitive task analysis and expert panelists. The CTA yielded 4 LS domains: needle handling (NH), tissue handling (TH), knot tying techniques (KT) and operative ergonomics (OE). The test was then administered online using a survey platform with embedded videos of Nissen Fundoplications and Paraesophageal hernia repairs. Five-point scales with anchoring descriptors from \u2212 2 to +2 were used. Scoring was based on a modified SCT methodology. Experts were defined as surgeons and fellows with LS experience of[25 cases annually. Their SCT scores were compared to inexperienced surgeons (surgeons, fellows and residents with less than 25 LS cases annually). Validity was assessed by comparing scores of experienced and inexperienced surgeons. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal consistency of the test. Results: The survey started off with 47 questions in each of the following domains: 13 NH, 4 TH, 20 KT and 10 OE. Thirty-seven surgeons (18 experts and 19 inexperienced surgeons) from academic and community practices across North America participated. Questions that demonstrated a large discrepancy among experts and panelists with a weighted score difference more than 40 were discarded (n=20). One question was discarded because it received a 100% score from all participants. This yielded twenty-six remaining questions in the following domains: 8 NH, 2 TH, 11 KT and 5 OE. The test reliability level (Cronbach a) was 0.80. The mean score was 72\u00b19% and 63\u00b115% (p=0.02) for experts and inexperienced surgeons, respectively. The mean time to complete the test was 21 minutes. Conclusion: This study provides validity evidence for a novel intra-operative LS assessment. The variability of responses between experts and panelists suggests that SCT may capture the clinical differences/surgeon preferences in performing LS intra-operatively. Integrating the SCT-based educational tool into a training curriculum may better prepare trainees for performing LS in the OR.

There is currently no consensus as to what type of mesh to use in these cases. Mesh choices are important as these range from \\50 dollars to thousands of dollars to repair hiatal hernia. Our practice has been using a 50-dollar PTFE felt mesh since 2012. This paper was designed to assess this low cost mesh's safety and efficacy profile. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 155 patients who had a Hiatal Hernia repair in a private practice setting between July 2012 and July 2017. Patients Demographic data was analyzed and their complications were collected and analyzed. Patient complications were measured at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Results: There were no mesh related complications in our study group. There were eight recurring Hiatal Hernias. Three patients did not want a reoperation as their symptoms were controlled with proton pump inhibitors. Five patients had reoperations where the hiatal hernia repair was repeated. Conclusion: Inexpensive PTFE felt mesh is not prone to erosions. Additionally, it is an effective method to treat Hiatal Hernias.Introduction: Although esophagectomy remains the cornerstone for the treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma, the recommendation of surgical resection is often conditioned by patient's age. We aimed to assess the trends in utilization of surgical treatment for esophageal adenocarcinoma in the US stratified by age groups. Surgical resection is scarcely used in patients older than 70 years old in the US, and they are significantly less likely to have surgery compared to their younger counterparts. Further investigation of surgical outcomes in elderly patients is warranted to determine if surgical treatment is underutilized in a large proportion of esophageal adenocarcinoma patients.",

Laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma is comparable to the open approach with regard to oncologic principles of resection, with equivalent margin status and adequate lymph node retrieval, demonstrating technically feasibility and equivalent 5-years survival.

Introduction: Historically, surgery was offered to all patients with giant paraesophageal hernia to avoid the risks of gastric volvulus and incarceration. A paradigm shift occurred 15 years ago when decision-model analysis showed watchful waiting to be superior to elective laparoscopic repair (LPEHR) for elderly and minimally symptomatic patients due to high rates of morbidity and mortality with elective surgery. Recent reports suggest modern era outcomes have improved, such that elective repair may now be favorable for more patients. Furthermore, the morbidity of emergency surgery may still be significant. The objectives of this study were to compare modern-era surgical outcomes after elective and emergency repair of giant paraesophageal hernias at a high volume tertiary care center. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of all Type II-IV paraesophageal hernia repairs performed betweenJan 1, 2012 and Sept 15, 2017. Type I hiatal hernias (HH), HHs after esophagectomy, and cases with planned simultaneous procedures other than cholecystectomy were excluded from the final analysis. Comparisons between groups were made using t-test for continuous variables and chi squared test for categorical variables. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for morbidity. Results: A total of 309 cases were reviewed of which 194 met inclusion criteria (17 emergency, 177 elective).

This impairs the hiatal dissection in 29.8% of cases. It results in failed Nissen fundoplication in 6% of patients. It leads to increased incidence of operative bleeding to 4.1%. The combination of using ESAK employed for tight joint spaces and the natural orifice TIF procedure are well engineered to tackle the space limitation created by the presence of an ALHA. This technique allows precise placement of the knots with single insertion of the knot pusher. TIF enable the surgeon to perform adequate partial fundoplication endoscopically thus avoiding the confined surgical field.

Thyroid hormones are major regulators of the basal metabolic rate. The imbalance of energy expenditure and energy storage regulated by these hormones play an integral role in metabolic disorders, such as obesity. Several studies have tried to identify the relationship between thyroid hormone levels, obesity, and weight loss. Methods and Procedures: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science prior to May 2017 was completed. Title searching was restricted to the following keywords/terms: sleeve gastrectomy/gastric bypass AND thyroid. After removing duplicate titles, 148 primary studies and abstracts were reviewed for inclusion into the systematic review. Inclusion criteria included English studies with five or more patients, age 16 or older, patients undergoing primary bariatric surgery, and outcome reporting of pre-or post-operative weight, TSH, free T4, or free T3. Exclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with overt hyper-or hypo-thyroidism, and patients on thyroid replacement therapy. Results: Sixteen primary studies (N=1556) were included in the systematic review. The average pre-operative BMI was 46.6\u00b13.8 kg/m 2 , which decreased to 32.7\u00b12.4 kg/m 2 post-operatively (ten studies, n=798). All studies with documented pre-and post-operative TSH levels reported a decrease in TSH following bariatric surgery. The average pre-operative TSH was 2.6\u00b11.1 mU/L, which decreased to 1.8\u00b10.4 mU/L post-operatively (nine studies, n=736). Free T4 levels increased on average by 0.62 pmol/L (five studies, n=246), and free T3 levels decreased on average by 0.57 pmol/L (two studies, n=34). Two studies identified 79 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) pre-operatively with an average pre-operative TSH of 5.69 mU/L and pre-operative free T4 of 14.79 pmol/L. Following RYGB, TSH levels decreased on average by 2.94 mU/L into euthyroid range. Four studies found a statistically significant positive correlation between TSH and BMI at baseline. None of the studies found that lower TSH was correlated with greater weight loss. Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between TSH and BMI at baseline, but no predictors of weight loss were identified. Bariatric surgery leads to a decrease in TSH levels. Subclinical hypothyroidism improved or resolved after RYGB. Further research is needed to try to identify potential hormonal predictors of weight loss associated with bariatric surgery.Comparing Complications in Classic Versus Staple First Sleeve GastrectomyLisa Y Shimotake, Lisa Dobruskin, MD, Wai Yip Chau, MD; Princeton Healthcare System Background: Bariatric surgery is a rapidly evolving field with a wide variety of techniques. In its infancy, there were several approaches to restricting intake and/or absorption. Over the past decade, sleeve gastrectomy has become the most commonly performed weight loss surgery, comprising 58.4% of bariatric surgeries performed at this time. Although this surgery is relatively standardized, there are variations in techniques that ought to be investigated in order to optimize this and other surgeries for the bariatric population. Objective: In this retrospective observation study, our goal was to compare the classical sleeve gastrectomy to the staple first technique with respect to outcomes and complications. We compared frequency of complications, including anastomotic leakage, pulmonary embolism, MI, and transfusion requirement. We predicted there is no difference between either surgical approach. Methods: A database was created through a chart review of a single site with two bariatric surgeons. Each surgeon has different surgical approaches to the gastric dissection when performing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Patients included in the study underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in 2014 through 2016 by either of these surgeons. Results: A total of 443 patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in 2014-2016, 214 via the classic approach and 229 via the staple first approach. The classic approach group consisted of 74.3% females and 25.7% males. The staple first approach group consisted of 76.9% females and 23.1% males. Initial BMI for each group were similar, 42.9 for the classic approach and 43.3 for staple first. There were 12 complications, consisting of re-operations, re-admissions, pulmonary embolism, and intra-abdominal infection. Seven of these patients underwent the classic approach, while five underwent the staple first approach, demonstrating a 3.3% and 2.2% complication rates, respectively. Conclusion: It was found that the there is no difference in complication rates between the staple first and classical techniques. Further investigation must be done to compare these and other approaches to the sleeve gastrectomy, as it is rapidly becoming the most popular technique performed in the States.Clinical Outcomes of Intensive Medical Treatment vs Sleeve Gastrectomy for Diabetes in Morbid Obesity-A Meta-analysis of the LiteratureChike Okolocha 1 , Leo Larios 1 , Sitembile Lee 1 , Aliu Sanni, MD, FACS 2; 1 Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine -Georgia Campus, 2 Eastside Bariatric and General Surgery Introduction: Diabetes and obesity are known to have a strong correlation as about 90% of type II diabetics are obese. Studies have shown that bariatric surgery in the obese result in optimal glycemic control, reduction of co-morbidities, and often even superior when compared to Intensive Medical Treatment (IMT) in the treatment of diabetes. The aim of this review is to evaluate the outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as it compares to IMT for the treatment of DM in morbid obesity. Methods: A systematic review was conducted through PubMed to identify relevant publications from 2012 to 2016 with comparative studies on LSG and IMT for management of diabetes in morbid obesity. The outcomes analysed included Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Body Mass Index (BMI) reduction and Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) mg/dL. Results are expressed as standard difference in means with standard error. Statistical analysis was done using fixed-effects metaanalysis to compare the mean value of the two groups. (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.3.070 software; Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ). Results: Three out of 24 studies were quantitatively assessed and included for this meta-analysis. A total of 53 patients underwent LSG and 56 patients IMT for the control of diabetes. HbA1c (\u22120.77 \u00b10.20; p\\0.05), BMI reduction (\u22121.72\u00b10.23; p\\0.05) and FPG (\u22121.384\u00b10.25; p\\0.05) were all significantly lower in the LSG group when compared to the IMT group. Conclusion: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is more effective in the management of diabetes in morbid obesity when compared to intensive medical treatment.P610 A Study of Revision Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy in a Single UnitMatthew J Lyon, MD 1 , Kamal Heer, MD 2 , Harish Kumar, MD 1;",

Patients with morbid obesity and end stage cardiac failure may require bariatric surgery in order to access this life-saving procedure. Methods: We performed a retrospective assessment of the outcomes of consecutive morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy who would otherwise meet eligibility for cardiac transplantation. Results: 4 male patients (age range 28-56 years) underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy over the period 2016-17. All patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 15%, one secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy and the other 3 with familial non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two patients had an ICD in situ and the other two had left ventricular assist devices in place at the time of surgery. One patient had previously had a gastric band placed with no weight loss over two years following this procedure. The median BMI at time of surgery was 51.4 kg/m 2 (range 42.8-61.6). The median length of stay was 5.5 days (range 4-7 days). None of the patients experienced a post-operative complication despite significant co-morbidities in this cohort including hepatitis C related cirrhosis, haemophilia A, previous stroke, previous pulmonary embolism and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The median percentage weight loss at 1 year post surgery was 72.2% (range 48.4-88.2%). Two patients successfully underwent cardiac transplant at 8 and 18 months post-op; the other two continue to but have noted a stabilisation of cardiac physiology and improved functional capacity with weight loss. Conclusions: Careful multi-disciplinary management of patients requiring weight loss in order to qualify for cardiac transplantation is feasible and safe with good intermediate outcomes.",

Univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression were performed. Results: 140,649 patients underwent primary operations in 2015. Of these, 8,082 (5.75%) had a BMI \u226560. Patients with BMI \u226560 were more likely to be male (28.11% vs 20.79%), black (24.68% vs 16.41%), have limited ambulation (6.12% vs 1.79%), and have several comorbid conditions (p\\ 0.0001). They were less likely to undergo sleeve gastrectomy (60.64% vs 66.01%) or band (2.15% vs 3.13%), and more likely to undergo gastric bypass (32.12% vs 28.56%) or other procedures (p\\ 0.0001).

BMI\u226560 was an independent predictor of complications (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.2-1.46). Conclusions: Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery at MBSAQIP accredited centers is safe for patients with a BMI\u226560. However, univariate and multivariate analyses show that short term outcomes are slightly worse than in those with a lower BMI. This somewhat higher rate of complications need to be weighed against the significant benefits from surgery in order to help patients and providers decide if it is best to proceed with metabolic and bariatric surgery.P614 The Effect of Fibrin Glue or Suture on Leakage in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Sertac Usta, MD 1 , Koray Karabulut 1 , Hakan Artas, MD 2; 1 Firat University School of Medicine General Surgery Department, 2 Firat University School of Medicine Radiology Department",

Many surgical centers use age 65 as their cutoff for offering bariatric surgery. The objective of this study was to determine if the outcome of bariatric surgery (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy[LSG]  or laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass [LRYGB]) in patients age 65 or over was comparable to that in younger patients, with respect to the odds of readmission and the rates of an adverse event within 30 days of surgery. Methods and Procedures: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Participant Use Data File. Patients were selected if they underwent a LSG or LRYGB between January 1 and December 31, 2015. The primary outcome was the odds of readmission within 30 days of surgery. For each type of surgery (i.e. LSG or LRYGB), a multivariable logistic regression was performed to obtain an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 30-day readmission for patients age 65 or over. Rates of readmission, complications, reoperation, and death within 30 days of surgery were also calculated. Results: Within the LSG group, there were 92699 (94%) patients under age 65 and 5575 (6%) patients age 65 or over. Both groups had similar rates of 30-day readmission(3-4%), reoperation (1%), and death (0.1-0.3%), but the rate of complications was higher in the older group (5% vs. 2%). The adjusted OR for 30-day readmission for patients age 65 or over was1.13 (p=0.08,). Within the LRYGB group, there were 40606 (94%) patients under age 65 and 2743 (6%) patients age 65 or over. Both groups had similar rates of 30-day readmission (6-7%), reoperation(3%), and death (0.1-0.5%), but the rate of complications was higher in the older group (11% vs. 6%).

Included studies contained \u22655 adult patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy followed by RYGB and BPD-DS. Studies had to directly compare RYGB with BPD-DS. Results: Six primary studies (109 patients) were included, four of which underwent meta-analysis. There were 61 second-stage surgeries to RYGB and 48 to BPD-DS. The indications for RYGB were failed weight loss (65.1%), reflux (20.9%), dysphagia (9.3%), or as a planned two-step procedure (4.7%). BPD-DS indications were either failed weight loss (76.6%) or as a planned twostep procedure (23.4%). In three of the studies, mean change in BMI was not significant between BPD-DS and RYGB (11.0 kg/m 2 versus 8.54 kg/m 2 , MD \u22121.70, CI \u22126.73 to 3.34, p=0.51).

Transplant centers have strict BMI restrictions for candidacy on organ waiting lists, and additionally a relative size match is required between cardiac donors and recipients, further limiting a patient's ability to be transplanted if they are significantly overweight. Obese potential donors who may be a size match to our patient cohort are more likely to have hearts that are not suitable for transplantation. Our aim was to determine if bariatric surgery is effective for meaningful weight loss in advanced heart failure patients, and thus establish their cardiac transplant eligibility. Methods: We performed a retrospective study including end stage heart failure patients not eligible for transplant listing secondary to morbid obesity that underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) at a single institution from 2013-present. Patient demographics, operating time, length of stay, complications, weight loss, changes in medications, and transplant status were reviewed. Results were analyzed by student's t-test. Results: Five patients with advanced heart failure underwent LSG, four of whom had a leftventricular assist device in place. Mean age was 40.8 (26-53), Mean operating time was 83.5 minutes (66-102 minutes), average length of stay post-operatively was five days(3-8 days). There was a median follow up time of 7.5 months(3-42months). Mean excessive weight loss at the patient's last visit was 48.83% (77.45%-26.44%), with an average decrease in BMI of 11.16\u00b13.85 kg/m 2 (p=0.01). Secondary to modification of the stomach and alteration of gastric flora, dosing changes may be necessary in oral medications following LSG.

This included no randomized controlled trials. The average patient age was 43.3 years and 24.9% of patients were male. The average follow-up time was 3.66 years. One thousand nine hundred and sixty patients had at least one fracture of any type, and the total absolute number of fractures encountered was 2326. In all, 4.6% of patients who underwent bariatric surgery suffered from a fracture postoperatively. The greatest risk of fractures was associated with Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) (10.51%), followed by restrictive procedures such as Adjustable Gastric Band (AGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (5.71%), with the Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass having the lowest risk (2.66%). Of the fractures encountered, 1466 (63.03%) were of the lower extremity and pelvis and 763 (32.8%) were of the upper extremity. Only 90 (3.87%) axial skeleton fractures were recorded.",

While many have been made for different surgeries never has a predictive model been created to predict underperformers soon after SIPS. This model seeks to improve patient care helping surgeons know when to advise patients on more options to help them lose weight following the SIPS procedure. Methods: 161 patients met the criteria for this study. These patients underwent surgery at a single institution from June 2013 to December 2016. Non-linear Regression analysis was performed to interpolate weight loss at three months and at one year. A multilinear regression was run to determine the significant variables. A model was then constructed to predict weight loss at one year 3 months after the SIPS procedure. Results: Patients EWL% at three months, preoperative BMI, and the interaction between DM and HTN were found to be significant factors. The model has a R value of .763 and an average error of estimate of 10.6% EWL at one year.Conclusion: Surgeons can easily predict patient underperformance soon after SIPS. This allows surgeons to give more and alternative help for patients who may not reach their weight loss goals and improve individual patient weight loss.The Effect of Robotic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Concomitant Esophagopexy Hiatal Hernia Repair on Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease in Bariatric Patients Allison C Estep, MD 1 , Christopher J You, MD 2; 1 MedStar Union Memorial Hospital, 2 MedStar Franklin Square Medical Center",

Preoperative upper gastrointestinal contrast series was performed in 84.0% of the patients with the study showing a hiatal hernia in 71.0% of these patients. Preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in 94.5% of the patients with the study showing a hiatal hernia in 56.8% of the patients. Preoperatively, 29.7% of patients had a documented diagnosis of GERD. After RSG with esophagopexy, 64.0% of symptomatic patients had resolution of their GERD symptoms while 36.4% remained symptomatic following the procedure. New onset GERD was seen in 10.8% of patients who did not have a documented diagnosis of GERD preoperatively. None of the patients experienced recurrence of their hiatal hernia. Conclusion: This study showed that RSG with concomitant esophagopexy hiatal hernia repair improved GERD symptoms in over half of symptomatic patients. However, 10.8% of asymptomatic patients developed new onset GERD symptoms after undergoing the esophagopexy hiatal hernia repair. The resolution of GERD symptoms and new onset GERD rates are similar to the present rates in the literature for patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy. This suggests that the esophagopexy does not affect GERD, but may impact recurrence rate of the hiatal hernia. Long term follow up of these patients is needed to demonstrate this theory.An Initial Assessment of Pre-operative Coagulation Studies on the First 50 Patients in the Bariatric Program and Their Outcomes at Eastern Health St. John's, Newfoundland Felicia Pickard, MD, David Pace, MD; Memorial University of Newfoundland",

Results of a Propensity-Matched Analysis from the MBSAQIP Participant Use File Julietta H Chang, MD, Elan R Witkowski, MD, MS, Matthew M Hutter, MD, MPH; Massachusetts General Hospital Introduction: As Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures have become safer, postoperative length of stay (LOS) has decreased. Reducing LOS must be balanced by the risks of developing or recognizing postoperative complications outside of a hospital setting, and the risks of readmissions.The national average length of stay after LRYGB is 2.2 days (i.e. being discharged on POD#2), but single institution studies have shown that shorter hospital stays after surgery is safe. The MBSAQIP captures data on all cases performed at participating centers with clinically rich, standardized data collected by audited and trained clinical reviewers. A Participant Use File with patient-level 30-day postoperative outcomes from calendar year 2015 is now available. The objective of this study was to analyze the 30-day postoperative outcomes for patients who were discharged within 1 day after LRYGB, compared to patients who were discharged later. Methods: Patients were categorized within two groups: those discharged within one day after surgery (POD#1 or less) vs those discharged 2-3 days after surgery (POD#2-3). Patients with LOS[3 days were excluded to minimize confounding. Patient characteristics, intraoperative data, and 30-day postoperative outcomes were analyzed with univariate analyses. Propensity matched modeling was done matching on the characteristics of patients discharged on POD#1 earlier.Results: 45,368 nonemergent primary RYGB were performed in 2015. 37,647 (83.0%) were discharged within 3 days of surgery, of which 10,988 patients (24.2% of total) were discharged on POD#1 or earlier and 26,659 patients (58.8% of total) on POD#2-3. Unadjusted postoperative outcomes reveal decreased readmissions in the POD#1 or less group (4.75% vs 6.04%; p\\0.001), as well as fewer major complications (3.15% vs 4.54%; p\\0.001). Propensity-matched cohort analysis showed that rates of readmissions in the POD#1 or less group remained lower (4.74% vs 5.75%; p=0.004), as did rates of major complications (3.13% vs 4.60%; p\\0.001). Conclusion: This propensity-matched analysis of patients at MBSAQIP accredited centers reveals that early discharge after LRYGB is now being performed regularly (27% of the time), and is safe in appropriately selected patients. Major complication rates and readmissions rates were actually decreased in patients discharged within one day This suggests that surgeons who discharge patients by POD#1 are identifying the right patients with an appropriate early postoperative course to discharge within one postoperative day. It does not imply that all patients should be discharged on POD#1, or that early postoperative signs, symptoms or studies should be ignored in making the decision for discharge.Comparison of Standard and Long Alimentary Limbs in Conversion of Sleeve Gastrectomy to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass for Weight LossJingliang Yan, MD, PhD 1 , Andrew Strong, MD 1 , Joshua Landreneau, MD 1 , John Rodriguez, MD 1 , Matthew Kroh, MD 2; 1 Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland OH, USA, 2 Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland OH, USA and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE Introduction: Conversion of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may be performed either as a planned second stage operation, or as a revisional procedure for weight recidivism. In this setting, the role of a longer alimentary limb in promoting weight loss and reducing comorbidities has not been well established. Methods and Procedures: After IRB approval, patients undergoing conversion of SG to RYGB for weight related issues from 2007 to 2016 were identified. Conversions due to SG complications was excluded. Standard RYGB had a 150-cm alimentary limb, while long limb bypass (LL RYGB) had a 200, 250, 300 or 350-cm alimentary limb. Decision on the alimentary limb length was made by individual surgeon. Demographics, weight loss profile, comorbidities and nutritional status were retrieved and analyzed. Results: Thirty-nine patients meeting the criteria were identified. Seventeen patients underwent standard RYGB, and 22 underwent LL-RYGB. Average time between SG and RYGB was 21 months in the standard group, and 29 months in the long limb group. In the standard RYGB group, average weight and BMI at the time of SG and RYGB were 172 kg, 61 kg/m 2 , and 142 kg, 50 kg/ m 2 , respectively. In the LL-RYGB group, average weight and BMI at the time of SG and RYGB were 188 kg, 65 kg/m 2 , and 151 kg, 53 kg/m 2 , respectively. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups. Absolute weight loss and EWL% for the standard RYGB group were 19 kg and 32% at 6 months and 26 kg and 37% at 1 year follow up. For the LL-RYGB group, they were 17 kg and 22% at 6 months, and 17 kg and 23% at 1 year. Of the 9 standard and 10 LL RYGB patients who still had either diabetes or hypertension at the time of RYGB, 5/9 (56%) and 3/10 (30%) had improvement or resolution of diabetes or hypertension at follow up. Among those with laboratory values available, 64% of standard RYGB and 60% of LL-RYGB patients had postoperative iron deficiency, vitamin D deficiency or both. One patient who had a 250-cm alimentary limb suffered from Wernicke's encephalopathy due to severe thiamine deficiency. Conclusion: When converting from SG to RYGB, an alimentary limb [150 cm may not offer additional benefits in weight loss or resolution of weight related comorbidities. Longer alimentary limbs may also be associated with severe nutritional deficiencies.Luis Garcia, Dan Azagury, Homero Rivas, John Morton; Stanford",

Anastomotic leak is a rare but morbid complication, frequently requiring reoperation. Most identified risk factors appeared to be unmodifiable. Accurate risk stratification is paramount in helping the patient make an informed decision when choosing to undergo bariatric surgery.Gastric Band Around Bypass: Should We Recommend? Matt B Martin, MD 1 , Ben T Hoxworth, MD 1 , David H Newman, MD 1 , Lauren R Evans, RN, BSN 2 , Laurie Deaton, RN, MSN 2;Central Carolina Surgery, PA, 2 Cone Health Introduction: Weight regain following an initially successful gastric bypass is highly frustrating for the motivated patient. Beginning in 2011, our bariatric surgery practice began seeing patients who had weight regain following gastric bypass. Some of those patients were offered gastric band placement around their gastric pouch. Methods: This is a retrospective review of the 13 sequential gastric bands around gastric bypass patients that were performed between 2011 and 2017 at Cone Health, Wesley Long by Central Carolina Surgery, PA. Results: Thirteen patients underwent placement of a gastric band around their gastric bypass in years 2011 through 2017 at an average 9.5 years after their original bypass. Three patients had a prior open gastric bypass and the rest had been performed laparoscopically and all were single limb Roux en Y. Four of the patients had their original surgery in our group and nine came from elsewhere in the U.S.A. Motivating factors included comorbidity management and one patient needed to achieve weight loss to qualify for a kidney transplant. All patients underwent UGI or endoscopy to assess their pouch and had psych and dietary evaluations. The average age at the time of revision was 49 years (38-69) with an average BMI of 43. The pas flaccida technique was used and the anterior plication was done with the remnant stomach in 12 patients and one patient's pouch was used to plicate. Three patients had posterior crural repairs for hiatal hernias. All procedures were completed laparoscopically and patients were kept overnight for observation. There were no mortalities. First band fills were performed at 6 weeks. The average for follow-up of the group is 2 years with average weight loss of 40 lbs. Overall these patients were not as compliant with follow-up as band only patients. Two of the bands were removed. One had too much weight loss (BMI 18) with severe dysphagia and the other had evolving motility issues and worsening GERD. The patient with ESRD did qualify for transplant but is lost to follow-up. The patient who lost 135 lbs. and had her band removed for severe dysphagia has since regained all of her lost weight. Conclusion: Gastric banding can be performed with low risk to the patient with weight regain after gastric bypass. Sustained weight loss enhancement is marginal. These results do not support recommending this procedure to patients that have weight regain after gastric bypass.High Incidence of Hyperammonemia Consistent with OrnithineTranscarbamylase Deficiency After Bariatric Surgery Ivanesa Pardo, MD, FACS, Eugene Wang, MD, Matthew Sharbaugh, DO, Anyea Lovette, MS, RD, LD, Timothy Koch, MD, FACG, Timothy Shope, MD, FACS, FASMBS; Medstar Washington Hospital Center",

Both conditions have been identified as major global epidemics associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Overweight populations have a higher incidence, prevalence, severity, and progression of AF. Furthermore, subjects with AF have markedly reduced survival compared with subjects without AF. Our goal in this study is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on the risk of developing Atrial Fibrillation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent bariatric surgery at our institution from 2010 to 2015. Common demographics and comorbidities were collected, along with electrocardiograms readings preoperative and at 12 months follow-up. The risk was calculated based on previous criteria published by Schnabel RB, et al. All tests were two-tailed and performed at a significant level of 0.05. Statistical software R, version3.3.1 (2016-06-21)  was used for all analyses. Results: Of the 1330 patients reviewed, 3.6% (n=48) patients met the criteria for inclusion; Females and Caucasians composed 54.2% (n=26) and 72.9% (n=35) of our population respectively.

The rate of ulcer formation after surgery is different for each surgeon and surgical technique also seems to make a difference. The MBSAQIP database contains data from all US Centers of Excellence including complication rates. Methods: We queried the MBSAQIP database for the year 2015. This database includes patients that underwent metabolic or bariatric surgery and reports 30 day outcomes. Results: There are a total of 168,093 patients in the 2015 MBSAQIP database. Among this cohort, 53,255 patients had undergone gastric bypass. After implementing eligibility criteria, a total of 44,379 patients were included in the analysis (excluded patients due to repeat procedures 8,821 and age \\18). The average age and BMI of the included subjects in this study were 45 years and 45.9 kg/m 2 respectively with majority being females (80%). The incidence of ulcer in entire cohort was 155 of 44,379 (0.35 %, 95%CI: 0.297%, 0.409%). Among 155 patients with ulcer, 88 (57%) patients had only one procedure, 69 had an intervention (therapeutic or diagnostic endoscopy), 16 had readmission and 3 had reoperation. Sixty five (42%) patients had two procedures with the majority having both readmissions and endoscopy (n=59); and 2 patients had 3 (1%) procedures. The incidence of readmission, intervention and reoperation within 30 days were 6.5%, 2.8% and 2.6% respectively. Ulcer formation was most common in intervention group (11.4%) followed by readmission group (4%) and reoperation group (1.5%). The most common post-operative complications were unplanned ICU admissions 597 (1.4%) followed by transfusions (n=538, 1.2%), post operative UTI (n=211, 0.48%), and pneumonia (n=193, 0.43%). The occurrence of ulcer was associated with unplanned ICU admissions (6.45%), transfusions (5.16 %), post operative UTI (3.87%), sepsis (1.94%) and myocardial infarction (0.65%). Death occurred in 76 patients with no related cases to marginal ulcers. The risk of ulcer was associated with increased BMI (OR=1.02, p=0.01), presence of percutaneous transluminal cardiac catheterization (PTC)(2.17, p=0.038), histories of DVT(1.72, p=0.085) and PE(2.84, p=0.002). Conclusions: In a nationally reported database, anastomotic ulcer seems to occur rarely in the first month. The large majority are diagnosed and treated endoscopically with minimal need for surgical intervention. The risk of anastomotic ulcer was increased with increased BMI, DVT, PTC, and DVT/PE.Hiatal Hernia Repair Prior to Sleeve Gastrectomy Is Superior When Compared to Hiatal Hernia Repair with Sleeve Gastrectomy and Comparable to Gastric Bypass for Treatment of Preoperative GERD John DeBarros, MD, Michael J Orris, DO, Catherine Ho, DO, Thomas Buddensick, MD; Weightless Institute of Arizona",

Data regarding surgical technique, patient demographics, and postoperative complications was collected and maintained in a secure database. T-test, chi-square, and X software were used for analyses where appropriate; p\\0.05 was considered significant. Results: A single surgeon performed 51 procedures during this time period, exclusively utilizing a transoral approach for the gastrojejunostomy; the other surgeon performed 91 procedures, exclusively utilizing the transabdominal approach. The two groups were similar with regard to patient BMI (45 versus 46 with p-value 0.2) and age (49 versus 46 with p-value 0.26). Wound complications, including deep and superficial infections as well as seroma formation, were compared between the two groups. With the transoral anastomosis, 3 out of 50 patients formed seromas, 3 out of 50 developed deep infections, and 3 out of 50 had superficial site infections for a rate of 6% each and a total wound complication rate of 18%. In the transabdominal group, 2 out of 91 patients formed seromas, but none developed deep or superficial infections for a total wound complication rate of 2%. This was a statistically significant difference with p-value \\0.001. Conclusions: At this point in the evolution of the roux-en-y gastric bypass, both the transoral and the transabdominal methods are acceptable; however, our study suggests that the transabdominal approach may result in significantly fewer surgical site infections and overall wound complications. Therefore, the results of this study lead to the conclusion that a transabdominal method of circular stapled gastrojejunostomy is superior.",

Sleeve restriction was not associated with bougie size (36 Fr, 7.25 mm 3 vs 42 Fr, 8.43 mm3 ; p=0.15). There were 13 readmissions (6.8%); readmission was not associated with narrowest point diameter or sleeve volume (p=NS).

The mean total body weight loss at 6 months postop was 30.3%. Neither narrowest point diameter, sleeve volume, nor sleeve morphology correlated to weight loss at 6 months (p=NS). Overall complications and readmission rate did not correlate with sleeve morphology. Conclusions: Overall, sleeve volume and restriction does not seem to have an impact on reflux symptoms, weight loss at 6 months, or readmission. We also see no association between bougie size and restriction created or complication rate. This brings to question the importance of sleeve size and overall morphology when performing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.Variability in Cost for Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: A National AnalysisVikrom K Dhar, MD, Koffi Wima, MS, Brad M Watkins, Shimul A Shah, MD, Jonathan R Thompson, MD; University of Cincinnati Objective: Determinants of cost for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are poorly defined. We aim to characterize the variability in cost for LSG at the national level and identify which factors are predictive of increased cost. Methods: Using the University HealthSystems Consortium database, we identified 22,035 patients who underwent LSG between 2012-2014. Patients were grouped into tertiles (low, medium, high) according to cost of perioperative stay. Results: Patients undergoing LSG were of similar age and gender across all three groups. High cost patients were more often black(26.7% vs. 22.3% vs. 18.3%, p\\0.01), insured byMedicare/  Medicaid (33.8% vs. 25.5% vs. 19.9%, p\\0.01) and diagnosed with increased severity of illness (48.3% moderate/major vs. 40.1% vs. 34.3%, p\\0.01) compared to medium and low cost patients. Although high cost patients were shown to have clinically similar lengths of stay (2 days vs. 2 vs. 2), these patients had higher 30-day readmission rates(5.3% vs. 3.4% vs. 3.1%, p\\0.01). Interestingly, low cost patients were more often operated on by high volume surgeons (40.3% vs. 34.1%  vs. 29.7%, p\\0.01). On multivariate analysis, black race, government insurance, and increased severity of illness remained significant predictors of increased cost for LSG (all p\\0.01). Conclusion: Variability in cost for LSGs performed at academic medical centers is significantly associated with patient factors including race, insurance status, and severity of illness. These findings support further research into risk-adjusted bundled reimbursement policies for LSG.Standardization of Surgical Technique Reduces Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease After Laparoscopic Sleeve GastrectomyVikrom K Dhar, MD 1 , Justin T Graff, BS 1 , Dennis J Hanseman, PhD 1 , Brad M Watkins, MD 1 , Tayyab S Diwan, MD 1 , John M Morton, MD 2 , Jonathan R Thompson, MD 1; 1 University Of Cincinnati, 2 Stanford University",

Methods and Procedures: We retrospectively analyzed all RYGB cases in MBSA-QIP during 2015, and identified factors associated with 30-day complications using chi-squared analysis. Multiple logistic regression identified pre-operative factors independently associated with 30-day complication to develop a prediction score, verified using a Cochran Armitage trend test. Results: For 42,849 procedures, there were 3034 (7.1%) with any 30-day complication. Preoperative patient characteristics independently associated with increased risk of morbidity are shown inTable 1. A scoring algorithm was formulated by assigning points based on strength of the odds ratio(Table 1), with the final score a summation of points accrued. The rate of any 30-day complication was evaluated across the range of scores (Table 2). Higher scores were associated with a higher rate of morbidity (p\\0.0001 for each).Conclusion:We created and verified a morbidity prediction score for patients undergoing RYGB based on MBSA-QIP data.Bariatric Surgery Can Be Safely and Effectively Performed in Patients with Left Ventricular Assist DevicesAriela L Zenilman, MD, Diego R Camacho, MD, FACS, Jenny Choi, MD, Erin Moran-Atkin, MD; Montefiore Medical Center Introduction: Severe cardiac disease often warrants mechanical support via a left ventricular assist device to improve cardiac function. While this is an effective way of improving myocardial activity, it works synergistically with weight loss. Studies have suggested that for every 1-kg/m 2 increase in BMI, the risk of developing heart failure increases 5% in men and 7% in women. Obesity, a known risk factor for CAD, alters lipid metabolism leading to atherosclerosis and ischemic cardiomyopathy. In terms of cardiac transplantation, mortality rates are significantly higher in patients with BMI[35. Data shows that patients that lose at least 3 kg have a significant improvement in LVEF, NYHA class, and quality of life. While other studies have shown that myocardial function in this population has improved following weight reduction surgery, this study looks specifically at patients with LVADs in place. This study aims to show that bariatric surgery is effective and safe, achieving weight loss goals and providing a bridge to transplantation in patients with LVADs. Methods: After obtaining IRB approval, EMR was reviewed for patients with morbid obesity, defined as BMI [35 with obesity related health conditions, who have LVADs due to depressed cardiac function. Four patients in this group underwent bariatric surgery at Montefiore Medical Center in order to achieve satisfactory weight loss goals. Results: Each patient underwent a Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG). Due to significant comorbidities, patients were admitted to the hospital pre-operatively for optimization and management of anticoagulation. Average length of stay post LSG in this group was 4.5 days. Complications post-operatively showed to be related to anticoagulation of the patient. In terms of weight loss analysis, BMI and improvement in health conditions were followed after LSG. Each patient experienced a significant decrease in BMI with end goal of transplantation. Patient 1 and 2 underwent cardiac transplantation within 1 year of LSG. Patient 3 has completed assessment and deemed a transplant candidate at BMI of 32. Six weeks after LSG, patient 4's BMI reduced to 36 from 41, showing promise of transplant candidacy.Conclusion: Patients with multiple medical problems, not limited to cardiac disease requiring LVADs, can achieve weight loss goals safely by surgical means despite poor surgical candidacy. Complications post LSG were minimal and no different from the other patient groups. While limitations of sample size prevent statistical analysis, this study demonstrates promising outcomes for this high risk group in terms of a gateway to transplantation.The Effect of Helicobacter pylori on Postoperative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Valentin Mocanu, BSC, MD, Jerry Dang, BSc, MD, Noah Switzer, BSc, MPH, MD, Daniel Skubleny, BSc, MD, Xinzhe Shi, MPH, Chris De Gara, BSc, MB, MS (Lond), Daniel Birch, BSc, MSc, MD, Shahzeer Karmali, BSc, MPH, MD; University of AlbertaIntroduction: The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review to determine the impact of H. pylori on patients undergoing bariatric surgery.",

The search was performed using Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality and bias. Abstracts and titles were screened for inclusion by two independent reviewers as per PRISMA guidelines. Outcomes assessed in the meta-analysis included bleeding, anastomotic leak, excess weight loss using the Revman 5.3 software. Results: A total of seven studies with 255 435 subjects were included. Overall, the prevalence of H. pylori ranged from 0.13% to 41%. Of patients with H. pylori, the weighted mean age was 43.4 years, the weighted mean BMI was 45.0, and 69% were female. Meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant difference for postoperative complications including bleeding (OR 3.05; CI 0.26 to 36.20; P=0.38), leak (OR 1.72; CI 0.09-33.2; P=0.72), EWL at 12 months (MD \u22121.73; CI \u22123.61 to 0.16; P=0.07), or hospital LOS. In the lone study assessing marginal ulceration, H. pylori infection was found to be the largest independent predictor of development of marginal ulceration. Conclusions: Helicobacter pylori infection in patients undergoing bariatric surgery was not found to be adversely associated with bleeding, leak, weight loss or hospital length of stay. It was, however, found to be an independent predictor of marginal ulceration in the single study assessing this outcome. This systematic review suggests that further research to assess the impact of H. pylori on bariatric surgery is needed, especially with a focus on marginal ulceration.Evaluation of Surgical Line Reinforcement Procedure Effect on the Complications of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: Analysis of the Latest Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Data, 2015 Seyed Mohammad Kalantar Motamedi, MD, MPH 1 , Rami R Mustafa, MD 1 , Gwen Bonner, MD 1 , Amir Kasaeian, PhD 2 , Mujjahid Abbas, MD 1 , Tomasz Rogula, MD 1 , Leena Khaitan, MD, MPH 1; 1 University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, 2 Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. : There has been debates on the effectiveness of staple line reinforcement (SLR) in prevention of leaks in bariatric surgeries specifically Laparoscopic Gastric Sleeve (LGS). The earlier analysis of national data from Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) 2010-2014 was showing that at patient level, the SLR is increasing the rate of the leaks. (1) However it decreased the bleeding rate.Method: We used the most recent national data from MBSAQIP 2015(2). Univariate analysis and adjusted hierarchical logistic regression model were implemented to evaluate association of leaks with patient related factors as well as operation related measures. Patients with any missing data were excluded from the model. Results: Out of 168093 patients in MBSAQIP 2015 data 98292 (58.5%) had LSG. Data was available for 58876 (59.9%) cases of which 39504 (67.1%) had received SLR. In adjusted model, leaks were only associated with factors (Odds ratio, P-value) such as anticoagulation therapy (5.89, 0.003), history of previous surgery (1.95, 0.24) and bleeding (1.99, \\.001). Each 10 minutes increase in operation length was associated with 5% increase in leak (P-value\u2264.001). Also bleeding was only associated with anticoagulation therapy (4.5,\\.001), staple line check with provocative test (0.63, .001), drain placement (1.4, .008), hyperlipidemia (1.6, \\.001) and history of GERD (1.4, .008). Each 10 minutes increase in operation length was associated with 3% increase in probability of bleeding (P-value=0.02). SLR was not associated with leaks (p-value=0.75) or bleeding (P-value=0.4) in adjusted model. Conclusion: We found no evidence that SLR procedure might either decrease or increase the incidence of major complications such as bleeding or leaks in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. This finding differs from the previous MBSAQIP results for leaks. Provocative leak test is protective against bleeding by 37%. Operative time was associated with increased risk for both leaking and bleeding.References: 1. Berger ER, Clements RH, Morton JM, Huffman KM, Wolfe BM, Nguyen NT, et al.

Nationwide Analysis of Outpatient Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy and Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Over the Past Decade: Risk Factors for Morbidity and Readmission Miloslawa Stem, MS, James Taylor, MBBChir, MPH, Canner K Joseph, MSH, Alisa Coker, MD, Michael Schweitzer, MD, Gina L Adrales, MD, MPH; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Introduction: Bariatric patients are discharged frequently within one postoperative day. The aim of this study was to compare the safety of outpatient laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and to identify patients at risk for complications. Methods and Procedures: Adult patients with obesity (BMI\u226535) who underwent an elective outpatient LSG or LRYGB were identified using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database from 2005 to 2015. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for 30-day overall morbidity and readmission (2011-2015) for each procedure type. Results: 27,423 patients were included, with 58.72% of LSGs and 41.28% LRYGBs. The outpatient rate increased over time for LSG (20.33% in 2010 to 37.34% in 2015, p\\0.001) and LRYGB (13.92% in 2005-6 to 19.80% in 2015, p\\0.001).In comparison to LSG, LRYGB patients had significantly higher rates of overall morbidity (2.71% vs. 1.85%, p\\0.001) and readmission (4.44% vs. 2.62%, p\\0.001). LSG: patients with ASA IV-V, dyspnea, steroid use, and bleeding disorder had significantly increased risk of overall morbidity; while black race, COPD, dyspnea and bleeding disorder had significantly increased risk of readmission(TABLE). LRYGB: patients with BMI\u226550 and hypertension had increased risk of overall morbidity; while bleeding disorder had increased risk of readmission. Conclusion: Outpatient LSG carries a lower risk for morbidity and readmission than LRYGB. Although morbidity and readmission rates were acceptable for both procedures, patients with the identified risk factors should be more closely monitored. Bleeding disorder posed the greatest risk and may warrant a longer hospital stay.Introduction: The objective of this study is to determine socioeconomic factors that influence access to bariatric treatment and surgery in a publicly-funded healthcare program with a focus on Indigenous populations. Rates of obesity are markedly higher among Indigenous persons, estimated to be 37.8%, compared to 22.6% for non-Indigenous persons. Similarly, rates of diabetes are twice as high among Indigenous Canadians relative to the general population and disease onset frequently occurs at a lower body mass index (BMI) and younger age. In obese patients who are refractory to diet and exercise, bariatric surgery is a viable option, with demonstrated efficacy in sustained weight reduction and in many patients, hyperglycemic remission. The utilization of bariatric surgery in Indigenous populations has not been well documented, however in one study out of the United States, only 0.46% of bariatric surgery was performed on Indigenous patients. An understanding of the socioeconomic drivers underlying this disparity may enable physicians to identify at risk individuals, who may benefit from bariatric treatment. Methods: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was performed on all severely obese patients (BMI\u226535) discharged from the Edmonton Adult Bariatric Specialty Clinic in 2016. Socioeconomic data include gender, marital status, education, occupation, smoking status, alcohol use, estimated income and Indigenous status. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine socioeconomic factors that predict completion of bariatric surgery. Results: Seven-hundred-and-eighty patients met inclusion criteria, of which 0.9% were identified as Indigenous (n=7). Of the Indigenous cohort, all were unemployed, 71.4% were single, 57.1% had completed secondary education and 28.6% had completed college. None of these patients completed bariatric surgery. Due to low numbers, multivariate analysis was not completed for this cohort. For the whole cohort, 28.8% of patients successfully completed bariatric surgery. The main reasons for not completing the bariatric program were poor attendance (32.7%) and patient decision not to pursue surgery (22.0%). In multivariate analysis, patients who were married (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.2- 3.5), non-smokers (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.65), and female (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.56) were more likely to complete bariatric surgery. Education, income, and occupation were not predictive of completion. Conclusions: Despite an alarming rate of obesity and diabetes in Indigenous populations, very few Indigenous people are treated in specialized bariatric treatment centers. Further, major socioeconomic factors did not influence successful completion of bariatric surgery. Especially in a public healthcare system, more treatment should be directed at underserved Indigenous populations.Presurgical Gerd Evaluation of the Bariatric Patient. A Cross Sectional StudyPatricioCal, MD, Luciano Deluca, MD, Tomas Jakob, Diego  Lonardi, Ezequiel Fernandez; Hospital Churruca    Introduction: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a highly prevalent disease estimated to be present in 10-20% of Western adult population. Obesity has been established as a well-known risk factor. The goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of pre-surgical GERD among the bariatric population. Methods and Procedures: Between March 2014 and June 2017 246 patients underwent 24 hour pH-metry, manometry and upper GI endoscopy as part of a routine screening for GERD. Gender, age, BMI, DeMeester score, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) resting pressure and signs of esophagitis were recorded in a prospectively kept database. Results were reported as means \u00b1 standard deviations or 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Correlation between variables was studied using either Pearson or Spearman correlation tests and simple linear regression. Groups were compared with t-test, and a significance level of 0.05 was set. Results: Mean age was 43.4\u00b111.7 years and BMI 44.3\u00b16.3 kg/m 2 , 72.8% were female. Mean DeMeester score was 48.8 (95% CI 41.1-56.6), and mean resting LES pressure was 11.9 (95% CI 11.4-12.5) mmHg. Overall, 62.3% of patients had a DeMeester score higher than 14.7 and 34% had a hypotensive LES. In the bivariate analysis, there was no correlation between DeMeester score and BMI, age or gender. Only 10% had signs of esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus. DeMeester score was higher in patients with esophagitis (56.9\u00b112.4 vs 47.9\u00b14.1) although this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.48). Out of all patients, 64.4% had either an abnormal DeMeester score or erosive endoscopic signs. Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) accounted for 54% of all patients and for 86.9% of patients with abnormal pH-metry. Conclusions: Gastroesophageal reflux disease was diagnosed in 64.4% of patients under study for bariatric surgery. Endoscopy should not be relied on as the only diagnostic tool; as 87% of patients with abnormal pH-metry did not have esophagitis. This study suggests that GERD might be may be more prevalent than expected in the presurgical bariatric population.",

            "text": "Gastrectomy in Class 1 Obesity Patients, Is It Suitable Procedure?Sang-Moon Han, PhD; CHA UniversityIntroduction: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the leading weight loss procedure for treating morbid obesity. However, mid-term results of the isolated SG which was performed in lower body mass index (BMI) (30-35) are sparse. Methods and Procedures: We retrospectively reviewed 69 patients who underwent SG in class 1 obesity (30-35 kg/m 2 ) from January 2013 to December 2016. SG was performed laparoscopically using Endo-GIA stapler to create a lesser curve gastric tube over a 36-Fr bougie, and continuous sero-serosal suture at resection margin has been added. Results: The age before surgery was 35.3\u00b18.1. The mean weight and body mass index (BMI) before LSG were 87.9\u00b19.3 kg and 32.2\u00b11.5 kg/m 2 . The BMI at first, second, and third year postoperatively was 22.2\u00b12.3, 23.3\u00b12.6, and 23.8\u00b12.7. The percentage of excess BMI loss (cutoff BMI: 23) at postoperative first, second and third year was 109.7\u00b126.3, 97.1\u00b129.1, and 90.1\u00b1 30.0. However, the follow up rate is decreased by postoperative time. There was no 30-day perioperative mortality and major complications including bleeding and leakage. Conclusion: These finding show that SG is a very effective and safe weight loss option for class 1 obesity. However, proper weight loss concept after SG should be reconsidered to improve health in class 1 obesity. Also, randomized prospective control study between gastric banding and SG, or gastric bypass and SG are needed to confirm long-term weight loss effect and safety of SG in class 1 obesity.P656 A Retrospective Analysis of Clinical Outcome of Bariatric Surgery in Morbidly Obese Diabetes Mellitus Patients Ithiphon Viratanapanu, MD 1 , Chavalit Romyen, PhD 2 , Sikarin Sornphiphatphong, MD 1 , Worawit Kattipatanapong, MD 1 , Kongpon Tangpanitandee, MD 1 , Ajjana Techagumpuch, MD 3 , Krit Kitisin, MD 1 , Suppa-ut Pungpapong, MD 1 , Chadin Tharavej, MD 1 , Patpong Navicharern 1 , Patchaya Boonchayaanant, MD 4 , Suthep Udomsawaengsup 1; 1 Department Of Surgery, Faculty Of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, 2 Faculty Of Pharmaceutical Science, Chulalongkorn University, 3 Department Of Surgery, Faculty Of Medicine, Thammasat University, 4 Department Of Internal Medicine, Faculty Of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University Introduction: Bariatric surgery is a choice of treatment in morbidly obese patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) type II who has inadequate control diabetes with medical treatment. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcome of bariatric surgery in morbidly obese DM patients. Methods and Procedures: Retrospective study of morbidly obese patients with DM type II who underwent bariatric surgery in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from September 2003 to March 2016 was collected. Pre-operative body mass index (BMI), DM type II remission, blood pressure and lipid profile were compared with data at 1 year after surgery as clinical outcome by chi-square and T-test analysis.Results: A total of 73 patients were included in the analysis. Of all, 43 (58.9%) patients were women and mean (standard deviation, SD) age was 41.8 (12.2) years. At 1 year after bariatric surgery compared with pre-operative, 61 (83.6%) patients had DM remission; mean (SD) BMI was Bariatric surgery demonstrates BMI, DBP, TG level reduction, and DM remission with increases HDL level significantly at 1 year after surgery. Thus bariatric surgery can be an option for improve quality of life in morbidly obese DM patients.Effect of Intra-abdominal Pressure on Intracranial PressureMuhammad Nadeem, MD 1 , Steven Schwaitzberg, MD 1 , John Butsch, MD 2; 1 University at Buffalo, 2 Buffalo General Medical Center",

Conclusion: The Laparoscopic abdominal procedure raises the ICP. Therefore, we can surmise of increasing intra-abdominal pressure directly increase the ICP. Therefore obese patients who have inherently a high intraabdominal pressure will have higher ICP and This can contribute to pseudotumor cerebri. We are also using this model to study other effects of intrabdominal pressure on other comorbidities.The Red Flag: Substance Abuse Predicts Higher Complication Rate and Subsequent Surgical Procedures in Bariatric PatientsAndrew Bates, MD, Jie Yang, PhD, Lizhou Nie, BS, Salvatore Docimo, Jr., DO, Konstantinos Spaniolas, MD, Aurora Pryor, MD; Stony Brook University Hospital Introduction: The prevalence of substance abuse in bariatric patients has been well-documented in the literature. Several studies have alerted to the development of postoperative substance abuse in a small subset of bariatric patients. However, to what degree substance abuse affects patients' postoperative outcomes and utilization of additional surgical procedures remains unclear. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of a large-scale, state-based longitudinal hospital claims database (SPARCS) with mandatory reporting. All patients undergoing bariatric surgery between 2004 and 2010 were collected and outcomes were followed until 2014. Patients who had a diagnosis code for substance abuse within the previous 5 years before surgery were collected. Patients with revisional surgery, age less than 18, or lack of follow-up were excluded. Rates of subsequent surgery and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was performed to control for procedural and patient variables. Results: A total of 40,994 non-revisional bariatric patients were identified via inpatient and outpatient records. Patients with a previous diagnosis of substance abuse were shown to have longer lengths of stay following the index bariatric surgery(2.56 v. 1.96 days, p\\0.0001) and higher overall complication rate (7.45% v. 5.28%, p\\0.0001). Patients with substance abusewere more likely to undergo additional surgery after all types of bariatric procedures (p\\0.0001). Among all bariatric patients who underwent subsequent surgery, substance abuse patients had a shorter time interval to additional surgery (337 v. 479 days, p\\0.0001). Substance abuse patients had a higher rate of subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), but no difference in rates of diagnostic laparoscopy or hernia repairs. Conclusion: Bariatric surgery patients with a history of previous substance abuse experience a higher risk of postoperative complications and need for additional surgery, particularly laparoscopic cholecystectomy and EGD. These patients may require additional resources should they be deemed acceptable candidates for bariatric surgery.",

Patients at the extremes of age were excluded. Furthermore, only LSG operations without any staple line reinforcement were considered. Postoperative bleeding was taken as any hemorrhage requiring a blood transfusion within 72 hours of surgery or another intervention for bleeding. To account for differences in patient selection, propensity scores on preoperative factors were used to match patients undergoing LRYGB with those undergoing LSG. Subsequent multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the effect of the type of procedure on postoperative bleeding rates, adjusting for intraoperative factors. Results: A total of 168,093 patients from 742 centers were identified in the dataset. After applying our selection criteria, 65,881 patients met inclusion criteria: 43,280 (65.7%) with LRYGB and 22,601 (34.3%) with LSG.

Our study demonstrates that privately insured patients have less comorbidity at baseline, and they are prone to lose more weight compared to publicly insured patients after a12 months follow-up. Further studies may be needed to better assess these findings.Risk Factors for Bleeding Complications Following Bariatric SurgeryRyan Thorpe, Michael A Edwards, MD, FACS, Lauren D Warshaw, Daohai Yu, PhD, Rohit Soans, MD, Tatyan M Clarke, MD, FACS; Temple University School of Medicine Introduction: Bariatric Surgery remains the most reproducibly efficacious treatment for morbid obesity. Despite the elevated surgical risk generated by obesity-related co-morbidity, complications rates are lower in those undergoing bariatric operations than in those undergoing other types of surgery1. Nonetheless, quality measures which may reduce adverse outcomes remain a constant focus. Bleeding is a perioperative and postoperative sequela that is common to all modalities of surgical practice. Essentially all surgical bleeding complications may be considered potentially-preventable. The objective of our study is to identify factors involved in perioperative care of Bariatric Surgery patients that are predictive of postoperative bleeding. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent a Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) or Gastric Bypass (GBP) at Temple University Hospital between 1/1/2010-12/31/2015. Patients with a postoperative bleeding complication were compared to those who did not have postoperative bleeding. Variables in our univariate analysis included patient demographics, medical history, use of staple-line reinforcement, and preoperative, intraoperative, post-anesthesia hemodynamics. Results: 792 index Bariatric operations (541 GBP, 251 SG) were performed during the study period. 40% were Black and 24% Hispanic. There were 214 complications (all cause, 1-year morbidity) in 145 patient patients (18.3%). 12 patients (1.52%) had a postoperative bleeding complication, 1.48% (8) GBP and 1.59% (4) SG. Of those with a bleeding complication, 75%(9)required a re-operation (p\\0.001) and were more likely to have another complication (33% vs 17%). Gender, race/ethnicity, operative time, staple type, use of staple reinforcement, and type of operation did not significantly impact predisposition to bleeding. Variables that met or trended toward a significant association with postoperative bleeding are listed inTables 1 & 2. Patients with postoperative bleeding were generally older, had a lower BMI, poorly-controlled perioperative SBP, and used more than one anti-clot medication. Conclusion: Bleeding is a potentially devastating complication following bariatric surgery. Several patient-related, technical, and perioperative variables may be contributing factors. The findings presented here suggest that advanced age, a lower BMI, use of NSAIDs and anti-platelet medications, and perioperative management of hypertension may be associated with bleeding in our ethnically diverse patient cohort. Further research is required to identify independent-predictors for bleeding in this patient population.Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Lipid Profile in Morbidly Obese and Morbidly Obese Diabetic Patients. A OneYear studyFahad Alasfar, MD, FACS 1 , Ebaa Al Ozairi, MD 2 , Eman Al Shawaf 2 , Shaima Al Beloushi 2 , Hossein Arefanian 2; 1 Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, 2 Dasman Diabetes Institute, Kuwait Introduction: Since the Adoption of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) as a primary procedure in Bariatric surgery, many studies have shown the beneficial metabolic effects on morbidly obese patients. In this study, we analyze the effect of LSG on Lipid profile at one year in both Morbidly Obese (MO) and Morbidly Obese Diabetic (MOD) patients in comparison with lean and diabetic lean control. Method: Between January 2012 and July 2014, 23 MO and 17 MOD patients underwent LSG with 19 Lean Diabetic and 15 Lean Subjects as control. Sample were collected for Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL cholesterol and Triglycerides (TG) preoperatively then at 7, 15,30,60,90,180 and 360 days postoperatively. Results: Preoperative BMI, Gender and age were similar in both MO and MOD patients. At one year, both groups have similar EBWL. TG preoperatively was significantly elevated in MOD and MO in comparison with Lean Control. At one year, TG significantly reduced both MOD and MO. HDL cholesterol was significantly low in MOD compared with MO and Lean (0.01, and 0.0001 respectively). At one year, HDL cholesterol was significantly increased in both MOD and MO patients. Preoperatively, no significant difference in LDL and total cholesterol in all four groups. No changes found at one year postoperatively in total and LDL cholesterol in MOD and MO patients. Conclusion: LSG showed significant improvement in HDL cholesterol and TG in MOD and MO patients at one year. NO similar changes were found in total cholesterol and LDL.",

Present study was done to compare the intra-operative and post-operative outcomes of MGB as compared to Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) in the Indian population in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Material and Methods: Between January 2015 and July 2017, 46 patients underwent MGB (Group A-22 cases) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (Group B-24 cases) in a prospective study, including 5 super-obese patients in each group. Data of 40 patients (20 in each group at 30 months with a follow-up of 3-31 months in LSG and 12-24 months in MGB, was analyzed for peri-operative and post operative complications, weight loss achieved and resolution of co-morbidities.Results: Both groups were comparable for BMI at baseline [MGB=45.39 kg/m 2 (42.98-58.02) vs. SG=43.67 kg/m 2 (39.9-69.4) p=0.657]. Mean operation time was significantly lower in SG 135.8 vs. 166.8 min, p\\0.01) but the mean hospital stay was significantly lower in the MGB (3.4 vs. 5.4 days, p\\0.001). Percentage EWL in SG group of 24 patients at 3 months was 42.22 (40.34-44.78) and in 20 patients at 30 months is 70.45 (68.34-72.43). In the MGB group of 22 patients, % EWL at 3 months was 51.23 (47.23-54.01) and in 20 patients at 24 months is 78.74 (76.34-81.23).There were no mortalities in either groups. Two cases of staple line bleeding were seen in SG group, one of which required re-exploration. There was one leak which closed at 8 weeks on conservative management. No complications were noted in the MGB group. Resolution of co morbidities like DM, HTN and OSA was observed in both groups while this resolution was observed significantly early at 6, 8 and 2 weeks in the MGB group as compared to 12, 12 and 4 weeks for SG respectively. The mean hemoglobin and Albumin levels showed no significant difference before and after surgery in either groups. Conclusions: MGB achieved superior weight loss at 3 months and 24 months and had a lower complication rate compared with SG. Resolution of co-morbidites was faster in MGB compared with SG. Thus, MGB may be a viable alternative to RYGB as it appears to be better to SG for the treatment of morbidly and super-obese patients.Bariatric Surgery in Elderly, What Is the Cut Off Age? Rami R Mustafa, MD, Adel Alhaj Saleh, MD, Seyed Mohammad Kalantar Motamedi, MDMPH, Gwen Bonner, MD, Mujjahid Abbas, MD, Tomasz Rogula, Leena Khaitan; Cleveland Medical CenterBackground: Surgical treatment of obesity in the elderly remains controversial. As life expectancy increases, more elderly patients fit into the criteria for bariatric surgery. The aim of our study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in elderly patients and determine whether a cut off age for bariatric surgery in the elderly is warranted. Methods: This is a Retrospective study using the MBSAQIP 2015. Data were collected for demographics, Readmissions, and comorbidities. Postoperative outcomes evaluated include Myocardial infarctions, cardiac arrest, postoperative pneumonia, sepsis, unplanned intubations, Urinary tract infections and other complications. Findings were compared between groups and results were calculated using ASPSS 24, Chi Sq. and T-test. Results: The data base includes 168,009 patients, of which 22,339 were [60 years old. Those patients [60 were classified into 3 groups: 60-70 (G60; 20,468 pts) 71-80 (G70; 1871 pts) and [ 80 (G80; 32 pts). Females comprised the majority of each group (75% G60; 66.6% G70; and 71.9% G80). BMI differed between groups: 42 kg/m 2 +10 in G60; 39.35 kg/m 2 +11.8 in G70; 34.7 kg/m 2 +10 in G80. G80 averaged one comorbidity/patient whereas the other groups had 5 comorbidities/patients. Preoperative incidence of DM, Renal insufficiency, Hypertension, Obstructive sleep apnea and Hyperlipidemia were the least in the G80 group. G80 had the highest incidence of postoperative complications: Acute renal failure (3.1%, p=0.009), Myocardial infarction (3.1%, p= 0.000), postoperative pneumonia (6.3%, p=0.001), Sepsis (3.1%, p=0.007), reoperation in the first 30 days (9.4%, p=0.01), Post-Operative UTI (6.3%, p=0.000), unplanned intubation (3.1%, p= 0.005), and cases requiring ventilation postoperatively (3.1 % p=0.000). G80 had the least incidence of renal insufficiency preoperatively (1.6% in G60, 2.2% in G70 and 0% in G80, p=0.05) but developed the highest rate of postoperative acute renal failure (3.1%). Pre-Operative Pulmonary comorbidities were greatest in G60 and G70. Post-operative ventilation was higher in G70 than G60 (0.5% versus 0.2%, p=0.001). Conclusions: Although the oldest patients in this study had the fewest preoperative comorbidities, they had the highest incidence of complications. Patients over 80 should be approached with caution when considering bariatric surgery. Patients between 60 and 80 should be monitored closely for pulmonary complications. More aggressive pulmonary toilet may be necessary to avoid complications in this group.",

Prior investigation indicates an individual surgeon's experience with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) determines utilization. This study aimed to identify the effect of other factors, such as hospital, surgeon and patient demographics, as predictors of laparoscopic versus open inguinal hernia repair. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 342,814 inguinal hernia repairs performed in adults (\u2265age 18) from 2010-2015, using the Premier Perspective Database. Included were 241,669 open and 101,145 laparoscopic procedures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio of taking a laparoscopic approach compared to a reference group, with respect to ten demographic variables. Results: Use of laparoscopic MIS versus open inguinal hernia repair increased from 2010-2015 (Table 1). MIS repairs were more likely: if surgeons had larger inguinal hernia repair caseloads (\u2265 45/year; OR=1.57, CI=1.53-1.60, p\\0.0001), at large hospitals ([500 beds; OR=1.36, CI=1.33-1.39, p\\0.0001), and in New England (OR=2.38, CI=2.29-2.47, p\\0.0001). Likelihood of MIS was higher in patients\\age 65 (OR=1.28, CI=1.24-1.31, p\\0.0001), males (OR=1.31, CI=1.27-1.34, p\\0.0001), patients with private insurance (OR=1.36, CI=1.33-1.40, p\\0.0001) and those not White, Black or Hispanic (OR=1.11, CI=1.09-1.14, p\\0.0001). Likelihood of MIS decreased by 13% with a one-unit increase in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) value (OR=0.876, CI= 0.865-0.886, p\\0.0001). Non-predictors included urban/rural hospital location (OR=1.02, CI= 0.10-1.05, p=0.06) and hospital teaching status (OR=1.01, CI=0.99-1.03, p=0.2084). Conclusions: While the majority of inguinal hernia repairs are still open procedures, use of laparoscopic MIS is rising. Increased surgeon experience with inguinal hernia repair (higher annual caseload) remains a top predictor of MIS, along with hospital size and location. Additional study is necessary to understand links between patient age group, gender, race, insurance type and CCI as predictors of MIS for inguinal hernia repair.",

Methods and Procedures: An observational, retrospective and descriptive study was performed including 24 patients who were treated at The American British Cowdray Medical Center in Mexico City, from March 2013 to July 2015. We included patients that presented with unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia. Exclusion criteria were patients sustaining giant inguino-scrotal hernia, and patient refusing to undergo minilaparoscopic surgery. All patients signed an informed written consent. Mini-TAPP technique was used as the standard treatment in all cases. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon. Operative time, use of analgesics, time to discharge, complications, and conversion to standard 5 mm instruments or open surgery were registered. Prisma 6 Software. Results: Twenty four consecutive patients were operated at The ABC Medical Center in Mexico City. Mean age was 47.5 years (19-94 years). There were 16 males and 8 females. Seven patients presented with unilateral hernia, while 17 had bilateral disease. A total of 41 inguinal hernias were minilaparoscopically treated. Average operative time per hernia was 48.2 minutes (40-160 minutes, including bilateral procedures). Mean hospital stay was 26 hours (24-36 hours). Only one patient required the use of opiods in addition to ketorolac. There were no conversion to regular laparoscopy neither to open approach. There were no major surgical complications. Conclusions: Our results confirm that Mini-TAPP technique appears to be safe, simple and reproducible. It features advantages over standard laparoscopic surgery as it allows for better visualization, enhances dexterity and produces great cosmetic results. It might cause less pain and faster recovery since abdominal wall trauma is limited.

There are conflicting data on the influence of laparoscopic surgery on survival benefits. However, advantages of primary tumor resection by the laparoscopic surgery in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are still obscure. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of laparoscopic surgery with those of open surgery in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.Methods and Procedures: We retrospectively reviewed a total 149 consecutive stage IV patients who underwent primary tumor resection of colorectal cancer between January 2007 and December 2014. Results: The median duration of observation was 21\u00b123.4 months. The five-year overall survival rate was 12.1% in all patients with stage IV colorectal cancer, with median survival times of 23 months. Of 149 patients, 44 underwent laparoscopic surgery and 105 underwent open surgery. There were no deaths within 30 days after surgery in the laparoscopic group. Five patients (17.2%) in the laparoscopic group required conversion to open surgery because of bulky tumors. Seven patients (15.9%) in the laparoscopic group required conversion to open surgery because of bulky tumors. The five-year overall survival rate was 6.8% in the laparoscopic group and 14.5% in the open group, with median survival times of 30 and 21 months, respectively (P=0.22).

Objective: To share our therapeutic guidelines and surgical technique of LECS for gastroduodenal tumors. Subjects: Nineteen patients who underwent LECS for gastroduodenal tumors (10 patients with gastric tumor and 9 patients with duodenal tumor).[Results] 1) Gastric tumors (9 GIST, 1 glomus): 1. Site of lesion was U (4 patients), M (3), or L (2), 2. Operative procedure was acquired in a stepwise manner from classical LECS (4 patients) to inverted LECS (2) to non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery: NEWS (4). 3. Operative outcome revealed no postoperative complications. 2) Duodenal tumors (6 adenoma, 2 M cancer, 1 ectopic pancreas): 1. Site of lesion was bulbus duodeni (1 patient), superior part (2), or descending part (6); 2. Operative procedure was ESD followed by laparoscopic continuous suture in a single seromuscular layer for patients with preoperatively confirmed or suspected cancer, or full-thickness resection followed by Albert-Lembert suture along the short axis for patients unable to undergo ESD. In all cases, C-tube was placed to prevent bleeding and perforation at the site of resection due to exposure to bile; 3. Operative outcome included successful endoscopic hemostasis upon bleeding from exposed vessel on postoperative day 4 in 1 patient and anastomotic leak in 1 patient. The event of anastomotic leak resolved after 14 days of bile drainage through C-tube and conservative therapy. Compared with 26 patients who underwent ESD alone, those who underwent LECS had significantly larger diameters of resected specimens and tumors (p\\0.05) but no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative bleeding and delayed perforation. Conclusion: For gastroduodenal tumors, LECS is a minimally-invasive and safe therapeutic option as it combines advantages of both laparoscopy and endoscopy. In particular, C-tube placement for bile drainage was effective in reducing exposure of the suture site to bile as well as supporting drainage after anastomotic leak.",

            "text": "Introduction: In Japan, transurethral balloon catheters (TUC) are currently inserted in most surgical patients to maintain a urine outflow route and to measure the urine output both intraoperatively and postoperatively. However, TUC insertion not only causes postoperative pain but can also lead to urinary tract infections. Temporary suprapubic catheters (SPC) are used in the field of obstetrics and gynecology as a method of postoperative management to avoid performing transurethral procedures. In the field of surgery, especially in laparoscopic surgery, SPC also considered how it would be a useful way to reduce patient suffering. Here we report our prospective study on whether an SPC can be safely inserted as a substitute for TUC during laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. Subjects and Methods: The subjects in this study were patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for primary colorectal cancer from 2014 to 2015, and who would normally have had their urinary balloon catheter removed early after surgery. During surgery, an Angiomed cystostomy set was installed for patients who gave their consent to participate in this study as an alternative to a urinary balloon catheter. We prospectively collected patient information including sex and age, in addition to other perioperative data, such as, time required for cystostomy, complications accompanying cystostomy, sense of discomfort or pain associated with the vesical fistula after surgery, the time of the removal of the vesical fistula, the frequency of releasing the vesical fistula, postoperative complications. Results: Our subjects included 52 cases who gave their informed consent to have an SPC inserted. An SPC was inserted into the remaining 45 case. The mean surgical duration was 229 min, and the SPC insertion was performed at a mean of 137 min after the start of surgery. Insertion required a mean duration of 158.2 s. The bladder of one case (2.2%) was perforated, and hematuria was observed at the time of insertion in two cases (4.4%), but surgery completed without any incident. Six out of 42 cases (13.3%) demonstrated neither urinary urgency nor independent urination on the day the catheter was clamped. However, the clamp was released two to four times, and draining of an average of 586 mL urine, urinary urgency, and independent urination were confirmed 2-4 days later. Conclusion: SPC is a procedure that avoids crossing the urethra and its associated disadvantages. Here we were able to demonstrate that the procedure can be safely used in laparoscopic surgery patients.Our objective is to devise methods for proper port placement to overcome the ergonomic challenges. Procedure: 3 patients with SIT were operated laparoscopically in our hospital in the period of May 2016 to November 2017, 2 males suffering from cholelithiasis without cholecystitis and 1 female with acute appendicitis. After thorough review of literature and proper planning, the patients were posted for surgery. For laparoscopic appendectomy, a thorough initial diagnostic survey is performed on introducing a scope through the umbilical port and confirming the exact location of the appendix. The two working ports are introduced accordingly, which is usually a mirror image of the standard port sites. The appendix was visualised in the left iliac fossa and after meticulous dissection, the appendix and mesoappendix were divided using an endostapler. The operative time was 43 minutes and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications.The port placement for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in such a case is trickier as the anatomical variation and the contralateral disposition of the biliary tree demand an accurate dissection and exposure of the biliary structures to avoid iatrogenic injuries. It is important to conform to the principles of triangulation during port placement. The mirror image of 4-port placement is convenient for left-handed surgeons. Whereas, to make the procedure comfortable for right-handed surgeons, the working ports need to be shifted caudally with the surgeon standing between the patient's legs. The mean operative time was 54 minutes and there were no minor or major intraoperative or postoperative complications.Conclusion: Ergonomic comfort is vital to a smooth procedure. While mirroring ports suffices for appendectomy, all other procedures require forethought for port placement. It should be noted that ambidexterity is a desirable skill in the operating room for a laparoscopic surgeon.Priscila R Armijo, MD, Chun-Kai Huang, PhD, Gurteshwar Rana, MD, Dmitry Oleynikov, MD, Ka-Chun Siu, PhD; University of Nebraska Medical Center Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine how objectively-measured and self-reported fatigue of the upper-limb differ between laparoscopic and robotic surgical training environments. Methods: Surgeons at the 2016 SAGES Conference Learning Center, and at our institution were enrolled. Two surgical skills practical environments were utilized: 1) a laparoscopic training-box environment (FLS) and 2) the Mimic\u00ae dV-trainer (MIMIC). Two standardized surgical tasks were chosen for both environments: peg transfer, and needle passing. Each task was performed twice. Objective fatigue was evaluated by muscle activation and fatigue, and comparisons were made between FLS and MIMIC, for each surgical task. Muscle activation of the upper trapezius, anterior deltoid, flexor carpi radialis, and extensor digitorum were recorded during practice using surface electromyography (EMG; TrignoTM, Delsys, Inc., Boston, MA). The maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was obtained to normalize muscle effort as %MVC. The median frequency (MDF) was calculated to assess muscle fatigue. Subjective fatigue was self-reported by completing the validated 10-scale score Piper Fatigue Scale-12 (PFH-12) before and after practice. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS v23.0, with \u03b1=0.05. Results: This abstract represented the performance of 15 trainees (FLS: N=8, MIMIC: N=7) as part of larger cohort of the study. For peg transfer, EMG analysis revealed that MIMIC had a significant increase in mean muscle activation for the upper trapezius and anterior deltoid, both p\\ 0.001. Conversely, practice with FLS led to significantly more muscle fatigue than MIMIC for the same muscle groups (upper trapezius: p=0.028, anterior deltoid: p=0.015), represented by a significantly lower MDF. Similarly, for needle passing, MIMIC had a significant increase in mean muscle activation for the upper trapezius (p=0.034) and anterior deltoid (p=0.031), but practice with FLS significantly induced more muscle fatigue effort for anterior deltoid (p=0.004). Survey analysis revealed a significant decrease in self-reported fatigue after performing FLS tasks (before: 3.85\u00b11.66, after: 3.05\u00b11.54, p=0.044), but no difference after MIMIC tasks (before: 4.00\u00b12.27, after: 4.22\u00b12.56, p=0.417). Conclusions: Although different muscle groups are preferentially required in the performance of FLS and MIMIC, our analysis for both surgical tasks showed practice with MIMIC required more activation of shoulder muscles, whereas practice with FLS could lead more muscle fatigue for the same muscle groups. Interestingly, surgeons reported improved or no change in perceived fatigue after the tasks, despite of having an increase in muscular activation and effort. Subjective selfreport fatigue might not truly reflect the level of fatigue when trainees practice surgical tasks using FLS or MIMIC.",

            "text": "Objective: To investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries in bariatric surgeons around the world. Background: As the popularity of bariatric surgery increases, efforts into improving its patient safety and decreasing its invasiveness have also been on the rise. However, with this shift towards minimal invasiveness, surgeon ergonomic constraints have been imposed, with a recent report showing a 73-88% prevalence of physical complaints in surgeons performing laparoscopic surgeries. Methods: A web-based survey was designed and sent out to bariatric surgeons around the world. Participants were queried about professional background, primary practice setting, and various issues related to bariatric surgeries and MSK injuries. Results: There were 113 responses returned from surgeons from 34 countries around the world. 68.5% of the surgeons have had more than 10 years of experience in laparoscopic surgery, 65.8% in open and 0.9% in robotic surgery. 66% of participants reported that they have experienced some level of discomfort/pain attributed to surgical reasons, causing the case load to decrease in 27.2% of the surgeons. It was seen that the back was the most affected area in those performing open surgery, while shoulders and back were equally as affected in those performing laparoscopic, and the neck for those performing robotic, with 29.4% of the surgeons reporting that this pain has affected their task accuracy/surgical performance. A higher percentage of females than males reported pain in the neck, back and shoulder area when performing laparoscopic procedures. Supine positioning of patients evoked more discomfort in the wrists, while the French position caused more discomfort in the back region. Only 57.7% sought medical treatment for their MSK problem, of which 6.35% had to undergo surgery for their issue, and 55.6% of those felt that the treatment resolved their problem. Conclusion: MSK injuries and pain are a common occurrence among the population of bariatric surgeons, and has the ability to hinder performance at work. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate ways in which to improve ergonomics for these surgeons as to improve quality of life.Introduction: The use of robotic technology is rapidly increasing among general surgeons but is not being routinely taught in general surgery residency. We aimed to evaluate our first 100 robotic cases during which time we developed a robotic surgery curriculum incorporating residents. Methods: The first 100 robotic cases performed at our institution from 2016-2017 by two surgeons were analyzed. A residency curriculum was developed and instituted after the first 6 months. It consisted of online modules offered by Intuitive Surgical resulting in certification, simulator training, hands on workshops for cannula placement, docking, instrument exchange, camera clutching and other introductory tasks. Patient demographics, type of procedure, resident involvement, total operative and console times, comorbid conditions and complications were evaluated. Unpaired t tests were performed for statistical analysis. Results: 66 females and 34 males comprised this series with an average age of 44 years \u00b112. The majority of patients, 71% had comorbidities, with a predominance of hypertension, 59% and diabetes, 37%. The bariatric patients had an average BMI of 48\u00b110. A variety of procedures were performed including hernias, foregut and bariatric. Residents participated in 40% of cases. There were no differences in total operative and console times in cases with residents except bariatric procedures. There were 3 complications in this series; postoperative ileus, gallbladder fossa hematoma and an enterotomy. There was one early conversion to open in a complex foregut case and no deaths in this series.Conclusions: We report our initial experience of robotics in a variety of general surgery and complex foregut cases. The implementation of a robotic surgery program and residency curriculum was safe with similar outcomes related to operative times and complications. As MIS expands with the application of robotics in general surgery, residency curriculums will need to be revised. Further data is needed to determine residency learning curves between robotics and laparoscopy.Background: Robotic surgery has made a large impact in the fields of urology and gynecology. Its use is significantly increasing in the fields of general and bariatric surgery. Evidence remains unclear as to the clinical impact on outcomes, and significant questions remain as to the impact of cost. Our goal was to evaluate the economic impact of robotic surgeries in general and bariatric surgery at our institution. Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of minimally invasive general and bariatric procedures done at a single institution from January 2016 through June 2017. We performed a cost and reimbursement analysis of robotic versus conventional laparoscopic surgery. The cost evaluation included operative time, operating room costs, length of stay and overall hospital expenses. In addition, we looked at reimbursement and the contribution margin per cpt code. Results: Our study included a total of 1927 patients who underwent 1716 laparoscopic and 211 robot assisted general and bariatric surgeries. The average time duration for laparoscopic surgeries was 138 minutes vs 248 minutes for robot assisted. We performed a cost analysis which showed an average total cost of $8,955 for laparoscopic and an average of $15,319 for robot assisted. The total reimbursements were $19,631 for laparoscopic and $21,949 for robot assisted. This translated to an average contribution margin of $10,676 for laparoscopic vs $6,630 for robot assisted. For general surgery we found an average cost of laparoscopic $7,675 vs robot assisted $9,436, with a contribution margin of $7,761 laparoscopic vs $3,473 robot assisted. For bariatric surgeries we found an average contribution margin of $14,149 for laparoscopic vs $6,165 for robot assisted. Conclusions: Robotic surgery has been associated with higher costs and longer operative times. In this economic climate of increased cost awareness with institutions under increasing financial pressures, judicious use of resources becomes important when determining surgical approach. Although cost of robot assisted surgery may decrease with time, other quality factors may be important in patient selection. Although there is no clear evidence that institutions lose money with robot assisted surgery, in our experience the contribution margin is lower with robot assisted surgery as compared to conventional laparoscopy.Introduction: This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the new Senhance robotic system (Transenterix) for inguinal hernia repairs using the transabdominal preperitoneal approach. Our series is the first experience in the field of general surgery utilizing this new robotic platform. Methods: From March to September 2017, 76 inguinal hernia repairs in 64 patients were performed using the Senhance robotic system. The Senhance surgical system is a new robotic platform that consists of a cockpit, manipulator arm and a connection node (Figure 1 ). This new system provides robotic surgery with numerous advantages including eye-tracking camera control system, haptic feedback, reusable endoscopic instruments, and a high configuration versatility due to total independency of the manipulator arms. Patients were between 18 and 90 years of age, eligible for a laparoscopic procedure with general anesthesia, had no life-threatening disease with a life-expectancy of less than 12 month and a BMI \\ 40. A retrospective chart review was performed for a variety of pre-, peri-and postoperative data including but not limited to patient demographics, hernia characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative complications. Results: 54 male and 10 female patients were included in the study. Median age was 56.5 years (range 22-86 years), and median BMI was 25.9 (range 19.5-31.8 kg/m 2 ). Median docking time was 7 minutes (range 2-21 minutes), and median operative time was 48 minutes (range 18-142 minutes). Two cases were converted to standard laparoscopic surgery due to robot malfunction and intraoperative bleeding respectively. One patient developed a postop seroma that did not require any further intervention. Conclusion: We report the first series of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs using the new Senhance robotic system. Compared to previously published conventional laparoscopic or robotic TAPP hernia repairs these data suggest similar outcomes in operative time and perioperative complications. Additionally there was no significant learning curve detected due to its intuitive applicability. Therefor the Senhance robotic system can be safely and easily used for TAPP hernia repairs by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. This is a video presentation of 51 years old female, who presented with suprapubic pain and mass to Gynecology office. She has a history of robotic hysterectomy and sbladder sling operation 4 years ago. This was complicated with peritonitis and long ICU stay, due to what she was called ''bowel injury'' but treated only conservatively with antibiotics and subsequent abscess drainages at that time. She has occasional appearing nodule and pain at the left suprapubic region. CT ordered by Gynecology read as abdominal wall hernia with long sigmoid diverticuli in hernia. Also there was small amount of subcutaneous air at the tip of herniated diverticuli. After antibiotic treatment and improvement, colonoscopy shows, actually the diverticuli is the limb of the sling going through the simoid and anchored in subcutaneous fat on abdominal wall ahich represents clocutaneous fistula as gets infected. Clip was placed on sling and repeat imaging comfirmed that the localion of this sling fits to location of so called ''hernia'' The sling limb was resected robotically and colon was repaired with side stapling of clolonic wall. The abdominal wall defect is repaired with long term absorbable suture. As far as we have found, the presentation and treatment of this complication is unique and could not find a similar case to guide us for the plan. Background: Robot-assisted surgery using da Vinci Surgical System (DVSS) is thought to have many advantages over conventional laparoscopic surgery. It was reported that the use of the surgical robot might reduce surgery-related complications, then a multi-institutional historically controlled prospective cohort study on the feasibility, safety, effectiveness and economical efficiency of robotic gastrectomy (RG) for resectable gastric cancer was conducted in Japan. This study evaluated the safety of RG using DVSS Xi. Methods: This single-center, prospective phase II study included patients with resectable gastric cancer (UMIN000019366). The primary endpoint was the incidence of post-operative complications greater than Grade III according to Clavien-Dindo classification during one month after surgery. The secondary endpoints included all adverse events and completion rate of robotic surgery. Results: From Oct 2015 to Jan 2017, 22 patients were enrolled for this study. The incidence of post-operative complication greater than grade III was 0%. The overall incidence of adverse events was 18.1% (grade I; 13.6%, grade II; 4.5%). No patient required conversion to laparoscopic or open surgery; thus, the RG completion rate was 100%. Conclusion: This study suggested the introduction of RG using DVSS Xi for gastric cancer seems to be safe and feasible.",

            "text": "Priscila R Armijo, MD 1 , Dmitry Oleynikov, MD 1 , Sages Robotic Task Force* 2; 1 University of Nebraska Medical Center, 2 SAGES Robotic Task Force Introduction: While robotic companies continue to aggressively market and promote the use of robots in general surgery, little is known about how this technology is employed by general surgeons, and what is expected of this technology from both novice and experts in the field. The aim of this study is to evaluate the needs of general surgeons who are new to robotic surgery and the needs of established robotic surgeons. Methods: The SAGES Robotic Task Force Survey, a one-page survey, was designed and sent electronically to all SAGES members. Questions regarding fellowship training, area of expertise, robotic simulation and in clinical case use, services offered in the current hospital, mentorship, likelihood of switching to a different approach, and expectations for the robot were included in the survey. Two groups were created based on previous use of daVinci\u00ae System in a clinical scenario, or not. Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS v.23.0.0, using Fischer's exact and Pearson's chi-squared tests where appropriate. Results: 201 SAGES members answered the Survey. Surprisingly, 157 respondents (78%) had used the daVinci\u00ae in a clinical setting. Among these, 122 (78%) had additional fellowship training, compared to 27 (63%) in the non-clinical use group, p=0.048. Of all surgeons with additional fellowship training, the great majority (26%) had specialization in advanced GI, MIS and Bariatric Surgery, followed by Colorectal (10%). Most surgeons are performing less than 10 cases per month using the robotic System, and with the majority of cases performed using the platform being hernia repairs (24%), followed by foregut-related procedures (20%). Interestingly, from all the surgeons who replied the Survey, only 11.3% are planning to switch from open procedures to its robot counterpart, whereas 38.1% are planning to adopt robotic-assisted procedures rather than laparoscopy. Conclusions: The majority of SAGES members who responded to the survey have used the daVinci\u00ae in a clinical setting in the past. Surgeons who stated they perform mainly laparoscopic procedures were likely to continue to adopt robotic techniques, whereas those who perform open hernia repair for example were not very likely to switch to robotic approach. While the use of the robot may be enabling surgeons who used to perform mostly open procedures in the urology or gynecology fields, laparoscopic skills predict robotic utilization in general surgery. Hernia and foregut appear to be the most common procedures that are being utilized.Aim: While conventional multiport laparoscopic splenectomy has become gold standard for some hematological or splenic diseases, reduced-port laparoscopic splenectomy (RPLS) including singleincision laparoscopic splenectomy (SILS) is regarded as highly challenging. Herein, we describe the technical refinements for safe RPLS especially for patient with splenomegaly. Methods: In all cases, access was achieved via a 2.5-cm mini-laparotomy at the umbilicus into which a SILS TM Port or E-Z Access \u00ae with three 5-mm trocars was placed. A 5-mm flexible scope, an articulating grasper, and straight instruments were used. Our RPLS is characterized by the followings: a) early ligation of the splenic artery to shrink the spleen, b) application of our original \"tug exposure technique,\" which provides good exposure of the splenic hilum by retracting (tugging) the spleen with a cloth tape, and c) safe introduction of stapler under the guidance with a flat drain into the splenic hilum. Results: 27 RPLS patients (12 men and 15 women, 43\u00b119 years old) comprised hematological disorder (n=12), splenic disease (n=12), and liver cirrhosis (n=3). In 24 patients (89%), RPLS was successfully completed: SILS in 22 and SILS plus one additional port only in 2 patients. Conversion to open surgery was necessary in 3 patients including 1 liver cirrhosis with remarkable collateral varicose veins around the spleen. Operation time and blood loss were 214\u00b178 min and 166\u00b1312 g, respectively. Weight of the extracted spleen was heavier than normal and 341\u00b1286 g (maximum 960 g). No intra-or postoperative complication occurred. The postoperative scar was nearly invisible. Conclusions: RPLS might safely be performed even for splenomegaly (up to 1,000 g). However, care should be taken for cirrhotic patient with collateral veins. RPLS can be the procedure of choice even in the patients with splenomegaly and who are concerned about postoperative cosmesis. The aim of this feasibility study was to evaluate laparoscopic SN biopsy for laparoscopic SNNS in early gastric cancer patients. Subjects and Methods: This study includes 13 patients with cT1N0M0 (primary tumor \\4 cm) gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopic SN biopsy in conjunction with radioisotope and dye methods between Jan. 2010 and Jul. 2011. First, we looked for green-dyed SNs after injection of indocyanine green (ICG) without near-infrared light system, and then tried to detect the radioactivity of SNs using a hand-held gamma probe inserted through a small incision at the umbilical port. After the areas where SNs were distributed were resected, a gastrectomy with prophylactic lymphadenectomy was performed according to the gastric cancer treatment guidelines of the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. We looked for undetected SNs in the resected specimen at the back table. Results: Among 13 cases, there were 11 (85%) in which SNs were not detected in the resected specimen. There were 2 cases in whom SNs were detected in the resected specimen. In both cases, the primary tumors were located in the middle and greater curvature of the stomach. In Case 1, laparoscopic SN biopsy identified the left (4sb) and right (4d) greater-curvature lymph node (LNs) as SNs, however, lesser-curvature (3) and infrapyloric (6) LNs remained as SNs in the resected specimen. In Case 2, the left (4sb) and right (4d) greater-curvature LNs were identified as SNs intraoperatively, while the lesser-curvature (3) LN remained as an SN in the resected specimen. The SNs overlooked with laparoscopic SN biopsy method were detected by radioisotope only. No cases had LN metastasis, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate of these 13 patients was 100%. Conclusions: Our feasibility study of laparoscopic sentinel node biopsy for early gastric cancer showed that we should search for SNs of the lesser curvature carefully even if the primary lesion is located at the greater curvature.",
