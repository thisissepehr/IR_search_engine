            "text": "To measure the levels of access to continuing professional education (CPE) among the health workers, an index (continuing professional education access index: CEAI) was constructed. The CEAI is composed of six indicators: (i) availability of CPE; (ii) distribution of CPE; (iii) informational access; (iv) geographical access; (v) economic access; and (vi) preparedness to release staff. When developing the equation of the CEAI, these six component indicators were weighted in accordance with the order of importance reported by the earlier studies. To test its validity, the CEAI was applied to the CPE status in three regions of Ghana. The results of this application revealed that there was greater discrepancies in the CEAI values according to the type of health facilities. The type of health facilities with the greatest CEAI (=0.609) implying the best access to CPE was clinics while training/research institutes resulted in the lowest CEAI (=0.447). Regional variation among the three regions was not significant. A simple linear regression between CEAI and adjusted number of CPE opportunities per health worker produced an extremely high conformity in the model (R 2 = 0.960). This may indicate the validity of the proposed CEAI model to the large extent.",

            "text": "Currently we have several indicators for measuring 'access' that are internationally recognized: e.g., accesses to safe water, sanitation, and health services. Those indicators for 'access' are generally defined in terms of distance or time. However, some weaknesses, such as ambiguity of the definitions and limitations in addressing other important issues, have been detected. For instance, access to safe water, the most common and representative indicator for 'access' of the above three, is defined as 'In urban areas such a source may be a public fountain or standpipe located not more than 200 meters away and in rural areas access implies that members of the household do not have to spend a disproportionate part of the day fetching water' (World Bank, 1997; UNDP, 2002) . There is no global consensus on the criteria for what constitutes 'a disproportionate part of the day' in place. For this reason, a number of governments apply this definition to their countries by modifying it with their own original ideas and criteria. Subsequently, three factors (distance, time spent, and water quantity per capita) are optionally integrated to formulate these country-specific definitions (WHO, 1996) . This situation creates considerable limitations on data analysis due to its low level of comparability (Aiga and Umenai, 2003) . Furthermore, several important aspects such as physical availability of water and people's capacity to use water are missing (Lawrence et al., 2002) . For this reason, a British interdisciplinary researcher group has recently developed the Water Poverty Index (WPI) to address access to safe water more comprehensively (Sullivan, 2002) . Thus, taking access to safe water as an example, the concept of 'access' as an indicator has not been clearly and sufficiently defined.",

In this study, I employed the MOH's definition of governmental health workers: i.e. all types of occupational group working as either permanent or contracted full-time employees of the MOH. The survey was conducted between June and July 1997, by visiting every health facility located in the three regions and using a selfadministered questionnaire. The questionnaire forms were fieldchecked and locally collected during the survey team's visit. Those who were on short leave or otherwise temporarily absent were requested to fill out the form and to send it back to the survey team.

A study among nurses in the United States revealed that 'readily available programs' were the most facilitating factor in accessing and gaining CPE (Glass and Todd-Atkinson, 1999) . On the other hand, since CPE does not carry assurance that desired changes in competence or performance has occurred (Houle, 1981) , the budget for CPE is vulnerable to being cut (Aiga and Banta, 2003) . Subsequently, scarce and unstable budgeting for CPE (WHO, 1990a; Ohno, 1989) affects sustainable availability of CPE. Thus, the level of availability and sustainability of CPE is one of the components that characterize access to CPE. The most precise way of measuring availability is the proportion of total number of persondays covered by CPE per year to total number of health workers. However, the number of days for a CPE program varies by type or subject of the programs. Therefore, to measure access to one CPE program, total number of person-CPE-opportunities is more appropriate:",

Under the employer-driven CPE scheme, specific groups sometimes need to be given more CPE opportunities (e.g. managerial staff under the health reform) than the others. However, one of the missions of health services in public sectors is to deliver a homogeneously appropriate quality of services to local population. From this viewpoint, it is indispensable to ensure more equal distribution of CPE opportunities to comprehensively upgrade health workers' knowledge and skills. The studies in Eritrea and Ghana illustrated how CPE opportunities were unequally distributed (Ahmed and Hagos, 1993; Aiga and Kuroiwa, 2005) . Thus, the way in which CPE opportunities are distributed importantly regulates access to CPE among health workers.

In developed countries, physicians and dentists generally can be easily reached with updated mailing lists by CPE providers compared with other occupational groups (Adelson et al., 1985) . On the other hand, nurses, for example in the United States, considered the lack of information concerning programs to be a deterring factor in accessing and gaining CPE (Glass and Todd-Atkinson, 1999) . To transmit the message to the appropriate target groups, CPE providers should use a series of well-defined marketing strategies to promote and communicate the value of the program being planned (Adelson et al., 1985) . When being funded as staff development by the governments, target groups can be identified through internal administrative channels such as personnel database. The information necessary to be disseminated should include: topic; date; location; qualification for participation; and tuition fee. There are a number of ways in which the information is delivered to health workers, e.g. internet, e-mail, post mail, journal advertisement, bulletin board at duty station, and suggestion from supervisors and employers. In many developed countries, information concerning programs being MEASURING ACCESS TO CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION IN GHANA planned within the countries is available through internet (Peterson, 1999) while it is not in most developing countries.

Geographical access to CPE is an important factor that characterizes costing time and money on traveling to the venue (Boissoneau, 1980; Adelson et al., 1985) . For this reason, location of duty station was one of the determinants of CPE opportunities in the study in Eritrea (Ahmed and Hagos, 1993) and in the United State (Bowan and O'Donnell, 1985; Glass and Todd-Atkinson, 1999) . Several studies reported that the effects of distance CPE programs based on broadcast or internet are comparable to those of traditional classroom-based CPE (Umble et al., 2000; Wiecha and Barrie, 2002) . However, those CPE modes are available predominantly for health workers practicing in rural areas of developed countries such as the United States and Australia and their effects are not thoroughly discussed but include several questionable aspects (Candy, 2000) . Therefore, the distance between duty stations and the major cities where the majority of CPE programs are implemented is an appropriate way of measuring geographical access. However, the precise distance on the road network is not available in some countries. In such an occasion, distance from the nearest village, town or city to one major city, where CPE programs are often implemented (e.g. provincial capital or national capital), should be replaced. Given that longer distance to venues of CPE programs reduces access, geographical access to CPE (X 4 ) is calculated as follows by using a relative distance based on the technique for availability of CPE: Where, D: Distance from duty stations to a major city where CPE programs are implemented (ffi Distance in national and regional road network from the district capitals of the duty stations to the regional capitals). All the participants in focus group discussions agreed that venues of CPE program should be close to their duty stations. Adelson et al. (1985) reported that the location of CPE programs preferably should be within 'driving distance' in the United States. However, the use of private vehicles as transport means is not uniformly applicable to other countries. In the United States, where private vehicles are one of the major transport means for commutation, business, and leisure, the number of vehicles per 1000 people is the highest (=765) in the world (world average = 122). On the other hand, that in Ghana (=8) is lower than Sub-Sahara Africa (=23), and even low-income countries (=12) (World Bank, 2003) . Moreover, only 3.0% of households in Ghana, most probably the better off, possess private vehicle(s) (GSS and MII, 1999) . The level of punctuality and reliability of public transport in Ghana is not comparable to those in developed countries. Given these situations, I was unable to determine a unified MEASURING ACCESS TO CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION IN GHANA maximum distance (D max ) in km applicable globally. Therefore, I tentatively adopted 368 km, a maximum value detected in the survey for our study, as a value of D max :",

Even though a program is scheduled in convenient location and time, it would not be accessible if the tuition is either extremely high or totally non-reimbursable. For instance, a study in the United States found that the amount of tuition the third most important factors for deciding to apply for programs among physicians and nurses in 1980 (Houle, 1981; Adelson et al., 1985) . Another recent study in the country reported that tuition cost was the most deterring factor and tuition reimbursement was the forth most facilitating factor in CPE (Glass and Todd-Atkinson, 1999) . This implies that who covers the tuition cost remains critical at least for two decades in the United States. A study in Japan targeting public health nurses reported that the tuition cost for CPE programs attended by only 57.8% of participants in the past five years were covered by their employers (Ohno, 1997) . The ways of sharing tuition cost varies from full reimbursement and partial reimbursement (primarily by employers) to full payment by participants (Schoen and Morgan, 1993) . In developing countries where private commercial sector seldom provides CPE programs, the participants are generally paid per diem and accommodation costs, primarily by the governments. When being funded by development agencies, the amount of payment becomes extraordinarily substantial. In Mozambique, one development agency paid the equivalent of 18 months' salary to health professionals participating in a three-week provincial workshop. In Togo, four development agencies gave the participants in CPE program payment for subsistence support (Bryce et al., 1993) . In those countries, there is an emerging risk that CPE is considered to be a tool for extra income opportunity (Aiga and Banta, 2003) . Thus, the variation HIROTSUGU AIGA 462 of economic access is significant. For enabling us to make even international comparison in the future, economic access to CPE (X 5 ) is defined as the mean of reimbursement ratio of total tuition cost:",

In particular, availability factor (X 1 ), which produced the largest value for clinics, is emphasized compared with other component indicators. This is because the largest weight, accounting for 25.0% (=5.4/ 21.6 \u00b7 100), was assigned to availability (X 1 ) at the designing stage of the CEAI formula due to its highest level of importance in comparison with others based on the past studies (Eq. 1.2). In preparedness to release staff (X 6 ), a higher value tends to be produced for duty stations with a fewer number of staff due to its definition (Eq. 7.3). In addition, the mean of total number of staff at clinics (=4.30) is the least of all the types of duty stations, followed by maternity homes (=5.50). For these reasons, a higher value of preparedness to release staff (X 6 ) (=0.394) is produced as to clinic as well as maternity home. Note that hospitals with the highest informational access (X 3 ) produced the second lowest CEAI value, followed by training/research institutes. The health workers at hospitals were offered relatively less CPE opportunities in effect (0.333 times per health worker per annum) than health workers at other types of duty stations: e.g. 0.686 times per health worker per annum at clinics (Figure 3) . Moreover, hospitals have the greatest number of staff (mean = 130.5) of all types of duty stations. These findings suggest the crucial needs for a systematic dissemination of what have been learned, within hospitals through internally arranged CPE or on-the-jobtraining (OJT), to those who did not participate in CPE.",

This may indicate that the validity of the CEAI model is ensured to the large extent. However, further examination of the CEAI model is necessary to assess the validity and improve the quality of the index by applying the cases of other countries to the model. The definitions of each component indicators and weighing may need to be reconsidered. The component indicators need to be measured in reasonable and efficient way for measuring them on a sustainable basis to monitor the change of access to CPE among health workers. In this respect, of the indicators I adopted for this study, those except for two indicators (preparedness to release staff to CPE (X 6 ) and distribution of CPE opportunities (X 2 )) are assumed to be calculated using data that are either reported from health facilities or collected through budgeting system and other internal channels within ministries of health.
