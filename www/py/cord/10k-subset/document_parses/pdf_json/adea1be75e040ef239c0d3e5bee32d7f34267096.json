Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved survival rates in compliant HIV patients and reversible severe respiratory failure may warrant ECMO in this group. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) involves excessive inflammatory response to a pathogen with paradoxical clinical deterioration following HAART initiation and may present as severe respiratory failure. Patients with IRIS supported on ECMO have been infrequently reported in literature. We report two HIV-positive patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome from IRIS necessitating successful veno-venous ECMO as salvage therapy.",

            "text": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is accepted as salvage therapy in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure who fail to respond to conventional mechanical ventilation. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is the most common presenting manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in these patients is associated with an 18-fold increase in mortality despite the use of antiretroviral therapy [1] . ECMO support in immunosuppressed patients with opportunistic infections is associated with higher mortality and has been traditionally considered a relative contraindication. Immunocompromised patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have an overall 6-month survival of only 30% and immunosuppression is considered an independent risk factor for mortality in prognostic scoring systems used for respiratory failure in ECMO [2, 3] . ECMO support for refractory respiratory failure in HIV-infected patients during PCP treatment has been reported in the literature with limited success. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a clinical entity describing a paradoxical clinical deterioration after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-positive patients [4] . IRIS is a potentially reversible clinical condition where 25% of patients require hospitalization and increased resources; however, good clinical recovery is noted in patients given adequate supportive therapy [5] . Although IRIS is associated with a wide variety of infections, those precipitated by Mycobacterium spp, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) or pulmonary cryptococcosis can present with severe respiratory failure and refractory hypoxemia [6] .",

Initial CD4 counts were 44 cells/mm 3 and HIV viral load 912,011 copies/ml. He was diagnosed clinically to have PCP and was discharged on combination antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir) and a 3-week course of per-oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SFX). Three weeks later, he returned complaining of progressive shortness of breath and severely restricted effort tolerance, dry cough and poor appetite. He became progressively hypoxemic in the ward and needed intubation and mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory failure. His gas exchange did not improve despite proning and muscle relaxation; so was placed on veno-venous ECMO. Blood gases taken prior to initiation of ECMO showed severe respiratory acidosis (pH 6.97, pCO 2 87 mmHg, pO 2 149 mmHg) on tidal volume of 6 ml/kg, PEEP of 15 mmHg, FiO 2 of 1 and respiratory rate of 25/min. He was initiated on ECMO with a Medos DP3 pumphead and 7000 LT oxygenator with a 22 F inflow cannula in the right femoral vein and 24 F multistage outflow cannula in the left femoral vein. He was treated with meropenem, azithromycin, oseltamivir, ganciclovir and hydrocortisone in addition to his antiretroviral drugs and TMP-SFX.",

He subsequently required an additional 20 F cannula in the right internal jugular vein as the initial configuration could achieve only 2.6 l/min flows with inadequate oxygenation. Flows improved subsequently to 4.3 l/min and oxygen saturation was maintained above 85%. His anti-PCP therapy was changed to intravenous pentamidine.

Mortality in patients with PCP pneumonia who required mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory failure improved from 10 to 40% with the adjuvant use of steroids; however, low CD4 cell counts on hospital admission and development of pneumothorax on mechanical ventilation remained significant predictors of mortality in ICU [7] . With the advent of HAART, the life expectancy of HIV patients has improved significantly and thereby their eligibility for extracorporeal life support has changed in recent years [8] . Patients receiving HAART are at risk of a unique set of complications including paradoxical immunoreconstitution which results in restored capacity of the host to mount an inflammatory response against persistent microbial antigens or self-antigens, resulting in worsening clinical symptoms in these patients [6] . There is no universally agreed-on definition for IRIS; however, most or all of the following features should be present to prompt clinical suspicion: (1) a temporal association between HAART initiation and the onset of clinical features of illness, (2) a positive virologic and immunological response to ART (3) presence of clinical manifestations consistent with an inflammatory condition, (4) absence of evidence of drug-resistant infection, bacterial superinfection, drug allergy or other adverse drug reactions, patient noncompliance, or reduced drug levels due to drug-drug interactions or malabsorption after appropriate evaluation for the clinical presentation, (5) presence of AIDS with a low pre-treatment CD4 count (< 100 cells/\u00b5l) [4] [5] [6] .",
