Computational algorithms were initially demonstrated as useful tools for predicting potential epitopes that might elicit quality T-cell responses [1, 2] . Computational algorithms that predict potential HLA binding T-cell epitopes can facilitate the design of vaccines capable of inducing T-cell immunity against HIV-1. The high variability of HIV-1 and the extensive genetic polymorphism of HLA molecules can be managed in silico, allowing immunogen optimisation to increase breadth and magnitude of T cell responses in respect of HLA allele frequencies and circulating virus strains in different populations. Bioinformatics approaches were previously applied as proof of concept for an HIV-1 peptide-based vaccine for the env and gag genes [3] in cynomolgus macaques for a broad spectrum of HIV-1 clades. Computational optimisation of immunogens facilitates the development of the multivalent and mosaic vaccines [4] necessary to control recombinant HIV-1 strains, an increasingly common occurrence in the epidemic in Uganda [5] . Computational approaches aim to identify optimal epitopes relevant to vaccine development and are not isolated to HIV-1 only, but a wide range of pathogens, including Ebola virus [6] , therefore various statistical validation approaches have been applied for evaluation of these methods [7] [8] [9] [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 301, "end": 304, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 305, "end": 307, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 897, "end": 900, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1073, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1182, "end": 1185, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1370, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1475, "end": 1478, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1482, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1486, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1491, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "For HIV-1 vaccine design purposes an important consideration for the suitability of a computational algorithm is the breadth of discrete number of T-cell epitopes it generates that could reach particular levels of coverage [11] of circulating viruses.

This is an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm for predictions of 8-14aa and capable of predicting epitopes for other HLA alleles using data for similar alleles by positional similarity of residues in their binding motifs. NetMHCpan4.0 is considered to be the tool of choice for such predictions considering the benchmarking done against other related tools [24] . Nevertheless to have a conclusive outcome of the computational performance we compared NetMHCpan4.0 to both an older and recent tool, NetCTL1.2 [25] [26] [27] and MHCflurry1.2.0 [28] respectively. The binding of CTL epitopes to MHC class I molecules is linear, anchoring at residues 2 and 9; hence the interface between ligand and CTL can be determined computationally [29] . Validation of such computational applications can be done by comparing their predictions with suitable experimental data. Despite the paucity of data validating the performance of computational methods relative to wet laboratory experiments, a few have documented them to achieve an area under the curve AUC of over 90% [18, 19, 30, 31] by isolated experimental data. We have not come across a wet experiment that evaluated computational predictors to achieve a robust AUC using a single set of wet laboratory experimental data. The previously reported 90% AUC is largely based on positional specific scoring algorithms (PSSM) for the collective isolated experiments alongside probability models used to establish affinity or binding scores. One study that explored the reliability of in-silico approaches in epitope prediction and its application for vaccine design reported a meagre 22, 44%, and relatively higher 78% match for three computational tools namely YFPEITHI, CTLPRED and IEDB respectively [32] .

About one third (37) of 125 total positive predictions were not experimentally supported in our tests. These do not necessarily represent false positives, as ELISPOT detection depends on the frequency of specific T cells in the participant's repertoire, and we observed changes in dominant T cell specificities within a given participant between early and later time points after HIV-1 infection. A formal ROC evaluation of the score generated by NetMHCpan4.0 as a classifier for peptides recognised/not recognised by PBMC in IFNg ELISPOT assays, produced an AUC of 0.928. Thus experimental confirmatory tests cannot be dropped altogether, however the NetMHCpan4.0 algorithm could provide a considerable saving of time and resources in verifying just the predicted epitopes. As the participants had been enrolled in the acute/ early phase of HIV-1 infection and we had observed intra-participant changes in epitope recognition between early and late time points after infection, we compared the binding scores of confirmed epitopes at these time points and found a statistically significant change towards recognition of higher binding peptides as the infection entered the chronic phase.
