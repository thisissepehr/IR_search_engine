Since late 2003, wide-scale outbreaks of H5N1 influenza in poultry flocks in Asian countries have been recurring despite aggressive control measures, including the culling of more than 140 million poultry. The current unprecedented epizootic of avian influenza A (H5N1) in Asia is of concern because of its documented transmission to humans. To date, the WHO has confirmed over 115 human cases and over 59 deaths in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia, primarily in previously healthy children and young adults who The H5N1 virus is now endemic in poultry and expanding its avian host range and its geographical range to countries beyond Asia, possibly through wild migratory birds -historically the host reservoir of all influenza A viruses. The risk of further human cases will persist, as will opportunities for a pandemic virus to emerge. 1 With the virus now endemic in poultry and expanding its avian host range, averting a pandemic by totally eliminating further opportunities for human exposure no longer seems feasible. It is not known whether rapid intervention with case isolation, antiviral drugs and a vaccine if available, and rapidly implemented in the initial focus of human infection, would successfully interrupt transmission. Such a strategy would require a sensitive surveillance system and epidemiologic and laboratory capacity to provide an early detection of initial clusters.",
