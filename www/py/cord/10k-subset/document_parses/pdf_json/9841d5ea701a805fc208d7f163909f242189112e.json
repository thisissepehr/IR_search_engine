Two features of influenza make its spread difficult to control in hospitals. First, people with influenza are infectious 1-4 days before the onset of symptoms. Thus, they can spread the virus when they are still feeling well and are unaware of their own infectious state. Second, only about 50 % of infected persons develop classic influenza symptoms (CDC 2002 (CDC , 2003 Consequently, restricting healthcare workers with influenza-like symptoms from the workplace will not completely prevent transmission of influenza because healthcare workers with atypical symptoms could continue working and spreading the virus.

First, healthcare-associated infections affect about 2 million patients in US hospitals each year (Jarvis 1996). Second, there is a growing fear that hospitals could become a breeding ground for new strains of influenza such as the recent H1N1 influenza outbreak, the potential emergence of person-to-person transmission of avian flu, or other \"new viruses.\" Much as SARS spread widely in hospitals to begin the SARS epidemic in Toronto (Chowell et al. 2004) , person-to-person transmission of avian flu may start in hospitals as well, and, if a more lethal version of H1N1 were to develop, hospitals again could be a breeding ground for new infections. This last point is of particular salience. With the recent H1N1 outbreak and the subsequent work to develop a vaccine, controversies arose concerning which individuals to vaccinate first. Healthcare workers were high on the list. But, as we show below, not all healthcare workers are equal in terms of their importance in spreading infectious diseases.

There are at least two reasons for this assumption. First, if our subject is in close enough proximity to pass on the influenza virus to a second agent, the second agent is also within close enough proximity to pass on the influenza virus to our subject. Thus the ability to acquire or to pass on virus is a symmetric relationship. Second, the reader may note in the table that the matrix of observed contacts is not symmetric because of randomness in the observation of subjects. For instance one notices that the subject floor nurses were not observed to contact food service workers, but a small number of food service worker to floor nurse contacts were observed.

Human contact networks frequently have a small number of individuals with a much larger than average number of contacts, perhaps differing by orders of magnitude. These individuals are often called hubs. These hubs have the potential to significantly influence disease transmission because they are highly likely to be infected, and if so, to pass on infections to a large number of individuals. Because our sample includes approximately 2.5 % of the hospital worker population, we may be missing hubs in our sample if they exist in this setting. However, we note two things in relation to this: First, the relatively homogeneous workday responsibilities of workers within categories, likely limit the variation of contacts within a category. For instance two physicians or two floor nurses are likely constrained to see a relatively similar number of patients each day. This is unlike many other social network data sets, (such as general friendship or online networks) where there are not these work responsibility constraints on individual contacts. Thus the possibility of hubs with orders of magnitude differences in numbers of contacts is more limited in our data context. Second, our data set is more comprehensive than any other within hospital contact data set in existence in terms of the worker categories included. Recall from earlier in the paper that the Ueno and Masuda data set only includes physicians, nurses, and patients in a hospital much smaller than is studied here. Our results below suggest that many of the most important groups in the hospital are not included in their study.

From this baseline, we observe the rate of infection for each class of agents in the hospital population (15 worker groups and patients for a total of 16 groups).

Further, as expected, the number of infections generated monotonically increases as a function of the transmission rate, \u03b1. Our primary interest is in intermediate ranges of epidemic outbreaks. If the transmission rate is too high then almost everyone in a population needs to be vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity. And, if the transmission rate is too low, then there is not a large need to worry about vaccine priority. Thus, we concentrate on two intermediate levels of the transmission rate \u03b1 = 0.0030 and \u03b1 = 0.0035.

Somewhat surprisingly, some of the groups that are seen as central to the functioning of a hospital play a very small or moderate role in spreading an infectious disease. Vaccinating staff physicians results in a lower than average decrease in infections. We revisit this result in our discussion of transmission rates later in the paper. Also of note, as one would expect, as the transmission rate increases, the probability of infection increases. But, this has the effect of making individual vaccinations less beneficial on average. Note that\u00c2 k is smaller for each group for a higher transmission rate. This has the effect of lowering the variance of average infections. For the \u03b1 = 0.0030 case above the standard deviation is 1.79, and for the \u03b1 = 0.0035 case, the standard deviation is 1.41. As the transmission rate increases, a larger fraction of individuals are infected throughout the population. Thus there are more opportunities for each individual to be infected if she has not already been infected. Vaccinating a given person in the population will only prevent one of these multiple channels for infection. So, as the infection rate increases, the effectiveness of a vaccination becomes more uniform across the groups. This has direct policy applications. An infectious disease that is highly contagious could best be met with a uniform vaccination strategy since each individual in the population will create a similar level of infections on average.

So, even if we vaccinate an entire group, this is a small number relative to the entire population.) Here, we see two interesting outcomes. First, we see that marginal infections for both Unit Clerks and Floor Nurses increase as more vaccinations are performed. For these two groups, each additional vaccination prevents a larger and larger number of infections.

Thus, it is always more beneficial to vaccinate one more unit clerk as opposed to a worker from another group (assuming transmission rates are equal). The second is that there is little difference between the average and the marginal effect of a vaccination for the other groups considered here. This second point can be interpreted as good news from a policy making perspective in the sense that the optimal allocation of vaccinations does not switch as more of a group is vaccinated. In other words it is not the case that Group A is the optimal group to target up to some vaccination percentage, after which Group B should be targeted. Switching such as that would indicate a much more complicated solution to the optimal vaccine allocation problem.

Third, we calculate the average value for each hospital worker group and report the result in the table below. This network variable is likely to be an indicator of importance for disease transmission in the network. If a hospital worker group has a high average betweenness value, then the nodes in this group are potentially important in passing infections on to other nodes as it plays a crucial role in location along many of the shortest paths between nodes in a network.

Each of these three plausibly important characteristics fail to display a meaningful relationship with the average or marginal infections generated. If we concentrate on the top three most important groups, some have relatively large numbers of contacts (unit clerks), although not the largest, while others have contacts significantly below the average (phlebotomists). Some have large numbers of patient contacts (phlebotomists) while others have some of the smallest number of patient contacts (unit clerks and social workers). One interesting thing that appears in the table is that phlebotomists have almost all of their contacts with patients and other phlebotomists. Thus the network position of phlebotomists, is in some sense, very similar to that of patients. Overall, what these observations imply is that there is not likely to be a simple relationship (or a small set of simple relationships) indicating which individuals are most important to vaccinate by looking at easily observed worker interaction patterns. Instead the relationship depends on the intricate and complex web of relationships that make up the entire contact network of the hospital. This is what is captured in the betweenness centrality measure. Betweenness measures the percentage of shortest paths in the entire network on which an agent is located. If we remove agents with high betweenness measures (by vaccinations) from the disease propagation network, we disrupt the flow of an epidemic.

Here, we consider two robustness checks to the results presented above. First, we discuss a comparison of the magnitude of the above described network effects and the effect of transmission rates on marginal infections for an interesting example group, staff physicians. Second, we do an additional set of experiments using an additional data set that includes observed repeated contacts. We perform these robustness checks for two main reasons: First, because of the job responsibilities of different worker groups, the different worker groups may have different transmission rates, durations of contacts, or frequency of contacts creating another source of heterogeneity in infections. As a few examples, a staff physician may be more likely to transmit an infection over the course of a patient exam that includes a series of physical contacts, compared to a nurse who has a brief arm's-length conversation with a hospital transporter. A floor nurse may have multiple interactions with the same patient during the course of the day. 9 We begin this analysis by varying the transmission rate of staff physicians. (Recall that staff physicians created a lower than average number of infections in our earlier model.) Again, this is primarily to account for the fact that physicians may have longer duration contacts with patients and the contacts may more frequently involve physical touch. We now assign a special transmission rate to staff physicians that we denote as \u03b1 p . This will be the transmission rate for any contact between a physician and another agent where one of the agents is infected. We use \u03b1 = 0.0030 for all other contacts in the population and vary \u03b1 p from \u03b1 p = 0.0030 and \u03b1 p = 0.0200.

For instance, we could re-weight our contact matrix. If we knew, for instance, that physician to patient contacts lasted twice as long as other pairs of contacts in the hospital worker population, we could re-weight each physician to patient contact by a factor of two. But note that, on average, this is equivalent to increasing the transmission probability by a factor of two because the expected number of new infections is the number of susceptible to infected contacts in a period multiplied by the transmission rate. A doubling of the number of contacts is equivalent to a doubling of the transmission rate. 10 Recall from our results above that when the transmission rates are equal the average secondary infections created by unit clerks are slightly greater than 8 and slightly greater than 1.5 for staff physicians. As we increase the transmission rate for staff physicians we see several things: First, as you would expect, the average infections for staff physicians increases. But the change is not large. For \u03b1 p = 0.0200 the average secondary infections created by staff physicians is 2.86, slightly less than a two-fold increase and still well below the level of average infections noted for unit clerks when the transmission rates are equal. For unit clerks, as \u03b1 p increases, the average infections of unit clerks drops rapidly. This occurs for at least two reasons: One is that unit clerks become less important relative to staff physicians as \u03b1 p increases. Another is that, as \u03b1 p increases, the overall infection rates increase, and as we reported earlier, this causes average infections to become more uniform across groups. Overall, the level of average infections between these two groups does not become similar until the \u03b1 p increases to about 0.0150, a five-fold increase in the staff physician transmission rate.

Further, as one would expect, groups that have more repeated contacts, such as all types of nurses, become more important. The important point though, is that the relative ranking of most of the groups changes very little. Of course this is partially due to there being relatively few repeated contacts in the data set.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 26, "end": 33, "text": "Table 7", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Heterogeneous transmission rates and repeated contacts"}, {"text": "Taking these two robustness checks in combination, they demonstrate two important things.

Generally, a hospital's primary goal is to restore or improve patient health. Thus prioritizing healthcare worker vaccinations so as to best protect patients may be a legitimate goal of a hospital. In other words hospital administrators may care about protecting patients from infection as much, or more, than they do about protecting the entire hospital population from infection. Of course these may be closely related goals. In addition, in a large scale epidemic, it may be of great importance to have a healthy staff of physicians to treat patients. Thus protecting physicians may be another important goal in vaccine priority within a hospital. In Tables 8 and 9 we display the same relationships as displayed in our initial results section above but this time only with regard to patient infections generated and staff physician infections generated, not infections in the entire hospital. In this analysis we see very similar results to the overall population results. Beginning with patients, the four groups (unit clerk, social worker, physical and occupational therapist, and phlebotomist) that played the most important role in transmitting to the hospital population as a whole also play an important role in their effect on patients specifically. However, we see some difference in the two groups of models. First, groups that have more direct patient contacts increase in importance. For instance, phlebotomists replace unit clerks as the most important group. Second new groups emerge as important for transmitting to patients. For instance, hospital transporters are among the top four groups in transmitting to patients but are significantly below the average in terms of transmissions to the general population. With this in mind it seems that giving vaccination priority to health care workers with direct patient contacts is more important for protecting patients than it is for protecting the general population, as one would expect. But still, some of the groups with the largest impact on infecting patients have few direct patient contacts (unit clerks and social workers, for example).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 690, "end": 704, "text": "Tables 8 and 9", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}], "section": "Protecting patients and physicians"}, {"text": "For staff physicians we see similar results.

Interestingly the most important groups to vaccinate tend to have heterogeneous contacts throughout the hospital. Groups such as social workers and unit clerks are very important to vaccinate even though they have been given low priority in past vaccine campaigns because of their relatively limited number of patient contacts. For instance, the CDC recommended in their Interim Influenza Vaccination Recommendations in 2004-2005 that influenza vaccine priority be given to \"health-care workers involved in direct patient care\" and further stated, \"Persons who are not included in one of the priority groups described above should be informed about the urgent vaccine supply situation and asked to forego or defer vaccination.\" This mismatch of scientific results and past policy decisions suggests that future research in this area is warranted especially when one considers the public health dangers associated with the emergence of avian flu, a more lethal version of swine flu, or recent dangers such as SARS. With that stated, we want to be careful to recognize that one reason to vaccinate primary care providers is to assure individuals are available to care for the sick. This important incentive is outside the scope of our model. The results of this paper lead to important public policy considerations. Specifically, hospital workers with a low probability of infection may be likely to ignore recommendations for vaccination even if they are central to the spread of an infectious disease. One way to increase the overall vaccination level is with a subsidy program. But, as the results in this paper show, not all hospital workers are equal in terms of the positive externality generated by a vaccination. Because of the heterogeneous contacts throughout the hospital, some workers are more important to the spread of an infectious disease than others. Thus if hospitals and other public health organizations want to efficiently distribute vaccines they need to target specific worker groups, perhaps by allocating subsidies, on the basis of discrepancies in probability of infection and marginal infections generated. This paper is the first to use specific micro-level contact data within a hospital to guide policy makers and public health officials in this endeavor.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "To be clear, these results are not meant to be specifically calibrated to measure the exact effect of vaccinations in these groups. Instead our hope is that the orderings of the hospital worker groups (which are robust across the parameters that we have explored) indicate where public health officials can effectively intervene in order to prevent widespread epidemics within hospitals. And these experiments reveal interesting and surprising groupings. Prior to this study, as quoted above, it had been argued that groups like unit clerks be excluded from influenza vaccine campaigns, in times of vaccine shortages, because of their minimal patient contacts.
