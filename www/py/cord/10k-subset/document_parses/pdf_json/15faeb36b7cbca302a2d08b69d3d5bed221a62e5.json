However, S. aureus might exhibit fluctuating blood culture positivity, labeled as \"the skip phenomenon\". Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of the skip phenomenon in a cohort of hospitalized patients with S. aureus bacteremia and to determine the associated clinical variables. Methods We conducted a nested case-control study, using a previous cohort of 757 adult inpatients between July 2006 and June 2011 with \u2265 3 days of S. aureus bacteremia. Each case of S. aureus bacteremia with the skip phenomenon was matched to 2 to 4 controls based on age, gender, and duration of bacteremia. The association of clinical characteristics with the skip phenomenon was analyzed via conditional logistic regression. Results Of the 757 patients in the cohort, 29 (4%) had the skip phenomenon. 26 (90%) patients in the cases group were male. The median age was 69.4 years (interquartile range [IQR] 58.7 to 80.3). Although an attempt to match for the duration of bacteremia was done, there was a statistically longer duration in patients with cases as compared to that in controls (median [IQR], 10 [7-12] days, vs 8 [6-10] days; P = 0.015). Accordingly, duration of bacteremia was adjusted for in regression models. Notably, 26 (90%) patients in the case group were receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy, as compared to 69 (79%) patients in the control group (P = 0.427).

The latest Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections suggest that a single set of negative blood cultures is sufficient to demonstrate clearance of bacteremia [2] . However, our anecdotal experiences in which bacteremia cleared and then recurred, despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy, suggested that S. aureus might exhibit fluctuating blood culture positivity, labeled as \"the skip phenomenon\". Multiple studies of S. aureus bacteremia have addressed questions of treatment failure, relapse, and recurrence, although the definition of these terms has varied from study to study [3, 4] . Few smaller and older subsets of 1 3 studies have described \"breakthrough bacteremia\", which refers to continuous or new-onset bacteremia whilst receiving appropriate antibiotics against the microorganism recovered in the blood cultures [5] . Breakthrough bacteremia may seem similar to the skip phenomenon; however, it is defined based solely on the presence of positive blood cultures while receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy and does not require previous documentation of blood culture clearance, which is the hallmark of the skip phenomenon. The skip phenomenon may be a distinct clinical entity that could have significant clinical implications related to treatment, prognosis, and healthcare resource utilization for patients with S. aureus bacteremia.

Given the importance of establishing the timing of blood culture clearance, awareness of the skip phenomenon may have clinical implications. In our study, we examined multiple candidate risk factors and only prolonged duration of bacteremia reached statistical significance. This finding is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated a higher risk of recurrence in patients with a longer duration of bacteremia. Several covariates (tobacco use, chronic immunosuppression, and active malignancy) were present in higher proportions in patients with skip phenomenon bacteremia and trended towards statistical significance.
