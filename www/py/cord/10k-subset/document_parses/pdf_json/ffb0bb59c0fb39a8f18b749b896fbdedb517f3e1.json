However, subcutaneous tissue and muscle edema and inflammation, frequently observed in the critically ill, can make the grey-scale analysis difficult to interpret.

US evaluation of critically ill patients at the bedside has been largely adopted by intensivists because it is easily available, non-expensive and non-invasive and it can be used as a monitoring tool during the ICU stay. Therefore, besides its large indications in cardiovascular or respiratory management, it has also often been described to evaluate limb muscle and diaphragm mass in weak patients during the ICU stay [7, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Very few US studies have however focused on parameters that reflect muscle quality. In a landmark study, Puthucheary et al. critically ill patients that changes in vastus intermedius but not rectus femoris echogenicity over time were correlated with physical function tests collected at ICU awakening and at ICU discharge [28] . Beyond quantitative analysis of the muscle mass, non-invasive tools are urgently needed to provide measurable parameters of limb and respiratory muscle quality. Real-time nonvolitional tools, available at the bedside such as SWE, would provide targets for clinical trials aiming at improving quality of life and autonomy in survivors of critical illness [33] . Because different pathologic and healthy tissues reveal a similar echogenicity pattern and similar grey-scale but different shear modulus values, sonoelastographic techniques such as SWE measurement might be a promising tool to evaluate and to monitor muscle quality and in vivo contractile property changes over time [27, 34] . For instance, high shear modulus is associated with muscle stiffness in cerebral palsy or in late Duchenne's myopathy [35] , while low shear modulus is associated with atrophy in a GNE chronic myopathy [22] .

Nowadays, since specific phrenic nerve stimulation tools to explore critical illness-associated diaphragm weakness are not routinely available at the bedside [4, 12] (and diaphragmatic biopsies are very difficult to obtain in humans [5, 39, 40] ), non-invasive tools to explore the diaphragm using US is more and more popular. US may help by approximating diaphragm mass by measuring Fig. 3 Bland-Altman plot of the difference of shear modulus between operators in healthy subjects thickness as well as approximating diaphragm contractile activity by measuring the excursion and the thickening fraction [41] . A pioneer study by Goligher has reported that during critical illness and mechanical ventilation, the diaphragm thickness may decrease (supposedly because of atrophy), but may not change during the stay or may increase (supposedly because of myotrauma) [30, 42] . Since diaphragmatic shear modulus has been associated with diaphragmatic function in spontaneously breathing volunteers [43] , shear modulus analysis of the diaphragm in the critically ill may pave the way towards a non-invasive better understanding of diaphragm quality changes during critical illness. Our study presents limits that should be discussed. First, we did not perform muscle biopsies to correlate shear modulus to pathology. However, most of the studies that have evaluated SWE in muscles did not show pathology data either [27, 34] . Second, precautions must be taken into consideration when shear modulus is measured. Position of the patient, muscle contraction and pressure applied to the muscle by the probe do indeed influence the shear modulus value [27, 34, 44] . We therefore took extreme precautions to limit any measurement bias and used an excessive amount of gel, did not apply any pressure to the muscle during the evaluation and used triplicates to calculate the mean shear modulus. We also paid extra attention to measure the shear modulus in muscles with no contractions and at the end of the expiration for the diaphragm. In the healthy controls, we report a diaphragm shear modulus above the range observed by Bachasson et al. [23] . Two main differences should be noted between the two studies. We performed the measurements in the supine position rather than the semi-recumbent position which may have impaired the diaphragm to completely relax at the end of the expiration. We designed the present study as a real-life bedside study and did not use a pneumotachograph or a transdiaphragmatic pressure monitoring. Therefore, even after taking extra precautions to measure the shear modulus at the end of expiration with no diaphragm contraction, it is possible that some of the measurements were performed above the functional residual capacity. However, because both intra-operator reliability and inter-operator reproducibility ICC were very high, our results suggest that shear wave elastography is a feasible technique to describe diaphragm ultrastructure. Diaphragm biopsies using critically ill animal models may help assessing the accuracy of the shear wave elastography technique in phenotyping diaphragm weakness. To limit the influence of muscle anisotropy on the measured value, we chose to use a large square as the region of interest to measure the signal. Third, we used shear modulus measurement rather than shear wave velocity. All commercially available US elastography systems are based on the prerequisite assumption that the material is elastic, incompressible, homogenous and isotropic, with a density which equals 1 g/cm 3 .
