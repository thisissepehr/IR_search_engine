            "text": "Random networks with specified degree distributions have been proposed as realistic models of population structure, yet the problem of dynamically modeling SIR-type epidemics in random networks remains complex. I resolve this dilemma by showing how the SIR dynamics can be modeled with a system of three nonlinear ODE's. The method makes use of the probability generating function (PGF) formalism for representing the degree distribution of a random network and makes use of network-centric quantities such as the number of edges in a well-defined category rather than node-centric quantities such as the number of infecteds or susceptibles. The PGF provides a simple means of translating between network and node-centric variables and determining the epidemic incidence at any time. The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the evolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The equations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree distribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with which it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are observed to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller final size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson. The equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement with the theory. Finally, the dynamic equations provide an alternative way of determining the epidemic threshold where large-scale epidemics are expected to occur, and below which epidemic behavior is limited to finite-sized outbreaks.",

Compartment models can capture many aspects of population heterogeneity, such as with respect to heterogeneous susceptibility and infectiousness [1, 9, 32] , however such models usually assume individuals mix homogeneously within each category. In contrast, the contact patterns responsible for the spread of many infectious diseases tend to be characterized by constant relationships marked by high levels of heterogeneity in the number of contacts per individual.",

This approach has generated a new category of epidemiological models in which epidemics spread from node to node by traversing network connections [2, 8, 17, 19, 24, 25, 29, 30, 33] . Random networks with specified degree distributions have been proposed as a simple but realistic models of population structure. This case has the advantage of being well understood mathematically. The expected final size of epidemics in random networks with a given degree distribution has been solved exactly [19, 24] . The network approach has the advantage that the mathematics of stochastic branching processes [4, 15, 34] can be brought to bear on the problem.

At first, this goal may seem incompatible with network-SIR dynamics described in the previous section. Infection spreads along links in a random network, which implies the epidemic incidence at any time as well as the final size must also be random, depending on the particular structure of a given random network. This is true, however it is possible to avoid such considerations by focusing on epidemic dynamics in the limit as population size goes to infinity. This strategy has been used in previous work to calculate the expected final size of epidemics in infinite random networks [24] expressed as a fraction of the total population size. A similar strategy is followed here by considering the fraction of nodes in sets S, I, and R, after a small fraction nodes are infected initially in a susceptible population. 1 The conclusion is the system of equations given in Table 3 in terms of the dynamic variables given in Table 2 . The dynamics predicted by these equations are compared to stochastic simulations with large but finite networks in Sect. 3.1.",

Initially = 10 \u22124 nodes are infected. The parameters of the degree distributions were chosen so that each network has an identical average degree of 3. That is, the density of connections in each network is the same. Nevertheless, there is widely different epidemic behavior due to the different degree distributions. Consistent with previous research, the degree distribution has a great impact on the final size of the epidemic [19, 24] . More importantly, the three networks exhibit widely varying dynamical behavior. The power law network experiences epidemics which accelerate very rapidly. Such epidemics enter the expansion phase (the time at which cumulative incidence increases at its maximum rate) virtually as soon as the first individual in the network is infected. In contrast, the Poisson network experiences a lag before the expansion phase of the epidemic. The discrete exponential network has behavior similar to that of the power law but not as extreme; the expansion phase is early, but not instantaneous, and the final size is not as great as the power law. These observations are consistent with the findings in [5] that the timescale of epidemics shortens with increasing contact heterogeneity. This has important implications for intervention strategies, as it is often the case that interventions are planned and implemented only after a pathogen has circulated in the population for some time. If an epidemic were to occur in the power law network, there would be little time to react before the the infection had reached a large proportion of the population.",

Figure 4 shows the results of 450 simulations for the Poisson random network considered in the last section (z = 3) with 10 4 nodes. The black dotted line represents an independent simulation trajectory. The thick, solid line that cuts through the dense mass of simulation trajectories is the analytical trajectory based on the equations in Table 3 . The initial conditions were chosen as in the previous section using = 10 \u22124 . Figure 5 shows a similar series of simulations for the power law degree distribution considered in the last section. In both cases, the analytical trajectory traverses the region with the highest density of simulation trajectories. The simulation trajectories also exhibit significant variability in the time required to reach the expansion phase and final size. This is largely due to the significant impact of random events early on in the epidemic. For example, an initial infected with a low average degree, or one which takes an inordinate amount of time to infect the next infected can markedly delay the onset of the expansion phase. Figure 6 shows the median-time incidence for the exponential and Poisson networks discussed in the last section. The data points show the median time required to reach a given cumulative incidence among 450 simulation trajectories. The solid line shows the analytical trajectory based on the system of equations given in Table 3 . Intuitively, the data points are showing the path of the most central trajectory from the swarm of simulation trajectories such as in Fig. 4 .",
