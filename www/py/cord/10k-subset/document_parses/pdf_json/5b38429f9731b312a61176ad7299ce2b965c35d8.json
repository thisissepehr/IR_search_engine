The Bayes factor (BF) measures the relative support, from the observed evidence, for two hypotheses: (Probability of the data given the null hypothesis)/(Probability of the data given the alternative hypothesis). The BF modifies the prior probability to give the posterior probability of the null hypothesis (or, if one reverses the numerator and denominator, the post-study probability that there is a true association: positive predictive value (PPV)). One can calculate, from the same numbers used to calculate the P value, the minimum BF: the strongest evidence against the null hypothesis, using the best supported hypothesis (the observed association) as the alternative-hypothesis [11] .
