Next, we observed that male C57BL/6 mice treated with C23 (8 mg/kg BW) at 2 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) had lower serum levels of LDH, ALT, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 (reduced by \u226539%) at 20 h after CLP compared with mice treated with vehicle. C23-treated mice also had improved lung histology, less TUNEL-positive cells, lower serum levels of creatinine (34%) and BUN (26%), and lower kidney expression of NGAL (50%) and KIM-1 (86%). C23-treated mice also had reduced lung and kidney levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. E-selectin and ICAM-1 mRNA was significantly lower in C23-treated mice.

Further evaluation showed that the renal mRNA expression of NGAL and KIM-1 was increased by 305.9-and 53.2-fold in vehicle-treated mice compared with sham-operated mice (Fig. 6C,D) . The renal expression of renal injury markers NGAL and KIM-1, however, was reduced by 50% and 86% in mice treated with C23 as opposed to vehicle (Fig. 6C,D) . Collectively, these data show that C23 is able to attenuate sepsis-induced AKI. Next, we assessed proinflammatory cytokine levels in kidneys collected 20 h after CLP. The kidney levels of IL-6 were 2.9-fold higher in vehicle-treated mice than in sham-operated mice (Table 2) . Conversely, kidney levels of IL-6 were 41.2% lower in C23-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice ( Table 2 ). Kidney levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also increased in vehicle-treated mice (2.9-and 2.6-fold, respectively), and there was a statistical trend for lower kidney levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in C23-treated mice ( Table 2 ).

In spite of this intense search, effective anti-sepsis therapeutic strategies beyond antibiotics and supportive care are yet to be approved by the FDA. We have recently discovered that extracellular CIRP is a key mediator of injury and inflammation in preclinical models of sepsis and shock 18 . Serum levels of CIRP were further found to be elevated in septic patients and to be predictive of sepsis severity (APACHE II and SOFA scores), renal injury, and overall mortality 19 . Accordingly, we have hypothesized that CIRP inhibition would attenuate sepsis severity and mortality. Indeed, in the present study, we observed that sepsis treatment with the CIRP inhibitor C23 reduced systemic, pulmonary, and renal injury and inflammation. CIRP is a 172-amino acid nuclear protein which regulates RNA translation [33] [34] [35] . CIRP is constitutively expressed in most tissues at low levels 33, 36, 37 . Cellular stressors such as hypothermia 15, 38 , hypoxia 14 , oxidative stress 16 , and radiation 34,39-41 , upregulate CIRP expression, induce its translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, promote its uptake by stress granules, and cause its release 16, 34 . Once in the extracellular space, CIRP promotes the activation of vascular endothelial cells and the release of proinflammatory mediators by macrophages 18, 20, 42, 43 . Indeed, rats treated with CIRP-neutralizing antibodies and mice genetically deficient in CIRP have decreased injury, decreased inflammation, and increased survival after CLP 13, 18 . We have also discovered that extracellular CIRP plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of lung injury.

C23's affinity for the TLR4/MD2 complex was one order of magnitude higher than that of CIRP, and two orders of magnitude higher than that of LPS or HMGB1 29 . Indeed, pre-incubation with C23 prevented rmCIRP-induced release of TNF-\u03b1 from the human monocyte THP-1 cell line 18 , confirming that C23 is able to inhibit CIRP's activity. We here showed that C23 inhibits CIRP-induced TNF-\u03b1 release (dose-dependently), I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, and NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation.

In fact, C23 attenuation of the inflammasome may have also directly contributed to lower serum and tissue levels of IL-1\u03b2 20 . In this study, C23 also decreased the levels of creatinine, BUN, NGAL, and KIM-1, all of which are increased during sepsis-associated AKI [54] [55] [56] [57] .

Indeed, a computational modeling suggests that C23 displaces CIRP by docking into an MD2 pocket that is not a binding site for LPS (unpublished observations; W.-L. Yang and P. Wang).
