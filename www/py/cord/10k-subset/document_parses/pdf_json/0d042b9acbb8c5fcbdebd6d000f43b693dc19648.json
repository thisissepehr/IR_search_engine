For whom should knowledge serve? In our time, the highly active landscape of knowledge production via publication, with widespread immediate interconnectivity of scholars around the world allows for the making of a stronger intellectual community. It can be argued that this one of many impacts of globalization, in that academics are more interconnected than ever before, just as world economies, geopolitics, and global media. Moreover, the scholars who present new knowledges or make visible alternative knowledges come from a wider range of backgrounds than ever before, including non-white/Euro-descendant racial and ethnic groups, working class people, all genders, all sexualities, and non-Western nations. Beyond that, scholars are engaging with a broader body of research subjects and ideas that can transform society in exciting ways.",

Consequently, these hierarchies function in ways that afford the greatest access to resources, including research funding, salaries, and facilities, to a relatively small population of the world. Those who are affiliated with more elite and generally Western institutions are the ones who have the greatest access to publications and intellectual work housed behind paywalls.

However, there are over 4,000 institutions of higher education across the country and its territories, such as Puerto Rico and Guam.

These include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); public, comprehensive regional universities; small liberal arts colleges; women's colleges; Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs); Tribal Colleges and Universities; and community colleges. Each type of institution has a very specific history and community associated with them. With theoretical and empirical roots throughout the twentieth century, Black geographies has gained attention as a necessary intervention in the discipline, particularly over the last two decades (Darden 1990; Gilmore 2007; Finney 2014; Bledsoe, Eaves, and Publications are the currency of the academic profession. Regardless of level or status within the academic realm -undergraduate to faculty -producing publications provides professional credibility and establishes one's reputation. Even now, there are secondary school programs that encourage student research and its accompanying publication output. In the United States, there is increasing favorability for prospective graduate students who apply to programs while having an established publication profile. And in the increasingly tight and competitive job market for tenure-track (semi-permanent and permanent) faculty positions across this country, even at colleges and universities that place a heavier emphasis on being a good teacher, the stress to incorporate research publications into candidate materials is ever increasing. Regarding teachingintensive institutions, those whose research profile is generally lower, peer-reviewed publications on the practice of teaching are increasingly more common, contributing to more knowledge production filling our journals. The role of publications as the currency of academia, particularly related to high levels of productivity -the expectation of multiple publications in any one academic term or year -is undoubtedly crucial.",

There is no remuneration for journal publishing. Articles and other forms of writing are submitted through and reviewed by a mostly unpaid labor system, which financially benefits the journal and its hosting body (O'Loughlin and Sidaway 2020). The Editors went further, pointing towards the use of public funds through college and university subscriptions as a primary funding source for publishers (The Editors 2019). Scholarly work is accessed by limited audiences, due to the constraints of holdings, as discussed earlier in this paper, and individual funds access. Meaning, public access to publications is inhibited by the pay-per-view model of article acquisition, which benefits privileged individuals and corporate bodies who are able to pay for the access. As MacLeavy, et.al. (2019) and The Editors (2019) detail, exceptions to the unpaid labor standard are primarily reflected in editorship and production, while maintaining higher profit margins for publishers.",

What difference does it make if you cannot access the contemporary and ongoing developments in research and teaching practices that are situated in the conversation about paywalls? Given the demands of the academic profession, the publication industry is unlikely to disappear any time soon. However, the range of concerns raised in and beyond this paper pushes for naming paywalls as a form of power within which academics have to negotiate. Since we have a wide range of sources available for our view, we have an opportunity to consider the transformation of public knowledge if paywalls are removed. Widespread open access publishing would bring about a more just distribution of knowledge within the United States and globally.",

            "text": "For example, HBCU are institutions established prior to the mid-twentieth century in order to address the educational needs of African Americans in the United States. HBCUs were established due to the injustices of American higher education created by legal segregation, structural oppression, and violence against Black people in the country (Bracey 2017). Most HBCUs were founded by formerly enslaved people and/or churches and maintain strong links to Black people and communities throughout the country. Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) largely originate in the second half of the twentieth century, with the first -Navajo Community College, now Din\u00e9 College -having been founded in 1968 (Stein 2009). Prior to this point, efforts to educate the Indigenous peoples were violent and pushed for assimilation into white settler society. These institutions are situated on or near Native American/American Indian reservations, lands designated by the United States government for American Indian nations to occupy. These reservations represent the failure of the colonizing U.S. government to honor Native sovereignty and of the unwillingness to relinquish stolen Indigenous land. I bring this variety of institutions to a conversation about open access publishing for a variety of reasons. Most importantly, the foci and historical communities for HBCUs and TCUs are embedded in elevating culture while providing a strong education. They are often, though, vastly under-resourced, particularly with respect to state and federal funding mechanisms in the country. In fact, Tribal Colleges and Universities rely on funding from the federal government under the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act of 1978 with strict restrictions for its use. Ultimately, the funding and resources impacts library holdings, which are the major hosting body for journal and database subscriptions. Campus communities across the range of institution types I discussed earlier are actively engaged in geographic research and praxis. However, the limits of the institution impact the ways scholars can be engaged with a wide range of current research, debates, and practices. Understanding the disparities in funding and resources across the wide array of higher education institutions in the United States allows for seeing how structural barriers to publication access takes shape. Another perspective of how to think through the uneven landscapes created by paywalls is to think about how open access publishing can broaden participation in recent disciplinary transformations. Highly regarded epistemological frames, such as Black geographies (Woods 1998; Wilson 2000; McKittrick 2006; McKittrick and Woods 2007), Latinx geographies (Mu\u00f1oz and Ybarra 2019; Cahuas 2019; Ramirez 2020), and queer and trans geographies (Johnston 2015; Rosenberg and Oswin 2015; Di Pietro 2016; Ellison 2019), have begun to gain traction in mainstream geography after having operated in pockets of the discipline, Black geographies in particular. Here, I want to discuss the importance of Black geographies as an option for understanding how removing paywalls can contribute to justice-oriented concerns.",

            "text": "Wright 2019; Ellison 2019). Addressing the racial undergirding of space and place has offered new perspectives on environmental and social concerns for geographers and nongeographers alike. At the center of Black geographies is not a categorical interrogation of race but instead is a de-centering of the hegemonic concerns and priorities of Eurocentric geographic approaches and the addition of critiquing the role of anti-Blackness in global societies. Black geographies scholarship is engaged directly in understanding the forms of expression and ways of knowing for Black subjects creating Black spaces. The ways that Black subjects understand and negotiate space is fundamental for the discipline. Publications behind a paywall are broadly inaccessible to the individuals and communities at the very center of Black geographies scholarship and, therefore, perpetuate barriers to dismantling hegemonic forms of knowledge production that are circulated through elite, predominantly Western circuits. The relations that are built from researcher to community as well as the documentation of relations within and attendant to Black spaces are indicative of the ways in which networks are built and maintained in the research process. Many of us who are Black, Indigenous and Persons of Color (BIPOC) scholars are outward facing and thinking about how we can maintain our individual opportunities as scholars with our practices of being situated in community. Liberatory practice of Black geographies means that what we do is necessary for evening out the landscape of publishing. One final important perspective to consider about debates in open publishing has to do with who does the labor of academic publishing in the first place (The Editors 2019).",
