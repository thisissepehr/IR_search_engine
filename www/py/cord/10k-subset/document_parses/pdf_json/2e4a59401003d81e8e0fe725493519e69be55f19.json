Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a major role in innate immune responses to allergens and viruses 2,3 and may also recognize components of dying cells 4 . Rhinoviruses produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during replication, which is recognized by PRRs notably Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors 5 . The result of activation of these PRRs involves the production and release of interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, which induces an antiviral state in surrounding cells 6 . It has been shown that primary cells from asthmatics may have a deficient ability to produce IFN-\u03b2 at rhinoviral infection and dsRNA stimulation, the latter representing a given viral infection burden 7, 8 . IFN-\u03b2 is a multipurpose cytokine. In addition to its antiviral properties it can both induce cell death and, by contrast, promote cell survival in various cell types 9, 10 . However, little is known regarding any association between IFN-\u03b2 deficiency and occurrence of cell death in asthma or experimental models of asthma.",

A variety of cells in the asthmatic airways, including granulocytes and epithelial cells, may undergo necrosis at asthma exacerbations [12] [13] [14] . However, it is not known what modes of cell necrosis are involved. Eosinophil necrosis is clearly regulated in part by factors previously mistaken to specifically indicate apoptosis in these cells 15 . Apoptosis is a form of regulated cell death controlled by caspases and required for many physiological processes 16 . Apoptosis can be induced from extrinsic signals such as activators of cell surface death receptors or PRRs including TLR-3 17 . Once the initiator caspases get activated they cleave and activate caspase-3, which will execute apoptosis by proteolytic cleavage of several proteins including Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) involved in DNA repair 18 . If apoptotic cells are not phagocytosed they will undergo necrosis, which has been denominated as 'secondary necrosis' . Necrosis is clearly induced by physical trauma such as heat damage or hypoxia. However, of special interest in disease is well-regulated necrosis 19 . Different modes of regulated necrosis have now been identified: secondary necrosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis that all manifest with necrotic morphology 20 .",

Necroptosis involves the proteins receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-1, -3 and mixed linage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Upon activation, RIP1 and RIP3 form a complex called the necrosome, which phosphorylates MLKL to its active form that causes plasma membrane rupture. To avoid extensive necroptosis, the kinase activity of RIP1 and RIP3 is suppressed by full-length caspase-8 23 . Necroptosis has also been associated with inflammasome activation and subsequently interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 secretion and maturation 24, 25 .

            "text": "Increased expression of both apoptotic and necroptotic markers during viral stimulus-induced asthma exacerbation. Asthma exacerbations have been associated with increased cell death, but the mechanism leading to cell death is largely unknown. Since we found that allergic airway inflammation induced by HDM developed without pronounced involvement of apoptosis or necrosis we wanted to examine the occurrence of various molecular cell death markers during viral-induced asthma exacerbation. We used a previously established mouse model of experimental asthma exacerbation where two different doses of dsRNA as a viral mimic (50 \u03bcg, 100 \u03bcg) or saline control were given intranasally to mice with established HDM-induced airway inflammation 26 ( Figure S1 ). We found that exacerbation evoked by both doses of dsRNA increased the apoptotic markers cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP compared to HDM:saline challenged mice ( Fig. 2A,B) . Further, we found that both 50 \u03bcg and 100 \u03bcg dsRNA increased the expression of full-length caspase-8 (Fig. 2C ). The expression of the necroptotic effector proteins RIP3 and phosphorylated MLKL were also increased to a similar level with both doses of dsRNA (Fig. 2D ,E), indicating occurrence of necroptosis at exacerbation. Interferon-\u03b2 deficiency increases BALF LDH levels at dsRNA-induced asthma exacerbation in mice. Having examined the effects of dsRNA on mouse lungs previously challenged with HDM for three weeks as regards to cell death markers we next performed a study with 50 \u03bcg dsRNA that included mice deficient in IFN-\u03b2. There was a trend towards increased total cell count in BALF in wild-type mice at exacerbation compared to HDM:saline challenged wild-type mice (Fig. 3A) . There was also a higher total cell count in BALF at exacerbation compared to saline:dsRNA challenged wild-type mice, indicating that the combination of HDM and dsRNA produced an aggravated immune response (Fig. 3A) . Total cell count in IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had similar pattern as wild-type mice (Fig. 3A) . In wild type mice at exacerbation there was a higher percentage of neutrophils compared to HDM:saline challenged wild-type mice, while the percentage of eosinophils was similar between the two groups ( Figure S2B,D) . However, saline:dsRNA challenged IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 had higher percentage of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils compared to wild-type mice with the same treatment ( Figure S2B-D) . Furthermore, there was a shift towards an increase of the percentage of lymphocytes, in the IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice at exacerbation compared to wild-type mice at exacerbation ( Figure S2C ). Total protein and LDH levels in BALF in wild-type mice were increased at exacerbation compared HDM:saline challenged wild-type mice (Fig. 3B,C) . Similarly there were increased total protein and LDH release in BALF in IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice at exacerbation compared to IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice that where challenged with HDM:saline (Fig. 3B,C) . Strikingly, there were much higher levels of LDH in BALF at exacerbation in IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type mice, indicating occurrence of cell necrosis (Fig. 3C ). This was accompanied by increased gene expression of IL-1\u03b2 at exacerbation in IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type mice at exacerbation (Fig. 3D) . H&E staining showed a trend towards increased perivascular recruitment of immune cells in wild-type mice close to large airways at exacerbation compared to both HDM:saline and saline:dsRNA challenged wild-type mice (Fig. 3E,F) . Tissue staining revealed comparable inflammation pattern in IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3E,G) .",

Furthermore, cell death indices at exacerbation were further increased in IFN-\u03b2 deficient mice; the most conspicuous observation being a marked increase in LDH release together with an index of necroptosis and increased gene expression of IL-1\u03b2.

HDM induced inflammation interacts with the viral stimulus dsRNA to produce robust and reproducible exacerbation features including increased necrosis as reflected by increased BALF levels of LDH 26 . By the present regimen, HDM produced an eosinophilic inflammation with no signs of cell death. These results suggest that allergic lung inflammation is not always associated with aggravated cell death response. This observation suited the present focus on exacerbation. However, it is acknowledged that authors employing other HDM regimens and cell culture studies have reported that HDM has capacity to evoke cell death 28, 29 including markers of epithelial cell apoptosis that were not increased in this study. The present viral stimulus, dsRNA, is employed as a rhinovirus infection intermediate known to mimic biological effects of actual infection 30, 31 . This study also reproduced central features of viral exacerbations reported previously and that agree with observations in human asthma including LDH release and mixed granulocyte and protein exudation features 11 . There is a further potential advantage with dsRNA challenges in exploratory studies comparing different interventions because it provides the opportunity of exposing the animals to a given pathogen burden. This goal may be difficult to achieve with actual infection, in particular when variations between animals in the antiviral response and pathogen resistance against virus occurs. We demonstrated that two different doses (50ug and 100ug) of dsRNA challenges, administered to animals with an established HDM-induced allergic condition, produced significant increases in lung indices of apoptosis, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, as well as necroptosis markers, RIP3, and pMLKL. These observations demonstrated involvement of regulated cell death in viral-induced exacerbations. The lower dose level of dsRNA (50ug) was therefore chosen for further studies of effects of dsRNA alone and for comparisons between wild-type mice and IFN-\u03b2 deficient animals regarding exacerbation features.",

Hence, it is not surprising that dsRNA increased LDH levels and markers of both apoptosis and necroptosis in wild-type mice in this study. Mice deficient in IFN-\u03b2 showed amplified levels of LDH and the necroptotic marker pMLKL at exacerbation compared to their wild type counterparts. Furthermore, there was also higher levels of LDH and the necroptotic marker pMLKL in IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice at exacerbation compared to saline:dsRNA challenged IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast, apoptotic markers were not altered in IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice at exacerbation. However, this finding may not exclude that secondary necrosis contributed to the high levels of LDH. A majority of apoptotic eosinophils in a model of severe asthma remained non-phagocytosed and underwent secondary necrosis, which along with direct cytolysis of eosinophils was associated with increased airway epithelial derangement and inflammation 35 . Our results suggest that virus in combination with allergy could lead to a more detrimental cell death response in those asthmatics with reduced IFN expression.",

Wild-type and IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice at exacerbation had similar pattern of TUNEL-positive cells. The TUNEL assay detects cells with fragmented DNA, and detects both apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells 36 . The TUNEL-positive cells were found in inflammatory foci, suggesting that they could be recruited inflammatory cells. Indeed, non-injurious resolution of inflammation in mucosal lined hollow organs such as the lungs is not dependent on apoptosis of inflammatory immune cells because the disease-driving cells in the airway wall are evidently eliminated through transmigration into the airway lumen for final clearance by mucociliary transport 37 . Shedding of epithelial cells is a hallmark of asthma likely contributing to pathogenesis of the disease. Especially large numbers of epithelial cells are shed at exacerbations. They appear in sputum and BALF as conglomerates called Creola bodies consisting of 10 cells or more including alive and dead cells 13 . However, it is of note that epithelial cells do not have to die before being shed but be released through down-regulation of adhesion proteins in intercellular junctions 38 .",

Based on the present findings we suggest a novel additional role of IFN-\u03b2 deficiency as a regulator of necrosis and necroptosis at exacerbation of asthma. How IFN-\u03b2 may affect cell death in context of asthma has previously been limited to observations in vitro, where IFN-\u03b2 was required for an apoptotic fate of viral-infected cells 7 . It has been reported that IFN-\u03b2 knockout mice had higher levels of cytokines potentially promoting necrotic cell death, including TNF-\u03b1 in central nervous system compared to wild-type mice 41 . Our results showed that the inflammation in wild-type mice and IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice was not much different at exacerbation at least at one specific time-point. Interestingly, we found that IFN-\u03b2 deficient mice challenged with three weeks of HDM had increased expression of pMLKL compared to wild-type. In contrast, the apoptotic markers were mainly induced by dsRNA in both wild-type and IFN-\u03b2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Hence, the inflammation induced by HDM in mice that are deficient in IFN-\u03b2 may have a dysfunctional tissue repair mechanism involving necroptosis, which might lead to a prolonged inflammation. The present finding thus provides a basis for future exploration of time course aspects of pathogenic factors emanating from necroptosis at asthma exacerbations. Future studies are also warranted to validate the present novel findings with dsRNA in experimental exacerbations involving HDM and live rhinovirus infections.",

This is the first paper to our knowledge that shows involvement of necroptosis and hence potential pathogenic cell death in asthma models. In COPD patients, elevated expression levels of RIP3 has been observed in lung epithelial cells compared to controls but pMLKL, considered the most appropriate marker of necroptosis, was not studied 20, 43 . Diseases that have been suggested to involve necroptosis have also increased incidence of other forms of necrosis. This may be expected because the cell death pathways, as reflected by currently employed molecular markers, are highly intertwined 44 . How much necroptosis and necrosis contribute individually to driving inflammation needs further studies. Similarly the present discovery of a novel role of IFN-\u03b2 as regulator of necrosis/necroptosis at viral induced exacerbations needs validation in future studies.",
