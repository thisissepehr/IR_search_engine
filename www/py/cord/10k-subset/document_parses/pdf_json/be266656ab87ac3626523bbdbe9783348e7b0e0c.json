            "text": "Epidemic threshold, which is one of the most important features of the epidemic dynamics, has attracted much attention recently. The existing studies have provided different theoretical predictions for epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on complex networks, while the numerical verification of these theoretical predictions is still lacking. As a result, it is very necessary to develop an effective numerical measure for identifying the SIR epidemic threshold. In this paper, the numerical identification of the SIR epidemic threshold is systematically studied. We present a numerical method by analyzing the peak of the epidemic variability to identify the epidemic threshold. To understand the effectiveness of the variability measure, the distribution of outbreaks sizes is investigated near the epidemic threshold on random regular networks. Based on the analysis of the cutoff hypothesis of the outbreak size distribution, we find that the variability measure can provide an excellent identification of the epidemic threshold. We further use the variability measure to verify the existing theoretical predictions on scale-free and real networks. The results show that the heterogeneous meanfield (HMF) prediction agrees very well with the numerical threshold, except the case that the networks are disassortative, in which the quenched mean-field (QMF) prediction is relatively close to the numerical threshold. The numerical method presented can effectively identify SIR epidemic thresholds on various networks, and could be extended to other dynamical processes such as information diffusion and behavior spreading. This work provides us a deep understanding of epidemic threshold and would promote further studies on phase transition of epidemic dynamics.",

At the same time, the infected nodes become susceptible again in the SIS model or recover in the SIR model with probability l. In the SIS model, a critical value of the effective transmission rate k \u00bc b=l separates the absorbing phase with only healthy nodes from the active phase with a stationary density of infected nodes. Differently, no steady state is allowed in the SIR model, but a threshold still exists above which the final fraction of recovered nodes is finite. 4 The traditional theoretical study on the epidemic threshold of the SIS model is based on the heterogeneous meanfield (HMF) theory, which means that all the nodes within a given degree are considered to be statistically equivalent. 5, 6 According to the HMF theory, the epidemic threshold of SIS model 7, 8 is given by k HMF c \u00bc hki hk 2 i , where hki and hk 2 i are the first and second moments of degree distribution P(k), 9 respectively. As the quenched structure of the network and dynamical correlations between the state of adjacent nodes is a) neglected in the HMF theory, 10 researchers have proposed an important improvement over the HMF theory-quenched mean-field (QMF) theory. The QMF theory fully preserves the actual quenched structure of the network described as its adjacency matrix, and the epidemic threshold is predicted to be [11] [12] [13] ",

However, the QMF result is even qualitatively not correct, as the QMF predicts a vanishing threshold for power-law distributed networks with c > 3 that is in conflict with the visually numerical results. 22 Although the numerical threshold of the SIS model has attracted much attention, [15] [16] [17] [18] the systematic study of the numerical identification of the SIR epidemic threshold is still insufficient. It is well known that the outbreak size becomes finite above the threshold k c . 21 However, as the value of k increases, the outbreak size continuously changes from an infinitesimal fraction to a finite fraction in the SIR model, 23 and thus, it is difficult to determine the value of k at which the outbreak size turns to be finite. To our knowledge, there has no effective numerical method for identifying the SIR epidemic threshold in previous studies. In this work, we perform extensive numerical simulations of the SIR model on networks with finite size, and present a numerical identification method by analyzing the peak of the epidemic variability 24,25 (i.e., the maximal value of the epidemic variability) to identify the epidemic threshold. The effectiveness of the numerical measure is checked on random regular networks (RRN), where the HMF theory is exact. To get a deep understanding of the validity of the numerical method, we investigate the distribution of outbreaks sizes near the epidemic threshold. The robustness of the variability measure is confirmed by the analysis of cutoff hypothesis of the outbreak size distribution. We further employ the variability measure to verify the theoretical predictions on scale-free networks and real-world networks, where the results indicate that the HMF prediction agrees very well with the numerical threshold, except the case that the networks are disassortative, in which the QMF prediction is relatively close to the numerical threshold.",

On RRN with different values of k, we find that k D p is always consistent with the HMF prediction. When the degree k is given, we further consider the relationship between the epidemic threshold and the network size N in Fig. 1(b) , where the numerical thresholds k v p and k D p do not change with N. k D p is very close to the HMF prediction, while there is an obvious gap between k v p and HMF prediction. From the above, we know that the variability D can identify an effective SIR epidemic threshold, while the epidemic threshold identified by the susceptibility v is overestimated on RRN. Thus, a new problem has arisen: Why the variability D performs well but the susceptibility v goes awry for the SIR model?",

Analysis of the effectiveness of numerical identification measure Next, we make an analysis of the effectiveness of the numerical identification measures above, by investigating the distribution of outbreak sizes which has the strong heterogeneity near the epidemic threshold. On RRN with k \u00bc 10, where the epidemic threshold k c \u00bc 1=\u00f0k \u00c0 1\u00de \u00bc 1=9, Fig.  2(a) shows the distribution of outbreak sizes near k c . The outbreak sizes follow approximately an exponential distribution at k \u00bc 0:1 that is smaller than k c . At k \u00bc k c , the outbreak sizes follow a power-law distribution P\u00f0q\u00de $ q a with a cutoff at some values, where a ' \u00c01:5. [28] [29] [30] Since the disease may die out quickly or infect a subset of nodes when k > k c , the distribution of outbreak sizes is bimodal, 31, 32 with two peaks occurring at q \u00bc 1=N and q ' 0:2 for k \u00bc 0:12, respectively. Moreover, the theoretical distribution of outbreak sizes (see Appendix for details) is compared with the results obtained by numerical simulations in Fig. 2(a) , where the theoretical probability from Eq. (A4) is consistent with the numerical results for relatively small outbreak sizes (q < 0:05). At the epidemic threshold, the theoretical results also show that the outbreak sizes obey a power-law distribution with the exponent of about \u00c01.5. When k > k c , some large outbreak sizes constitute a lump in the numerical scattergram, but the probability of large outbreak sizes cannot be solved from Eq. (A4). We thus speculate that the nonignorable lump may affect the numerical identification of SIR epidemic threshold for the susceptibility measure.",

We set the cutoff value of the outbreak size as r c , which means that only the outbreak sizes with q r c are used to numerically count the susceptibility v under the cutoff hypothesis. Three kinds of r c are considered, where r c \u00bc 0:05 corresponds to the maximum value of small outbreak size before the lump appears in the numerical scattergram, r c \u00bc 0:2 means that the numerical scattergram consists of a part of the lump, and r c \u00bc 0:4 means that there is a complete lump in the numerical scattergram. As shown in Fig. 2(b) , the susceptibility measure can indeed give a quite effective estimate of the SIR epidemic threshold when the whole lump is ignored (i.e., r c \u00bc 0:05). With the increase of r c , the position of peak value of susceptibility v gradually shifts to the right for large outbreak sizes are considered.

Differently, the degreedegree correlations vanish on scale-free networks with structural off, while the disassortative degree-degree correlations exist when c < 3 for scale-free networks with natural cutoff, 33 because high degree vertices connect preferably to low degree ones in this case. We consider the SIR model on SFN with structural cutoff in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c) , where the SIR epidemic threshold increases monotonically with the degree exponent c, and the variation of epidemic threshold with network size N is approximately linear in logarithmic relationship. 16 The HMF prediction k HMF c is very close to the numerical threshold k D p , while there is an obvious difference between the QMF prediction k QMF c and k D p . The SFN with natural cutoff are considered in Figs. 3(b)  and 3(d) , where the variations of epidemic threshold with c and N are similar to the results on SFN with structural cutoff. When c > 3, the HMF prediction is close to the numerical threshold, while there is a gap between the QMF prediction and the numerical threshold.

The numerical results intuitively show that the variability D always reaches a maximum value near the value of k above which the outbreak size q becomes finite.

Considering the difference in the behaviors of the theoretical predictions on the two networks above, the detailed comparisons between the numerical and theoretical thresholds on other real networks are presented in Table I . The results indicate that although the HMF prediction and the numerical threshold k D p \u00f0SIR\u00de are nearly the same for assortative networks, there is an obvious difference between them for the networks showing significant disassortative mixing.

The outbreak sizes follow approximately an exponential distribution when k < k c . At the epidemic threshold, the outbreak sizes follow a power-law distribution with the exponent of about \u00c01.5. When k > k c , the numerical distribution of outbreak sizes is bimodal with two peaks occurring at q \u00bc 1=N and O(1), respectively. The probability of small outbreak sizes in theory is consistent with that obtained by numerical simulations, but the probability of large outbreak sizes that constitute a lump in the numerical scattergram cannot be obtained theoretically. Based on the analysis of the cutoff hypothesis of the outbreak size distribution, we found that the susceptibility measure can give a fairly effective SIR epidemic threshold when the lump is ignored. Since the variability measure reflects the heterogeneity of the outbreak size distribution, it is always effective in identifying the epidemic threshold, where the distribution of outbreak sizes has the very strong heterogeneity.",

The HMF prediction is close to the numerical threshold on most of the networks, but on SFN with natural cutoff and degree exponent c < 5=2, it becomes poor due to the existence of disassortative mixing. Similarly, the HMF prediction agrees well with the numerical method on real networks with assortative mixing, while it becomes very poor for disassortative networks, where the QMF prediction is relatively close to the numerical threshold. These findings provide quantitive indexes for the accuracies of existing theoretical predictions from the perspective of simulation.",

As shown in the inset, l ! 0 leads to an epidemic threshold close to Eq. (4), while l ! 1 leads to an epidemic threshold close to Eq. (3). It should be pointed out that the numerical threshold of SIR model is inclined to the theoretical prediction k c \u00bc hki hk 2 i\u00fe\u00f0l\u00c02\u00dehki from the edge-based compartmental theory 43, 44 when 0 < l < 1.

As shown in Fig. 6 and Table I , the numerical threshold k D p from the variability measure agrees very well with the threshold k v p identified by the susceptibility measure, whose validity for the SIS model has been confirmed in Ref. 18 . This shows that the variability measure can also provide an effective estimate of the SIS epidemic threshold.",

In this framework, the distribution of occupied cluster sizes is related to the distribution of outbreak sizes. To get the distribution of small outbreak sizes in the SIR model with a fixed value of k when recovery rate l \u00bc 1, we will present the derivation of the distribution of small occupied cluster sizes in bond percolation with bond occupation probability k. 21 After the percolation process on a general network with arbitrary degree distribution p k , the average degree of the occupied network A 1 , which composes of vertices and occupied edges, is hk T i \u00bc khki, where hki is the average degree of the original network A 0 . And, the size distribution of the small subgraphs of network A 1 iswhere s is the small subgraphs size and g 1 \u00f0z\u00de is the generating function of the excess degree of network A 1 . In addition, the generating function of degree distribution of A 1 isand we thus haveIn a random regular network, which has an unique degree k with p k \u00bc 1, we can easily obtain thatandSubstituting Eq. (A3) into Eq. (A1), we can obtain the distribution of small outbreak sizeswhere C\u00f0x \u00fe 1\u00de \u00bc x!; a 0 \u00bc \u00f0s \u00c0 2\u00de; a 1 \u00bc s\u00f0k \u00c0 1\u00de \u00c0 \u00f0s \u00c0 1\u00de, and a 2 \u00bc s\u00f0k \u00c0 1\u00de \u00c0 1.",
