However, it is usual that patients have symptoms compatible to asthma for months or even years before the right diagnosis. At that time the disease may already be m a persistent stage. Biopsy studies have shown that significant inflnmmatirm is present in early asthma, also m paticnts with only a short duration of symptoms, or with mild disease. But the relation of this inflnmmation to the disturbances of lung function, and ppedicly to increased bronchial responsiveness, is not straight forward. Transient eosinophjlic idlammation of the bronchial mcosa may be quite common especially m atopic subjects, but it is fir from elways causing deterioration on lung hetion. It may be argued that the diagnosis is h y s late, if asthma with mcrcascd bronchinl responsiveness is detected.",

The eosinophilic inflnmmation (bronchitis) is detected at earlier stages, and even before functional deterioration is observed For early diagnosis new methods are emergjng, and biochemical characterization of the bronchial inflammation fom sputum, serum, urine samples or exhaled air may be on reach. A widened view of asthma, including also those with asthma-like symptoms, would improve early detection and guide to the right type of interventions. This should influence the outcome, and may even prevent the patient to have overt asthma. Today, most patients with prolonged mucus production and cough, but with normal lung function, are treated with anti%iotics, and with everything else but adequate anti-innammatory therapy.",

            "text": "The intestinal mucosa is an important organ of defence providing a barrier against the antigens encountered by the enteric route. Apart from the barrier function, the intestinal mucosa is efficient in assimilating antigens. Intestinal antigen handling determines subsequent immune response to the antigen. To explore the intestine's barrier function and antigen transfer across the intestinal mumsa in patients with atopic dermatitis, the absorption and degradation of horseradish peroxidase ( HRP, molecular weight 40 000) were studied in vie0 in Ussing chambers. Eighteen biopsy samples of upper small intestinal mucosa from 14 patients (aged 0.5-8 years) with atopic dermatitis and 18 samples from 15 age-matched controls were examined. The mean (95 % confidence interval) absorption of intact IiRP was significantly higher in children with atopic dermatitis than in conaols: 242 (81-404) pmol . h-1 . cm-* as against 23 (12-33); p=0.007. The absorption of degraded HRP was 972 (732-1213) pmol . h-' . cm-2 in patients with atopic dermatitis and 672 (532-81 1) in controls; fl.03. To assess the mucosal effector responses induced by doubleblind placebo-controlled cow milk challenge in infants w i t h atopic dermatitis, the concentrations of turnour necrosis factor-c-(TNF-a), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and a-1 antihypsin in faeces as indicators of intestinal inflammation were determined. An increased 0-1 antitrypsin concentration was detected in 43% of the infants positive as compared to 11% of those negative to challenge, p= 0.02. An elevated concentration of ECP in faeces was associated with immediate-type mctions to the cow milk challenge, while TNF-a in faeces was associated w i t h delayed-type reactions to the challenge. Impaired barrier function and defective handling of antigens in the epithelial cells may be an important pathogenetic mechanism in atopic dermatitis. Aberrant antigen transport in the gut may initiate and perpetuate inflammatory response to the most important source of allergens early in life, i.e. diet. These results suggests that the ueatment of atopic dermatitis should counteract the mechanisms that enhance intestinal innammation. References 1. Majamaa H, Isolauri E.

At least 40% of asthmatics do not react appropriately to increasiiig asthma symptoms and more than half of the patients admittcd with acute asthma have had alarming asthma symptoms for one wcek prior to admission. In its study of deaths due to asthma in the early 1980s the British Thoracic Association rccommended that patients should measure thcir own pcak flow ratcs and treat deteriorating symptoms themselves. Guided asthma self management consists of efficient patient education and of symptom-and/or peak expiratory flow-bascd patient instructions in early asthma deteriorations. Several studies have shown that educational progrmmes of asthma both increase the patient's skill and improve the general outcome of asthma carc. Although self management practices have been suggested in several asthma guidelines, somewhat conflicting results exits concerning the efficacy of this treatment. Some of the self management studies have been either uncontrolled or have relied on retrospective data analysis. In a recent study (BUT 1996 ;312:748-52) we have compared the efficacy of guided self management of asthma with trational trcatmcnt. This onc year trial of 115 patients with mild to moderately seven disease randomised half of the patients to a traditional asthma care and half to a self management programme consisting 01 education about asthma and daily peak flow readings. The mean number of unscheduled visits to ambulatory care, days off work, and courses of antibiotics and prcdnisolonc per patient were lower in the self-management group than in thc traditionally trcatcd group (0.5 V.S. 1.0, p=0.04; 2.8 V.S. 4.8, p=0.02; 0.4 V.S. 0.9, p=0.009 and 0.4 V.S. 1.0, p=0.006, rcspcctively). In both groups hospitalisations due to asthma were rare and the spirometric values remained completely stable at the schedule visits. One year self management had a superior effec (8 quality of life points, 95% CI 2-15 points) on quality on life compared to traditional treatment. The self mangement was 4.5% more effective @< 0.0001) than the trational treatment in terms of healthy days (defined as day without incidents caused by asthma). Thc dircct health care costs were FIM 649 greater @=0.05) in the self management group, mainly due to the greater costs of counselling. The self management, however, resu!ted in a 2.412 FIM savings @=0.008) in indirect costs per patient and as a result the total costs of asthma (dircct and indirect costs) wcrc 1.762 FIM smaller @=0.09) per paticnt treated during the one ycar study period.",

            "text": "Cost effectiveness in asthma therapy, Germany, It is now widely acknowledged that the pathology of asthma is predominantly an inflammatory process of the bronchial m u m a with smooth muscle contraction secondary to airway inflammation. The conccpt of airway inflammation in asthma and its control by anti-inflammatory therapy has provided more precise aims and the idea of long-term care for both adults and children. In general regular anti-inflammatory treatment reduces in tendency of the bronchi to respond to any endogeneous and exogeneous stimulus. A decreased bronchial hyperresponsiveness may help to diminish asthma exacerbations, nocturnal asthma, diurnal variations in lung fucnction, continuing symptoms and hospital admissions. Thus, an adequate managment of asthma may prevent long-term risk disease by that providing high cost effectiveness. With respect to long-term effects of prologed treatment with steroids questions many raise whether physicians can be sure that this treatment in entirely free of any advers effect, in particularon asthma itself. In literatur, for example, a lack of imfomation is found on which minimal dose of medication is required to contol asthma by that avoiding side effects and reduced cost effectiveness. Our understanding of asthma and its therapy has grown significantly over the two last decades. However, there is evidence that asthma is not well controlled in many patients. Numerous specialists state that hospital admissions and visits to emergency departments may reflect failures of primary preventive carc for asthma of out-paticnts. It is bclicved that specialist care allows greater cost effectiveness and the focusing of clinical cxpertise. However, in medical systems with tiered patient care the cooperation bctween specialists in out-patient clinics and gcncral practitioners is needed. Yet, there are grap of communication between specialists who arc well cxpcrienccd in asthma disease and general practitioners less educatcd in asthma who scc the patient not rarely at times of crisis. So, therc may be a great deal of improvement necessary in the care of asthma by general practitioners. ln the future it must be in primary care that thc really important improvement must take place. It could improve cost effectiveness because it should be more effective in reducing loss of work and hospital admissions and should be probably administratively cheaper. However, the most important task is patient education. Patients must learn what asthma is and what it means to be a chronic discasc. Patients and their families may lcarn that they can manage asthma effectively and, in most cases, live active lives.",

            "text": "The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology (ESPACI) have each published in 1995 a supplement of the present knowledge of adversc reactions to foods and their diagnostics. (1) (2) EAACI has proposed a new classification of adverse food reactions into toxic and nontoxic reactions. Non-toxic reactions include non-immune mediated reactions, i.e. food intolerance, and immune mediated reactions, i.e. food allergy. Allergic reactions can be either I&or non-lgE-mediated. Double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) is widely acccpted as the most reliable method in the diagnosis of adverse reactions to foods. Demonstration of food-specific IgE antibodies either with RAST or skin tests refers to I@-mediated food allergy. In i n h t s unda the age of 1 ycar the tests suggest a relevant food allergy, because at this age it is more difficult to detect specific IgE, and the secondary development of tolerance has hardly taken place yet. (3) In older children the relevance of RAST and Skin test has to be confirmed by DBPLFC. In spite of the large amount of new knowledge on the field, the basic mechanisms of adverse reactions to foods are still poorly understood. The lack of standardized food antigens for the skin tests causes also difficulties. DBPCFC, with which all other tests are compared, is called the gold standard of diagnostics but remains itself unstandardized.(4) Especially delayed rcadions in food allergy are poorly understood. Confusion arises also from the fact that food allergy in infants, children and adults are being described simultaneously, although food allergy in infants is condidercd the main cause of atopic cczema, while in older persons there arc several pathogenctic mechanisms that may lead to the clinical picture. Allergy to basic foods like milk, egg, soy, cereals, fruits and vegetables is often discussed simultaneously, although thc nutritional role of milk and apple, for instance, is strikingly diffferent in infants. Also allergy to milk, egg, etc. has a favourable prognosis during the first 2-3 years of life, whereas allergic reactions to h i t s and vegetables in pollen-allergic p p l c tend to be permanent. R h b e n et a1. (5) have studied the applicability of skin prick test (SPT), basophil histamine release test, patch test and lymphocyte proliferation test in atopic children with either immediate or delayed cutaneous symptoms upon oral challenge to cow's milk. They showed that tests and lymphocyte proliferation tests were more often positive in children exhibiting delayed type reactions, whereas SPT and basophil histaminc release test were more often positive in children with immediate oral challenge reactions to cow's milk. Isolauri and lhjanmaa (6) confirmed this results in 183 patients with atopic eczema. Open and DBPCFC tests of one week's duration cach to cow's milk were pcrformed in all children (age 2-36 months), and both challenge types were positive in 54%. Jmmediate challcngc reactions appcared within 60 min from the beginning of the challenge and delayed-type symptoms within 34 hours on averange. SPT was positive in 48% and patch test in 61% of milk challenge-positive children. In patients with negative oral challcngc to cow's milk, SPT was positive in 16% and patch test in 18%. Sensitivity of SIT alone was 48% only, but with concomitant patch tcst it was a high as 86%. Acutc reactions to oral milk challenge correlated wcll with positivity in SPT, whereas delayed reactions were more often seen in patients with positive patch tests. The patch test panel for food allergy testing in our clinic has included also lyophilized egg, soy, whcat, ryc, barley and oats during thc last two and a half years in the diagnosis of all children under 2-3 years with atopic eczema or gastrointestinal symptoms. In SPT, ordinary flours have been used as test material. Positive SPT to wheat was found in 36% and patch test in 74% of 143 milk challenge-positive children. In 129 milk challenge-negative children, SF' T to wheat was positive in 26% and patch test in 64%. (7) These results suggcst that cereal allcrgy has bcen largcly neglwted. Similar results were published recently by Suomalainen et al. (8) . We have found an extensive panel of skin tests to help select suitable diets for infants to get them symptomless for challenge tests. Hannuksela (9) recommended division of food-allergic peoplc into three different age groups according to the time of appearance of symptoms: 1) infants undet 1 ycar of age, 2) older children and 3) adults. When symptoms appear for the first time during the first year of life, it is probable that the basic foods are responsible When they appear at 1-2 year or later, chocolate, cocoa, citrus fruits, lemonades and candies often end to be responsible. In children and adults with birch pollen allergy, fruits and vegetables often cause symptoms deaibed as oral allergy syndrome. Adults with atopic eczema are seldom suspected to being allergic to basic foods. This should, though, be the case when cczema is chronic and does not disappear cven in summer. Milk, fish and mreal allergy may occur, but the diagnosis is difficul. DBPCFC should be done for one week each under othcnvisc constant conditions, but there are many practical problems with adults, the psychological aspects not being the least. Therefore food allergy in infancy should be properly diagnosed and treated by dictary mcans until tolerance has developed, hoping that later symptoms could be diminished. The delayed-type allergy to foods may also be an IgE-mcdiatcd allergy, even in cases with low total IgE and no detectable specific IgE to foods. Thc reactions may occur via high-affinity IgE receptors expressed on Langerhans and dendritic cells leading to allergcn-specific T cell responces capable of promoting IgE production and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.(lO) If this is the case with atopic dermatitis, the definition of atopic eczema has to be rediscussed, maybe even delayed-type reactions should be classified as IgE-mediated reactions.

Currently, approximately 3% of hospital employees and 5-10% of physicians and nurses working in operation units are allcrgic to NRL. Manufacturcd NRL products, such as surgical and household gloves, catheters, condoms, baby pacifiers and toy balloons may contain allergenic proteins capable of eliciting type I allergic reactions. Recently, substantial progress has been made in the purification and molecular characterisation of several NRL allergens which has facilitated the assessment of their significance and given grounds for proper comparison of thc rcsults obtained by different rcscarchers. in kesh NRL, the source material for manufacturcd products, over 200 different polypeptides have been demonstrated by 2-dimensional immunoblotting but only some 25% thcm bound IgE antibodies from latex-allergic patient sera and can be considered as allergens. NRL-allergic patients frequently have allergic symptoms from a variety of foods, likc fruits and vegetables, but the molecular basis of these cross-allergies is currently poorly understood. Rubber elongation factor (REF) was first suggested to be the major allcrgen (Hev b 1) in NRL and the only allergen present in one latcx surgical glove' but more recent studies show that IgE-antibodies to highly purificd REF, detected by immunoblotting and ELSA, arc practically confincd to the subgroup of patients with spina bifida2.

IgE antibodics to purified prolievein arc found in 70-80% of NRL-allergic patients and prohcvcin elicits positive SPT reactions in most NRL-allergic patients and can thus be considercd as a major NRL allergen. Attempts havc also been made to localise IgE-binding epitopes of prohcvcin. Only a minority (15%) of patients with antiprohevein IgE antibodies had IgE against the prohevein C-domain whereas IgE antibodies to purified hevein, the 43 amino acid Nterminal fragmcnt of provehein, were found in 56% of NRLallergic patient sera'.

            "text": "classified as major allergens. The most important of those is the 20 kD allergen (BDA20) which also appears in the urine, although in low quantities. More than 90% of the immunoblot-positive cattlc tenders have specific IgE against BDA20l. Othcr important allergens of COW dander are the 11 kD and 24 kD protcins. About one third of cow-asthmatic farmers had specific IgE to them. Our recent studies have allowed us to confirm the realtionship bctwcen BDA20 and Prahl's Bos d 2. In fact, the similar amino acid compositions of the two proteins had earlier pointed to this possibility but the final evidencc was obtained from immunochemical studies with anti-Bos d 2 antiserum (made available to us by Dr. Hansen). The spectrum of cow dander allergens is probably more complex than previously presumed. When we used more efficicnt analytical methods it turned out that there are two separate 22 kD allergens in the bovine dander. Moreover, the prcviously described 11 kD allcrgcn scems to be a dimer in its nativc form2. An important goal of thc allergen rescarch is the purification of allergens for diagnostic and therapeutical purposes. Monoclonal antibodies with a high specificity offcr an cfficicnt tool for detecting thc antigen. We utilized this property of our monoclonal antibodies for pyrifying the BDA20 from raw extract with immune affinity chromatography'. When an additional purification stcp was performed BDA20 was almost 100% pure. This preparation has been used successfully in skin tests, histaminc rclcasc assays and in the measurements of cellular and humoral rcsponses4. Anti-BDA20 monoclonal antibodies have also allowed us to devclop a vcry sensitive and rcliable immunometric ELISAS. We have applied it for measuring the concentrations of airborne BDA20 is dust samplcs collected from cowsheds. This method is also vcry suitable for estimating the BDA20 content of cow allergen extracts. Modern methods of molecular biology have madc possiblc a detailed analysis of primary structures of allcrgcns. We creatcd a cDNA library from bovine skin by isolating mRNA and spnthcsizing cDNA which was then cloncd to a bacteriophagc vector. The library was immunoscreened with cow-asthmatic patients' sera containing specific I@. Positive plaques were picked, subclonal, and eventually the cDNA was cloned to a high-levcl expression vector for the production of recombinant allergens. Recombinant DNA technology has allowed us to establish the necleotide and corresponding amino acid sequenccs of t h e cow allcrgcns: a protein related to oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein of the mitochondrial adenosine tiisphosphate synthase complex', BDAll [which shows high homology to human psoriasin, a protcin expressed in psor i a s i~)~ and BDA20*. The analysis of the cDNA indicates that the bovine major allergen BDA20 comprises 172 amino acids, has a predicted molecular weight of 19.56 and pl of 4.48. Sequencc homology searches in the EMBL and SWISS-PROT libraries revealed that BDA20 shows significant similarities with proteins belonging to the functional group named lipocalins, and we think that homology comparisons (amipo acid homology of about 32%) warrant the admission of BD@ to this functionally important family. Ljpocalins are present in the various body fluids and secretions of seyeral 8animal species. They act as carries of small hydrophobic mblkules, such as Ftinoids and pheromones. Interestingly, the major mouse and rat are urinary allergens ( a 2 -e u g l o~u~G j a s c * I j p~l~k 3 T l i i s raises a question of possible commonv'alleri;enic properties of lipocalins and allergens in general. The biological function of BDA20 in the bovine skin is not known. The recombinant BDA20 appeart to be immunologically fully functional. An interesting finding was that the binding of monoclonal antibody or human IgE to BDA20 seems to be almost completcly dependent on the conformation of the molecule. This was observed in experiments in which various segments were deleted either fiom the N-or C-terminal end of BDAIM. After the modification of the molecule, antibody binding was practically lost. As expected, T-cell clones could be induced to proliferate with the fragments. We believe that this finding may have important consequences with regard to immunotherapy. It may become possible to alleviatc allergy with highly dcfined preparations that lack the adverse property of inducing immediate hyperscnsitivity rcactions. Tbc yeats arc some of the most fascinating allergens because of their biologic propcrtics and thc rcsulting multiple form of exposure. We ger exposed to yeasts by foods, such as bread (Soccharomycer cerevisiae), wine (Succharomycesellipsaideus) and beer (Saccharomyces curlsbergensir), We inhale several yeasts as aeroallergens (Cryptococcus spp, Rhodotorula spp.), especially in moist conditions, both indoor and outdoor. Thc most important way of exposure to yeasts is, however, by saprophytic growth on the skin (Pityrosponun ovalelorbiculare) and the mucous membranes (Candido ulbicans).",

Stability of the yeast allergens is extremely poor in storagcd solution. Especially the enolases of Cdbicuns and S.cerevisiue are very labile allergens.

In the coming years thc analysis of the immunomodulating properties of ycast allergens on human immune responses will be the most challcnging era of the yeast allergen rcsearch. Most, if not all, people are sensitized to mosquito bites in the early childhood. Cutaneous symptoms include immediate wheals and delayed bite papules, which tend to be more severe at the onset of the mosquito season. Systemic Arthus-type symptoms may occur but, in contrast to bee and wasp stings anaphylactic mosquito-bite reactions are very rare (1). Mosquito-bite wheal is IgE antibody mediated. With a sensitive immunoblot assay we could show saliva-specific IgE antibodies in almost all subjects with immediate skin reactivity to Aedes mosquitoes (2) . In addition, passive transfer experiments confirmed that saliva-specific IgE antibodies catl cause mosquito-bite whealing in vivo (3). When feeding female mosquitoes inject saliva into the skin. To characterize mosquito saliva antigens we immunized mice with the bites of Aedes communis (northern European species), Aedes aegypti (tropical and subtropical species) and Anopheles sfephensi (Asian species). The main A. communis saliva antigens were 22-, 30-, and 36-kD, A. ueppti saliva antigens 31-, 36-, and 46-kD and A. stephensi saliva antigen 46-kD proteins. Most of the saliva antigens appeared to be speciesspecific and cross-reactivity was observed only between saliva proteins of A. communis and A. punctor, two taxonomically closely related species. Human IgE and IgG4 antibodies from mosquito-sensitive children bound to the same saliva proteins confirming that these are also allergenic in man. At present, the fimction of mosquito saliva allergens is unknown. We could show saliva allergens in the female but not in the male A. communis saliva suggesting that these proteins are involved in blood feeding. We have partially sequenced the 22-kD saliva allergen from A. communis but it showed no homology to any known proteins. A gene expressing the 36-kD protein from A. uegypri salivary glands has also been isolated but the function and allergenic properties of this protein is not known (4). In conclusion, Aedes and Anopheles mosquito saliva contains several proteins which bind human IgE and IgG4 antibodies. In the future, isolation and production of saliva allergens may give tools for immune therapy in mosquito-bite allergy.",

Conclusion: Tall oil rosin contains the same allergenic compounds 8s gum rosin. The differences in the amounts of the allergens are probably responsible for the lower fiequency of allergic reaction\\ to tall oil rosin. The results support the view that skin contact to tall oil rosin may cause contact sensitization. ",

This indicates a mean annual incidence rate of asthma of 0,5/100/y. After family history of asthma (RR 4.0) both current and ex-smoking appeared to be important risk factors for asthma. Regarding smoking habits the hi&est incidence of asthma, 0,9/100/y, was seen in those who were smokers in 1986 but had stopped smoking in 1992. Ifthe risk to develope asthma in never smokers without asthma heredity was 1 in a linear regression model, the risk for ever smokers without asthma heredity was 1,s. in never smokers but with asthma heredity 4,3 and in ever smokers with asthma heredity 6.7; the risk increases mainly additively. In multiple logistic regression models also farming and employed in forestry were risk factors, as well as manual workers in industry and female sex. The profuse airway mucosal microcirculation has scvcral important functions in health and diseasc. One of its major roles lies in the process of extravasation and mucosal exudation of bulk plasma. This response is produced by allergic reactions, infcctious processes, occupational disease factors, inflammatory agcnts, and epithelial shedding. In contrast, simplc neurogenic irritants and metacholine-type challenge arc without exudativc effects. The extravasated plasma harbours adhesive and Ieukocytc-activating proteins (such as fibrinogen and fibronectin), proteases, immunoglobulins, cytokines and cytokine-mudolating proteins, and an endless variety of biologically active pcptides. The plasma exudate-derived dynamic molecular milieu of the inflamcd airway mucosa may cxplain in part why any translation of jxuh~ a l l data to in yiyr function may be fraught with disaster. Ncw data on epithelial restitution, after shedding suggest a pramount rok of plasma exudation in mucosal repair (as well as novel roles for both basal cells and ciliated cells).

To avoid problems caused by such heterogeneity, we are studying asthma in a genetically homogeneous population as a model for multifactorial diseases in general. Even though continuous population existed in Finland for thousands of years, vast regions in the east were settled only within the last 500 years. Migration created isolated, small but expanding breeding units that allowed for genetic drift to affect the frequencies of rare genes. Due to the short population history, original founding haplotypes have not been obscured by numerous successive recombinations, but linkage disequilibrium is commonly seen around rare founding genes in, e.g.. monogenic diseases. Such observations have recently facilitated the positional cloning of genes for an inherited form of epilepsy and congenital chloride diarrhea. As reported in detail by T. Laitinen in this meeting, we used affected relative pair analysis and a family-based association strategy to study the chromosomal region 5q3 1 -q33, previously implicated in the regulation of IgE and bronchial hyperreactivity. No linkage of serum IgE levels to 16 physically ordered genetic markers in 5q31-q33 was detected by the study of altogether 108 sib or cousin pairs, and no significant haplotype associations with high or low IgE levels or the a$thma phenotype were detected in 157 nuclear families originating from a small geographical arca. These results suggest that other genetic factors remain unidentified that affect IgE levels and transmit susceptibility 10 bronchial hyperresponsitivity in this subpopulation. It has long been known that asthma runs in families but the genetic basis of this has, until recently, eluded definition. Debates over whether asthma is inherited as a recessive or dominant trait have long since passed with the recognition of the disease having a polygenic basis which accounts for up to 60% of the asthma phenotype. A single gene such as the polymorphism of the Fc,RI-/3 cham, as proposed by the Oxford group, while seemingly attractive, has proven difficult to reproduce in different family studies. The IL-Q gene cluster comprising IL-4, -13, -5, -9 and GM-CSF encoded on the long arm of chromosome 5 (Se,,,) may be considered in regulating IgE, mast cell, basophil and eosinophil responses. Four independent studies and one by our own group have shown either linkage or allelic association between polymorphic markers located in this region of the human genome and the occurrence of allergy and asthma. Other candidate loci for which some evidence for linkage has been found include the a chain of the T cell receptor (CD3), TNFa and the IL-5 receptor. Using anonymous markers in a random human genome search, at least ten \"hot spots\" have been located. With the recognition that early life events including nutrition, allergen and air pollutant exposure predispose to the later development of asthma and allied disorders provides an opportunity for using genetics to identify those who are at greatest risk of developing atopic disease and in whom early environmental and pharmacological primary prevention might be targeted. The next decade is likely to witness enormous advances in genetic and environmental influences on asthma towards the unified goal of prevention. To achieve this effectively co-operation and collaboration between those interested in genetics and those who believe that environmental factors take primacy in determining disease phenotype.",

There is no age limit for prick testing, In fact, the younger the patient is, the more reliable the results are. In children under one year of age, a positive prick test usually means clinical food allergy. In most older children and adults, a positive test result is valid only for skin sensitivity, not for allergy to ingested foods. Commercial food allergens are reliable in detecting allergy to stable food proteins l i e milk, egg, fish and soy. SPT is the golden standard for testing them. The allergens in fiuits and vegetables are so unstable that they should prefbably be tested as such. The prick-prick method is the method of choice for them. The fiuit or vegetable is pierced first with a prick test lancet and the skin immediately after that. Scratch test can also be used for testing h i t s and vegetables, and also dry allergens, such as flours and powdered spices. In scratch patch test, the scratch is covered with an epicutaneous test chamber or just by a piece of tape for 15 -20 minutes. It is somewhat more sensitive than scratch test but it is needed very seldom. In small children, the back skin is the most practical skin area for prick testing. In older children and adults, the volar aspects of the lower atms are used in most instances. The significance of positive prick tests should always be confirmed by peroral challenge tests. Dcrmatologists use epicutaneous patch testing with chemicals (c.g. nickel) to diagnose allergic contact dermatitis. Recently, several investigators have performed patch testing with protein allergens in atopic dermatitis (AD). It is clinically well known that some patients with AD experience exacerbation of their delayed symptoms after cow's milk challenge. Moreover, several of the patch test positive, cow's milk allergic children were negative in prick tests andor RAST. Although false positive patch test rcsults can occur, a parallcl prick and patch testing with cow's milk had a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.78 in infants with acute-onset and 0.92 in the delayed-onset cow's milk allergic symptoms (4). Ccrcal allcrgic AD children can also show positive patch tests although the type I tests @rick, RAST) are negative ( 5 ) . These results suggest that patch tests can significantly enhancc the diagnostic accuracy of food allergy in children with AD. At present, the value of food allcrgen patch tcsting in adults has not been evaluated in larger studies. Much research is also needed to standardize the allergens and vehicles used in the \"atopy patch testing\", and to elucidate the pathomechanism of patch test reactions to foods and aeroallergens.

A small pilot study of this kind described the chain of care in a limited number of asthmatic children, i.e., mapped the disease in a small sample of patients. The results will be presented at the congress. To study the patient care and cost drivers for asthma, several parameters have to be present or developed, such as information from patients records, record knowledge of the disease, assessment of severity and segmentation of patients, mapping of w e chains (episodes of care), and direct and indirect costs. This type of study also gives information about the more exact and true costs for patients with different seventy of asthma. It allows for studying the quality and effectiveness of care and comparison of treatment costs, indirect costs, and direct costs of different levels of care. Several broadly applicable findings emerged fiom the piIot study.

The conclusion is that a well organized patient education for asthmatics results in both improved health and economic savings for both patients and society.

Forty-three patients (20 men, 23 women, aged 19-55) with mild and moderate atopic bronchial asthma were divided in two groups. The fmt group was treated with a inhalation of magnesium sulphate (a single dose contained 2.5 mmol Mg+2) for two weeks. The second group received placebo (isotonic saline aerosol) for the same time. The single dose of magnesium sulphate aerosol had no greater bronchodilator activity than placebo but, sigmfkantly decreased bronchial hyper-reactivity to acetylchoiie (ACH) and graded physical exercise (GPE).",

However, the aerosol of magnesium sulphate, unlike placebo, reduced bronchial hyper-reactivity to ACH and GPE. We concluded that magnesium sulphate aerosol can reduce nonspecific bronchial hyper-reactivity and mast cell secretion in atopic asthmatics. Two hundred and sixty-seven patients with mild-moderatc asthma (mean age 50 years; mean morning PEF 294 Umin) and not using anti-inflammatory medication participated in a doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group study consisting of a 2-week run-in and a 6-week treatment period. They received Pulmicort Turbuhaler 100 pg, 200 pg, 400 pg or placebo Turbuhaler twice daily. Already after treatment for 1 week morning PEF had increased significantly in all Pulmicorf groups; 23, 22 and 27 LJmin @=0.037, 0.020 and 0.004 compared with the 5 Umin increase in the placebo group). During week 6 the mean increases were 15, 45, 53 and 71 Umin in the placebo group and the 100 pg, 200 pg and 400 pg b.i.d. Pulmicort groups, respectively. All Pulmicort doses were significantly superior to placebo (p4.042, 0.004 and 0.000, respectively). A statistically significant dose response was found; Jonckheere test, p<O. OOO 1). Dose response relationships were also found for e.g. evening PEF, time to response, symptom scores, daily activity scores and sleep scores. Conclusion: A rapid onset of action and a clinically relevant dose response were documented for Pdmicort Turbuhaler. We have previously shown that the increase in PEF (and FEV,) when starting treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid for the first time is negatively correlated with the duration of asthma symptoms (Chesf 1995;108:1228-34). In that study 88 patients started medication with Pulmicort Turbuhaler 400 pg b i d . , corresponding clinically to appr. 1600 &day Pulmicort pMDI. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the change of exhaled NO during treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. The study group consists of nine patients with asthmatic symptoms (cough/wheczing) and significant diurnal variation of PEF and/or reversible bronchial obstruction. NO,,, was measured by chemiluminescence mcthod before and after 6 -8 weeks therapy (hudesonide, fluticasonc). The results were expressed as peak values of NO during a standardized exhalation. 5 .The difference wils not significant. The two patients with lowest basal levels and smallest change during treatment wcrc the oldest subjects of the study (57 and 71 years). These rcsults support the view that NO, , is a promising new lung function test in evaluation of effects of inhalcd corticosteroids especially in younger asthmatics. We have investigated protection against exercise-induced asthma (EM) in children using single doses of salbutamol administered via Turbuhalem versus placebo. Twenty-four children with EIA, mean age 9.6 years (range [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , FEVl 85% (range 62-1 14) of predicted normal, were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study at three centres. Single doses of salbutamol via Turbuhaler (50 and 100 pg) or placebo were given 20 minutes before exercise challenge. Inhalation technique was standardized and each inhalation was supervised. Standardized exercise challenge was performed using a bicycle ergometer. Spirometry was performed before and after the challenge.",

A list of microorganisms indicating a mould problem has been produced at an expert workshop. Their mere presence indicates that there is moist material available. The list can bc used in exposure assessment both in environmental sampling and in screening specific IgG levels of patients. Due to the complex nature of the exposure, observations of dampncss and moisture have been uscd as a proxy of thc indoor mold problem and subscqucnt cxposurc to microbial emission. Wc have used this method for both rcscarch purposc and practical applications, as a first scrccning tool for moisturc and mold problems. In the borcalic climatc of Scandinavia whcrc the heating season is long, up to cigllt months the relative humidity of indoor air low for most of the year and the buildings well insulatcd, moisturc and dampness problems can be avoided with careful building and maintcnancc practices. This is not always the case, and moisture problems occur in thc constructions due to leakages, condensation or insufficient ventilation. Moisture problems of buildings and subscqucnt mold growth have been observed in both private houses and public buildings. Increased awareness of the possible health risks of building-associated mold have raised a lot of public concern in Finland, and it has been necessary to asscss thc magnitude of the problem and its importance to the public health and national economy. As thc first phase, the prevalence and types of moisture problems in private houses wcrc studicd.",

Thcsc houses werc carefully walked through and inspected for signs of water leaks or condensation by a bililding cnginccr, spccifitally trained for this purpose. The signs of moisture recorded were: most spots on walls or other surfaces, visible mold, signs of water leaks, change of color of wooden floors, detached surface materials, e.g., plastic floor coverings, ceramics tiles or paint. A check-list was used to standardize the prcccdurc, and surface moisture recorders were uscd to verify the visual observations of moisture. The tcnants wcrc intcrviewed for the their moisture observations and the history of thc housc using a questionnaire. In 80% of the houses studied, signs of prcsent or prcvoius moisturc problcm could be obscrved. However, in only half of the cases, the tenants were awarc of thosc problcms. Part of the defects werc causcd by flaws in design or construction, and part werc due to natural aging of materials. Some defects had been repaired, but the signs were still visiblc. The inspcctorS also assessed whether there was need for repair or opening the structures for more thorough inspection: 55% of the houses went into this category which means that thcrc are 500 OOO houscs in need for moisture repair. These results show that in most cascs, some kind of a moisture problem will occur during the life-span of the house, and that attcntion should bc paid upon both building practices and maintenancc of thc housc. Certain types of moisture damage were characteristic to certain constructions or period of building practice. In the houses built in the 1950ies, moisture problems in the roofs and in thc basement rooms were common. The roof leakages had only caused minor damages and the open attics had allowed their proper repair. In most of the cases of the bascmcnt damage, the original basement was built for potato and vcgetble storage purposes, and the necessary high relative humidity was obtained from the soil in the uninsulated space. Later, as the need for this type of storage had decreascd, these spaces had been panelled and decorated to serve as TV rooms or other living rooms, but without adding a proper moisture insulation and drainage outside.",

            "text": "Allcrgic rhinitis and comnion cold arc airway diseases charzictcrizcd by mucosal processcs of inflammation. Nasal challenge and lavagc tcchniques havc successfully becn cmploycd to study these processcs. Thc nasal pool-device is onc challenge and lavage technique that compared with others may havc certain advantagcs: Hcnce, the technique allows concomitant challenge and lavagc of a large and defined mucosal surface area for a selected pcriod of time. Furthermore, thc employability of the nasal pool-dcvicc makes it suitablc for challenge and lavagc in children. Important characteristics, including microvascular and cellular indices, of the nasal mucosa in health and disease may be well cxamincd using thc nasal pool-dcvicc and other challenge and lavagc tcchniqucs. The microvascular and epithelial exudation of bulk plasma (mucosa cxudation) is of key interest in airway inflammation. Proinflammatory factors e.g., histamine, lcukotrienes, bradykinins, and select cytokincs including TNFa, produce extravasation of bulk plasma by action on the endothelial cells of post-capillary venulcs. Promptly, thc cxtravasated plasma then movcs up between the epithelial cells and crcatcs transicnt separation of the tight junctions between these cells so that ubiquitous paracellular pathways for the clcarancc of plasma into thc airway lumen arc rcdily created. The luminal entry of plasma, although involving movcmcnt of largc protcins such as a,-macroglobulin, is non-injurious as it lcavcs thc skuctiirc nT tlic cpitliclium intact. Furthermorc, the integrity of the mucosa as an absorption bamcr is uncompromiscd. Indeed, in sustained airway inflammation mucosal exudation may even be associated with a rcduccd absorption permeability. Thc physiological, non-injurious mcchanisrns involved in extravasation and luminal entry of bulk plasma in animal and human airways are the basis for thc proposal that mucosal exudation should be considcrcd a major first line defence mechanism of the airway mucosa. Mucosal exudation of bulk plasma is induccd by challenges that activate discasc-likc inflammtion, e.g. allergens, isocyanates, and common cold viruses. Accordingly, incresed concentrations of plasma proteins in airway mucosal surface liquids have been demonstrated in allergic rhinitis and common cold, as well as in nasal polyposis, asthma, and chronic bronchitis. The bulk plasma exudate has a widespread and intriguing distribution in these disease: The lamina propria, the basement membrane, the airway epithelium and the mucosal suface are thus furnished by potent plasma-derived peptides and proteins. Thereforc, the mucosal macromolecular milieu in airway inflammation would be dramatically different from that of the normal mucosa. In addition to its function as a mucosal defence mechanism, the plasma exudate may be a pathogenetic factor in these airway disease: Physical properties of the plasma exudate may e.g., interfere with the normal hydration of the airway and impair mucociliary transport. Furthermore, the plasma pcptide and protein systems may sustain airway inflammation. Morcover, in allergic rhinitis and common cold, an exudativc hypcrresponsiveness may develop: Histamine thus produccs grcatcr plasma cxudation responses in on-going allergic and infectious rhinitis than in control situations. This increased proclivity of thc airway subepithelial microcirculation to rcpond with plasma exudation may be a kcy fcaturc of inflammatory airway discasc. The exudative hyperresponsiveness may not be explained by an incrcased absorption pcrmability of the airway mucosa, as this may be rcduccd in allergic rhinitis and unaffected in common cold. The microcirculation is but one of the mucosal end-organs that may dcvclop a hyperresponsivseness in airway inflammation. The lumina entry plasma may reflect the intensity and time coursc of airway inflammatory proccsscs. Accordingly, thc cfficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment in rhinitis and asthma may be exprcsscd as dccreascd amounts of plasma proteins on the mucosal surface. In human airways, in contrast to animal airways, this cffcct appears to be mediated almost exclusively by effects on the inflammatory process rather than by pharmacological actions dircctly on thc microcirculation. In summary, mucosal exudation of plasma is a key further of airway inflammation in rhinitis and asthma. The proccss indicates the inflammatory nature of thesc diseases and it providcs an opportunity for quantitative meansurement of the inflammatory involvcment. Mucosal exudation is primarily a dcfcncc mechanism, but in rhinitis and asthma the plasma exudate with its potcnt peptidcs and proteins has a multipotential role in the perpetuation of airway inflammation. The bulk naturc and the widespread mucosal distribution (lamina propria, epithelium, and airway surface) of the plasma exudatc indicatcs that plasma with all its potent protein systems may dramatically dctcrmine the biologically active molecular milieu of the mucosa. For example, plasma-dcrived products (e g fibrinogen and fibroncctin) may decide cellular function and traffic, %-macroglobulin distributes and targets several cytokines, and an endlcss number of plasma-derivcd peptides are produced (clotting, complcment, and kinin systems). The plasma exudation proces~ may thus influence cellular activities and the distribution and flux of cellular products within the mucosa and onto the airway surface. In agrcement, wc have demonstrated that the mucosal output of L-6 in seasonal allergic rhinitis is dramatically increascd by a simple challenge with an exudative concentration of histamine, suggesting that the mucosal exudation process alone can incrcasc the concentration of this cytokine in airway mucosal surface liquids. Increased concentrations of cellular products in mucasal surface liquids may thus be due to increased cellular production and rclease, increased transport to the mucosa surface by the plasma exudation process, or a combination of thcsc processcs. Trcatmcnts that rcduce the cellular inflammatory processes ( e g gluwrticoids) rcducc thc conccntrations of plasma proteins in airway mucosal suface liquids. We have further demonstrated that budesonide rcduus thc numbcr of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa togcthcr with the mucosal output of albumin and fibrinogen in scasonal allcrgic rhiiiitis, and that loratadine reduces markcdly allcrgcn challcngcinduced mucosal output of %-macroglobulin and modcratcl y tryptase in exerimcntal acutc allcrgic rhinitis. Howcvcr, thc anti-exudative effects of antihistamines, in contrast to that of glococorticoids, may not be well maintained in nasal allergic disease conditions. In summary, the nasal mucosa is a suitable part of the airways whcrc wcll-controllcd challenge and lavage techniques can be used for studics of airway inflammation. Cellular products and indices of plasma exudation can be analysed in the lavagc fluids to detcrminc cellular activation and tissue involvment, respcctivcly, in diffcrcnt diseascs. The plasma exudation process may also influence cellular activitics and thc flux of cellular products into airway surface liquids. These possibilities emphasise the importance of in vivo obscrvations in studics of airway inflammation. Tidal flow-volume 0 curves have recently gaincd much interest as no cooperation other than quiet breathing is required, and may be mcasurcd in awakc infants and young children. The ratio between time to peak cxpiratory flow and tot31 expiratory time (rPEF/tE) is thc usual parameter. TlV loops may also be obtained by inductance plethysmography (RespitraceO) without face mask. TFV curves measured by a pncumotachograph and by inducancc plcthysmography, showed similar rcsults with similar intraindividual variation. TFV curves exhibit typical pattcms in infants with obstructive airways disease with effect in inhaled bronchodilators. A predictive cffcct of TFV curves upon later wheezy illness in fants was reported. Referencevalues from 803 newborn infants were published from Oslo, and recently a correlation (~0.70) between the change to inhaled salbutamol in tPEFItE and eosinophil cationic protein in early infant wheczers was reportcd. Resistance and compliance of the total respiratory system (Rrs and Crs) may measured by obtaining a passive expiratory flow-volume curve after relaxation of the respiratory muscles by passivc occlusion of the respiratory tract at end-inspiration (cliciting the Hering-Brcuer reflex). By extrapolating the flow-volumc curve to volume at zero flow, Crs eas calculated by dividing this volume by occlusion pressure. Rrs could then be calculated by dividing the time constant by the Crs. The passive singlc occlusion technique has been used to measure Rrs and CIS in awake newborn infants. Rccently, recference values from measurements in 664 awake newborn infants were presented from Oslo. Crs may also be measured by the multiple occlusion technique by determining the slope of a pressure-volume line produced by thc multiple occlusion. Resistaiice of the respiratory system may be measurcd by the forced oscillation technique, by superimposing pressure loudspeakcr oscillations to thc airways. The resulting airflow oscillations allow measurement of the impedancc (prcssurcflow relationship) of the rcspiratory system. The method has been used in pre-school children. Howevcr, furthcr evaluation is rcquircd bcforc this mcthod can be used in a clinical setting. Methods suitcd for mcasurcmcnts in awake infants and childrcn arc urgcntly nccdcd to monitor the airways inflammatory proccsscs. TFV curves rcprcscnt a promising method ir. For many years improvement in 1) symptoms and 2) lung functions have been the most extensively studied outcome parameter for asthma drugs. Howcvcr, during rcccnt ycars it has bccn realized that other ourcome parameters including reduction in 3) frequency and severity of acute exacerbations, reduction in 4) mortality, 5) cost-effectiveness contrrJi of 6) airway hyperresponsiveness, normalization of the 7) chronic inflammatory changes in the airways, 8) prevention of airway remodelling and irreversible airway obstruction and 9) normal growth (children) or decline (adults) in lung function, may be of similar or even greater importance than improvement in peak expiratory flow rate and symptoms. Furthermore, the question of whether early intervcntion with inhaled corticosteroids can 10) change the natural course or cvcn 11) cure the asthma disease or thc 12) risk of systemic effects are important parameters to consider when the rcponsc to inhaled corticosteroids in studied. lnhalcd corticostcroids have been shown to have a marked and significant effect upon paramctcrs 1-9 and pcrhaps also an ctfcct upon outcomc parameter 10 without any clinically important systemic side cffccts. All other asthma drugs mainly have a reproducible effect upon parameters 1 and 2.",

These improvements in lung function and symptoms precede and reach a pleteau before the reduction in reponsiveness. The additional improvcment in symptoms with increasing doses is rather small, and oflen in takes an additional four-fold increase in dose to produce an additional significant effect on symptoms or peak flow measurements. Low doses of inhaled steroids also have a significant effect on airway hyper responsiveness or lower airways functions. However, the dose response curve of these parameters in less steep so that it is possible to demonstrate a significant log linear dose response relationship over a much wider dose range on these parameteri in childrcn with moderate and severe asthma.

As a consequence many children are undertreated, optimal asthma control is not achieved and inhalcd corticostcroids are either not prescribed or prescribed after the asthmatic condition has developed for many years. Recent findings suggest that if treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is not initiated until the asthmatic condition has developed for several years it is more difficult to achieve continuous, optimal long term control than if this treatment is introduccd early after the debut of asthma symptoms.

Today 3.700 contact allergens have been described and new ones are identified every year. Usually. a formulated product has caused contact eczema in an exposed individual and when he or she is patch tested with the product as well as its ingredients the new allergen is identified. It is crucial to use analytically defied chemicals, to avoid testing in a patient with current eczema, to use serial dilution tests to defiie a threshold of sensitivity and to prove by testing non-exposed subjects that the test preparation is non irritant. Corricosteroidssystemic or topicalare an essential medication for allergic diseases. Interestingly, they are themselves also capable of causing allergic reactions. Systemic corticosteroids may cause a variety of allergic symptoms from flare to anaphylaxis-like reactions. The latter have been ccnsidered to be usually caused by pseudoallergic mechanisms and they are also rare. The most common allergy to corticosteroids is contact allergy and it has not been shown to be associated with 'anaphylac toid reactions. In several studies corticosteroids have been shown to be common contact allergens. Corricosteroid that has caused most patch test reactions is tixocortol pivalate. Tixocortol pivalate reactions reveal contact allergy to hydrocortisone, the most commonly used corticosteroid. by allergic cross-reactivity. Tixocortol pivalate itself is not used as dermatologic preparation and sensitization through contact to it is therefore not likely. Other corticosteroids that often cause patch reactions are budesonide and hydrocortisone butyrate. Contact allergies to Compositue plants may cause a severe and frequently chronic dermatitis. Typically it starts in the summer with acute eczema either on light and air exposed areas or on areas of plant con-it disappears spontaneously during the fall. Repeated exposure over a number of years may cause severe intractable dermatitis afFccting the patient throughout the year. The major allergens responsible are sesquiterpene lactones. Since 1990 we included the scsquiterpene lactone mix (SLmix) in the standard series. Patients suspected of having Compositae dermatitis were finther tested with the Compositae extract mix ",

Allergen-specific T-cell responses in atopic patients are dominated by the T helper (Th) 2 subset, which produces, among other cytokines, high levels of I L 4 , IL-5 and IG13, and low levels of IFN-y. IL-4 and IL-13 induce IgE synthesis by human B cells whereas, IFN-y, which is predominantly produced by Thl cells and CD8+ T cells has inhibitory effects. IL-4, but not IL-13, also induces naive CD4+ T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells. Furthermore, IL-3 and IG5 produced by activated allergen-specific Th2 cells account for growth, differentiation and survival of eosinophils, which are implicated in lung damage associated with asthma.",

The clinical implications of these findings will be discussed. Subpopulations of effector CD4+ helper T cells that produce distinct sets of cytokines are important in various infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases. Thl cells secrete L-2 and IFN-y, and Th2 cells produce IL4, IL-5 and IL-lo. These polarized subsets of differentiated helper T cells arise from a common a naive CD4+ T cell precursor that produces small amounts of IL-2 and no detectable IFN-y or IL-4. In order to gain insights into the molecular basis of subset-specific cytokine gene expression, we have analyzed cytokine gene transcription and transcription factor activation in Thl and Th2 murine helper T cell clones and in bulk populations of TCR-transgenic T cells as they undergo subset differentiation in virro. Our findings suggest that differences in NFKB and Stat6 (lL-4Stat) activation are related tL differences in T cell subset phenotype and differentiation.",

TCR stimulation of Thl clones induces a consistent incnase in nuclear p65(RelA) which binds to an IL-2 promoter NF-KB site probe in gel shifi assays. The nuclear p65(RelA):p50 ratio, as determined by gel shift assay. is significantly greater than 1.0 in activated Thl clones. In contrast, TCR signaling does not induce a significant increase in nuclear 65(RelA) in Th2 cells, and the p65(RelA):p50 ratio is consistentfy less than 1 .O. Western blot analyses indicate that there are equivalent amounts of cytoplasmic p65(RelA) in Thl and Th2 cells, but TCR signaling is not efficiently coupled to nuclear translocation of p65 in Th2 cells.

Expression of IFN-y mRNA in IL12 plus antigen stimulated naive T cells occurs early, within 6 hours. In contrast, expression of IL-4 mRNA in IL-4 plus antigen stimulated naive T cells does not occur until 48 hours. IL-2 mRNA is equivalently expressed in both L-4 and IL-12 treated populations during the primary stimulation. No consistent differences are found in NFAT. AP1, NFKB, or NFIL-2A activation between Thl and Th2 differentiating populations. We have identified a sequence in the murine IL-4 promoter which shares features of Stat6 (IL-4NAF) binding sites previously described in other promoters. Gel shift assays using a probe with this sequence indicate that it does bind purified Stat6 but not Stat4 or Stat5, and it also binds Stat6 found in the nuclei of IL-4 stimulated T cells. We have also demonstrated that this site can mediate IL4 induced transcription of a linked reporter gene. Gel shift and Western blot studies indicate that Stat6 is induced early in the IL4 mated naive T cells, and activation (i.e. nuclear presence) is maintained for over 48 hours. We have also demonstrated autocrine Stat6 activation in these Th2differentiating populations. Stat6 can be activated in Th 1 populations by IL-4 treatment, consistent with our fmding that L-4 promotes a switch from Thl to Th2 phenotypes. Thus prolonged Stat6 activation is the only transcription-regulation event which we have idenWied which distinguishes Thl and Th2 differentiation of naive T cells. Studies are underway to further define the functional effects of Stat6 binding to the IL-4 promoter and the possible interaction of Stat6 with other transcription factors.",

It allows a closc contact betwecn lymphocytes and their cognatc antigens and other cell types necdcd to create effective immune reponse. In lymphoid organs, lymphocytes leave the blood by adhcring to specialized vesscls called high endothelial venules (HEV) because of the morphological appearance. of their endothelial cells. Binding of migrating lymphocytes to endothelial cells is mediated by scquential intcraction between lymphocytc surface molccules and thcir endotheial cell counter-rcccptors. There are at least four steps in this cascade: 1) recognition dctccted as rolling of thc lymphocyte on the endothelial cell, 2) activation, 3) tight adhesion, and 4) transmigration. In physiological conditions two functionally distinct systems mediate lymphocyte traffic to peri;.;leral lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphatic tissucs. in inflammatory situations lymphocytes together with other leukocytes migrate to sites of inflammation. Inflamed skin and synovium arc tissues to which lymphocyte homing has been studied most. The recent rcsults show that the mechanisms controlling lymphocyte entrance to inflamed skin and synovium are different from each other and also distinct from those mediating the extravasation to peripheral lymph nodes or mucttsa-associatcd lymphoid tissucs. An important molecular pair mediating lymphocytc traffic to inflamed skin is cutaneous lymphocyte antigen-1 (CJA-1) that binds to its endothelial cell ligand E-sclcctin, Moreover, periphcral lymph node addrcssin (PNAd) is induced and vascular adhesion protcin-1 PAP-1) is upregulated in inflamcd skin endothelium, and they both sccm to be important in mediating lymphocyte intcraction with vascular endothelium in inflamed skin. In animal models, lymphocyte homing into inflamcd skin has been shown to involve also lymphocytc function associatcd antigcn-1 (LFA-l), very late activation antigcn-4 (VLA-4) and CD44. Participation of thesc molccules belonging to different molecular families in lymphocytc homing into inflamed skin suggest that at least three distinct, but most likely overlapping, adhesion mcchanisms (CLA-1 -E-selcctin; L-selectin -PNAd; unknown lymphocytc rcccptor -VAP-1) arc involvcd in rclatively early phases of the multistep cascade resulting in lymphocytc extravasation into the cutancous sites. Moreover, integrins &FA-1, VLA-1) may be functioning during thc f i r m adhcsion phase. The exact location of CD44 in the cascade is most speculative.

Nasal peak expiratory flow is also sometimes used as well as nasal cytology, mucous membrane biopsies, or tryptase and other mediator measurements. Conclusions: 1) most of the diagnosed cases of OR are immediate type allergic rhinitis, 2) the status change is most important in the registration of the response to the PT, but also an objective measurement should be included in the response recording, 3) nasal symptoms and status changes caused by various industrial exposures are underestimated. 060 readings increases the reliance on individual readings which might be affected by exercise,late waking etc.,reduces the measured diurnal variation, and reduces the diagnostic sensitivity of the record. Workers with severe occupational asthma may however, show obvious work-related changes even with very small numbers of readings per day. Differences between work days and rest days are accentuated by plotting the lung function as a dakly maximum, mean and minimum which can be assessed either visually or by using a computer-aided scoring system. We have developed such a system (0ASYS)which plots the record in an interpretable manner and provides a score based on either a discriminant or neural net analysis, achieving a sensitivity of about 85% and a specificity of around 95%. The quality of the records is the single most important determinant of a good test.

The problem is in distinguishing these changes due to exposure from those due to diurnal variation and the major confounding factors of infection, treatment and the dayto-day non-specific precipitants of asthma.

The rccuded IgE-binding capacity might imply a reduced risk of inducing side effccts without influencing the sequcntial based T-cell recognition of activating sites in the allcrgcn.

Furthermore, the exlusive use of drug treatment may have a fundamental impact on the diagnosis of allergen scnsitization in thc future. Basically, allergy diagnosis is a must for prescribing spccific treatment. The dcmand to know the allergens to which a patient is sensitive is not essential for drug treatment (effectivc for both allergy and non-allergic symptoms). Thc drawback of not knowing the allergy state might reduce to possibilitics of avoiding allergens responsiblc for inducing symptoms and cxacerbations. The advantages of combining allergen avoidance, immunotherapy and drug treatment require furthcr investigations of individual and combinations of treatment focusing on patient compliance, long-term prcventivc aspects, and cost/effectivencss/side-effects. As long as the long-term prcventive capacity and safety of topical steroids is almost completely unknown, a strategy relying almost exclusivcly on inhalcd corticosteroids might turn out to be. erroneous.

I tw pollen and grass allergens have been shown to consist of many isoallergenic forms that display single or multiple amino acid substitutions. To gain more insight into the relevance of the occurrence of isoallergens for allergic sensitization, we investigated the T cell epitope-specificity and the interspecies crossreactivity patterns of T cells reactive with Bet v 1, the major allergen of white birch (Bctula vemcosu). To this aim, we generated Bet v I-specific T cell lines and clones from the peripheral blood of three allergic patients. The clones were generally CD4+, and displayed a Tho-like cytokine production. IJsing overlapping synthetic peptides, we were able to identify multiple r cell epitopes in Bet v 1. However, 7/21 native Bet v 1 -reactive T cell clones did not react w i t h recombinant Bet v 1 or with synthetic peptides, indicating that they may react with other other Bet v 1 isoallergens. Therefore we decided to study the crossreactivity patterns of the clones with group 1 pollen allergens of other members of the Fagales order. The results showed the presence of several distinct crossreactivity patterns. These results strongly suggest that multiple isoforms of Bet v 1 arc involved in the sensitization to birch pollen, giving risc to distinct iwform specificities and crossreactivity patterns. ",

Thus there secms to be a period in early life during which an infant is particularly susceptible to sensitisation. Variations in individual susceptibility to sensitisation over time may also partly be explained by the presence and absence of repiratory tract infection. The role of infections in the respiratory tract as risk factors for the development of childhood allergic disease and asthma is complex, however. It is wcll established that infections may trigger and aggravate asthma in already sensitised individuals and that infections incrcase bronchial hyperreactivity. Recent studies suggest, however, that respiratory infcctions could modify primary immune rcsponses to allergens and reduce the likelihood of sensi t isa t ion. The environment has undcrgonc major changcs. The discussion on the possible impact of the various enivironmental changes on the incedence of asthma and other allcrgies has mostly bcen limitcd to the possible effects of a deteriorating air quality, poorly ventilated houses and a increased exposure to certain allergens, notably house dust mites. \"Endovironment\" is much more than emissions from traffic and exposure to mites, however. Urbanisation has lcad to major changes in habits, thc food that wc eat arc in many respects diffcrcnt than only a few decades ago, the intestinal microbial flora has undergone changcs, ncw building materials and methods for construction have bccn introduccd, the homes arc larger dwellings, there are many new chemical compounds at home and the life style has changed with more time spent indoors and extensive travelling and cxposurc to ncw environments.

Air pollution is a major problem in many formerly socialistic countries in central and eastern Europe, yet the prevalence of atopy among childrcn is much lower than in western Europe. For example, the prevalence of positive skin prick tests is much lower in Eastcm Germany, Estonia and Poland than it is in Western Germany and Sweden. Mirroring the observed diffcrcnces in skin prick tcst positivity in an urban and rural area of Sweden, the prevalence of at least one positive skin prick test was significantly higher in Tallinn, an industrialised coastal city than in Tartu, which is an inland university town. Thus although air pollution docs scem to play a role in the devclopmcnt of atopy, other factors conncctcd with wcstem lifc stylc arc much more important. Thc naturc of thesc factors is unknown. Thc hypothesis that early childhood is a period of particular susccptibility to environmental influences and the onset of the \"atopic march\" is supportcd by studies showing that the large differcnccs between Eastern and Western Germany in the prevalence of scnsitisation to inhalant allergens are limited to the age groups born after 1961.

A good inhaler thus should deliver a large dose to the lungs, with a concomitant low oropharyngeal deposition Different inhalers show large variations in the degree of lung deposition and each combination of drug and device is a unique combination. Caution should be exercised when extrapolating the outcome of one combination from other combinations of drug and device. Lung deposition for dry powder inhalers (DPIs) ranges from 10 to 30 %, with Turbuhaler' at the upper end of the range and most other DPIs at around 10 YO. pMDIs also vary in lung deposition; some pMDIs give 15-20% while others deliver 10-15% ofthe nominal dose to the lungs. A high lung, and a low orophmyngeal, deposition optimises the balance between desired effects in the lung and undesired local or systemic side e m s . This balance can be. described by the YTratio, where L denotes the local, desired availability of the given drug and T denotes the total systemic availability The LJT-ratio gives an index for comparison of different formulations of the active drug.

QttantiUttive variation in IgEi is considered to be of importance in the dctcmhation of risk of astma, while othm *or risk factors may still be unknown.. Before engaging in the study of the genetic architectwe of asthma, ie. to determine which gems am involved, their polymorplsms . andtheavengetffec$sareouhtcd with these ddcs, it is useful to astimato the ~~n t d h t i o i~ of genetic and environmental factom in the &ology of asdrmk Tha heritability of d t is a major detmnhant of the samypfe Size ntctssary to detect individual disease loci. Also, the proper identification of the base population is a ncccwuy pmrequisitc for dmwing valid infermces. The Finnish Twin Cohort (FTC) has been established in two stages, in 1974 and in 1987, to include M0, OOO twin pairs. A population-based twin cohort pumits independent asCatainment of twinship and disease status and allows comparison of incidence rates in twins of different typ#p. This, in tum, enables mom accwatc estimates of the mle of genetic influen= on liability to disease. Large numbers am required to permit identification of eufficicnt and qmentative numbers of exposure-discordant MZ pairs: Studies on the mortality of astma-discordant pairs indicate that the increased mortality associated with asthma appears to be independent of genetic factors. Thirdly, a large cohort permits assessment of age, gender and social environmental effects with statistical robustness; Data from the FTC show that heritability of liability to astma decreases w i t h age being high in adolarccnts (see below) and less in middle-aged adults ( N i MM, Knprio J, K~v u o M. A popllation-bued study of bronchial asthma in adult twin pairs. chest 1991;10&70=15.). Finally, information on the biological relatives of twins can be obtained, so that familiessf-twins become the sampling units and the resolution of geaetic and cultural transmission can be improved. For example, Finnish twins, their siblings and parents from five consecutive birth cohorts (1975-1979) form the FinnTwinl6 study sample. The twins are ascertained from the national population registry, which identifies nearly 100% of all living twins. Baseline questionnaires are mailed to the twins within 60 days of their 16th birthday; pairwise response rates -85% across gender and zygosity, and 3 years of data-collection targeted 1858 families. P m t s w m sent their own questionnaires and also asked about health and development of the twins during childhood. A history of asthma and hayfever were asked of the twins and of their parents. Univariate analysis of the twin data hdkatcd that over 60% of the variance in the liability to asthma could be attributed to genetic factors. Parental asthma increased the risk of asthma in the twins, but parental hayfever alone did not increase the risk of asthma in their children.

Chair Hospital Therapy at Amur State Medical Academy, Blagoveshchensk, Russia. Clinicoimmunologic examination of 30 patients aged between 20 -50 with moderate to severe bronchial asthma (BA) was undertaken. All the patients received T. by 2 inhalations 4 times a day for 18 days. Before treatment in patients with BA a decrease of relative and absolute CD3+, CD4+ and CDt+limphocites, phagocytosis suppressions, heterogenous alterations of serum immunoglobulines and high circulating immune complexes (QC) levels were reported. The content of CDulimphocytes did not changed truly. AAer T. treatment CDg+limphocytes increase dueto suppressible link, CD4+/CD*+ ratio normalization decline of CIC content and phagocytic activation with expressed clinical improvement of patienti condition were observed. BAL investigation has shown both neutrophile and limphocyte increase and alveolar macrophage decrease. Thus, antiasthmatic membrane stabilised effect of T. is associated with it's corrective influense on immune status. 040 PROTECTIVE EFFKT OF INTAL / SODIUM CROMOGLY-CATE / ON PAF -INDUCED REACTION IN PATIENTS Efficiency of lntal for suppression of PAFinduced reactions were investigated in atopic asthma. The influence of daily lntal inhalations during 4 weeks on platelet aggrqation, the amount of cAMP in them before and after therapy, changes in platelet functions after 15 minutes incubation with lntal in vitro were investigated. In patients with high level of platelet aggregation activity the improvement of clinical symptoms and correction of platelet hyperactivity were observed simultaneously during the course of Intal therapy. Maximum amplitude of ADP-aggregation I Born determined / in patients with atopy was 6 8 3 5 3,6% before treatment / in healthy persons -47,3+4,5?/, /. After lntal treatment the maximum amplitude of ADP-aggregation in asthmatics did not differ from healthy people / 46,2 3,8% /. Basic levels of cAMP in atopir asthmatics platelets were 13,l I+ 1,71 before and 13,412 1,94 after treatment respectively and did not differ from normal. The research is based on the conception that Intal has ability to interfere directly in regulation of functional activity of platelets.

Allergic reactions can be subdivided into two main varieties; the delayed hypersensitivity reaction like contact allergy to nickel and the immediate ,IgE-mediated form as in atopic asthma and hay fever. T lymphocytes are important effector cells in both forms. The first contact between an antigerdallergen and the antigenpresenting cells (APCs) is crucial in dictating the outcome of the immune response. Inhibition of the LFA-l/ICAM-1mediated interactions between APCs and T cells during sensitization to an allergen will induce long-term allergenspecific unresponsiveness(Scheynius et al. J Immunol 156: 1804, 1996). The route for introducing an allergen is also important since APCs from different tissues have the capacity to favor either cellular or humoral immune responses by influencing T cell cytokine production (Everson et al. J Lekoc Biol59:494, 1996). CD4+ T lymphocytes can be classified into functionally distinct subsets on the basis of their cytokine production (Mosmann et al. Annu Rev Immunol 7:145, 1989). Thl cells secrete interleukin (1L)-2 and interferon (1FN)-y and are essential in the host defence against intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-5 and are important in antibodymediated immune reactions and in the defence against parasites. IL-4 stimulates B cells to IgE production, while IL-5 stimulates eosinophils. When CD4+ T cells produce both types of cytokines, they are denoted Tho cells. Thl cells dominate in contact allergy whereas Th2 cells are more prominent in IgEmediated allergic reactions. However, the analysis on biopsy specimens and of allergen-reactive T cell clones isolated From peripheral blood or target organs have indicated that there is not only a mixture of different Th-type cells but also that Thl cells are able to produce some IL-4 (Haanen et al. J Exp Med 174583,1991) and Th2 cells can secrete low levels of IL-2 and IFN-y (Yssel et al. J Immunol 148:738, 1992).",

Kanerva Section of Dermatology, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland.Aims: To review the current understanding of occupational contact urticaria (OCU), and give stiltistical data on OCU. Methods: The diagnosis of OCU should includc an appropriate history, combined with specific skin tests, IgB determinations (e.g., RASTs), provocation tests, RAST inhibition tests. immunoblotings etc.Results: Altogether 815 cases of OCU were reported to thc Finnish Register of Occupational Diseases during 1990-1Y94, compared with 1944 caSes of occupational allergic contact dermatitis. Accordingly, the total number of occupational allergic contact dermatoses was 2759,29.5 % being contact urticaria and 70.5 8 being allergic contact dermatitis. Occupational contact urticaria was much more common in women (70 %) than in men (30 8). The six most common causes of contact urticaria were (1) cow dander (44.4 %), (2) natural rubber latex (23.7 %), (3) flour, grains and feed(1 1.3 a),(4)   handling of foodstuffs(3.1 a),(5)  industrial enzymes(1.7 %)    and (6) decorative plant$(1.6 8). The occupations with the highest numbers of occupational contact urticaria were ( I ) farmers, (2) domestic animal attendants, (3) bakers, (4) nurses, (5) chefs and (6) dental assistants. The ranking list of the most common occupations with occupational contact urticaria per 100 000 employed workers was as follows: ( I ) bakers (1 40.5 cues per 100,000 employed persons), (2) preparers of processed food, (3) dental assistants, (4) veterinary surgeons, ( 5 ) domestic animal attendants, (6) farmers and silviculturalists.
