For example, hepatitis A has been transmitted to patients from contaminated plasma derived both in the United States and in Europe. Until the early 1990s this virus was not thought to be blood-borne and thus was not part of the viral donor screening required. Examples of new emerging viruses include a new hepatitis virus, hepatitis G, which has recently been discovered and which is potentially transmissible by blood and plasma (16). This virus, like hepatitis C, is a flavivirus and thus should be susceptible to inactivation procedures shown to be effective against Hep C. Another new potential blood-borne virus, human herpesvirus 8 (HHV 8) , has also recently been identified (17) . This virus has been implicated in HIV-infected patients who develop Kaposi's sarcoma and is also thought to be sexually transmitted. Whenever animal-derived material is used in production, then a risk of viral contamination must be considered. For this reason, not only products that are produced from animal-derived material such as murine hybridomas, recombinant cell lines, or blood products require testing, but also products that have used animal-derived material in their production are at risk. Many cell culture systems have been adapted to grow in serum-free conditions to minimize the risk of bovine virus contamination, but the tissue culture supplements used in their place, such as transferrin, can pose as much of a risk as serum as they are usually derived from bovine or human blood. Similarly, products that are purified by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography can also theoretically become contaminated with viruses that were present in the initial hydridoma or recombinant cell line used to produce the affinity resin.

Viral testing is not normally performed on the final product. As mentioned previously, direct testing is not sufficient to ensure that the final product is free from viral contamination. Direct methods are often designed to pick up known specific contaminants and thus the testing methodologies may fail to pick up the presence of other unknown or unsuspected contaminants. Second, the methods developed may be so specific that they fail to pick up variants of known potential contaminants (for example, as was seen in the initial hepatitis C screening kits). The third limitation on direct testing methods concerns the ability to detect low concentrations of viral contamination. All testing methods have a limit of detection, which can be ascertained by validation of the assay. Below this level virus may be present but can escape detection.

In order for the experiments performed at laboratory scale to be extrapolated to the manufacturing scale, the scale down of the process must be validated to ensure that it is a true representation of what occurs in the manufacturing process. Ease of scale down differs depending on the step to be studied and can be an important factor is the choice of which steps are to be validated. Solution inactivation experiments such as pH treatment and heat treatment are relatively easy to scale down, ensuring only that buffer composition, pH, protein concentration, and temperature are consistent with manufacturing conditions. Spiking experiments are normally run to mimic worst case conditions in manufacturing so as not to overestimate the viral clearance capacity of the step. The ICH viral safety document states that the level of purification of the scaled-down version should represent as closely as possible the production procedure. For chromatographic equipment, column bed-height, linear flow rate, flow rate to bed-volume ratio (i.e., contact time), buffer and gel types, pH, temperature, and concentration of protein, salt, and product should all be shown to be representative of commercial-scale manufacturing. Column scale down is normally performed by maintaining bed height while reducing column diameter, which maintains the residence time. In this way the linear flow rate (cm/ h -1 ) is maintained while the volumetric flow rate (mL/h -1 ) is reduced. A more-detailed review of chromatography scale down is available (28).

Product yield and activity are essential parameters of any method. Under certain circumstances there may be certain limitations in accurately scaling down some of the parameters of the step. Under these conditions, the deviation should be noted and its impact on the validity of the results achieved addressed. Problems can also arise in ensuring the validity of the scale down, as the virus spike can often have a dramatic impact on the starting material and on the purification of the product. Many virus preparations used in spiking experiments undergo minimal or no purification and are often crude harvests from cell culture supernatants, which may also contain the contents of lysed cells. These preparations contain high concentrations of protein (including serum), lipids, nucleic acid, and, in some cases, phenol red as a pH indicator in the culture medium, all of which can severely affect the purification of the product. It is highly desirable to use virus preparations that have either been grown in serum-free medium or have been produced in such a way as to contain very little or even no protein to reduce the impact on the purification procedure. Wherever possible, the impact of virus spiking on the process should be examined by performing mock spiking experiments in advance of the actual studies using the buffers or medium in which the viruses are stored.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Scale-Down of Production Steps"}, {"text": "Although it is possible to produce stable virus preparations for nonlipid enveloped viruses in completely protein-free buffers, enveloped viruses need a certain protein concentration in the environment to maintain stability.

For example, for the High S Macroprep column, spiking at a 1:20 ratio (final concentration of BSA 0.025%) yielded very poor product recovery. Only when spiking at a 1:100 ratio was the specification criteria met for a valid purification. A similar result was seen for the Phenyl Sepharose column. Crude virus preparations would obviously have even more dramatic effects on product recovery and validity of the scale-down process. Although the guidelines recommend that a virus spike should not exceed 10% v/v, it is clear that it is difficult to achieve anywhere close to this spiking level given these problems.

It is not uncommon for a chromatography column to be used for over 100 cycles of purification. Obviously column regeneration, cleaning, and sanitization are extremely important under these conditions to ensure both consistency of purification performance and also to ensure that any viral contaminant bound onto the resin would be inactivated between purification cycles. These concerns are not purely theoretical. Figure 3 shows the results from experimental studies performed by Pharmacia that demonstrate that virus can bind onto chromatography matrixes and survive several cycles of purification before eluting out with the product (28, 29) . In this process, IgG was fractionated using a three-column process. The final chromatography step on CM Sepharose was performed by dividing the eluate from the previous Q Sepharose column into three batches, which were run consecutively on the same CM Sepharose column. This column therefore performed three cycles of purification before regeneration and sanitization. To study the effect of potential virus carryover, virus was spiked only into the load material for the first purification cycle. The load material for the second and third cycles was not spiked. The IgG fractions from the first and third purification cycles were then assayed for the presence of infectious virus. No infectious virus was detected in the product fraction from the first purification cycle despite the high virus load in the starting material indicating complete clearance of the virus. However, significant amounts of infectious virus were recovered in the IgG fraction from the third purification cycle. Because the only introduction of virus into the system was in the load material at the first purification cycle, virus must have bound onto the chromatography resin during the first cycle to elute during later cycles of purification. These results raise several issues of concern. First, a validation study design, which looked only at the first purification cycle, would have assigned a high clearance factor based on the fact that all virus was removed. However, this value would have been a severe overestimate of the clearance capacity of the process as virus is recovered during the process. Second, the importance of validating the sanitization regime against potential virus contaminants is clear in order to eliminate any possibility of virus build up on chromatography resins during manufacturing, which could cross contaminate different batches of product. Third, it may be prudent to perform spiking experiments on both new resins and on resins at the end of their production life (aged resins) in order to ensure that clearance values do not vary from batch to batch.

For example, for products derived from murine cell lines at the Phase I clinical trial or IND submission stage, it is usually sufficient to only examine the clearance of murine retrovirus. However, a comprehensive panel of at least four viruses would be necessary for product licensure. The virus selection is based on viruses that have been identified as contaminants or potential contaminants of the starting material (so-called relevant viruses) and also on representing the spectrum of different physicochemical characteristics of viruses (model viruses). The use of model viruses is an important concept in these types of studies and is used to address various issues. First, it would be impossible to perform spiking experiments with every possible contaminant of the starting material. For example, viruses that can potentially be transmissible by human-plasmaderived products are shown in Table 8 . This list is continually expanding as scientific knowledge increases. In practice each potential virus contaminant is not used to spike the process, but rather one virus acts as a model for a group of viruses with similar characteristics. Second, some of the viruses that are known to be potential contaminants of the starting material cannot be grown at all in tissue culture or grow poorly and thus spe-cific model viruses have to be used (for example, the use of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) as a close taxonomical model for Hepatitis C). Third, the use of model viruses covering the range of different virus characteristics acts as a safeguard to ensure safety of the final product from adventitious virus contamination. If a process study has demonstrated good clearance of viruses representing different virus groups and characteristics, then there is a high degree of assurance that any adventitious virus, if introduced into the system, would be cleared by the production process. The same arguments also apply to the risk posed by unknown viruses. As new viruses continue to be identified, there is potentially a risk that starting materials may contain as yet unknown viral contaminants that could escape detection by existing tests. However, the physicochemical characteristics of any new virus should be represented in a comprehensive validation study. In practice we have seen this situation with the recent identification of Hepatitis G virus. This virus is similar to Hepatitis C and thus data from studies that were performed in the past using BVDV as a model for Hepatitis C can now also be extrapolated to Hepatitis G without the need for further spiking studies. As stated in the 1996 CPMP guidelines, the division of viruses into relevant and model is in a sense artificial, because all the viruses used in these studies are tissue-culture-adapted strains that may differ from the field isolates. However, the terminology helps to outline the justification for the virus selection used in a study and will be used to describe the following examples of virus selection.

Reovirus 3 is often used in studies, because the virus is zoonotic and infects a wide variety of cell lines from different species.

I have selected in this example mouse minute virus (MMV), a parvovirus that has been found as a contaminant in production runs of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-line-derived products.

Therefore, upon submission of these products to the regulatory authorities for re-registration or approval of process changes, more attention to virus safety and viral validation is being requested. Also, with the increased use of transgenic animals to produce biopharmaceuticals, the issues of viral contamination of these products are very relevant.

Each assay type has specific advantages and disadvantages. The two main in vitro assay methods used to quantitate infectious virus in virus clearance studies are the plaque (or focus) formation assay and the cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. Both assay types have been successfully validated and are used reliably for the quantitative determination of virus titer and process reduction factors. Plaque assays offer the specific advantage of producing a countable event, i.e., plaque formation, vs virus dose (Fig. 4) . The virus titer per milliliter is determined by dividing the total number of plaques by the total volume of original sample tested. This method of computation is an averaging procedure, which gives equal weight to equal volumes of the original suspension at different dilutions. In order to determine the standard error (SE) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for a sample, the standard deviation is calculated at each dilution. From the standard deviation, the variance is then calculated (the square of the standard deviation) and the standard error in the plaque counts is then calculated from the square root of the sum of the variances multiplied by the number of replicates per dilution. Dividing this figure by the overall volume tested gives the standard error of the titer. Since these values are normally expressed in logarithmic terms, the standard error is transformed into log 10 by dividing the standard error by the titer and multiplying by the constant, 0.434 (the log of e). To determine the 95% confidence interval, the number of replicates is totaled (n) to calculate the degrees of freedom (n-1) and this value is used to look up the critical t-value for a 95% confidence interval from t-statistic tables. The standard error is then multiplied by the critical t-value to give the 95% confidence limits for the plaque titer.

The accuracy of this assay is dependent on how accurately the infection rate at each dilution is determined. For this reason, a larger number of replicates at each serial dilution leads to more accurate titer determinations. Ensuring that several serial dilutions infect between 10% and 90% of the inoculated cell cultures also increases accuracy. Care must also be taken in the method used for calculation of the titers. Although the Spearman-Karber method is widely used (33), the methodology has an absolute requirement that serial dilution's giving 100% and 0% infectivity are demonstrated. These criteria are often not met in virus titrations (for example, when only low levels of virus are present) and under these conditions an alternative method of calculation such as the probit method or modified Karber methods should be used to ensure accurate determination of viral titers.

The ethanol fractionation process used in the purification of plasma-derived products has demonstrated a classic example of why this point is so important. Spiking studies were performed on repeated ethanol fractionation steps and the log clearance values obtained for each step were added together to give very large clearance factors for the process, sometimes in excess of 20 logs.

The two best-characterized systems used in these studies are the mouse-and hamsteradapted strains of scrapie. These rodent-adapted strains of scrapie can be used as models for BSE and CJD in spiking studies and numerous studies have been submitted to regulatory authorities worldwide using these models. The highest titer material available for spiking studies is obtained from brain homogenates prepared from infected animals (titers for 10% w/v brain homogenates vary from 10 7 infectious units/mL for the ME7 mouse-adapted strain to 10 9 infectious units/mL for the 263K hamster-adapted strain), which can be partially purified to varying degrees. However, the use of brain homogenate spiking can have a dramatic affect on the purification of a product and care must be taken to ensure that a valid purification is still possible after adding this amount of homogenate into starting material. After sample collection, samples are assayed by intracranial injection of serial dilutions of the samples into the mice or hamsters (normally anywhere from 6 to 10 animals per serial dilution are injected). Animals are observed for periods up to 400 d postinjection for clinical signs of infection. Both rodent systems follow predictable dose-response curves with mice injected with high titers of the ME7 strain showing clinical signs from approx d 160 onward, while the hamster 263K strain starts to show clinical signs in Syrian golden hamsters from approx d 70 onward. The hamster-adapted strain is now becoming the model of choice due to the higher titers and quicker assay times, although this system does have other disadvantages.
