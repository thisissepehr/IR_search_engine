The specific affinity reaction of nucleic acids (hybridization) and antibodies towards antigens is the most common bioanalytical method for generating multiplexed quantitative results. Nucleic acid-based analysis is restricted to the detection of cells and viruses. Antibodies are more universal biomolecular receptors that selectively bind small molecules such as pesticides, small toxins, and pharmaceuticals and to biopolymers (e.g. toxins, allergens) and complex biological structures like bacterial cells and viruses. By producing an appropriate antibody, the corresponding antigenic analyte can be detected on a multiplexed immunoanalytical microarray. Food and water analysis along with clinical diagnostics constitute potential application fields for multiplexed analysis. Diverse fluorescence, chemiluminescence, electrochemical, and label-free microarray readout systems have been developed in the last decade. Some of them are constructed as flow-through microarrays by combination with a fluidic system. Microarrays have the potential to become widely accepted as a system for analytical applications, provided that robust and validated results on fully automated platforms are successfully generated.

The desorption of capture molecules has to be prevented. Currently, gold surfaces and plastic microarrays are described less often in the literature, even though covalent coating is as easy as silane chemistry. Self assembled monolayers are formed reproducibly on gold layers with sulfur-containing compounds [64] and can easily be implemented in analytical microarrays [65] . Plastic substrates are activated by photochemistry producing radicals on the surface [66, 67] . With all these strategies a monolayer for covalent attachment is created. This first step serves for activation of the substrate. Glass substrates are generally activated with silanes. They carry terminal head groups like amines, epoxides, thiols or aldehydes which are used for immobilization of proteins [68] . This strategy works also for other molecules containing a terminal amino group such as amine-modified oligonucleotides and haptens. For covalent attachment of proteins, DNA or other molecules, aminosilane-coated glass slides have to be derivatised with a homobifunctional crosslinker. Mercaptosilane-coated glass slides use a heterobifunctional crosslinker. Aldehyde and epoxide-coated slides react directly with terminal amine groups. The silanization process does not produce a high-density monolayer [69, 70] . The free binding sites for non-specific adsorption have to be blocked intensively with proteins such as BSA.

The newer techniques consist of high-parallel microdispensing devices, such as the TopSpot technology, which acts by using piezo-triggered, short, pneumatic pressure pulses [90, 91] . These non-contact printing systems are used for high-throughput microarray production because of the advantage offered by the very fast printing process. The printing solution is transferred to a reservoir of the pump head and can be delivered to a considerable number of slides as carrier substrate. By using multiple microdispensing units on the printing system the process is made parallel and, therefore, more cost-efficient. The limitation of these non-contact printing devices is the high technical effort required for installing a robot system and the accuracy of microdispensing. The spotting buffer often contains salts and detergents that prevent adsorption on the walls of the microtitre plates used for storage of the printing solution. The disadvantage of added supplementary compounds is that the printing head can become irreversibly clogged. In contrast, the printing process of contact printers is very reproducible and the contact pins have a long lifetime.

In contrast, the other format uses immobilized cell lysates and labelled proteins for screening the functional activity of a protein. There are also microarrays adapted from immunoassay formats in microwell plates. Depending on the readout system they are called fluorescence or chemiluminescence microarray immunoassays (F-MIA or CL-MIA). All these kinds of microarray have one reaction area and a integrated fluidic system is absent. Samples and assay reagents are placed on top of the microarray and are passively incubated. After this incubation step the slides are cleaned and dried. For read out, the microarrays are placed in an appropriate detection system (fluorescence or chemiluminescence microarray reader). Many manual process steps (washing, drying, transfer to reader) are required. The microarrays are used only once. For calibration, positive and negative controls are often included to ensure that threshold limits for positive responses are maintained and that non-specific adsorption does not create a false negative result. This type of analytical microarray is used for screening applications by obtaining semi-quantitative results. If quantitative results are required, each slide is analysed for one multi-analyte concentration. Passive incubation steps dramatically increase the assay time. These platforms are very helpful for protein screening applications in proteome analysis. However, they will not gain acceptance in the field of on-site analysis of food, water, or diagnostics.

Fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and electrochemistry currently dominate as 2D readout systems for analytical platforms. Fluorescence and chemiluminescence microarray platforms, especially, are used for detection of pesticides and pharmaceuticals in an indirect competitive immunoassay format. Protein target toxins, clinical biomarkers, or microorganisms are analysed with a sandwich immunoassay format. The detection methods are optimized for selectivity, sensitivity, and low limits of detection. The assay performance depends now more on the availability of antibodies with high affinity constants and low crossreactivity. Total assay times are in the range of minutes, which is only possible in fully automated systems under non-equilibrium conditions. Only a few flow-through microarray platforms exist at the moment, consisting of an automated fluidic system for rapid and reproducible multiplexed applications. Automated analytical microarray platforms will compete with applications that completely solve a relevant multi-analyte problem, e.g. the quantification of [127] possible contaminants such as antibiotics in milk, toxins in food, or microorganisms in drinking water. Further example include detection of doping drugs during a sport event, prevention of a bioterrorist attack, or the accurate and early diagnosis of a tumour marker. Automated flow-through microarrays as monitoring systems will become more and more relevant in the future. Regulations for monitoring drinking water and food are enforced in many places. Surface and ground water has to be protected from chemicals in order to guarantee a good water quality [195] . Safe drinking water does not contain contaminants that are harmful to health. The US EPA published a list of regulated contaminants including 53 organic compounds and seven microorganisms, and a list of potential contaminants including bacteria, viruses, pesticides, and toxins [196] .
