A recent review showed that codetection of Gram-negative bacteria and endotoxemia is strongly predictive of increased risk of mortality compared to detection of neither [1] .

A large RCT, the ABDO-MIX trial in France, has failed to show survival benefit and improvement in organ failure with Toraymyxin treatment compared to conventional treatment of peritonitis-induced septic shock [15] . Recruitment into another large RCT, the EUPHRATES trial in the USA, is now closed and the results showed that polymyxin B hemoperfusion plus conventional medical therapy did not reduce mortality at 28 days in patients with septic shock and high endotoxin activity ( Fig. 19 .1, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01046669).

Polymyxin B has been shown to bind to the lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella typhimurium at the negatively charged 2-keto-3deoxyoctulosonate lipid A region of the lipopolysaccharide molecule. This is achieved via electrostatic, and possibly hydrophobic, interactions at a stoichiometric ratio of one polymyxin B molecule to one lipopolysaccharide monomer unit [22] . Furthermore, Vesentini et al. demonstrated that short-range interactions between polymyxin B and endotoxin are mediated mainly via hydrophobic forces, whereas long-term complex formation is mediated via ionic forces. The interaction energy occurring in each molecular complex was calculated at different intermolecular distances, and the binding forces were estimated by fitting interaction energy data. Maximum binding forces calculated via molecular mechanics for the polymyxin B-endotoxin complex range from 1.39 to 3.79 nN [23] .",

The endotoxin adsorption capacity of polymyxin B-immobilized fibers has been shown to be almost the same as that of the ion-exchange resin IRA-938 ( Fig. 19 .3a, b) [24] . The endotoxin detoxification capacity of polymyxin B-immobilized fibers in vitro changes depending on the number of residual primary amino groups in the immobilized polymyxin B molecule [24] . In an in vivo canine experiment, the survival rate of endotoxin-challenged dogs was higher when the immobilized polymyxin B had a large number of residual primary amino groups ( Fig. 19 .4b) [24] . These results suggested that polymyxin B-immobilized fibers had a maximal endotoxin detoxification capacity when three primary amino groups were left unbound from the carrier fiber. Furthermore, concentrations of immobilized polymyxin B above 3.5 \u03bcg/mg of fiber were suggested to be optimal. Because the primary amino groups are positively charged, it is likely that they play a major role in the ionic binding of polymyxin B to endotoxin [24] . In addition to detoxifying the limulus activity of endotoxin, polymyxin B-immobilized fibers have also been shown to neutralize the pyrogenic activity of endotoxin solution in a rabbit pyrogen test. Therefore, polymyxin B-immobilized fibers are also effective in removing pyrogenic agents from serum ( Fig. 19 .5) [24] .",

            "text": "The Toraymyxin column was originally designed to specifically adsorb endotoxin. Plasma endo-toxin levels significantly decrease immediately after PMX treatment compared with pre-treatment levels [10] . By using data from a multicenter study, Tani reported that PMX treatment significantly reduced plasma endotoxin concentrations from 83.7 \u00b1 26.7 pg/mL to 56.4 \u00b1 27.9 pg/mL after 2 h of direct hemoperfusion with a Toraymyxin column [29] . Although almost all of the studies conducted so far have demonstrated a significant decrease in plasma endotoxin levels following PMX treatment, a recent RCT failed to show such an effect [12] . However, this could be due to the use of the LAL assay, which is prone to contamination and lacks precision and accuracy resulting in both false positive and false negative results [30] . Indeed, our previous study showed that sensitivity for the detection of endotoxin in the turbidimetric LAL assay was very low ( tic shock who required PMX treatment [31] . A new method for the detection and quantitation of endotoxin is therefore immediately needed. Recently, Romaschin developed a rapid assay, called the endotoxin activity assay (EAA), that detects endotoxin in whole blood by using autologous neutrophil-dependent chemiluminescence [32] . The EEA has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a clinical method for the diagnosis of endotoxemia, and was used in the EUPHRATES trial (see Sect. 19 .5.1) [33] .",

Endotoxin binds to and activates factor C, a clotting enzyme, early in the LAL cascade, which ultimately results in the production of the insoluble protein coagulin. Coagulin spontaneously forms a polymer, and it is this polymer formation that is detected in the turbidimetric LAL assay. Obata LAL cascade after endotoxin stimulation depends on the concentration of endotoxin before gelation [34] . The ESP method allows for more rapid and sensitive detection of endotoxin compared with the turbidimetric LAL method. Furthermore, ESP is able to discriminate between patients with sepsis and those with septic shock undergoing gastrointestinal emergency surgery compared with the standard turbidimetric LAL assay [35] . After undergoing PMX therapy for a longer-duration (> 2 h), the hemodynamic condition of patients with septic shock due to intra-abdominal infection improved, and the reduction in plasma endotoxin concentration could be detected via ESP but not through the standard turbidimetric method. We have demonstrated the ability of endotoxin adsorption in longer-duration PMX treatment [36] . Using the ESP method, we observed a reduction in endotoxin after passing through the Toraymyxin column even when PMX duration was greater than 2 h. Therefore, ESP appears to be sensitive enough to detect circulating endotoxin in the plasma of patients with septic shock who require PMX therapy.",

Jaber reported that it may be possible to use Toraymyxin to remove lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from peripheral blood [47] . In an in vitro study, polymyxin B significantly suppressed LTA-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that LTA may also be removed during direct hemoperfusion with PMX and that this removal may be due to binding of LTA to polymyxin B. Other recent studies have reported a possible relationship between immune cells and the reduction in inflammatory mediators. Ono demonstrated that the expression levels of HLA-DR, a major histocompatibility complex class II cell surface receptor on monocytes, and CD16 on granulocytes, markedly decrease in patients with septic shock. However, PMX treatment had beneficial effects by increasing leukocyte expression of these surface antigens [37] . The number of CD16 + CD14 + monocytes and the expression level of monocytic toll-like receptor 4 dramatically increase in patients with severe infection, and recent studies have shown that PMX treatment is effective in reducing both of these in patients with septic shock [38] . Moreover, Ono demonstrated that the removal of surplus circulating CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells in patients with septic shock via hemoperfusion with Toraymyxin might represent a novel strategy for inducing recovery from sepsis-associated immunosuppression [39] . Tsuzuki have demonstrated immediate inhibition of NF-\u03baB binding activity and suppression of TNF-\u03b1 secretion after endotoxin neutralization with polymyxin B regardless of whether the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were already producing TNF-\u03b1 or not [40] . Reducing the number of circulating monocytes or modulating their function may contribute to improving pro-inflammatory responses following PMX treatment.",

PMX treatment was well tolerated and no significant adverse effects were observed. Patients treated with PMX showed significant increases in cardiac index (P = 0.012 and 0.032 at days 1 and 2, respectively), left ventricular stroke work index (P = 0.015 at day 2), and oxygen delivery index (P = 0.007 at day 2) compared with controls. Furthermore, the need for continuous renal replacement therapy after study entry was significantly reduced in the PMX group (P = 0.043). There were no statistically significant differences in endotoxin and interleukin six levels, and organ dysfunction as assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, or 28-day mortality. Note that sepsis in the patients enrolled in this study was likely too severe to find statistical significance in the mortality outcome. Together, these results show that PMX treatment is safe and that it improves cardiac and renal dysfunction due to sepsis or septic shock.",

A 33-80% reduction in plasma endotoxin levels compared to pre-treatment levels was also observed. The large decrease in mortality was associated with an improvement in hemodynamic condition: after PMX therapy, mean arterial pressure significantly increased by 19 mmHg (mean increase, 26%; range, 14-42%), and dopamine/ dobutamine dose was decreased by 1.8 \u03bcg/kg/ min.

Sixty-four patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who had undergone emergency surgery for intra-abdominal infection were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized within 6 h after open abdominal surgery to either conventional therapy (n = 30) or conventional therapy plus two sessions of 2 h PMX with an interval of 24 h between sessions (n = 34). Twenty-eight-day mortality was significantly improved in the PMX group (32%; 11/ 34 patients) compared with that in the conventional therapy group (53%; 16/30 patients). In the PMX group, mean arterial pressure significantly increased from 76 mmHg (before treatment) to 84 mmHg (72 h after treatment; P = 0.001) and vasopressor requirement (measured as inotropic score) significantly decreased from 29.9 (before treatment) to 6.8 (72 h after treatment; P < 0.001). In contrast, in the conventional therapy group, mean arterial pressure (before, 74 mmHg; 72 h after, 77 mmHg; P = 0.37) and inotropic score (before, 28.6; after, 22.4; P = 0.37) did not change significantly with treatment.

This multicenter randomized controlled study demonstrated a nonsignificant increase in mortality and no improvement in organ failure with PMX treatment compared to conventional treatment of peritonitis-induced septic shock.

The 28-day mortality rate recorded in both groups was significantly lower than that reported in larger studies (between 32.7% and 53% for similar patient cohorts) [51] [52] [53] .
