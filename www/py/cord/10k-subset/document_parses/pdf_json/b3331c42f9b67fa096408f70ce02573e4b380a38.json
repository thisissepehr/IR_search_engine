The distribution of MFE is central to many questions in evolutionary theory and is a key parameter in models of molecular evolution. Here we define the mutational fitness effects in influenza A virus by generating 128 viruses, each with a single nucleotide mutation. In contrast to mutational scanning approaches, this strategy allowed us to unambiguously assign fitness values to individual mutations. The presence of each desired mutation and the absence of additional mutations were verified by next generation sequencing of each stock. A mutation was considered lethal only after we failed to rescue virus in three independent transfections. We measured the fitness of each viable mutant relative to the wild type by quantitative RT-PCR following direct competition on A549 cells. We found that 31.6% of the mutations in the genome-wide dataset were lethal and that the lethal fraction did not differ appreciably between the HA-and NA-encoding segments and the rest of the genome. Of the viable mutants, the fitness mean and standard deviation were 0.80 and 0.22 in the genome-wide dataset and best modeled as a beta distribution. The fitness impact of mutation was marginally lower in the segments coding for HA and NA (0.88 \u00b1 0.16) than in the other 6 segments (0.78 \u00b1 0.24), and their respective beta distributions had slightly different shape parameters. The results for influenza A virus are remarkably similar to our own analysis of CirSeq-derived fitness values from poliovirus and previously published data from other small, single stranded DNA and RNA viruses.

Accurate assessment of this lethal fraction is an essential, and non-trivial, task. In a reverse genetic approach, the efficiency of transfection and viral recovery are key parameters, since a failed transfection and a lethal mutation will both give supernatants with undetectable titers. We used two approaches to address this problem. In the first, we estimated the transfection failure rate and calculated the probability of miscalling a viable mutant as lethal. Over the course of this study, we transfected the WT virus 19 individual times, and never failed to recover virus in our P0 supernatants. As in [13] , we quantified the expected probability of a transfection failure as if we had observed a single WT transfection failure. This conservative approach gave a per transfection failure rate of < 5.26%.

In a set of 128 viruses, we would expect to falsely identify fewer than one (128 \u00c3 1.46 x 10 \u22124 = 0.019) virus as lethal.

We therefore considered a mutation to be lethal if we had undetectable virus in three independent transfections or if we were unable to recover the mutation in a P1 stock after blind passage of the P0 stock.

If a compensatory mutation swept through the population, it would confound assignment of a fitness value to the initial mutation. Therefore, we sequenced the entire genome of the P1 stocks for 78 of our mutants on the Illumina platform to identify any second site mutations and their frequency. In all but 3 cases, the desired mutation was present at >94%, and was present at >99% in nearly all. Very few additional mutations were identified at >2% (Table 2,  S2 Table) .

Given the relative imprecision of one step growth curves for quantification of growth parameters in influenza and many other viruses, we measured the relative fitness of each mutant in direct competition with the WT over serial passage [18] . In this assay, the mutant is competed with a tagged WT reference, which has a cluster of synonymous mutations in the PB1 open reading frame. These mutations allowed us to distinguish the barcoded WT from a non-barcoded mutant in a mixed infection using quantitative reverse transcription PCR with primers specific for their respective sequences. Importantly, this tagged WT virus competed equally well with the untagged WT virus over 6 passages, demonstrating the selective neutrality of the marker ( Fig 1A) . In our serial passage competition assay, the change in relative frequency of the WT and mutant over time is the difference in growth rate, or the selection rate constant ( Fig 1B) . The exponent of this value is the relative fitness. We have shown previously that this assay can provide precise measurements of relative fitness with as few as 3 technical replicates [18] , although it is less sensitive for weakly deleterious or beneficial mutations with a relative fitness close to 1. We performed our competition assays in A549, a cancerous human lung epithelial cell line, which supported efficient replication of WSN33 and may be more physiologically relevant to influenza virus replication than other commonly used lines. Passages were carried out at a multiplicity of 0.01 infectious units (TCID 50 ) per cell. Given that the burst size of influenza A in A549 cells is <100 per cell, most passages will represent 2 cellular infection cycles with minimal co-infection in the second cycle.

While the HA/NA and internal Influenza Mutational Fitness Effects datasets had a similar lethal fraction (Table 1 and associated text), the fitness impact in the viable fraction tended to be lower in the HA/NA-encoding segments relative to the internal segment group, but did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.08, Mann Whitney U test).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 254, "text": "Fig 3A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 307, "end": 314, "text": "Fig 3B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 353, "end": 360, "text": "Fig 3C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 420, "end": 427, "text": "Fig 3D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1204, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Influenza Mutational Fitness Effects"}, {"text": "The fitness values of the viable mutants were not distributed normally, and we therefore determined which type of distribution best fit the data.

For each dataset, the beta model was the best at capturing the distribution of fitness effects. We also fit distributions from a large, recently published dataset of poliovirus mutants [48] . Here, the beta model also provided the best fit. These beta models are described by two shape parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, in which the expected value of the beta distribution is \u03b1/(\u03b1+\u03b2). The \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters for each of the random, surface, and internal influenza MFE datasets as well as the poliovirus MFE dataset are similar (Table 4 ). Some have suggested that deleterious mutational fitness effects may be better explained by more complex models [49] . We therefore attempted to combine the above distributions with uniform distributions, in which we allowed the latter to describe a proportion of our mutants' fitness effects. However, in the cases tested, adding this uniform distribution did not improve the fit of our models. While the influenza A and poliovirus mutational fitness effects were both best described by a beta distribution, there was no similar consensus among previously characterized viruses [19] . VSV was best described by a lognormal + uniform distribution, TEV by a beta distribution, phiX174 by an exponential distribution, QB by a gamma distribution, and F1 by a log normal distribution.

Recent work suggests that epistasis is quite prevalent across the influenza virus genome, and we therefore considered it likely that the same mutations would have distinct fitness effects in other genetic backgrounds [50] [51] [52] [53] . To understand the degree to which our fitness measurements for specific WSN33 mutations are generalizable, we compared our data to those obtained for analogous mutants in WSN33 and other genetic backgrounds. Bloom and colleagues have used deep mutational scanning (DMS) to broadly sample most of the possible amino acid substitutions in the HA and nucleoprotein open reading frames [35, 46, 54, 55] . Deep sequencing of mutant libraries before and after passage was used to infer site preferences for every amino acid at every site and to calculate site entropy, or inherent tolerance of substitution at a given site. Site entropy will tend to capture the general mutability of a position, while site preference is likely to be more specific for a mutation in a given genetic background. Importantly for our comparison, many of the plasmids had multiple mutations and the site preferences represent the average effect of a mutation in the background of very similar, but distinct, sequences. We first compared our 43 HA point mutants to DMS data on HA from WSN33 [35, 46] . Here, we observed a statistically significant, and reasonably strong, correlation between our fitness values and site entropy for nonsynonymous substitutions (Fig 5A, Spearman r = 0.56, p = 0.0018). Consistent with the fact that both datasets were generated in the WSN33 background, the correlation between the fitness of viruses with our substitutions (nonsynonymous and synonymous) and the site preference for the same substitution was similar (Spearman r = 0.66, p < 0.001). It isn't clear the degree to which the modest correlations for site entropy and site preference are attributable to differences in experimental set-up or the scale and error of measurement for two very different datasets. Of note, Thyagarajan and Bloom observed a similarly modest correlation (Pearson r = 0.48, p < 10 \u221210 ) between their DMS data on WSN33 and a DMS separate study by Wu et al.

In PR8, a closely related lab strain, we found a stronger correlation between fitness and site entropy (Fig 5B, Spearman r = 0.79, p = 0.0037).

Together, our fitness values are reasonably correlated with site entropy in distinct strains and subtypes, and these data suggest that a sizeable portion of mutational fitness effects are attributable to the general mutational tolerance at a given site. The observation that fitness was correlated with site preference for HA in WSN33 and NP in PR8 (H1N1), but not in Aichi (H3N2) suggests that the fitness impact of these mutations will vary with genetic background due to intragenic or intergenic epistasis. We are cautious in this interpretation given the differences in the underlying experimental design, sample size, and nature of the datasets, as outlined above.

Indeed, we found only two mutations, both in HA, that were present at reasonably high frequencies in more recent, circulating strains (S4 Table, S2 Fig). One was weakly deleterious, Q381L (fitness 0.93 \u00b1 0.06, present in 78.7%) and the other was beneficial, HA M420I (fitness 1.12 \u00b1 0.07, present at 79.7%).

This set of viruses includes viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes (among which the authors found similar distribution patterns), and influenza is the first segmented virus to be described by this method. We compared the lethal fraction, mean, and variance of our mutational fitness effects to these previously characterized viruses. Because relative fitness values in VSV, QB, phiX174, and F1 were measured as differences in exponential growth rate, we first transformed our serial passage fitness values based on the wild type exponential growth rate in our experimental conditions (S5 Table) . A similar transformation has been described for TEV to allow comparison of exponential growth rates across systems (see Methods and [19] ). Overall, we found that the lethal fraction and our scaled fitness values closely matched those for these other small DNA and RNA viruses. We also calculated the skewness and kurtosis for each data set to quantitatively describe the shape of the distribution (Table 5) . Following the general property that mutations are more likely to be deleterious than beneficial, we found negative values for skewness in each of our data sets. Kurtosis, measuring the \"peakness\" of a distribution, was above 5 for each of our data sets. A positive kurtosis value indicates that a probability density function has a heavier tail and more values near the mean than predicted by a Gaussian distribution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1113, "end": 1117, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1355, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1523, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1844, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1848, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1849, "end": 1852, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1856, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1857, "end": 1860, "text": "56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2592, "end": 2596, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 478, "end": 484, "text": "Table,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 485, "end": 493, "text": "S2 Fig).", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1205, "text": "Table.", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}, {"start": 2451, "end": 2457, "text": "Table)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2867, "text": "(Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Fitness in alternate genetic backgrounds"}, {"text": "We report the first genome-wide study of the mutational fitness effects of single nucleotide mutations in influenza A virus.

Both the lethal fraction and the overall distribution of MFE of influenza A are quite similar to what has been found for ssDNA and other RNA viruses. Consistent with what has been assumed, but to our knowledge never shown, the surface proteins of influenza virus appear to be slightly more tolerant of point mutation than the internal viral proteins.

Similarly, mutagen sensitivity has been used to define the global impact of mutation and the relative robustness of viral strains or even multiple viral species [23, 30, 31, 57, 58] . Neither gives a reliable estimate of the lethal fraction and comparisons across viral families can be confounded by differences in host cells, basal viral mutation rates, and the pleiotropic effects of commonly used mutagens on cellular metabolism. More recently, several groups have used higher throughput assays to measure viral mutational tolerance [33, 35, 48] . While these approaches allow for impressively large datasets, they are similarly imprecise in assigning fitness values to individual mutations. Because lethal and strongly deleterious mutations will be present at extremely low frequency, they are easily lost from populations with serial passage and variably ascertained by even the best deep sequencing approaches. For example, the impressive characterization of poliovirus MFE by CirSeq could only quantify the average fitness of a mutation across a range of haplotypes, given that each mutation can potentially arise in the setting of a genome that already bears a different mutation [48] . Many mutations were also present at very low frequency, varied significantly across passages, and were presumably subject to clonal interference. Measurement of fitness effects from these data also required extensive modeling of genetic drift. In influenza A virus, two different groups have used random mutagenesis of plasmids and next generation sequencing of recovered viruses to infer the mutational robustness of hemagglutinin [33, 35] and nucleoprotein [54, 55] .

Host-specific evolutionary rates are also higher for HA and NA relative to the other 6 segments [62] . The 6 internal segments have similar rates, and we were underpowered to distinguish differences in robustness among them. Our finding of a trend toward increased mutational tolerance in the HA protein, and the head in particular, is consistent with the tolerance of HA to transposon insertion [59] and deep mutational scanning experiments [35] . These data suggest that HA is more robust to mutation, possibly as a consequence of this history of strong and repeated selection for antigenic escape. A byproduct of this robustness could be the greater exploration of antigenic sequence space and subsequent immune escape [63] .

Their similarity likely reflects shared constraints due to small and compact genomes [19] . Small genome viruses often have overlapping reading frames or regulatory elements that are more sensitive to genetic disruption. Larger genomes allow for more genetic redundancy and modularity, which could limit the impact of point mutations. Interestingly, the hypersensitivity of these viruses to mutation at an individual level may actually promote robustness at a population level [69] . In large populations under strong purifying selection, deleterious variants are rapidly purged and the wild type sequence preserved. We note that recombination and reassortment in RNA viruses are often considered to be adaptive as they could also increase robustness by purging deleterious mutations from populations [70] [71] [72] .

Here, the relative fitness values for VSV, QB, phiX174, and F1 were calculated as differences in the exponential growth rate. The data on TEV were originally derived by qPCR as in the present study. In this comparative analysis, Sanjuan applied a correction to the TEV data to enable direct comparisons of growth rate. We applied this same correction to our data to transform the values to something resembling an exponential growth rate. The exponential growth rate, r, of influenza A on A549 in a 12 well dish at moi 0.01, is derived from the equation: N t = N 0 e rt , where t = 2 days (48 hour passage), N 0 is 10,000 infectious units (the amount at time 0), and N t is the titer after time t, or 48 hours. For N t , we used the mean of three replicates for HA-40 (9.3e5), which has a fitness of 1 (see Fig 1B) . This is similar to the scaled output of WSN33 that we have observed at different moi and different well sizes. Solving for r gives a value of 2.26 per day. We then applied the following correction from [19] , y = (lnx + r)/r, where y is the relative exponential growth rate of a given mutant, x is the relative fitness measured by qPCR and reported in Tables 1 and 3 , and r is the estimate of the WT exponential growth rate under our experimental conditions (2.26 per day). For example, a fitness of 0.8 in our assay is transformed to a relative exponential growth rate of 0.90. The relative exponential growth rates, as calculated, are reported in S5 Table. We note that using a value 2e6 for N t (which would be roughly consistent with the average dilution factor applied at each passage in many of the competition experiments, gives a growth rate of 2.65 per day and relative exponential growth rate of 0.916 for a virus with a fitness of 0.8.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 69, "end": 73, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1099, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 883, "end": 890, "text": "Fig 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1259, "text": "Tables 1 and 3", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1552, "text": "Table.", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Transformation of fitness into relative growth rate"}, {"text": "All secondary analysis and statistical tests were performed in R and GraphPad Prism6.
