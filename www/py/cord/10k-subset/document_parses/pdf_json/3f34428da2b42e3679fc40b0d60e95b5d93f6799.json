Moreover, we evaluated in-hospital mortality, status after discharge, ventilator-free days (VFDs), ICU-free days (IFDs), and length of hospital stay (LOS). Data definition. Severe sepsis was defined according to the Sepsis-2 criteria, that is, patients who met \u22652 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and patients who had at least one organ dysfunction: systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65 mmHg, or low blood pressure >40 mmHg; serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL or diuresis (urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h); total bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL; platelet count <100,000 cells/mm 3 ; arterial lactate >2 mmoL/L; international normalized ratio >1.5; and arterial hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) <200) with pneumonia or PaO2/ FIO2 <250 without pneumonia). Blood cultures were performed upon arrival to the ICU and analyzed by local laboratories. Bacteremia was defined as the presence of a positive pathogen (except contamination) in blood culture. Contaminated blood culture results and source of infection were clinically determined by each physician in charge. The source of infection was classified into 11 categories: lung, abdomen, urinary tract, soft tissue, central nervous system, intravenous catheter, osteoarticular, endocardium, wound, implant device, and others. Septic shock was defined according to the Sepsis-2 criteria 12 . VFDs was defined as the number of days within the first 28 days after enrollment during which a patient was able to breathe without a ventilator.

We evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe sepsis patients with and without bacteremia. Bacteremia was present in half of the patients with severe sepsis. Outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, VFDs, IFDs, and LOS, were not significantly different among severe sepsis patients with and without bacteremia, although the severity scores were higher in those with bacteremia. characteristics and outcomes of severe sepsis patients with and without bacteremia. Several studies have reported on the epidemiology of bacteremia and sepsis, although the quality of such studies is varied 5, 9, 10, [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the present study, higher rates of septic shock were seen in patients with versus without bacteremia. It is well known that the amount and type of cytokines differ in their severity. For example, cytotoxic cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, are released more frequently in cases of bacteremia 7 . The variety in the production of cytokines that stimulate inflammation may explain the prevalence of septic shock in the bacteremia group. Moreover, detection of bacteremia depends on the amount of bacteria. Bacteremia (amount of bacteria) may have correlated with prognosis or exacerbation of sepsis because there were more septic patients with shock in patients with bacteremia than in those without bacteremia 8 . SOFA score 9 (5-12) 9 (7-11) 9 (7-12) 9 (6-12) 12 (10-13) 11 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) Organ However, in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between patients with and without bacteremia in our study. Previous studies have reported various mortality rates in patients with bacteremia [6] [7] [8] 10, 15 . The diversity of the study population, setting, and study design may have contributed to the different impacts of bacteremia, which may have been influenced by the proportion of patients with each pathogenic species in each study 5, 14 , or evidence of pathogen may have aided in selecting the appropriate antibiotic 16 . Patients with sepsis and bacteremia may have received broad-spectrum antibiotics earlier when compared with patients without bacteremia because patients with bacteremia were in more severe state 9, 16 . Alternatively, as reported in our study, only the most severe cases of bacteremia, such as those in shock, had a higher mortality compared with those without bacteremia. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of bacteremia on patient outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 621, "end": 623, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 624, "end": 626, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 627, "end": 630, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 631, "end": 635, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 636, "end": 640, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 641, "end": 645, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 646, "end": 650, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 958, "end": 959, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1440, "end": 1443, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1447, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1452, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1457, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1462, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1677, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1681, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1685, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1689, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1690, "end": 1692, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1927, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1928, "end": 1930, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2014, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2214, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2217, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Patients with bacteremia had higher concentrations of inflammatory markers, such as PCT, than did those without bacteremia. In the subgroup analysis, in-hospital mortality and inflammatory markers such as PCT varied according to pathogenic species. No clear mechanism exists for these differences in pathogenicity; however, the differences may be associated with the differences in intracellular pathways and cytokines 18 . A previous study reported that patients with gram-negative bacteremia had higher PCT levels compared with those with gram-positive bacteremia 6 . This may be due to a cell wall component, wherein lipopolysaccharides are found in gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acid is found in gram-positive bacteria 19 . It may be difficult to use PCT alone to predict the pathogenic species in the development of sepsis, although it is useful for differentiating gram-negative from gram-positive bacteremia 6 . In addition, severity of sepsis and poor renal function influenced elevated PCT levels 20, 21 .

Our study has some limitations. First, only ICU patients in Japan were enrolled. Our population was relatively old with severe disease, which may account for a higher proportion of bacteremia in Japan when compared with other countries 5, 6 . Second, there were large missing data regarding PCT, which might be affected the results. Third, we did not define the blood culturing methods such as the volume of blood per culture or the methods used to detect bacteremia in each institution. There might have been misclassification with respect to blood culture results because we did not standardize the blood culture methods. This misclassification might have caused underestimation of the association between the presence of bacteremia and clinical outcomes. However, there may be less chance of misclassification because our practice in Japan was relatively homogenous and the compliance rate of obtaining blood cultures was very high 11 . Fourth, we did not follow up the patients after they were discharged from the hospital. Because our outcome was in-hospital mortality, we can only assume that some patients died after being discharged from the hospital. Fifth, the contamination and site of infection were determined based on each physician's judgement. However, there would not be much difference because clinical practices in Japan back then were relatively uniform 11 . Sixth, we categorized pathogens broad major groups such as Staphylococcus spp. regardless of their species or virulence because of small number of each pathogen. Finally, we did not have information about antimicrobial susceptibility and antimicrobial resistance data. However, our previous research 11 showed that the majority of antibiotics we used were broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems and high compliance with 3-h bundles.
