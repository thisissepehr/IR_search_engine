It is necessary to develop biomarkers of immune dysfunction that could help to identify patients at risk of poor outcomes [1] . The decreased expression of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRA is proposed as a major feature of immunodepression and its persistent decrease is associated with mortality in sepsis [2] . In a previous study, we evidenced that FCER1A (Fc Fragment Of IgE Receptor Ia) is the gene showing the lowest expression levels of the entire transcriptome in sepsis [3] . Here we studied the association between FCER1A expression and mortality in infected surgical patients. Methods: FCER1A and HLA-DRA expression levels were quantified by droplet digital PCR in blood of 257 infected surgical patients. 26 patients died within 28 days (10.11%). Spearman test was used to evaluate the association between gene expression and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Areas under Receiver Operating Curves (AUROC) were used to determine the gene expression cut-off values predicting mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were obtained and differences in survival between groups were evaluated using the Log rank test. Cox regression was employed to assess mortality risk at 28 days. Results: Gene expression levels of FCER1A and HLA-DRA correlated inversely with patients' severity (r: -0.5 p<0.001; r: -0.3, p<0.001 respectively). Both genes showed significant AUROCs to predict survival, but FCER1A showed the best accuracy (Fig. 1) . Patients with Introduction: Severe pulmonary and renal conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and deterioration in kidney function often occur in patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The emergence and course of infection is genetically determined, hence host genetic landscape may influence an ability to resist infection. Methods: Variants for genotyping were selected using the PheWAS Catalog which presents genotypic data for 13835 Caucasian patients, 1358 phenotypes and 3144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P < 0.05 [1] . SNPs with the lowest P-values for phenotypes with both, respiratory and renal manifestations were selected: intergenic variants rs7130588 and rs4980785, rs347344 (EDIL3) and rs2470893 (CYP1A1). CYP1A1 gene was associated with pneumonia and ARDS in our previous investigations, so we included in our analysis three sites of CYP1A1 gene (rs2606345, rs4646903 and rs1048943) studied on a smaller sample.

Introduction: An uncontrolled inflammatory response plays a major role in the sepsis related organ dysfunction. Mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) can improve survival of sepsis experimental models by modulating the inflammatory response. Macrophages have been considered as important immune effector cells and their polarization imbalance aggravates the disordered inflammation reaction. The project aims to identify the effects of MSCs on macrophages polarization against dysregulated inflammatory response. Methods: RAW264.7 cells were plated in the lower chambers of transwell system in the presence or absence of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Then, MSCs were seeded in the upper chambers and incubation for different time. Finally, transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) receptor (TGF-\u03b2R) inhibitor was added in transwell system. The phenotype of RAW264.7 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, the levels of inflammatory cytokines were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Our data showed that LPS increased the level of interleukin (IL)-6 in RAW264.7 cells (p<0.001) (Fig. 1 ). In line with IL-6 expression, LPS induced the expression of M1 macrophage (p<0.001). Moreover, LPS stimulated RAW264.7 cells co-culture with MSCs in transwell system, MSCs inhibited the expression of IL-6 and M1 macrophages, while increased M2 macrophages (p<0.001). Compared with LPS group, the concentration of TGF-\u0392 was obviously increased in MSCs treatment groups (p<0.001), furthermore, there were no significantly difference between MSCs directed and indicted groups.

Introduction: Sepsis is dysregulated response to an infection, which can lead to progressive microcirculatory dysfunction, release of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and life-threatening organ dysfunction. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between organ damage -characterized by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, microcirculatory failure and ROI production, in a large animal model of experimental sepsis. Methods: Fecal peritonitis was induced in anesthetized minipigs (n=28; 0.5g/kg autfeces containing 5-9 x10 6 CFU bacteria i.p.), control animals (n=9) received sterile saline i.p. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring and blood gas analyses were performed between 16-24 hrs, the signs for failure of circulatory, respiratory and urinary systems were evaluated in accordance with the SOFA score. The microcirculatory perfusion rate in the sublingual region was measured by orthogonal polarization spectral imaging technique (Cytoscan A/R).

The microcirculation was significantly deteriorated in all cases, independently of SOFA score data.

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to characterize differences in sepsis management in patients with and without left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Septic patients with LV dysfunction have higher mortality, and limited guidance exists for sepsis management of patients with LV dysfunction.

Patients were divided into two groups: reduced ejection fraction (EF) of < 40% and preserved EF defined as EF \u226540%. Information about patient outcomes and sepsis management were collected.

Conclusions: No significant differences were observed with regard to sepsis management, reflecting current guidelines. The significantly increased need for MV is a provocative result.

However, studies on repeated measures of HBP are lacking. Our objective was to describe the kinetics of plasma HBP during septic shock and correlate it to hemodynamic parameters. Methods: We included patients with septic shock (sepsis-3) on admission to Helsingborg hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) during September 2016 to February 2018. Patients were sampled from ICU admission and every 4 hours for 72 hours or until death or ICU discharge. The plasma samples were analyzed for HBP and converted using the natural log (lnHBP) for normality. lnHBP was then evaluated against mean arterial pressure (MAP) as primary analysis and against systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) as a secondary analysis, using mixed-effects linear regression models, treating patient id as a random intercept and adjusting for hemodynamic parameters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 128, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Results: A total of 22 patients were included with median age 67 years, 9 females (41%), 7 surgical admissions (32%), median SOFA-score 12 points on day one and 6 deaths from all causes within 90 days (27%).

Introduction: Study of the expression of cell free DNA (cfDNA) in the search for new biomarkers for infection, sepsis and septic shock. Methods: The population studied was all patients included in the sepsis protocol from March 2017 to January 2018, hospitalized patients of a federal public hospital. Plasma samples were collected for quantification of cfDNA, which after centrifugation were stored at -80\u00b0C and then thawed and analyzed by fluorescence using a Varioskan Flash fluorometer). CfDNA values were expressed as ng/mL. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Infection and sepsis/septic shock. We analyzed mortality, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA score), qSOFA (quick SOFA), comorbidities, cfDNA and laboratory parameters of 111 patients. Results: Among the 111 patients, 28% were classified as infection and 72% sepsis/septic shock. Overall lethality was 33%, infection 9.7%, and sepsis/septic shock 42.5% (p<0.001). The mean of cfDNA, SOFA and lactate was higher according to the classification of infection and sepsis/septic shock: CfDNA (159.4\u00b1117.3 and 282.7\u00b1358.6, p=0.006), SOFA (1.9\u00b12.1 and 6.6\u00b14.3, p<0.001), QSOFA (positive in 25% and 75%, lactate (1.6\u00b10.8 and 3.8\u00b13.5, p<0.001). We analyzed leukocytes, creatinine, CRP (C reactive protein), INR (International Normalized Ratio), as predictors of severity and only CRP showed no association with disease severity (P=0.84).

Sepsis has been classically defined as the exuberant, harmful, pro-inflammatory response to infection. This concept is changing [1] and the presence of a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection is now considered a central event in the pathogenesis of sepsis [2] . Methods: LCN2 expression levels were quantified by ddPCR in blood of a total of 257 surgical patients with a diagnosis of infection. Spearman analysis was used to evaluate if LCN2 correlated in a significant manner with SOFA score. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) analysis and multivariate regression analysis were employed to test the ability of LCN2 to identify organ failure and mortality risk. Results: Spearman analysis showed that there was a positive, significant correlation between LCN2 expression levels and SOFA score (Fig. 1) . AUROCs analysis showed that LCN2 presents a good diagnostic accuracy to detect organ failure and mortality risk (Fig 2) . In the multivariate regression analysis, patients showing LCN2 expression levels over the Optimal Operating Points (OOPs) identified in the AUROCs showed a higher risk of developing organ failure (Table 1) and a higher mortality risk (Table 2) . Conclusions: Quantifying LCN2 expression levels by ddPCR is a promising approach to improve organ failure detection and mortality risk in surgical patients with infection. Introduction: Sepsis is an inflammatory state due to an exacerbated immune response against infection. In cancer patients, sepsis presents a 10-fold higher mortality than in general population and leads to longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay.

Introduction: Cytovale has developed a rapid biophysical assay of the host immune response which can serve as a rapid and reliable indicator of sepsis. Neutrophils and monocytes undergo characteristic structural and morphologic changes in response to infection. One type of response is the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), these have been proposed as potential mediators for widespread tissue damage. During NETosis there is a fundamental reorganization of a cell's chromatin structurea signal that we have shown is sensitively measured by the Cytovale cytometer. We hypothesized that quantification of plasticity (deformability) of leukocytes in the peripheral blood provides an early indicator of sepsis. The Cytovale assay uses microfluidic cytometry to measure the plasticity of up to 100,000 white blood cells from EDTA-anticoagulated, peripherally-collected whole blood and provides a result in 5 minutes. Methods: In two prospective studies conducted in two academic medical centers in Baton Rouge, LA, the Cytovale test was performed on peripheral blood samples obtained from 500 patients who presented to the emergency department with signs or symptoms suggestive of infection.

Introduction: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a serum biomarker suggested by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign to aid in determination of the appropriate duration of therapy in septic patients. Trauma patients have a high prevalence of septic complications, often difficult to distinguish from inflammatory response. PCT values typically declined after 72h from trauma and increased only during secondary systemic bacterial infections. The aims of the study are to evaluate reliability and usefulness of PCT serum concentration in trauma. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 40 trauma patients admitted to ICU at Bufalini Hospital -Cesena, from July 2017 to August 2018. We collected data about antimicrobial therapy, Injury severity score (ISS), first arterial Lactate in emergency room, SOFA score and Sepsis severity. Plasma PCT concentration was measured using an automate analyzer (Modular E-Brahms) on 1st day of antimicrobial therapy and every 48h hours. Antimicrobial therapy was stopped according to a local protocol; however medical judgment was considered the overriding point for therapeutic decision. Results: Median ISS of patients was 33.5, inter quartile range (IQR) 13.5. PCT mean concentration at the starting of antimicrobial treatment was 13.07 \u03bcg/L (d.s 40.1), median 0.72 (IQR 10.13). No significative correlation (Spearman\u00b4s Rho Test) was found between PCT at day 1 of antimicrobial therapy and ISS (Rho -0.186), between first arterial Lactate in ER and PCT (Rho 0.158). Daily course of PCT was not related to distance from trauma (Rho -0.116). In 21 of 40 patients (52.2 %) PCT measurement led physician to save days of antimicrobial therapy compared with standard clinical practice. We couldn\u00b4t find any cut off value.

We have previously described a blood-based 11-gene influenza meta-signature (IMS) score to differentiate influenza from bacterial and other viral respiratory infections. Methods: We prospectively validated the IMS in a multi-site validation study by recruiting 654 individuals (608 patients with suspected influenza, 46 healthy controls) in 10 community or hospital clinics across Australia. We assayed the IMS and 15 genes from viral genome of 3 influenza strains to generate the Blood Flu Score (BFS) as a measure of viremia using Nanostring from whole blood RNA. Results: Using clinically determined phenotypes, the IMS score distinguished patients with influenza from healthy (AUC=0.95), non-infected (AUC=0.83), bacterial (AUC=0.88), other viruses (AUC=0.77) ( Figure 1A) . Interestingly, probes of BFS were found in all phenotypic groups (non-infected, bacterial, and other viral infections) to varying degrees, and positively correlate with the IMS score (r=0.53). IMS AUROCs improve when the BFS is used to inform the phenotypic groups: healthy (AUC=0.92), non-infected (AUC=0.90), bacterial (AUC=0.93), other viruses (AUC=0.88) ( Figure  1B ). Patients who were clinically influenza negative but had a high IMS and BFS were admitted less often, yet had~4-fold higher mortality than those who were clinically influenza negative with low IMS and no BFS (Table 1) . Conclusions: Collectively, our prospective multi-center validation of the IMS demonstrates its potential in diagnosis of influenza infections.

Vitamin C is a cellular antioxidant, it increases eNOS and decreases NF-kB; it has several immune-enhancing effects and is crucial for endogenous vasopressors synthesis.

Introduction: Circulating cell-free neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) would induce a microcirculatory disturbance of sepsis. The removal of NETs remnants from the circulation could reduce NETs-dependent tissue injury. To address this issue, we evaluated the effect of hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B cartridge (PMX-DHP; Toray, Japan), which was originally developed for the treatment in patients with Gram-negative bacterial infection, on circulating cell-free NETs in patients with septic shock and in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated neutrophils obtained from healthy volunteer. Methods: Ex vivo closed loop hemoperfusion was performed through a circuit formed by connecting the small PMX module to a tube and a peristalsis pump. Whole blood from healthy volunteers incubated with or without PMA or from septic shock patients were applied to circuit and perfused. Blood was collected at 0, 1 and 2 hr after perfusion. Circulating cell-free NETs were assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO)-, neutrophil elastase (NE)-, and cell free (cf)-DNA. Results: Plasma MPO-DNA, NE-DNA and cf-DNA levels were significantly increased at 2 hr after PMA stimulation when compared with plasma levels without PMA. When either blood from septic shock patients or PMA-stimulated neutrophils obtained from volunteers were applied to circuit, circulating MPO-DNA, NE-DNA and cf-DNA were significantly reduced in perfusion with PMX filter than in perfusion without PMX filter at times 1 and 2 hr. Conclusions: In the ex vivo experiments, MPO-DNA, NE-DNA and cf-DNA were found to decrease after ex vivo perfusion through PMX filters.

Aim of this study was to examine whether the adsorption-therapy could influence patient-outcome with catecholamine resistant septic shock (CRSS) and acute renal failure(ARV). Furhtermore we tried to identify clinical constellations that would predict an effective use of adsorbers [ 7, 34] . Initial IL-6 in patients with catecholamine-reduction through adsorption was non-significantly different to those with no reduction (2376 ng/l [838, 5000] vs. 5000 ng/l [3488, 5000]). Mortality did not differ significantly between the groups (71% vs 79%). Length of intensive care unit stay (LOS) did differ significantly (13 days [4, 24] vs 22 days [19, 29] ). Conclusions: IL-6 can be reduced with adsorption. Patients with catecholamine-reduction did not differ in regard to their initial IL-6. LOS was shorter for patients treated with adsorption. According to our experience adsorption can be taken into consideration when CRSS is beginning. Introduction: In our Intensive Care Unit (ICU), we have already started expanded application to the contact precautions. Applied patients are; 1) Emergency admission, 2) Patients who had already had bacteria* that are required to contact precautions, 3) Scheduled surgical patients with prolonged ICU stay, although we have not yet decided the started period of expanded application exactly. *Detected Bacteria(DB);MRSA, CD, MDRP, ESBL, Pseudomonas A, PISP, PRSP, VRSA. The aim of this study was to determine the adequate starting period of expanded application to the contact precautions in the scheduled surgical patients in the mixed ICU. Methods: We performed retrospective observational study on 4221 patients who were admitted to our ICU after planed surgery from May 2013 to Dec. 2017. We detected the patients who acquired BD newly and investigated the relation to the length of ICU stay. The relationship between detection rate and categorized date was also analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, APACHE2, and SOFA score. Using Youden\u00b4s index and ROC curve, we also calculated cutoff point of the duration of ICU stay related to detection rate. Finally, we made the logistic regression model of each cutoff day(day1 to 7) and compared Odds Ratio(OR) and AUC of each models using stata. Results: Category day 2 or more, especially day 4 or more had significantly higher detection rate of DB compared to day 1 ( Results: PaO2/FiO2 was lower than 240 mmHg in 171 (67%) patients. Compared to patients in group 2, patients in group 1 were less severely ill at admission but presented a higher SOFA and CPIS score and a greater incidence of ARDS and shock at pneumonia onset (Fig 1) . 117 (69%) patients in group 1 had a microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia, compared to 71 patients (85%) in group 2 (p=0.007). PaO2/FIO2 \u2264240 mmHg was associated with less probability of having microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79, p=0.008). When adjusted for other variables significantly associated with positive microbiology, PaO2/FIO2 \u2264240 mmHg remained significantly associated with less probability of a microbiological diagnosis (adjusted OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.94, p=0.038). Hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients in group 1 compared to group 2 (42% vs 29%, p=0.044). However, no difference was found in non-response to treatment, ICU and hospital stay, ICU mortality (Table 1) and 90-days survival (Fig 2) . Conclusions: A significant higher number of patients with VAP didn't have a definitive etiological diagnosis when using the proposed threshold criteria of PaO2/FIO2 \u2264240 mmHg. PaO2/FiO2 ratio does not seem a good predictor of etiology in patients with VAP. Introduction: Immunological dysfunction is common in critically ill patients but the optimal method to measure it and its clinical significance are unknown. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) after ex-vivo whole blood stimulation with lipopolysaccharide has been proposed as a possible method to quantitate immunological function. We hypothesized that patients with a lower post-stimulation TNF-\u03b1 level would have increased rates of nosocomial infections (NIs) and worse clinical outcomes. Methods: A secondary analysis of a phase 2 randomized, multicentre, double-blinded placebo controlled trial [1] . There were no differences in allocation groups; all the patients were analyzed as one cohort. On enrolment, whole blood was incubated with LPS ex-vivo and TNF-\u03b1 level was measured.

All seven were modified Hodge test (MHT) negative making probability of blaKPC unlikely. In resource limited setting, analysis beyond MHT could only be performed for CR-KP samples. 2/7 samples belonging to CR-KP isolates produced the blaNDM-1 whilst 5/7 CR-KP isolates did not produce either blaKPC or blaNDM carbapenemases prompting hypothesis of blaOXA-48 or blaVIM as the causative factor.

Ceftazidimeavibactam has in-vitro activity against Gram-negative organisms producing class A, class C and some class D beta-lactamases. We carried out a qualitative analysis to assess the safety and efficacy outcomes of the Indian population cohorts involved in the RE-PROVE and RECLAIM trials. Methods: In line with the global REPROVE protocol, Indian patients enrolled in the study with NP, were randomly assigned (1:1) to 2000 mg ceftazidime and 500 mg avibactam or 1000 mg meropenem. In the RECLAIM study, Indian patients with a diagnosis of cIAI were enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg of ceftazidime and 500 mg of avibactam) followed by metronidazole (500 mg); or meropenem (1000 mg). The primary efficacy outcome measure in the REPROVE and RECLAIM studies was clinical cure rate of CAZ-AVI compared with that of meropenem at TOC (test-of-cure) visit in pre-defined analysis sets. In both studies, Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower limit of the twosided 95% CI for the treatment difference was greater than -12\u00b75% in the primary analysis sets. As the Indian subset study was not statistically powered to detect a difference in the subgroup, we descriptively analysed the efficacy results in the Indian population and compared them with the overall results in the global trial. In addition, the study also analysed the safety of CAZ-AVI in the Indian patients by monitoring the number and severity of adverse events. Introduction: Early administration of effective intravenous antimicrobials is recommended for the management of the patients with sepsis. Although Meropenem (MEPM) is one of the first-line drugs in patients with sepsis because of its broad spectrum, the optimal dose in the critical care settings especially during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has not been established since therapeutic drug monitoring of MEPM has not been popular. Methods: Eighteen critically ill patients who received CRRT were enrolled in this study. One gram of MEPM was administered over 1 hour, every 12 hours, and blood samples at 1, 2, 6, 9 and 12 hours after administration were collected on day 1, 2 and 5. All samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. The measurement of the blood concentration of MEPM was performed using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV Introduction: Meningitis is one of the complications of severe traumatic brain injury, and it is often associated with encephalitis (incidence from 1.3-4.8% to 10-20%). The aim of the investigation was to study the dynamics of the concentration of meropenem in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with intravenous and intrathecal administration of meropenem. Methods: In eight patients with bacterial meningoencephalitis blood serum and CSF were studied prior to the administration of meropenem and 5-10 min, 1, 2.5 and 5 hrs after it. Antibiotic regimen: 2000 mg of vancomycin (1000 mg BID) and meropenem (2000 mg TID diluted in 100 ml of saline IV + 20 mg BID diluted in 5 ml of saline bolus slowly intrathecally). Meropenem infusion was carried out for 30 minutes, 5 mins after it 5 ml of blood and 1 ml of CSF were sampled.

However, their beneficial role in VAP prevention remains inconclusive. Our aim was to delineate the efficacy of probiotics for both VAP prophylaxis and restriction of ICU-acquired infections in multi-trauma patients. Methods: Randomized, placebo-controlled study enrolling 58 multitrauma patients, requiring mechanical ventilation for >10 days. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either probiotic (n=28) or placebo (n=30) treatment. A four-probiotic formula was applied and each patient received two capsules per day from Day1 to Day15 post ICU admission. The content of one capsule was given as an aqueous suspension by nasogastric tube, while the other one was spread to the oropharynx after being mixed up with water-based lubricant. The follow-up period was 30 days, while ICU stay and mortality were also assessed. ], while no difference in 30-day mortality rate was identified between groups (10.7% probiotics vs 6.7% placebo).

Methods: machine learning model of IHS is developed and validated via porcine induced bleed experiment. 36 healthy sedated Yorkshire pigs first had one 20mL rapid blood draw during a stable period, and then were bled at 20mL/min to mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 30 mmHg. 10 subjects had IHS defined as MAP<20mmHg.

Funding: CRC1149 Introduction: Septic shock is one of the main causes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, leading to mortality up to 50% of patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently occurs and is associated to great morbidity and mortality. Hemodynamic optimization may reduce the incidence of AKI, but the use of vasopressors to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP) could have deleterious effect on renal perfusion. We aimed at investigating the effect of MAP and norepinephrine (NE) on the incidence of AKI in septic shock patients Methods: Retrospective study based on prospectively collected data on digital medical records (Digistat) at our ICU. Introduction: In patients with distributive shock, increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) to a target of >65 mmHg can improve tissue perfusion. Patients unable to achieve the target MAP of >65 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation as well as catecholamines and vasopressin standard care (SC), may benefit from the noncatecholamine vasopressor angiotensin II to increase MAP. This posthoc analysis examined whether patients from the ATHOS-3 study with a baseline (BL) MAP <65 mmHg and treated with SC plus either angiotensin II (Ang II) or placebo achieved a MAP of >65 mmHg for 3 consecutive hours, without increasing the dose of SC therapy. Methods: Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ang II or placebo, plus SC. Randomization was stratified according to MAP (<65 or >65 mmHg) at screening. In patients with BL MAP <65 mmHg, we evaluated whether patients achieved a MAP of >65 mmHg for the first 3 hours after initiation (MAP measurements taken at hours 1, 2, and 3), without an increase in the dose of SC. Results: Among 321 treated patients, 102 had BL MAP <65 mmHg (Ang II, 52; placebo, 50). Median BL MAP (IQR) was 61 (57-63) and 62 (59-64) mmHg for placebo and Ang II groups, respectively. Patients with BL MAP <65 mmHg who were treated with Ang II were more likely to achieve MAP \u226565 mmHg for 3 consecutive hours after initiation without an increase in SC dose (67%, 95%CI 53-80), compared with placebo-treated patients (24%, 95%CI 13-38, OR=6.52, p<0.0001). Conclusions: In this post-hoc analysis of patients with BL MAP <65 mmHg, patients receiving Ang II plus SC were significantly more likely to achieve a MAP >65 mmHg for the first 3 consecutive hours after initiation than patients receiving SC only.

This effect may be added to the ones of fluids when both are administered in septic shock. Nevertheless, it could be imagined that NE potentiates in a synergetic way the efficacy of volume expansion on venous return by reducing venous capacitance, reducing the distribution volume of fluids and enhancing the induced increase in stressed blood volume. The purpose of this study was to test if the increase in Psm induced by a preload challenge were enhanced by NE. Methods: This prospective study had included 30 septic shock adults. To reversibly reproduce a volume expansion and preload increase at different doses of NE, we mimicked fluid infusion through a passive leg raising (PLR). In patients in which the decrease of NE was planned, we estimated Psm (using respiratory occlusions) at baseline and during a PLR test (PLR High ). The dose of NE was then decreased and Psm was estimated again before and during a second PLR (PLR Low ). . The increase in cardiac index induced by PLR Low was significantly greater than that induced by PLR High (p<0.001). \u0394 PsmHigh -\u0394 PsmLow was moderately correlated with the diastolic arterial pressure at Baseline-High (p=0.03, r=0.41) and with the NE-induced change in mean arterial pressure (p=0.004, r=0.57). Conclusions: NE enhances the increase in Psm induced by a PLR, which mimics a fluid infusion. This suggests that it may potentiate the effects of fluid in a synergetic way in septic shock patients. This may decrease the amount of administered fluids and contribute to decrease the cumulative fluid balance. Introduction: Arginine vasopressin (AVP) can be used in addition to norepinephrine (NE) for NE-resistant septic shock. However, a subgroup who will response to AVP is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine factors which could predict the response to AVP in patients with NE-resistant hypotension. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective analysis of patients who administered AVP for NE-resistant hypotension in our intensive care units (ICUs). Eligible patients were adult patients who administered AVP in addition to NE due to hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 65) in our ICUs between August 2014 and December 2017. We divided all patients into two groups by response to AVP; responders and non-responders. The responders were defined as an increase of MAP \u2265 10 mmHg at 1h after AVP initiation. We conducted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to evaluate the effect of variables on AVP response. Results: A total of 163 patients were included; 107 responders (66%), 56 non-responders (34%). There was no significant difference for MAP at the time of AVP initiation (51 vs 52 mmHg; p = 0.40), initiation dose of AVP (0.028 vs 0.031 U/min; p = 0.67), and dose of NE at the time of AVP initiation (0.18 vs 0.18 \u03bc g/kg/min; p = 0.95). MAP at 1h after AVP initiation was significantly higher in responders than non-responders (74 vs 55 mmHg; p < 0.01).

The multivariate logistic analysis revealed that HR \u2264 103 (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.29-5.10, p < 0.01), lactate \u2264 3 (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.56-6.19, p < 0.01) and age \u2265 63 (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.05-4.45, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with the response to AVP.

To improve the management of this subgroup, the knowledge of early indicator is needed. We hypothesize that maximum norepinephrine dosage on the initial day of treatment is useful to predict early death in septic shock. Methods: In this retrospective single-center observational study, septic shock patients admitted to the emergency intensive care unit (ICU) of an academic medical center between April 2011 and March 2017 were included. Cardiac arrest before ICU admission and those with do-not-resuscitate orders before admission were excluded. The maximum dosage of norepinephrine initial 24 hours of ICU admission (MD24) was used to assess 7-day mortality. Results: One-hundred-fifty-two patients were included in this study. Median SOFA score was 11 (9-13), and median MD 24 was 0.24 (0.16-0.38) mcg/kg/min. Vasopressin and steroid were administered in 58 (38 %) and 67 (44 %) cases. Nineteen patients (13 %) died within a week. Non-survivors had higher MD24, higher SOFA score, and higher rate of vasopressin use.

Right ventricle performance could be impaired in sepsis. The effects of norepinephrine on RV performance and afterload in septic shock are not immediately evident. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of norepinephrine on RV systolic function, RV afterload and pulmonary haemodynamics. Methods: Eleven, volume-resuscitated and mechanically ventilated patients with norepinephrine-dependent septic shock were included. Infusion of norepinephrine was randomly and sequentially titrated to target mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 60, 75 and 90 mmHg. At each target MAP, strain-and conventional echocardiographic were performed. The pulmonary haemodynamic variables were measured by using a pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter. The RV afterload was assessed by calculating the effective pulmonary arterial elastance (Epa) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI). Results: The norepinephrine-induced elevation of MAP increased central venous pressure (38%, p<0.001), stroke volume index (7%, p<001), mean pulmonary artery pressure (19%, p<0.001) and RV stroke work (20%, p=0.045), while neither pulmonary vascular resistance index nor Epa was affected.

Grant FONDECYT Chile 1170043 Introduction: Shock patients often become resistant to catecholamines which often require the addition of a non-catecholamine vasopressor. Preclinical studies suggest that in the presence of aadrenoceptor antagonism, the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system exerts the major vasopressor influence. We sought to determine the effects of AngII or Lypressin (LYP [porcine vasopressin]) on blood pressure in a norepinephrine (NE)-resistant hypotension pig model. Methods: Phentolamine (PHN), a reversible \u03b1-blocker that antagonizes the vasoconstriction by NE, was continuously infused to induce hypotension. After NE-resistant hypotension was established, LYP or AngII was then co-infused with PHN. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate were continuously recorded (Fig. 1) . Results: As shown in Fig. 2 Conclusions: In a background of \u03b1-adrenoceptor blockade, at clinically comparable doses, the vasopressor effect of Ang II was maintained while those of NE and LYP were attenuated. These data suggest that the blood pressure effect of vasopressin-like peptides may require a functioning \u03b1-adrenoceptor. Patients with shock who are resistant to increasing doses of catecholamines may also have vasopressin resistance potentially making angiotensin II a preferred vasopressor for these patients.

Her systolic blood pressure (SBP) suddenly dropped to 40mmHg with massive hematochezia at that night, and did not increase despite resuscitation with blood products, crystalloid and norepinephrine. To buy time until measures for stop bleeding, we planned to place REBOA in the ICU. Following the placement of a sheath in the left femoral artery, we tried to place a 7 Fr intra-aortic balloon occlusion catheter, which unintentionally and repeatedly went into the right common iliac artery because her left femoral artery was tortuous. After compressing the right lower abdomen, we managed to introduce REBOA in Zone 1. It took approximately 60 minutes to successfully place the catheter. The patient's SBP increased immediately after the balloon inflation and bleeding was endoscopically controlled.

We aim to determine whether LMCA is definitive risk factor for prolonged ICU stay as a primary outcome and whether LMCA is definitive risk factor for early morbidity Methods: Retrospective descriptive study with purposive sampling analyzing 398 patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass surgeries (CABG). Patients were divided into 2 groups those with LMCA disease as group 1 (75 patients) and those with coronary arty disease requiring surgery but without LMCA disease as group 2 (324 patients) then we will correlate with ICU outcome parameters including ICU stay length, postoperative atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, re-exploration, perioperative myocardial infarction, post operative bleeding and early mortality. Results: Patients with LMS had significantly higher diabetes prevalence (43.3% vs 29%, p=0.001).

Introduction: Multimorbidity in patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction [AMI] is associated with higher risk for in-hospital mortality and adverse clinical outcomes. We investigated to what extent an increasing number of comorbidities affects the age-stratified excess risk of death and other clinical outcomes among patients with myocardial infarction. Methods: We analyzed nationwide administrative data of 174`803 admissions for an acute myocardial infarction between 2006 and 2016. We calculated multivariate regression models to study the association of four comorbidities (chronic kidney disease [CKD], diabetes mellitus, heart failure [HF], and atrial fibrillation) and excess risk of in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay [LOS] , and 30-day readmission and stratified the analysis for different age categories. Results: The incidence of admissions for AMI increased continuously during the observed decade without an increase in in-hospital mortality, LOS, and 30-day readmission. Among admitted patients with AMI, there was a stepwise increase in risk for adverse outcomes for each comorbidity. Compared to patients with no comorbidity, patients with 4 comorbidities had 6-fold increased risk for mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6 to 7.7) and a similar risk for readmission (OR 1.0, CI 0.9 to 1.2). The LOS was 5.3 days (CI 5.1 to 5.5) in patients with no comorbidity and increased by 2.5 days (CI 2.4 to 2.5) with each additional comorbidity.

Introduction: Certified cardiac arrest centers, sophisticated post cardiac arrest care and prehospital ECLS teams aim to increase survivor rates with a preferable neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. Centers also provide emergency ECLS and ECLS pick ups for cardiogenic shock patients before arresting. Few data answer the question of the long-term quality of life after ECLS therapy. Methods: In a retrospective single center register we included patients after emergency ECLS (eCPR and cardiogenic shock) between 10/2010 and 10/2017 discharged alive and performed a follow-up after 2 years on average at 6/2018. In our center criteria to initiate ECLS therapy in cardiogenic shock or under cardiac arrest are an observed collaps, shockable rhythm, absence of frailty and severe comorbidities. All patients were requested to take part in a telephone interview. Thus, we analyzed survival, CPC scores and SF36 scores. Results: 97 patients with hospital survival after ECLS were screened. 44% (N=43) had survived until 6/2018; 38 patients were not accessible; 16 had ceased. 33 survivors (mean\u00b1SD; min-max; 53\u00b117; 19-78 years, 8 women) answered SF36 questionaires 29\u00b115; 7-64 months after ECLS (45% cardiogenic shock, 55% eCPR with shockable rhythm in 89%). The participants\u0106 PC scores were in median 1. The results of the SF36 were physical functioning 84\u00b121, physical role functioning 84\u00b128, bodily pain 92\u00b117, general health 68\u00b123, vitality 65\u00b126, social role functioning 83\u00b128, emotional role functioning 96\u00b114 and mental health 81\u00b122. Survivors who did not take part at the SF36 had a CPC score of in median 2 (N=10, 5 personally signed refusals, 3 language barriers, 2 vegetative states). Conclusions: After emergency ECLS therapy and hospital survival 44% of our patients survived the following 2 years up to over 5 years with a preferable neurological outcome and a general mentally and physically satisfactory quality of life. A vague outcome in 39% limits the results of our study. Introduction: Successful weaning from VA-ECMO requires the restoration of a sufficient cardiac function to ensure an adequate tissue perfusion. Skin blood flow (SBF) is among the first to deteriorate during circulatory shock and the last to be restored after resuscitation. SBF would be a good predictor of successful weaning from VA-ECMO. Methods: Patients with VA-ECMO, who required a first weaning attempt, were included. Weaning procedure (WP) was performed by a reduction of VA-ECMO blood flow to 1 L/min for 10 minutes. The weaning criterion was an aortic velocity-time integral (VTI) > 10 cm. Successful weaning from VA-ECMO was defined as hemodynamic stabilization and without the need to increase the vasopressor dose during the next 24 hours. SBF, assessed by skin laser Doppler (Peri-flux5000, Perimed, right index finger); perfusion unit: PU), together with global hemodynamic parameters were obtained before and after 3 min of weaning. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were generated to assess the ability and reliability of baseline parameters to predict a successful weaning. Results: We studied 22 WPs in patients with VA-ECMO for pulmonary embolism (n = 2), post cardiotomy (n = 3), acute coronary syndrome (n = 14), myocarditis (n = 3). These were successful (SW) in 12 and unsuccessful (NSW) in 10. At baseline, hemodynamic variables, lactate, ECMO blood flow were similar in both groups (Table1). SBF was greater in SW than NSW patients (Table1). During WP, CI rose from baseline and was similar in SW and NSW (p=0.1) ( Table 2 ). VTIs were higher in SW than NSW (13 (12-14) vs 8 (6-8), respectively, p=0.03). SBF decreased in SW and remained low in NSW (Table 2) . From the ROC curves analyses, baseline SBF had the highest area under the ROC curve with a cut off \u2265 34 PU (sensitivity 83%, specificity 92%) (Figure1). Conclusions: SBF is a good predictor of successful weaning from VA-ECMO Introduction: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is defined as a temporarily decline in cognition associated with surgery. Long-term POCD (3 months after surgery) occurs in 10-30% of cardiac patients and is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality.

We apply a novel machine learning method to analyze CVP datasets to characterize bleeding in a porcine model of fixed rate blood loss. Methods: Thirty-eight pigs were anesthetized, instrumented with catheters, kept stable for 30 minutes, and bled at a constant rate of 20ml/min to mean arterial pressure of 30 mmHg. CVP waveforms were extracted from inspiration and expiration phases of respiration and statistically featurized. The proposed machine learning method, Canonical Least Squares (CLS) clustering, identifies correlation structures that differ between subsets of observations. We extend it to supervised classification. Both clustering and classification methods yield human-interpretable models that reflect distinctive patterns of correlations within CVP waveforms. Results: We conducted three experiments to discover structure in the physiological response to bleeding. First, we clustered respiration cycles with full knowledge of blood loss. The color-coded cluster assignments are shown in the Figure 1 . They are consistent with escalation of bleeding. Second, we deployed clustering on only CVP features without blood loss.

The contribution of this component for fluid resuscitation in children can add a significant quantity to total estimated fluid requirements. For example, in a child who is 10 kilograms with a 25% burn, the maintenance fluid requirement is 1000 mls per 24 hours and the resuscitation component per Parkland's will be 4 x 10 x 25%=1000 mls.

When individual subjects were evaluated over time, 100% of subjects who became FR only after 24 hours showed evidence of LV/RV dysfunction ( Figure 2 ). Conclusions: Fluid responsiveness or preload dependence frequently changes for septic shock patients over the first 72 hours of care. Evidence suggests it is beneficial to periodically perform an assessment of preload responsiveness to guide fluid administration, as preload dependence is a dynamic and changing state. Preload dependence provides additional information beyond fluid responsiveness. Those patients who remain primarily fluid non-responsive (preload independent) are more likely to demonstrate ECHO confirmed LV/RV dysfunction, as the delay in return to cardiac function may be related to underlying cardiac deficits. Further evaluation may be indicated in preload independent patients. Introduction: Hydroxyethyl Starch (HES), a synthetic colloid, has been used as a volume expander, and is associated with renal impairment in patients with sepsis. However, a small dose of HES (6%, 130/0.4) has sometimes been used in acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, we investigated whether a small dose of HES was linked with renal deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: A consecutive 524 patients with acute ischemic stroke within 7 days from onset were included between January 2012 and May 2016 (Fig 1) . We collected admission serum creatinine (SCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and renal function was assessed using KDIGO definition of acute kidney injury on hospital days 5 to 9 as to patient's hospitalization period. is crucial for venous return and volaemic status, and as such it is a useful parameter in physiology and clinical settings alike. We tested whether: Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) could be effective at measuring MSFP both in healthy individuals and in conditions with a rise in interstitial pressures; after an occlusion pressure is relieved, the decrease in venular blood volume could allow calculation of \u03c4 (time constant) and thus Venous Resistances (Rv). In order to verify these hypotheses we used a forearm NIRS probe on healthy individuals at rest and during different degrees of Maximal Voluntary Contraction (MVC). Methods: 10 healthy subjects volunteered in the study that took place at Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome (Italy). All subjects had venular pressures and volumes assessed via a NIRS probe positioned on the forearm using a pressure-cuff in steps of 5 mmHg from 0 to 50 mmHg, at rest and at 10% and 20% MVC. For each patient MSFP, unstressed Volume (Vu) and stressed Volume (Vs) were measured. A temporary 30 mmHg occlusion was obtained and volume time course was calculated upon release, to derive \u03c4 . Results: P-V relationship was found to have a 3-slopes shape reflecting venular network changes. We measured Vu, Vs, and obtained MSFP values of 6.74 \u00b1 1.83 mmHg, p<0.001; during exercise no changes in Vu and Vs were noted but MSFP values rose; value was found to be 2.9 \u00b1 0.1 sec at rest and 0.9 \u00b1 0.03 sec after exercise, reflecting a reduction in Rv.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 250, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 395, "end": 403, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1639, "text": "(Fig 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "P141"}, {"text": "Conclusions: NIRS measurements on healthy subject may have implications in the clinical assessment of critical care patients where changes in interstitial pressure are possible.

Introduction: Hemorrhage is the most common cause of trauma deaths and the most frequent complication of major surgery. It is difficult to identify until profound blood loss has already occurred. We aim at detecting hemorrhage early and reliably using waveform vital sign data routinely collected before, during, and after surgery. Methods: We use waveform vital sign data collected at 250 Hz during a controlled transition from a stable (non-bleeding) to a fixed bleeding state of 93 pigs. These vital signs include airway, arterial, central venous and pulmonary arterial pressures, venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), pulse oximetry pleth and ECG heartrate, continuous CO, and stroke volume variation (LiDCO). We used Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and dilated, causal, one-dimensional convolutional neural (Table 1) . However, outside of the very low FPR range (cf. ROCs in Fig. 1 and 2), our models appear inferior to a referenced Random Forest (RF) classifier.

The scanning was performed by trained emergency physicians. The longitudinal scan done at the recommended 6 zones of both left and right lungs and the total number of B-lines identified were summed up as the comet score. Comet Score of 0, 1, 2 and 3 were categorised based on amount of Blines of less than 5, 5-15, 15-30 and more than 30 B-lines respectively.

Methods: In anesthetized pigs, CO 2 -sensors and microdialysis catheters are inserted into the parenchyma or attached to the surface of the pancreas. PCO 2 is measured continuously and lactate is sampled with microdialysis every 15 min. Ischemia is induced by sequential arterial and venous occlusions for 45 minutes, with 120 minutes of reperfusion in between.

We aim to validate a recently developed advanced computer vision algorithm [1] versus manual analysis in a wide spectrum of populations and contexts. Methods: Our collaborators were invited to contribute raw data of published or ongoing institutional review board approved work. Inclusion criteria were use of the Cytocam HVM device, manual analysis with the AVA software, and image quality as independently assessed by Massey score of <10 in >50% of recordings in a random subset of each study. 233 subjects from 11 studies were included, covering clinical and experimental populations, major shock forms and interventions to recruit the microcirculation (Table 1) . Results: 2,599,710 red blood cells were tracked by the algorithm across 150,163 frames in 1462 measurements in real time. A good to excellent correlation was found between algorithm-determined and manual capillary density (p<0.0001, r 0.6-0.9, Figure 1 ). Capillary perfusion was classified using space-time diagram derived red blood cell velocity (RBCv), yielding good correlation with manual analysis for functional capillary density und proportion of perfused vessels. Microcirculatory alterations during disease and interventions were equally detected by the algorithm and manual analysis. Change in flow short of severe abnormality was reflected in absolute RBCv but not microcirculatory flow index. Conclusions: We demonstrate the validity of automated software for HVM image sequence analysis across broad populations, disease conditions and interventions.

It has offered a 24/7 Percutaneous coronary angiography (PCI) service to a geographically dispersed North Wales population of approximately 690,000 since June 2017. Prior to this, urgent coronary angiography was available on a more limited basis to patients requiring PCI. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with hospital mortality after critical care admission following cardiac arrest. Methods: Retrospective review of the Ward Watcher critical care database at GCH to identify patients who had undergone CPR in the 24 hours prior to critical care admission in 2013-18. Patients likely to have sustained OOHA of cardiac aetiology (OOHA-C) were identified from primary and secondary diagnoses and free text entry. Data were subsequently analysed using Excel and SPSS. The project was registered as a service evaluation with GCH Audit Department. Results: There were 190 cardiac arrest admissions over this period, increasing from 25 in 2013-14 to 69 in 2017-18. Of these 122 were OOHA, of which 103 were considered OOHA-C. Although OOHA-C hospital mortality appeared to decrease over the time period (89%% to 56%), this was not statistically significant (p=0.149). Factors associated with survival to hospital discharge are presented in the Tables below. On logistic regression, only PCI and low pH within the first 24 hours of critical care remained statistically significant (p=0.027 and p<0.001 respectively). Conclusions: Although we have been unable to make a distinction between patients presenting following STEMI and NSTEMI, and appreciating a potential influence of selection bias, the significant association between PCI and survival to hospital discharge supports the introduction of clinical pathways enabling PCI access following OOHA-C [1] . chest radiography.

Introduction: The UK Resuscitation Council has set out guidelines for management of patients post cardiac arrest [1] . This is in line with European Resuscitation Council guideline. We set out to find if we are following the guideline. Methods: We did a retrospective audit over the course of 2 years looking at the data of 24 patients who had in hospital and/or out of hospital cardiac arrest and after the return of spontaneous circulation were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We focused on whether the care they received was as per the standards set by the UK Resuscitation Council. Results: We had 11 in the hospital and 13 out of hospital cardiac arrests; 11 patients had less than 10 minutes of CPR, 9 had more than 10 minutes CPR and 4 patients the data was not recorded; 16 patients needed more than 61 minutes to reach from the site of arrest to the ICU. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide was >5.5 Kpa in 11 patients at two or more occasions. Target MAP was not documented in 9 patients; blood sugar target was not documented in 15 patients and was not maintained within limits in 5 patients. Target temperature was not documented in 10 patients. The withdrawal of treatment was not delayed for 72 hours in 1 patient out of 24. In 4 patients neurological tests were not documented. Multimodal assessment tools were not used in 1 patient. Electroencephalography and serum Neuron Specific Enolase were not used to diagnose brain deaths as they were not available at our trust. 11 patients were discharged, 12 died in the ICU and 1 died in hospital after discharge from ICU. Conclusions: The audit reflected our local practice and showed that our mortality was in line with the acceptable limits; poor documentation of plan of care which posed problems in analyzing the care that these patients received; some of the parameters were not being maintained as set by UK Resuscitation guideline. Introduction: High-quality chest compressions (CC) with minimized interruptions are one of the most essential prerequisites for an optimal outcome of resuscitation. Therapy of reversible causes of cardiac arrest often requires intra-hospital transportation (IHT) during ongoing CPR. The present study investigated CC quality during transportation depending on the position of the provider. Methods: 20 paramedics were enrolled into a manikin study with four groups: a reference group with the provider kneeling beside manikin on the floor (group 1), and 3 groups performing CC during a simulated IHT of 100 meters: walking next to the bed (group 2), kneeling beside the patient in bed (group 3, Fig. 1 ) or squatting above the patient in bed (group 4, Figure 2 ).

Stable CAD was found in 9 cases (14%) and a normal angiogram was found in only 9 cases (14%) (Figure 1 ). Conclusions: ACI was the leading precipitant of collapse. STsegment elevation was highly predictive of coronary occlusion. In addition, a culprit coronary lesion was identified in nearly 50% of patients undergoing CA despite the lack of STsegment elevation.

Introduction: Recent studies have shown that obesity and its related metabolic dysfunction exacerbates outcomes of ischemic brain injuries in some brain areas, such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex when subjected to transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI). However, the impact of obesity in the striatum after tGCI has not yet been addressed. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity on tGCI-induced neuronal damage and inflammation in the striatum and to examine the role of mTOR which is involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic and neurological diseases. Methods: Gerbils were fed with a normal diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then subjected to 5 min of tGCI.

Introduction: Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide derived from brown algae and possesses various beneficial activities, such as antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Previous studies have shown that fucoidan displays protective effect against ischemiareperfusion injury in some organs. However, few studies have been reported regarding the protective effect of fucoidan against cerebral ischemic injury and its related mechanisms. Methods: Therefore, in this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of fucoidan against cerebral ischemic injury, as well as underlying mechanisms using a gerbil model of transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) which shows loss of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) area. Fucoidan (25 and 50 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered once daily for 3 days before tGCI. Results: Pretreatment with 50 mg/kg of fucoidan, not 25 mg/kg fucoidan, attenuated tGCI-induced hyperactivity and protected CA1 pyramidal neurons from ischemic injury following tGCI. In addition, pretreatment with 50 mg/kg of fucoidan inhibited activations of resident astrocytes and microglia in the ischemic CA1 area. Furthermore, pretreatment with 50 mg/kg of fucoidan significantly reduced the increased 4-hydroxy-2-noneal and superoxide anion radical production in the ischemic CA1 area after tGCI and significantly increased expressions of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and SOD2 in the CA1 pyramidal neurons compared with the vehicle-treated-group.

Introduction: Basilar artery stroke has a multitude of different presentations and may not be captured on plain Computed Tomography (CT). It can progress to severe disability, locked in syndrome and death [1] . With the advent of thrombolytic and endovascular therapies, prompt diagnosis can change the outcome. We present a case of basilar artery stroke, which was heralded by tongue spasticity and dysarthria, indicative of pseudobulbar palsy. Methods: Case reviewed with consent. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Medline. Results: A 53-year-old presented with pulmonary oedema and hypertension. He was transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of a suspected anaphylaxis. His marked lingual swelling was associated with dysarthria. Glyceryl-trinitrate and labetalol infusions were started for hypertension. He developed left sided weakness and deteriorated over several days to the point that he could only move his right foot (Table 1) . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed midbrain ischaemia and angiogram showed no flow in the basilar artery (Fig 1,2) . Conclusions: Common presenting features of basilar artery occlusion include dysarthria, vertigo, vomiting, headache and motor defects; these may evolve gradually or be intermittent [1, 2] . Presentation with pseudobulbar palsy is described in early literature [2] . Delayed recognition of the stroke led to aggressive treatment of hypertension, potentially compromising perfusion to the penumbral area [2, 3] . This case highlights the need for a wide index of suspicion with posterior strokes. Consent: Informed consent to publish has been obtained from the patient prognosis is related to GCS < or = 8 on admission (P = 0.003) and to malignant cerebral edema (P = 0.004). Conclusions: Our study has shown some predictive factors closely related to mortality and morbidity in patients with acute ischemic stroke. GCS at admittance < or = 8 and onset of malignant cerebral edema lead to a worst prognosis at discharge from NICU.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 738, "end": 741, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1810, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1813, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1889, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2031, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2032, "end": 2034, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1492, "end": 1501, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1623, "text": "(Fig 1,2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "P213"}, {"text": "Coherence analysis of cerebral oxygenation using multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy evaluates cerebral perfusion in hemodynamic stroke TJ Kim 1 Table 1 ).

Introduction: Ischemic stroke patients experienced frequent early neurological deterioration (END) events. Since ischemic stroke has also been shown as inflammatory disease, the neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (NLR) may associated with END events. However, the direct study regarding this association has not been addressed. Poor grade SAH, use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, intracranial pressure monitoring, external ventricular drainage, blood transfusions and renal replacement therapy were all more frequent among nonsurvivors (all P<0.001). Mortality was also higher with initial lactate above 2 mmol/L, in those admitted to public hospitals and when admission to ICU was delayed more than 24 hours after ictus. After adjusting for common predictors (age, gender and WFNS) SAPS 3 non-Neuro, SOFA non-Neuro, early vasopressor use and admission to a public hospital were independently associated with hospital mortality. Moreover, the area under the curve for prediction of mortality with SAPS3, SOFA and WFNS was 0.86 ( Figure 1 ). Hospital, Austria. The association of intensity and duration of intracranial hypertension episodes with 12-month Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was visualized using the methodology introduced by G\u00fciza et al. [1] . Results: In both cohorts, it could be demonstrated that the combination of duration and intensity defined the tolerance to intracranial hypertension, and that a semi-exponential curve separated episodes associated with better outcomes from those associated with worse outcomes. The association with worse outcomes occurred at a lower pressure-time burden than what has been previously observed in patients with TBI. Nevertheless, the percentage of monitoring time spent by every patient in the zone associated with poor GOS was independently associated with worse 12-month neurological outcome, even after correcting for age and Fisher score ( Introduction: Apnea test is an essential component in the clinical determination of brain death, but it may incur a significant risk of complications such as hypotension, hypoxia and even cardiac arrest [1] .

Methods: Healthy male volunteers (n=15) were recruited. The participants had their postural sway assessed on a pressure sensitive board, and measurement of Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP). Ultrasounds were taken assessing thickness of the quadriceps and rectus abdominis. They performed 20 minutes of supine passive cycling, with FES supplying the lower limbs and abdomen.

Introduction: In most cases postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is transient, but still some patients suffer from persistent cognitive impairment which is associated with increased length of hospital stay, early withdrawal from labor market and higher mortality. Available data on the prevalence of POCD after cardiac surgery is very diverse from 20% to 90% upon discharge and up 20% 3 months after surgery. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of short-term and long-term POCD after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Methods: Psychometric testing was performed in 230 (mean age 63.5\u00b18.2) patients before, 10 days and 6 months after the surgery. We used following tests to assess cognitive capacity: auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), digit span test (DST), digit-letter substitution test (DLST), Stroop's test and trail making test (TMT). A decline in comparison to preoperative test results for 20% or more in two or more tests was declared as POCD. Results: The prevalence of POCD after 10 days was 31.7% (73 patients) and 9.1% (21 patients) after 6 months. When comparing patients who developed POCD with those who did not we found the former were older (69.2\u00b18.7 vs 61.1\u00b110.3 years; p<0.001), had lower education level (13.7\u00b12.1 vs 10.6\u00b1 2.4 years; p<0.05) and had longer surgery duration (250.4\u00b112.2 vs 232.1\u00b115.9 minutes; p<0.05). The most affected cognitive domains were long term memory (AVLT) and executive function (TMT) and least affectedworking memory (DST) and selective attention (Stroop's test). Conclusions: In our prospective study the prevalence of long-term POCD after cardiac surgery was slightly less (9.1%) in comparison to available data (from 9% to 20%). It might be due differences in psychometric testing and interpretation of its results among authors. Advanced age, low cognitive reserve and long duration surgeries are linked with higher incidences of POCD. Introduction: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common and widely described phenomenon in surgical patients. Advanced age, major surgery, certain general anesthetics, genetic factors, sleep deprivation and other factors were described as contributing factors to POCD. The hospital stay itself is a major 'social' trauma for patients; social isolation, sleep deprivation and changes in daily regimen may effect neurocognitive behavior of patients. In this trial we tried to assess the link between POCD and the length of hospital stay in cardiac surgery patients. Methods: 94 patients who underwent 'off-pump' coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery selected for this trial. Neuropsychological testing was performed prior to the operation and upon discharge. We used auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), digit span test (DST), digit-letter substitution test (DLST), Stroop test and trail making test (TMT). A 20% or more decline in two or more tests in comparison to preoperative test results was declared as POCD. Patients were allocated into two groups according to the length of hospital stay: the SHORT-STAY group (group 1) included patients (n=36) who were discharged on the 8th day after surgery or earlier and the LONG-STAY (group 2) group consisted of patients (n=58) who were discharged on the 9th day after surgery or later. Patients received similar anesthesia, postoperative care and were operated by the same surgical team. Reasons for prolonged duration of hospital stay were mainly surgical. Results: 11 patients (30.6%) in group 1 and 21 patients (36.2%) in group 2 had POCD upon discharge (p<0.05). Mean length of hospital stay were 7\u00b11.2 and 10\u00b11.4 days in group 1 and group 2 patients respectively (p<0.05). Conclusions: Prolonged length of hospital stay increased the prevalence of POCD in our trial. Studies with various types of surgical procedures and larger patient populations needed to further understand the effect of length of hospital stay to POCD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P230"}, {"text": "The influence of multiple trauma with head trauma on posttraumatic meningitis: a nation-wide study with hospital-based trauma registry in Japan Introduction: Posttraumatic meningitis is one of severe complications and results in increased mortality and longer hospital stay among head trauma patients. However, it remains unclear whether there is a difference in the incidence of post-traumatic meningitis due to single traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple trauma including head injury. Methods: This study was a retrospective observational study during 12 years We included trauma patients registered in Japanese Trauma Data Bank whose head AIS score was >3 in this study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess potential factors associated with posttraumatic meningitis such as CSF fistula, skull base fracture, type of injury that divided into single TBI and multiple trauma. Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine if regional cerebral oxygenation (rScO2) can be used as an indicator of tissue perfusion in ICU patients with TBI [1, 2] , and to determine the prognostic value of cerebral oxygenation rScO2 in survival prediction. Methods: Patients were enrolled retrospectively from January 2012 through July 2018 in the ICU of Derince Kocaeli Training Hospital. 250 patients with trauma patients and traumatic braine injury patients who were admitted to the ICU from the emergency room were included in the study. The sedation levels of the patients were followed up with BIS. The rScO2, BIS was taken as well as blood lactate level, mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output at baseline time, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Results: No significant difference was also detected between the value of rScO2 in all patients . It was Average ScO2 (right) 60.54 \u00b14.8 and Average rScO2 (left) 55.63\u00b1 5.4. Conclusions: Cerebral regional oxygen saturation might be helpful as one of the perfusion parameters in patients with TBI but it could have no prognostic value in mortality prediction. However, further studies with larger sample size are still needed to validate these results. Introduction: TBI in elderly is an increasingly cause of admission in ICU. Data regarding management and prognosis of these patients are lacking. Validated prognostic models refer to younger patients and do not adequately consider the influence of pre-injury functional status, which often compromises with aging. Frailty has been defined as a state age-related of increased vulnerability and decline in autonomy of daily life activity. Aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of frailty on outcome in TBI elderly patients. Methods: moderate and severe TBI patients >65years, admitted in NeuroICU from January 2017 to May 2018, were prospectively enrolled. Data of age, comorbidity, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupils' reactivity, CT scan characteristics, neurosurgical intervention and GOSE (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) at 6-months were collected.

Introduction: The Strong Ion Difference (SID) is essential for the assessment of acid-base equilibrium, thus requiring an accurate measurement of plasma electrolytes. Currently there is no gold standard for electrolyte measurements and SID computation. Differences in electrolyte values obtained with point-of-care (PoC) and central laboratory (Lab) analyzers have been reported [1, 2] . In previous studies [3, 4] we have shown that changes in PCO2 induce electrolyte shifts from red blood cells to plasma (and vice versa), yielding variations in SID. Aim of the present in-vitro study was to induce SID changes through acute changes in PCO2 and compare values of electrolytes and SID obtained with PoC and Lab techniques. Methods: Blood samples from 10 healthy volunteers were tonometered (Equilibrator, RNA Medical) with 3 gas mixtures at fractions of CO2 (FCO2) of 2, 12, and 20%. Electrolytes were measured quasisimultaneously with a PoC analyzer (ABL800 FLEX, Radiometer) and a routine Lab method (COBAS 8000 ISE, Roche). For both techniques a simplified SID was computed as sodium + potassiumchloride. Results: Bland-Altman analysis of SID calculated with PoC and Lab showed a proportional bias (slope = 0.64, r2 = 0.55, p <0.0001), indicating a variable agreement between methods according to the average SID value (Fig.1) . SID values measured with PoC and Lab at different FCO 2 differed significantly (p<0.001, Fig.2) . A similar discrepancy was observed for chloride (p <0.001, Fig.2 ), while sodium (p=0.439) and potassium (p=0.086) were similar. Conclusions: SID measured with PoC and Lab differed significantly, mainly due to a variable discrepancy in chloride. Our findings suggest that our POC analyzer is superior to the Lab in measuring electrolytes and thus compute SID.

The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Fig. 2) Introduction: The rate of extubation failure might be higher in obese patients than in non-obese patients. Effect of obesity on mortality is controversial [1, 2] (obesity paradox). Several pathophysiological changes contribute to an increase of respiratory complications [1] . We sought to identify incidence of extubation failure in obese and non-obese patients. Methods: The primary endpoint of this post-hoc analysis of a prospective, observational, multicenter study [3] performed in 26 intensive care units was extubation failure, defined as the need for reintubation within 48 hours following extubation. Only patients with body mass index (BMI) recorded were included. Results: Between December 1, 2013 and May 1, 2015, among the 1427 patients with BMI available undergoing extubation, 301 obese patients (21%) and 1126 non-obese patients (79%) were enrolled. Extubation-failure rate was 7.6% (23/301) in obese patients, and 11.0% (124/1126) in non-obese patients (p=0.09). Delay of reintubation did not differ between obese and nonobese patients (Figure 1 ). Length of intubation > 8 days was significantly more frequent in obese patients (84/301, 29%) than in non-obese patients (195/1126, 18%, p<0.0001). Precautions to anticipate extubation failure were more often taken in obese patients (153/301, 51%) than in non-obese patients (426/700, 38%, p<0.0001). Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) characteristics differed between obese and non-obese patients (Table 1) . Physiotherapy was more often used in obese patients (173/301, 57%) than in non-obese patients (556/1126, 49%, p=0.01). Conclusions: Incidence of extubation failure did not differ between obese and non-obese patients. In obese patients, clinicians anticipate more a possible extubation failure, delaying the moment of extubation, performing more physiotherapy and providing an optimal SBT. Introduction: In the acute phase of critical illness, growth hormone (GH) resistance develops, reflected by increased GH and decreased insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), mimicking fasting in health. The EPaNIC RCT observed fewer complications such as muscle weakness and faster recovery with accepting a macronutrient deficit in the first ICU week, as compared with early full feeding [1, 2] . We characterized its impact on the GH axis in relation to the risk of acquiring muscle weakness. Methods: In this EPaNIC RCT sub-analysis, for 564 matched patients per group, and all patients assessed for muscle weakness (n=600), serum GH, IGF-I, IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and IGFBP1 were measured upon ICU admission and at day 4 or the last ICU day for patients with shorter ICU stay (d4/LD). For 10 matched patients per group, GH was quantified every 10 min between 9 PM and 6 AM, and deconvolved to estimate GH secretion. Groups were compared with Wilcoxon test or repeated-measures ANOVA. Associations between changes from baseline to d4/LD and muscle weakness were assessed with logistic regression analysis, adjusted for baseline risk factors, baseline hormone concentrations and randomization. Results: In the fully fed group GH, IGF-I and IGFBP3 increased, whereas IGFBP1 decreased from admission to d4/LD (all p<0.001). Accepting an early macronutrient deficit prevented the rise in GH and IGF-I and the decrease in IGFBP1 (all p<0.005) but did not affect IGFBP3, whereas basal, but not pulsatile, GH secretion was lowered (p=0.005). A stronger rise in GH and IGF-I was independently associated with a lower risk of acquiring muscle weakness (OR (95%CI) per ng/ml change 0.88 (0.81-0.96) for GH; 0.98 (0.97-0.99) for IGF-I).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 941, "end": 944, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 945, "end": 947, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1060, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1260, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3039, "end": 3042, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3043, "end": 3045, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 114, "text": "2 (abstract P246)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 649, "end": 657, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 777, "end": 785, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1849, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2250, "end": 2259, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Reference"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Accepting an early macronutrient deficit suppressed basal GH secretion and reduced IGF-I bioavailability during critical illness, which may counteract its protection against muscle weakness. Introduction: Aim of the study was to relate hypokalemia (hypoK) and hypoglycemia as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment complications and precocious insulin interruption also use of sodium bicarbonate with length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Analysis of retrospective cohort study data of 100 patient (pt) treated for DKA at ICU of Hospital Kaunas Clinics of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences during 2012-2018 has been carried out. Serum kalemia, glycaemia; rate of episodes of hypoK, hypoglycaemia and precocious insulin interruption; use of sodium bicarbonate, in relation with LOS in ICU were analysed. SPSS 23.0 was used for statistic calculations. Traits evaluated as significant at p<0.05. Results: At the beginning of DKA treatment hypoK (3.1\u00b10.3 mmol/l) was recorded in 53/100 (53%) pt. Due to disregarding of blood pH (6.8 -7.3 (7.1 \u00b1 0.1) kalemia was falsely misinterpreted as \"normo-\" or \"hyperkalemia\" 3.5 -6.1 (4.8 \u00b1 0.8mmol/l) in 49 of 63 (78%) pt, as normo-and hyperkalemia thus not treated and complicated by hypoK additionally in 20/49 (41%) pt. In hypoK LOS in ICU was 52.2 \u00b1 31.3 vs 31.7 \u00b1 18.2 h, p<0.05. Insulin use has caused hypoglycaemia (1.2 -3.3 (2.5 \u00b1 0.7 mmol/l)) in 20/100 (20%) pt, LOS in ICU 62.1 \u00b1 40.3 vs 37.7 \u00b1 21.4 h, p<0.05. Insulin use was interrupted in case of normo -and hypoglycaemia with still persisting ketoacidosis in 34/ 100 (34%) pt, LOS in ICU was found to be 56.2 \u00b1 32.1 vs 35.5 \u00b1 22.5 h, p<0.05. Sodium bicarbonate was given for symptomatic treatment of acidosis during the first 10 h of DKA in 21/100 (21%) pt with stable hemodynamic: HCO3buffer has increased (4.2 \u00b1 3.1-7.5 \u00b1 3.0 mmol/l), p<0.05, but ketoacidosis has still persisted, LOS in ICU was 54.8 \u00b1 30.0 vs 39.3 \u00b1 26.5 h, p<0.05. Conclusions: HypoK (53%), hypoglycemia (21%), precocious interruption of insulin use (34%) have prolonged LOS in ICU almost twice. Symptomatic treatment of ketoacidosis with sodium bicarbonate (1/5 pt) didn't control it and has prolonged LOS in ICU. Introduction: Cystathionine-\u03b3 -lyase (CSE), a regulator of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced gluconeogenesis [1] , correlates with endogenous glucose production in septic shock [2] . The hyperglycemic stress response to noradrenaline (NoA) is mediated by the kidney [3] and less pronounced with low CSE [4] . GC receptor (GR)-mediated gene expression is differentially regulated: the GR monomer is considered to repress inflammation, and GC side effects are attributed to the GR dimer; recent reports challenge this view [5] . GC-induced gluconeogenic gene expression is reduced in GR dimerization deficient (GRdim) mice [6] . The aim of this study is to investigate renal CSE expression and systemic metabolism in GRdim and GRwt mice in a resuscitated model of LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Methods: Anesthetized GRdim (n=10) and GRwt (n=9) mice were surgically instrumented, monitored, resuscitated and challenged with LPS. NoA was administered to maintain MAP and 13 C 6 glucose was continuously infused. 6h after LPS, CSE expression was determined via immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin sections (n=8 p.gr.). Results: GRdim required 2.5-fold more NoA than GRwt and had 1.5fold higher glucose and 1.9-fold higher lactate 6h after LPS. This was concomitant with elevated endogenous glucose production (2-fold), 10% lower glucose oxidation and 1.8-fold higher renal CSE expression in GRdim.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2331, "end": 2334, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2402, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2491, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2525, "end": 2528, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2743, "end": 2746, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2846, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P247"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Increased CSE expression together with higher glucose production (confirming [2, 4] ) and glucose levels in GRdim mice suggest an association that may link CSE to GC signaling.

Introduction: To achieve safe glycemic control in critically ill patients frequent blood glucose (BG) measurements and according titration of insulin infusion rates are required. Automated systems can help to reduce increased workload associated with diabetes management. This bi-centric pilot study combined for the first time an intraarterial glucose sensor with a decision support system for insulin dosing (SGCplus system) in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia. Methods: Twenty-two patients (3 females, 19 males, 12 with preexisting diabetes mellitus, age 65.7 \u00b1 12.7 years, BMI 27.3 \u00b1 3.5 kg/ m2, creatinine level 1.4 \u00b1 1.2 mg/dl, SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) 64.6 \u00b1 18.3, TISS-28 (Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) 39.2 \u00b1 5.5 who were equipped with an arterial line and required iv insulin therapy were managed by the SGCplus system during their medical treatment at the intensive care unit. Results: 1845 SGCplus-based BG determinations were performed and 0.8 \u00b1 0.8 sensor calibrations per day were required. Sensor glucose readings correlated well with reference BG (Figure 1 ). Mean treatment duration was 6.0 \u00b1 3.8 days. Time to target was 100 \u00b1 178 min (80-150 mg/dl) and 135 \u00b1 267 min (100-160 mg/dl). Mean blood glucose was 142 \u00b1 32 mg/dl with seven blood glucose values <70mg/dl. Mean daily insulin dose was 62 \u00b1 38 U and mean daily carbohydrate intake 148 \u00b1 50 g /day (enteral nutrition) and 114 \u00b1 50 g/day (parenteral nutrition). Acceptance of SGCplus suggestions was high (>90%).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 93, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 94, "end": 96, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1370, "end": 1379, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "P247"}, {"text": "The novel intraarterial glucose sensor demonstrated to be highly accurate.

Introduction: We aimed to assess the effect of frailty as assessed by Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and Karnofsky performance score (KPS) on critical care (CC) and hospital mortality in this group at a nonspecialist tertiary critical care unit. Methods: Patients admitted to critical care were identified from our electronic database by screening for liver disease or cirrhosis in the admission diagnoses. Those with an aetiology of liver disease other than alcoholic liver disease (ALD) were excluded. Data was collected on patient demographics, length of stay, status at discharge from critical care and hospital and CFS. KPS was also calculated where sufficient in-formation was available in the medical record. Data was analysed using logistic regression multivariate analysis with Stata 14 software. [1] . Results: TG13 diagnosis criteria and severity grading criteria for acute cholangitis and acute cholecystitis were judged from numerous validation studies as useful indicators in clinical practice and adopted as TG18 diagnostic criteria and severity grading without any modification. Provide initial treatment, such as sufficient fluid replacement, electrolyte compensation, and intravenous administration of analgesics and full-dose antimicrobial agents, as soon as a diagnosis has been made. In new flowchart for the treatment of acute cholecystitis (AC) in the TG18, Grade III AC was indicated for gallbladder drainage, but some Grade III AC can be treated by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Lap-C) at advanced centers with specialized surgeons experienced in this procedure and for patients that satisfy certain strict criteria. We also redefine the management bundles for acute cholangitis and cholecystitis. Introduction: 13 C-acetate breath tests provide a non-invasive assessment of gastric emptying [1] and could, hence, be used to judge tolerance to enteral nutrition. Result values like t50 (time for 50% absorption) correlate with scintigraphic measurements. The data evaluation is based on model equations like the \u03b2 -exponential function (BEX) [1] . It considers a mono-phasic breath gas response. This may not be the case during critical illness, which could reduce precision too low for a reliable personalized assessment [2] . Methods: We recently developed an evaluation of irregular gastric emptying patterns, which separates absorption from post-absorptive distribution and retention of tracer and from the terminal respiratory release of the oxidized tracer [3] . Using breath test data of 31 ICU patients (mean SAPS2 36 +/-14) the precision of this approach was compared with a BEX analysis to explore how often an extended analysis is warranted and whether it improves the reliability of estimates. Results: 15 patients had a release profile consisting of series of peaks with a periodicity of 60-90 min. A first dominant peak carries about 95% of the released moiety, as reported [4] for controls. For these patients the precision in t50 for the BEX approach was 70 +/-30% of that observed for the new approach. For the other patients, the secondary peaks had a similar periodicity but were more pronounced, indicating persisting peristaltis, which has been linked to tolerance to enteral nutrition [4] . The BEX approach achieved a precision of 40 +/-27 % relative to the new one, challenging its applicability for these patients. Introduction: Clinical scoring systems used to prognosticate the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP), such as APACHE II, are cumbersome and usually require 24 hours or more after presentation to become accurate, at which time the window for early therapeutic intervention has likely passed. SIRS at presentation is sensitive but poorly specific for severe AP. We postulated that SIRS and accompanying hypoxemia would specify at presentation patients with AP who have severe inflammation and are at risk for clinically severe disease. Methods: Patients with AP who had SIRS and hypoxemia at presentation were enrolled in an open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CM4620-IE, a Calcium Release-Activated Calcium (CRAC) channel inhibitor (NCT03401190). Hypoxemia was defined as an estimated PaO2 <75 mm Hg calculated using a log-linear equation and the SpO2 on room air at the time of presentation. A contrastenhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed at presentation and a CBC with differential, D-dimer and CRP were analyzed daily. The CECT was read by a blinded central reader who assessed the degree of inflammation using the Balthazar scoring system (Table  1) . Results: 13 patients, seven men and six women, have been randomized in the study. The mean estimated PaO2 at presentation was 74 mm Hg. 10 patients had 2 SIRS criteria present and the other 3 patients had 3 SIRS criteria present. The median value for age was 53.5 (IQR 48-56), initial neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 10.6 (6. 3 Introduction: To investigate whether circulating immune profiles were able to serve as early biomarkers in predicting persistent organ failure (POF Methods: Thirty-nine patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis (pSAP) and 9 healthy control subjects were prospectively enrolled in our study. We measured the expression of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR), the proportions of dendritic cells (DC) and its subtypes (including myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)), the different cytokineproducing CD4+ T helper (Th) cells and regular T (Treg) cells. Plasma CRP and several inflammatory mediators levels were measured by ELISA. Results: Compared with healthy controls, there is a significant decrease in the expression of mHLA-DR, the frequencies of total circulating DCs and its subsets, and percentage of Th1 cells in patients with pSAP. However, we found significantly higher frequencies of Th17 cells, higher proportion of Treg cells than healthy subjects. Of interest, we observed that there was a significant decrease in the positive percentage and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of mHLA-DR, the proportions of total DCs and pDC, and Th1 cells in patients with POF compared with transient organ failure (TOF). Besides, there is a significantly higher frequency of Th17 cells in POF than those in TOF. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that disease severity scores had a moderate discriminative power for predicting POF in patients with pSAP. More importantly, the expression of mHLA-DR and the percentage of DCs and pDC had a significantly higher AUROC and thus, better predictive ability than disease severity in patients with pSAP. Conclusions: Circulating immune profile show multiple aberrations in patients with pSAP who have developed POF. Both the expression of mHLA-DR and the percentage of total DC and pDC may be early good biomarkers for predicting risk of POF in patients with pSAP. Introduction: Pancreatic fistula (POPF) due to anastomosis insufficiency is a common (12-30%) complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy and often discovered with delay, causing severe morbidity, ICU stay and deaths. Microdialysis (MD) catheters have been shown to detect inflammation and ischemia in several postoperative conditions and organs. The aim was to investigate if MD catheter monitoring could facilitate earlier detection of POPF than current standard of care. Methods: In a prospective, observational study 35 patients (44 to 88 years) were investigated. A MD catheter was fixed to the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. Samples for analysis of glucose, lactate, pyruvate and glycerol were acquired hourly during the first 24 hours, then every 2-4 hours to discharge. POPF was defined according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula 2016 update definition. Results: Patients who developed POPF (N=7) had significantly higher glycerol levels (P<0.01) in microdialysate than did patients without POPF (N=28) during the first 24 h. Thereafter, the difference diminished. A glycerol concentration >400 \u03bcmol/L during the first 12 h detected patients who later developed POPF with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 92%. Lactate and lactate to pyruvate ratio were significantly higher (P<0.05) and glucose was significantly lower (P<0.05) in patients with POPF from about 24 h. Fig. 1 shows microdialysis measurements in patients with (red lines) and without (blue lines) POPF. Conclusions: A high level of glycerol in microdialysate is an early (first 12 hours) indicator of POPF. Glucose, lactate and lactate to pyruvate ratio are indicators of peritonitis caused by the leakage. Thus, MD monitoring detects POPF several days earlier than current methods and may play an important clinical tool in the future. We are currently conducting a RCT to explore if MD monitoring will improve prognosis in these patients", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1001, "end": 1004, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2015, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2262, "end": 2265, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2445, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2683, "end": 2686, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3111, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3427, "end": 3430, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5075, "end": 5076, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4734, "end": 4744, "text": "(Table  1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 8474, "end": 8480, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "The phenomenon of total impaired of metabolic activity of gut microbiota in critically ill septic patients Introduction: During a critical condition, dramatic disturbances occur not only in the change of species diversity, but in gut microbiota metabolism as well, that might lead to nonreversible breakdowns of host homeostasis and death [1] .

BIVA is a commonly used approach for body composition measurements [1] . Muscular ultrasound represents a valid tool to provide qualitative and quantitative details about muscle disease [2] . Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to ICU and expected to require mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hours were enrolled in the study. Within the first 24 hours of ICU admission (T1), patients were evaluated with muscular ultrasonography comprehensive of diaphragm thickness (DTH) and rectus femoris cross-sectional area (CSA). At the same time, BIVA and biochemical analysis. All the same measures were repeated at day 3 (T3) and 7 (T7) (Figure 1 (Table 1) .

Conclusions: This study showed how the PA tends to be reduced in the first week of ICU stay. It is correlated with a concomitant Introduction: The modified Nutrition Risk in Critically ill (mNUTRIC) has been developed in order to identify critically ill patients who may receive benefit from nutrition support [1] . Several evidences showed the association between the mNUTRIC score and clinical outcomes [2, 3] , however there are no data in Thai critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to find the association between mNU-TRIC score and 28-day mortality in medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients, Ramathibodi hospital. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical patient records from June 2016 to January 2017. A mNUTRIC score of each patient was calculated to evaluate the risk of malnutrition. Statistical analysis of the association between mNUTRIC score and 28-day mortality, length of stay in ICU and hospital were performed. Results: A total of 78 critically ill patients were included in the study. The 28-day mortality was 53.06% in patients with high mNUTRIC score (5-9) and 13.79% in patients with low mNUTRIC score (0-4). Modified NUTRIC score was significantly correlated with 28 day mortality (r = 0.390, p<0.001), length of stay in ICU (r = 0.394, p<0.001) and length of stay in hospital(r = 0.414, p<0.001). In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the AUC of mNUTRIC score and 28-day mortality was 0.788 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.686-0.889) (Fig 1) . Optimal cut-off value of 6 showed sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 77.1% in mortality prediction (Youden's index, 0.438).

In present study, we consider that nursing staff may be able to use bedside ultrasound as an alternative to standard aspiration protocol or radiographic studies to assess gastric volume and nasogastric (NG) tube in patients with enteral feed intolerance. Methods: In present prospective, single-center study, we performed ultrasound residual stomach volume and NG tube placement assessments of adult critically ill patients (Figure 1 ) compared to standard protocol of stomach volume assessment (routine daily shift 60-ml syringe aspirations) and NG (nasogastric) tube placement verified by abdominal X ray. We used an abdominal (Linear Ultrasound Transducer) probe (4-10 MHz). The residual volume was calculated according to formula: GV (ml) = 27 +14.6 x right-lateral CSA-1.28 x age). Results: Hundred simultaneous double (ten critically ill patients) ultrasound measurements sessions were performed by nursing staff of our intensive care (ICU) (Fig 1) . Double simultaneous measurements of the ultrasound assessments were compared to standard nurse ICU protocol for assessment of residual volume of stomach. The new ultrasound assessment method demonstrated excellent intra-class reliability (ICC-0.96 (0.95-0.98, p<0.001) and strong correlation with standard residual volume assessment method (ICC-0.82 (0.7-0.89, p<0.001). NG tube placement was successfully verified by ultrasound measurements in all ten critically ill patients and, thereafter, confirmed by abdominal X-rays.

NG tubes are commonly indicated in level 2/3 patients, thus we set out to evaluate current practice in critical care. The aim was to evaluate: documentation of insertion, adherence to safety guidance pertaining to checking safe use, chest x-ray interpretation. Methods: This prospective cohort study was based on inpatients in critical care who had insertion of NG tubes over four weeks; there were 57 insertions. Data was analysed from patients' medical notes and the hospital's imaging system. Results: 65% of insertions were documented using proformas. 97.1% of proforma documentations included 4 or more details: type of tube, tube length at the nostril, NEX measurement, aspirate adequacy, chest x-ray adequacy, whether it was safe to feed. Only 13.6% of hand-written documentations included 4 or more details. 51% of initial aspirates were obtained on insertion, of these, 57% had an appropriate pH between 1 and 5.5. This led to 74% of patients having chest x-rays to confirm initial placement of the NG tube. Only 54% of chest x-rays adequately satisfied the four criteria. Written documentation in medical notes stating if it was safe to feed was completed in 67% of cases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 102, "end": 103, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P269"}, {"text": "Conclusions: We found that proformas ensure a higher level of detail and uniformity in the documentation of NG tube insertions. There was a high incidence of chest x-rays performed to confirm correct placement of tubes due to difficulties in obtaining aspirates and failure to follow guidelines. A need for a uniform, ward-specific proforma on NG tube insertion has been identified, as well as a teaching session on chest x-ray interpretation and on techniques to aid obtaining aspirates. We have established critical care's shortcomings in NG tube insertion documentation and tube safety checking. Introduction: Pressure ulcers(PU) are considered as important types of public health problems, due to high mortality and cost. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of curcumin and fish oil on prevention and treatment of PU using a feasible mice model. Methods: 28 mice were randomly divided into Control(Group 1), Curcumin(Group 2), Fish oil(Group 3), Curcumin and Fish oil(Group 4) groups. 5mm skin bridge between two 1000 gauss magnets was formed on the back of mice, followed by 3 ischemia reperfusion cycles as 12 hours of rest after 12 hours of magnet placement [1] . A single dose of curcumin and fish oil was injected intraperitoneally. Tissue samples had taken 10th day of first compression, rates of PU, inflammation, reepithelisation, neovascularisation and granulation were examined histopathologically. The data analyzed by Pearson chi-square test. Results: Third degree PU were observed in all groups.There was no significant difference between groups in terms of inflammation.The formation of reepithelisation showed a significant difference between groups.Partial reepithelisation ratios in group 3 and group 4 was elevated.There was significant difference between groups in terms of neovascularisation, the highest rate as 75% was observed in group 4.Formation of granulation was observed at maximum rate as 46.2% at group 3. Conclusions: Depending on positive results of curcumin, fish oil, cur-cumin+fish oil on wound healing it may be advised to use them in treatment of acute PU.After similar rate of PU with control group we consider that it should be beneficial to evaluate the effect of these therapies with more studies by changing the mode of administration, time of initiation and duration of therapy. Introduction: Inflammation is a key driver of malnutrition during acute illness and has different metabolic effects including insulin resistance and reduction of appetite. Whether inflammation influences the response to nutritional therapy in patients with disease-related malnutrition remains undefined. We examined whether the effect of nutritional support on the risk of mortality differs based on the inflammatory status of patients. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a multicentre trial in eight Swiss hospitals, where patients with a nutritional risk score (NRS) of \u22653 upon hospital admission were randomly assigned to receive protocol-guided individualized nutritional support according to nutrition guidelines (intervention group) or a control group. The inflammatory status was defined based on admission CRP levels as low inflammation (CPR <10 mg/dl), moderate inflammation (CRP 10-100 mg/dl) and high inflammation (CRP >100 mg/dl). Results: We included a total of 1,950 patients of which 27.33%, 45.85% and 26.82% had low, moderate and high inflammation levels on admission. While overall there was a significant reduction in 30day mortality associated with nutritional support (adjusted OR in the overall cohort 0.65, 95%CI 0.46 -0.91), the subgroup of patients with high inflammation did not show reduced mortality (adjusted OR 1.36, 95%CI 0.76 -2.41, p for interaction = 0.005). There was no difference in other secondary endpoints when stratified based on inflammation. Nutritional support did not affect CRP levels over time (kinetics). Conclusions: This secondary analysis of a multicentre randomized trial provides evidence, that the inflammatory status of patients influences their response to nutritional support. These findings may help to better individualize nutritional therapy based on patients initial presentation. Introduction: Low plasma glutamine levels have been associated with unfavourable outcomes in critically ill patients. This study aimed to measure plasma glutamine levels in critically ill patients and to correlate glutamine levels with biomarkers and severity of illness. Methods: We enrolled critically ill patients admitted to three ICUs in South Africa, excluding those receiving glutamine supplementation prior to admission. We collected clinical, biochemical and dietary data. Plasma glutamine levels were determined within 24 hours of admission, using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry and categorized as low (<420 \u03bcmol/L), normal (420-700 \u03bcmol/L) and high (>700 \u03bcmol/L). Results: Of the 330 patients (average age 47.42\u00b116.56 years, 56% male), 68% were mechanically ventilated, with a mean APACHE II score of 18.57\u00b18.55 and a mean SOFA score of 7.05\u00b13.78. Plasma glutamine levels were low in 58.5% (median plasma glutamine of 382.15 \u03bcmol/l). Baseline plasma glutamine correlated inversely with CRP (r=-0.287, p<0.001) and serum urea (r=-0.124, p<0.026), and positively with serum bilirubin (r=0.262, p<0.001) and serum ALT (r=0.119, p=0.032). Significantly more patients with low admission glutamine levels required mechanical ventilation (Chi2=12.65, p<0.001) and had higher APACHE scores (p=0.003), higher SOFA scores (p=0.003), higher CRP values (p<0.001), higher serum urea (p=0.008), higher serum creatinine (p=0.023), lower serum albumin (p<0.001) and lower bilirubin levels (p=0.054). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, APACHE score (odds ratio, [OR] 1.032, p=0.018), SOFA score (OR 1.077, p=0.016) and CRP (OR 1.006, p<0.001) were significant predictors of low plasma glutamine levels. ROC curve analysis revealed a CRP threshold value of 87.95mg/L to be indicative of low plasma glutamine levels (AUC 0.7, p<0.001). Conclusions: 58.5% of critically ill patients had low plasma glutamine levels on admission to ICU. This was associated with increased disease severity and higher CRP. Introduction: The East of England deanery Operational Delivery Network in the United Kingdom came together as a group of Intensive Care Units to comply an evidence-based care bundle. One of the branches of this care bundle is on parenteral nutrition and states: 'Parenteral nutrition should not be given to adequately nourished, critically ill patients in the first seven days of an ICU stay.' This is based on evidence [1] [2] [3] that showed that 'In patients who are adequately nourished prior to ICU admission, parental nutrition initiated within the first seven days has been associated with harm, or at best no benefit, in terms of survival and length of stay in ICU.\u00b4The objective of this second cycle was to assess whether or not we are adhering to the guidelines, last year we were failing to hit targets and after some action I reassessed how we performed in the year 2017 compared to 2016. Methods: A retrospective audit of the whole year of 2017 for all patients admitted to ICU who had parenteral nutrition started at any point during their stay. Results: There is a significant improvement in the percentage of patients who are being started incorrectly on TPN before 7 days (36% compared to 69%) (Fig 1, 2) . I also found a total reduction in the number of patients prescribed TPN, a reduction in the number of bags being used and a reduction in length of hospital stays. Conclusions: As we have recently switched over to an electronic ICU programme for all documentation and prescriptions, as part of our plan and act in the PDSA cycle we are organising for several things to be put in place on the new system on prescription: pharmacy authorisation, links to guidelines and alert/justification boxes. I will do a further cycle in another year. JG and MPC contributed equally. Introduction: Recent RCTs revealed clinical benefit of early macronutrient restriction in critical illness, which may be explained by enhanced autophagy, an evolutionary conserved process for intracellular damage elimination [1] . However, in the absence of specific and safe autophagy-activating drugs, enhancing autophagy through prolonged starvation may produce harmful side effects. A fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) may activate autophagy while avoiding harm of prolonged starvation, which also improved biomarkers of age-related diseases in an experimental study [2] . We evaluated if short-term interruption of continuous feeding can induce a metabolic fasting response in prolonged critically ill patients. Methods: In a randomized cross-over design, 70 prolonged critically ill patients receiving artificial feeding were randomized to be fasted for 12 hours, followed by 12 hours full enteral and/or parenteral feeding, or vice versa. Patients were included at day 8 in ICU and blood glucose was maintained in the normal range. At the start and after 12 and 24 hours, we quantified total bilirubin, urea, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH) in arterial blood. Insulin requirements were extracted from patient files. Changes over time were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA after square root transformation. Results: As compared to 12 hours of full feeding, 12 hours of fasting decreased bilirubin (-0.23\u00b10.06mg/dl; p=0.001) and IGF-I (-13.94 \u00b11.62ng/ml; p<0.0001), and increased BOH (+0.47\u00b10.07mmol/l; p<0.0001), without affecting urea concentrations (Fig 1) . Fasting reduced insulin requirements (-1.16\u00b10.14IU/hour; p<0.0001). Conclusions: Short-term fasting induces a metabolic fasting response in prolonged critically ill patients, which provides perspectives for the design of a FMD, aimed at activating autophagy and ultimately at improving outcome of critically ill patients. Introduction: Recent evidence has led to changed feeding guidelines for critically ill patients, with a shift towards lower feeding targets during the acute phase [1] . When micronutrients are not provided separately, prolonged hypocaloric feeding could induce micronutrient deficiencies and increase risk of refeeding syndrome once full feeding is restarted, which are both potentially lethal complications [2] . Since there is limited evidence how to optimize micronutrient provision in order to avoid deficiencies, we hypothesized that there is a great variation in current practice. Methods: Within the MEN section of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), we designed a questionnaire to gain insight in the current practice of micronutrient administration. In 3 email blasts, invitations were sent to all ESICM members, with currently more than 300 respondents. The survey will be closed at December 10, 2018. Results: First, we will describe demographic characteristics of the respondents, including geographical location, ICU and hospital type, and function. Second, we will describe some aspects of the current practice of micronutrient administration. We will identify the proportion of respondents having a protocol, on which evidence such protocol is based and whether it takes into account the stability and daylight sensitivity of micronutrients. Next, bearing refeeding syndrome in mind, we will identify whether there are respondents who never measure and/or separately administer micronutrients and phosphate. Finally, we will make a top 5 of the most measured and most supplemented micronutrients. Conclusions: This survey will deliver more insight in the current practice of micronutrient provision across different types of ICUs and may identify areas for future research. Furthermore, we will evaluate whether there is need to increase awareness for refeeding syndrome. Introduction: Large gastric residual volumes (GRVs) have been used as surrogate markers of delayed gastric motility to define enteral feeding intolerance (EFI). Recent studies have challenged the definition of EFI. Study objectives: 1) investigate the potential relationship between GRVs and clinically outcomes, 2) develop an algorithm for early identification of patients at increased risk of mortality due to EFI. Methods: A retrospective study of inpatient encounters from electronic health record charts within the Dascena Clinical Database. 4,018 patients were included in the study; 295 patients had EFI. Eight vital signs (diastolic/systolic BP, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, GRV, Glasgow Coma Scale, and feeding rate) and their trends were input to the classifier. Machine learning classifiers were created using the XGBoost gradient boosted tree method with 3-fold cross validation. Results: Rate of change in GRV (\u0394 GRV) was measured over a 5-day period, beginning at the time of EFI onset (Figure 1a) . Figure 1b shows a high likelihood of mortality for patients with none or modest GRV reduction. Patients with an increase in GRV over the five-day period after EFI onset had the highest mortality likelihood. A stratification algorithm was developed to identify EFI patients who died inhospital despite GRV reduction at 1, 12, and 24 hours in advance of EFI onset. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity of algorithm predictions of in-hospital death up to 24 hours in advance of EFI onset (Table 1) . Conclusions: The analysis suggests an association between GRV and mortality, especially in patients with persistent GRV increase over the 5-day period after EFI onset and the potential of algorithmic models to predict EFI development. Prospective validation of these Fig. 1 (abstract P274) . Changes in metabolic markers of fasting over time for both randomization groups algorithms may assist in clinical trial design to develop treatments for patients at highest risk of experiencing serious outcomes due to EFI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1168, "end": 1171, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6612, "end": 6615, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6616, "end": 6619, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6620, "end": 6623, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8210, "end": 8213, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8551, "end": 8554, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10071, "end": 10074, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10316, "end": 10319, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 7403, "end": 7413, "text": "(Fig 1, 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 9576, "end": 9583, "text": "(Fig 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 12830, "end": 12841, "text": "(Figure 1a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 12844, "end": 12853, "text": "Figure 1b", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 13402, "end": 13411, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 13681, "end": 13703, "text": "Fig. 1 (abstract P274)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Fig. 1 (abstract P268).

In the present project, quality improvement methodology was utilised with the aim of delivering greater calories by implementing 24-hour volume-based feeding and allowing increased feeding rates for, 'catch up' of missed daily feed volume. Methods: Baseline data assessing the percentage of daily kCal delivered to ventilated patients was collected in September 2017. Data was presented and new intervention guidelines agreed based upon the PEPuP protocol [2] . Nurse champions were identified and were responsible for cascade training of the PEPuP protocol. Educational tools to help determine daily calorific requirement and volume of feed required were provided. Repeat data was collected at 6 months (cycle 2) after PEPuP implementation. Results: Ten patients were included in cycle 1. During cycle 1 the percentage of kCal achieved via enteral feeding was 45%. Following intervention this increased to 82% (p<0.001) during cycle 2. This increased further to 95.3% of daily kCal when calories obtained from Propofol were included. Conclusions: A 24-hour volume-based feeding regimen is a simple and cost-effective method of improving enteral feeding targets. Through the use of quality improvement methodology, we demonstrated that this approach is achievable.

While effective calory needs can be measured or calculated, the needs of proteins are more controversial. We aimed to calculate non-nutritional calories and assess how they influence the ratio of calories to protein delivered to the patients. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, nutritional and nonnutritional calories and protein delivery were calculated in 220 consecutive ICU patients receiving enteral nutrition in 2016. Introduction: Marked protein catabolism is common in neurocritical patients. Optimal nutritional monitoring and protein nutritional adequacy could be associated with outcome in neurointensive care unit (NCU) patients. We aimed to evaluate the impact of monitoring and optimal support of protein using nitrogen balance on outcome in neurocritical patients. Methods: A consecutive 69 patients who were admitted to NCU were included between July 2017 and February 2018. Nitrogen balance was calculated using excreted urine urea nitrogen during ICU admission. Follow-up nitrogen balance monitoring was performed in 33 patients. We divided patients into two groups based on the results of nitrogen balance (positive balance and negative balance). Moreover, we evaluated improvement of nitrogen balance in 33 patients. We assessed the outcome as length of stay in hospital, length of stay in NCU, and in-hospital mortality. We compared the clinical characteristics and outcome according to nitrogen balance. Results: Among the included patients (age, 58.1; and male. 59.4%), 53 (76.8%) patients had negative nitrogen balance. The negative balance group was more likely to have lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), longer length of stay in hospital, and longer length of stay in NCU. In 33 patients with follow-up nitrogen balance monitoring, improvement of nitrogen balance group had lower in-hospital mortality (10.5% vs. 50.0%, P = 0.019), and received adequate protein intake (1.8 g/Kg/day vs. 1.1 g/Kg/day, P = 0.001) compared to no change group (Table 1) . There was no significant difference in baseline nitrogen balance, baseline body mass index, and GCS between two groups. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that critical illness patients in NCU are underfeeding using nitrogen balance, however, adequate provision of protein was associated improvement of nitrogen balance and outcome.

Logistic regression analysis was used to determine correlation between protein delivered (which was proportional to the concentration of protein in the formula utilized) and clinical outcomes. Results: 2000 medical encounters for a total number of 12,321 ICU days were collected and analyzed. Average age was 62.2 years (55.2% male) and 68.1% were obese and overweight. Primary diagnoses included sepsis or septic shock, acute and/or chronic respiratory failure (or illness), cardiovascular diseases, stroke and cerebrovascular diseases among others. Median hospital LOS was 13.6 days, 6.9 days in the ICU, median days of invasive mechanical ventilation of 4. 30-day readmission rate among patients discharged alive was 19.3%.

Conclusions: A significant improvement in mortality is observed with increased protein delivery while decreasing carbohydrate loads. Prospective randomized trials are warranted to establish causality. Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high mortality. The risk increases with severity of AKI. Our aim was to identify risk factors for development and subsequent progression of AKI in critically ill patients. Methods: We analysed 2525 patients without end-stage renal disease who were admitted to the ICU in a tertiary care centre between January 2014 to December 2016 and did not have AKI on admission.

The effect of the duration of cooling on AKI has not been well studied. In this post-hoc analysis of the TTH48 randomized controlled trial that compared 24 vs 48-hours of TTM (33\u00b0C) after cardiac arrest [2] , we studied the impact of TTM length on the development of AKI. Fig. 1 . Duration of TTM had a significant impact on the development of creatinine values during the first 7 days in the ICU, p<0.05. This was primarily driven by an increase in creatinine during rewarming on day 2 for the 24hour and day 3 for the 48-hour group (Fig 2) .

Those who survived for >12 months were included. Demographics, baseline serum creatinine, presence of AKI during ICU admission, and serum creatinine at hospital discharge were determined. Serum creatinine and dependence on renal replacement therapy (RRT) were assessed at 6 and 12 months post ECMO. Results: 13 patients had a complete (or near-complete) data-set available. The mean age was 45.5 years, 38% of whom were male. 8/13 had AKI during their critical care admission. None were dependent on RRT at 6 or 12 months post ECMO. Most patients had lower serum creatinine results at hospital discharge compared to their pre-hospitalisation baseline, but creatinine concentrations at 6 and 12 months post ECMO tended to be higher than at hospital discharge ( Figure 1) . Conclusions: In this cohort of ECMO patients who were discharged from hospital alive, serum creatinine tended to be lower at hospital discharge compared to baseline and rose again in the following 12 months.

Introduction: Emergency Department (ED) crowding is a major public health concern. It delays treatment and possible ICU admission, which can negatively affect patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ED to ICU time (ED-ICU time) is associated with ICU and hospital mortality. Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study using data from the Dutch NICE registry. Adult patients admitted to the ICU directly from the ED in 6 academic centers, between 2009 and 2016, were eligible for inclusion. For these patients NICE data were retrospectively extended with ED admission date and time. ED-ICU time was divided in quintiles. The data were analyzed using a logistic regression model. We estimated crude and adjusted (for disease severity; Apache IV probability) odds ratios of mortality for ED-ICU time.

Introduction: Generally, prehospital medical provider should minimize staying prehospital scene to reach the patient to definitive care as soon as possible in prehospital medical activity.

Introduction: REBOA is an endovascular intervention intended to preserve central perfusion in the context of shock due to noncompressible torso haemorrhage. More so, it is less invasive than the traditional approach of resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) and aortic crossclamping. Though its use dates back to the Korean War, it has not been widely adopted in trauma management, as evidence demonstrating clear benefit compared with conventional RT is lacking [1] . We aimed to evaluate feasibility, outcomes and complications after REBOA for haemorrhagic shock and traumatic cardiac arrest. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review, searching SCOPUS and PUBMED databases using relevant terms (July 2018). We included studies enrolling patients with haemorrhagic shock or cardiac arrest after civilian trauma who had undergone REBOA and reported hospital mortality (our primary outcome).

Introduction: We describe the changes in anti factor Xa (aFXa) activity, thrombin generation and thromboelastography (TEG) in critically ill patients with and without acute kidney injury (AKI) following routine administration of Tinzaparin as part of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. Methods: Pilot prospective observational study. 18 patients divided into those with and without AKI were administered Tinzaparin by subcutaneous injection as per established local guidelines. 6 patients who did not receive Tinzaparin were recruited as a 'control'. Plasma aFXa activity and thrombin generation were measured at intervals over a 24 hour period. TEG parameters were collected at t0 and t24. Results: aFXa activity: Results are shown in Figure 1 . 3/18 patients failed to achieve a prophylactic aFXa level of >0.2 at any point. 14/18 patients achieved a level of >0.2 however in all cases this was at the lower end of the prophylactic range and was achieved for only a short time (median 1.5 hours). 1/18 achieved a level of >0.2 for the whole 24h period. There was no difference between the AKI and no AKI groups. Endogenous thrombin generation: there is no significant difference in thrombin generation between the AKI and no AKI groups. There is a significant decrease in thrombin generation between 0h and 5h (p<0.01) and a significant increase between 5h and 24h (p<0.01) (Figure 2 ). There is no significant difference between 0h and 24h (p=0.90). TEG: all TEG parameters for all patients were within normal range Conclusions: Standard VTE prophylactic dose Tinzaparin rarely achieves an aFXa range that has been suggested for VTE prophylaxis. However, as assessed by thrombin generation, a hypo-coagulable state is generated in response to LMWH. There is no difference between critically ill patients with or without AKI that would suggest the need for dose reduction in this context. 2 (abstract P334) .

Current data demonstrates the importance of researching of changes in haemostatic system in paediatric patiens after CPB. Provided below data is an intermediate result of our research. Methods: 39 patients in age up to 11 mohth 29 days (median age -5,5 months, youngest age -2 days after birth, oldest -11 months 29 days), who underwent cardiac surgery with CPB to treat congenital heart diseases, were enrolled in this study. All patients were divided into two groups: 1stwithout TC, 2ndwith TC. Protein C (PC) and fibrin-monomer (FM) plasma levels were assessed in there points: before surgery, 24-hours and 72 hours after surgery. Thrombotic cases were provided by Doppler ultrasound or MRI. Results: Thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 7 chidren (18%). Between all TC ischemic strokes were diagnosed in 57% (4 cases), arterial thrombosis in 29% (2 cases), intracardiac thrombus in 14 % (1 cases). In group with TC FM-mean values in points 1,2 and 3 respectively were 9.62; 37 and 108 mcg/ml, meamwhile in group without thrombosis -7.5; 36.04 and 9.25 mcg/ml .PC-mean value in 1st groupwere 50; 56 and 76%, in the 2nd group -49; 52 and 39% respectively in the points 1, 2 and 3. Statistically significant differences between groups in 3rd point (p<0.05) and correlation between PC and FM (r=-0.93; p<0.05) were detected. Conclusions: CPB causes hypercoagulation with increasing of PC consumtion and FM level. Moreover, CP associated with a high risk of TC on the 3rd day after cardiac surgery. Further studies to investigate prognostic values of FM and PC in thrombosis are required. These studies would help to asses FM and PC as markers of TC and possibility of PC-prescribing for prevention and treatment of these complications.

In patients with DIC, their DIC scores tended to be 'positive' for the first 4 days of admission. Fibrin-related markers were often not available for DIC scoring. Mortality rates amongst patients with sepsis-associated DIC were greater than patients with non-sepsis related DIC. Thrombocytopenia severity was associated with mortality, and patients with platelets above the upper limit of normal had lower mortality rates (11% when platelets > 400x10^9/L, 30% when platelets <50x10^9/L). Conclusions: Sepsis-associated coagulopathy is associated with a higher mortality rate than non-sepsis associated coagulopathy. Supranormal platelet counts may be associated with a mortality benefit. Introduction: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a major problem in ICU and affects overall lethality. DVT is widespread complication in ICU, especially in elderly patients, when early activisation may not be achieved. Aim of this study is comparison of haemostatic potential and analgesia methods of elderly patients who underwent major urological surgery during their stay in ICU. Methods: A cross-sectional study was employed. Participants were \u226570 y.o., underwent major urological surgery, have had normal initial hemocoagulation data (thromboelastography was performed to all of them), had received analgesia with epidural catheter or IV by opioids use and were treated in ICU >3 days due to non-coagulopathy states, were included. Data were collected from October 2017 till October 2018. The patients were examined with thromboelastograph \"Mednord\" for thromboelastogramm (TEG) and with eSaote USG for thrombi occurrence in lower limb deep veins. The anticoagulants were prescribed under the ESA guidelines 2017. Results: Participants (n=30) were divided in two groups -non-opioid analgesia with epidural catheter (n=12) and opioid analgesia (n=18). We received moderate decrease in anticoagulants dosage to the patients with epidural analgesia with the same TEG goals compared to the patients with opioid analgesia. Other factors as comorbidities may provoke DVT events, but was not evaluated in this study. The DVT events were monitored by expert with the use of USG to locate thrombi in the vein. Conclusions: Use of epidural catheter analgesia provides moderate decrease of anticoagulants dosage compared to opioid analgesia patients; however strict control of TEG data must be presented. Comorbidity need to be monitored for early detection and prevention of DVT events. Introduction: Patients with morbid obesity (MO) have a high risk of thromboembolic events. In patients with a BMI >35, the hypercoagulable state is due to impairment of all parts of the blood coagulation as well as anticoagulation mechanisms by obesity. Methods: The hemostasis system was studied in 100 patients with a BMI> 35 kg/m2 with various pathologies that were admitted to ICU. All patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the type of therapy: 1 group (n=50) received monotherapy with Enoxaparin sodium 0.1% 0.2 ml SC 2 times a day every 12 h; group 2 (n=50) received combination therapy with Enoxaparin sodium 0.1% 0.2 ml SC 2 times a day every 12 h and Pentoxifylline 100 mg 2 times a day every 12 h. To study the hemostasis system, we used LPTEG immediately after hospitalization, on 1, 3, 5 days. Results: In both groups, prior to treatment: Contact Coagulation Intensity (ICC) was increased by 23.57%, Intensity of coagulation drive (ICD) -by more than 32.68%, clot maximum density (MA) -by 74.52%, index of retraction and clot lysis (IRCL) -91.18% above normal. Patients of the 1st group: ICC increased by 12.62%, ICD was close to normal values, MA increased by 18.63%, IRCL was increased by 31.17%. Patients of the 2nd group on the 5th day: ICC decreased by 15.22% compared with the norm; the coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters were close to normal values and the decrease in fibrinolysis activity reaches to normal. Conclusions: Combined therapy of thromboembolic complications in patients with obesity Sodium Enoxaparin sodium and Pentoxifylline is more effective than Enoxaparin sodium monotherapy because it affects all parts of the hemostatic system. Introduction: A laryngeal injury secondary to blunt neck trauma can lead to life-threatening upper airway obstruction [1, 2] . Ultrasound enables us to identify important sonoanatomy of the upper airway [3] . The purpose of this report is to discuss role of POCUS airway in blunt neck trauma and to determine airway management based on standard Schaefer 5 subgroups classification. Methods: Three cases of blunt neck trauma presented to our centre with either subtle or significant clinical signs and symptoms. Standard airway management was performed prior to POCUS airway using 15MHz linear transducer and it findings were later compared to flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy and Computed Tomography (CT). Results: POCUS airway had identified one out of 3 cases to have Schaefer 2 and the remaining as Schaefer 3. All POCUS airway findings were confirmed with flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy and CT scan (Figs 1, 2) . Based on Schaefer, supportive care and early steroid administration are advisable for group 1 and 2. For groups 3 to 5, immediate open surgical repair is deemed necessary due to extension of injuries.All cases were intubated using Glidescope.All including those presented with Schaefer 3 were managed conservatively and discharge well with proper follow-up. Conclusions: Upper airway ultrasound is a valuable, non-invasive and portable for evaluation of airway management even in anatomy distorted by pathology or trauma. An organised approach using POCUS airway as an adjunct can expedite care and prevent early and long term complications in facilities without flexible laryngoscope and CT. Introduction: High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and helmet noninvasive ventilation (hNIV) are increasingly used for the early management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). We compared the physiological effects of HFNO and hNIV during AHRF. Methods: In this randomized cross-over study, we enrolled patients with acute-onset (<7 days), non-cardiogenic respiratory distress (respiratory rate>25/min), pulmonary infiltrates at the chest-x-ray and hypoxemia (SpO2<90% while breathing on room air). All patients received hNIV (PEEP 10 cmH2O, pressure support adjusted to achieve a peak inspiratory flow of 100 L/min) and HFNO (flow 50 L/min) for one hour each, in a randomized cross-over manner. At the end of each period, arterial blood gases, inspiratory effort (esophageal pressure) and respiratory rate were recorded. Self-assessment of dyspnea and device-related discomfort ( [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ). Conclusions: As compared to HFNO among critically ill patients with AHRF, hNIV ameliorates oxygenation, limits inspiratory effort and relieves dyspnea, without affecting PaCO2, respiratory rate and comfort. Introduction: Pre-intubation hypoxemia is a predictor of negative patient outcomes including in-hospital mortality. While successful first intubation attempt is also an important factor of patient outcomes, little is known about whether physicians achieve successful first intubation attempt for the hypoxemic patients in the emergency department (ED). The aim of this study is to investigate the first-pass success for patients with pre-intubation hypoxemia in the ED. Methods: This is an analysis of the data from the second Japanese Emergency Airway Network study (JEAN-2 study)a multicenter, prospective, observational study of 15 EDs in Japan. We included all patients who underwent intubation in the ED from 2012 through 2018. We excluded patients 1) aged <18 years and 2) patients who underwent intubation for cardiac arrest. We grouped pre-intubation hypoxemia as follows: non-hypoxemia (oxygen saturation [SpO2], \u226597%), moderate-hypoxemia (SpO2, 96%-90%), and severehypoxemia (SpO2, <90%). Primary outcome was the first-pass success rate. To demonstrate the association between pre-intubation hypoxemia and the first-pass success in the real-world setting, we fit two unadjusted logistic regression models 1) using grouped preintubation hypoxemia as a categorical variable and 2) using the preintubation SpO2 as a continuous variable. Results: Among 10,144 patients who underwent intubation in the ED (capture rate, 97%), 5,463 patients were eligible for the analysis. Compared to the non-hypoxemia, the first-pass success rate was low in moderate-hypoxemia (72% vs 67%; OR=0.77 [95%CI, 0.67-0.89]) and severe-hypoxemia (72% vs 69%, OR=0.85 [95%CI, 0.72-0.99]). Additionally, there was a linear association between pre-SpO2 and lower first-pass success rate (OR for the success, per one pre-SpO2 decrease, 0.99 [95%CI, 0.98-0.99]). Conclusions: Based on the large, multicenter data, the first-pass success rate was low in hypoxemic patients compared to nonhypoxemic patients in the ED.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4868, "end": 4871, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4872, "end": 4874, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4953, "end": 4956, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7244, "end": 7245, "text": "(", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7246, "end": 7249, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7250, "end": 7253, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7254, "end": 7257, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7258, "end": 7261, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7262, "end": 7265, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 5655, "end": 5666, "text": "(Figs 1, 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "P331"}, {"text": "Introduction of rapid-sequence induction guideline to reduce drug-associated hypotension in critically unwell patients Introduction: The aim of this project was to assess whether the introduction of a Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) agent guideline changed drug choice and the incidence of peri-intubation vasopressor use at St John's Hospital, Livingston. It is well documented that emergency airway management in the critically ill can be a source of significant morbidity and mortality [1, 2] and the choice of induction agent matters [3] . Methods: An RSI agent guideline was instituted for all critically ill patients being intubated in ICU and the ED [ Figure 1 ]. Following this, we set up an intubation registry to collect data from all intubation events. This data was then compared to a previous audit of intubations completed in 2012. Results: The choice of agent used pre-and post-intervention are summarized in Figure 2 . Forty-five intubation events were included in the initial audit in 2012, of which, 7 (16%) required vasopressor support immediately following intubation. Of the 41 intubation events following the guideline's introduction, 2 (5%) required vasopressors. Ketamine use changed from 0% to 51%, Propofol use from 43% to 29% and Midazolam from 14% to 0%. Thirty-eight of these intubation events (93%) were compliant with the guideline. Conclusions: The introduction of the RSI guideline dramatically affected the choice of induction agent and reduced the incidence of significant hypotension requiring vasopressors (5% versus 16%). Overall compliance with the guideline was excellent (93%). Introduction: The purpose is to test the feasibility of using the I-Gel\u00ae device for airway maintenance during bronchoscopic-guided percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT). Usually PDT is accomplished via the tracheal tube. Failure to position the endotracheal tube correctly can result in further complications during the procedure. The alternative implies extubation and reinsertion of an I-Gel\u00ae airway device. Methods: The PDT was performed using the Blue Dolphin method in 5 patients in intensive care unit. Before undertaking bronchoscopicguided percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT), the patient's tracheal tube (ET) was exchanged for I-Gel\u00ae, as a ventilatory device for airway maintenance. The insertion of the I-Gel\u00ae, the quality of ventilation, the blood gas values, the view of the tracheal puncture site, and the view of the balloon dilatation were rated as follows: very good (1), good (2), barely acceptable (3), poor (4), and very poor (5) [1] . Results: The I-Gel\u00ae successfully maintained the airway and allowed adequate ventilation during percutaneous tracheostomy in all patients. The ratings were 1 or 2 in 100% of cases with regards to ventilation and to blood gas analysis, for identification of relevant structures and tracheal puncture site, and for the view inside the trachea during PDT. Conclusions: The I-Gel\u00ae successfully maintained the airway and allowed adequate ventilation during percutaneous tracheostomy in all patients. The ratings were 1 or 2 in 100% of cases with regards to ventilation and to blood gas analysis, for identification of relevant structures and tracheal puncture site, and for the view inside the trachea during PDT. No damages to the bronchoscope, reports of gastric aspiration or technical problems were detected. The bronchoscopic view obtained via an I-Gel\u00ae seems to be better than that obtained through an endotracheal tube (ET) or through traditional laryngeal mask [1] . Introduction: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficiency of nasal airway inserted in the oral airway (ON airway) in securing the airway patency during mask ventilation [1] (Fig 1) . Methods: Fifty eight patients undergoing general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either oral airway group (group O) or ON airway group (group N). In both group, 2 mg/kg of propofol was infused intravenously and mask ventilation was performed in the sniffing position without head extension or jaw thrust. The patients were ventilated with a volume-controlled ventilator with O2 flow of 10 l/min, tidal volume of 10 ml/kg (IBW), and respiratory rate of 10 /min. Before the start of mask ventilation, airway was placed in the oral cavity. Oral airway was used in group O and ON airway was used in group N. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), tidal volume and EtCO2 were compared between the two groups. The location of airway tip was graded by fiberoptic bronchoscope as; 0: airway obstructed by tongue, 1: epiglottis visible, 2: airway touches epiglottis tip, 3: airway passes beyond epiglottis tip [2] . Methods: A prospective uncontrolled observational study in 2017-18 in 4 Ukrainian hospitals. 10 SMA-pts from 6-18 mo were involved. All pts. ready for extubation: afebrile, no infiltrations on chest x-ray, normal WBC. However, each SMA-pts. failed SBT (T-tube or PSV). We evaluated: extubation success (no reintubation in 48 hours), ICU LOS, one year survival. Three pts. were excluded: two pts. by staff decision, 1 family have choosen tracheostomy. 7 SMA-pts. included. A cuff leakage test performed -with a negative, dexamethazone 1mg IV was administered. After extubation NIV was started by Ventilogik LS in ST mode via nasal mask Giraffe. The EPAP and IPAP settings were titrated to reach the chest excursion and target levels of SpO2 (92-96%) and EtCO2 (40-45 mmHg). A sputum was draining by mechanical insufflation-excuflation (MIE) and aspirator Results: All pts, were extubated successful. The mean ICU LOS was 8.5 days (7-10 days), one year survival rate was 100%, respiratory failure fully compensated by NIV, there was no ICU admission. Every SMA-pts. are in good condition, gaining weight Introduction: Aerosol delivery has previously been assessed during simulated adult HFNT, delivered by various stand-alone humidification systems [1] . The objective of this study was to evaluate aerosol delivery during simulated HFNT delivered by a mechanical ventilator, across three clinically relevant gas flow rates. Methods: 2ml of 2 mg/ml salbutamol was nebulised using an Aerogen Solo nebuliser (Aerogen, Ireland). An adult head model was connected to a breathing simulator (ASL5000, Ingmar, US), Vt 500 ml, BPM 15 and I: E, 1:1 (Fig 1) . HFNT was supplied via the Servo-U ventilator (Maquet, Getinge, Sweden), using the integrated nebulisation option. Tracheal dose was recorded at two nebuliser positions; A (after the humidification chamber) or B (before of the cannula), at three gas flow rates (10LPM, 30LPM and 60LPM) (n=3). The mass of drug captured on a filter placed distal to the trachea (tracheal dose) was quantified using UV spectroscopy at 276 nm.

At 60LPM, a greater tracheal dose was yielded when the nebuliser was positioned after the humidifier (p= <0.0001). Introduction: Tracheotomies are often performed in critically ill patients who are in need of prolonged mechanical ventilation and respiratory care. Our aim was to evaluate the possible effect of percutaneous and surgical tracheotomies on thyroid hormone levels. Methods: Eighty seven adult patients were included in our study from January 2017 to September 2018. Patients were in need of prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheotomies were performed after consent was taken. We have excluded patients with preexisting thyroid diseases. Forty five patients were undergone percutaneous tracheotomies and forty two patients were undergone for surgical. Thirty eight female patients and forty nine male, age range 18-85. We studied TSH, T3 and FT4 serum levels using Chemiluminescence Immunoassay method before either procedure and 2 hours post each procedure.: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15. Significance was estimated at the level of p< 0.005 Results: TSH levels were increased in surgical group compared to percutaneous group at 2 hours post procedure but the difference was not found statistically significant (p> 0.005). The rise in post operative levels of T3 compared to preoperative was found statistically significant for surgical tracheotomy group (p< 0.005).Elevated FT4 levels for both groups have shown statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative period for the surgical tracheotomy group (p< 0.005) Conclusions: We analyzed the effect of surgical versus percutaneous tracheotomy on thyroid hormones and it was found that both Introduction: Insertion of a tracheostomy for weaning purposes is associated with prolonged critical length of stay (LOS) and several adverse patient outcomes [1] . Previous work has suggested that protocolised weaning may reduce weaning times [2] . We aimed to assess the impact of protocolised weaning on LOS following introduction of a standardised weaning protocol in 2017. Conclusions: Introduction of a standardised weaning protocol for patients with a tracheostomy in our unit has had a beneficial effect on several patient outcomes, notably duration of weaning and length of critical care admission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2244, "end": 2247, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2332, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P343"}, {"text": "Introduction: Delirium is a relatively frequent neurologic complication in liver transplantation (LT) recipients, which is an important cause of increased morbidity, mortality, extended ICU stay, and increased cost of medical care.

Ventilatory inefficiency (VI) is best assessed by the Bohr-Enghoff physiological dead space [2] . We recently reported that the minute ventilation to CO2 production ratio (VE/VCO2), a simplified VI index from exercise testing that obviates the PaCO2 measurement, correlates better than other VI indices to physiological dead space in mechanically ventilated patients [3] . Here we report the prognostic performance of this index using a survival analysis. Mean\u00b1SEM VE/VCO2 was higher in patients who died than those who survived (58\u00b18 vs 43\u00b11, p<0.001, Figure 1 ). We found a VE/ VCO2 cutoff value of 45. Mortality was higher in patients with High-VE/VCO2 (\u226545) as compared to those with Low-VE/VCO2 (21% vs 4%, p=0.021) with an Odds ratio of 6.7 [95%-CI 1.2-35.8]. Cumulative mortality was higher in the High-VE/VCO2 than in the Low-VE/VCO2 group (Log-rank p=0.015, Figure 2 ). Conclusions: In this unselected cohort of mechanically ventilated patients an early high VE/VCO2 ratio was associated to 28-days mortality. The VE/VCO2 ratio may be a simple and non-invasive VI index with prognostic value in this population. Introduction: Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is a clinically relevant and safe hydrogen sulfide donor that improved acute lung injury (ALI) and brain ischemia/reperfusion injury in previous studies [1, 2] . Methods: In a prospective, controlled, randomized, and doubleblinded trial, twenty adult, anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and surgically instrumented swine with preexisting coronary artery disease [3] underwent 3 h of hemorrhagic shock (HS; removal of 30% of the calculated blood volume and subsequent titration of mean arterial pressure to 40mmHg). Post-shock resuscitation (72h) comprised re-transfusion of shed blood, crystalloids, and norepinephrine. Animals were randomly assigned to \"placebo\" or \"STS\" (0.1g\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7h -1 for 24h). Before, at the end of and every 24h after shock, hemodynamics, blood gases, and lung function were recorded. Results: Survival rates did not differ between groups. STS-infusion attenuated the HS-induced impairment of lung mechanics and pulmonary gas exchange (Table 1 ,2), resulting in a significantly higher Horovitz/PEEP-ratio ( Figure 1 ). Conclusions: STS during acute resuscitation from HS may protect comorbid swine against HS-induced ALI. Introduction: Alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) death is a main mechanism of severe respiratory failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Classically, cell death is classified into necrosis or apoptosis. Recent studies have reported that not only apoptosis but also certain types of necrosis are molecularly regulated and that these regulated necrosis can be therapeutic targets for various diseases. However, the relative contribution of necrosis and apoptosis to AEC death in ARDS has not been elucidated. Our study aimed to elucidate which type of cell death is dominant in AEC death and to evaluate whether the regulated necrosis is involved in LPS-induced experimental ARDS. Methods: We established ARDS model by instilling 25\u03bc g of LPS intratracheally to mice. To estimate the relative proportion of apoptosis and necrosis in AEC death, we measured cytokeratin18 M65 level (total cell death marker) and M30 level (apoptosis maker) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by ELISA, and quantified propidium iodide-positive necrotic cells and TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in the lung sections. Moreover, we performed pathway enrichment analysis of gene expression data from PCR array to evaluate whether regulated necrosis pathway is associated with the ARDS model. Results: Both M65 and M30 levels were increased in the ARDS mice. The M30/M65 ratio (an indicator of the proportion of apoptosis to total cell death) in the ARDS mice was significantly lower than that of healthy controls. Moreover, the number of propidium iodidepositive necrotic cells was significantly higher than that of TUNELpositive apoptotic cells in ARDS mice.

The CMV strategy consisted of airway pressures below 30cmH 2 O. In patients with severe ARDS higher airway pressures are required to maintain lung aeration. Grasso et al. measured the transpulmonary pressure (P L ) in patients with severe ARDS and increased PEEP until P L was 25cmH 2 O, accepting airway pressures above 30cmH 2 O.

Introduction: ECCO2R facilitates the use of low tidal volumes during protective or ultraprotective mechanical ventilation when managing patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, the rate of ECCO2R required to avoid hypercapnia remains unclear.

The model assumes steady state conditions and is comprehensive from both biochemical and physiological perspectives.

Introduction: There is evidence to support that in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) under non invasive ventilation (NIV), high tidal volume (TV) and high respiratory rate (RR) are associated with NIV failure and possibly poor prognosis. We postulated that high minute ventilation (MV); or TV x RR; is associated with mortality in AHRF, when NIV is initiated. Methods: Single-center, prospective and observational study. We included consecutives AHRF adults requiring NIV. AHRF was defined as acute dyspnea with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography and PaCO2 below or equal to 45mmHg. We registered demographic and clinical parameters (including RR, MV, arterial blood gases, heart rate and blood pressure) at baseline and after 6 hours of first session of NIV, APACHE II score, diagnosis, need for intubation and ICU mortality.

Introduction: Both fentanyl and morphine are known as opioid analgesics, which blocks the brain from receiving pain signals, the route of administration and the adverse effects affect their use. We compare the efficacy of intranasal fentanyl versus intravenous morphine adults population presenting to an emergency department (ED) with acute post traumatic severe pain. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in a tertiary Emergency department between october 2016 and June 2017. Adults with severe post traumatic was included to receive either active intravenous morphine (3 mg immediately and then 1 mg every 3 min if persistence of severe pain maximum 10 mg) and intranasal placebo or active intranasal concentrated fentanyl (2 \u03bc g /kg maximum 200 \u03bc g) and intravenous placebo. Exclusion criteria: significant head injury, allergy to opiates, nasal blockage, or inability to perform pain scoring, Pain scores were rated by using a digital scale at 0, 5, 10, and 30 minutes. Routine clinical observations and adverse events were recorded. Conclusions: ISCs were related to K over-use in our BICU. Burnt patients are at risk of hepatic injury [2] , but K related hepatic injury likely occurred. Its not clearly understood mechanisms may involve a cumulative dose effect. Although involvement of concomitant medications is being investigated, K restriction policy seemed to contain hepatic disorders. Introduction: In November 2016, our institution switched from using alfentanil to fentanyl for analgesia and sedation in adult patients receiving ECMO. There is no published evidence comparing the clinical use of alfentanil vs fentanyl for sedation in ECMO patients, although some reported increased fentanyl sequestration into the circuit [1] . For these reasons, we conducted a retrospective observational study to explore whether there were any significant differences in patient outcome or adjunctive sedation before and after the switch. Methods: Outcome data and total daily doses of alfentanil or fentanyl as well as adjunctive sedation/analgesia for each patient where obtained from our clinical information system (Philips ICCA\u00ae). Data was included from ECMO patients who were sedated with alfentanil or fentanyl from 1/1/16 to 31/10/2017 until ECMO decannulation. Patients not requiring either opiate or who were switched between the two during ECMO therapy were excluded. All medicines prescribed for the management of sedation or agitation were included. For each patient an average total daily dose of each drug, was calculated. Data was analysed using STATA\u00ae. Results: Both groups were found to be statistically equivalent for mode of ECMO, age, APACHE 2 score and charlson score (p=0.202) except for BMI (p=0.007). No difference in patient outcomes were found between groups (Table 1) . Patients in the alfentanil group were found to have received significantly higher median average total daily dose of quetiapine and midazolam (Table 2) . Conclusions: No differences in patient outcomes were found between patients sedated with alfentanil compared to fentanyl. We Introduction: The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Consensus Statement recommends that for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest 12 hours without sedation is the minimum acceptable before neurological assessment. They highlighted the need to investigate the pharmacokinetics of opioid drugs in post-cardiac arrest patients, especially those treated with controlled temperature [1] . Methods: Following approval by Research Ethics Committee, we measured the blood concentration of fentanyl in 24 post-cardiac arrest patients treated with TTM following cessation of continuous infusion. The fentanyl was discontinued when the patients were rewarmed to a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius and a blood sample taken 12 hours later. The blood was analysed using a commercial ELISA kit (Neogen Corporation). Using the total dose of fentanyl administered, the half-life of fentanyl was calculated for each patient.

On the other hand, pink urine syndrome due to propofol infusion seems to be even rarer. Although its presentation is not alarming, it may well increase the risk of uric acid lithiasis, a fact that the physician in charge should always keep in mind. Conclusions: Hepatic changes related to propofol are frequently observed and should be systematically monitored to ensure patient safety. Fig. 1 (abstract P405) . Dark green urine discoloration Introduction: Clevidipine (CLEV) and propofol (PROP) are lipid-based medications used in the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypertension and sedation, respectively. No data exists regarding potential adverse effects of concurrent therapy with this combination. This study aims to evaluate the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia (hTG) and pancreatitis in ICU patients using concurrent CLEV and PROP. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective chart review in patients utilizing CLEV and PROP concurrently from February 2015 to November 2018. Patients were included if they were 18 years and older, on CLEV and PROP concurrently for at least 24 hours with no more than 2 hours of interruption at a time, had at least one triglyceride (TG) level during concurrent therapy, and admitted to the medical or surgical ICU. The incidence of hTG (defined as TG equal to or greater than 500 mg/dL) and pancreatitis (provider assessment based on 2013 American College of Gastroenterology guidelines) was evaluated. Patients with and without hTG were compared to identify risk factors for the development of hTG. Results: Of 145 patients screened, 30 patients were included which comprised 36 observations. The incidence of hTG was 13.9% with no patients developing pancreatitis. Patients with hTG had a higher median age compared to without hTG (64.5 vs. 38), p=0.015. In patients with hTG the median dose of CLEV and PROP were 16 mg/h and 42.3 mcg/kg/min, respectively, which was higher but not statistically significant when compared to patients without hTG. Cumulative lipid load (g/kg/d) was non-significantly higher in patients with hTG (2.6 vs. 1.9), p=0.599. Conclusions: The incidence of hTG was comparable to what is cited in literature for PROP alone. Patients with hTG were older, had higher median CLEV and PROP doses, and a larger cumulative lipid load compared to patients without hTG. Introduction: The 2013 Society of critical care medicine guidelines for pain, agitation and delirium suggested use of nonbenzodiazepine sedatives like dexmedetomidine which is associated with a reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, shorter length of hospital stay and a lower incidence of delirium [1] . Enteral clonidine represents a potentially less costly alternative for agitated patients with prolonged dexmedetomidine infusion. Limited literature exists examining this transition for management of agitation [2] . Methods: The critical care management initiated an action plan on the transition of patients with prolonged dexmedetomidine infusion to oral clonidine. A protocol was prepared with clinical pharmacist's assistance. Risk factors were assessed and inclusion criteria were applied as per protocol. Dexmedetomidine infusion rate was reduced gradually with oral clonidine administration in selected patients. Other rescue managements were implemented as per protocol. Oral clonidine was then tapered down by reducing frequency of administration over few days. Results: Post intervention data in 2017 showed significant decrease of dispensed doses and cost of the injections compared to 2016.

Introduction: Delirium is a serious and often underestimated condition with implications for morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. As it presents in a wide range of settings from admission to discharge, early prediction and risk assessment are essential. E-PRE-DELIRIC is a delirium prediction score which has been validated in ITU patients but not in other populations, and we conducted a quality improvement project using this score to assess its utility in other settings. Methods: Data was gathered from three patient categories: those undergoing elective surgery (ES), admissions to the Emergency Observation Unit (EOU) in the A&E, and patients with fractured neck of femur (NOF). Clinical notes were reviewed to collect data to calculate E-PRE-DELIRIC score at admission, along with a number of other clinical variables including incidence of delirium, and statistical analysis performed. Results: A total of 103 patients were included, with 52 in the ES group, 32 in the EOU group, and 19 in the NOF group respectively, with an overall average E-PRE-DELIRIC score of 17.5%. ES had a 5.4% average E-PRE-DELIRIC score, a mean age of 56 and no cases of delirium. The EOU group had an average age of 63, a 20.5% average E-PRE-DELIRIC score and no incidence of delirium. The NOF group had a mean age of 84 and an average E-PRE-DELIRIC score calculated on admission of 45.3%. This was the only group in which 5 patients developed delirium. A 50% cut off was demonstrated to be the most accurate to predict delirium in this population with a sensitivity of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.78. Conclusions: Despite the limitation of a small sample size, this project has shown that E-PRE-DELIRIC score could be a useful tool to predict patients at high risk of delirium in a non-ITU setting, with a 50% cut off in hip fracture patients. Further investigation should be conducted into the potential use of E-PRE-DELIRIC in non-ITU patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 190, "end": 212, "text": "Fig. 1 (abstract P411)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": "Comparison of long-term mortality between patients with and without delirium during admission in medical intensive care units in a university hospital N Kongpolprom King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Pulmonary Unit, Bangkok, Thailand Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P415 that delirium is linked with preoperatory comorbidities. The complexity of surgery has a big influence on the development of delirium, especially in the cases of aortic dissection. Delirium was associated with intraoperatory blood transfusions. Finally, our data point to a bridge between postoperatory electrolytic disturbances, as well as inflammation as factors potentially triggering delirium onset. Introduction: We did a retrospective case note study of mortality due to sepsis of our unit over three months as observational study in which we noted the causes of deaths, origin of sepsis, organism, patient characteristics and ICNARC Physiology scores and ICNARC H2015 model predicted risk of acute hospital mortality percentage. Methods: ICNARC data base was used to gather the data and coding was used to identify the patients with sepsis for three months. Patients mortality attributed to sepsis were identified from mortality list.Causes of death were noted from patients notes and death certificates.Cyber Lab was used to access the data and case note were ordered for review.Patients characteristics were noted including DNACPR orders and treatment withdrawal orders. Scores (apache scores, ICNARC Physiology scores, ICNARC H2015 predicted risk models of acute hospital mortality percentage) were noted. Results: Mortality percentage was found to be 17% as per codig which was reduced to 12% as 5% deaths were attributed to other causes. 44% patient had DNACPR in first 24hrs. Average length of stay was 5.58 days with median of 2.53 days.Median age was 66yrs in surviving age group and 78years in other. ICNARC physiology score 23 with predicted risk of 56.8%. Commonest cause was found Pneumonia 49% followed by Urine tract infection. 20% patients were with no source identification. Conclusions: Conclusion was made that we do need to improve the coding as significant percentage was mentioned as sepsis as cause of death where clinicians differed. Pneumonia was found to be the commonest killer in critical care followed by urine tract infection. It was pointed to be useful to carry out further audit targeting Pneumonia .Review of ICNARC Case Mix Program, development of ICNARC Physiology score, which provides excellent local use with downside of lacking international comparison was done also. Introduction: Hospitals vary widely in the quality of care they provide for septic patients. Since many septic patients present to their nearest hospital, local variations in care quality may lead to geographic disparities in access to optimal sepsis care. We sought to better understand geographic access to high quality sepsis care, taking advantage of publicly reported data on sepsis management and outcomes in a large US state. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of geographic access to high quality sepsis care, taking advantage of a 2013 New York state initiative that mandates public reporting of sepsis quality data to the state government. We linked these data to the locations of hospitals in New York state from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and population data from the US Census Bureau for 2016. We defined hospital sepsis performance using self-reported risk-adjusted mortality rates (RAMR) and defined high-performing hospitals as those with a RAMR <20%, which represents the lower end of short-term mortality typically observed in sepsis. We used ArcGIS to generate drive-time estimates and assess population access to high performing acute care hospitals for sepsis care. Results: 161 hospitals publicly reported treating 47,081 cases of sepsis from a population of 19,569,040 persons. Overall access to an acute care hospital was excellent at the 45-minute drive threshold (99.3%), good at the 30-minute threshold (95.6%), and marginal at the 15-minute threshold (84.4%). We classified 46 hospitals (28.6%) as high-performing based on a RAMR <20%. High-performing hospitals reported 12,666 (26.9%) of the total sepsis cases. High-performing hospitals were geographically dispersed across the state, although population access diminished substantially with increasing drive times (92.6% at 45-minutes, 83.5% at 30-minutes, and 59.8% at 15minutes; Figure 1 ). Conclusions: One in six people do not have timely access to a high performing hospital for sepsis care using a 30-minute threshold. [1] . This poses a significant safety risk. A previous study found that the implementation of a multidisciplinary medication safety group in intensive care increased reporting of errors and near misses [2] .

We developed a simple score to predicting ICU transfer from previous variables and performed analysis of AUC of ROC, which was compared to that of APA-CHE II. The result showed the AUC of ROC of a new score was slightly higher than the APACHE II, namely 0.797 vs. 0.720 respectively. Conclusions: The immunocompromised patients take two times higher risk than the immunocompetent ones regarding ICU transfer. The other risk factors are lower GCS, lower SBP, and higher RR. A newly developed score may be a promising tool for predicting and triaging site of care in patients who require IMCU admission. Introduction: This research aims to explore the role of situation awareness in the decision-making of patient discharge from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The discharge of these patients is a complex and, moreover, a challenging transition of care. Readmissions are undesirable given the association with a more extended hospital stay and a possible chance of higher mortality. Little is known on how the decision-making process takes place and accordingly, the role of situation awareness of patient discharge from the ICU.

Introduction: Improving prescribing practice involves changing prescriber behaviour. Education is assumed to change behaviour but other approaches may be more effective (Figure 1 ) [1] . Changes to the presentation of information and the configuration of choices have potential to rectify common prescribing errors through subtle 'nudges' [2] . The implementation of clinical information systems (CIS), including electronic prescribing, provides an opportunity to deploy strategies such as standard orders, dose limits, and product level prescribing. With an infinite number of configuration options available, clinical leaders need to know which interventions are most effective. We evaluated several of these strategies in a before and after observation study Methods: Interventions, utilising CIS nudges, were chosen to improve four areas of prescribing practice in a tertiary critical care unit using methods matched to the top 4 levels of the hierarchy. Data were collected for 2 months before and after interventions to map changes in compliance with a pre-defined standard except for the standardisation intervention where 4 months' data were collected due to low prescription numbers. No education on changes was given during the baseline data collection so any change in performance after the go-live date is entirely attributable to the intervention. Results: The change in performance for each level ranks the intervention levels in the order (highest first) forced function, automation and standardisation ( Table 1 ).

Introduction: Intensive care unit (ICU) sound pressure levels (SPL) are persistently above World Health Organisation recommendations for clinical areas [1] . This may impact patient recovery. Standard SPL monitoring records single values for each 24h period (LAeq24). We hypothesise this reporting rate is unsuitable for ICU. Methods: We measured SPL October 2016 -May 2018, logging frequency (Hz), SPL (dB), and loudness (perception of sound) every second [2] . The resulting dataset was of a size that conventional statistics programs would require computational resources not easily obtainable on standard university commodity hardware. We processed the full dataset without sampling by using distributed task dispatching, parallelism and scheduling of a cluster computing framework (Apache Spark). We created a system consisting of a single workstation (6 cores; 32GB RAM) running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Oracle Java 1.8, Apache Spark 2.3, Scala 2.11, R Core 3.5, R Studio 3.5 and sparklyr 0.8.4. We utilised the sparklyr library in R Studio to run arbitrary R code using the dplyr library. We analysed aggregate data in R Core & used ggplot (v3) to create visuals. Results: We achieved more complex analysis than standard SPL reporting with relatively modest computing resources. Specifically we identified lower SPL peaks in the early hours & loudness levels considerably higher than parallel SPL. Conclusions: Simple LAeq24 do not facilitate reflection on practice thus impetus for change is limited. Loudness data highlight the patient experience of SPL in the ICU is more intrusive than LAeq24 indicates due to high sensitivity to sounds~2-4kHz, a common frequency range for alarms.

There was inverse correlation between RV/LV ratio and fibrinogen. There was also positive correlation between RV/LV ratio and troponin for patients with and without heart failure.

The complex framework of laws and regulations governing the use and disclosure of personal data may lead to professional and financial consequences if information is disclosed inappropriately. Disclosures to the police when they concern incapacitous patients are particularly challenging, as the disclosure may have no direct benefit to the patient and may cause the patient considerable harm. Methods: We have reviewed the relevant laws and regulations to identify the circumstances in which doctors must release information regarding incapacitous patients to the police. The laws and regulations are examined to identify the extent of the disclosure required, and any requirements for the disclosure to be lawful. We have also identified laws which confer a power to disclose information about incapacitous patients, and the circumstances in which these powers can be used.

Primary outcome of study was serum creatinine (creat) on first postoperative day Methods: 40 consenting patients undergoing LRRT were randomized. In Group S-patients received intravenous fluid according to standard guidelines for intraoperative fluid infusion using Holliday-Segar rule. Patients in Group T-received intravenous fluids at start of vascular anastomosis to achieve a CVP of > 15 mm Hg at de-clamping of vessels. Serum creat, blood urea, serum electrolytes and urine output were measured in postoperative period. Hemodynamic parameters including blood pressure, CVP, cardiac output and cardiac index were compared in both groups Results: Difference in serum creat on first post-operative day, 2.04 (0.73) and 2.31 (1.19) [Mean (SD)] in Group T and S, respectively, were statistically insignificant. Total urine output on first post-operative day was significantly more in Group T as compared to Group S (P value-0.03). Graft diuresis time and graft turgidity after vascular de-clamping were significantly better in Group T. Total volume of crystalloids infused during intraoperative period was significantly less in Group T (P value-<0.001) Conclusions: Serum creat on first post-operative day was similar in patients receiving fluid according either to standard practice or according to focused infusion prior to de-clamping of vascular anastomosis despite intervention group receiving significantly less intravenous fluid intraoperatively.

Number of patients are (n) as bolus fluid. Predicted reduction in volume resulting from administration of the most concentrated format of IV medications received in the first 72 hours LOS was calculated for each patient. The percentage reduction in total IV fluid administration was then calculated. Results: 90% of patients had a positive fluid balance at 72 hours LOS. Median fluid balance at 72 hours was positive 4170.5 mls. IV medications (median 2423 mls) and maintenance fluid (median 3362.5 mls) represented a greater proportion of intravenous fluid administration than bolus fluid (median 1900 mls). Use of the most concentrated format of IV medications gave a predicted median volume reduction of 687.75 mls and a median percentage reduction in total IV administration of 11%. Conclusions: The proportion of patients with a positive fluid balance and the breakdown of IV fluid administration reflect that seen in recent studies[2].

The ODM is considered minimal invasive device. The authors compared the trending, accuracy and precision of non-invasive stroke volume measurement based on bioreactance technique and pulse wave transit time (PWTT) with ODM.

The wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) can reveal the relationship of two signals between oscillations. We aimed to evaluate prefrontal functional connectivity using WPCO analyses of cerebral oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) in patients with hemodynamic stroke. Methods: A 35 consecutive patients with anterior circulation ischemic strokes and control patients (n=34) were included for analysis. The cerebral OxyHb data were collected using multichannel fNIRS (NIRSIT, OBELAB Inc., Republic of Korea). The coherences between eight segments of prefrontal OxyHb oscillations in five frequency intervals (I, 0.6-2Hz; II, 0.145-0.6Hz; III, 0.052-0.145Hz, IV, 0.021-0.052Hz, and V, 0.005-0.0095 Hz) were analyzed using wavelet coherence analysis.

Intestinal barrier dysfunction increases the risk of bacterial translocation and the consequent development of infections. The objective of this study was to determine if gastrointestinal failure is associated with an increase in infections in patients with acute pancreatitis. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the cases admitted to a 3rd level center for acute pancreatitis, from January 2013 to April 2018. The definition of gastrointestinal failure developed by the European group was used (WGAP-ESICM). The same was recorded during the first 48 hours of admission and the persistence of it on the 5th day. A logistic regression model was used to determine if the development of gastrointestinal failure was independently associated with the development of infections. Results: Forty-six patients were included. Twelve (26%) of them developed infections during their evolution. In the multivariate analysis, the development of gastrointestinal failure during the first 5 days of hospitalization was independently associated with the development of infections (p=0.01, OR 32.5, 95% CI 1.99-529) (AUC ROC 0.95 95% CI 0.84-0.99).

Some authors advocate early surgical treatment of bone damage, while others support conservative treatment methods. Methods: From 2005 to 2017, 1,330 children with combined injuries of the musculoskeletal system (MSS) of varying severity were treated in the Department of Pediatric Traumatology of the Republican Scientific Center for Emergency Medicine of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Uzbekistan. After the accident, 998 (75%) were treated, 201 (15.1%) children fell from a height. The remaining children -131 (9.8%) of combined damage to the musculoskeletal system received as a result of household, street and sports injuries. Conservative treatment for MSS was performed in 559 (42%) of the injured children with associated injuries, operative in 771 (58%). Results: In terms of MSS operations, 571 (42.8%) were patients who underwent early surgical intervention (in the first two days), including 275 (48%) used external fixation devices, and 296 (52%) traditional surgical methods of osteosynthesis, mainly intramedullary fixation. 200 (15.1%) patients underwent delayed surgery (later than two days after the injury). So in 52 cases, osteosynthesis was carried out in a delayed manner due to unstable hemodynamics or low hemogram values during surgery for damage to internal organs, and in 148 cases after preliminary treatment of damage to the ODE using skeletal traction. Studying the immediate results of surgical treatment of children with combined injuries of MSS showed that good results were obtained in 651 (84.4%), satisfactory results in 102 (13.2%), and unsatisfactory results in 18 (2.4%). Conclusions: Early surgical stabilization of injuries of the skeletal system in severe concomitant injury in children in 84.4% of cases resulted in positive treatment results.

Medical & nursing staff undergo airway & tracheostomy/laryngectomy emergency management (T/ LEM) training early in their career, but this is often unconsolidated. In 2017 a course was introduced to support the continued professional development of staff working in Sunderland Royal Hospital Integrated Critical Care unit. Methods: The course comprises of pre-course reading, lectures, a front of neck access (FONA) workshop, orientation to equipment & high fidelity simulation. After the course candidates complete a questionnaire evaluating their prior knowledge of the UK Difficult Airway Society(DAS) & National Tracheostomy Patient Safety(NTPS) guidelines, personal experience of AE & T/LE, & self-rated confidence. Results: Nursing staff reported lower rates of formal education in AE (27%) & T/LEM (4%) compared with the medical candidates & fewer had been directly involved in an emergency. Prior to the course 73% of staff were aware of the latest DAS guidelines & 46% of the NTPS. Overall, 89% of candidates were very satisfied with the course, & 30% of medical & 59% of nursing staff reported an increase in selfrated confidence score by 1 point, & 32% & 28% by 2+ points from their baseline. Conclusions: Introduction of the course improved the awareness of contemporary guidelines, self-rated confidence in the event of encountering an airway or T/LE, equipment familiarity & performing FONA in the event of failure to oxygenate during intubation on critical care.

In recent years, share of drug resistant AcB strains across Europe was found to be steadily increasing. Consequently, in 2017, AcB was included in the WHO global priority list of drug-resistant bacteria to highlight the need for the research development. The aim of this study was to identify the relation of risk factors for ventilator-The VAP risk factors: higher SAPS II score, increased hospital length of stay prior to ICU and mechanical ventilation were related to higher resistance profile of AcB. Carbapenem use was found to be associated with the risk of MDR AcB VAP. Mortality due to drug-resistant AcB VAP was high, but not associated with AcB drug resistance profile. Thus, timely mechanical ventilation and ICU treatment may reduce the risk of VAP due to higher drug-resistant AcB, especially in more severely ill patients.Introduction: sepsis following traumatic and surgical intervention increases morbidity, mortality, cost and length of patient stay in hospital. The aim of this study was to identify the major pathogens associated with wounds infection and to review their antimicrobial reactions. 6%) mainly Staphylococcus aureus. This requires strong infection control actions to enhance patient care. The guidelines categorized a higher proportion of patients with high risk of MDRP. Previous isolation of MDRP showed the best performance for MDR prediction. Conclusions: 7yrs study revealed Acinetobacter spp. as predominant, mostly MDR pathogen of HA GNR bacteremia in ICUs. HA MDR GNR bacteremia was related with male gender, elderly and AKI. High sensitivity of GNR to carbapenems was found. High rate of mortality 74% was associated with male gender, mechanical ventilation, septic shock, AKI and MDR strain. Our objective is to identify the differences in risk factors and outcomes between patients who did and did not acquire KPCproducing bacteria during their stay in the ICU of an university hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We designed a nested casecontrol study of a retrospective cohort from May 2014 to June 2015. Three hundred and thirty nine patients were admitted to the ICU. 36 cases (patients infected or colonized by KPC-producing bacteria and 292 'controls' (all other patients who did not have MDR isolation). The two groups were compared according to demographic clinical and microbiological data.Results: There was no significant differences in gender, age, severity scores between the two groups. Patients with KPC-producing bacteria had longer ICU and hospital stays than control patients and they required more life-support such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and dialysis. In hospital mortality rate was higher in KPC-Colonization was associated with longer ICU and hospital LOS, more requirements of life-support and higher in-hospital mortality rate.

We investigated parameters upon hospital admission to predict MP infection. Methods: All patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital 2013 -2017 for CAP with confirmed etiology were analyzed using logistic regression analyses and area under the receiver operator characteristics curves for associations between demographic, clinical and laboratory features and the causative pathogen. Results: We analyzed 568 patients with CAP, including 47 (8%) MP; 152 (27%) with SP and 369 (65%) with influenza or other viruses. Comparing MP and SP, younger age (OR 0.56 per 10 years, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), lower neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (OR 0.9, 0.82-0.99) and elevated CRP/PCT ratio (OR 15.04 (5.23-43.26) for a 400mg/g cut-off) independently predicted MP. With a ROC AUC of 0.91 (0.80 for the >400mg/g cutoff), the CRP/PCT ratio was the strongest predictor of MP versus SP.

Although the femoral site is preferred, it remains difficult to handle in case of abdominal pelvic surgery or ventral position. In addition it does not allow to develop a diagnostic approach. The purpose of our study was to see if ultrasound guided cannulation of the internal jugular vein could be an alternative to the femoral one. Methods: It was a prospective, monocentric, observational, and comparative study conducted in the anesthesia resuscitation department of the Military Hospital Main Instruction of Tunis over a period of 12 months. There were 118 patients, 58 in the group \"guided femoral vein catheterization (FVC)\" and 60 in the group \"guided internal jugular vein catheterization (IJVC)\". The rate of failure and complications (mechanical, infectious and thrombotic) was compared; the number of punctures and access times too. The threshold of statistical significance was chosen at 0,05. Results: The failure rate was 10.3% for FVC, compared to 8.3% for IJVC (p = 0.47, (p >0.05)). The risk of hematoma was 3.4% for FVC, 1.7% for IJVC (p = 0.5).No case of pneumothorax was noted, 2 malpositions of the IJVC were reported.Catheter-related infection was 6.9% for FVC, 3.3% for IJVC (p = 0.3). Venous thrombosis was 20.7% for FVC, 10% for IJVC, (p = 0.08). The number of attempts and the access time were lower for IJVC (respectively 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 and 204s \u00b1 46.3 vs 1.9 \u00b1 0.7 and 256.5s \u00b1 90.4 for the FVC, p <0.0001).

Moreover, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is currently the first-line tool for evaluating the hemodynamic conditions in such patients. We sought to assess the ability of TTE to estimate and to track changes in CVP in critically ill patients. Methods: In 31 patients (25 mechanically ventilated and four with atrial fibrillation), concomitant TTE examination and CVP measurement (internal jugular catheter) were performed before and after a passive leg raising test (n=10) or the infusion of 500-mL of saline (n=21). Results: After pooling all values, CVP was only correlated to the endexpiratory inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and the respiratory variations of the IVC diameter (r=0.40 and r=-0.26, respectively, p<0.05). At baseline, an end-expiratory IVC diameter \u226414 mm predicted a CVP \u226410 mmHg with a specificity of 100% (95%CI: 81-100%) but a sensitivity of 29% (95%CI: 8-58%). An end-expiratory IVC diameter >26 mm predicted a CVP >10 mmHg with a specificity of 100% (95%CI: 77-100%) but a sensitivity of 0% (95%CI: 0-20%). The respiratory variations of the IVC diameter could predict neither a CVP \u226410 mmHg nor a CVP >10 mmHg (AUC=0.683, p=0.08). Relative changes in CVP were weakly correlated to relative changes in S/D ratio and in velocity-time integral (VTI)-systolic filling fraction of the suprahepatic vein flow (r=0.44 and r=0.43, respectively, p<0.05). The concordance rate between changes in CVP and S/D ratio or changes in VTI-systolic filling fraction was 48% and 55%, respectively. Conclusions: In critically-ill patients, TTE cannot reliably estimate CVP or track changes in CVP induced by a passive leg raising test or fluid administration. However, an end-expiratory IVC diameter \u226414 mm or >26 mm can predict a CVP \u226410 mmHg or >10 mmHg, respectively, with a specificity of 100%.P166 Lung water assessment by lung ultrasonography A Ramos 1 , A Dogliotti 2 , F Acharta 3 , D Latasa 1 , F Gerber 1 , J Robles 1 , C Lovesio 1 Grupo Oro\u00f1o, Critical Care, Rosario, Argentina; 2 Grupo Oro\u00f1o, Statistics and Epidemiology, Rosario, Argentina; 3 Sanatorio Parque, Critical Care, Carlos Pellegrini, Argentina Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P166Introduction: The objective was to investigate the accuracy of lung ultrasonography in the quantification of lung water in critically ill patients by using transpulmonary thermodilution technique as the gold standard for the determination of extravascular lung water level (ELWI). Methods: Prospective study of 20 consecutive, fully mechanically ventilated patients who required hemodynamic monitoriztion with EV1000, were included. ELWI was determined using the transpulmonary thermodilution technique, a value above 10 ml/kg was considered as the presence of pulmonary water . Semiquantitative ultrasound assessment of lung water was performed by determining the ultrasound B-line, defined as the total number of B-lines detectable in an anterolateral lung ultrasonography examination, \u2264 3 B-lines was considered as absence of pulmonary water and >4 B-lines was considered as the presence of lung water. Results: Good correlations was found between the presence of more than 3 B-line and ELWI; \u2264 3 B-lines, Kappa < 0 More than 3 B-lines by ultrasonography agreed with transpulmonary thermodilution technique. For the entire population: >3 B-lines by ultrasonography has a good positive predicted value.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical utility of monitoring acute changes in serum lactate levels for assessing the response to BFT. Methods: This is a prospective observational study in critically ill adult patients, including patients who received either 1 L crystalloids or 500 ml colloids within 30 to 40 min after lactate measurement. Cardiac index (CI) and serum lactate levels were measured before and after BFT. Patients with base-line levels of lactate <2mmol/L (Group 1), and patients with lactate \u22652mmol/L (Group 2) were analyzed separately. Responders to BFT were considered those who had an increase in CI \u226515%. Results: We assessed 69 critically ill patients who received BFT.

We analyzed interconsultations to ICU for CPA in this period. Age, sex, Clinical Frailty Scale(CFS), causes, limitation of CPR and outcomes were determined. For statistical analysis of the data, quantitative variables are expressed as means +/-standard deviation; qualitative variables as percentages. The statistic analysis was made by using Chi scuare test. Multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. Results: We analyze 106 patients, 18 of them were excluded. Frailty divide patients in 2 categories: prefrail and frail (PF-F)(CFS>3) and non-frail (NF)(CFS<4).

Example of mitoPO2 and StO2 during CPBTable 1 (abstract P176). Univariate analysisIntroduction: While there is increasing evidence for the importance of chest compressions for the outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), recommendations for ventilation strategies during CPR are rather poor. Although continuous ventilation at 10 breaths per minute and the avoidance of hyperventilation is suggested after intubation, the guidelines provide no information regarding the implementation of differentiated ventilation strategies (DVS)[1]. The present survey was designed to determine the DVS used in the prehospital setting by German emergency physicians (GEP) during CPR Methods: An anonymous web-based questionnaire encompassing 10 questions was sent to GEP during September and October 2018. The EP were asked to specify the ventilator model, their preferred VS during CPR and the initial set of ventilator parameters, i.e.: volume-vs. pressure-controlled ventilation, respiratory rate, tidal volume, maximum and minimum pressure limits. Results: 61 % of the questionnaires were completed (151/247). 95 % of respondents had preclinical access to respirators with the ability to perform DVS. 75 % of the participants chose volume-controlled, 19 % pressure-controlled ventilation modes during CPR. 6 % of participants indicated that they were performing manual ventilation. 53% chose a non-guidance-compliant ventilation with respiratory rates > 12/min.

Conclusions: Despite the possibility of preclinical implementation of differentiated VS, GEP predominantly use volume-controlled ventilation modes. In contrast to the current guidelines, 53 % of GEP hyperventilate the patients under the CPR.

Many of the post cardiac arrest patients will be admitted at the Intensive Care Unit, however little is known about these patients. This patient group is relevant, because of the amount of patients and their vulnerability. For this reason, this study was set up to describe the characteristics and clinical outcomes of cardiac arrest patients admitted at the Intensive Care Unit. Methods: We used data from the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation registry[1]  from 2010-2016 in the Netherlands. All adult patients admitted at the Intensive Care Unit with cardiac arrest as admission diagnosis were included. Results: In this study, characteristics and clinical outcomes of 26,056 cardiac arrest patients are described. Over time, the survival rate of Out-ofhospital cardiac arrest patients significantly decreases, while the survival rate of In-hospital cardiac arrest patients showed no significant relation. Conclusions: This study shows a nationwide overview of the characteristics and outcomes of cardiac arrest patients admitted at the Intensive Care Unit. The decrease in mortality rate of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients may point to improvements made in post cardiac arrest care, however future research has to be done to specify the cause of this decrease.1.

Methods: 20 consecutive patients resuscitated for OHCA were included to the study. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed from subcostal view during ongoing chest compressions in all of them. This was repeated three times during CPR in each patient and EtCO2 levels were registered. From each investigation, video loop was recorded. Later on, maximal and minimal diameter of LV, RV and IVC were obtained from the recorded loops and compression index of LV (LVCI), RV (RVCI) and IVC (IVCCI) was calculated as (maximal-minimal/maximal diameter)x100. CImax defined as the value of LVCI or RVCI, whichever was greater was also assessed.

This study aimed to compare cut-off values of this time interval for neurologically favourable onemonth survival between bystander-witnessed OHCA groups receiving chest compression-only (CC-only) and chest compression + ventilation (CC+V )first CPR. Methods: From nationwide OHCA database during 2014-2016, we extracted 82,888 bystander-witnessed OHCA cases. The cut-off values for neurologically favourable one-month survival were determined using Yoden index in the two groups receiving CC-only and CC+V first CPR before and after propensity-score matching including characteristics of OHCA associated with bystander CPR. Results: The matching procedure did not alter the cut-off values (Table 1). The values were 3 and 7 min in CC-only and CC+V first CPR groups, respectively. When analysed for subgroups, the difference in cut-off value was largest in subgroup of presumed non-cardiac aetiology: 3 vs. 8 min. A hazard model disclosed that effect of first CPR on survival was more largely diminished by delay in start of time first CPR in CC-only group than a in CC+V group: hazard ratio (95% CI), 1.89 (1.84-1.94). The overall survival rates (8.9% before matching and 8.6% after matching) in CC-only group were higher than those in CC+V group (5.6% and 6.2%). However odds ratio (OR) was small when adjusted by other factors associated with survival: adjusted OR (95% CI), 1.23 (1.15-1.32) before matching, 1.13 (1.09-1.22) after matching. Conclusions: The effect of CC-only CPR on survival after OHCA was more largely diminished by delay in initiation than that of CC+ V CPR.Table 1 (abstract P185).

Indicators of chest compression qualityFig. 1 (abstract P187). Chest compressions in kneeling position while intra-hospital transportationIntroduction: In cardiac arrest, resuscitative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provides continuous unobstructed visualisation of the heart during each compression in real-time fashion enabling instant feedbacks to improve the quality of subsequent chest compressions. The 2015 American Heart Association only regarded resuscitative TEE as an adjunct to find treatable causes and guide treatment decisions[1]. Methods: We presented a case series of cardiac arrest situations incorporating the use of resuscitative TEE to review the effectiveness of high quality chest compression following 2015 AHA recommendations. Results: Four cardiac arrest patients underwent resuscitative TEE during CPR. Hands were placed at lower half of sternum and compressed to the depth of between 5 to 6cm. Mid esophageal four chamber view (to visualise left ventricular compression) and mid esophageal long axis view (to visualise aortic compression) were reviewed. In 3 out of 4 cases, chest compressions led to aortic outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction necessitating corrective hand relocations. Conclusions: Chest compression is a blind intervention and external chest landmarks do not always correlate with the location of left ventricle[2]. Maximal compression at the recommended lower half of sternum might result in compression of the LVOT. Resuscitative TEE is a robust tool that should be equipped in centres that strive for better outcomes among cardiac arrest patients.P189Abnormal movements but not agonal breathing is a concomitant sign associated with shockable initial rhythm and better outcomes in \"sudden\" cardiac arrest H Inaba, H Kurosaki, K Takada, A Yamashita, Y Tanaka Kanazawa University Grauate School of Medicine, Department of Circulatory Emergency and Emergency Medical Science, Kanazawa, Japan Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P189 Introduction: Emergency medical service (EMS) personnel may detect sudden onset of concomitant signs in EMS-witnessed out-ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study aimed to investigate the incidences of concomitant signs and their associations with characteristics and outcomes of EMS-witnessed \"sudden\" OHCAs. Methods: In addition to standard recommendation, EMS prospectively recorded concomitant signs which lead to start of advance life support in 385 cases with EMS-witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) during the period of April 2012 to March 2018. Detailed database was completed after additional interview to EMS personnel. After excluding 268 cases with impending cardiac arrest, 117 cases were analysed. Results: In addition to common and standard signs for cardiac arrest, the following signs were recorded as a concomitant signs which lead to start\u00a1\u00a1of advanced life support: abnormal movements of extremities and jaw which mimic tonic convulsion (17.9%), abnormal eye movement or position (3.4%), shout or groan (5.1%) and vomiting (5.1%).

Angiographic findings in patients in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization after OHCA (n = 64)Introduction: A do-not-attempt-resuscitation (DNAR) order may be issued when it is against the wishes of the patient to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), or when CPR is considered medically futile; that is when the chances of good outcome are minimal. A prearrest prediction tool can aid clinicians in consolidating objective findings with clinical judgement in the decision process for DNAR orders. Our aim was prediction model update of the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation score for favorable neurologic survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Methods: The prediction model update was based on a retrospective cohort of 717 adult IHCAs in Stockholm County 2013-2014 identified through the Swedish Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Registry. It included redefinition and reduction of predictor variables, and addition of the predictor variable chronic comorbidity, assessed as Charlson Comorbidity Index, to create a full model consisting of 9 predictors. The outcome was favorable neurologic survival defined as Cerebral Category Score \u22642 at discharge. The full model was recalibrated based on 1000-bootstrap resampling calibration. Model performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), calibration and classification accuracy with a cutoff of 3% likelihood of favorable neurologic survival. Results: We call the updated prediction model the Prediction of outcome for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (PIHCA) score.

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, adult patients with OHCA who were admitted to a Japanese tertiary care hospital from April 2012 to November 2018 and underwent veno-arterial ECMO were included. Patients were either transferred by emergency medical service (EMS only group) or with physician using RRC (RRC group). Primary outcome was door-to-ECMO time. Secondary outcome was onset-to-ECMO time, 24-hour survival, 30-day survival and neurologically favorable outcome. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the outcome between the two groups. Results: A total of 46 patients were included in this study, and outcome data were available for all patients. The door-to-ECMO time was significantly shorter in the RRC group than in the EMS only group (median, 20 min vs. 33 min; P =0.004). Additionally, the onsetto-ECMO time was significantly shorter (median, 50 min vs. 60 min; P =0.005). There was no significant difference in the 24-hour survival, 30-day survival rates and neurologically favorable outcome. Conclusions: The physician-based RRC system was associated with a shorter door-to-ECMO time.

The purpose of this study was to establish prognostic factors for ECPR in adult patients with OHCA. Methods: This retrospective, observational study was conducted on OHCA patients aged over 18 who were delivered to the ER from January 2001 to December 2017. And we enrolled the patients who were performed ECPR immediately after arrival and survived 24 hours or more. These patients were divided into ICU survival groups (S) and non-survival groups (NS) and evaluated of ICU outcome of ECPR. We reviewed medical records collected at the time of admission and compared demographic data and experimental data between the two groups.Results: In this study, 70 patients were included, 22 patients (31.4%) were S (median age 55 years [IQR, 42-64 years]) and 48 patients were NS (median age 59 years [IQR, 53-65 years]). There was a significant difference between S and NS with the ratio of witnesses [S 21(95.5%) vs non-survivor 37(77.1%), p=0.013], the ratio of abnormal pupil diameter (5mm or more, 2mm or less)[S 7(31.8%) vs NS 36(75.0%), p<0.001] and a presence of pupillary light reflex[S 9(40.9%) vs NS 3(6.3%), p<0.001]. Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed for 5 explanatory variables (pupillary light reflex, dilated pupils (5mm or more), normal pupil diameter(3-4mm), the witness, and ventricular fibrillation), indicated pupillary light reflex (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.14-32.50, p=0.03) and dilated pupils (OR, 0.06; 95%CI, 0.004-0.889, p=0.04) to be an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: In this study, we suggested that pupil findings on hospital arrival might become predictive factors of ECPR for adult patients with OHCA.P197 Spontaneous CPR simulations in the ICU N Tabak, Y Polishuk, E Kishinevsky, G Bregman Kaplan Medical Center, ICU, Rehovot, Israel Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P197Introduction: Quick identification and professional treatment of conditions requiring CPR must be practiced by all staff, with refresher simulations providing updated knowledge. Spontaneous CPR simulations lead to faster staff response times, improves team work, and increases the effectiveness of treatment during real CPR situations. Providing refresher resuscitation courses are not enough, and lack the advantages of spontaneous simulations, specifically practicing performing CPR. Methods: The simulations all based on American Heart Association protocols and based on clinical situations of typical ICU patients. The simulations take place in a room with specialized equipment with feedback given immediately to participants. The participants of the simulations are Nursing staff and Doctors that are currently on shift, plus trainees and medical students. The simulations are run by expe-rienced staff members. The simulations are held once a week covering all shifts. Judgement of staff performance uses a tool based on AHA protocols and checks effectiveness of CPR management, specifically response time, correct usage of equipment and devices, performance of chest compressions, intubation, drug management and team work. Results: During the period between 03/17 -10/18 47 spontaneous CPR simulations were performed in the ICU, the majority on the morning shift. During this period at least 57% of Nursing staff and 66% of Medical staff practiced CPR simulations at least twice, with an overall improvement in performance of 25%, improved identification of conditions requiring CPR, quicker response times, use of appropriate equipment and increased effective team work. Conclusions: Improving resuscitation skills needs practice and team work, a continuous process which needs to include all Nursing and Medical staff and involves repeat CPR simulations. There is a need to expand simulations to cover all shifts. Staff responded positively to this process and reported increased confidence when managing real life CPR situations.Maastricht UMC, Intensive Care, Maastricht, Netherlands; 2 Maastricht UMC, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maastricht, Netherlands Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P198Introduction: ECPR requires rapid activation of a multidisciplinary team and a well-organized ECPR infrastructure[1]. In May 2017, we started optimising our ECPR infrastructure for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by introducing a dedicated ECPR cart, regular training sessions and simulation cases, and by evaluating all procedures. This infrastructure is also used for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). The objective of this retrospective analysis was to determine whether these changes had an effect on the time to extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in IHCA as well.Methods: A single-centre, retrospective review was conducted a year after the start of training. All adult patients (\u226518 years) with a witnessed, refractory IHCA who received ECPR from 2013 to 2018 were included. The primary outcome was time-to-ECLS, defined as time from start of arrest to adequate flow on ECLS. Data are presented as median[IQR]. Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann-Whitney U test. Results: In the first period (2013 -April 2017), 13 patients received ECPR with a median age of 62 [60-67], 69.2% were male and with a In conclusion, optimisation of the ECPR infrastructure significantly reduced time-to-ECLS, which may ultimately improve clinical outcome after ECPR for IHCA.P199Interest of the \"high fidelity\" medical simulation as a pedagogical tool in training of medical residentsW Sellami, I Ben mrad, Z Hajjej, M Chniti, I Labbene, M Ferjani Department of critical care medicine and anesthesiology Military Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P199Introduction: Medical simulation has become an essential teaching method for all health professionals.

The adherence rate to LPV strategy reported in literatures is 40%[1,2]. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanical ventilation (MV) management according to LPV strategy applied to patient admitted to SICU. Methods: This was a prospective observational study, which included all adult patients admitted SICU and required MV support for more than 12 hours. Patients requiring MV support for more than 24 hours prior to SICU admission, those re-admitted to the SICU, those requiring non-invasive MV support, and moribund cases were excluded. The LPV strategy was defined as ventilation with tidal volume of <8 mL/kg of predicted body weight plus PEEP of at least 5 cm H2O applied to patients at SICU admission. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and analyzed. Results: There were 149 patients included in this study. The mean age and mean APACHE II score were 65.3\u00b114.1 years old and 12.6 \u00b15.5, respectively, and 65.1% were male. Half of patients (49.7%) were admitted to SICU following planned elective surgery and 73.2% required MV support following general anesthesia. The adherence rate to the LPV strategy was 37.6%. Independent factors associated with receiving LPV strategy were smoking (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.95-8.87) and PaO2 (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00). Independent factors associated with SICU mortality included APCHE II score (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04-1.47), sepsis at SICU admission (OR, 5.27; 95% CI, 1.02-27.09) and LPV strategy (OR, 14.08; 95% CI 2.58-76.90). Conclusions: The adherence rate to LPV strategy in patients admitted to SICU was 37.6%. Nevertheless, receiving LPV strategy was independently associated with SICU mortality. Whether this was just another marker of severity or this really caused such miserable outcome, further studies are warranted.P386 Diaphragm excursion and contraction velocity in patients with grade I and II of intra-abdominal hypertension V Hosti\u0107, M \u0160iranovi\u0107, M Vu\u010di\u0107, B Rode, A Horvat, \u017d Gavranovi\u0107, L Videc Penavi\u0107, H Krolo Videka, A Gop\u010devi\u0107 UHC Sestre milosrdnice, ICU, Department of Anesthesiology, Zagreb, Croatia Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P386Introduction: The aim of this observational study was to determine diaphragmatic motility range using ultrasound (US) in patients with moderate range of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) following major abdominal surgery procedure after completing spontaneus breathing trial (SBT) protocol and possible validation of US in predicting successful weaning in patients with IAH. Methods: Study enrolled 43 adult patients so far and all of them were successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. We measured maximal altitude of diaphragmatic contractions and velocity of both hemi diaphragmatic poles using US sector probe, 4 MHz in both 2D and M mode as previously described[1]  after completing SBT protocol. Patients with pulmonary and neuromuscular disseases were excluded. Measurements are expresed as mean value with p value of 0.05 considered significant. IBM SPSS v 20 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Patients were divided into normal (8.7mmHg; n=11) and high (16.3 mmHg; n=32) group by the value of IAP. In normal group there was no difference in excursions between right and left hemidiaphragm (17.6 vs 21.5 mm; p=0.09) whereas there was difference in contraction velocity between sides (19.7 vs 19.2 mm/s; p=0.03). Regarding the high group, contraction velocity was equal between the right and left hemidiaphragm (21.3 vs 25.1 mm/s; p=0.15) but diaphragm contraction was higher at right hemidiaphragm (26.9 vs 25.0 mm; p=0.02). There was no difference between normal and high group in RSBI values (34.2 vs 40.8; p=0.35). Conclusions: Current literature suggests that diaphragm US could be a useful and accurate tool to predicz extubation success or failure[2]. Preliminary results from our study suggest that the safe range of right diaphragm excursion for weaning the patients with IAH is 26.9 mm.Introduction: Handgrip strength (HGS) is an alternative measure to assess peripheral muscle strength and is correlated with the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, with promising values for diagnosing intensive care unit-acquired muscle weakness (ICUAMW)[1]. Since ICUAMW has been associated with delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV)[2], we hypothesized that peripheral muscle strength evaluated by both the MRC scale score and HGS is independently associated with failure on the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and the duration of weaning from MV, Methods: Design: A prospective observational study Patients: Adult patients with more than 48 hours of MV who were eligible for weaning Measurements: Evaluation for muscle strength by the MRC scale and HGS before each SBT. Setting: Three general ICUs of 2 academic hospitals Results: Before the first SBT, the MRC score (p<0.001) and HGS (p=0.010) were significantly different according to the type of ventilatory weaning. Between the SBT failure and success groups, only the MRC score was significantly different (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, only the MRC score was significantly associated with SBT failure (odds ratio [OR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.97, p=0.002) and difficult or prolonged weaning (OR 0.91, 95% 0.87-0.96, p=0.001).

The 6MWT is performed in accordance with international guidelines.Were collected: clinical features at admission, severity of illness and ICU course. The walked and predicted distances and their ratio (6MWT ratio) were calculated. Patients were followed up via phone calls 3 months after discharge. Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were used to assess test performance to predict mortality, future exacerbations and readmissions after 3 months of ICU discharge. Results: Among 102 patients admitted for AE/COPD during the study period, 75(73.5%) were included. General characteristics were: age, 66.4\u00b19.5 years old; Charlson index>3, 40(53.3%); COPD GOLD D, 65(86.7%); median SAPSII score, 27[22-34]; initial invasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (26.7%); median length of stay, 10[6-16] days.

A IngMar Medical ASL 5000 Breathing Simulator (Software Version 3.6) was used to simulate 3 different lung mechanics: a normal patient (Compliance (C) 60 ml/cmH2O, airway resistance (R) 10 cmH20/l/s), an obstructive patient (C 90, R 20) and a restrictive patient (C 25, R 10). Each respiratory mechanic was tested at two respiratory rates (RR 15/min and 30/min), with 3 different levels of patient effort (Pmusc -3, -6 and -12cmH2O) and at two different pressure support levels (PS 10 and 20cmH2O) with a constant PEEP of 5cmH2O. All the data and waveforms patterns were recorded by the IngMar Medical ASL 5000 software and analysed with MedCalc (version 18.11 MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).

However, PEEP might have a negative effect on cardiovascular hemodynamics, it is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different PEEP levels on both left and right ventricular strains by using speckle tracking imaging in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG)[1]. Methods: We prospectively analyzed 10 CABG surgery patients. After initiation of mechanical ventilation and before sternotomy 5, 10 and 20 cmH2O of PEEP were applied in 5 minutes intervals consequently. After stabilization at each PEEP level four and two chamber images of left and right ventricle were recorded using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). SPSS 17 software was used for the statistical analysis of the data. Results: The mean age of study patient (85% male) was 59.7 \u00b1 10.5 years. Intraoperative mean, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures and heart rate were similar at the three PEEP levels. Mean right ventricle strain value significantly decreased at 20 cmH2O PEEP when compared with other two PEEP levels (p=0.005 for both) (Table 1). Mean SR values decreased at 20 cmH2O PEEP when compared with 5 and 10 cmH2O PEEP (p<0.05). Right ventricle velocity reduced with incremental PEEP increases (p<0.05). Conversely left ventricle strain, SR and velocity did not change significantly.Table 1 (abstract P392).

Current practice is to use scales to assess depth of sedation based on clinical criteria (CA). Bispectral index (BIS) monitors may overcome the constraints of the sedation scales (e.g. subjectivity). Our aim was to find out if BIS monitoring improves outcomes and resource utilization in ICU mechanically ventilated adults. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and several other databases. We selected only randomized controlled trials. We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures and Revman 5.3 software for data collection and analysis. Results: We identified 4245 studies. Four studies (256 participants) met the inclusion criteria. BIS monitor was used in all the studies. Sedation assessment tools for CA included the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS), Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), or subjective CA utilizing traditional clinical signs. Three of the four studies were classified as high risk. There was no difference in ICU length of stay (median 8, interquartile range (IQR) 4 to 14 versus 12 (6 to 18); N=50; low quality evidence). There was clinically non-significant effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -0.02 days (95% CI -0.13 to 0.09; 2 studies; N= 155; I2 = 0%; low quality evidence)). We could not measure difference in the cost because of different sedation protocols and agents used. Clinically relevant adverse events (e.g. self-extubation) were not reported in any study. GRADE quality of evidence was very low. Conclusions: In this Cochrane review we found insufficient evidence of benefit of BIS compared to clinical assessment scales for sedation monitoring in critically ill mechanically ventilated adults.P397 Is intranasal fentanyl so effective than parenteral morphine for managing acute post traumatic pain in adults?

Concomitantly, ketamine (K) use, considered innocuous and with a broad safety range, increased as co-analgesic, then as hypnotic when concern about ischemia increased. Based on scarce literature reporting K abuserelated ISCs[1], we finally restricted K use. We hypothesized that hepatic disorders were related to K use in our BICU. Methods: All patients admitted to our BICU were reviewed in a retrospective study from 01/01/07 to 30/06/18 with demographic data, burn/injury severity scores, and hepatic biochemistry. Annual mean K consumption per patient was used as a population exposure inde. Three periods were compared: P1 (2007-2013) as historical period, P2 (2013-2017) from 1st ISC case on, and P3 ( 2017-2018) with implemented K restriction policy. Comparisons used ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis or Wald tests as approriate. Results: 1640 patients were included. Patients were younger but more severe in P1 (tab.1). K use in P2 was higher than in P1-P3 (p<0.01). Hepatic disorders significantly differed between periods (Table 1,Fig.1), and matched K use.

Hershey Medical Center, Public Health Sciences, Hershey, United States Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P399Introduction: Opioid infusions are routinely administered in intensive care units (ICUs) and survivors are often discharged on opioid therapy. These patients are at a risk for chronic opioid use, addiction or abuse, overdose and opioid use disorder. Patients undergoing major abdominal surgeries often require postoperative ICU care with pain management including the use of opioid infusions. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of new persistent opioid use in opioid na\u00efve patients that underwent major abdominal surgery, requiring postoperative ICU care and receiving opioid infusions, across the US Veterans Health Administration over a 17-year period. Methods: Between 2000 and 2016, we identified a cohort of patients without prescriptions for opioid containing medications over the sixmonth period prior to admission (preoperatively opioid na\u00efve) that then underwent major abdominal surgery. We identified patients admitted to ICU for >24 hours that also received opioid infusions. New persistent opioid use was defined as the continuation of prescriptions for opioid containing medications beyond three months after discharge. Results: Of 34,442 patients that underwent major abdominal surgery nationwide within the VHA, between 2000-2016, 13,867 were opioid na\u00efve with an ICU stay for > 24 hrs after surgery. Of these, 74.7% (n=10,367) received opioid infusions during their stay. New persistent opioid use was present in 2.26% (95% CI, 1.9-2.5), and steadily declined annually(Figure 1). Conclusions: Among preoperatively opioid na\u00efve US veterans undergoing major abdominal surgery with postoperative ICU admission, a majority received opioid infusions. Of these under 2.5% developed new persistent opioid use. Patient factors, ICU pain management strategies, and primary care practices where opioid prescriptions may be continued after initial postoperative recovery, may combine to yield the observed rates of new Persistent Post-intensive care opioid use after major abdominal surgery.P400 Outcomes and use of adjunct agents in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) sedated with alfentanil vs. fentanyl: a single centre retrospective analysis M Barker 1 , A Dixon 2 , L Camporota 3 , N Barrett 2 , R Wan 1 Guys and St Thomas\u00b4NHS Foundation Trust, Pharmacy/Critical Care, London, United Kingdom; 2 Guys and St Thomas\u00b4NHS Foundation Trust, Critical Care, London, United Kingdom; 3 Guys and St Thomas\u00b4NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P400", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF199": {"text": "abstract P398).

Results: Both nerve blocks produced significantly lower pain scores than the purely pharmacological approach (MP 5.4+0.6 vs. FNB 2.8 +1.6 and FICNB 2.9+1.2 after first postoperative hour). Consequently, the first group required more additional morphine and paracetamol after first hour compared to FNB and FICNB groups. Morphine was significantly more frequently added in the MP group (3.4+0.4 mg/kg iv) than in the FNB (2.1+0.5 mg/kg iv) and FICNB (2.5+0.4 mg/kg iv). Maximal duration of analgesia was 4.9+0.5 h in MP group compared to 8.8+0.7 h and 8.1+0.8 h after FNB and FICNB, respectively. Conclusions: Postoperative analgesia with blocks enables better pain control, better cardiovascular stability and less adverse effect than the classical morphine-based analgesia.McGill University Health Centre, Department of Pharmacy, Montreal, Canada; 2 McGill University Health Centre, Department of Critical Care, Montreal, Canada; 3 Mount Sinai Hospital, Department of Pharmacy and Medicine, Toronto, Canada; 4 McGill University, Ingram School of Nursing, Montreal, Canada; 5 McGill University Health Centre, Department of Psychiatry, Montreal, Canada Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P403", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF203": {"text": "1 , V Tangsujaritvijit 2 , A Trisataya 2 , C Suthisisang 3 , P Dilokpattanamongkol 4 Department of Pharmaceutical Care, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; 2 Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; 4 Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P404Introduction: Protocol and dosing strategies of opioid therapy in intensive care units (ICUs) have been proposed in order to optimize therapeutic effect and avoid adverse drug reactions. But, there is a gap of evidence regarding opioid withdrawal in critically ill adults[1]. The objectives of this study are to explore an incidence, risk associations and clinical impact of opioid withdrawal reactions. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in 5 ICUs and an intermediate care unit, university hospital, Thailand. Mechanically ventilated adults receiving continuous infusion of fentanyl for \u2265 24 hours were eligible. Observation for withdrawal reaction using signs and symptoms according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, 5th edition (DSM-V) criteria was performed at baseline, 1st, 3rd, 6th, 24th and 72nd hours after discontinuation or rate reduction of fentanyl. Patients who manifested at least 3 signs and/or symptoms were classified as withdrawal group. Change of heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were also hourly recorded during observational period. Results: During 6 months of study period, 39 patients with 71 observations were included. Eight participants (20.5%) developed withdrawal symptoms. Body mass index (BMI), weaning rate of fentanyl infusion and increment of MAP were positively correlated with withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, two patients in non-withdrawal group suddenly developed hypertensive urgency after interruption of fentanyl infusion. However, there was no significant difference between withdrawal group and non-withdrawal group in ventilator days and ICU length of stay.Conclusions: Health care providers should observe withdrawal symptoms in mechanically ventilated adults receiving fentanyl infusion for \u2265 24 hours, especially patients with high BMI and receiving rapid weaning rate. Additionally, alteration of MAP should be further investigated as signs of opioid withdrawal.P405 Intriguing urine discolorations after propofol infusion observed in an Intensive Care Unit A Tsifi 1 , S Stefanova 1 , S Avgeri 1 , E Sergi 1 , A Sakkalis 1 , K Ntorlis 1 , A Voulgaridis 1 , M Katsiari 1 , M Laskou 1 , A Kounougeri 1 , C Nikolaou 1 , D Theodoridis 2 , A Alexaki 1 , Z Teneketzi 1 , C Mathas 1 Konstantopouleio General Hospital of Nea Ionia-Patision, Intensive Care Unit, Athens, Greece; 2 Konstantopouleio General Hospital of Nea Ionia-Patision, Hematology Department, Athens, Greece Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P405", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF204": {"text": "Propofol versus hepatic failure: is this correlation true?

However, its epidemiology in the acute stroke setting is not well established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for the development of delirium in acute stroke patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of acute stroke patients consecutively admitted to our stroke care unit from July 2018 to October 2018. The diagnosis of delirium was based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Patients with an ICDSC score of 4 or higher were considered delirious, and those with a score of 3 or less were not. Baseline demographics, information regarding preadmission risk factors for delirium and clinico-radiological profiles were compared between patients with and without delirium. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the associated risk factors. Results: Among the 131 patients assessed, 44 (34%) patients presented with delirium. Patients with delirium were older (84 vs. 71 years, p <0.01) and had higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (9 vs. 2, p <0.01) on admission. Risk of delirium was independently associated with a history of dementia (odds ratio [OR], 4.27; 95% confidential interval [CI], 1.17-16.58; p = 0.030) and hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.10-12.55; p = 0.035). Conclusions: Delirium was observed in one-third of patients admitted with an acute stroke. Older age, higher NIHSS score, dementia and hemorrhagic stroke were predictors of delirium.

During after-hours care level of staffing and the availability of diagnostic resources is lower. We therefore aimed to assess whether in-hospital mortality rates differ between after-hour and routine-hour admission in patients with sepsis. Methods: We analyzed all acute care admissions for the main diagnosis of sepsis in Switzerland between 2006 and 2016 using administrative data. As a primary outcome we compared in-hospital mortality among septic patients admitted during routine-hours (8 am to 8 pm) with those admitted during after-hours: night (8 pm to 8 am) and weekend. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation rate, and 30-day readmission rate. Results: In total, we included 86`597 hospitalizations, 60% during routine-hours, 23% at night, and 17% on weekends. Compared with routine-hour admissions, multivariate analyses revealed a higher risk for in-hospital mortality in patients admitted on weekends (Odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.10), but lower risk in patients admitted at night (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97). Adjusted risks for ICU admissions and intubation rates were higher during nightshifts (ICU: OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.23-1.32; intubation: OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36) and during weekends (ICU: OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.19; intubation: OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25) in comparison with routine-hour admissions. 30-day readmission rates did not differ between routine-and after-hours. Results also showed variations in clinical outcomes between different regions in Switzerland.Conclusions: For patients with sepsis, admission on weekends is associated with higher in-hospital mortality, increased ICU admission and intubation rates. Whether our results are related to differences in staffing and lower access to care remains to be investigated.Introduction: Medication errors are estimated to account for 78% of all medical errors in intensive care, with an average of 1.7 incidents per patient per day", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF210": {"text": "abstract P420).

The objective of this work is to describe the incidence of clinical and non-clinical events during in-hospital transport of critical patients and to analyze the associated risk factors Methods: A cohort study with retrospective collection, from October 2016 to October 2017, which analyzed all intrahospital transports for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in a large hospital, and evaluated the adverse events and related risk factors. Results: In the period, 1559 intrahospital transports were performed in 1348 patients, with a mean age of 66 \u00b1 17 years, with mean transport time of 43 \u00b1 34 minutes. 19.8% of patients were on vasoactive drugs; 13.7% in sedatives and 10.6% in mechanical ventilation. Clinical events occurred in 117 transports (7.5%) and non-clinical in 125 transports (8.0%). Communication failures were prevalent, however, by applying multivariate analysis, the use of sedatives, noradrenaline, nitroprusside and time of transport were associated with clinical adverse events. Use of dobutamine and transport time have been associated with non-clinical events. At the end of transport, 98.1% of the patients presented clinical conditions unchanged in relation to their baseline state. Conclusions: Intrahospital transport is related to a high incidence of adverse events, and the time of transport and use of sedatives and vasoactive drugs have been related to these events.P422Lessons learnt implementing a business continuity plan in critical care, during an informatics system downtime in a Central London teaching hospital T Lalmahomed, R West, F Master, R Mehta, R Sloss, S Shah, P Hopkins Kings College Hospital, Critical Care, London, United Kingdom Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P422", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF211": {"text": "[1]  Nelson N.

The readmission rate varies between 4-6% and mortality between 4-7% (REF). The objective is To evaluate the early readmission rate and the main associated characteristics in Neurological ICU in the 4 year period, from 2014 to 2018 Methods: A review of all early readmissions (<48 hours) was carried out in the period from 2014 to 2018, using a database of the hospital management system and evaluated compliance with the ICU discharge criteria according to the ICU discharge protocol and its correlation with readmission. Results: In the analyzed period, 9,319 patients were admitted to the ICU, of which 25 were readmitted (0.32%), 7 in 2017, 7 in 2015, 4 in 2016, 2 in 2017 and 5 in 2018. The reasons for rehospitalization were lowering the level of respiratory failure, convulsive crisis, acute pulmonary edema, hyponatremia, sudden motor deficit and cardiac arrhythmia. Of the 25 patients, only 1 (4%) did not present criteria according to the ICU discharge protocol. Patients who were readmitted had an increase in their length of stay in the ICU (8.4 days x 5.6 days), and there was no correlation with increased mortality in the sample. Mean age was 68.7 years. Occupancy rate was 88.14%. SAP3 average was 43.4. Mean SOFA on admission was 2.28. 39.57% of the patients were surgical. Conclusions: Despite the high complexity, there is a low rate of early readmissions in the unit.

The inability or delayed ability of IMGs to adapt to their new training environment and professional roles at the beginning of their ICU fellowship may compromise trainee education and patient care[1]. We explored how the composition and processes of the interdisciplinary ICU team affects this transition. Methods: We conducted a qualitative single centered study based on 23 individual interviews with 16 IMG fellows enrolled in the Adult Critical Care Fellowship Program at the University of Toronto. Fellow's perceptions of their role and transition within the interdisciplinary ICU team were explored. We used a constructivist grounded theory approach based on purposive and theoretical sampling, inductive thematic coding, and constant comparison to build an iterative, interdisciplinary theoretical understanding of IMG fellows' transition into ICU teams. Results: Our analysis revealed two main challenges related to the interdisciplinary team: 1) the preponderant role of different team members (e.g. nurses and respiratory therapists), and, 2) the elaborated orchestration of rounds. Early in their fellowship, IMGs had a limited understanding of their role within the interdisciplinary team. As a result, fellows reported experiencing many professional losses regarding their skills, autonomy, appreciation, efficiency, and personal work standards. Combined, these losses threatened fellows' self-confidence. IMGs negotiated this period by relying on various strategies: trusting honed clinical skills, building trust with certain team members, changing own attitudes towards teamwork, or seeking social support. Conclusions: The interdisciplinary ICU team plays an important role in IMG fellows' transition and the unique composition and processes of the ICU team are instrumental in the dynamic process of collapse and re-construction of IMG fellows professional identity early in their fellowship.Discharge decision ICU: what is the role of situation awareness?

Although older patients have a poorer prognosis than younger patients, little is known about the use of resources in this population. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome and intensity of treatment of youngest patients (18-79 years old) versus oldest (\u226580 years old). Methods: Patients from 6 mixed Uruguayan ICUs were included. ICUs demographic data, SAPS 3 score, resource utlization, clinical and outcome data were retrieved from an electronic ICU quality registry (Epimed Monitor System). Severity was evaluated by using SAPS III leaving out age points. Results: We analyse 4020 patients, of them 11.5% (464) were older than 80 years old. Older population had a higher SAPS III leaving out age points [ 30 (18.25-44) vs 25 (13-39), p<0.001] and a worse ICU mortality (29% vs 17.8%, p<0.001). Despite respiratory failure in the first 24 hours was equal in both groups (28% in more than 80 years old vs 24% in youngers, p=0.11), invasive mechanical ventlation was less used in the elderly population (37 vs 41%%, p=0.01).

There is little knowledge on the effects of structural hospital characteristics on mortality. Methods: Patients with severe sepsis were identified in German national claims data. Based on a previously reported model[1]  risk-and reliability adjusted mortality (RSMR) per hospital was calculated. RSMR were linked to structural characteristics of hospitals obtained from legally obliged quality reports. The relationship between structural characteristics and presence of an RSMR above the national average was analyzed in logistic regressions. A backward selection was used to identify most relevant predictors. Results: 134.000 cases from 1276 hospitals were used to calculate the RSMR per hospital. Observed hospital mortality was 42%. Median RSMR was 42% [IQR: 38%-47%]. In univariate analysis a RSMR above national average was predicted by academic teaching status of the hospital, having a higher number of beds, a higher number of cases per bed, and a higher number of specialized technical equipment (all p < 0.01). Hospitals owned by non-profit organizations showed higher mortality compared to private or state owned hospitals (p < 0.001). After backward selection of predictors only number of specialized equipment (OR=1.07 [CI 1.04, 2], p < 0.001) and ownership (private: OR=0.57 [0.42, 0.78], state: OR=0.6 [0.45, 0.82], p < 0.001) remained in the model. Conclusions: Hospitals of the highest levels of careindicated by number of technical equipmentmight be disadvantaged in current risk-adjustment models based on individual patient claims data. Structural characteristics might be needed to be included in riskmodeling. Whether hospitals owned by non-profit organizations have quality issues or different coding strategies in claims data needs further investigation.[1] Schwarzkopf D et al.

The number of patients living with cancer has been increasing. ICU admission may be required for management of acute illnesses associated with the underlying malignancy or complications of therapy. Methods: Retrospective study of 99 oncologic patients admitted to the ICU between January and December of 2016. Results: Of the 638 patients admitted to the ICU in 12 months, 99 (15.5%) had cancer: 70 (70.7%) solid tumors and 29 (29.3%) hematological cancer. SAPS II score was 50.5\u00b117.6 in solid and 45.9 \u00b117.5 in hematological tumors patients. Twenty-two (81,5%) patients with hematological malignancies were admitted due to medical complications, the majority (18; 66.7%) directly related with cancer or cancer treatment. On the contrary, in solid tumors, surgical pathology was the main cause of ICU admission: 56 (77.8%) cases, being 31 (55.4%) complications of cancer related elective surgery, 20 (35.7%) urgent surgery related to the tumor and 5 (8.9%) urgent surgery unrelated to cancer. Oncologic patients had higher ICU mortality rate (39.4%) when compared with non-cancer population (29.6%). Hematological patients had 63% of ICU mortality rate and solid tumor 30.6%. Conclusions: Solid tumors patients are more likely to be a surgical admission and hematological patient are at higher risk of a medical Table 1 (abstract P458).

Does frailty score at intensive care unit admission affect mortality at one year? A retrospective observational cohort study D Hewitt, M Booth Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Intensive Care Unit, Glasgow, United Kingdom Critical Care 2019, 23(Suppl 2):P461Introduction: This study primarily aimed to investigate frailty\u00b4s impact on mortality, 1 year after ICU admission. Frailty is a syndrome characterised by decreased reserve and greater vulnerability. Consequently, we hypothesised that frail patients would exhibit decreased survival compared to non-frail patients. If true, frailty scoring[1]   could increase predictive accuracy of current scoring systems and facilitate better informed decisions. To validate this, the relationship between frailty score and outcomes must be tested extensively.Methods: This single-centre retrospective observational cohort study examined prospectively collected clinical data from 400 critically ill patients. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale[1]  (CFS) and defined as CFS \u22655. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses tested the relationships of frailty, covariates and outcomes. Results: Of 400 eligible patients, 111 (27.8%) were frail and 289 (72.3%) were non-frail. Frail patients were older (62 vs 56, p<0.001) and had higher APACHE-II scores (22 vs 19, p<0.001). Females were more likely to be frail than males (34.1% vs 22.9% frail, p=0.018) (Table 1).

Methods: Single-centre randomized controlled trial on patients presenting with cardiogenic APO. Primary endpoint was a heart rate reduction.Secondary endpoints included: improvement in subjective dyspnoea scales, respiratory rate, blood oxygenation, intubation rate and 28 days mortality rate. Results: 188 patients were enrolled and randomized (94 patients to hCPAP; 94 to HFNC) ( 89 to 271.83\u00b173.63). Intubation rate was lower in hCPAP (6.9% for hCPAP versus 10.48% for HFNC) and 28 days mortality rate is lower in hCPAP (9.6% for hCPAP versus 14.9% for HFNC). Conclusions: Both hCPAP and HFNC significantly improved patient condition in patient presenting to the ED with cardiogenic APO.

Furthermore we wanted to test the interpersonal variation of the Nu-DESC. Delirium is proved to be associated with increased mortality [1] . Nu-DESC is an observational five-item scale that does not require patient participation and is adapted to the fluctuating nature of delirium. Each item can be scored from 0 to 2. Delirium is defined with a score > 2. The Nu-DESC has recently been translated into Danish (Nu-DESC DK) but has not been validated.Methods: ICU patients, who met the inclusion-criteria for the CAM-ICU were scored with both CAM-ICU and Nu-DESC DK. Patients were scored of two independent nurses at approximately the same time every day.Results: A total of 24 patients were enrolled, and 54 comparisons between CAM-ICU and Nu-DESC DK were registered ( Figure 1 ).There was agreement between Nu-DESC and CAM-ICU in 46 of registrations (hereof 44 registrations were delirium negative). In interpersonal variation, 14 registrations were made. The conclusion was identical in 86% of registrations, but only 57% agreed in all 5 scoring-scale items (all negative).Conclusions: A high agreement between Nu-DESC and CAM-ICU was found however the comparison was based on predominately patients with negative delirium score. The interpersonal variation of Nu-DESC scoring was substantial. A future validation of the Nu-DESC DK as a screening tool in the ICU requires thorough training and instructions to minimize interpersonal variation. Introduction: An increasing number of patients are being discharged directly home from critical care units and this is currently viewed as a negative quality indicator [1] . The purpose of this audit was to characterise a cohort of patients who can be safely discharged directly home from adult critical care at St Thomas\u00b4Hospital (STH). Methods: Retrospective observational study of two groups of patients; 1) those discharged directly home from critical care, 2) those discharged within two days of step down to a ward from critical care (admissions 1st June-31st October 2017). The clinical notes of these patients were reviewed via online systems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 96, "end": 99, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1498, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2975, "end": 2978, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2130, "end": 2138, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "Results: Baseline demographics of the 58 patients in Group 1 and 90 patients in Group 2 were similar (mean age of 51 years, versus 46 years, p=0.34); average length of stay in critical care was also similar (2.9 days versus 2.5 days respectively p= 0.72). In Group 1, 24 of 168 ICU days were after considered fit for step down versus 40 of 222 days in Group 2, p=0.32 (Fig 1, 2) . In Group 1, drug related presentations were more common (27% versus 13% p=0.03), fewer patients had specialist follow up post discharge (36% versus 87%, p<0.001). In Group 1, 7 patients (12%) were readmitted within 28 days, 3 to critical care. In Group 2, 7 patients (8%) were readmitted, 1 to critical care (p=0.38 and 0.14 respectively); none of these readmissions were felt to have been preventable.Conclusions: There is a cohort of patients suitable for discharge directly home from critical care who did not spend significantly longer in ICU awaiting discharge than those who were stepped down to the ward. Identifying these patients early, potentially by their diagnosis, and creating a pathway including access to specialist follow up clinic could allow prompt discharge directly from critical care, thus improving patient satisfaction and reducing hospital-acquired morbidity healthcare costs [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 368, "end": 378, "text": "(Fig 1, 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "P426"}, {"text": "The evaluation of the usability of a critical care information system ( Introduction: Critical Care Information Systems (CCIS) support clinical processes by storing and managing data, but poor usability can lead to staff dissatisfaction and increased workload, promoting workarounds that may compromise patient safety [1] .

Methods: A prospective, mixed method observational study conducted in May 2018, comprising of (1) an audit assessing the ease of linking bedside devices to ICCA, (2) an audit assessing the usability of co-signing medications in ICCA compared with a non-ICCA paper Factors that commonly drive workforce metrics may not correlate with staff perceptions of safety. The BPR is a pragmatic, staff driven, tool to augment other measures of safety and is applicable to various ICU settings. Further research is needed to explore staff perceptions in order to understand the importance of this organisationally, and for staff stress.

Conclusions: Electronic checklist in ward rounds can increase the rate of DVT prophylaxis and reduce the duration, but it cannot improve the prognosis of critically ill patients. Introduction: The goal of the project \"I See You\" is family-centeredcare based on family meetings that improve the experience of the patient\u00b4s family members during hospitalization in the ICU. The meetings focus on relaying information, raising knowledge and addressing the social and emotional needs of families. Providing support along with information was found to be the strongest predictor of family satisfaction and could lead to improve cooperation between family and staff [1] .Methods: Meetings and questionnaire: Family meetings consist of a multidisciplinary team, a group facilitator and combined with a multimedia presentation about the unit and equipment. In addition, they focus on social and emotional needs: managing daily routine, sharing problems, fears and anxieties and more. At the end of the session a questionnaire was given to assess the impact of the intervention. Sharing Data: At the end of the first quarter, the data from meeting was summarized and sent to the staff alongside tools for effective communication.Results: The project began in February 2018. To date, 162 family members of 74 patients have attended the sessions. The topics discussed by the participants include: contact with the patient, prevention of infections, Procedures, visits, conversations with doctors, medical confidentiality; Guardianship; tracheotomy and Social issues (Fig 1) . A sample of questionnaires was transferred to 57 participants report satisfaction at a very high level.Conclusions: The meeting received a very positive feedback from the participants. The project has achieved its goals and therefore it has been decided to be continued.Introduction: POSSUM score and Boyd criteria are used to predict the outcome for high risk surgical patients. The aim of this study was to validation of these two measurement tools on mortality and morbidity in a University-based surgical intensive care unit (SICU) in Thailand.Methods: Nine hundred and fifty two patients were enrolled onto this prospective review. All patients who had been admitted to SICU in a University-based hospital were included. All patients were collected for Boyd criteria and POSSUM score and outcomes and morbidity during SICU admission and discharge. Introduction: Aromatic microbial metabolites (AMM), such as phenyllactic (PhLA), p-hydroxyphenylacetic (p-HPhAA), and phydroxyphenyllactic (p-HPhLA) are involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock and are associated with mortality [1] . According to previous studies, AMM have a high prognostic value in patients with abdominal infection [2, 3] . We hypothesize that AMM have the prognostic value in patients with pneumonia in ICU.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 318, "end": 321, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2901, "end": 2904, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4891, "end": 4894, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4998, "end": 5001, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5002, "end": 5004, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 70, "end": 71, "text": "(", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1841, "text": "Table  1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2238, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3796, "end": 3803, "text": "(Fig 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "P431"}, {"text": "Methods: Data of patients with community-acquired pneumonia was obtained on admission to ICU. The levels of AMM (PhLA, p-HPhLA and p-HPhAA) were measured in blood serum using gas chromatography with flame ionization detector and compared in 2 groups of patients: with favorable and with lethal outcome (Mann-Whitney Utest). Spearman's correlations between AMM and clinical and laboratory data were calculated. Using method of logistic regression and ROC analysis, we measured the prognostic value of AMM. (Table 1) . It was revealed, that some AMM have similar prognostic characteristics in comparison with SOFA and CURB-65 scales; high level of AMM is associated with high risk of death (ROC-analysis - Fig. 1) .Conclusions: Serum concentrations of AMM can be used as independent and practical criteria for the assessing of prognosis in patients with infection in ICU. Introduction: Frailty in the critically ill is associated with increased morbidity and mortality but the optimal timing of frailty assessment, how to best measure frailty, reasons for adverse outcomes and how critical illness impacts frailty are unknown [1] . In preparation for a multi-center study designed to address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a pilot study whose aim was to assess feasibility as determined by recruitment rates, ability to assess frailty at ICU admission and hospital discharge, ability to measure ICU and hospital processes of care and ability to conduct 6-month assessments. Conclusions: A multi-center study is feasible but follow-up losses due to mortality and inability to return for assessment will require sample size adjustment. Frailty characterization is method dependent, can be done on hospital discharge but varies with time of assessment. These findings will need to be confirmed in our larger study currently in progress. Introduction: Given the ageing of the world\u00b4s population, the demands of critical care resources for elderly patients has increased during the past decade. However, little is known about quality of life and outcomes of elderly ICU survivors. The aim of the study is to assess outcomes of elderly ICU survivors at least 6 months after discharge: quality of life and mortality. Methods: It is a retrospective study performed in a medical adult ICU between January 2016 to December 2017. The study included all elderly survivors ( \u226565 years) after ICU admission. Outcomes were assessed by telephone interviews at least 6 months after ICU discharge. The primary outcome was assessing the quality of life after ICU stay, measured by Euro Qol 5D questionnaire. The EQ-5D descriptive system contains five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression). For each dimension, there are five levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and unable to/extreme problems Figure 1 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1124, "end": 1127, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 514, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 704, "end": 711, "text": "Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2874, "end": 2882, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Most elderly survivors patients showed a good health related quality of life using the EuroQoL 5D-5L after ICU discharge. Fig. 1 (abstract P468) . Quality of life (EuroQoL 5D) scores after ICU discharge Introduction: Sepsis survivors face mental and physical sequelae even years after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). Effects of a primary care management intervention in sepsis aftercare were tested. Exploratory analyses suggest better functional outcomes within the intervention group compared to the control group at six and 12 months after ICU discharge. Longer term effects of the intervention have not been reported. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted, enrolling 291 patients who survived sepsis (including septic shock), recruited from nine German ICUs. Participants were randomized to usual care (n=143) or to a 12-months intervention (n=148). The intervention included training of patients and their primary care physicians (PCP) in evidence-based post-sepsis care, case management provided by trained nurses and clinical decision support for PCPs by consulting physicians. Usual care was provided by PCPs in the control group. The primary outcome of the trial was the change in mental healthrelated quality at 6-months after ICU discharge. Secondary outcomes included measures of mental and physical health. Data were collected by telephone interviews using validated questionnaires at the 24-months follow-up (12 months after the 1-year intervention).Results: 186 [63.9%, 98 intervention, 88 control] of 291 patients completed the 24-months follow-up. Unlike the intervention group, the control group showed a significant increase of posttraumatic symptoms (diff. PTSS-10 to baseline, mean (SD) 3.7(11.8) control vs.-0.7(12.1) intervention; p=0.016). There were no significant differences in the MCS and all other secondary outcomes between intervention and control group.Introduction: Survivors of sepsis often show symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Only few studies report on courses of more than 12 month after discharge from the ICU. The aim of this study was to identify predictors for changes in PTSD symptoms over time up to 24 month. Methods: Follow-up data of the SMOOTH triala RCT to evaluate a primary care management intervention on sepsis survivorswere analyzed. Included patients were surveyed by phone for PTSDsymptoms at one, 6, 12 and 24 months after discharge from ICU using the Post-Traumatic-Stress-Scale (PTSS-10). Scores changes between follow-up periods were analyzed using latent-change scores in structural equation models. Predictors were clinical and sociodemographic baseline characteristics as well as physical, cognitive and functional sepsis sequelae assessed by validated questionnaires.Results: 291 patients were included of which 186 participated in the 24 month follow-up. A decrease of PTSD symptoms between 6 and 12 months was predicted by higher education (B=-0.32, p=0.04), while higher pain intensity at one month predicted an increase (B=0.01, p=0.041). Increasing PTSD symptoms between 12 and 24 months were predicted by reporting more than two traumatic memories at one month (B=0.44, p=0.004), more sleep problems (B=0.22, p=0.08) and worse cognitive performance at 6 months (B=-0.03, p=0.043) as well as more neuropathic symptoms at 12 months (B=0.04, p=0.015).Conclusions: Sepsis patients that suffer from physical, cognitive and functional impairments after ICU discharge may be at increased risk for developing late-onset PTSD.

If those approaches are unappropriate and the needs are not met, patients' death process may be burdensome for caregivers. This could affect the quality of care for patients and families during the whole end-of-life care process. The aim of our study was to explore the different needs and coping strategies used by ICU healthcare providers when facing patients in the dying process. Methods: Qualitative and collective case study. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted in ICU personnel (3 physicians and 7 nursing professionals). A thematic analysis was done using NVivo 11 software. Local Ethics Committee approved the study. Results: Respondents were 70% women, had 36.7 \u00b1 8.2 years-old and 11.1 \u00b1 8.2 years of ICU experience. Main needs identified in ICU healthcare providers refer to a lack of tools for doing emotional containment when delivering bad news to families, handling personal mourning, the need to perceive consistency regarding end-of-life care management across the ICU team, and a wish of having regular training from a psychologist. Main identified coping strategies included closing rituals, finding quiet spaces to spend time, and asking for counselling with more expert colleagues. A need for systematic, although basic training on these issues from qualified professionals is demanded. Conclusions: Usually, basic needs from patients and families in the process of dying are well addressed, but healthcare providers' needs are underrecognized and coping strategies mostly unknown. Visibilization of those needs and basic but formal training in emotional containment, self-care and coping strategies are greatly desired. Introduction: In the intensive care unit (ICU), patients often exhibit cognitive impairments that prevent them from participating in decisions related to therapeutic options at the end of life. Consequently, their families are often asked to speak for them when difficult decisions must be made. The main of this study was to determine the frequence in wich family want to share in end of life decisions and factors associated with this desire.Methods: A prospective study was conducted in one mixed ICU in Montevideo. Relatives of Patients were invited to participate in this study after 72 hours in the ICU and completed a survey that included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: We analized 135 relatives from 96 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The relationship with the patient was as follows: 23% spouses, 23% siblings, 21% grown children, 14% parents, and 19% other family members and friends. Of them, 41.5% reported a desire to share in end of life decisions. Anxiety and depression symtoms were present in 60% and 41% respectively. Factors asociated with the desire of involvment in end of life decisions by bivariate analysis were: female sex (48% vs 29%, p=0.03), presence of anxiety (51% vs 28%, p=0.008) and patient ECOG 2-4 (70% vs 34%, p=0.05). Multivariate analysis shows that the presence of anxiety is the only independent factor associated with the desire to participate in end of life decisions (OR 2.20, IC 95% 1.02-4.73; p=0.04). Conclusions: Have a loved one in ICU is often associated with Anxiety and Depression after 72 hours of admission. Only 41% of the relatives want to participate in end of life decisions. The presence of anxiety is independently associated with the want to share in decisions making process. Introduction: Intensive care aims to treat failure of vital organ systems. Sometimes, a patient's condition is of such a degree that intensive care is no longer beneficial, and decisions to withdraw or withhold intensive care are made. This means that life-sustaining treatments are terminated or not initiated. We aimed to identify variables that are independent factors for the decision to withdraw or withhold intensive care. Methods: Registry study using extracted data from a national quality registry the Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR) 2014-2016. Data are delivered to the registry by nurses and doctors daily, during each patients' stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 97,095 intensive care cases reported to the SIR from 2014-2016. Results: Data regarding each patient\u00b4s age, sex, diagnoses, condition at admission (expressed as Simplified Acute Physiology Score version 3, SAPS 3), comorbidities and registered decisions to withdraw or withhold intensive care were analyzed. Of the 97,095 cases reported, 41.9% were women and 58.1% men, and 47.1% were 61-80 years old. A total of 15.4% received a decision to withdraw or withhold intensive care, accounting for 16.2% of all women and 14.8 % of all men, p<0.001. Independent variables associated with increased odds of receiving a decision to withdraw or withhold intensive care were older age, worse condition at admission, and female sex. Female sex was associated with an increased odds of receiving a decision to withdraw or withhold intensive care by 18% (CI 13.4-23.0%) after adjustments for condition at admission and age. Conclusions: Older age, worse condition at admission and female sex was found to be independent variables associated with an increased odds to receive a decision to withdraw or withhold intensive care.Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P482"}]}
