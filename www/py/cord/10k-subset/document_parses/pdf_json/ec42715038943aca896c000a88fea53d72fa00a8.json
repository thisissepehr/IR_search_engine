We hypothesized that psoas:lumbar vertebral index (PLVI), a measure of central sarcopenia, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients. Methods A query of our institutional trauma registry from 2005 to 2010 was performed. Data was collected prospectively for the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study (PTOS). Inclusion criteria: age [55 years, ISS [15, and ICU LOS [48 h. Using admission CT scans, psoas:vertebral index was computed as the ratio between the mean cross-sectional areas of the psoas muscles and the L4 vertebral body at the level of the L4 pedicles. The 50th percentile of the psoas:L4 vertebral index value was determined, and patients were grouped into high ([0.84) and low (B0.83) categories based on their relation to the cohort median. Primary endpoints were mortality and morbidity (as a combined endpoint for PTOS-defined complications). Univariate logistic regression was used to test the association between patient factors and mortality. Factors found to be associated with mortality at p \\ 0.1 were entered into a multivariable model. Results A total of 180 patients met the study criteria. Median age was 74 years (IQR 63-82), median ISS was 24 (IQR 18-29). Patients were 58 % male and 66 % Caucasian. Mean PLVI was 0.86 (SD 0.25) and was higher in male patients than female patients (0.91 \u00b1 0.26 vs. 0.77 \u00b1 0.21, p \\ 0.001). PLVI was not associated with mortality in univariate or multivariable modeling. After controlling for comorbidities, ISS, and admission SBP, low PLVI was found to be strongly associated with morbidity (OR 4.91, 95 % CI 2.28-10.60).

Recently, attention has been focused on the concept of frailty as a driver of outcomes across a wide range of disease states in the elderly, including chronic kidney disease, malignancy, and aortic valve disease [5] [6] [7] . The original description of frailty includes difficulty with activities of daily living, reduced speed of ambulation, subjective feelings of exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, and weakness as measured by grip strength [8] . The association of frailty with outcomes after trauma is not well characterized, perhaps in part because frailty evaluation using conventional metrics in the trauma population is not practicable. Trauma is by its nature unpredictable, and for this reason most injured patients will present without baseline measurements of frailty. Attempts to measure frailty after injury using conventional metrics may be limited by altered mental status or inability to participate in physical activity. An attractive solution to this problem is to measure a surrogate for frailty that does not rely upon active patient participation, such as radiographically determined central sarcopenia [9] .

Study inclusion criteria were age C55 years, severe injury (Injury Severity Score (ISS) [15) , and ICU length of stay [48 h. Patients were excluded if they suffered a critical head injury (defined as a Head/Neck Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score C5), did not receive admission cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen, had fractures or preexisting hardware of the 4th lumbar vertebral body, or had a retroperitoneal hematoma that distorted the cross-sectional area of the psoas at the level of the L4 vertebral body.

Since imaging occurs extremely early in the hospital course of trauma patient, admission PLVI is unlikely to be greatly affected by injuries, interventions undertaken to treat injuries, or complications developing thereafter. The admission PLVI can therefore be thought of as a baseline ''snapshot'' that represents the patient's condition at the time of injury.

Given that the predicted mortality in this range of ISS for patients greater than 55 years of age would be expected to be between *5 and 13 %, it is not entirely surprising, considering the relatively small sample size, that no difference is seen in our model.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the subgroup analysis, the only category of complications to reach statistical significance between the two groups was infectious complications. Frailty has been associated with alterations in both the innate and adaptive immune system [18] [19] [20] , and it is thus possible that in the presence of frailty as reflected by low PLVI, host immune responses may be compromised. Alternatively, it may be that the frailty phenotype necessitates interventions which result in increased risk of infections. For instance, patients who are unable to be mobilized from bed may be subjected to prolonged use of indwelling urinary catheters, resulting in increased risk of urinary tract infection. Despite our findings, this study has some important limitations. The utility of using ''any complication'' as a combined primary endpoint may be questioned, as different complications have different risk factors which may not be equally distributed between our two groups. Given our relatively small sample size and the degree of complexity that would be introduced in order to control for all of the risk factors for each individual complication, we have chosen to look at an aggregate measure instead. However, the use of morbidity as a combined endpoint may be more meaningful than rates of specific complications, as the aggregate reflects the overall baseline condition and host response to trauma. Additionally, as no specific treatments are available to protect frail patients from posttraumatic morbidity, the therapeutic benefit of a frailty index is currently very limited. However, the addition of central sarcopenia to the traditional predictors of outcome may help inform clinicians when discussing likely outcomes with family patients and their families. Future prospective studies may identify specific opportunities for improvement in this cohort. Finally, this study represents a singleinstitution experience with a limited number of patients, and as such may not be applicable to other centers.
