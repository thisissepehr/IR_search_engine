[20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes were 19F, 19A, 23F, 4, 6A and 6B, which is in agreement with the most common serotypes observed globally. 30 Indeed, 19F was previously documented as the most frequent serotype in AOM episodes in South Africa. 28 The presence of vaccine serotypes in vaccinated and unvaccinated children reflects the low coverage of PCV in this population due to the early period of 7-valent PCV (Prevnar/Prevenar, Pfizer/Wyeth, New York, NY; PCV7) introduction. In South Africa, PCV7 has been available since April 2009 through the public national immunization program to an estimated birth cohort of 1.2 million children, where 3 doses of PCV7 are administered to children at 6, 14 weeks and 9 months. 31 Other PCVs available in the private market are 10-valent PCV (Synflorix, GlaxoSmithKline, Belgium; PHiD-CV) and 13-valent PCV (Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, Pfizer/Wyeth, USA; PCV13) licensed in 2008 and 2009, respectively. 32 In our study, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 16% of all AOM episodes.

[33] [34] [35] [36] The majority (88%) of the Staphylococcus aureus episodes in our study were identified from tympanocentesis samples. However, as we did not systematically evaluate for response to empiric treatment which would not necessarily have optimally covered for Staphylococcus aureus, 37 we were unable to determine whether identification of Staphylococcus aureus in this setting was truly causative or reflected contamination from the auditory canal.

The resistance of S. pneumoniae serotype 19A to penicillin was mainly intermediate, thereby highlighting the lack of resistance from this usually penicillin-resistant serotype. 39 These findings are consistent with recent reports from other countries, 23, 24 and underscore the observed change in antibiotic resistance to penicillin over the past decade, particularly because a high percentage of samples were resistant to penicillin in the previous South African study. 28 Similarly, most other vaccine serotypes were also intermediate in their resistant to penicillin. Our study also indicated that NTHi-positive episodes were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (60.8%) and ampicillin (13.9%), consistent with previous reports from South Africa. 24, 28 Furthermore, the low resistance for S. pneumoniae and NTHi to amoxicillin/clavulanate supports its continued use in the treatment of AOM as recommended in South Africa. 37 In addition to antibiotic treatment for AOM, vaccination indicated against AOM may help control the associated disease burden. 40, 41 Because more than 50% of the isolated serotypes in our study were PCV7-serotypes and the non-PCV7-serotypes among unvaccinated children were 3, 5, 6A and 19A in conjunction to the burden of NTHi, it may be useful to consider the potential value of PCVs in their protection against AOM in South Africa. A study in Finland between 2006 and 2009 found respiratory viruses in 87% of nasopharyngeal samples from children aged 6-36 months with AOM. 42 The prevalence of respiratory viruses was, however, lower in studies from Turkey and Japan. 43, 44 The Turkish study included children 6 months-12 years old and identified respiratory viruses in 32.5% of MEF samples 43 and the Japanese study in children <10 years old detected respiratory viruses in 33% of nasopharyngeal secretions. 44 Possible reasons for the higher detection in our study may be related to differences on site of sample collection (middle ear or nasopharynx), our experimental approach as rRT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional viral diagnostics and detects viral nucleic acids even in the absence of acute illness 11 or that our study included children <5 years who are at greater risk of developing AOM. Another plausible reason for our higher viral detection may be due to the testing of more recently discovered respiratory viruses. [45] [46] [47] [48] hRV was the most common virus (37.7%), which is corroborated by previous reports; 42 in addition, hRV was frequently detected irrespective of HIV status. A retrospective study in the USA between 2002 and 2010 demonstrated temporal associations among RSV, hMPV and influenza in individuals aged <18 years, but showed no association between AOM and hRV or adenovirus. 49 This calls into question the causal role of hRV and adenovirus which tend to recur in their circulation having no seasonal pattern contrary to RSV, hMPV and influenza which are likely to be more seasonal as illustrated by us. Moreover, the uncertainty of specific viruses as etiological agents for recurrent AOM has been suggested in a study that found similar frequency of respiratory viruses in both children with recurrent AOM and healthy children. 50 Viral-bacterial interactions among AOM episodes tend to be associated with more severe AOM. 51 Animal models, tissue culture experiments and population-wide epidemiological studies have suggested interactions between S. pneumoniae and respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of AOM, 52 the most well-known synergistic effect being that of influenza and S. pneumoniae. 53 We detected influenza viruses (A + B) in combination with S. pneumoniae in 8 episodes and RSV and S. pneumoniae in 3 episodes. A high viral RSV load in combination with S. pneumoniae has been associated with an increased risk of AOM, and the same study also showed an increased risk of AOM during co-infections with hBoV and H. influenzae, 54 combination found in 6 episodes in our study.
