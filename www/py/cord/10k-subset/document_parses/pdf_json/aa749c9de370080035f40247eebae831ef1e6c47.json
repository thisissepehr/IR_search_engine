Although the data on endogenous ligands might, in some cases, be confounded by low-level contamination with microbial products 6 , it is clear that this is not always the case. The identification and further characterization of endogenous ligands for TLRs (as well as other PRRs) provides a novel perspective for examining the aetiology of autoimmune disease. Instead of viewing autoimmunity as an overzealous response to host antigens by the adaptive immune system, we must also consider the possibility that, at least in some cases, autoimmunity results from an overzealous response to exogenous or endogenous ligands by the innate immune system. This Review summarizes recent in vitro and in vivo studies that point to an important connection between DNA-and RNA-containing immune complexes, the production of type I interferons (IFNs; that is, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2), the activation of TLRs and subsequent events in the development and/or the progression of systemic autoimmune diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 544, "end": 545, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 405, "end": 414, "text": "(TABLE 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Plasmacytoid DC (pDC) .

It is now known that large amounts of IFN\u03b1 are produced by a relatively rare, but highly efficient, class of immature DCs that were originally known as natural IFN-producing cells but are now more commonly known as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) 14 . In response to viral infection, pDCs produce IFN\u03b1 and therefore have a crucial role in activating the innate immune system. Most importantly, as shown by insightful studies carried out by Lars R\u00f6nnblom and colleagues 15, 16 , immune complexes (isolated from the sera of patients with SLE) can be an unexpectedly potent stimulus for IFN\u03b1 production, especially for pDC populations that have previously been exposed to type I IFNs or other cytokines such as granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In addition, pDCs can be activated by purified patient-derived IgG mixed with either apoptotic-or necrotic-cell debris. Activation of pDCs by these immune complexes is sensitive to both DNase and RNase 17 . Because the apoptotic-and necrotic-cell debris are from mammalian cells, these experiments clearly show that endogenous nucleic acids have a key role in the activation of pDCs. Similar to other APCs, pDCs express receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc\u03b3Rs), which can bind and internalize IgG-containing immune complexes and function as activating receptors (reviewed in REF. 18 ). Immune complexes from patients with SLE cannot stimulate pDCs that have been pretreated with blocking antibodies directed against Fc\u03b3RIIa (a lowaffinity Fc\u03b3R; also known as CD32). Moreover, in this study, heat-aggregated IgG, another ligand of Fc\u03b3RIIa, fails to induce IFN\u03b1 production 19 . Together, these data show that only certain immune complexes have IFN\u03b1inducing activity and that Fc\u03b3RIIa is required for the detection of these complexes. pDCs express TLR7 and TLR9, which detect nucleicacid-containing immune complexes. One reason for the efficient response of pDCs to both microbial infection and SLE-associated immune complexes is that, in addition to other PRRs, pDCs constitutively express two members of the TLR family, TLR7 and TLR9 (REF. 20) .

In individuals who are genetically predisposed to develop SLE, factors that have been associated with the initiation of symptoms and the subsequent disease flares include infectious agents, stress, toxins and physical agents (such as sunlight). Patients present with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Cutaneous lesions are found in 80-90% of patients and include the following: a characteristic rash across the cheeks (also known as a butterfly rash), which recurs; and discoid lesions, which are more chronic. Other symptoms can include one or more of the following: fatigue, painful joints, nephritis, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, pericarditis and pleuritis. Morbidity and mortality are associated with severe renal disease and accelerated atherosclerosis. SLE is considered to be a systemic autoimmune disease because of the prevalence of antibodies that react with self components in the nucleus and cytoplasm, often macromolecular complexes of proteins and nucleic acids. The autoantibodies form immune complexes that can accumulate in the kidneys and other tissues and induce inflammation. Some autoantibodies might also bind directly to epitopes in the kidneys or the central nervous system, with pathological consequences.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Box 1 | Common systemic autoimmune diseases: clinical symptoms and immunological features"}, {"text": "Other examples of chronic inflammatory diseases with an autoimmune aetiology are scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.

Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is most commonly associated with lymphocyte infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands, resulting in dry eyes and a dry mouth; however, lymphocyte infiltration might extend to the skin, lungs, heart, kidneys and nervous system. Both scleroderma and Sj\u00f6gren's disease are frequently associated with the production of antinuclear antibodies. Intriguingly, SLE, scleroderma and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome are each associated with particular autoantibody reactivities: SLE, with antibodies that react with doublestranded DNA, nucleosomes and the protein Sm; scleroderma, with antibodies that react with topoisomerase I, fibrillarin and centromeres; and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, with antibodies that react with the RNA-binding proteins Ro (also known as SSA) and La (also known as SSB).

Chromatin-containing immune complexes (but not endotoxin-free protein-containing immune complexes) induce mouse bone-marrowderived DCs to produce large amounts of tumournecrosis factor, and this response was found to depend on Fc\u03b3R expression (in this case, mouse Fc\u03b3RIII), to be blocked by inhibitors of TLR9 and to be markedly reduced in cells from TLR9-deficient mice 27 . Moreover, DNA-containing immune complexes from the sera of patients with SLE were shown to stimulate the production of cytokine mRNA by HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells that had been transfected with TLR9 and Fc\u03b3RIIa, as well as to colocalize with TLR9 and Fc\u03b3RIIa in acidic lysosomes 28 . The exact compartment in which the immune-complex-Fc\u03b3R and TLR pathways intersect is likely to depend on the cell type, and endosomes might be the more relevant compartment in pDCs 29 . Similar to the way that DNA-containing immune complexes activate cells through TLR9, RNA-containing immune complexes activate cells through TLR7. Sera from patients with SLE or Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome often have high titres of antibodies specific for small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are macromolecular complexes that consist of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and associated proteins. Although it has been difficult to show that these sera activate pDCs directly, IgG purified from the sera of patients with SLE induces IFN\u03b1 production by pDCs if the IgG is mixed with necrotic-cell debris or purified snRNPs. This IFN\u03b1-inducing activity is inhibited by chloroquine or bafilomycin, agents that interfere with the acidification of endosomes and block the activation of TLR7 and TLR9.

Autoantibodies are produced by self-reactive B cells, which most probably constitute a reasonably high percentage (5-20%) of the naive B-cell repertoire in most individuals 35 . Defects in early B-cell tolerance might lead to an even greater percentage of self-reactive B cells in patients who are prone to the development of autoimmune disease 36 .

Autoantigens that are presented by these APCs then stimulate potentially autoreactive T cells, which in turn promote the activation, clonal expansion and differentiation of the reasonably abundant autoreactive B cells. Under the appropriate conditions, these B cells undergo somatic hypermutation of their B-cell receptor (BCR) and switch to expression of pathogenic immunoglobulin classes.

IFN\u03b1 has a broad set of functions. Many of its effects probably contribute to the initiation and the perpetuation of systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and scleroderma. For example, IFN\u03b1 promotes the differentiation of monocytes into myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) that are highly efficient at antigen presentation, that express large amounts of co-stimulatory molecules, MHC class I and class II molecules, and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) proteins, and that produce T-and B-cell survival factors. Mature DCs can then activate autoreactive T helper cells and cytotoxic effector (CD8 + ) T cells. IFN\u03b1 can also contribute to the availability of autoantigen in the following ways: by increasing the sensitivity of target cells to cytotoxic effector mechanisms; by increasing the cytotoxic activity of CD8 + T cells and natural killer cells, through upregulation of expression of granzyme B, CD95 ligand and TRAIL (tumour-necrosis-factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand); and by increasing the expression of common autoantigens, such as Ro and lamin 1b. Direct effects of IFN\u03b1 on B cells include promoting plasmablast and/or plasma-cell differentiation, promoting switching to the pathogenic immunoglobulin isotype IgG2a, and upregulating expression of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88). Importantly, IFN\u03b1 also influences the functional properties of plasmacytoid DCs directly, increasing the expression of IFN-regulatory factor 7 and thereby increasing the responsiveness of plasmacytoid DCs to RNA-and/or DNA-containing immune complexes. The expression of many of the genes that are induced by IFN\u03b1 is higher in patients with SLE, and this gene-expression pattern, as determined by DNA-microarray analysis, is referred to as the IFN signature.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Box 2 | Mechanisms by which interferon-\u03b1 promotes SLE"}, {"text": "by the recognition of virus-infected B cells by T cells 38 . Excessive amounts of cell debris and autoantibodies subsequently form immune complexes, which then induce a second phase of pDC activation (which is TLR dependent) and establish a feedback loop that further exacerbates the disease process. A second possible model links infection to the production of antibodies that react with molecular mimics of autoantigens: that is, viral epitopes that crossreact with autoantigens. One of the main examples of this is the crossreactivity between peptides derived from Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and peptides derived from the autoantigens Ro (also known as SSA) and Sm, which are proteins that are associated with RNA-containing macromolecules 39 . In this model, B cells that respond to EBNA1 epitopes also recognize the corresponding autoantigens. Macromolecules (or apoptotic-and/or necrotic-cell debris) that contain these autoantigens are taken up by either activated B cells (through the BCR) or APCs (through Fc\u03b3R-mediated binding of Ro-or Sm-containing immune complexes). This results in the presentation of a more extensive range of autoantigen epitopes in a milieu that can activate a broader range of autoreactive T cells, eventually leading to the phenomenon of epitope spreading and the activation of B cells that produce a more extensive autoantibody repertoire. However, only 40% of patients with SLE produce Ro-or Sm-specific antibodies, and systemic autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma are associated with autoantibodies specific for other sets of autoantigens that are associated with different subcellular macromolecular particles or organelles (such as nucleoli).

Importantly, IFN\u03b1 markedly upregulates the expression of TLR7 and the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88) in both human B cells 41 and mouse B cells (A.M.R. and T. Behrens, unpublished observations) and can also increase the response of B cells to TLR9 ligands 42 .

One such access route is BCR-mediated endocytosis, and this access route is available not only to microorganisms but also to endogenous ligands that are recognized by an autoreactive BCR. Therefore, self antigens that, when available in excessive quantities, can effectively engage both the BCR and either TLR7 or TLR9 might stimulate autoreactive B cells that are normally quiescent, through inherent adjuvant activity.

Fc\u03b3Rmediated uptake could, in theory, promote delivery to the TLR9-containing compartment of pDCs, and DNA-binding B cells might simply be more prevalent in patients with SLE. It is also possible that synergistic interactions between the BCR (or Fc\u03b3R) and TLR9 increase the weakly stimulatory effects of mammalian DNA 40 . However, the relative inability of immune complexes that consist of hapten-specific antibody and haptenated mammalian genomic DNA to activate B cells effectively compared with immune complexes that consist of hapten-specific antibody bound to hapten ated bacterial DNA indicates that neither of those possibilities is likely to occur 48 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1419, "end": 1421, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug-induced lupus"}, {"text": "Alternatively, the DNA that is present in IFN\u03b1-inducing or B-cell-stimulatory immune complexes could inherently differ from total mammalian DNA, either because patients with SLE have defects in DNA methy lation 54 or because segments of the mammalian genome that are enriched for hypomethylated CpG motifs (such as CpG islands or mitochondrial DNA) are preferentially released by apoptotic or necrotic cells. This possibility is consistent with a report that DNA isolated from immune complexes is enriched for CG content 55 . Notably, therapeutics that are associated with drug-induced lupus are often inhibitors of DNA-methyltransferase 56 .

A similar role for TLR2 and TLR4 was found in studies of mouse models of myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion 104, 105 ; in these studies, mice deficient in TLR2 or TLR4 produced less pro-inflammatory cytokines and developed less severe pathology.

The mice deficient in both TLR2 and TLR4 were also more sensitive to hypoxia-induced lung injury and had a much lower survival rate than did wild-type mice. It seems that low-molecular-weight fragments of hyaluronate, which are released from the extracellular matrix as a result of injury-associated degradation, can provoke inflammatory responses. By contrast, intact (high molecular weight) hyaluronate has a protective effect, which is also mediated through engagement of TLR2 and TLR4 (REF. 106 ).
