Viruses are normally present in very large numbers in the skin lesions of herpes/varicella zoster. Hepatitis virus particles can be detected in the sera of hepatitis carriers or of patients with acute hepatitis.

Sensitivity can be greatly increased by coating with antibody the carbon membrane on the grid.

This 'fly-paper' method increases the sensitivity of particles detected by up to 1000-fold. It works very well for plant viruses (for which it was first developed) and usually works well for enteric viruses in human faeces; but for other mammalian material it has not worked so well, perhaps because mammals make antibodies early in the course of infection and these antibodies adhere to the virus particles and block their adhesion to specific antibody upon the grid.

Fluorescence can be read by the dark-adapted eye without the use of a spectrophotometer. Sensitivity has recently been increased further by using a peroxidase label. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, this catalyses the oxidation of luminol or isoluminol and light is emitted.

The bacteria containing the plasmid can be grown up in great quantity in a medium containing a radioactive label. The radioactive plasmids can then be extracted, the virus DNA fragment cut out of the plasmids with the aid of restriction enzymes and used as a 'probe'. Other methods of making DNA probes are also available. One does not have to use the whole of the nucleic acid; a short nucleotide sequence may be sufficient. This method can also be used for an RNA virus; its RNA can be transcribed to DNA using reverse transcriptase enzyme, and the complementary DNA (cDNA) thus obtained is cloned into a bacterium. The DNA will hybridize with virus RNA in a 'dot-blot' test. This has been used to detect rotavirus double-stranded (ds) RNA in faeces 8 and the sensitivity compares well with that of the ELISA test. For such tests, virus-containing material is broken up to liberate the nucleic acid, usually by treating it with sodium hydroxide. The nucleic acid can then be blotted to give a spot on a nitrocellulose membrane; the labelled DNA probe is then applied. If virus nucleic acid is present in the membrane, the labelled probe attaches to it. The result can be recorded by an autoradiograph. The probe need not be radioactively labelled; it can be labelled using a biotin-avidin link with an enzyme or fluorescein leading to fluorescence or a coloured enzyme product. The method can be used to detect virus nucleic acid in cells that are not making complete virus, as for example to detect Epstein-Barr (EB) virus DNA sequences in Burkitt lymphoma cells or hepatitis B sequences in hepatocytes.

Infection may be severe in the immunesuppressed. 29 Herpes simplex keratitis can usually be recognized clinically and confirmed by virologjcal tests. Stromal keratitis results from invasion of the deeper layers of the cornea with the herpes virus; much of the damage is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction. 30 HSV encephalitis is fortunately rare; about one severe case per million of population per year. 31 The disease is commoner in children than in adults and seems always to be caused by HSV 1. The patient first presents with headache and fever and early malaise. Some patients show early personality changes and about half have fits early in the disease. Headache and fever become worse and the patient goes into coma within a very few days. Localizing signs are often present and indicate a lesion in the temporal lobe on one or other side and most of the signs and symptoms are otherwise caused by cerebral oedema which may be reflected in oedema and swelling of the optic disc. Without treatment, the infection is usually fatal. The differential diagnosis in a child is likely to be a cerebral vein thrombosis, early meningitis or an abscess. In the early stages of the disease, more than 50 cells/cm in the CSF usually points to some other diagnosis; a low sugar level is also likely to indicate a bacterial infection. Workers in the UK and USA used to make a brain biopsy of the temporal lobe to establish a diagnosis beyond doubt before starting treatment. This procedure of itself does not carry a very high risk, but experience has shown that, if treatment is delayed until one is suspicious enough to make a brain biopsy, one has probably waited too long. 31 It is better to attempt to make a retrospective diagnosis by looking for IgM antibodies appearing in the CSF. These antibodies do not appear early but, as the more modern antiviral agents, especially acyclovir, are comparatively non-toxic, one can afford to 'shoot first and ask questions later'. Inevitably, some patients who do not have herpes encephalitis will thus be treated, and they probably will be none the worse for that. It is important, however, to make certain in patients whose symptoms progress that one is not missing tuberculous meningitis or brain abscess or other treatable cause of symptoms.

In tropical countries where malnutrition is rife, distances to hospital are great and transport slow, deaths are numerous, mainly from dehydration.

Animal experiments indicate that much virus replication has usually occurred by the time serious diarrhoea has set in. The damaged cells are replaced within 5-8 days by new cells growing up from the crypts of Lieberkuhn; these new cells are incompletely differentiated and are not attacked by rotaviruses, and so the disease is normally self-limiting. 63 In children suffering from 'combined immunodeficiency syndrome', however, rotavirus diarrhoea and virus excretion may persist for months, and is very difficult to treat. 6 * The best available treatment is to give the child oral rehydration solution by mouth in good time -either the WHO formula, or, as favoured by paediatricians in temperate countries, a solution containing a little less sodium; but both work well.
