The diagnostic criteria have been established by an American-European Consensus Conference [1, 2, 3] . ARDS in children is still associated with a high mortality. Mortality is correlated with the severity of the underlying disease [4, 5] ; however, it is still generally accepted that the degree of hypoxemia predicts outcome [5, 6, 7, 8] . Mortality in children with a PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio lower than 100 in central Europe is still greater than 50% [5] . Another outcome criteria is the aggressiveness of ventilatory support, reflected in the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean airway pressure, and ventilation index [9, 10] .

The significant interactions between treatment and morbidity characteristics (e.g., pneumonia, PaO 2 /FIO 2 <65) indicate that the difference between treatment groups depends on the baseline value of the oxygenation index and on the presence of pneumonia as a causative diagnosis for ARDS. These differences are clearly demonstrated by the median profiles which are displayed separated for the respective subgroups ARDS could be an important therapeutic tool [19, 23, 26] . As early as 1989 it was hypothesized that surfactant could be of therapeutic value not only in premature infant's respiratory distress syndrome but also in ARDS [24] . In that year the first case report of a successfully surfactant-treated child with severe hypoxemic ARDS was published [27] . Surfactant therapy in preterm infants is now based on sound data (e.g., [28, 29, 30] ). In respiratory failure of term infants, in some ways resembling ARDS, a randomized study demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for ECMO [31] . Several uncontrolled studies have been published on adult ARDS [32, 33] ; a large controlled study using small doses of aerosolized synthetic surfactant found no advantage of surfactant [33] , and a smaller administering a bolus reported improved oxygenation and slightly increased survival in the treatment group [34] . In the pediatric population surfactant has been used in several case reports and in small uncontrolled studies of near fatal ARDS [17, 19, 24, 35] . In mild to moderate ARDS (Hallman oxygenation index less than 10) a randomized study demonstrated improved oxygenation immediately after surfactant administration and most ventilation-associated parameters [36] . In patients with severe hypoxemia we observed a short period of improved oxygenation, as in the study by Willson et al. [36] in patients with less severe hypoxemia. The originally planned number of patients, however, could not be recruited in the time period scheduled. This might be due to the fact that the overall incidence of ARDS in children decreased dramatically in central Europe during the study period [13, 37] . The study was stopped as the recruitment dropped in this obviously high mortality group.

The improvement in oxygenation in the control group, which was managed only on a strictly enforced ventilation algorithm and blood pressure and fluid intake protocol, suggests that standardized treatment alone using conventional methods leads to an overall improvement in patient outcome. This is in line with similar findings by Steinhard et al. [12] who reported improved patient outcome simply by introducing enforced ventilatory management protocols.
