According to the WHO definition, lymph nodes involved by NLPHL should have a nodular or nodular and diffuse proliferation of scattered large neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells in a small cell background that reside in expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks; the LP cells must also have a distinct immunophenotypic profile. The LP cells are monoclonal B cells that are typically CD20, BCL6, CD79a, and CD45 positive and are CD30 and CD15 negative. In contrast, the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) are typically positive for CD15 and CD30. However, in CHL, CD20 staining is variable, and CD15 staining may be absent in some cases. Thus, CD30 is often considered to be the most distinctive marker between CHL and NLPHL. In order to better assess CD30 staining in NLPHL, we reviewed 220 cases of NLPHL and found 21 cases that showed at least focal staining of the neoplastic cells for CD30. The CD30 staining was often faint, but occasionally strong, and typically was found only on a subset of the LP cells. We evaluated the clinicopathologic features of these cases to determine whether they showed differences from typical CD30-negative NLPHL and found no significant difference with respect to clinical presentation, histology, other immunophenotypic features or out-come. In summary, we conclude that CD30 expression by LP cells in NLPHL can be seen and should not lead to a misdiagnosis of CHL.

However, this distinction may be difficult in some cases, especially those of the lymphocyte-rich subtype. Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma (LRCHL) was delineated as a specific entity within CHL in the 2008 WHO Classification. In LRCHL, the RS cells have the typical immunophenotype described in CHL. However, these cells reside in a background rich in lymphocytes and often occur in association with small B cell follicles. LRCHL thus bears some histologic similarities to NLPHL; indeed, prior to the widespread use of paraffin section immunostaining in lymphoma diagnosis, many LRCHL were misclassified as NLPHL [16] . Distinction of CHL from NLPHL should be possible by immunophenotyping, in cases which are not morphologically distinct. However, the neoplastic cells in CHL can express CD20 variably, and CD15 staining can be absent in some cases. CD30 would therefore seem to be the most distinctive marker between CHL and NLPHL.

The neoplastic LP cells are typically scattered in small numbers in a background composed of small lymphocytes that consist of a mixture of polytypic B cells and T cells in a nodular pattern. PD1+ T follicular helper cells typically cluster around LP cells. The architecture and the composition of the reactive component sometimes deviate from the classic B cell-rich nodular pattern. Variant patterns include the serpiginous/interconnected nodular pattern, nodular pattern with prominent extranodular LP cells, T cell-rich nodular pattern, diffuse B cell-rich pattern, and diffuse pattern with a T cell-rich background [17] . Among the T cells, the CD4/CD8 ratio is frequently elevated. Flow cytometric analysis frequently discloses a subset of T cells with co-expression of CD4 and CD8 (double positive T cells) without markers of an immature stage of differentiation including TdT and CD1a; this likely represents an unusual reactive or activated T cell population [18] . The differential diagnosis of NLPHL is broad. As LP cells are typically present in small numbers, they may be overlooked, and NLPHL may be misinterpreted as a reactive process. The nodular pattern may suggest follicular lymphoma. If T cells are abundant and the CD4/CD8 ratio is high, the possibility of peripheral T cell lymphoma could be considered. T cells with co-expression of CD4 and CD8 may raise the question of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Rare cases of NLPHL with morphologically atypical T cells can also be mistaken for peripheral T cell lymphoma [19] .

In our experience, we find sclerosis not infrequently in otherwise typical cases of NLPHL and do not believe it is particular to CD30positive NLPHL, and certainly does not exclude a diagnosis of NLPHL. CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported to be associated with c-Jun expression and activation, which is an activator of the activator protein-1 (AP1) transcription factor pathway [23] . AP1 acts as a transcription factor for transforming growth factorbeta which is known to induce fibrosis. Thus, it is possible that the sclerosis seen in the CD30-positive cases may indicate an activated c-Jun pathway.
