Epidemiological data, antimicrobial susceptibility, clinical patterns, underlying illnesses, type of infection, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), number of episodes, coinfection, antimicrobial therapy, and evolution were analyzed. A total of 221 clinical samples from 204 patients were positive for Aeromonas spp. The mean age of the patients was 67.6 years. The main clinical form of presentation was gastrointestinal (78.4%). Malignancy was the main risk group in 69 (33.8%) patients, and 48 (23.5%) were previously healthy. Twenty-one patients (10.3%) were admitted to the ICU. Infections were acquired in the hospital in 52.5% of the patients, and 28.9% were polymicrobial. The overall mortality (after 1 year of follow-up from the first positive culture) was 26.5%. Univariate analysis identified an association between increased mortality and the following variables: age \u226580 years, hospitalization, admission to the ICU, malignancy, extraintestinal infection, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In the multivariate analysis, age \u226580 years [odds ratio (OR), 4.37 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.68-11.35; p = 0.002]], admission to the ICU (OR, 6.59 [95% CI,; p = 0.001]), and malignancy (OR, 3.62 [95% CI, 1.32-9.90; p = 0.012]) were significantly associated with mortality.

Aeromonads are essentially ubiquitous in the microbial biosphere and they can be isolated from virtually every environmental niche where bacterial ecosystems exist, such as aquatic habitats, fish, foods, domesticated pets, birds, and natural soils [1] [2] [3] . The first classifications within the Aeromonas genus have been determined phenotypically (phenospecies), based on growth characteristics and biochemical tests. Nevertheless, there is great difficulty in identifying the different Aeromonas strains on the species level by these characteristics, due to the phenotypical heterogenicity and growing number of known species. One of the biggest steps forward in the taxonomic process has been the introduction and continuous use of genotypical methods (genospecies) [3] [4] [5] [6] . With the use of molecular methods, 96% of the clinical isolates are represented by four species: A. caviae (29.9%), A. dhakensis (25.5%), A. veronii (22.0%), and A. hydrophila (18.0%) [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 353, "end": 356, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 357, "end": 360, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 361, "end": 364, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 877, "end": 880, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 881, "end": 884, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 885, "end": 888, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 889, "end": 892, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1082, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Aeromonas genus microorganisms are known as etiologic agents of a wide spectrum of diseases in humans [2] [3] [4] [7] [8] [9] [10] : gastroenteritis, skin and soft tissue infection, and bacteremia are the most common manifestations.

In our series, 80% of patients had at least one underlying disease, with malignancy and chronic disease being the most common. Interestingly, 22% of patients in our study were previously healthy. In our cohort, gastroenteritis was the most prevalent infection. In several reported studies throughout the world, Aeromonas spp. has been isolated at a rate of 0.6-10% from patients with diarrhea, predominantly from infants and children [3, 7, 8, 11, 18] . In Spain, Aeromonas occupied the fourth place among microbiological causes of all gastrointestinal diseases reported each year during the period from 1997 to 2006 [19] . The high incidence of Aeromonas spp. gastroenteritis in our series of adult patients is not in agreement with data from France and countries of south-east Asia, which reported that Aeromonas-associated diarrhea was the third clinical form of presentation, with 19 and 15%, respectively [9, 20, 21] . This variation may be due to the geographical difference in that south-east of Asia is endemic for Aeromonas, but also other factors may explain these differences, such as dietetic habits, processing method adopted for isolation and identification of Aeromonas species, and the ecology of this microorganism [3, 4, 20, 22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 302, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 307, "end": 310, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 747, "end": 750, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 751, "end": 753, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 754, "end": 756, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 757, "end": 760, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 761, "end": 764, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 930, "end": 934, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1226, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1230, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1234, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1548, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1551, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1555, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1559, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The role of Aeromonas as a gastrointestinal pathogen has been controversial, as 1-4% of asymptomatic individuals carry Aeromonas spp. in their gut [3, 4, 18] . Enterotoxins, cytotoxins, and hemolysins have been studied to elucidate a mechanism by which Aeromonas spp. produce diarrhea, but no convincing causal relationship has been established so far [23] . It is generally assumed that the virulence of Aeromonas is multifactorial and that only a subset of Aeromonas strains can cause gastroenteritis in humans. Moreover, the intestine is a complex ecosystem and in this complex Bhost-enteric pathogen ecosystem,^a variety of both direct and indirect interactions between enteric pathogens, their host, and the circumstances must be taken into account [12, 24, 25] . In the present series, up to 80% of patients with Aeromonas gastroenteritis suffered from severe comorbidities. Therefore, Aeromonas gastrointestinal tract involvement appears to develop in patients predisposed to bowel infection either due to local immune deficiency or by nutritional factors. Unfortunately, we did not explore the pathogenicity and infectivity at a genetic level to establish the role of Aeromonas as an important enteropathogen. The prevalence of coinfection in our series was 14.4% in patients with gastroenteritis, with C. difficile followed by protozoa as the most common pathogens. Thus, it is difficult, in mixed infections, to assess the true contribution of Aeromonas to disease. Bloodstream invasion in patients with gastroenteritis is extremely uncommon and occurs preceding or concurrent with the onset of bacteremia in 9-14% of cases [26] . In our series, no case was recorded, while five patients developed bacteremia in the course of gastroenteritis by other enteropathogens yielded in the same fecal sample. It is possible that Aeromonas requires a huge inoculum into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to spread to the bloodstream. The association of Aeromonas with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is of particular interest [10] . All of the patients with an autoimmune disorder (most of them with IBD) developed acute gastroenteritis as the clinical presentation of infection by Aeromonas. It is well known that Aeromonas has a variety of implications in patients with IBD, as a trigger of the IBD onset or of a relapse, or Aeromonas can cause gastroenteritis without any effect on the IBD course [10] . Remarkable findings among patients with Aeromonas-associated gastroenteritis in our cohort were that 72.5% had been hospitalized and 26.9% of patients received immunosuppressant drugs. In half of the patients with gastroenteritis, the infection was nosocomial. It's possible that Aeromonas-associated diarrhea appeared as a consequence of proliferation and mucosal invasion of patients previously colonized, under aggressive therapies, and with certain comorbidity conditions. Aeromonas has also been implicated as a cause of various extraintestinal manifestations like peritonitis, cholangitis, skin and soft tissue infections, and others [15, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Peritonitis caused by Aeromonas spp. is rare and, in our series, was the second cause of infection, together with cholangitis. In southeast Asia, Aeromonas peritonitis is more prevalent, presenting as secondary peritonitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), or cholangitis.

These epidemiological differences could be a consequence of variations in the ecology of Aeromonas and with differences in the fecal carriage rate of Aeromonas spp. in certain parts of south-east Asia that can be as high as 30%, whereas it is only 3% in Europe [42] . One-third of our cases, however, were healthy, and, among these, there was a predominance of very elderly patients. It has been suggested that contaminated lines, such as catheters, can also serve as a portal of entry to seed blood-borne infection [41] . In our series, only in one patient was Aeromonas bacteremia catheter-related. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the clinical isolates in this study were similar to those reported previously [4, 43, 44] . Most of the isolates were not susceptible to ampicillin or co-amoxiclav, in agreement with what should be expected because this is a phenotypic characteristic of the genus Aeromonas, where only one species, A. trota, shows susceptibility and occasionally some other strains [43, 45] . More than 90% of the Aeromonas isolates demonstrated a high level of susceptibility to third-or fourth-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, aztreonam, and tigecycline, indicating that these antibiotics would be the first choice for the empiric treatment of infections by Aeromonas. A quarter of strains were found to be resistant to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin + tazobactam, antibiotics widely used in the treatment of severe infections by Gram-negative bacteria. Multidrug-resistant isolates of Aeromonas spp. are of major concern.

Although about 30% of patients with Aeromonas peritonitis required treatment in the ICU, the in-hospital mortality for this condition was 20%. This relatively favorable outcome may be due to the fact that most of the patients received immediate drainage in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy.

During the study period, there have been several shifts in the taxonomy of the genus Aeromonas, in particular, the A. hydrophila subspecies dhakensis [51, 52] . Nowadays, only molecular characterization using the sequences of housekeeping genes like rpoD or gyrB enable the proper identification of the Aeromonas spp. Another limitation is that the pathogenicity of Aeromonas in some cases might be debated because analyses of toxin production were not performed. Nevertheless, the main strength of this study is that the cohort was generated from the database of a large teaching referral center in a defined time period.
