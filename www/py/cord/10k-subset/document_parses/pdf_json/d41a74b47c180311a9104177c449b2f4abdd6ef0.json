In response to SARS, pandemic influenza and Ebola, the British state adopted a voluntaristic and holistic approach; it encouraged the public to voluntarily follow its public health policies and considered the social and economic impact of outbreaks. American public health officials developed a narrower medical-legal approach to outbreaks that relied almost exclusively on a finding a biomedical solution and utilizing coercive legal authority to regulate citizens' behavior. In particular, the two countries have adopted divergent border control and quarantine policies; Britain has not tried to compulsorily isolate the sick or restrict their entry into the country, while the United States has set up and used the legal framework to do just that.",

I argue that we can understand their divergent responses by taking an historical approach. Britain's system of disease control, formed in the early part of the nineteenth century, was influenced by the theory of miasma and was originally located in the welfare sector of the state. In the United States disease control, developed late in the nineteenth century, was influenced instead by germ theory and was historically part of the military. By the twentieth century, these initial differences congealed into distinct styles of disease control. I argue that the distinct responses of the British and American states to EIDs in the twenty-first century are the most recent iterations of styles of disease control that each country has been developing since at least the nineteenth century.",

Likewise, officials declared that closing the border would be largely ineffective against pandemic influenza. Modeling suggested that even if it was 99.9 per cent effective, such actions would only delay an epidemic by 2 months (HPA, 2007; Department of Health (DH), 2011). British policies changed slightly in response to the outbreak of Ebola. While Britain has not denied entry to passengers traveling from West Africa, starting in October 2014 it began to screen air passengers. Health officials checked the temperatures and asked passengers from West Africa to fill out health reports (Gov.uk, 2015) .",

The model act allows a state to forcibly quarantine entire groups of people and it is possible for an individual person to be isolated for up to 10 days without a court hearing.

Disease control in America focuses on disease surveillance and reporting, contact tracing, epidemiological investigations and producing vaccinations and medications to limit the spread of the disease. This is generally how American public health organizations responded to SARS, the 2009 influenza pandemic and Ebola (CDC, 2004; CDC, 2010; GAO, 2011 ; White House Office of the Press Secretary, 2014a). Instead of Britain's 'Whole of Society Response', in America we get a much narrower medical-legal approach that focuses nearly exclusively on locating the infectious virus, producing medicine and antivirals, and creating the legal foundation to isolate the sick.",

Researchers sometimes point to political culture to explain the policy actions of the state. That does not seem to work in this case. While America has been described as a model of 'liberalism', in which the state should not intrude into the private lives of citizens (see Hartz, 1955) , the American state has taken various coercive actions to control the spread of disease and seems quite willing to restrict individual liberties in the name of public safety. Other researchers examine political structure. Mann (1993) notes that the British state has historically been more centralized than the American state. Yet, while the level of centralization may affect the capacity of the state to implement disease control it does not seem to explain the different styles of disease control that Britain and the United States have adopted.",

Rather than confining ourselves to the present, I argue that, while not the only factor, the different ways in which disease control became institutionalised in Britain and the United States from the nineteenth to twentieth century helps explain why they take such divergent actions in response to infectious disease in the twenty-first century.",

Over time, these different 'starting points' pushed Britain and the United States along distinct trajectories of disease control.

From 1850 to 1866, only 26 ships were quarantined in British ports and then the practice was eliminated altogether by the 'Sanitary Act' of 1866 (McDonald, 1951) .",

The 1866 Sanitary Act mandated that workhouses had to be well ventilated and not overly crowded. Medical and nuisance officers had to ensure that towns had clean water, that markets provided 'wholesome' food and that homes were made out of proper building materials (see Smith's Manual for Medical Officers of Health, 1873) .

By 1986 there were television and radio announcements about the disease and in 1987 health officials created a national 'AIDS week' and an informational leaflet about AIDS was mailed to 23 million homes in Britain.

Described as the 'bacteriological revolution' (a revolution that Worboys (2006) argues never occurred in Britain), US public health officials began to lose interest in sanitation and instead focused on controlling the infectious bodies of the sick (Humphreys, 1999; Duffy, 1990) . In the early part of the twentieth century this style of disease control was given the name 'New Public Health' (to distinguish it from the earlier sanitary focused approach). Writings by public health leaders (see Chaplin, 1910; Hill, 1916; MacNutt, 1915) focused on eliminating germs and controlling the bodies of the sick who carried them. MacNutt (1915, p. 91) wrote 'Human conduct is the great factor in public health, and also the most difficult to control'.",

Boardinghouses and synagogues were inspected by armed sanitary police and the sick were forcibly removed to hospitals (Markel, 1997) . In 1900, when cases of the plague appeared in San Francisco and Honolulu, public health officials instituted a community wide quarantine of Chinatown districts in both cities. Armed guards barred any of the residents from leaving and in Hawaii the whole district was accidently burnt to the ground (Markel, 1997; Mohr, 2005) .",

Although MCWA was also concerned with educating the public, its main strategy was to eliminate mosquitoes and their larva through insecticides. The MCWA became the CDC in 1946 and its focus on disease surveillance, investigation and laboratory research became a model for disease control in the United States (Etheridge, 1992) .
