Due to profound hypoxemia unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions, six (3.6%) of these patients were treated with ECLS in four ICUs. Four patients were treated with veno-venous pump-driven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO), and two patients were treated with pumpless lung assist (NovaLung iLA). The mean duration of support was 15 days. Four of the six patients survived (66.6%), one of the surviving patients was supported with iLA and the other three surviving patients were supported with ECMO. The two deaths were due to multiorgan failure, which occurred while the patients were on ECLS. Interpretation Extracorporeal lung support may be an effective treatment for patients who have H1N1-2009 infection and refractory hypoxemia. Survival of these patients treated with ECLS is similar to that reported for patients who have acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiologies and are treated with ECMO. 6 Most patients diagnosed with H1N1-2009 virus have had a self-limited respiratory illness, have exhibited symptoms similar to those of seasonal influenza, including cough, fever, sore throat, malaise and headache, and have recovered without complication. 7 However, approximately 5-9% of these patients in the United States 8, 9 and 11% in Canada 5 required hospitalization. Further, 20-36% of hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Over 80% of patients admitted to the ICU required mechanical ventilation and 17-40% died. 10 Infection with H1N1-2009 can result in rapidly progressive respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death. 11 Mechanical ventilation is usually necessary to support gas exchange in patients with ARDS, although mechanical ventilation itself can be associated with lung injury. Despite attempts to optimize ventilator settings, 12 hypoxemia or hypercapnia refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation may persist in a small subset of patients, and these patients may be treated with extracorporeal lung support (ECLS). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a technology of facilitating gas exchange over a microporous membrane by pumping the patient's blood through an extracorporeal circuit. Recently, a pumpless circuit was developed (interventional lung assist, iLA) that is specifically effective for carbon dioxide removal. 13 So far, ECLS has been provided in specialized centres as an alternative therapy for patients who have not responded to conventional treatment.

Notably, this outbreak disproportionately affected young females, Aboriginal patients, and those who did not have major pre-existing comorbidities. At present, ECLS for ARDS is generally considered as an alternative treatment in adults with ARDS who are unresponsive to other forms of support. At present, there is no consensus on absolute indications or contra-indications to ECMO or iLA. Initiation guidelines vary among centres and are based mostly on personal and institutional experience. As the H1N1-2009 pandemic evolved, however, ECLS teams received requests for this therapy. The many uncertain aspects of the pandemic further clouded the decision-making process. Specifically, the course of the disease was uncertain, as was the number of potentially affected individuals. Nonetheless, as more patients developed ARDS due to H1N1-2009 infection, it became clear that an attempt at ECLS would be required in some young, otherwise healthy individuals.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The greatest benefit of ECMO is expected to occur when initiated early in the course of severe lung injury before the evolution of increasing multisystem disease. However, it is challenging to identify patients who will not respond to more conventional therapies. Numerous studies have shown that ECMO is not beneficial and may be associated with increased mortality if offered to all patients who have ARDS according to the consensus criteria. 20 In 1979, the first randomized trial comparing ECMO with conventional ventilation for treatment of ARDS reported a survival rate of \\ 10% in both groups and no significant difference in mortality. 21 However, there has been recent interest in nonrandomized studies supporting the use of ECMO in adults who have severe hypoxic respiratory failure. 22 Most recently, the Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR) trial compared ARDS treatment with or without ECMO in patients who had very severe ARDS. In this study, 180 patients were prospectively randomized to treatment in centres that deliver ECMO or to treatment in centres that deliver conventional ventilation. 19 While the investigators were able to demonstrate an improvement in the composite outcome of death/cognitive dysfunction in favour of ECMO, there was no difference in all-cause mortality. 23 Furthermore, although these were patients with severe ARDS, ECMO was not the sole therapy in that treatment arm. With proper patient selection, the mortality among patients who have the most severely impaired gas exchange treated with ECMO can be lowered to approximate the mortality of those patients not requiring ECMO. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) influenza investigators recently reported their experience with ECMO for respiratory failure secondary to H1N1-2009 infection in ANZ. 29 In this series, ECMO usage for H1N1-2009 infection was frequent (68/201, 33.8%), whereas it was infrequent in Canada (6/168, 3.6%). The time from intubation to initiation of ECLS in ANZ was also shorter, i.e., mean two days vs mean five days in our series, although gas exchange parameters immediately prior to the initiation of ECLS were similar. The sole method of ECLS used in the ANZ series was vv-ECMO. Survival rates in both series were similar. While ECMO has been in use in Canada for over 20 yr, the Novalung iLA is a new device to Canada, approved in 2008, and has been used in very few centres. Proposed as an alternative to the full ECMO, the pumpless iLA circuit has demonstrated benefit in severe hypoxemic lung failure (PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio \\ 65 despite optimized ventilator settings). 30 Although this device is most beneficial for carbon dioxide removal, it may also improve oxygenation. The indications for iLA have therefore been extended by some to include the prevention of ventilator-associated lung injury during the early phase of ARDS. 13 This concept recognizes the inability to limit plateau pressures and tidal volumes in a situation of grossly diminished respiratory compliance without causing severe hypercapnia and profound respiratory acidosis. However, there are no published clinical trials regarding this device. The Canadian critically ill H1N1 patients were characterized by a hyperacute disease process and rapid deterioration, often within hours of hospital admission. Our limited experience of iLA for H1N1-infection cannot determine whether this treatment is effective. The results from a multicentre trial (XTRA-VENT, Clinical.Trials.Gov. identifier NCT00538928) may provide further insight into the utility of this therapy. As such, iLA therapy should be considered experimental at the present time, and treatment should be offered in the context of clinical investigation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 447, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 644, "end": 646, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 794, "end": 796, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1151, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1341, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1668, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1673, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1678, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1683, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1684, "end": 1688, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1861, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2665, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2923, "end": 2925, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Traditionally, the conduct of ECMO has required constant attention from a perfusionist who is present at the bedside. In our series, only one-half of the ICUs mandated ''in-house'' coverage by perfusion staff. The rationale for mandating constant attendance by perfusion staff was to deal with the unlikely scenario of a circuit catastrophe, such as inadvertent decannulation, air embolism, or clotting of the circuit. Circuit complications were quite frequent in our series (four of six patients required circuit/ oxygenator exchange), including two patients where ECMO specialists did not constantly supervise ECLS. Despite the practices that we observed, the general consensus is that ECLS specialists should remain in the hospital when a patient is undergoing ECLS. 22 In conclusion, the use of ECLS in the setting of H1N1-2009 infection is feasible and may be effective in certain centres. The use of ECMO and perhaps iLA may support gas exchange and prevent on-going lung injury and mortality in patients who have severe injury that is refractory to other interventions.

Une petite proportion des patients souffrant de cette grippe ont manifeste\u00b4une insuffisance respiratoire grave qui n'a pu e\u02c6tre traite\u00b4e efficacement avec les interventions the\u00b4rapeutiques traditionnelles. Dans ce compte-rendu, nous de\u00b4crivons les caracte\u00b4ristiques, le traitement et les devenirs de patients gravement malades au Canada qui avaient e\u00b4te\u00b4infecte\u00b4s par le virus H1N1-2009 et qui ont e\u00b4te\u00b4traite\u00b4s avec une assistance pulmonaire extracorporelle (APEC). M\u00e9thode Nous rapportons les re\u00b4sultats d'une se\u00b4rie de cas de six patients be\u00b4ne\u00b4ficiant d'une APEC qui ont pris part a`une e\u00b4tude de cohorte portant sur les patients gravement malades et chez qui l'infection au H1N1-2009 avait e\u00b4te\u00b4confirme\u00b4e. Les patients ont e\u00b4te\u00b4traite\u00b4s dans des unite\u00b4s de soins intensifs (USI) pour patients adultes et pe\u00b4diatriques entre le 16 avril 2009 et le 12 aou\u02c6t 2009. Nous de\u00b4crivons l'e\u00b4chantillon a`plusieurs degre\u00b4s traite\u00b4avec une APEC et le comparons a`l'e\u00b4chantillon plus large. R\u00e9sultats Pendant la pe\u00b4riode d'e\u00b4tude, 168 patients ont e\u00b4te\u00b4admis aux soins intensifs au Canada en raison d'insuffisance respiratoire grave provoque\u00b4e par une infection au H1N1-2009 confirme\u00b4e. En raison d'une hypoxe\u00b4mie profonde ne re\u00b4pondant pas aux interventions the\u00b4rapeutiques traditionnelles, six (3,6 %) de ces patients ont e\u00b4te\u00b4traite\u00b4s par APEC dans quatre USI. Quatre patients ont e\u00b4te\u00b4traite\u00b4s par oxyge\u00b4nation extracorporelle veino-veineuse par pompe (vv-ECMO), et deux patients ont e\u00b4te\u00b4traite\u00b4s par assistance pulmonaire sans pompe (NovaLung iLA). La dure\u00b4e moyenne d'assistance e\u00b4tait de 15 jours. Quatre de ces six patients ont surve\u00b4cu (66,6 %), l'un des patients survivants a e\u00b4te\u00b4traite\u00b4par iLA et les trois autres par ECMO. Les deux de\u00b4ce`s ont e\u00b4te\u00b4cause\u00b4s par une de\u00b4faillance multisyste\u00b4mique alors que les patients e\u00b4taient traite\u00b4s par APEC. Interpr\u00e9tation L'assistance pulmonaire extracorporelle pourrait constituer un traitement efficace pour les patients infecte\u00b4s par le virus H1N1-2009 et souffrant d'hypoxe\u00b4mie re\u00b4fractaire.
