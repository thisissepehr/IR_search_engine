However, the role of bypass axis of RAS (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Ang-(1-7)/Mas) in hepatic steatosis is still unclear. Here we showed that deletion of ACE2 aggravates liver steatosis, which is correlated with the increased expression of hepatic lipogenic genes and the decreased expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes in the liver of ACE2 knockout (ACE2 \u2212/y ) mice. Meanwhile, oxidative stress and inflammation were also aggravated in ACE2 \u2212/y mice. On the contrary, overexpression of ACE2 improved fatty liver in db/db mice, and the mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes were up-regulated. In vitro, Ang-(1-7)/ACE2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in free fatty acid (FFA)-induced HepG2 cells, and what's more, Akt inhibitors reduced ACE2-mediated lipid metabolism. Furthermore, ACE2-mediated Akt activation could be attenuated by blockade of ATP/P2 receptor/Calmodulin (CaM) pathway. These results indicated that Ang-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas axis may reduce liver lipid accumulation partly by regulating lipid-metabolizing genes through ATP/P2 receptor/CaM signaling pathway. Our findings support the potential role of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in prevention and treatment of hepatic lipid metabolism.",

More recently, we reported that activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/ Mas axis led to improved hepatic insulin resistance through the Akt/PI3K/IRS-1/JNK insulin signaling pathway 12 . On the other hand, loss of ACE2 activity worsens liver fibrosis in chronic liver injury models, and administration of recombinant ACE2 shows therapeutic potential 15 .

These results suggested that deletion of ACE2 may aggravate hepatic steatosis in ACE2 \u2212/y mice. The absence of ACE2 also regulates the expressions of genes related to oxidative stress and inflammation. Marker genes for oxidative stress signaling, as glutathione peroxidase (Gpx1), catalase and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) were reduced in ACE2 \u2212/y mice (Fig. 2C ). The expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were increased in ACE2 \u2212/y mice (Fig. 2D ).

Moreover, serum Ang II, TG and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were decreased by hepatic ACE2 overexpression (Fig. 3B-D) , with little change in serum cholesterol and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (Fig. 3C,D) . The amelioration of plasma lipid profiles after ACE2 overexpression suggested that ACE2 might affect whole-body insulin sensitivity. To test whether ACE2 improved glucose metabolism, a glucose tolerance tests (GTT) was performed.

We show that deletion of ACE2 aggravated hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in ACE2 \u2212/y mice. On the contrary, overexpression of ACE2 improved hyperglycemia and fatty liver in db/db mice. In vitro study, Ang-(1-7)/ACE2 ameliorated hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. Notably, Akt inhibitors reduced ACE2-mediated lipid metabolism, and what's more, ACE2-mediated Akt activation can be attenuated by blockade of ATP/P2 receptor/CaM pathway. Taken together, Ang-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas axis may reduce liver lipid accumulation partly by regulating lipid-metabolizing genes through ATP/P2 receptor/CaM signaling pathway.

LXR\u03b1 and SREBP-1c increase the expression of key lipogenic genes, including those for FAS, SCD1 and ACC 23 . ACC1 converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, and inhibits fatty acid entry into the mitochondria reducing \u03b2 -oxidation. FAS utilizes both acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to form palmitic acid (C16:0). Besides, adiponectin appears to have a pivotal role in improving fatty acid oxidation and decreasing fatty acid synthesis 24 . The liver has adiponectin receptors, and their stimulations lead to increased fatty acid \u03b2 -oxidation and thereby decreased hepatic TG content. Aberrant induction of these factors may contribute to hepatic steatosis. In the present study, the changes of these genes in ACE2 \u2212/y mice and ACE2-overexpressing HepG2 cells support the idea that ACE2 ameliorates hepatic steatosis.",

Acting to protect against oxidative stress is a complex system of enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, GPX, glutathione reductase, catalase) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (glutathione (GSH), vitamins C and D) 27 . In the present study, the increased lipid accumulation in the liver may be involved in the decrease in the expressions of enzymatic antioxidants genes and the resulting increased ROS production. The expression of oxidative stress signaling in ACE2 \u2212/y mice and FFA-induced ACE2-overexpressing HepG2 cells were in agreement with previous data.",

ATP has been demonstrated to be a signaling molecule to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [35] [36] [37] . The ATP receptors (P2X and P2Y receptors) mediate such action. P2X receptors are permeable to calcium, which are ligand-gated ion channels 37 . P2Y receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors which stimulate PLC to increase IP3 production, resulting in calcium release from internal stores 37 . Increased cytosolic free calcium activates CaM, leading to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway 38, 39 . In the present study, we found that the P2 receptor antagonists (PPADS) completely abolished ACE2 induced Akt activation, which reveals a critical role of ATP receptors in this process. Furthermore, Akt activation was also significantly blocked by IP3R antagonist (2-APB), CaM antagonist (CPZ) and depletion of extracellular calcium in HepG2 cells. These data reveal the possible roles of ATP/P2 receptor/CaM signal pathway in ACE2-mediated hepatic insulin resistance and liver lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. What is more, these findings offer another plausible explanation for the molecular basis of the relationship between the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis and liver glucose/lipid metabolism.",

The accompanying increase in oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production following liver lipid accumulation causes a further increase in insulin resistance, thereby establishing a vicious cycle 3 . Fatty acid synthesis cross-talks with insulin signaling, and Akt plays a pivotal role in glucose and lipid metabolism signaling pathway 41 . Akt has been found to not only regulate gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, but also play a critical role in the regulation of liver lipid metabolism. Activation of Akt represses lipogenesis and prevents excessive lipid deposition in the liver [42] [43] [44] . In addition, the increased phosphorylation level of Akt in the liver is associated with the amelioration of steatosis in diabetic mice 45 . In our more recently research on the effect of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis on hepatic insulin resistance, the phosphorylation levels of Akt increased markedly in ACE2-overexpressing cells, while significantly inhibited in the liver of ACE2 \u2212/y mice. As expected, Akt inhibitors can reduce ACE2-mediated lipid metabolism. Furthermore, hepatic overexpression of ACE2 improved hyperglycemia and fatty liver in db/db Mice. Together with these two studies, the mechanism underlying glucose and lipid metabolism could involve the ability of ACE2/Ang-(1-7) to activate Akt.",

The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsinized and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS, and the intensity of the fluorescence was immediately read using a FACScan flow cytometer (Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA),at 500 nm for excitation and at 530 nm for emission. Nile Red Assay. Nile red is an excellent stain for the detection of intracellular lipid droplets by a fluorescent microscopy or flow cytometry. The intensity of fluorescence represents the number of lipid droplets in cells. Comparing with oil-red O, Nile-red O staining has higher accuracy, and the operation of Nile-red O staining is simpler. The lipid content in cultured cells was quantified fluorometrically using Nile red. HepG2 cells were seeded at 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well into 12-well plates and then treated with 10 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) or 1 \u03bc mol/L A779 in the presence of Nile red solution at a final concentration of 200 ng/mL in PBS for 30 min. The intensity of the fluorescence was immediately read using a FACScan flow cytometer (Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), at 488 nm for excitation and at 550 nm for emission. Data from 10,000 single cell events were collected. To rule out false-positives, drug treatment in the absence of Nile Red was measured and taken as the background. The relative fluorescence intensities minus the background levels were used for data analysis. Scientific RepoRts | 6:21592 | DOI: 10.1038/srep21592",
