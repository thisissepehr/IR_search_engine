            "text": "Primates along with many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic ecological conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats. One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest-savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non-tree species (liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non-tree plants have been defined as fallback and non-preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forestsavannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. Am. J. Primatol. 77:948-962, 2015.",

            "text": "In the current context of rapid anthropogenically induced landscape modification across primate habitat countries, improving our knowledge about the capacity of primates to adapt is crucial [Corlett, 2011] . As anthropogenic activities cause the proportion of secondary forests to increase at the expense of primary forests, primate habitats are facing structural and dynamic changes [Pan et al., 2011] , which can affect forest composition and species abundance [Wright, 2005] . As a consequence, most primate species are forced to cope with large shifts in ecological conditions and associated food resources [Fahrig, 2003; Fischer & Lindenmayer, 2007; ]. An increasing number of studies are addressing the impact of habitat fragmentation on primates [reviewed in , demonstrating, in feeding ecology, varying dietary adjustments such as reduced frugivory [Cercopithecus cephus and nictitans: Tutin, 1999] , food diversification [Ateles geoffroyi: Chaves & Stoner, 2012] , increased reliance on low-quality food items [Eulemur collaris: Donati et al., 2011] , or on fallback resources [Propithecus diadema : Irwin 2008; Irwin et al., 2014; Pan troglodytes: Chancellor et al., 2012] and even incorporation of human cultivated items in the diet [Pan troglodytes: Chancellor et al., 2012; McLennan 2013] . Studying feeding ecology in fragments provides the opportunity to examine the plasticity of primate foraging behaviour [Boyle & Smith, 2010b; Chancellor et al., 2012] and to gain a better understanding of the resilience of primates living in these environments ]. In addition, such studies are essential to formulate more species-specific conservation measures [Boyle & Smith, 2010a; Chapman et al., 2007; Marsh, 2003; Onderdonk & Chapman, 2000] .",

Indeed, both species are known to maintain their frugivorous habits even in periods of fruit scarcity [White & Lanjouw, 1992; Wrangham et al., 1998 ], through various adaptive responses such as: (i) flexibility in ranging and grouping patterns according to the spatio-temporal fluctuations of food patches [chimpanzee: Hashimoto et al., 2003; Itoh & Nishida, 2007; Lehmann et al., 2007; bonobos: Mulavwa et al., 2008] , (ii) increase in the types of habitats used when fruit availability is low [chimpanzee: Basabose, 2005; Chancellor et al., 2012; bonobos: Mulavwa et al., 2010] and, (iii) for chimpanzees, a shift to consumption of fallback foods of lower quality, but which are more abundant Watts et al., 2012; Wrangham et al., 1991] . Since habitat fragmentation may lead to even more pronounced periods of fruit scarcity, studying the effect of fragmentation on feeding ecology is essential but still limited for chimpanzees [Chancellor et al., 2012; McLennan, 2013; Tutin, 1999] and almost unknown for bonobos [but see Thompson, 1997] . The discovery of bonobos also inhabiting fragmented environments, i.e., in forest-savannah mosaics, was only made in the late 1990s. This particular bonobo habitat has still received very little attention [Serckx, 2014; Thompson, 1997 Thompson, , 2001 although it is a particularly interesting place in which to study bonobo dietary plasticity, given its large spatio-temporal variation in resource availability .",

            "text": "Identifying the fallback foods (FBF) of primates living in fragmented environments is important because their exploitation may allow primates to subsist in higher densities than otherwise possible [Marshall et al., 2009] . In contrast to preferred foods that are consumed disproportionately relative to their abundance in the habitat [Marshall & Wrangham, 2007] , FBFs are defined as the resources consumed when the abundance of preferred foods decline [Harrison & Marshall, 2011; Marshall & Wrangham, 2007; Marshall et al., 2009] . FBFs are also typically lower in energy than preferred foods Doran-Sheehy et al., 2009; Irwin et al., 2014; Wrangham et al., 1998 ]. Two major publications presented an overview of the topic of fallback foods. Authors pointed out that we should distinguish between \"staple\" and \"filler\" FBFs because their roles differ in the diet and they have distinct evolutionary effects [Lambert, 2007; Marshall & Wrangham, 2007] . Staple FBFs are available and consumed throughout the year, may seasonally constitute up to 100% of the diet at a given time and are typically low-quality foods. Filler FBFs never constitute 100% of the diet, may be completely avoided when preferred foods are available but are usually high-quality items. Chimpanzees typically use FBFs as filler foods [Harrison & Marshall, 2011; Lambert, 2007; Marshall & Wrangham, 2007] , with variation in the types of the FBFs across sites [figs: Wrangham et al., 1993; insects: Yamagiwa & Basabose, 2009; bark cambium: Chancellor et al., 2012] . However, the classification of bonobos as staple or filler FBF consumers remains unclear because their FBFs have not yet been well identified [Harrison & Marshall, 2011; Marshall et al., 2009; Yamagiwa & Basabose, 2009] . Some studies have shown that bonobos switch to terrestrial herbaceous vegetation (THV) during times of fruit shortage [Conklin-Brittain et al., 2001] , but bonobos consumed THV of high quality [Malenky & Wrangham, 1994] , which makes their classification as FBFs ambiguous [Marshall et al., 2009] . Similarly, figs were reported to be more intensively consumed when the availability of other fruits decline [Hohmann et al., 2006 ], but it is still unclear whether figs represent FBFs for bonobos or not [Harrison & Marshall, 2011] . Harrison and Marshall [2011] concluded that bonobo consumption of FBFs is either very high or very low and that we need detailed comparisons of potential FBF use versus availability of preferred foods to define in which category of FBF consumers we should classify bonobos. Since studies have suggested that filler and staple FBFs have different effects on ape socio-ecology (i.e., the abundance of FBFs will influence primate carrying capacity in its habitat and thus the maximal group size as well as group cohesion, with cascading effects on social dynamics) [Marshall & Wrangham, 2007] , identifying the bonobo fallback strategy might be important to improve our understanding of the differences in the evolution of socio-ecology within the African Apes.",

We recorded fecal contents per food category: (i) fruits with large seeds, i.e., seeds larger than 2 mm which may be easily counted in the fecal remains (including seeds, skin and pulp remains), (ii) fruits with small and uncountable seeds (smaller than 2 mm), such as Ficus sp. or Musanga cecropioides (seeds, skin and pulp remains), (iii) foliage (fiber, digested fragments of leaves and flowers), (iv) fragments of insects or other animal matter and (v) other items (soil, small branches, mushrooms or undefined items). We visually estimated the percentage of each category within 5% intervals, based on its volume in the fecal material [Basabose, 2002] . We identified cleaned fruit seeds to the species level and counted large seeds. Non-fruit plant items were identified and described as accurately as possible.",

Over a period of 26 months, from May 2011 to June 2013, we monitored all trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 10 cm within 14 plots randomly located in the Nkala Forest (each plot measuring 0.04 ha, 0.56 ha in total). This represented a total of 346 trees belonging to 77 species. In May 2012, we added 8 additional plots (five 1 ha plots and three 0.25 ha plots, 5.75 ha in total) to improve our representation of fruiting trees. Our sample size increased by 2239 trees representing 32 additional species (14 monitored months). Every two weeks, we visited each of the plots and recorded which trees were fruiting by inspecting their crowns and counting the fruits on the ground [Basabose & Yamagiwa, 2002] . We then calculated an index of fruit availability (FAI). Fruit species considered for this index were derived by selecting tree species (i) eaten by bonobos (this study, Kano and Mulavwa 1992 Beaune et al., 2013) or (ii) producing fleshy fruits [Tailfer, 1989; Wilks & Issembe, 2000; Djoufack et al., 2007] (Supplementary Appendix 1, Table I ). We used each tree basal area to estimate the canopy volume (Strier, 1989 cited in Basabose, 2002 and calculated the monthly fruit availability index (FAI) as: FAI m \u00bc P pki \u00c2ba k where p is the proportion of trees of species k bearing fruits during the plot visit i and ba is the basal area (in square meters per hectare) of species k in the forest. We assigned for each date of fecal sampling collection the closest recorded FAI.",

Based on fecal samples, we defined important fruits as those present in more than 50% of fecal samples for at least 1 month [McLennan, 2013; Rogers et al., 2004; Wrangham et al., 1991] . We considered as \"important species\" the fruit species occurring in more than 10% of sampled days to represent fruit eaten regularly even if not intensively [Moscovice et al., 2007; McLennan, 2013] . For fecal samples, we made sure that the analysis covered a long enough period of time to detect all species consumed by the bonobos (cumulative distribution of species through time, Basabose, 2002) . We analysed whether the variation in food categories were correlated with each other and whether the two fruit categories and the daily number of consumed fruit species were correlated with the fruit availability index (approximate test of Spearman correlations, derived using a self-written function in R).",

We used a generalized linear model with a negative binomial error structure and log link function. To model the number of species consumed daily and to account for differences in daily sampling efforts, we incorporated the sum of all species observed per feces each day as the response and we included an offset term to control for the variation of sampled feces (the daily number of feces log transformed). We included the sine and cosine of the date, converted to a circular variable, to estimate seasonal patterns. We introduced a temporal autocorrelation term to account for the difference in sample size collection according to time. For this, we used the average of the residuals of all other sampled days derived from the full model and weighted by distance as an additional predictor. The weight function had the shape of a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero (maximal weight at distance equals zero) and a standard deviation chosen such that the likelihood of the full model with the derived variable (autocorrelation term) included was maximized [F\u20ac urtbauer et al., 2011] . After running the model, we checked various model diagnostics [Field, 2005; Quinn & Keough, 2002] . Dfbetas and variance inflation factors did not reveal any issues (Supplementary Appendix 1, Table II and  Table III ). As the data showed some potentially Am. J.

We used a food preference index (FPI) that measured relative use of species over their relative availability. Since we did not collect fruit availability for lianas and herbs, we estimated the food preference index only for important fruits of tree species. We calculated FPI using the following equation: FPI \u00bc F c /F a where F c represents the number of days the food was consumed and F a represents the number of days we scored the food as available [Chancellor et al., 2012; Doran-Sheehy et al., 2009 ].

            "text": "Fallback foods (FBFs) are, in contrast, species increasingly consumed when the availability of preferred foods decline [Marshall & Wrangham, 2007; Marshall et al., 2009] . We tested whether non-preferred fruits of tree species, important herb and liana species and unidentified fibers (i.e., residuals of THV and Marantaceae) should be considered as FBFs, by performing, for each species, a generalized linear model (GLM). We used GLMs with a negative binomial error structure and log link function for species present in more than one quarter of fecal samples. Because these models became unstable for less-consumed species, we used GLMs with binomial error structure and logit link function for the other important species. Only the response (n \u00bc 2,230) changed depending on GLM types. For negative binomial models, we used, for important fruit species, the seed abundance in feces as the response. We calculated seed abundance as the total number of seeds of the given species divided by the wet weight of the fecal sample and multiplied by 100 to obtain a standardized measure of the relative amount of seeds consumed per fruit species per fecal sample [Moscovice et al., 2007] . For unidentified fibers and small-seed species, we used the volume proportion in the feces as the response. For binomial models, we used the presence/absence of the species as the response. To test whether the consumption of the given species was related to the consumption of preferred foods, we incorporated as predictors the seed abundance of preferred foods. Since FBFs are consumed when availability of preferred species declines, we included FAI of preferred foods as a predictor. We also incorporated the global FAI as a predictor to test the influence of fruit tree availability on important fruit consumption. To account for temporal autocorrelation, we used the average of residuals of all other fecal samples derived from the full model and weighted (with the same function as for the previous models) by temporal distance as an additional predictor. Prior to running the models, we checked that correlations between predictors were not an issue with a Spearman test and that all predictors had a symmetrical distribution. Predictors of seed abundance were log-transformed and FAI of preferred foods was square-root transformed. All predictors were z-transformed to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to achieve more easily interpretable coefficients [Schielzeth, 2010] . After running the models, we checked various model diagnostics [Field, 2005; Quinn & Keough, 2002] . Dfbetas did not reveal any issues. Since the VIFs were too high for FAI of preferred foods and Dialium sp. abundance because of their high correlation (Spearman, r s \u00bc 0.56), we decided to remove Dialium sp. from the model. VIFs did not reveal any issues in the new models, and we removed potentially influential cases of leverage (Supplementary Appendix 3, Tables I and II). To check the overall effect of preferred food consumption and availability, we compared the deviance of the full model with that of a null model comprising only the autocorrelation term, using a likelihood ratio test. We further tested the effect of preferred food consumption by comparing the deviance of the full model with that of a reduced model comprising only the FAIs and the autocorrelation term, using likelihood ratio tests. We considered the species was a FBF when we found significant negative correlations (i) between its consumption and preferred food consumption (i.e., the comparison between the full and reduced model is significant and predictor estimates are negative) and (ii) between its consumption and FAI of preferred foods (i.e., the estimate of FAI of preferred foods is significantly negative).",

The data collection period was sufficient to identify all the important species but probably not all the consumed species ( Fig. 2A) . Fruits constituted the majority of species identified in fecal samples (100% of presence in fecal samples; feces mean volume: 95.2%; Table V in Supplementary Appendix 1); of these, one species, Musanga cecropioides was particularly frequent (55% of all feces). Foliage was much less common in the feces (31% of feces; feces mean volume: 4.1%), but one species, Haumania liebrechtsiana, was particularly common on trails (55% of food remain samples). Animal matter and other items were rarely found (0.1% and 7.5% of feces, respectively). The presence of fruits of M. cecropioides in feces was negatively correlated with the presence of other fruit species (Spearman, r s \u00bc \u00c0 0.92, P < 0.0001; Table V in Supplementary Appendix 1).

We found that M. cecropioides fruit consumption was clearly negatively correlated to fruit availability and abundance of other preferred fruits (Table II) , indicating its role as a FBF. We further investigated the role of non-preferred tree species, liana and herb fruit species.

Based on fecal samples collected over a two-year period, we found that bonobos inhabiting forest-savannah mosaics consumed a number of fruit species (n \u00bc 78) similar in number to those living in tropical dense forests (n \u00bc 93, at Wamba: Kano, 1992 ; n \u00bc 91, at Lui-Kotale: Beaune et al., 2013) . Of these, sixteen fruit species were predominantly consumed (called important fruits). Fecal analyses suggested that bonobos were highly frugivorous (95% of feces volume was fruits), but we may have underestimated fiber consumption due to an artefact of our methodology (mesh sieve size of 1 mm). Our investigations revealed a seasonal pattern of consumption for 12 out of the 16 most important fruit species. Four species were identified as preferred fruits, and five species as FBFs (Table I ). The consumption of the fruits of M. cecropioides and M. leucantha was especially important and we suggest that their role as FBFs may help explain the bonobo foraging strategy and perhaps also its cohesiveness in such a forest-savannah ecosystem.",

Both points suggest that these species are most probably FBFs or non-preferred foods, but their consumption may enable bonobos to remain highly frugivorous in forest-savannah mosaics. Interestingly, when analysing the selection of preferred and fallback foods, we found that all preferred fruits belong to tree species typical of mature forests (shade-bearer trees [Hawthorne, 1995] , Table I ) while fallback fruits are mainly found in edge forests or disturbed areas (M. cecropioides being a pioneer species observed in edge forests or close to cultivated fields; Uapaca sp., a non-pioneer light demanding species observed in edge and youngcolonizing forests [Hawthorne, 1995] ; M. leucantha, a Marantaceae typical of various habitat types, notably road and savannah edges [Dhetchuvi, 1996] ). This finding suggests that bonobos prefer to remain in mature forests, as already observed for nesting site preference , but need to extend their range of forest use to other habitat types in periods of fruit scarcity. This pattern has already been observed in the Kalinzu forest (Uganda), where chimpanzees favour Musangadominated secondary forest when fruit availability in mixed mature forest decreases [Furuichi et al., 2001] or in Wamba (DRC), where bonobos increase their swamp forest use when the abundance of specific fruits typical in this habitat increases [Mulavwa et al., 2010] . Chancellor [2012] even observed that chimpanzees living in forest fragments of Rwanda increasingly use forest edges when fruit availability declines, to be close to maize fields for crop-raiding. We never found cultivated items in fecal samples. However, this does not mean bonobos never consume crops, as local populations mainly cultivate non-fruit species within forest fields (Serckx, data not shown), of which remains are difficult to observe in fecal samples. In fact, local people already complain that bonobos periodically degrade sugar cane fields. Even if crop-raiding does not seem to be a current problem in the region, as observed in some chimpanzee populations [Chancellor et al., 2012; Humle & Matsuzawa, 2004; McLennan, 2013] , the regular use of disturbed habitats may lead to future human-bonobo conflicts, increasing the risk of poaching and injuries from snares for bonobos and also favouring zoonotic disease transmission [K\u20ac ondgen et al., 2008; Leendertz et al., 2006] .",

An increasing number of studies have shown that abundant FBFs may be a key factor determining primate carrying capacity [Chancellor et al., 2012; Furuichi et al., 2001; Hanya & Chapman, 2013; Marshall et al., 2009; Oates et al., 1990; Thomas, 1991] . For example, the consumption of Dombeya torrido allows chimpanzee densities to remain high in forest fragments of Rwanda despite their small and degraded habitats [Chancellor et al., 2012] . Musanga spp. abundance has been suggested to play a role in chimpanzee density of Kalinzu forest [Furuichi et al., 2001] and in Cercopithecus biomass in the Ituri forest (DRC) [Thomas, 1991] . It is thus possible that the importance of M. cecropioides and M. leucantha in bonobo diet partially explains the similar density we found between forest-savannah mosaics and dense forest populations .

Applying these concepts, it has been shown that gorillas can be considered as staple FBF consumers and chimpanzees as filler FBF consumers, but the classification of bonobos remains unclear [Harrison & Marshall, 2011; Marshall et al., 2009; Yamagiwa & Basabose, 2009] . Studies have demonstrated that gorillas usually form cohesive groups irrespective of fruit abundance but that frugivory and patchy distribution of fruits force them to extend their daily path length [Yamagiwa & Basabose, 2009 ]. Interestingly, we found a similar pattern for bonobos. First, bonobo cohesiveness at night was independent of fruit availability . Second, WWF trackers have reported that bonobos frequently cross their entire home range in one day to reach particular food trees (pers. comm. Paulin Ebabu). Direct observations are needed to confirm these observations. However, such behaviours, combined with the importance of abundant FBFs in their diet, suggest that bonobos, or at least the populations living in forest-savannah mosaics, might be considered as staple FBF consumers.",

Monthly proportion of preferred and fallback fruits in fecal samples Preferred and fallback foods are presented as the monthly proportion of fecal samples in which we observed the species (y-axis). Species are indicated in different colors. The index of fruit availability calculated from preferred fruits is superimposed on the figure with its scale on a second y-axis. The peak of fruit availability in July 2011 (FAI \u00bc 0.30 m 2 /ha) has been truncated to a value of 0.15 m 2 /ha to improve graphical representation.",

Both these results deserve further investigation to gain a better understanding of bonobo food species selection in forest-savannah mosaics. In particular, additional studies on bonobo nutritional ecology [Felton et al., 2009; Irwin et al., 2014; Raubenheimer et al., 2009 ] will help to address such questions and may also be helpful in the development of targeted conservation strategies [Chapman et al., 2004; Felton et al., 2010] .",
