The nanomaterials used for manufacturing nanofoods and nanopackaging materials are not assessed as new chemicals and currently, the industries follow established guidelines in the safety assessments. Interaction of nanoparticles with living cells and the implications for industry and consumers is not yet understood completely. Regulations governing nanomaterial developments, verification of their safety, fate, and how to dispose them through remediation treatments need to be understood. Experimental studies and research tests should be performed to generate hazard and exposure data leading to risk assessments and to answer concerns about the possible toxicological effects of exposure to nanoparticles in the air pollution. Acquiring evidence in the nanosafety area is fundamental for the development of proportionate controls and associated legislation. Being a very new technology, lack of data introduces potentially high uncertainty into assessments of environmental risk. The key areas of uncertainty must first be identified, and the strategic approach for addressing and managing these areas of uncertainty needs to be developed. A study from the USA (Monteiller et al. 2007) shows that toxicities of nanoparticles and large particles were similar when the dose was expressed in surface area. Hence, the complexity of the nanomaterials behavior in natural systems and the uncertainty introduced for hazard and exposure assessment can be answered by building on experiences with chemicals risk assessment. Toxicological assessment of nanomaterials in food applications by high content screening technique and Zebrafish model can provide valuable developmental toxicity information in terms of endpoint identification and mechanism elucidation (Donofrio 2006) .
