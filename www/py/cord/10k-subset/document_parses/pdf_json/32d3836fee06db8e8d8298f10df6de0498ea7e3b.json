To achieve the most complete representation possible and consider all available types and subtypes, including those for which only partial sequences are available, we based this tree on partial L1 sequences (approximately 430 nt). However, a tree based on complete L1 sequences from a subset of strains is available in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Figure S1) . The phylogenetic analyses revealed a monophyletic origin of APVs, with all bird viruses included in a clade that was separated from other vertebrate viruses (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S1 ). Our analyses also provide evidence for virus-host co-evolution. Viruses infecting birds belonging to the same family formed distinct, supported, and monophyletic clades, as seen for the two Ad\u00e9lie penguin (PaPV-1 and -2) and the three duck (DuPV-1, -2, and -3) viruses. Furthermore, viruses that infect birds within the same order also formed bootstrap-supported monophyletic groups, and this was especially evident for viruses infecting birds within the orders Passeriformes (FcPV-1 and ScPV-1) and Charadriiformes (PuPV-1, GuPV-1, -2, and 3, and KiPV-1-KiPV-7). Additionally, as illustrated in Figure 4B , the tree based on the whole L1 showed support for a clade that includes viruses infecting Galliformes (FlPV-1) and Anseriformes (DuPV-3), reflecting the closer phylogenetic relationship between those two orders (Prum et al., 2015) . The same was observed for the orders Charadriiformes and Sphenisciformes, both members of the clade Aequorlitornithes, whose close phylogenetic relationship was well matched by the highly supported clade of viruses that included all those from Charadriiformes and the two Ad\u00e9lie penguin viruses. Our analyses also indicate that host specificity constrains are relaxed among viruses infecting phylogenetically close birds.

This prediction is based on other APVs where the L1 start codon overlaps the stop codon of the L2 ORF and is immediately downstream of a highly supported splicing acceptor site. Furthermore, the predicted L1 protein, when translated as starting from this GTG codon, is homologous to other APV L1 proteins. Although yet to be experimentally substantiated, these genetic features lead us to hypothesize that this GTG may be used as an alternative start codon in the puffin viruses, as also previously hypothesized for an avian circovirus (Todd et al., 2007) . GTG is frequently used by bacteria as a start codon (Villegas and Kropinski, 2008) and there is evidence for the use of GTG as an alternative start codon in mitochondria (Bock et al., 1994; Perseke et al., 2011) . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GTG can be used as an alternative start codon in Drosophila melanogaster (Sugihara et al., 1990) and there is in vitro experimental evidence for its use to start protein translation in mammalian cell lines (Fuxe et al., 2000; Hwang et al., 2005) . Use of this alternative start codon has been shown to lead to lower protein production in comparison to ATG (Sugihara et al., 1990; Hwang et al., 2005) , so using this codon may be a way for the virus to regulate the expression of the L1 protein.

Within this genus, all DuPV types are monophyletic, suggesting a common ancestor. Although epidemiological information is still limited, there is evidence for a wide geographic distribution of DuPV-1 as the same virus was detected in India and Sweden. Interestingly, regardless of the geographic location where viruses were identified, all sequenced strains belonging to the same DuPV subtype are 100% identical and this is suggestive of a long association of the virus with its host.

All of these species are considered part of a mallard-type complex and whether they even represent good species has been questioned (Mank et al., 2004) . Any genetic barriers are, therefore, probably small and easy for viruses to bypass. Furthermore, there are no ecological barriers for virus transmission because they often live in close proximity in crowded environments and interbreed. These aspects of duck ecology favor viral transmission and, in turn, may influence viral ecology and evolution.
