Two dimensional gel electrophoresis of wild-type and mutant structural proteins revealed alterations in the isoelectric character of the alpha (1 D) protein of both mutant 205 and 280. These data suggest that alterations in the alpha (1 D) pro~in may be responsible for the phenotypic changes by the mutants. A delay in detectable virus-specified protein synthesis was exhibited in mutant-infected cells in comparison to wild-type. The amount of RNA synthesized in mutant-and revertant-infected cells was less than that synthesized in wild-type infected cells. Changes in virus-specified macromolecular synthesis in mutant and revertant-infected cells reflected a decrease in the ability of the viruses to attach to cells. Cytoplasmic lysates were immunoprecipitated by a modification of the procedure of BOND et al. (5) . Cytoplasmic lysates representing t.25 X 106 cells were diluted 10-fold in",

Previous studies have shown that surface iodination of intact potiovirus and mengovirus labels primarily the 1 D (VP 1 or alpha) protein of the respective virus eapsids (3, 12) and the 1 B (VP 2 or beta) protein is also labeled, but to a much lesser extent than the 1 D protein.

Multiple species of the alpha (1 D) and beta (1 B) proteins were reprodueibly deteeted by this technique in both the presence (Fig. 4 ) and absence (data not shown) of SDS prior to isoeleetrie focusing. Previous studies have demonstrated multiple isoelectrie species for the major eapsid proteins of poliovirus [VP 1 (1 D), VP 2 (1 B), and VP 3 (1 C)] (9, 23) and EMC virus [alpha (1 D) and beta (1 B)] (6). VRIaSEN et al. (23) also excluded the possibility that the multiple species are derived from differential binding of SDS or the accumulation of mutants in the original virus stoek. These authors suggested that the multiple species may result from heterogeneity in the cleavage of structural protein precursors; although the sequenees of the amino-and earboxyl-termini of the major eapsid polypeptides of mengovirus were determined without mention of sequenee variations (24) . We suggest that the charge heterogeneity of these molecules may reflect differences in the interaction of these proteins with the ampholines. The different protein species observed may represent different forms of the viral proteins associated with either intraeellular partieles or free extraeellular particles or extraeellular particles bound to or eluted from membranes, assuming that these particles share the same buoyant density in equilibrium gradients. Therefore, the heterogeneity observed may reflect differenees in the manner of isolating virus partieles, whether intraeellularly or from lysed cells.",

This determinant may serve as or be part of a funetional attachment site on the surface of virus partieles that determines their affinity for various cells. Atomic resolution of the structure of another pieornavirus, human rhinovirus 14, revealed a large cleft on the ieosahedral faee that has been postulated to serve as the host eell receptor binding site (18) . The large cleft separates the major part of five 1 D (alpha) subunits from the other viral protein subunits. Sinee the pieornaviruses share similar struetural eharaeteristies, by analogy it seems reasonable to speculate that mutations in the 1 D (alpha) protein could affect the strueture of the deft, and thus, alter the binding affinities of the mutant and revertant viruses. Alteration of the mengovirus host cell receptor binding site may lead to changes in affinity for erythrocytes as well as other cell types which may explain the lack of virulence of the mutants in mice.

            "text": "HA + revertants were isolated from the brains of mice infected intracranially with mutant 205 (2) . In addition to regaining agglutination activity, the revertants were also virulent for mice and exhibited a slight increase in plaque size. However, revertants required 103. to 104-fold more P F U to kill mice than the wild-type virus. Since the isoelectric character of t/he proteins of the HA + revertants were identicM to that of mutant 205, this partial phenotypic reversion may have resulted from a change in an uncharged amino acid associated with a determinant, located on the alpha (1D) protein, which partially restores its biological activities. The partial reversion of this mutation may involve modification of the altered surface determinant, increasing the binding affinity of the virus for cells and restoring virulence, but would not result in reappearance of the isoelectric species absent in mutant 205 and revertant alpha (1 D) capsid proteins. Alternatively, mutant 205 may express more than one mutation since complete reversion to w i l d -t~e virulence and plaque size did not occur and the isoelectric profile of the alpha (1 D) protein was the same as that of mutant 205. However, revertants were not isolated from mice infected intracranially with mutant 280, which shared biological properties as well as alpha (1 D) protein alterations with mutant 205. Therefore, the mutation observed in the alpha (1 D) structural protein of mutant 280 is apparently more stable than that of mutant 205. However, unlike mutant 205, expression of the mutation of mutant 280 resulted in a more subtle, yet reproducible change in the isoelectric point of one of the four alpha (1 D) protein species.",

            "text": "Changes in virus-specified macromolecular synthesis in mutant and revertant virus-infected cells can be explained by a decrease in the ability of these viruses to attach to cells. These data suggest that a smaller proportion of cells were productively infected with the mutant and revertant viruses in comparison to wild-type. Therefore, the effective MOI for the mutant and revertant viruses would be less than that of wild-type. This difference can be explained by changes in the cellular binding affinities; and the higher particle : P F U ratios exhibited by the mutant and revertants (2), assuming that a greater proportion of noninfectious particles would lower the probability of these viruses to infect cells. This interference phenomenon would explain why P F U values obtained under dilute conditions could not be used to accurately predict the fraction of infected cells in high particle : cell infections. Since fewer cells would be productively infected with mutant and revertant viruses, less virus-specified RNA would be synthesized, although the peak hour of RNA synthesis would be the same as that of wild-type. Therefore, less RNA would be available for translation; and protein synthesis, as detected by immunoprecipitation, would appear to be delayed in ceils infected with the mutant viruses. Changes in the metabolic rates of mutant, virus-specified gNA synthesis would predict different results than those presented here if tile fraction of infected cells were similar to ~t d -t y p e infections. Collectively, our data suggest that the phenotypie changes expressed by the mutants may be due to mutations toeated exclusively within the alpha (1 D) coding region of the genome.",

Consistent with these results, we have identified two different mutations in the alpha (1 D) capsid protein, which maps to the 3' end of tiffs region, of two avirulent mengovirus mutants. In addition, KO~tARA et al. (14) have stated that a molecular recombinant of the Sabin vaccine strain of poliovirus containing VP 1 (1 D) and most of VP 3 (1 C) of the neurovirulent Mahoney strain is virulent, but not as virulent as the Mahoney strain and retain the small plaque morphology of the Sabin strain. Our data also indicate that changes in the alpha (1 D) protein result in altered virulence of a pieornavirus. Since revertants of mutant 205 shared similar characteristics with the poliovirus recombinant, the plaque-forming ability of a particular virus isolate may be a characteristic that reflects as well as contributes to its virulence. Future experiments which compare the nueleotide sequences of the nmtants and revertant structural proteins to that of the parental wild-type virus will be useful in determining the genetic basis for the altered biological properties exhibited by the mutant and revertant viruses.",
