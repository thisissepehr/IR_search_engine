Nitrates were and still are in widespread clinical use for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions, particularly angina pectoris 1 . Nitrates are an exogenous source of nitric oxide (NO), a labile gas that can diffuse across cell membranes into vascular smooth muscle cells and stimulate the action of soluble guanylate cyclase to convert guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cGMP 2 . The formation of cGMP then initiates a cascade of reactions that ultimately decreases intracellular calcium levels, thereby promoting relaxation of the smooth muscle 3, 4 . Therefore nitrates, via their relaxant effects on vascular smooth muscle, act as mixed dilators of arteries and veins. The resulting decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac preload, coupled with improved perfusion of ischaemic areas of the myocardium, leads to a clinically useful anti-anginal effect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 734, "end": 736, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 737, "end": 738, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Origins of the cGMP/PDE5 project at Pfizer"}, {"text": "However, the therapeutic potential of nitrates is limited by the rapid induction of tachyphylaxis with prolonged administration 5 .

The scientific team at Pfizer therefore proposed that a downstream target in the NO/cGMP pathway could be modulated. Cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) are degraded by intracellular PDEs (FIG. 1) . In the mid-1980s, five subtypes of PDEs were identified. PDE3 and PDE4 specifically catalyse the breakdown of cAMP, whereas PDE1 and PDE2 catalyse the breakdown of both cAMP and cGMP. The fifth member of this group, PDE5, exclusively catalyses the breakdown of cGMP (TABLE 1) . PDE5 is present in the smooth muscle of the systemic vasculature, and in platelets. Studies by Corbin et al. revealed that the regulatory domain in the amino-terminal portion of PDE5 contains a phosphorylation site (serine 92), two allosteric cGMP-binding sites, a and b, and at least a portion of the dimerization domain. The catalytic domain in the carboxy-terminal portion of the protein contains the two Zn 2+ -binding motifs A and B, and a cGMP substratebinding site 6 (FIG. 2) . In 1986 Pfizer formed a project team of scientists at Sandwich, with the aim of developing a selective inhibitor of PDE5 and evaluating its preclinical pharmacology (TIMELINE) . Eventually the team succeeded in synthesizing novel pyrazolopyrimidines that were highly potent inhibitors of PDE5. A compound designated chemically as 1-[[3-(6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1H-pyrazolo [4,3-d] pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulphonyl]-4-methylpiperazine, was chosen for further profiling (FIGS 3, 4) . It was initially named UK-92,480, but is now better known as sildenafil, of which the citrate salt is marketed under the trade name Viagra. The compound was demonstrated to have very good potency (an IC 50 of 3.5 nM against PDE5 derived from human platelets), and excellent selectivity over PDEs 1-4 (REF. 7 ). Moreover, in preclinical studies, this compound displayed vasodilatory effects, abrogated platelet aggregation 8 , and inhibited thrombus reformation in a damaged carotid artery (modified Folt's model). Therefore, in 1989 UK-92,480 was selected to undergo further development and eventually entered clinical trials in 1991 (REF. 9 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 728, "end": 741, "text": "Corbin et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1106, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1293, "text": "(TIMELINE)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1510, "text": "[4,3-d]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1614, "text": "(FIGS 3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1617, "text": "4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1926, "end": 1927, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2043, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2261, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 352, "text": "(FIG. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 621, "end": 630, "text": "(TABLE 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1115, "text": "(FIG. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "PDE5 is selected as a target"}, {"text": "In 1991 studies in healthy volunteers commenced, in which single doses of UK-92,480 up to 200 mg were administered.

Prior to then, many clinicians considered ED to be either a relatively trivial issue and/or a condition that was predominantly attributable to psychological causes. However, urologists interested in ED had started treating their patients with intracavernosal injections of vasodilating drugs (for example, papaverine and prostaglandin E1) that functioned by modulating levels of cAMP. This pharmacological approach worked for many patients, but drawbacks included the invasive nature of the treatment, the induction of an 'artificial' erection that would often last long after intercourse had finished, with the added risks of local bleeding, bruising and priapism (a prolonged painful erection lasting longer than 6 hours). There was no doubt that an effective oral agent would be a major breakthrough in the treatment of this distressing condition, although at the time few researchers and clinicians in the field thought this was possible.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Corpus cavernosum"}, {"text": "The decision to undertake pilot studies with sildenafil in ED was supported by the observation that penile erections were a common side effect in the multipledose sildenafil Phase I study. Furthermore, emerging data implicated NO as a key mediator of the neural and haemodynamic effects that lead to penile erection in men. In particular, in the early 1990s, Ignarro and others reported that NO is the neurotransmitter that is released from cavernous nerves during sexual stimulation. The NO diffuses into vascular smooth muscle cells of the penis, stimulating the production of cGMP and leading to corpus cavernosum smooth muscle relaxation, vasocongestion, veno-occlusion (by constriction of the venous outflow from the penis against the tunica albuginea) and, ultimately, erection [13] [14] [15] . Local neural production of high quantities of NO in the presence of sexual stimulation enables selective vasodilatation of the penile vasculature. The Pfizer team postulated that the administration of an inhibitor of cGMP breakdown would enhance and prolong the vasodilatory response, but only during sexual stimulation. The prospect of an oral agent that could work naturally with sexual stimulation to facilitate and maintain erections, without causing excessive vasodilatation in the systemic vasculature, was indeed an exciting prospect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 784, "end": 788, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 789, "end": 793, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 794, "end": 798, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Corpus cavernosum"}, {"text": "Clinical studies in erectile dysfunction. In late 1993 the first clinical study in patients with ED was undertaken using a very novel trial design. In order to overcome the practical problem of confirming an erectogenic effect while allowing the patients to be sexually stimulated, a Rigiscan device that contains two loops that are placed round the base and tip of the penis was used to monitor and record the girth and hardness of the penis during sexual stimulation. In order to maximize the chances of detecting a signal, the patients selected for the first two studies were relatively healthy men with ED but no clinically apparent cardiovascular diseases or other underlying risk factors. By mid-1994, after completion of two separate clinical studies, single doses of sildenafil were shown to enhance erectile responses to sexual stimulation and to be well tolerated 16 ; moreover, a clear dose-response relationship was observed 16 . After this initial success, a full development programme was designed. Again, novel clinical trial designs (including the development of a new instrument, the International Index of Erectile Function 17 ) were used.

Subsequent in vitro and in vivo investigations confirmed that the transient visual side effects observed with sildenafil treatment were almost certainly due to weak inhibition of PDE6, a cGMP-metabolizing enzyme that is present exclusively in photoreceptors. Sildenafil was shown to have similar potency against PDE6 in all species routinely evaluated in toxicological screens, and it was further demonstrated that long-term sustained inhibition of PDE6 by sildenafil (even at doses many times greater than those administered to humans) did not lead to any lasting damage to the structure and function of the eye 30-32 .

Weaning from chronic NO treatment in patients with ARDS was facilitated by oral sildenafil 102 . An initial case report of an adult patient suffering from severe pulmonary arterial hypertension who was treated chronically with very high doses of oral sildenafil indicated that this approach might be effective 103 . In paediatric patients, the administration of intravenous prostacyclin is hampered to a greater extent by problems associated with the mode of administration than it is in adult patients. An early study reporting the successful use of oral sildenafil in a child with severe pulmonary hypertension therefore attracted a lot of attention, not only within the medical community but also in the media 104-106 . Trials addressing the characterization of the acute effects of sildenafil on pulmonary and systemic haemodynamics in a larger number of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension showed that sildenafil effectively reduced pulmonary vascular resistance in a dose-dependent manner 107 . Notably, the vasodilatory effects were restricted primarily to the pulmonary circulation, and were significantly stronger than the effects seen with inhaled NO. In combination with inhaled iloprost, augmentation of the pulmonary vasodilatory effect of each single agent was observed 107,108 .

In patients suffering from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)related pulmonary hypertension, sildenafil was effective in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, as it was in PPH 118, 119 . Recent data also suggest that long-term oral sildenafil treatment in patients with non-operable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is beneficial 120 . The importance of this finding lies in the fact that there is currently little to offer these patients in the way of therapeutic options, with the exception of lung transplantation. (SUPER-1 study) . The growing body of evidence from various studies between 1998-2001, which had already demonstrated the efficacy of sildenafil in the treatment of PAH, led to the design of a large, randomized, controlled, multinational trial to provide final proof of this new treatment concept, and to obtain legal approval for sildenafil as a new treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The SUPER-1 (Sildenafil Use in Pulmonary HypERtension) study started in 2002 and included 278 patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension who were treated either with placebo or sildenafil (20, 40 or 80 mg) orally three times daily (TID) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint in this trial -as in many previous trials with other medications similarly indicated -was the change from baseline to week 12 in the 6-minute walk test. Sildenafil, at all of the applied doses, improved exercise capacity (up to 50 metres (placebo-corrected value) in the 80 mg TID group), functional class and haemodynamics, as compared with placebo-treated patients, and was very well tolerated 121 . Additionally, patients completing the double-blind phase were able to enter a long-term extension trial, which was conducted over a 2-year period with 80 mg sildenafil TID. The increase in the 6-minute walk distance achieved after 3 months in the placebo-controlled phase was maintained even after a year of therapy, as were the improvements in functional class, which are both strongly indicative of the maintenance of the effect in spite of the severity of the disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 339, "text": "118,", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 340, "end": 343, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 502, "end": 505, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1774, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 690, "end": 705, "text": "(SUPER-1 study)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Clinical experience with sildenafil for the treatment of chronic pulmonary hypertension."}, {"text": "Based on the very favourable mid-and long-term effects of this new oral treatment, sildenafil was approved by the FDA and the EMEA in 2005 for the treatment of patients suffering from PAH. Both agencies decided to approve only the 20 mg TID dose, as only a flat (nonsignificant) dose-effect relationship between 20-80 mg TID was observed regarding the primary endpoint of the study, the change in 6-minute walking distance over 12 weeks of treatment. In addition, analysis of sildenafil plasma levels in the SUPER-1 study showed no dose-effect relationship with the doses studied (Pfizer Chemical Research Group, unpublished data). There is evidence from some clinical and experimental settings that the duration of action of sildenafil might not be accurately reflected by plasma levels and the applied dosage 122 . It has been shown that the affinity of sildenafil for PDE5 is even increased after intracellular phosphorylation of the enzyme 123 . In addition, conformational changes to PDE5 and the slow dissociation rate of sildenafil from the enzyme could contribute to the flat dose-effect relationship [124] [125] [126] [127] . One possible explanation is that sildenafil binding to the catalytic site of PDE5 could occur at higher affinity intracellularly than estimated previously, which might retard clearance of the inhibitor from the cells (G. Butrous, personal communication). On the other hand, however, in the SUPER-1 trial there were clear trends in some secondary endpoints (some showed statistically significant differences between the three applied doses) indicating that, for a subgroup of patients, higher doses might be more efficacious than the approved 20 mg TID dosage. Moreover, in the majority of preceding short-and long-term studies, daily doses of 100-300 mg were investigated and reported to be efficacious and well tolerated [107] [108] [109] 111, 128 .

The decrease in arterial oxygenation and wasting of the small ventilatory reserve of these patients are important negative consequences of this effect. Oral sildenafil, however, caused pulmonary vasodilatation in patients with lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension, with an overall vasodilatory potency corresponding to that of intravenous prostacyclin. In contrast to the infused prostanoid, selectivity for well-ventilated lung areas was demonstrated for sildenafil, resulting in an improvement, rather than deterioration, of gas exchange 143 . Pulmonary hypertension impairs right ventricular performance because it increases right-heart afterload. However, it is still unclear to what extent exercise tolerance is limited by this mechanism. In a recent investigation, this issue was addressed under conditions of acute hypoxia at sea level, and prolonged hypoxia at the altitude of Mount Everest Base Camp 144 . These investigations were performed in healthy volunteers to exclude other confounding factors that might have added to the limitation of exercise tolerance in patients suffering from chronic hypoxia (such as muscle wasting or chronic immobilization). In essence, acute and prolonged hypoxia induced significant pulmonary hypertension in the study subjects. As expected, exercise tolerance was dramatically reduced as a consequence of severe hypoxaemia and significant pulmonary hypertension. Sildenafil significantly reduced pulmonary hypertension under resting conditions, as well as during exercise. The most interesting finding of this study was that the reversal of pulmonary hypertension resulted in an immediate improvement of exercise tolerance, irrespective of improvements in oxygenation. Further studies investigating the effects of acute and chronic sildenafil administration in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension confirmed the anti-pulmonary hypertensive potential, and the beneficial effects of sildenafil on exercise performance, under these conditions 145, 146 . The results of these studies stimulated further investigations that addressed the therapeutic potential of this drug in patients suffering from chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension as it occurs in various chronic diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease and obstructive sleep apnoea) [147] [148] [149] [150] .

Concerning the cerebral vasculature, numerous studies have addressed the distribution of regional brain perfusion in health and disease states 176, [182] [183] [184] . Investigations addressing the cerebral effects of sildenafil showed no changes in overall cerebral blood flow 173, 175, 177 after administration of this agent. On the other hand, despite the absence of changes in overall cerebral blood flow, an effect of the PDE5 system on cognitive function 185 , repair mechanisms after stroke and expression profiles of second messenger levels in distinct brain areas have been proposed 45, 186, 187 . This discrepancy might well be reconciled by a recent finding suggesting that sildenafil significantly improves neurovascular coupling while leaving overall cerebral blood flow unchanged 188 . Furthermore, this finding is in line with previous observations that the initial blood flow response to cortical activity is mainly governed by stimulation of the NO system 187 . It has also been proposed that there might be therapeutic potential for sildenafil in cerebral ischaemic disorders, because cGMP levels were shown to be involved in the repair of ischaemic brain tissue and sildenafil reduced the size of the infarction area in an experimental rodent model 45 . Interestingly, the same group provided evidence that sildenafil significantly increased cGMP levels and induced neurogenesis in a model of neuronal growth 189 . The study also showed that sildenafil significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of Akt in neurospheres. This effect was associated Box 1 | Further insights into the mechanism of action of sildenafil An interesting further insight into the mode of action of sildenafil comes from several preclinical investigations, including a recent publication by Musicki et al. 190 , which investigated the effects of long-term treatment of sildenafil in young and aged rats. In aged rats, but not in their young counterparts, sildenafil prolonged erection and increased the protein expression of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phosphorylated Akt. Therefore the description of the mode of action of sildenafil in erectile dysfunction, and possibly also in pulmonary vascular diseases, can be further elaborated. It can be proposed that the initial increase in NO levels -due to neurogenic stimulation or a result of alveolar distension, for example -is followed by subsequent maintenance of vasodilatation by increased endothelial generation of NO via activated eNOS. It can also be speculated that the resulting increase in blood flow, and consequently shear stress, across the vascular endothelial cell surface activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, which phosphorylate and thereby further activate eNOS. The activated eNOS can then lead to a sustained further release of NO, which acts to maintain the smooth muscle relaxation, vascular engorgement and increased blood flow (see figure) . As sildenafil is being explored for other potential indications, and provided there is a dual effect of chronic administration on activation of eNOS and inhibition of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the therapeutic potential for various diseases involving vascular pathology might therefore be greater than originally envisaged.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 112, "text": "173,", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 113, "end": 116, "text": "174", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 212, "end": 215, "text": "175", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 305, "end": 309, "text": "173,", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 310, "end": 314, "text": "176,", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 315, "end": 318, "text": "177", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 422, "end": 425, "text": "178", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 657, "end": 662, "text": "[179]", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 663, "end": 668, "text": "[180]", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 669, "end": 674, "text": "[181]", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 820, "end": 824, "text": "176,", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 825, "end": 830, "text": "[182]", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 831, "end": 836, "text": "[183]", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 837, "end": 842, "text": "[184]", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 955, "end": 959, "text": "173,", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 960, "end": 964, "text": "175,", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 965, "end": 968, "text": "177", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1272, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1277, "text": "186,", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "187", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1474, "text": "188", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1945, "end": 1947, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2108, "text": "189", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2482, "text": "Musicki et al. 190", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3625, "end": 3632, "text": "figure)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Cerebral circulation."}, {"text": "with an increase in the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a downstream target of Akt.

Blood flow (Q) in the pulmonary circulation must, ideally, be directed to well-ventilated areas (symbolized by big V (ventilation) and O 2 (oxygenation) in the largest alveolus (blue circle at bottom of figure)) to ensure optimized gas exchange ('matching'), whereas only a small amount of blood should flow through areas of minor or no ventilation (midsize and small alveolus, respectively) (left panel). Lung vessel dilatation is mainly regulated by the compartmentalized production of nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent intracellular cGMP formation, where alveolar distension and oxygenation represent the most potent stimuli for this local NO release. Similarly, less NO/cGMP is produced in non-ventilated areas of the lung, resulting in hypoxic vasoconstriction (the so called von Euler-Liljestrand mechanism). During application of non-selective vasodilators and/or under disease conditions (for example, chronic obstructive lung disease, lung fibrosis, sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome), vasodilatation is induced in poorly or non-ventilated areas of the lung resulting in venous admixture and worsening of gas-exchange ('mismatch', right panel). There is strong evidence that oral sildenafil preferentially dilates vessels in well-ventilated areas of the lung, thereby both reducing overall vascular resistance and improving overall oxygenation ('re-matching' drug)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "PDE nomenclature and families", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": ",78 , because the most prominent stimulus for UK-92,480 (later sildenafil) selected as candidate drug to enter clinical development for cardiovascular indications.Ignarro et al.13 described the role of nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter that is released from the cavernous nerve during sexual stimulation.Various published reports about the successful treatment of different forms of pulmonary hypertension with oral sildenafil; initiation of the pivotal Phase III trial assessing efficacy of sildenafil in pulmonary arterial hypertension (SUPER-1).First studies in erectile dysfunction proving efficacy of single doses of sildenafil in enhancing erectile responses during sexual stimulation.First intravenous placebo-controlled study (Pfizer study 1024) evaluating the effect of different doses of sildenafil in pulmonary hypertensive patients.Approval of sildenafil as Revatio for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension by the FDA and by the EMEA.UK-92,480 was not further developed for cardiovascular indications because of its relatively short half-life and potential interactions with nitrates.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Physiological and/or functional roles of PDEs", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>PDE family </td><td>Role(s) </td><td>Evidence*\n</td></tr><tr><td>1 </td><td>Vascular smooth muscle proliferation; Ca2+ modulation of olfaction\n</td><td>Broad distribution, but highest levels in proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells, testes, heart and neural tissues (for example, olfactory epithelial cells).
