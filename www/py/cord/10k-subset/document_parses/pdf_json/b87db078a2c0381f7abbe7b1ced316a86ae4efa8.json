Adenoviruses frequently cause upper respiratory tract infections in humans and antiadenoviral antibodies are found in 35-70% of the population. Therefore in the majority of potential patients receiving adenoviral gene therapy, the contact of virus particles and blood will lead to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. These complexes have the ability to induce inflammatory reactions via an activation of the complement system. We have determined the level of C3a (the most reactive complement component) generated in isolated citrate plasma of healthy individuals after challenge with recombinant and wild-type adenoviruses in amounts corresponding to virus blood levels to be expected in patients during adenoviral gene therapy.

Current concerns regarding their application in humans are derived from the appearance of severe lifethreatening inflammatory reactions which were seen in one patient during a clinical trial for the correction of an inborn liver defect. This patient received a dose of 3 \u00d7 10 11 Ad5 particles/kg via hepatic artery infusion. 1,2 Some hours after virus infusion he developed a complex of clinical symptoms including hyperpyrexia, clotting disorders, thrombocytopenia and jaundice. Three days after virus application he died due to the onset of severe lung perfusion disturbances (adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) and multiple organ failure (MOF). Four of five patients who received a comparable high virus dose also developed hyperthermia of about 40\u00b0C, but recovered without major problems. 2 tory reaction, but the precise pathomechanism remains unclear. In this article, we would like to provide evidence that a strong complement activation might have been involved in the observed reactions. It has been known for a long time that adenoviruses are able to induce an antibody-dependent activation of the complement system in human plasma, but the level of activation which is reached during clinical adenoviral gene therapy (especially in intravascular infusions) might have been underestimated in the past. We will show that challenge of isolated human plasma with serotype 5 adenoviruses in amounts corresponding to blood levels reached in the above-mentioned trial, generates a level of complement activation, which holds the potency to induce serious inflammatory reactions.",

            "text": "Complement activation is a physiological defense mechanism which induces rapid destruction and phagocytosis of inoculated microbes and foreign bodies. Complement activation can occur by antigen-antibody complexes (classical pathway) and directly after plasma contact with a number of microbial components or foreign surface (alternative pathway). 3, 4 The majority of adults carry antibodies against adenoviral hexon group antigens 5,6 due to previous adenoviral infections. The direct inoculation of viral particles into the circulation in such individuals will usually induce the formation of antigen-antibody complexes and subsequently complement activation. Factors influencing the number of antigen-antibody complexes will depend on the route of administration (systemic or local), the virus dose, the amount and type of pre-existing antibodies and the activity of regulatory proteins. During the early phase of complement activation, the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are generated. These mediators induce a broad variety of inflammatory reactions, such as IL-1 and TNF release, 7-9 activation of neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages, 10 contraction of pulmonary vasculature, 11 changes in vascular permeability, 12 and platelet aggregation. 13 Systemic activation of the complement system, as known from patients suffering from sepsis, severe burns or injuries, could induce autodestructive inflammatory reactions, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure (MOF). [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Both types of clinical symptom complexes have been observed in the patient who died during the OTCD trial, which suggests an involvement of the complement system. In this article, we will discuss prophylactic measures which might help to control or avoid excess activation of the complement system after adenoviral gene therapy in humans.",

This finding suggests a strict antibodydependence of complement activation in human plasma. To further verify the role of pre-existing antibodies for complement activation in this system, immunoglobulin was removed from citrate plasma samples by gel filtration on protein-G sepharose. The filtration procedure itself induced some complement activation, but after removal of the immunoglobulins, the addition of virus particles no longer induced C3a release ( Figure 3 ). After reconstitution of Ig-depleted plasma with polyvalent immunoglobulin (containing an average amount of neutralizing anti-Ad antibodies at a titer of 1/256) to a concentration of 2.5 mg Ig/ml (about 20% of physiological Ig serum concentration), the previous responsiveness to adenovirus challenge was demonstrated. Complement activation via the classical pathway by adenovirus was confirmed in an additional experimental system. Plasma samples were incubated with adenoviruses in the presence of EGTA. The calcium-binding capacity of EGTA blocks the antibody-dependent classical pathway of complement activation, whereas the alternative pathway remains unaffected, thus allowing differentiation of both pathways. EGTA blocked the virus-induced complement activation completely (Figure 3 ). These findings reveal that the alternative, ie antibody-independent pathway of complement activation after challenge with adenoviruses, is not relevant in human plasma.",

Therefore the level of induced complement activation will depend on the applied dose and the route of application (local, systemic). After local low-dose adenovirus applications, complement activation can be most likely ignored. However, direct intravascular high dose applications (>5 \u00d7 10 10 particles/kg) might carry an increased risk for the development of adverse inflammatory reactions.",

            "text": "In a previous study in rabbits, we have shown that local application via the portal vein cannot prevent a rapid spread of virus into the circulation. 19 In clinical trials for the treatment of malignant tumors 20 or the correction of monogenetic diseases, 1 doses of up to 3 \u00d7 10 11 particles per kg body weight have been applied by intravascular application via the hepatic artery. Immediately after virus infusion, the blood or blood plasma, respectively, will contain about about 7.5 \u00d7 10 9 viral particles per ml. Higher concentration could be expected at the site of inoculation. A particle concentration of 7.5 \u00d7 10 9 Ad5 particles per/ml induces an average level of complement activation (in anti-Ad antibody carriers) of about 3000 \u00b1 1000 ng C3a-desArg/ml in isolated human plasma. An in vivo level of 3000 ng/ml C3a would bear a high risk for serious inflammation of the vascular bed with subsequent organ damage. Clinical experience regarding serious effects of complement activation is derived from patients suffering from burns or severe injuries. The mobilization of tissue factors from damaged tissue has the potency to induce systemic complement activation. Clinical symptoms of complement-mediated inflammation normally arise in the first days after the initial trauma. Characteristic manifestations are edema and gas exchange disturbances of the lungs (adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) and failure of liver and kidney function (multiple organ failure, MOF). Patients often die not as a direct consequence of the initial accident, but from the subsequent inflammatory immune response. In clinical studies, the plasma values for the onset of these syndromes has been found in the range of 1000 ng C3a-desArg/ml. 15, 21, 22 The in vitro data presented here, only took into account blood-derived inhibitory factors. After in vivo application, additional regulatory mechanisms involving vascular endothelial cells and the reticulo-endothelial system (liver, spleen) will influence complement activation. However, the level of C3a-desArg released after in vitro challenge strongly suggests complement activation to be relevant for in vivo applications, particularly in high-dose intravascular applications in humans.",

Before virus application, the level of all anti-adenoviral antibodies should be determined. Measuring only the titer of neutralizing antibodies provides no information about the total amount of relevant, ie complement-activating antibodies. The individual differences in complement reactivity against adenoviruses (up to a factor of 5) will make it difficult to define a dose threshold which would reliably exclude uncontrolled complement activation. It might be more appropriate to define an individual threshold performing in vitro complement studies with patients' plasma before gene therapy, in a kind of bedside Gene Therapy test to predict the amount of in vivo activation to be expected. Patients showing a strong in vitro reactivity could benefit from appropriate pharmacological measures. Prophylactic steroid treatment will have no influence on the extent of complement activation, but steroids are known to reduce subsequent inflammatory reactions, like cytokine release and macrophage activation. 23,24 C1esterase inhibitors have been proven for many years to be beneficial for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. They are currently tested as a protective measure against complement-mediated inflammatory tissue damage [25] [26] [27] and would help to avoid or reduce adenovirus-induced complement activation.",

A virus plasma level of about 7.5 \u00d7 10 9 particles/ml (which was calculated to be the highest blood level reached during clinical trials in the past) induced an average release of about 3000 ng/ml C3a (baseline levels \u03fd140 ng/ml). Analyzing the nature of anti-adenoviral antibodies showed, that not only antibodies with neutralizing properties (anti-Ad5), but also non-neutralizing anti-adenoviral antibodies are capable of complement activation. This study suggests that complement activation can be ignored in local low-dose applications of recombinant adenoviruses, but warrants attention after systemic application of large viral quantities. In clinical protocols aiming at systemic virus application, measures for monitoring and controlling the complement system should be included on a regular basis. Gene Therapy (2001) 8, 1794-1800.",
