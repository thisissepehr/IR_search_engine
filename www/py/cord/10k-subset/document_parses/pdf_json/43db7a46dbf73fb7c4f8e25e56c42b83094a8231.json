Maintaining a normal body temperature is a first-line, effective strategy to improve hemostasis during massive transfusion. Red cells play an important role in coagulation and hematocrits higher than 30% may be required to sustain hemostasis. In elective surgery patients, a decrease in fibrinogen concentration is observed initially while thrombocytopenia is a late occurrence. In trauma patients, tissue trauma, shock, tissue anoxia and hypothermia contribute to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation and microvascular bleeding. The use of platelets and/or fresh frozen plasma should depend on clinical judgment as well as the results of coagulation testing and should be used mainly to treat a clinical coagulopathy.",

Treatment strategies include the maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion, the correction of hypothermia and anemia, and the use of hemostatic blood products to correct microvascular bleeding. Objectif-: Revoir la physiopathologie de la coagulopathie chez les adultes transfus\u00e9s massivement et auparavant comp\u00e9tents sur le plan h\u00e9mostatique, \u00e0 la fois dans le contexte d'une intervention chirurgicale r\u00e9gl\u00e9e ou \u00e0 la suite d'un traumatisme. Recommander les strat\u00e9gies th\u00e9rapeutiques les plus appropri\u00e9es. M\u00e9thode-: Dans Medline, nous avons cherch\u00e9 les articles traitant de \"massive transfusion,\" \"transfusion,\" \"trauma,\" \"surgery,\"\"coagulopathy\" et \"hemostatic defects.\" Un groupe d'experts a examin\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats. Constatations principales-: La coagulopathie r\u00e9sulte de l'h\u00e9modilution, l'hypothermie, l'usage de produits sanguins fractionn\u00e9s et la coagulation intravasculaire diss\u00e9min\u00e9e. La port\u00e9e clinique des effets des solutions d'hydroxy\u00e9thyl-amidon sur l'h\u00e9mostase n'est toujours pas claire. Le maintien d'une temp\u00e9rature corporelle normale est une strat\u00e9gie de premi\u00e8re intention efficace pour am\u00e9liorer l'h\u00e9mostase pendant la transfusion massive. Les globules rouges sont importants dans la coagulation et des h\u00e9matocrites sup\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 30 % pourraient \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une h\u00e9mostase ad\u00e9quate. Chez les patients en chirurgie r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, une baisse de la concentration de fibrinog\u00e8ne est observ\u00e9e pr\u00e9cocement tandis que la thrombocytop\u00e9nie est plus tardive. Chez les traumatis\u00e9s, le trauma tissulaire, le choc, l'anoxie et l'hypothermie tissulaires contribuent au d\u00e9veloppement d'une coagulation intravasculaire diss\u00e9min\u00e9e et du saignement microvasculaire. L'utilisation de plaquettes et/ou de plasma frais congel\u00e9 d\u00e9pendra du jugement du clinicien ainsi que des r\u00e9sultats des tests de coagulation. La transfusion devra surtout viser le traitement d'une coagulopathie clinique (saignement microvasculaire). Conclusion-: La coagulopathie associ\u00e9e \u00e0 la transfusion massive demeure un important probl\u00e8me clinique. C'est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement complexe, multifactoriel et multicellulaire. Le traitement comprend le maintien d'une perfusion tissulaire ad\u00e9quate, la correction de l'hypothermie et de l'an\u00e9mie et l'usage de produits sanguins h\u00e9mostatiques pour corriger le saignement microvasculaire.

MT is commonly defined as the replacement of one blood mass in a period of 24 hr. A dynamic definition of MT, such as the transfusion of four or more red cell concentrates within one hour when ongoing need is foreseeable, 1 or the replacement of 50% of the total blood volume within three hours, is more relevant in the acute clinical setting. Massively transfused patients will show evidence of defective hemostasis in a high percentage of cases. In this review, the term \"coagulopathy\" is used interchangeably with the more general term \"defective hemostasis\" and encompasses both defects of primary hemostasis (related to platelet function) and coagulopathy (related to alterations of the plasma phase of coagulation).",

Given the variable and complex clinical context, the results of these studies have seldom led to definitive conclusions. Furthermore, factors other than the transfusion strategy, related to trauma itself, may have led to the observed hemostatic abnormalities. 10 Unfortunately, conventional teaching has sometimes failed to appreciate the evolution of transfusion practices and the context in which these were developed. As a result, anesthesiologists may have been led to apply transfusion strategies, e.g., those developed for trauma patients at a time when MWB was available, 5, 11 inappropriately to patient receiving red cell concentrates for massive bleeding during elective surgery.

            "text": "It has long been known that HES solutions interfere with coagulation 19 and that the effects vary according to the dose and type of solution administered. 20 Solutions with a high molecular weight and a high degree of substitution accumulate in the tissues and are responsible for more pronounced hemostatic effects. 21 Abnormal platelet function occurs more frequently after high molecular weight HES. 22 Conversely, HES solutions with a low molecular weight and a lesser degree of substitution are eliminated more rapidly and tend to affect measures of hemostasis less. [23] [24] [25] In addition to their effects on hemostasis, the infusion of large volumes of HES solutions will result in significant hemodilution. The resulting drop in hemoglobin and platelet concentrations may compromise primary hemostasis. In addition, Innerhofer et al. have shown that the administration of HES or modified gelatin in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery results in reduced clot strength due to impaired fibrinogen polymerization and that reduced fibrinogen concentrations might be reached earlier than expected. 26 Adverse events associated with the use of HES solutions for the resuscitation of patients requiring MT have not been reported, inasmuch as the allowed maximal daily dose is not exceeded. 16 A large retrospective study suggested that the use of 6% HES in primary cardiac surgery with CPB may increase bleeding and transfusion requirements, despite the infusion of volumes smaller than the manufacturer's recommended dose. 27 Conversely, large volumes (up to 5 L) have been infused without major complications, 28 but the safety of this practice remains controversial. 29 The clinical significance of the effects of HES solutions on hemostasis remains unclear. It may never be possible to determine precisely the effect of volume replacement in massively transfused patients with ongoing bleeding. In these patients, hemostasis is stressed severely by numerous factors other than the type of non-blood-related iv fluid used for resuscitation and the underlying cause of coagulopathy is difficult to ascertain. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that the use of colloids in trauma patients is not mentioned in the recommendations by the American College of Surgeons. 30 ",

In rabbit arterioles, platelet numbers are highest near the vessel wall 52 and platelets align themselves with their equatorial plane parallel to the vessel wall as they move closer toward the periphery of the vessel. 53 Experimental data have shown that platelets are expelled toward the RBC depleted marginal layer near the tube wall by mutual interaction with erythrocytes. Under these circumstances, the near wall concentration of platelets is enhanced up to about seven times the average concentration. 54 The correlation between the BT and hematocrit levels has been studied experimentally. In non-thrombocytopenic rabbits, the microvascular BT varied inversely with the hematocrit, animals with hematocrit levels above 35% having shorter BTs than animals with hematocrits lower than 35%. 55 In a rabbit model of cyclic arterial thrombosis and clot lysis, Ouaknine-Orlando et al. have shown that decreases in the hematocrit reduced the cyclic arterial thrombosis rate and increased the BT. 46 Interestingly, normalization of the hematocrit caused thrombosis to reappear.",

However, this interaction remained lower than in non-anemic non-thrombocytopenic subjects. 56 Similarly, RBC shorten the BT and control the hemorrhagic diathesis of uremic patients. 57 In humans with a normal renal function and platelet counts over 100,000\u00b7mm -3 , a modest but statistically significant inverse correlation (r = -0.47; P < 0.001) exists between the hematocrit and the BT. 58 Patients with a pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration \u2264 60 g\u00b7L -1 have a greater chance (relative risk 4.07; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 16.2; P = 0.04) of a posttransfusion decrease in BT than patients with a hemoglobin of more than 60 g\u00b7L -1 . 59 Valeri et al. have shown that, in healthy volunteers, an acute 15% reduction in hematocrit produced a 60% increase in the BT while the BT remained normal despite a 32% reduction in platelet count. 60 All this being said, the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear since the relationship between the BT and perioperative blood losses is highly controversial. 60, 61 The hemostatic effects of profound normovolemic hemodilution were investigated in eight patients undergoing surgical correction of idiopathic scoliosis by McLoughlin et al. 62 Abnormal hemostasis developed prior to compromise of global tissue oxygenation suggesting that, in healthy anesthetized subjects, normovolemic hemodilution may be limited more by preservation of normal coagulation. In this report, reinfusion of all collected blood at the end of the procedure did not normalize the PT or the aPTT. Unfortunately, the authors did not describe if the microvascular bleeding (MVB) observed during hemodilution was corrected by increasing the hematocrit. Modified ultrafiltration in pediatric open heart operations has been shown to increase the hematocrit and attenuate the dilutional coagulopathy associated with CPB in infants. 63 Use of modified ultrafiltration to increase the hematocrit to 36-42% reduced the rise in total body water and the need for donor blood in children undergoing open heart surgery. 64 Thus, further investigations into the role of the hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit on hemostasis in massively transfused patients appear warranted. The data presented above tend to support the concept of a minimal hematocrit for optimal hemostasis. At present the optimal hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration to prevent or to initiate treatment of coagulopathy remains unknown. Experimental evidence suggests that relatively high hematocrits, possibly as high as 35%, are required to sustain hemostasis in bleeding patients undergoing MT.",

Impaired hemostasis is most probably multifactorial in origin and results from the adverse hemostatic effect of multiple concurrent coagulation factor deficits combined with variable degrees of anemia and thrombocytopenia. 6 While numerous studies have measured changes in the PT and aPTT in relationship with bleeding and MT, few have examined individual hemostatic factors. In 1979, transfusing MWB to patients who sustained major trauma, massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage or aortic aneurysm rupture, Counts et al. reported that the number of units of blood transfused explained less than 20% of the variance in factors V and VIII and was not related to factor VII, X, XI, XII and fibrinogen levels. The authors concluded that it was not necessary to supplement transfusions of stored, MWB with fresh blood or fresh frozen plasma (FFP). 5 In 1995, using plasma poor red cell concentrates, Hiippala et al. showed that a concentration of fibrinogen of 1.0 g\u00b7L -1 was reached when the blood loss was 1.42 times the calculated blood volume and that blood losses in excess of two blood volumes caused the deficiency of prothrombin, factor V, platelets and factor VII, in this order. 65 These observations were made in ASA physical status I or II patients undergoing elective major urologic or abdominal surgery and, as a result, may not apply to emergent operations or trauma. Nonetheless, they illustrate well the difference between the times when red cell solutions contained significant amounts of plasma and modern component therapy.",

The PT, aPTT and fibrinogen levels were less severely affected and, most important, significant operative bleeding was not encountered in conjunction with these mild dilutional coagulation changes. 7 On average, the platelet count fell below 100,000\u00b7mm -3 after transfusion of 18 units of blood in the study by Counts et al., 5 but slightly less than half (43%) of the variation in platelet counts could be ascribed to the functional relationship between the amount of blood transfused and the platelet count. In a study conducted to determine the efficacy of prophylactic platelet administration to prevent MVB associated with MT, Reed et al. observed that platelet counts were not different between patients who received prophylactic platelet transfusions and those who did not. 4 Further, both groups had higher platelet counts than predicted by a standard washout equation. This finding implies that platelets are being released into the circulation and counteract the effects of dilution. Sequestered platelets can be released from the spleen and the lung, in addition to the premature release of platelets from the bone marrow. Elevated stress hormones and the administration of catecholamines, a situation more likely to occur in the trauma patient, will influence release.",

Finally, in the study by Miller, observed platelet counts did not parallel calculated platelet counts (Figure 2 ). 11 In elective surgery, the situation appears to be quite different, possibly because tissue trauma is more controlled, normovolemia is maintained and blood losses are replaced in a timely manner. In this context, coagulopathy is primarily related to a coagulation factor deficit 3,65 and the role of fibrinogen appears to be preponderant. The deficiency in fibrinogen concentration develops earlier than any other hemostatic abnormality when plasma-poor red cell concentrates and colloid plasma substitutes are used for the replacement of major blood loss. Approximately 90% of the variation in fibrinogen concentration is explained by blood loss and the critical level of 1.0 g\u00b7L -1 is reached when blood losses reach 142% (95% confidence interval 117%-169%) of the calculated blood volume. 65 In this same study, thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count below 50,000\u00b7mm -3 ) was a late occurrence and, to a great extent, quite variable from patient to patient. Murray et al. studied coagulation changes during crystalloid and PRBC replacement of major blood loss during elective surgery. 73 Four out of 12 patients presented a coagulopathy. All patients with inadequate clinical hemostasis had a low platelet count (83,000\u00b7mm -3 or below) and transfusion of platelet concentrates corrected the problem in the two who had fibrinogen concentrations above 1.0 g\u00b7L -1 . Of note, platelet transfusion was ineffective in the two patients with concurrent low fibrinogen concentrations (0.73 and 0.40 g\u00b7L -1 ). The subsequent transfusion of two and four units of FFP (respectively) normalized hemostasis. The report by Ciavarella et al. supports the association between MVB and a low platelet count (below 50,000\u00b7mm -3 ) or a low fibrinogen concentration (below 0.5 g\u00b7L -1 ). 66 Thus, it appears logical to consider that coagulopathy after MT can be a problem resulting from a combined deficit of platelets and fibrinogen. Focusing only on platelet levels or concentrations of specific coagulation factors may not lead to the most appropriate therapeutic approach. D. DIC 1. DEFINITION DIC is an acquired syndrome secondary to the systemic and excessive activation of coagulation. It may be defined by the association of hemostatic defects related to the exaggerated generation of thrombin and fibrin (with or without clinical signs) and the excessive consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. Criteria for the diagnosis of DIC are presented in Table II . The syndrome can be seen in numerous clinical situations and often complicates the management of MT.",

            "text": "In earlier studies of trauma patients, DIC leading to MVB was, apparently, relatively infrequent, occurring for example in one out of 21 patients 11 and three out of 27 patients. 5 In wounded, previously healthy, soldiers requiring MT, DIC was mild and was not associated with clinical bleeding. 7, 11 Recent studies suggest that there is no significant correlation between total units of blood transfused and the severity of impaired hemostasis, suggesting that consumption of coagulation factors and platelets is more important than simple hemodilution. 41, 74, 75 In trauma patients, two major mechanisms are responsible for the occurrence of DIC. The first relates to the nature and to the importance of tissue trauma. The second relates to shock and tissue anoxia. Brain injury is associated with a particularly high incidence of coagulopathy. In the study by Faringer et al., more than 40% of patients with penetrating or blunt trauma with associated brain injuries had abnormal coagulation tests on admission, compared with 0% in patients with blunt trauma but without brain injury. 2 After blunt brain injury, a DIC syndrome secondary to the extravasation of tissue factor can rapidly (within one to four hours after injury) lead to a consumptive coagulopathy that is associated with a high frequency of death. 76 Regarding the importance of tissue trauma, in the absence of massive head injury and pre-existing disease, life-threatening coagulopathy was associated with a pH of less than 7.10, a temperature of less than 34\u00b0C, an injury severity score greater than 25, and a systolic blood pressure of less than 70 mmHg. When all risk factors were present, the incidence of coagulopathy was 98%. 41 At least two studies have attempted to determine which populations of massively transfused patients are most at risk of sustaining DIC. Mannucci et al. studied changes in the hemostatic system in 172 patients undergoing MT for excessive bleeding during or in the early postoperative period after elective, emergent or trauma surgery. Of these, 52 (30%) suffered decompensated DIC and there was no significant relation between the number of whole blood or PRBC units transfused and the values of any variable of hemostasis measured. 77 In a series of 64 patients receiving more than ten units of red cell concentrates during elective or urgent surgical procedures or resuscitation of multiple trauma, Hewson et al. observed that coagulopathy is related to hemodilution initially, but, within three hours, is related to the duration of antecedent hypotension. Thus, on the basis of the available information, it is difficult to determine which patient population (elective or urgent operations, trauma) is most likely to sustain DIC.",

While their use in the context of MT appeared promising, results have, unfortunately, been disappointing. The best known is the thromboelastograph, a device that measures the viscoelastic properties of the clot during its formation and subsequent lysis. In general surgical patients, thromboelastography analysis showed a trend toward increased coagulability with progressive blood loss and contributed to the identification of two patients who required treatment of a coagulopathy. 85 Thromboelastography has a high negative predictive value (82%) for bleeding after routine cardiac surgery, allowing the differentiation between surgical bleeding and coagulopathy. Unfortunately, the positive predictive value of the test is low (41%). 86 More studies will be required to establish its usefulness in the management of MT.",

Figure 3 , by Erber et al., summarizes well the use of blood and non-blood products involved in the resuscitation of a bleeding patient. 94 Initially, crystalloids or colloids are infused to maintain normovolemia. As the percentage of blood volumes lost and replaced increases, PRBC, FFP and platelets will be required, in that order, guided by clinical and laboratory variables. Pharmacological agents are usually administered relatively late in the process [protamine sulfate antagonizes the effect of excess heparin; desmopressin has been used to control hemorrhage, specially after cardiac surgery, with varying success; aprotinin has been suggested in the context of trauma and MT but its use is not supported by any controlled trial; recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is a promising hemostatic agent under investigation but the optimal timing of administration of rFVIIa remains to be determined].

In the average adult, four units of FFP (800 to 1,000 mL) should suffice initially but additional bolus doses should be administered according to ongoing blood losses and transfusions. 6 As shown in Figure 4 , it is important to administer sufficient bolus doses of FFP to maintain adequate concentrations of coagulation factors. Further, using a three compartment dynamic computer simulation, Hirshberg et al. suggest that, in trauma patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage, FFP should be given rapidly (with the first units of PRBC replacement) in order to effectively prevent dilutional coagulopathy. 72 If the fibrinogen concentration remains below 1.0 g\u00b7L -1 despite therapy with FFP, the administration of cryoprecipitate, a concentrated source of fibrinogen, factor VIII, factor XIII and von Willebrand factor may be indicated 95 despite the associated infectious risks (ten to 20 units -containing 5 mL each -will be required).

The pathophysiology is complex and coagulopathy associated with MT requires a multidisciplinary approach involving anesthesiologists, blood bankers, hematologists, laboratory specialists and surgeons. In the trauma patient, DIC secondary to tissue injury and anoxia often complicates the management of MT. As a result, it is often difficult to ascertain the exact cause of MVB. The \"classic\" view that thrombocytopenia is responsible for the majority of bleeding complications in massively transfused patients should be abandoned. 93 As we have seen, decreased levels of platelets and coagulation factors cannot be predicted by dilution alone. Coagulopathy associated with MT and surgery is an intricate, multicellular and multifactorial event. While the interaction between platelets, fibrinogen and red cells is particularly important, the contribution of fluid replacement therapy, hypothermia and coagulation factor deficiency must not be overlooked. Our second objective was to review the evidence for strategies used to manage coagulopathy in both the elective surgical and trauma settings. Whether for elective surgery or for the management of trauma patients, reliable bedside monitors of hemostasis are needed urgently. By assisting clinicians in making the correct diagnosis in a timely manner, monitors will contribute to the optimal use of blood products.",

Yet, two other important consid-erations should be kept in mind. First, it is important to realize that many pre-existing bleeding disorders are clinically silent and only manifest at times of hemostatic stress such as trauma and major surgery. 112 Thus, a postoperative assessment may be warranted in patients with a history or clinical examination suggestive of such a bleeding disorder. Second, in the postoperative period, many of these patients will experience thrombotic complications 112 related to the consumption of coagulation factors associated with DIC. Once the initial, hemorrhagic, phase of coagulopathy is controlled, efforts should be directed towards the prevention of later, potentially disastrous thrombotic complications.

Written by members of the Groupe d'Int\u00e9r\u00eat en H\u00e9mostase P\u00e9riop\u00e9ratoire, we felt the article would be an appropriate contribution to the Group's Supplement on \"The management of bleeding and thrombosis in the perioperative period: the anesthesiologist's perspective\". However, given the relatively short time period elapsed since the initial appearance of the review, we also felt that a revised publication would have been redundant at this time, little new original information having been published in the interim.Nevertheless, one important article on the use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been published recently and warrants additional comment. The article by Boffard et al. reports the results of two parallel randomized, placebo-controlled, doubleblind clinical trials on the use of rFVIIa as adjunctive therapy to control bleeding in severely injured trauma patients. 1 Patients received either rFVIIa (three doses for a total of 400 \u00b5g\u00b7kg -1 ) or an equal volume of placebo and were stratified to blunt or penetrating injury, hence the two trials. The primary endpoint was the total number of red blood cell (RBC) units transfused from start of treatment to 48 hr. Secondary endpoints included requirement for other transfusion products (fresh frozen plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitates); mortality; days on the ventilator and days in the intensive care unit. Safety outcomes included frequency and timing of adverse events, and changes in coagulation laboratory variables. In addition, the authors studied a composite endpoint of death and critical complications [multiple organ failure (MOF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)].",
