Avian influenza is characterized by pronounced activation of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, which perpetuates the inflammatory response, leading to persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome and pulmonary infection in animals and humans. There are currently no specific treatment strategies for avian influenza. Methods: We hypothesized that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) would have beneficial effects in the treatment of H9N2 AIV-induced acute lung injury in mice. Six-to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with 1 \u00d7 10 4 MID 50 of A/HONG KONG/2108/2003 [H9N2 (HK)] H9N2 virus to induce acute lung injury. After 30 min, syngeneic MSCs were delivered through the caudal vein. Three days after infection, we measured the survival rate, lung weight, arterial blood gas, and cytokines in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum, and assessed pathological changes to the lungs. Results: MSC administration significantly palliated H9N2 AIV-induced pulmonary inflammation by reducing chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines levels, as well as reducing inflammatory cell recruit into the lungs. Thus, H9N2 AIV-induced lung injury was markedly alleviated in mice treated with MSCs. Lung histopathology and arterial blood gas analysis were improved in mice with H9N2 AIV-induced lung injury following MSC treatment. Conclusions: MSC treatment significantly reduces H9N2 AIV-induced acute lung injury in mice and is associated with reduced pulmonary inflammation.

However, MSC treatment decreases the expression of these chemokines. We also showed that MSC-treated mice have significantly reduced levels of some inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3) and a corresponding increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10). It is believed that IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 play important roles in the development of ALI [43] . These results are consistent with several previous studies. For example, in Mei's study, treatment with MSCs alone significantly reduced LPS-induced acute pulmonary inflammation in mice [39] .
