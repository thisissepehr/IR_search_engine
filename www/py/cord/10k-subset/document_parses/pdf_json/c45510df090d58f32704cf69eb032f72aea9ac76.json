The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. Case presentation: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. Conclusions: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics.",

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), also known as atypical mycobacteria, are considered widely distributed environmental organisms [2] . NTM are opportunistic pathogens, and the diseases that they cause are related to host factors such as age, immune compromise, chronic diseases and other conditions along with exposure. Different species of NTM can cause pulmonary infection, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infection, lymphatic inflammation and catheter-related bacteraemia [3] [4] [5] . Mycobacterium monacense is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) that was first described in 2006; since then, several studies have reported the isolation of M. monacense from human clinical samples, such as skin, sputum, and soft tissues [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Here, we report the first case of Mycobacterium monacense isolated from the blood culture of a patient with severe pneumonia.",

The patient had a five-year history of epilepsy and usually took oxcarbazepine and topiramate to control symptoms. One day prior, the patient was found unconscious with his face immersed in a small pond and with limb convulsions. Ten minutes later, he was rescued and sent to a basic hospital. The patient's urine volume was decreased, and no improvement was found in dyspnoea after orotracheal intubation. Then, he was sent to our hospital for further treatment. On physical examination at admission, the pulse was 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 142/70 mmHg, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation was 98% with mechanical ventilation. Laboratory evaluation showed a leucocyte count of 23.22 \u00d7 10 9 /L (reference range: 3.5-9.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L) with 88.4% neutrophils (reference range: 45-70%), a C-reactive protein level of 313.04 mg/L (reference range: 0-10 mg/L), and a negative result of an HIV serology test. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 was 259.1 mmHg. A chest radiograph showed diffuse groundglass opacity in both lungs (Fig. 1 ). The head CT showed bilateral frontotemporal lobe softening and hydrocephalus, which were sequelae of craniocerebral trauma surgery 5 years prior. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), epilepsy, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum aspiration were performed immediately at the bedside, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was sent for culture and metagenomic nextgeneration sequencing (mNGS). A blood culture and G test for beta-D-glucan were performed at the same time. The patient received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and was treated with imipenem intravenously as empirical anti-infection therapy.",

Among the nine cases, six strains were isolated from respiratory specimens, and the other clinical specimens were three biopsy samples of skin fistula tissue and hand and skin nodular lesions. The clinical relevance of the isolation was unclarified in half of the cases reported. Here, we report the first case of M. monacense isolated from the blood culture in a patient with severe pneumonia. Drowning injured the patient's lung, and the infection ensued. It was supposed that the patient was co-infected with M. monacense, Klebsiella pneumoniae or other microorganisms. The isolation of M. monacense from blood culture, though it was not detected in BALF NGS and culture, provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics. The absence of M. monacense in BALF NGS might be Acid-fast staining of the strain isolated from blood culture. c. Gram staining of the strain isolated from blood culture attributed to the thick cell wall of the mycobacterium, which is hard to break and extract nucleic acids in routine sequencing tests. Fortunately, the patient underwent more transient bacteraemia than blood dissemination of the bacteria, and the symptoms were controlled after antibiotic treatment. In the subsequent drug susceptibility test, the strain was susceptible to most of the antibiotics recommended, including linezolid and imipenem. Such a case implied that M. monacense, similar to other NTM, is widely present in the environment (for example, in water and soil) and occasionally infects humans, causing pathological conditions. The pathogenic mechanism of this poorly known mycobacterial species deserves further study. ",
