The hypothesis that hand disinfection would prevent transmission of RV was based on a series of previous studies that suggested that direct contact was the predominant mechanism of spread of RV [5] . Studies in the experimental setting suggest that effective prevention of RV infection requires complete eradication of the virus from the hands [11, 12] . Both routine hand washing and ethanol containing hand sanitizers are effective for removal of RV from the hands but have no persistent activity against subsequent hand contamination [7] . A hand treatment that has persistent antiviral activity for some time after application would be expected to be more effective than simply removing the virus present on the hands.",

Compliance with the study regimen, defined as using at least 90% of the predicted volume of hand treatment over the course of the study, was 100%. Post hoc analyses, however, suggested an inverse correlation between the volume of the active hand treatment used and the likelihood of developing a common cold illness.",

In the experimental setting, RV is generally applied to the hands in liquid medium [7, 8] . In the natural setting, virus that contaminates the hands is presumably contained in small particles of nasal secretions. It is possible that the presence of the nasal secretions protects the virus from the action of the hand treatment. This possibility could be investigated in the experimental setting, but detection of such an effect would suggest that a low pH hand treatment for prevention of natural RV infection will not be possible.",

Our results are similarly mixed, although our study was not optimally designed to assess effects on illness because of the potential for introduction of bias due to the fact that the symptom scores are subjective and the subjects were not blinded to the study treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in common cold illness in the volunteers treated with the virucidal hand treatment in the ITT analysis, although this significance was lost with the smaller sample sizes in the PP analysis. The modest effects on illness are not explained by an impact of the treatment on pathogens other than RV. Polymerase chain reaction assays for RSV, coronavirus, and influenza A and B virus were done on RV-negative specimens associated with common cold illnesses, but treatment effects on these other viruses were not demonstrated.",
