Therefore, understanding the microbiome in waterdamaged homes is critical to preventing these illnesses. Few studies have quantified bacterial contamination, especially specific species, in water-damaged homes. We collected air and dust samples in twenty-one low-mold homes and twenty-one high-mold homes. The concentrations of three bacteria/genera, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptomyces sp., and Mycobacterium sp., were measured in air and dust samples using quantitative PCR (QPCR). The concentrations of the bacteria measured in the air samples were not associated with any specific home characteristic based on multiple regression models. However, higher concentrations of S. maltophilia in the dust samples were associated with water damage, that is, with higher floor surface moisture and higher concentrations of moisture-related mold species.

The QPCR assays targeted the 16S rRNA gene in S. maltophilia and Mycobacterium (genus) and the 23S rRNA gene in Streptomyces (genus). Rintala and Nevalainen (2006) chose the 23S rRNA gene as the target gene because it was not possible to find a primer/probe set targeting the 16S rRNA gene that met the criteria of suitability for QPCR assays and specificity at the same time. For the mold analyses, all primer and probe sequences used in the assays can be found online (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2012).

These bacteria have been previously isolated from moisture-damaged building materials (Suihko et al., 2009; Torvinen et al., 2006) . However, in our study, the concentrations of these genera were not correlated with high ERMI homes, even though the geometric means of Streptomyces and Mycobacterium concentrations in our dust samples were higher than means reported in earlier studies (Lignell et al., 2008; Rintala and Nevalainen, 2006; Simoni et al., 2011;  Torvinen et al., 2010) . These variations might have occurred, in part, due to differences in the sampling as well as in the dust processing methodologies, as discussed for Streptomyces in Johansson et al. (2011) . The NIOSH sampler collects particles into three different size fractions, but we found most of these bacteria in the fraction of > 1.8 lm. At first, this may seem surprising because S. maltophilia is a rod-shaped bacterium with length of 0.5-1.5 lm and width of 0.4-0.7 lm (Adamek and Bathe, 2011; de Oliveira-Garcia et al., 2002) and Mycobacterium has rod-shaped vegetative cells with characteristic aerodynamic diameters ranging from~0.7 to 2.0 lm (McCullough et al., 1997; Peccia et al., 2001; Schafer et al., 1998) . Also, Streptomyces grows as a thread-like network of cells from which spore chains of varying length develop. These spores typically have an aerodynamic diameter 1.0 lm (Madelin and Johnson, 1992; Reponen et al., 1996) . Therefore, it appears that the airborne cells of these bacteria are primarily in aggregates > 1.8 lm.
