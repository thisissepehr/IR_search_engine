The viruses were isolated from flocks which suffered from either respiratory disease or nephritis and the majority had not been vaccinated against IBV. Six strains were shown by monoclonal antibodies to differ from H120, Connecticut and Arkansas 99 strains of IBV and also to differ from each other. Four of these strains were serotyped; one (NRZ) was of the Massachusetts serotype, three (HV, NB-90 and TJ) shared a degree of antigenic similarity and were of a serotype that differed from Massachusetts and Connecticut. NB-90 was similar to both Gray and T strains whereas TJ shared some similarity with the T strain. Four strains, HV, NB-90, YY and TJ induced 33, 47, 60 and 90% mortality, respectively, in 3-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens. Clinical signs and post-mortem findings were identical to those induced by the nephropathogenic T strain. Chickens vaccinated with H120 strain, and then challenged with four highly pathogenic strains HV, NB-90, YY and TJ were not protected as determined by both virus isolation and mortality.

Quatre souches, HV, NB-90, YY et TJ, ont induit respectivement 33, 47, 60 et 90% de mortalit\u00e9 chez des poulets SPF \u00e2g\u00e9s de trois semaines. Les signes cliniques et les l\u00e9sions post mortem ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identiques \u00e0 ceux induits par la souche n\u00e9phropathog\u00e8ne T. Les poulets vaccin\u00e9s avec la souche H120 puis \u00e9prouv\u00e9s avec les quatre souches tr\u00e8s pathog\u00e8nes HV, NB-90, YY et TJ, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s comme l'ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 le r\u00e9isolement du virus et la mortalit\u00e9. Les r\u00e9sultats montrent que l'on trouve fr\u00e9quemment dans les troupeaux de volailles en Chine, des souches d'IBV tr\u00e8s pathog\u00e8nes qui induisent des n\u00e9phrites cliniques. Ils confirment aussi les observations terrain en ce qui concerne l'absence de protection conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par les vaccins couramment utilis\u00e9s de la bronchite infectieuse de s\u00e9rotype Massachusetts vis-\u00e0-vis de ces souches n\u00e9phropathog\u00e8nes. St\u00e4mmen, die zwischen 1986 und 1995 in China isoliert wurden Acht Bronchitisvirus (IBV)-St\u00e4mme wurden zwischen 1986 und 1995 aus Broilern und Legeh\u00fchnern in acht verschiedenen Farmen in vier Provinzen in China isoliert. Die Viren wurden aus Herden isoliert, die entweder unter Respirationskrankheiten oder unter Nephritis litten und gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils nicht gegen IBV geimpft worden waren. Bei sechs St\u00e4mmen wurde mit Hilfe von monoklonalen Antik\u00f6rpern nachgewiesen, da\u00df sie sich von den IBV-St\u00e4mmen H120, Connecticut und Arkansas99 sowie auch untereinander unterschieden. Vier dieser St\u00e4mme wurden serotypisiert; einer (NRZ) war vom Serotyp Massachusetts, drei (HV, NB-90 und TJ) teilten eine gewisse Antigen\u00e4hnlichkeit und geh\u00f6rten einem Serotyp an, der sich von Massachusetts und Connecticut unterschied. NB-90 war den St\u00e4mmen Gray und T \u00e4hnlich, w\u00e4hrend TJ eine gewisse \u00c4hnlichkeit mit dem Stamm T hatte. Vier St\u00e4mme, und zwar HV, NB-90, YY und TJ, verursachten bei drei Wochen alten spezifisch-pathogenfreien K\u00fcken eine Mortalit\u00e4t von 33%, 47%, 60% bzw. 90%. Die klinischen Symptome und die Sektionsbefunde waren mit denen identisch, die durch den nephropathogenen Stamm T verursacht wurden. K\u00fcken, die mit dem Stamm H120 vakziniert und danach mit den vier stark pathogenen St\u00e4mmen HV, NB-90, YY und TJ testinfiziert wurden, waren nicht gesch\u00fctzt, was sowohl durch Virusisolierungen als auch durch die Mortalit\u00e4t festgestellt wurde. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, da\u00df stark pathogene IBV-St\u00e4mme, die eine klinische Nephritis verursachen, in Gefl\u00fcgelbest\u00e4nden in China h\u00e4ufig vorkommen. Sie best\u00e4tigen auch Praxisbeobachtungen \u00fcber den mangelnden Impfschutz durch die zur Zeit verwendeten IB-Vakzinen vom Serotyp Massachusetts gegen die Infektion mit diesen nephropathogenen St\u00e4mmen.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "We thank Professor Xu Yiwei and Yu Kangzhen of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute and Dr Trevor Bagust for their contribution.
