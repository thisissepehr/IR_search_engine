In the last few decades, VL outbreaks claimed hundreds of lives in the region both in the previously endemic and nonendemic areas [4] [5] [6] .

Amhara, Tigray, Southern nation nationalities and peoples, Oromia and Somali region are at high risk of VL transmission in the country [7] .

The main drugs available for the treatment of VL are antimony compounds, sodium stibogluconate (SSG) and meglumine antimoniate (glucatim), Liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome), paromomycin and now the oral drug miltefosine. The current first line treatment for VL in Ethiopia is a combination of antimonial with aminoglycosides (SSG and Paromomycin), SSG or glucatim (Monotherapy) and paromomycin and Liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome) in special situations like pregnant women. Liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome), Miltefosine and Paromomycin (Aminosidine) are second-line treatment for primary VL. The drugs available are not only prohibitively expensive for the most affected, but also are associated with severe side effects. Thus, early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for VL treatment and control. The diagnostic approaches include the direct methods; microscopy, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the indirect ones, the patient produce an immune response to the L. donovani, the agent causing of VL in East Africa, are direct agglutination test (DAT), rK39 immuno-chromatographic test (ICT), and indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) [9] . Most of the direct methods involve invasive and technically demanding sampling procedures and/or processing steps that need specialized training and expensive set-ups. Thus, their use in most endemic settings are hardly possible. Of the indirect method, DAT and rK39-ICT are less technically demanding and involve minimally invasive sampling procedures. They are the most widely validated tools in the Ethiopian endemic area [10] [11] [12] [13] . Among them, DAT was shown to be more sensitive, specific and reproducible [12, 13] . The production technique of the DAT antigen is not patented, and elsewhere the use of local strains of VL causing strain makes it even more sensitive and specific [14, 15] . Yet, the national program is highly dependent on foreign aid to purchase DAT and this leads for unnecessary delays due to import regulations and processes.

Moreover, the high cost and severe side effects associated with the available chemotherapeutic options made the value for prompt and accurate diagnosis unquestionable [3, 17, 18] . However, the VL endemic East African countries, including Ethiopia lack sufficient capacity and resource for the purchase of diagnostic supplies, thus their control programs are donor dependent. The national neglected tropical disease programs, Ethiopian federal ministry of health recommended rK39-ICT at the primary health care center and DAT, and Microscopy at district and tertiary hospitals as a diagnostic tool for VL [19] . Yet accessibility is limited due to delays related to import regulations and processes, late ordering, intermittent stock outs even in the referral setups. Thus, in this study, we produced whole cell DAT antigen in liquid using MHOM/ET/67/L82 L. donovani strain and assessed performance comparing it with validated commercial kits; FD-DAT (ITMA-DAT/VL, Belgium) and rK39-ICT (InBios International Kalazar DetectTM Rapid test kit, The Netherlands). Our in-house AQ-DAT had a sensitivity (97.3%) comparable to FD-DAT (99.1%) and rK39-ICT (96.5%), taking microscopy as gold standard. This is similar to a study done in Sudan in which AQ-DAT, FD-DAT, and rK39 showed a sensitivity of 99, 95.8, and 79.2%, respectively [14] . Similarly, studies conducted in Brazil and Sudan documented better sensitivity of FD-DAT (98-100%) compared to rK39-ICT (85.7-90%) [20, 21] . In contrast, another study from the Northeast of Sudan showed, lower sensitivity for FD-DAT (84%) compared with rK39-ICT (93%) [22] .
