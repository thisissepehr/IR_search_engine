Since they were not cured by conventional immunosuppressive, they all met the creation for refractory JDM. Till now, it is very difficult to treat refractory JDM. Many researchers have contributed to find out new treatment. In 2011, Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO) studied 145 patients with recentonset JDM and 130 patients with one disease flare. It found out that cyclosporine and IVIG were preferred for treating relapse in Europe [12] . In 2012, the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) put forward three consensus protocols, including steroids, methotrexate and IVIG, in order to optimize the baseline standard therapy for patients with moderate to severe JDM [13] . However, those medications have unavoidable toxic side effects, such as weight gain, growth delay, gonadoinhibitory and so on. Therefore, we would like to find out a new way to cure refractory JDM, based on its possible pathogenesis. Although the aetiology of JDM remains unclear, current theories propose a combination of environmental triggers, immune dysfunction and specific tissue responses as possible causes [14] . Many literatures point out that JDM is a true inflammatory small vessel vasculitis, and cytokines, such as interferons and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, play an important role in the pathogenesis [1, 15] . Besides, literatures showed AHSCT was safe for children [7, 16] . Therefore, we thought that autologous HSCT might be effective and safe for refractory JDM. Autologous HSCT was first reported to treat DM/PM in 2000 [17] . Until now, only 11 cases were reported (Table 1) , and 5 of them were children. All of these patients had tried a lot of conventional drugs before HSCT and some of them tried biotherapy (4 cases used rituximab, 2 cases used infliximab, 1 case used alemtuzumab) without any improvement. All of our three patients had tried conventional medicatons for 6 to 31 months before HSCT, but none of them used biologics. During 2005-2008, biologics was rarely used in China, and its efficacy in dermatomyositis is not confirmed [15] .Therefore, our three patients did not try biologics. [4] [5] [6] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . After AHSCT, 13 cases had improved (13/14) , and only one case (1/14) did not. There was no death.
