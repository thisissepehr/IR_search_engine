However, the tendency to concentrate on the influence of \"risk factors\" related to living and working conditions of individuals, rather than to more broadly examine dynamics of the social processes that affect population health, has triggered critical reaction not only from the Global North but especially from voices the Global South where there is a long history of addressing questions of health equity. In this article, we elaborate on how focusing instead on the language of \"social determination of health\" has prompted us to attempt to apply a more equity-sensitive approaches to research and related policy and praxis. Discussion: In this debate, we briefly explore the epistemological and historical roots of epidemiological approaches to health and health equity that have emerged in Latin America to consider its relevance to global discourse. In this region marked by pronounced inequity, context-sensitive concepts such as \"collective health\" and \"critical epidemiology\" have been prominent, albeit with limited acknowledgement by the Global North. We illustrate our attempts to apply a social determination approach (and the \"4 S\" elements of bio-Security, Sovereignty, Solidarity and Sustainability) in five projects within our research collaboration linking researchers and knowledge users in Ecuador and Canada, in diverse settings (health of healthcare workers; food systems; antibiotic resistance; vector borne disease [dengue]; and social circus with street youth).",

We conclude that this language leads to more direct analysis of the systemic factors that drive, promote and reinforce disparities, while at the same time directly considering the emancipatory forces capable of countering negative health impacts. It follows that \"reverse innovation\" must not only recognize practical solutions being developed in low and middle income countries, but must also build on the strengths of the theoretical-methodological reasoning that has emerged in the South.",

However, there remains a strong tendency for public health practitioners and traditional epidemiologists to continue to concentrate on the influence of \"risk factors\" related to living and working conditions of individuals, rather than to more systematically address the social dynamics that affect population health. This persistence has triggered critical reaction from voices not only in the Global North (e.g. [2] [3] [4] ) but especially in the Global South [5] [6] [7] where there has been a long history of examining the social processes impeding healthy living (buen vivir) [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In this article, we discuss how adopting a language that focuses more directly on the social processes underlying health inequities can prompt a different approach to research and related policy and praxis. We see this discursive change in line with Bourdieu's recognition of the \"symbolic power\" associated with how science is invoked at any given time as an expression of social and political relations [13] . By focusing on how a language that has been developed more extensively in the Global South can inform empirical research in global health, we seek to extend the \"reverse innovation\" debate that has been raised in the Globalization and Health journal.",

Joining colleagues from the Global North who also call for more comprehensively concentrating on systemic power relations (e.g. [2] [3] [4] ), researchers from the Global South have been arguing for shifting our attention to social processes (e.g. [16] ), and indeed shifting our language from \"social determinants\" to the processes of the \"social determination\" of health [SDnH] ( [17] [18] [19] [20] ).",

The emergence in Latin America of a different conceptualization of \"health equity\" has scarcely taken place in a vacuum. After all, in an increasingly globalized world marked by growing power asymmetries, the tendency in mainstream thinking to uncritically apply conceptual and epistemological framings dominant in \"Northern\" settings has undervalued understandings that have emerged in the Global South [21, 25] . This has been well recognized by the editors of Globalization and Health in their explicit call for learning from the South [26] . Crisp [27] , noting that \"there is still relatively little reverse flow of ideas and approaches from lower to higher income institutions\" (p.2), echoes the arguments of Barrios Suarez et al. [28] lamenting the typical North to South direction of global health knowledge rather than a truly reciprocal bidirectional flow.

This is accompanied by a brief discussion of the nature of the \"health equity/social determinants of health\" dominant framing and the parallel work that has been taking place on the \"social determination\" of health conceptualization, briefly comparing and contrasting the two. Here we point to why language that re-focuses on the social processes (or SDnH) is more likely to lead to insights and actions that contribute to sustainable health equity. Such critical social theory considerations are especially pertinent in South-north global health research collaborations where teams are working together in participatory action research and other participatory empirical studies. As such, our Ecuadorian-Canadian partnership [29] provides an excellent opportunity to contribute to this analysis. In this context we introduce our long-standing (now decade long) international collaborative research program that currently addresses five quite distinct population health problems and settings, (health of healthcare workers; food systems; antibiotic resistance; vector borne disease [dengue]; and social circus with street youth), illustrating our attempts to apply the rich social theory from Latin America into the empirically rich participatory research we are conducting in diverse contexts. We conclude by reflecting on the broad epistemological and empirical challenges as well as opportunities that are presented in pursuing North-south collaborations.",

Despite the origins of public health being thoroughly rooted in profound appreciations of social and political contexts (Virchow, Engels) as described by Birn for example [4] , the insights provided by breakthroughs in biological and medical sciences led by the emergence of germ theory in the late 19th century set the stage for new approaches. Importantly, while the evolution of epidemiological study prompted the development of increasingly sophisticated and powerful statistical and design techniques for measuring associations of exposure and disease, such \"success\" served to marginalize more theoretically-rich interdisciplinary -let alone transdisciplinary and intercultural -approaches to understanding the determination of disease in populations. Recognizing the challenges that tended to have been relatively ignored by mainstream \"risk factor\" epidemiology, new orientations and scientific paradigms related to social epidemiology and population health began to emerge in the Global North in the latter half of the twentieth century, cognizant of the intensifications of complexity-rooted effects and disparities that were being generated by ever intensified social changes (e.g. see the work of Krieger [31, 32] ).",

Specifically, in Latin America over the course of the Twentieth Century, the visible signs of extreme social and political authoritarianism and inequity, as well as the growing unfairness of the world economy, inspired a culture of social critique -and a corresponding academic reform movement related to health research began to be entrenched in major public universities in Latin America. It was no coincidence that this tendency paralleled the innovative orientation to learning prompted by Paolo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed in response to formalistic approaches to learning and in search of social justice [33] . Such circumstances nurtured a profound social awareness among health scientists whose academic or public health roles placed them in direct contact with the devastating effects of poverty. This is the controversial trajectory under which epidemiology developed in Latin America since the late 1970s, transforming from a basic knowledge formation built around certain processes to a discipline constructed around partially defined objects, to finally becoming a science structured around clearly defined objects of study [34] . As various North American scholars noted, however, \"two of the most significant developments in health scholarship and practice of our era -the social medicine and critical epidemiology movements in Latin America\" [35] , were remaining largely unknown in the North. In fact, there has been limited direct interchange between the scholarship in the South and the more counter-hegemonic expressions of epidemiology in the Global North [22] . As such, the timing remains overripe for pursuing active collaborations, such as the partnership in which we are engaged, as discussed below.",

In this way, attention is directly drawn not only to systematically consider the health effects associated with \"determinants\", but also to consider the processes whereby those who are affected also respond to these circumstances, within and across scales. In this sense, those affected are considered as subjects whose agency is directly part of the theoretical conceptualization. In contrast, using the language of SDH and conventional epidemiology, interventions can focus on identified risk factors. The agency of those affected by these determinants tends to be relatively secondary in such analyses, and added as a caveat to consider, as per Solar and Irwin's cautions [15] , rather than as central to the conceptual design of the relationships under consideration.",

In other words, as illustrated by Figure 1 , our SDnH approach more directly promotes consideration of iii) processes that may be supportive of \"emancipation\" and health equity (potentially challenging hegemonic status quo social relations); and iv) the forces that drive and influence relationships and determinants themselves, over and above a role in \"determining the distribution of these causes between more and less advantaged groups\" as per the SDH conceptual framing [15] .",

Assessment of whether mezzo-level modes of living are healthy or unhealthy can accordingly be considered not only by deciphering positive and negative associations linking \"health outcome\" and determinant indicatorsbut to directly consider interactions with the 4 S processrelated dimensions, again keeping in mind that the relationships are dynamic and not static. This includes consideration of how social actors retain their capacities to resist hegemonic systemic forces (Sovereignty) that may undermine the integrity of their health as well as the capacity to effectively orchestrate a collaborative organic (Solidarity) response in line with their social character. It also recognizes that certain systemic forces that deviate from more organic self-regulating processes can imperil life-supporting systems (Sustainability)to negatively affect health security (Bio-Security) through resulting imbalances as well as the introduction of threats associated with newly introduced technologies.",

This joint occupational health-infection control team worked together not only in Canada but also in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) [49] [50] [51] ; and in 2007 worked with colleagues in Ecuador to develop guidance documents and launch capacity building workplace initiatives [52] . A specific area of health concern for health workers globally, and especially in LMICs with a relatively high prevalence and incidence rate of tuberculosis (TB) in the general population, particularly given the increased risk of multiple and extremely drug resistant TB (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) in such settings [53] was indeed the control of infectious disease transmission to healthcare workers. Co-author AY had led the development of new international guidelines for health workers that have been adopted by the WHO, International Labour Organization and UNAIDS [54] , and headed a research program in this area (Promoting Health Equity by Addressing the Needs of Health Workers: A Collaborative, International Research Program) [49, 50, 55] . However, while the team recognized the negative impact of global economic forces on health of health workers and public health sector infrastructure [56] [57] [58] and built this into their research grant application, until the concerted effort was guided by an understanding of social determination of health, inadequate attention was paid in the operationalizing of these various North-south collaborative action research projects to the social processes driving inadequacies in these areas. As the Ecuadorian government sought to strengthen the public health system in response to years of neglect, the opportunity for improving working conditions emerged as an area to be addressed by the Canadian-Ecuadorian collaboration, and a decision was made to explicitly attempt to put the theoretical richness of an SDnH approach of health into practice.",

In the context of this background, our research program is focusing on strengthening occupational health and infection control while building capacity to address the problematic nature of work organization and work relations in this setting. Focusing not merely on identifying risks in the work environment, developing policies and procedures to address these, and training health workers to properly implement these measures, the SDnH approach adopted focuses more directly on contextualizing the work setting and hospital management dynamics within an understanding of global and national economic and political forces. Moreover, the research activity reflects the principles of participatory action research [59, 60] . Thus the project revolved around working with health workers to develop their own abilities to identify unhealthy working conditions. The SDnH approach examines individual circumstances (micro domain) but framed within an understanding of the conditions associated with the group to which the participants belong (mezzo domain), and projects these understandings towards promoting changes within institutions and social organizations influencing these domains (macro level). The resulting integrated framework has been guiding us in devising policies and procedures that take into consideration work organization and social hierarchies, directly considering preventive approaches that could be taken up in advocacy for promoting greater health equity. We are currently in the process of implementing research in Ecuador that embraces this latter approach, incorporating the technical expertise acquired by our team in Canada [61, 62] , South Africa [50, 55] and beyond [51] , with the extensive existing expertise in Ecuador in occupational health and infection control. Building \"agency\" through facilitating the creating and strengthening of grassroots networks is a key aspect of the strategy being adopted. Importantly, attention to the 4 S's has been guiding the conceptualization and research process, as shown in Table 1 .",

As a result, this area was identified as a priority domain for our team's attention, especially in light of the prominent attention to food sovereignty in the 2007-08 process of adopting a new constitution in Ecuador. We therefore linked this focus with food system and health concerns being experienced in Canada to provide an opportunity to explore interconnections in a global food system. To better understand ways to promote health equity and healthy living in response to dominant processes associated with producing, distributing and consuming food globally, we assembled Canadian and Ecuadorian teams of researchers and knowledge users to stimulate thinking about strategies for advancing research on global, national and local scales when faced with complexity, through a five-year research program co-led by co-authors JS and JB (Food systems and health equity in an era of globalization: Think, Eat and Grow Green Globally [TEG3]) [63] .",

While strong proportions of the literature in both languages that cite \"food\" and \"health\" explicitly invoke the language of \"food security\", identification of \"food sovereignty\" was revealed by a cursory Google Scholar review as 4-fold greater in Spanish. The different epistemological traditions in fact led to different conceptual frameworks for initiating this exercise in each setting, prompting us to critically reflect on the significance of the conceptual framings we were applying. The English-language review [64] was initiated with reference to identifying distinct pathways (or constellations of determinants) that influence health equity and suggest areas for intervention, while the Spanish language review was organized with reference to relationships to the 4 S's with more direct focus on processes that affect healthy living. In both orientations, social class influences on nutritious food access were observed to be of particular importance. Sustainability concerns related to climate change and multiple food contaminants (framed as \"bio-security\" in Spanish) such as agro-toxins (commonly referred to as pesticides in English), animal antibiotic use or genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) were also flagged by knowledge users in both settings as requiring more attention. A further synthesis integrating and contrasting the two epistemological orientations is currently underway, linking researchers and knowledge user partners in Ecuador and Canada.",

This entails systematic identification of pathways, estimation of effect and evaluation of impact prompted by consideration of 4 S concerns. Modeling and sensitivity estimations will provide a basis for considering and comparatively analysing results.

A risk-factor-oriented SDH approach typically restricts its focus more narrowly. In contrast, in pursuing an SDnH approach, as shown in Table 2 , we are linking access to food to meet the nutritional requirements of marginalized populations with concerns about agrochemical contamination in a direct attempt to build solidarity for actions to achieve sustainable and bio-secure food sovereignty. For example, while pesticide use in the Global South may help reduce the cost of buying bananas by residents of inner city communities in the Global North, this would not be in keeping with the 4S's in that such achievements would be realized by exposing workers and communities to increased toxic exposures. The SDnH approach thus calls for the building of solidarity between North and South to recognize the lack of sustainability of this approach, questioning implications of capital accumulation by large multinational food corporations. Trends in increased health expenditures and improved access to healthcare have been identified as linked to political processeswith impacts on working conditions of health workers documented empirically. Health effect associations with organizational, environmental and individual work patterns are being revealed using multi-methods research techniques and placed in a micro-mezzo-macro framework to guide integrated interventions at different levels.",

This led to widespread misuse of antibiotics that are contributing to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, fueled by poverty and poor living conditions [66, 67] aggravated by widespread agro-industrial non therapeutic application of antibiotics in animal husbandry [68] [69] [70] .

What we found was that not only were the surveillance systems not in place to collect the needed data to evaluate the effectiveness of our interventions, but that these measures fail to capture concepts such as good living or Sumak Kawsay (in Kichwa), that come from the wisdom of an Indigenous worldview. Within the latter epistemology, success is defined by perceived healthy and sustainable relationships between living organisms, with a focus on process, mutual respect, and reverence for the autonomy of othersprocesses that address the root of the structural problem, locally, nationally and internationally.",

Other researchersboth in the Global North and Global South, of course, have also approached the issue of antibiotic resistance with attention to underlying drivers. As noted above, Cole and Wing, for example, documented the impact of concentrated animal feeding operations on antimicrobial resistance [68] . We therefore linked antimicrobial resistance, and the health hazard this presents to humans, to the underlying manner in which food is now being produced, in addition to well-documented profit-seeking behaviour of pharmaceutical companies [75] . A traditional SDH approach emphasizes education on hand hygiene, sanitation, clean water, and infection control measures such as cough etiquette, as well as knowledge on the difference between viruses and bacteria, as some of our team members had done in Canada, operating under a different paradigm [76] . In contrast, the SDnH approach we decided to adopt in our Ecuador work, while providing the necessary information found in the \"Do bugs need drugs?\" Canadian manual, also explicitly focuses on raising awareness of the reasons for the emergence (or social production) of antimicrobial resistance, and embraces an intercultural approach to healthpromoting living in harmony with nature and all the organisms of the ecosystem, as well as encouraging community mobilization to demand that basic needs are met. As such, the intercultural booklet embracing an ecosystem approach to antimicrobial resistance that we produced working collaboratively with indigenous communities, government departments, the Pan American Health Organization, and university partners in Ecuador, while providing practical advice, does not shirk from identifying the social processes that perpetuate the transmission of infectious diseases and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Although we had intended to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the use of the booklet by Community Health Promoters within a cluster-randomized trial in communities across Ecuador, the contextual reality precluded proper implementation. Some of the challenges related to changes in personnel within the Ministry of Health, as well as the realization that the surveillance systems did not exist for capturing data on antimicrobial use, let alone on trends in resistance, leaving us with only process measures (as well as knowledge, attitudes and self-reported practice) to serve as outcome to measure quantitatively. We therefore set out to build the infrastructural capacity, while promoting the use of the material, leaving rigorous evaluation to a future date. Traditional epidemiology would consider this study a failure; however, the research process itself brought together communities, non-governmental organizations, national government and international agencies, serving to raise the level of awareness and conferring some empowerment to serve as a basis for future challenges to detrimental social processes.

Analysis comparing the application of these indices with observations using the impressionistic social class designations of other studies revealed a significantly greater validity of INSOC in providing an evidence-based means for examining the social ecology (stratified as \"high\", \"medium\" and \"low\" [77] ). For example, distinct social gradient relationships by INSOC social class designations (in contrast to impressionistic categorization) were observed with regard to housing quality and the type of water containers at greatest risk for dengue infestation. We are now proceeding to extend this analysis more broadly to 2011 Ecuador census data which provides sufficient data to construct INSOC variables. Using this, we will then delineate the kinds of interventions that can benefit from this more sensitive approach to social characterization, noting the limits that behaviour adaptation interventions can offer in comparison to the pursuit of broader structural and infrastructural transformations.",

This question began to be posed by our team when Cirque du Soleil began in 2011 to implement a government-sponsored social circus program to promote healthy social policy. Ecuador's Vice President, with a particular interest in humour and the arts, made this one of his flagship initiatives in a national public program, reaching many thousands of participants. The program focuses on street youth, but also includes programs for children from marginalized populations. We therefore decided to explore how social circus can influence the social determination of health. In addition to participant observer methods, focus groups, interviews and questionnaire surveys, we are incorporating participatory arts-based methods (such as photovoice [91] ) to engage the participants themselves in the research process not as subjects of the research but as active members of the research team. We are considering if roles are stereotyped and participation mitigated by sex and gender, for example; we will be considering the power differentials in social circus programs; and we will be developing a much-needed theoretical approach to understanding how the use of circus arts by marginalized populations can challenge the social processes perpetuating their marginalization [79] , to the extent they chose to do so [92] .

Secondly, these same forces have stimulated the development of counter-hegemonic responses in all cases, and this is explicitly recognized and incorporated in the research. Thirdly, the focus of each of these research initiatives is not merely on addressing the proximal processes threatening health -i.e. the specific SDH in question (e.g. poor infection control in hospitals, lack of nutrition, misuse of antibiotics, vector-borne diseases, or alienation of marginalized youth), but rather the social processes that could be challenged in a manner that would empower communities (including workforces) to address underlying power relations. In this way, the SDnH approach we are endeavouring to apply in our work aims at the processes that drive social inequities, not merely the effects of these inequities, while at the same time directly considering the resistant (liberatory) forces capable of countering negative health impacts.

Indeed in many Northern schools of population health (including the home base of authors AY and JS), advanced skills in statistical techniques are required for a doctoral degree by all students regardless of their topic or preferred methods of research, while no such emphasis is placed on critical theory. Certainly medical students in the faculty in which AY and JS work are often completely unfamiliar with the social processes underlying poverty [56] , while they learn that randomized controlled trials with sophisticated statistical techniques are the required standard of evidence for interventions to be deemed effective. Emphasis on such relatively narrow standards of proof has prompted Schrecker [97] to provocatively query \"Can health equity survive epidemiology?\"and conclude that it is essential to consider and pursue broader approaches (methodological pluralism). In contrast, at the home base of Southern author JB, familiarity with emancipatory theory is a core requirement for doctoral studies in the collective health program, while statistical skills are only required of those who intend to use such techniques in their theses. Our collaborative research is attempting to apply both advanced epidemiological techniques as well as social theory. Our point, however, is that the language of social determinants (especially in its simplistic form, with limited differentiation made between immediate and structural determinants) lends itself to research that is more reductionist and hence beckons the development of different skills than would be applied by those who adopt the language of social determination.",

Embrett and Randall [98] suggest that a reason for this can be found in the failure to adequately integrate and apply a thorough understanding of policy analysis theory. While we strongly agree that attention to policy theory can contribute to more effective interventions, we argue that there is a more fundamental need to strengthen our grasp of the processes that drive health inequities and capacities for addressing them. Our experience illustrates that we do indeed need a sharper theoretical focus in guiding empirically-rich intervention research, but this theory must look not at discrete social determinants of health, but rather to comprehend and then address the critical processes of social determination that systemically drive disparities. This sharper focus is needed in order to promote the conceptualization and operationalizing of intervention research in a manner that could be more transformative.",

Traditional epidemiology has also much to learn from them, about integral notions of space, sustainable relations between nature and humanity, a healthy conception of time, a harmonious management of the planet's energies and about a fair, equitable and protective construction of social relations. Therefore, it is not surprising, to observe the proximity in meanings of the indigenous Kichwa word 'Sumak Kawsay' (good living) which has been established as a central concept within the new Ecuadorian constitution adopted through popular processes in 2008 with our academic conceptions of 'healthy mode of life'.",

The failure to have adequately embraced insights emerging from all corners of the globe undermines the benefits that this can bring to world knowledge -and risks contributing to \"epistemicides\" that marginalize alternative forms of knowledge [101] . Prominent Brazilian epidemiologist Cesar Victora even conjectured that strategies to break the underrepresentation of such contributions from the \"South\" are themselves needed [102] , in line with Raewyn Connell's observation that with few exceptions, \"mainstream social theory sees and speaks from the global North\" [103] . Notwithstanding the difficulties we encountered in operationalizing research in line with our social theory, we argue that there is much to gain from pursuing collaborations that concurrently promote the strengths of design and methodology that have been spawned by conventional epidemiology from the North with the epistemological and theoretical insights developed particularly from the Latin American collective health theorists.",
