The logistic problems of generating a pandemic vaccine from scratch, conducting preclinical testing, and producing billions of doses within a few months for global distribution are enormous and may well be insurmountable.

The most common and serious infections of humans are caused by influenza A virus.

In general, influenza A virus infections are self-limiting in healthy human adults, and mainly cause life-threatening disease in the very young and in the elderly. Notwithstanding, this depends on the circulating type. Aquatic birds serve as the main reservoir of influenza A viruses and carry all of the known subtypes (H1-16, N1-9) without necessarily developing disease upon infection. The virus can adapt to other species such as poultry, pigs, horses, or humans.

Point mutations that cause gradual changes are referred to as antigenic drift, and allow the virus to evade protective neutralizing antibody responses induced by previous infections. Most annual epidemics are caused by antigenic drift variants. Rearrangements of the HA-or NA-encoding gene segments between viral types circulating in humans and those endemic in animals result in more dramatic changes, also called antigenic shifts, and the pandemics of 1957 with H2N2 and 1968 with H3N2 were caused by such new types of influenza virus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a pandemic is the emergence of a serious new disease caused by an agent that spreads easily among humans. WHO recommends three measures to lessen the impact of the next influenza virus pandemic: (1) increased surveillance to allow for the earliest possible warning that a human pandemic has started; (2) early intervention to stall global spread and prevent further adaptations; and (3) development of an effective pandemic vaccine.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Available vaccines against influenza virus are seasonal vaccines that are updated annually to incorporate the latest circulating viruses.

This pandemic was caused by an H1N1 virus and is paradoxically and unfairly referred to as the Spanish Flu. The pandemic that started in March of 1918 and lasted until June of 1920 killed half a million Americans and somewhere between 50 and 100 million humans worldwide (Johnson and Mueller 2002) . This virus infected nearly 50% of the population and killed 2.5% of all of those that became infected. It is estimated that 25 million people died during the first 25 weeks of the pandemic. Death rates were high in humans between the ages of 20-40, an age group which generally recovers easily from influenza A virus infection. During the initial stages of the pandemic, the early symptoms of infection, which included hemorrhages and lung edema followed by death within 24-48 h, were commonly misdiagnosed. The severity of the symptoms is assumed to have been caused by an excessive release of cytokines in response to the virus (Kash et al. 2004) , which was most severe in healthy adults with sturdy immune systems. The 1918 H1N1 virus was recently isolated from victims preserved in permafrost, and upon sequencing the virus was rederived through genetic engineering . This allowed for an extensive characterization of the virus using modern tools of science. The 1918 H1N1 virus has several distinct features that may explain its unique virulence. Most types of influenza A virus require trypsin-like enzymes for cleavage of the viral HA, which in turn restricts their cellular tropism. The NA of the H1N1 virus of 1918 can directly or indirectly cleave HA, thus rendering this virus independent of trypsin-like enzymes (Steinhauer 1999) . Increased virulence was further enabled by NS proteins, which allow the virus to disable the interferon (IFN) pathway (Seo et al. 2004 ), a crucial component of both innate and adaptive immunity. Human-to-human transmission, a prerequisite for a human pandemic, appears to have involved a switch in preferential binding of the HA protein from a-2,3 sialic acid found in the avian enteric tract to a -2,6 sialic acid present in the human respiratory tract ). This altered receptor binding activity can be achieved experimentally through a single amino acid exchange at position 190 of the HA of the 1918 H1N1 subtype. Additional changes in the viral PB and PB2 proteins, which contain four amino acids that are conserved in human viruses and that differ from those prevalent in avians, are likely to have affected transmission between humans (Russell and Webster 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 457, "end": 483, "text": "(Johnson and Mueller 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1134, "text": "(Kash et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1828, "text": "(Steinhauer 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1949, "end": 1965, "text": "(Seo et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 2672, "end": 2698, "text": "(Russell and Webster 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Spanish Flu"}, {"text": "The 1957 pandemic, also referred to as the Asian Flu, originated from a recombination between a circulating human virus and a virus endemic in ducks.

A few months after mass vaccination had started, reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in vaccine recipients started to accumulate, and by early 1977 (when vaccination was stopped) more than 500 cases of GBS had been reported, 25 of which were fatal (Langmuir et al. 1984 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 607, "end": 628, "text": "(Langmuir et al. 1984", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Swine Flu"}, {"text": "A highly pathogenic form of avian H5N1 virus was first detected in Asian poultry in 1997 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1997) .

The virus rapidly caused pneumonia and multiple organ failure in infected individuals, which were mainly young adults. Culling of infected flocks of poultry initially appeared to have stopped further spread, but then in 2003 additional human cases with a similar H5N1 virus were recorded in Vietnam (Tran et al. 2004 (Steel et al. 2008; Cristalli and Capua 2007) . Other countries rejected the idea of bird vaccination due to fears that this may mask infections and allow for further mutations that may promote human transmissibility. Similar to the 1918 H1N1 virus, pathogenic H5N1 virus activates HA through a trypsin-independent mechanism (Hulse et al. 2004 ). Pathogenic H5N1 virus has a multibasic cleavage site that can be digested by furin and furin-like proteases, which are more ubiquitously present in human tissues than the trypsin-like enzymes that cleave HA of current human influenza viruses.

Immunosenescence during aging leads to impaired immune responses, which increases the susceptibility of the aged to infectious agents. The elderly are affected by primary immunological changes, which are part of the natural aging process, and secondary immunological changes caused by underlying diseases and unhealthy life styles (Malaguarnera et al. 2001) . Primary changes of the immune system in healthy elderly involve mainly T cells, though changes in natural killer (NK) cells and NK T cell function with age have been noted (Ginaldi et al. 1999c; Solana and Mariani 2000) . T cells show clonal senescence, their potential for expansion is decreased, and their ability to produce certain cytokines and to respond to cytokines decreases. The proportion of T cells with a memory cell phenotype increases while numbers of na\u00efve T cells decrease. Stimulation with new antigens appears to result in shortened immunological memory (Ginaldi et al. 1999b ). The T cell repertoire loses diversity (Effros et al. 2003) due to chronic antigenic stimulation, leading to continued clonal expansion of some T cells, which undermines the homeostatic balance of the immune system. Primary B cell responses in the elderly are commonly low and short-lived, resulting in antibodies with low affinity (Ginaldi et al. 1999a ). Formation of germinal centers is decreased, antigen transport is impaired, and follicular dendritic cells show atrophy and their capacity to form antigen depots is reduced (Zheng et al. 1997; Aydar et al. 2004 ). Autoantibodies are more common and the B cell repertoire becomes more restricted. Many of these changes reflect secondary effects due to an age-related decline of helper functions from CD4 + T cells, which show reduced expression of critical costimulatory receptors that are essential for activation of B cells, germinal center formation and rearrangement, and hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes. Underlying chronic diseases dramatically increase the risk of serious complications of an influenza virus infection. Patients with one or two chronic diseases have 40or 150-fold (respectively) greater risk for developing pneumonia upon influenza virus infection (Janssens and Krause 2004; Stott et al. 2001) .

Influenza virus-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T cells are induced upon intranasal application of influenza A virus (Roti et al. 2008; Swain et al. 2004 ). Viral clearance following a primary infection is mediated in part by CD8 + T cells and in part by antibodies, which in turn require the activity of CD4 + T helper cells for their induction. Lack of CD4 + T cells does not affect induction of a primary CD8 + T cell response to influenza A virus (Yap and Ada 1978; Mozdzanowska et al. 2005) , although absence of CD4 + T cells in general reduces the magnitude of the memory CD8 + T cell pool and the CD8 + T cell recall response. Neither IFN-g nor IFN-a/b appear to be essential for viral clearance (Price et al. 2000) , although loss of both IFN pathways has been reported to exacerbate disease.

Protective neutralizing antibody responses induced by infection or vaccination are subtype specific and do not provide protection against heterotypic challenge. Their ability to provide resistance to an antigenic drift subtype depends on the degree of antigenic variation between the viruses (Kaye et al. 1969) . It must pointed out, however, that although the role of neutralizing antibodies in providing resistance to influenza virus is not debated, it remains far from clear-cut. Some mouse studies showed that adaptive transfer of neutralizing secretory IgA protected the animals, while transfer of neutralizing antibodies of the IgG isotype was inefficient (Renegar and Small 1991) . Other mouse studies showed that protection by H5-specific IgG1 monoclonal antibodies can be achieved against H5N1 infections (Hanson et al. 2006 ). Yet others reported protection by IgG antibodies that bound HA but failed to neutralize the virus (McLain and Dimmock 1989). One monoclonal neutralizing antibody was described that cross-reacted between H1 and H2 and consequently protected animals upon passive transfer against infection with either virus (Okuno et al. 1994 ). In other virus infections, such as those with rabies virus, where neutralizing antibodies are known to play a dominant role in protection against infection and disease, protective titers of neutralizing antibodies have been defined. For rabies virus, a titer of or above 0.5 international units protects against challenge; this knowledge has greatly facilitated vaccination efforts. In contrast, it is still not known what titer of influenza A virus-neutralizing antibodies reliably provides protection against disease.

These studies were confirmed by R. Dutton and colleagues, who studied the efficacy of passively transferred, in vitro activated CD8 + T cells isolated from mice transgenic (tg) for a T cell receptor (TcR) to the influenza A virus HA (Cerwenka et al. 1999) . Transfer of na\u00efve TcR-tg CD8 + T cells failed to provide resistance to challenge. Protection against a lethal infection could be provided by the transfer of rested memory-like or effector TcR-tg CD8 + T cells, although the latter effected more rapid viral clearance, which may indicate that the rested CD8 + T cells needed to expand before they assumed effector functions. Protection was only mediated by CD8 + T cells that were able to home to the infected respiratory tissues.

Ideally, the vaccine would be adjuvanted to induce robust, long-lasting immunity not only in healthy adults but also in high-risk populations such as the elderly, infants, or those suffering from chronic diseases. It is hoped such a vaccine would prevent the development of any future influenza virus pandemics (Table 3) . In experimental animals, some vaccines affect protection against heterotypic challenge with influenza virus, such as vaccines based on M2e (Mozdzanowska et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2004; Slepushkin et al. 1995; Fan et al. 2004; Frace et al. 1999; Neirynck et al. 1999; De Filette et al. 2006; EurekAlert 2007) . Protection through M2e-expressing vaccines is mediated by humoral immunity and can be achieved by passive transfer of monoclonal M2e-specific antibodies prior to virus challenge (Mozdzanowska et al. 2003) . One vaccine developed by W. Gerhard and colleagues was based on an M2e peptide linked to universal T helper cell epitopes. Others developed M2e vaccines based on papilloma virus-like particles (Ginaldi et al. 1999a) , or fusion proteins linking M2e to hepatitis B virus core protein (De Filette et al. 2006 ). All of these subunit vaccines elicited antibodies to M2e in animals that protected against subsequent challenge with different types of influenza A virus, and the M2e-hepatitis B virus core fusion protein vaccine has now entered a phase I trial (EurekAlert 2007) . The immunogenicity of an M2e vaccine could be increased by adjuvants such as Toll-like receptor 5 ligands (Huleatt et al. 2008 ). In one study, passively immunized animals were challenged with influenza A viruses that were identical or that differed in their M2e sequence; animals were protected against viruses that expressed the same M2e sequence but not against subtypes with M2e variants, (Fan et al. 2004) . Several M2e sequences corresponding to the H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 influenza subtypes were formulated using a liposome-based vaccine technology and evaluated as potential immunogens for the development of a \"universal\" influenza vaccine. Mice immunized with the polyvalent liposomal M2e survived challenges with different subtypes of influenza virus, and antiserum from immunized mice provided passive protection to na\u00efve mice (Ernst et al. 2006) . One study on a DNA vaccine expressing M2e fused to the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus reported increased mortality in vaccinated pigs, indicating that a poorly immunogenic vaccine (and DNA vaccines are commonly poorly immunogenic, especially in larger species) may exacerbate influenza virus-associated pathology (Heinen et al. 2002) . In most studies, vaccines expressed one sequence of M2e. Notwithstanding, although M2e is far less variable than HA, it is not completely conserved, and mutants such as those present in recent H5N1 variants have been observed, suggesting that a universal M2e-based vaccine for influenza A virus should incorporate several common variants of M2e, including those that are present (Aydar et al. 2004 ). M2e vaccines induce some protective immunity, although this protection wanes against high challenge doses of virulent virus. M2e vaccines thus need to be optimized further, either through the use of novel adjuvants, or by their incorporation into more immunogenic vaccine carriers. Once this is achieved, M2e vaccines may well become part of an ideal universal vaccine for influenza virus, alleviating the need for a pandemic vaccine.
