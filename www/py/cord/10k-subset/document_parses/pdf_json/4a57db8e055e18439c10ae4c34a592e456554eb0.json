Question 1. How can you implement global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs)? Statement 1.1. Recent global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs can support healthcare workers to develop or strengthen infection prevention and control programs, with a focus on surgical safety, as well as AMR action plans. All healthcare workers should adopt these evidence-based recommendations in their clinical practice. Statement 1.2. A safer surgical care requires a range of precautions aimed at reducing the risk of SSIs before, during and after surgery. Statement 1.3 . To support local implementation of guidelines for the prevention of SSIs, 5 steps of a multimodal strategy, including system change, training and education, evaluation and feedback, communications for awareness raising and institutional safety climate and culture are suggested.",

Early identification of CDI allows the establishment of an early treatment and can improve outcomes. Rapid isolation of infected patients is fundamental to limit C. difficile transmission. This is particularly important in reducing environmental contamination as spores can survive for months in the environment, despite regular use of environmental cleaning agents. Patients with CDI should be maintained in contact (enteric) precautions until the resolution of diarrhea (passage of formed stool for at least 48 h). Patients with known or suspected CDI should ideally be placed in a private room with en suite hand washing and toilet facilities. If a private room is not available, as often occurs, known CDI patients may be cohort, nursed in the same area, though the theoretical risk of transfection with different strains exists. Hand hygiene with soap and water and the use of contact precautions along with a good cleaning and disinfection of the environment and patient equipment should be used by all HCWs contacting any patient with known or suspected CDI. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are highly effective against non-spore-forming organisms, but they may not kill C. difficile spores or remove C. difficile from the hands. The most effective way to remove them from the hands is through handwashing with soap and water.",

Hospitalized patients with neutropenia are at higher risk. However, other host risk factors also include immune deficiencies in general, chronic illness, and malnutrition. The diagnosis of CRBSI is often suspected clinically in a patient using a CVC who presents with fever or chills, unexplained hypotension, and no other localizing sign. Diagnosis of CRBSI requires establishing the presence of bloodstream infection and demonstrating that the infection is related to the catheter. However, blood cultures should not be drawn solely from the catheter port as these are frequently colonized with skin contaminants, thereby increasing the likelihood of a false-positive blood culture. Indeed, according to IDSA guidelines [33] , a definitive diagnosis of CRBSI requires a culture of the same organism from both the catheter tip and at least one percutaneous blood culture. Alternatively, the culture of the same organism from at least two blood samples (one from a catheter hub and the other from a peripheral vein or second lumen) meeting criteria for quantitative blood cultures or differential time to positivity. Most laboratories do not perform quantitative blood cultures, but many laboratories are able to determine the differential time to positivity. Quantitative blood cultures demonstrating a colony count from the catheter hub sample \u2265 3-fold higher than the colony count from the peripheral vein sample (or a second lumen) supports a diagnosis of CRBSI. Differential time to positivity refers to growth detected from the catheter hub sample at least 2 h before growth detected from the peripheral vein sample. The CVC and arterial catheter, if present, should be cultured and removed as soon as possible if the patient has unexplained sepsis or erythema overlying the catheter insertion site or purulence at the catheter insertion site in immunocompromised patients.",

The initial choice of antibiotics will depend on the severity of the patient's clinical disease, the risk factors for infection, and the likely pathogens associated with the specific intravascular device. Resistance to antibiotic therapy due to biofilm formation also has an important role in the management of bacteremia. In fact, the nature of the biofilm structure makes microorganisms difficult to eradicate and confer an inherent resistance to antibiotics.",

Different measures have been implemented to reduce the risk for CRBSI, including the use of maximal barrier, precautions during catheter insertion, effective cutaneous anti-sepsis, and preventive strategies based on inhibiting microorganisms originating from the skin or catheter hub from adhering to the catheter [34] . The simultaneous application of multiple recommended best practices to manage CVCs has been associated with significant declines in the rates of CRBSI. Bundles can be defined as the systematic implementation of a set of evidence-based practices, usually three to five, that when performed properly and collectively can improve patient outcomes. Research on CRBSI prevention demonstrated the effectiveness of bundles, which reduce the incidence of CRBSI by up to 80% [35] [36] [37] , reaching a rate of 0 in some cases [38] . Education and training of healthcare workers and adherence to standardized protocols for insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters significantly reduced the incidence of catheter-related infections and represent the most important preventive measures.",

Thus, laboratories have been forced to optimize their workflow to raise their productivity: this improvement must be accompanied by at least a maintained analytical quality, but possibly by an improved clinical value of the generated data. Automation was introduced many years ago in several diagnostic disciplines such as chemistry, clinical pathology, and hematology to increase laboratory productivity and quality. The automation process was by far more complicated in molecular biology and bacteriology settings: this was due to several reasons, including the complexity and variability of sample types, the many different analytical processes, and the insufficient volume of samples. However, the introduction of automation was considered to be also applicable in microbiology in more recent years thanks to the technological improvements currently available. Recently, these new technologies have triggered the development of automated solutions specifically designed for microbiology. In particular, the automation process has been applied to all the pre-analytical steps and to the evaluation of the results by using sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms. The complete clinical laboratory automation is currently the main organizational challenge for microbiologists [50] .",

The microbiota of the skin, respiratory epithelium, and the gastrointestinal tract are altered within a few days in the hospital. Patients' flora can be deranged by antibiotics, chemotherapy, or acquisition of nosocomial organisms. Patients who are colonized with resistant bacteria serve inadvertently as potential reservoirs for transmission. Colonization pressure, or the proportion of patients in a given unit who are colonized with resistant bacteria, is an independent risk factor for transmission. Surveillance cultures for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been advocated in a number of reports and recommendations as part of an overall strategy to combat it. Active screening for CRE using rectal surveillance cultures has been shown to be highly effective, when part of a comprehensive infection control program, in halting the spread of CRE in healthcare facilities [53] .",

They should focus on collaboration between all healthcare professionals to shared knowledge and widespread diffusion of practice. The involvement of HCWs may raise their awareness of AMR [44] . It is essential for any team to have at least one member who is an infectious disease specialist. Pharmacists with advanced training or long-standing clinical experience in infectious diseases are also key actors for the design and implementation of the stewardship program interventions monitoring consumption data of antibiotics. In any healthcare setting, a significant amount of energy should be spent on IPC. Infection control specialists and hospital epidemiologists should be always included in these programs to coordinate efforts on monitoring and preventing HAIs. Microbiologists should actively guide the proper use of tests and the flow of laboratory results. Being involved in providing surveillance data on AMR, they should provide periodic reports on AMR data allowing the multidisciplinary team to determine the ongoing burden of AMR in the hospital. Moreover, timely and accurate reporting of microbiology susceptibility test results allows the selection of more appropriate targeted therapy and may help reduce broad-spectrum antimicrobial use. Surgeons with adequate knowledge in surgical infections and surgical anatomy when involved may audit both antibiotic prescriptions and prevention practices, provide feedback to the prescribers and integrate best practices of antimicrobial use among surgeons, and act as champions among colleagues implementing change within their own sphere of influence. Infections are the main factors contributing to mortality in ICUs. Intensivists have a critical role in treating multidrug-resistant organisms in ICUs in critically ill patients. They have a crucial role in prescribing antimicrobial agents for the most challenging patients and are at the forefront of successful antibiotic prescribing policies. Emergency departments (EDs) represent a particularly important setting for addressing inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing practices, given the frequent use of antibiotics in this setting that sits at the interface of the community and the hospital. Therefore, also ED practitioners should be involved. Without adequate support from hospital management, these programs will be inadequate or inconsistent since the programs do not generate revenue. Engagement of hospital management has been confirmed as a key factor for both developing and sustaining. Finally, an essential participant who has been often unrecognized and underutilized is the \"staff nurse\" as nurses perform numerous functions that are integral to success.",

In simple terms, a DDD is the amount of drug that a typical patient might receive on any day for therapeutic purposes. An important advantage of using DDDs is the relative ease of hospital systems to report consumption using DDDs: most pharmacy departments have a mechanism to calculate overall prescription, dispensing, or consumption of a quantity of antimicrobials, allowing DDDs/1000 patient-days to be relatively easy to calculate if bed utilization is also available. Additionally, institution-wide consumption can be benchmarked against similar institutions.

One of the most important roles nurses have today is patient education. This was once reserved for the physician, but no longer. Today nurses assume more and more responsibility for educating patients and helping them to become responsible for their own health status. Patients need to take a proactive role in their own healthcare. This means they need to comprehend their health status and work to stabilize and prevent or minimize complications such as HAIs. Demographic variables, such as formal education level, reading ability, and barriers to participation in education, must be considered to maximize the effectiveness of self-management education outcomes.

Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative SSI, or when foreign materials are implanted. 3. Antibiotics given as prophylaxis should be effective against the aerobic and anaerobic pathogens most likely to contaminate the surgical site, i.e., Grampositive skin commensals or normal flora colonizing the incised mucosae. 4. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics beginning within 30-60 min before the surgical incision is recommended for most antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin), to ensure adequate serum and tissue concentrations during the period of potential contamination. Obese patients \u2265 120 kg require higher doses of antibiotics. 5. A single dose is generally sufficient. Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2-4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic) or with associated significant blood loss (> 1.5 L). 6.

Although that study was disappointing as far as showing improved behaviors, others have shown that ASPs may have a significant impact on optimizing antibiotic use in surgical prophylaxis practices [72, 73] . Van Kasteren et al. [73] in a prospective multisite study of elective procedures in 13 Dutch hospitals evaluated the quality of prophylaxis auditing before and after an intervention consisting of performance feedback and implementation of national clinical practice guidelines. Antimicrobial use decreased from 121 to 79 DDD/100 procedures, and costs reduced by 25% per procedure. After the intervention, antibiotic choice was inappropriate in only 37.5% of the cases instead of 93.5% expected cases in the absence of any intervention. Prolonged prophylaxis was observed in 31.4% instead of 46.8% expected cases and inappropriate timing in 39.4% instead of the expected 51.8%. Time series analysis showed that all improvements were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The overall SSI rates before and after the intervention were 5.4% (95% CI 4.3-6.5) and 4.6% (95% CI 3.6-5.4), respectively [73] . Huh et al. [72] performed an interrupted time-series study of an ASP relating to surgical prophylaxis in a tertiary care hospital. The ASP consisted of monitoring of performance indicators and implementation of a computerized decision support system. The program was effective in improving multiple measures including the total use of antibiotics, the use of third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, trends in proportions of resistant bacterial strains such as meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and length of stay. Saied et al. [12] implemented ASPs in 5 tertiary, acute-care surgical hospitals. The ASPs consisted of education aimed at surgeons and anesthesiologists, audit and feedback, and selection of surgeon champions. The efficacy of the intervention on timing and duration of antibiotic prophylaxis varied across hospitals when measured preand post-ASP implementation. Local factors such as available resources and stakeholder engagement likely play a role in the conflicting results of ASPs addressing surgical prophylaxis across different settings, as seen in these studies.",

But, the use of excessive antifungal agents would be associated with substantially increased overall healthcare costs and might lead to the emergence of resistance. Unfortunately, early diagnosis of IC remains a challenge, and criteria for starting empirical antifungal therapy in ICU patients are poorly defined. To both ensure appropriate and timely antifungal therapy and to avoid unnecessary use of antifungal agents, some authors have developed clinical prediction rules to identify patients at high risk of candidiasis and for whom initiation of empirical antifungal therapy could be justified. However, there are many concerns about these rules: high specificity but low sensitivity. In 2006, a Spanish group, using the database of the Estudio de Prevalencia de CANdidiasis project, identified four predictors of proven invasive Candida infection. Based on these predictors, a score named \"Candida score\" (CS) was built. In 2009, the same group demonstrated a significant linear association between increasing values of the CS and the rate of invasive Candida infections [93] . The factors to predict IC were surgery, multifocal colonization, total parenteral nutrition, and severe sepsis. To each risk factor, 1 point was given, and for clinical sepsis, a score of 2 was given. The cutoff value of 2.5 had sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 74% [93] . Although blood cultures are still considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it has been shown that they are negative in up to 50% of cases [94] . Thus, non-culture diagnostic techniques based on serological biomarkers detecting fungal cell components and/or antibodies directed against these components have been investigated. All these diagnostic tests may diagnose IC earlier than clinical or culture-based measures.",

There is compelling evidence that CVC removal is associated with higher rates of treatment success and lower mortality rates as compared with CVC retention [98] .

In 2015, \u00c7akmak\u00e7i [108] suggested that the engagement of surgeons in ASPs might be crucial to their success. However, in 2013, Duane et al. [109] showed poor compliance with surgical services with ASP recommendations. A retrospective study by Sartelli et al. [110] showed that implementation of an education-based ASP achieved a significant improvement in all antimicrobial agent prescriptions and a reduction in antimicrobial drug consumption. In a surgical unit performing mainly elective major abdominal surgery and emergency surgery, both a local protocol of surgical prophylaxis and a set of guidelines for the management of intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) and control of antimicrobial agent use were introduced. Comparing the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods, the mean total monthly antimicrobial use decreased by 18.8%, from 1074.9 defined DDDs per 1000 patient-days to 873.0 DDDs per 1000 patient-days after the intervention. The model was based on the concept of the \"surgeon champion.\" The \"champion\" was a surgeon who on a day-to-day basis worked within the surgical unit, promoting and maintaining a culture in which IPC appropriate use of antibiotics was of high importance. Identifying a local opinion leader to serve as a champion may be important because the \"surgeon champion\" may integrate the best clinical practices and drive the colleagues in changing behaviors. We believe that the concept of the \"surgeon champion\" can be a crucial way to improve IPC across the surgical pathway.",

The concept of a planned re-laparotomy for severe peritonitis has been debated for over 30 years. Re-operations are performed every 48 h for reassessing the peritoneal inflammatory process until the abdomen is free of ongoing peritonitis; then the abdomen is closed. The advantages of the planned re-laparotomy approach are optimization of resource utilization and reduction of the potential risk for gastrointestinal fistulas and delayed hernias. The results of a clinical trial published in 2007 by Van Ruler et al. [115] investigating the differences between ondemand and planned re-laparotomy strategies in patients with severe peritonitis found few advantages for the planned re-laparotomy strategy; however, the study mentioned that this latter group exhibited a reduced need for additional re-laparotomies, decreased patient dependency on subsequent healthcare services, and decreased overall medical costs.",

Its secretion is initiated 4 to 6 h after an inflammatory insult (effect mediated by cytokines namely interleukin-6), and its concentration doubles every 8 h with a peak at 36-50 h [117] . The sole determinant of CRP plasmatic levels is its synthesis rate, which is proportional to the intensity of the inflammatory insult. Its production and elimination are not influenced by renal replacement therapy or immunosuppression (both systemic steroids and neutropenia). It has a sensitivity of 68-92% and a specificity of 40-67% as a marker of bacterial infection. Its low specificity and inability to differentiate bacterial infections from non-infectious causes of inflammation make CRP of limited diagnostic value [118] . The available assays for CRP measurement are reliable, stable, reproducible, rapid, inexpensive, and present an acceptable limit of detection (0.3-5 mg/L). CRP has been analyzed in multiple clinical contexts, but only a small number of studies have focused on its use for optimizing antibiotic therapy [119] . In primary care, CRP improves the assessment of the severity of infection and extent of inflammation [120] and performs better in predicting the diagnosis of pneumonia than any individual or combination of clinical signs and symptoms. A Cochrane review [121] demonstrated reduced antibiotic prescription with CRP testing, which led to its incorporation in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the diagnosis of pneumonia. CRP has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis; however, it lacks specificity. Multiple studies have examined the sensitivity of CRP level alone for the diagnosis of appendicitis in patients selected to undergo appendectomy. Gurleyik et al. noted a CRP sensitivity of 96.6% in 87 of 90 patients with a histologically proven disease [122] . Similarly, Shakhatreh found a CRP sensitivity of 95.5% in 85 of 89 patients with histologically proven appendicitis [123] . Asfar et al. reported a CRP sensitivity of 93.6% in 78 patients undergoing appendectomy [124] .",
