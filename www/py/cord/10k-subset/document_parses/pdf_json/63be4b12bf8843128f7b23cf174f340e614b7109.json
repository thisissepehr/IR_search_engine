The equation is determined by a matrix with the same spectrum as the next generation matrix and it exhibits a threshold controlled by the common dominant eigenvalue, the basic reproduction number R 0 : There is a unique positive solution giving the size of the epidemic if and only if R 0 exceeds unity. When mixing heterogeneities arise only from variation in contact rates and proportionate mixing, the final size of the epidemic in a heterogeneously mixing population is always smaller than that in a homogeneously mixing population with the same basic reproduction number R 0 . For other mixing patterns, the relation may be reversed.",

For epidemics on networks, the size of the giant cluster corresponds to the final size and behavioral heterogeneities, reflected in the degree-distribution, are in fact the core of many network studies (Keeling 1999; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani 2001; Eames and Keeling 2002; Newman 2002) . The final size problem is also pivotal in the \"burn-out approximation\" that separates the fast (epidemic) time scale from slower processes such as host genetics (Gillespie 1975) , host demography (May 1985; Andreasen and Frommelt 2005) , or influenza-drift (Andreasen 2003; Boni et al. 2004; Andreasen and Sasaki 2006) .",

            "text": "For a deterministic epidemic in a closed, homogeneous population, the final size equation gives the number (or frequency) of susceptible hosts at the end of the epidemic and involves only a single parameter, the basic reproduction number R 0 . The equation may be derived by studying how the size of the infectious class varies with the size of the susceptible class through the epidemic-an approach that dates back to Kermack and McKendrick (1927) . The original Kermack-McKendrik-equation, and hence the final epidemic size is not affected by heterogeneities in the temporal or host-specific intensity of infectivity, in the sense that these quantities only change the equation through their effect on R 0 (Ma and Earn 2006) . Heterogeneity in susceptibility, however, introduces nonlinearities that qualitatively change the structure of the equation and epidemic size. A generalization of the final size relation to heterogeneous susceptibility was first obtained by Gart (1968) for the case where only susceptibility varies. Ball (1985) generalized Gart's result to stochastic epidemics and proved that for fixed R 0 the final size of a Gart epidemic is always smaller than the epidemic in a homogeneous population. Modern reformulations of Gart's results extending them to proportionate mixing may be found in Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) , Sect. 6.4 and in Dwyer et al. (2000) , Andreasen (2003) , Arino et al. (2007) , Brauer (2008) , Volz (2008a Volz ( , 2008b . Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) , Sect. 6.3 derive the final size relation for general mixing patterns but do not analyze its structure in detail. Corless et al. (1996) relate the final size equation to the Lambert W-function.",

However, the proofs allow us to discuss different aspects of the final size relation.

In particular, we show that Ball's result holds for a wider class of proportionate mixing patterns including situations where variation in susceptibility and infectivity is due only to heterogeneity in contact rates.

The linear part is similar to the next generation matrix describing the conditions at the onset of the epidemic, but while the rows of the next generation matrix scale with the sizes of the subpopulations, for the final size matrix it is the columns that scale. Since the final size matrix can be obtained from the next generation matrix by a coordinate transformation, the two matrices have the same spectrum. In particular, the common dominant eigenvalue R 0 controls the epidemic threshold for the onset of the epidemic as well as the number of roots of the final size equation. This generalizes the dual role played by R 0 in the classical homogeneous epidemic model.",

This case includes heterogeneity that is solely due to variation in contact rates combined with proportionate mixing, thus it includes most models of venereal diseases and many models of air-borne infections. We show that for this case the final size in the heterogeneously mixing population is always smaller than what it would have been in a homogeneously mixing population with the same basic reproduction number in analogy with the results for endemic diseases in heterogeneously mixing populations (Hethcote and Yorke 1984) . However, if the ordering of susceptibilities is the reverse of the ordering of infectivities, heterogeneity may lead to an increase in epidemic size. Mathematically mixing patterns with such negative correlation between susceptibility and infectivity are known to cause unusual results. They can, for example, give rise to sustained oscillations in an age-structured SIR-model (Andreasen 1995) , but their biological importance remains to be seen.",

While the final size equation generalizes naturally, there is no obvious generalization of the condition that the magnitude of susceptibility and infectivity are ordered in the same sequence.
