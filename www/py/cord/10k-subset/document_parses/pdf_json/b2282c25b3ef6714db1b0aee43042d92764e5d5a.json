A third day highlighted the basics of Disaster Site Safety including: blood borne pathogens, personal protective equipment, respiratory protection, radiation basics, and fatigue mitigation. The WWO excerpted relevant safety information from a well-established Disaster Site Safety course and a Collateral Duty course. The focus was on the kinds of safety risks that were likely to be encountered in the field during a deployment. Five experienced trainers also shared relevant insights about public health deployments they had gained during prior emergency responses. This innovative, highly-interactive, educational approach also incorporated small group analysis of three realistic, deploymentbased scenarios. The culmination of class included immersion in one, 50-minute Virtual Reality Environment (VRE). The VRE options included a simulated deployment to: a rural African village, a city devastated by a hurricane, a town rocked by an earthquake, a community hit by a radiological dispersal device, a location dealing with a pandemic, a deliberate release of a toxic substance, or a food-borne infectious disease outbreak.",

The assessment scores of approximately 200 different deployers were outside the norms for the externally validated assessments that were used.

Or if a person had just lost their father, it might not be advantageous to the CDC or in the individual's best interests to deploy right away. There were a few occasions when it was advisable for a RAMP mental health professional to consult with a CDC OHC medical professional who had completed a physical assessment of the potential deployer. During those consultations, the mental health and medical professionals determined deployment eligibility jointly. The RAMP clinicians ensured that all information related to assessments, concerns, and conversations remained secure and confidential in the OHC's electronic medical record system.

For several years, EOC leadership requested that the resilience team provide an overview of basic resilience-related principles in those briefings. The resilience briefer highlighted physiological, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms of stress and emphasized the importance of self-care and social support. In virtually every briefing, the resilience briefer made this norm-setting statement: \"Emergency response is much more like a marathon than a sprint, so it's important to pace yourself while you're deployed.\" The briefing coordinator shared with briefing participants additional written material and references to supplemental resources, including contact information for EAP professionals.",

Responders also received access to relevant information and, if desired, additional support after an especially challenging deployment. Also, RAMP developed a plan and implemented a process for team members to send personalized emails to returned Ebola responders. The RAMP team member conducting the outreach obtained from the CDC's EOC a list of staff getting ready to return from the field. They sent those individuals a standardized email inviting them by name to participate in a voluntary, confidential, non-clinical conversation about what they experienced in the field. Between September 24, 2014 and June 8, 2016, RAMP team members emailed invitations to 2,928 different individuals who had deployed as part of the CDC's Ebola response.
