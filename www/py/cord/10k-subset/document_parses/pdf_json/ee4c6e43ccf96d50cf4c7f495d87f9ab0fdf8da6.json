Alternatively, they may aid people in overcoming cognitive and affective limitations that prevent them from appreciating a situation's moral dimensions. Or they may simply make it easier for them to make the morally right choice by helping them to overcome sources of weakness of will. This paper makes two assumptions. First, technologies to improve people's moral capacities are realizable. Second, such technologies will actually help people get morality right and behave more consistently with whatever the 'real' right thing to do turns out to be. The paper then considers whether or not humanity loses anything valuable, particularly opportunities for moral progress, when being moral is made much easier by eliminating difficult moral deliberation and internal moral struggle. Ultimately, the worry that moral struggle has value as a catalyst for moral progress is rejected. Moral progress is understood here as the discovery and application of new values or sensitization to new sources of harm.",

After undergoing a series of treatments, you have lost your taste for animal products and other foods that have a high carbon footprint. In addition, although foods with a greater environmental impact are available, they are placed on the lowest shelves in the grocery store and the sustainable ones are at eye-level, where you always end up grabbing them.

It is essential to combat the insensitivity, or \"psychic numbing,\" felt towards large numbers of victims, and the preference people have for single, identifiable ones (Slovic 2010) . Therefore, you take your daily dose of Empathico. Empathico is a personalized drug, which improves one's ability to overcome insensitivity to large numbers of victims and feelings of \"compassion fatigue\" by allowing you to vividly imagine each of them as individuals (Vastfjall et al. 2014) .",

The ethical issues they raise are distinct from those posed by less invasive and risky technological interventions, like a wearable fitness tracker that also automatically reminds one to perform a daily act of kindness. However, they are grouped together here because of their shared purpose, moral improvement, and for the reason that a worry about their interference in moral progress can apply to them all.",

There is some evidence, for example, that a feeling of disgust induced by morally irrelevant environmental factors plays a role in the strength of people's moral judgments . Moral technology may serve to dampen or even eliminate this kind of \"performance error\" (Ibid). Third, they may simply make it easier for people to make the morally right choice, helping them to overcome ego depletion, for example. Ego depletion is the phenomenon that self-control is a finite resource that can be depleted and then requires time to be restored (Baumeister et al. 1998 ). 2 Beyond this specific phenomenon, moral technologies may help us overcome the deleterious effects of stress, fatigue, hunger, and other sources of weakness of will.",

Just as people can offload certain cognitive tasks, such as keeping track of appointments on the calendar application on their smart phones, the phenomenon of moral offloading is getting machines to do moral work for people in a variety of ways, be it care work, tactful communication, or automatically sending birthday cards (for an example of this phenomenon, see Lee et al. 2017) ; these technologies will allow them to delegate certain internal moral processes to the environment, a technology, or other kind of intervention.

This is because moral struggle is generally accepted as part of what it is that any metaethical or moral psychological theory needs to explain. It is especially important that these theories account for the fact that individuals sometimes, perhaps even often, fail to act in accordance with what they think is the best way to act from a moral perspective.

Moral overload arises in situations in which one's moral obligations outstrip one's material resources, either physical or financial (Kuran 1999, p. 233) . Because one cannot execute what one takes to be one's obligations or duties, one is left with a feeling of \"moral dissonance, psychological discomfort\" (Ibid).

Thus, experiencing moral struggle may be a catalyst for new and radical moral innovations; for example, strategies of nonviolent resistance to authoritarian political regimes that have emerged from movements and leaders of movements during times of great inner moral conflict.

It makes the implausible claim that with the help of moral technologies of various sorts, people will be able to reach a state of moral perfection, which seems overly optimistic. One reason to be pessimistic about this is that what constitutes moral perfection is only available from the perspective of a particular moral theory. On a hedonistic utilitarian account, for example, a world in which no further moral progress is possible might require that the suffering of all sentient beings is at the lowest possible attainable level and their pleasure is maximized. Therefore, while it is a problematic assumption that a moral Shangri-La needs moral progress, it can be overcome.",

This can reduce an individual's overall mental burden, thus contributing to making better decisions when they are not automated. This could be especially important for people whose decisions can have serious impacts on the well-being of others: physicians and nurses, soldiers, police, lawmakers, and so on. In medicine, for example, many decisions and behaviors of ethical import are made on a daily basis, requiring varying degrees of attention, concentration, and effort. In a moral Shangri-La, routine matters of ethical significance are made easier through technology, say, an electronic \"nudge\" that reminds the physician to warmly greet her patient with a handshake when they meet. This may free the physician to dedicate more of their time and energy to assessing the decision-making capacity of a mildly demented patient to refuse life-saving medical care, a decision with arguably greater moral significance.",

Before such an argument can be made, however, some suggestive evidence is offered that moral technologies and the reduction of moral struggle could indeed have these kinds of effects on well-being and stress. Wilhelm Hoffmann and colleagues have demonstrated that individuals with higher levels of self-control experience higher degrees of momentary positive affect as well as higher overall reported life satisfaction (Hofmann et al. 2014) . The fact that both of these measures of well-being are positively correlated to self-control is telling; it weighs against the picture of the highly selfcontrolled person as one who forgoes momentary pleasures and thus experiences a reduction in positive affect, and instead achieves long-term goals.",

The technologies may function as a kind of training aid, helping people acquire virtues through habituation. 5 In that case they support the development of true virtue.",

Non-technical education can also play a role in making sure that users understand the underlying reasons for the interventions they are subject to or with which they are engaging. This objection can also be defused from a more theoretical perspective. One does not need to be concurrently aware that one's action is virtuous; instead, one can hold the belief that actions that conform to certain kinds of standards (or whatever the criteria might be) are virtuous, and be aware that one consensually modifies one's environment to make these actions likely.

Basic Kantian ethics states that morality must, therefore, be founded on the exercise of specific human capacities that individuals are responsible for and of which they are in control. If what matters morally is simply having the right kind of disposition-kindly or sympathetic-being moral would be out of some people's reach because their emotional dispositions are largely out of their control.

Moral technologies may contribute to the affective or desire-like component of motivation without undermining an individual's attitude of respect for the moral law or duty. Another possibility is that moral technologies serve, in some cases, to remind one of one's duties in particular instances or prompt one to act on them. This possibility would also not undermine the moral value of the act on Kantian standards as long as one holds a standing commitment to respect for the moral law and duty. Living with the help of moral technologies can be done out of respect for the moral law itself.",

Whether or not moral struggle has independent value remains an unanswered question. It is a question that demands to be explored in future work on moral technologies, as does, specifically, the phenomenon of moral offloading. This paper, however, considered whether moral struggle is necessary for moral progress and concluded that it is not. There is also exciting work to be done on expanding on the notions of moral residue and overload, especially with respect to the role of technology. Joroen Van den Hoven, Gert-Jan Lokhorst, and Ibo Van de Poel see the potential for technological progress and moral progress to be mutually reinforcing processes.",
