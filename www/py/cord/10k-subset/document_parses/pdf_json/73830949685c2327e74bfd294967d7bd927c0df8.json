However, when oncohematological patients were excluded from the analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of the test dropped to 22% and 84%, respectively [21] .",

In addition, when combined with other fungal biomarkers in serum (either GM or BDG) or in BAL (GM), Aspergillus PCR has shown to increase the diagnostic sensitivity up to 100%, further supporting the implementation of this technique in the revised definition of invasive fungal infection by the EORTC/MSG. Experience with non-neutropenic patients is scarce, but the efficacy of molecular techniques seems to be similar to that for the population with hematological malignancies [43] . Another application of molecular biology techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis is the ability to detect azole-resistant strains earlier than do conventional methods [44] .

In addition, the intravenous formulation does not include cyclodextrin, a nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic compound, which is included in the intravenous formulations of the other triazoles in order to increase solubility. Compared to voriconazole, isavuconazole also has the advantages of linear and predictable pharmacokinetics which is likely to obviate the need for therapeutic drug monitoring and fewer CYP enzyme-mediated drug interactions [66] . A large randomized, doubleblind trial has demonstrated non-inferiority or isavuconazole versus voriconazole in terms of all-cause mortality when used as primary treatment for invasive fungal disease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi, with a superior safety profile [16] .",
