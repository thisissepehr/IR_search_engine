Exploring the particular challenges facing these communities is essential to improving public health planning. In alignment with the objectives of the Pandemic Influenza Outbreak Research Modelling (Pan-InfORM) team, a Canadian public health workshop was held at the Centre for Disease Modelling (CDM) to: (i) evaluate post-pandemic research findings; (ii) identify existing gaps in knowledge that have yet to be addressed through ongoing research and collaborative activities; and (iii) build upon existing partnerships within the research community to forge new collaborative links with Aboriginal health organizations. The workshop achieved its objectives in identifying main research findings and emerging information post pandemic, and highlighting key challenges that pose significant impediments to the health protection and promotion of Canadian Aboriginal populations. The health challenges faced by Canadian indigenous populations are unique and complex, and can only be addressed through active engagement with affected communities. The academic research community will need to develop a new interdisciplinary framework, building upon concepts from 'Communities of Practice', to ensure that the research priorities are identified and targeted, and the outcomes are translated into the context of community health to improve policy and practice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The mandate of Pan-InfORM is to develop knowledge translation methodologies with the aim of bridging the gaps between theory, policy, and practice [1] .

Geographic isolation complicates policy decisions, as the availability and lifespan of medicines need to be continually assessed to make accurate decisions about the shipment of medical supplies to remote communities. This was marked as one of the greatest challenges in serving these communities during the H1N1 pandemic outbreaks.

Overlapping jurisdictions create conflicts in terms of identifying correct procedures to follow and assigning the responsibility for provision of care. Currently, the provincial and federal governments share these responsibilities and there is little consistency in the modes for public health delivery between regions, especially between on-reserve and off-reserve indigenous populations.

The rapid containment of SARS as the first major infectious disease threat of the 21 st century was a public health success in the modern era [31] , but also a warning that the global containment of emerging diseases may be much more difficult in this highly connected world, if not impossible. The 2009 influenza pandemic demonstrated this difficulty and incurred disproportionately large economic and political impacts, in addition to differential effects on many subpopulations including Aboriginal peoples and underserved communities [3] . While the focus here has been on First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people in Canada, these experiences were similar to what happened for Indigenous people living in the United States, Australia and New Zealand [32] [33] [34] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 631, "end": 635, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1030, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1244, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1249, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1254, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The objectives of this networking event, and the spectrum of participants, attested to the fact that in the relatively short period of time since the inception of Pan-Inform, significant progress has been achieved through the hosting of bi-annual workshops of this scale. These networking activities have encouraged more intricate disciplinary dialogues, which challenge participants to re-evaluate their assumptions so that they are eventually resolved or dissolved. As a result of such interdisciplinary approaches, new and stronger links between theory, policy and practice have been forged. A strength of the workshop was the presentation of how appropriate use of data can lead to novel scientific findings that influence policy and practice. This is realized by involving the research community, affected populations, and policy makers in the interpretation and contextual use of data, which is becoming increasingly important as modellers aim to introduce ever more complex structures into the models such as social network patterns.
