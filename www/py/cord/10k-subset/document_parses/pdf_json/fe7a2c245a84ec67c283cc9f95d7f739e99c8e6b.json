            "text": "A new computational methodology for the accurate numerical calculation of the Cauchy stress tensor, stress invariants, principal stress components, von Mises and Tresca tensors is developed. The methodology is based on the atomic stress approach which permits the calculation of stress tensors, widely used in continuum mechanics modeling of materials properties, using the output from the MD simulations of discrete atomic and C \u03b1 -based coarsegrained structural models of biological particles. The methodology mapped into the software package TensorCalculator was successfully applied to the empty cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) shell to explore the evolution of mechanical stress in this mechanicallytested specific example of a soft virus capsid. We found an inhomogeneous stress distribution in various portions of the CCMV structure and stress transfer from one portion of the virus structure to another, which also points to the importance of entropic effects, often ignored in finite element analysis and elastic network modeling. We formulate a criterion for elastic deformation using the first principal stress components. Furthermore, we show that von Mises and Tresca stress tensors can be used to predict the onset of a viral capsid's mechanical failure, which leads to total structural collapse. TensorCalculator can be used to study stress evolution and dynamics of defects in viral capsids and other large-size protein assemblies.",

Applied to large biological supramolecular complexes, such as viruses, microtubules, micro-and nanocompartments, and small cellular organelles [4] [5] [6] [7] , dynamic force spectroscopy has enabled researchers to interrogate these large-size biological protein assemblies mechanically, to probe the limits of their mechanical strength, and to gather valuable information about their nanomechanical characteristics, including the critical deformation, Youngs modulus, shear modulus, flexural rigidity, etc [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Although a considerable amount of experimental effort has been expended to understand how the mechanical response of biological particles depends on their compressive-force induced deformation, many difficulties remain, e.g. regarding the interpretation of force-deformation spectra [18] . Experimental resolution in the state-of-the-art singlemolecule forced-deformation assays do not allow researchers to extract the molecular level structural details underlying dynamic transitions in biological particles, such as buckling and structural collapse.",

            "text": "The past decade has witnessed rapid progress in the development of computational methods for modeling large biological assemblies to understand their unique physico-chemical properties (e.g. stiffening, softening, buckling, etc). Among these are: finite element analysis (FEA) [14, [19] [20] [21] , explicit and implicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [22] [23] [24] , elastic network modeling (ENM) [25] [26] [27] , and various coarse-graining (CG) techniques [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . However, these approaches have exhibited a number of drawbacks. For example, FEA and ENM approaches do not take into account the discrete nature of biological particles' structures, such as a virion (formed by self-assembly of capsid proteins) or a microtubule (built by laterally and longitudinally assembled head-to-tail linked \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers). Because these approaches do not have a thermostat, they cannot capture the stochastic nature of biological particles' mechanical deformation and collapse. The all-atom MD simulations account for the discreteness and stochastic variation of the particles' structures, but owing to their immense system size the all-atom MD schemes do not allow researchers to follow the dynamics of particles in the biologically relevant timescale. Langevin simulations of particles' nanoindentation, in conjunction with some of the coarse-grained models, employ force-loading rates three orders of magnitude faster than their experimental counterparts [28, 31] , and so the results of experiments in vitro and in silico cannot be compared.",

This approach utilized the simple, yet accurate C \u03b1 -based coarse-grained self-organized polymer (SOP) model [37, 38] and Langevin dynamics to simulate the force loading experiments on a computer, obtaining a high-resolution detailed molecular picture of the entire indentation process, while also allowing extraction of important mechanical and thermodynamic characteristics of the system, not accessible from experiment [6, 24, 36, 39] . The SOP model is a simplified native-topology based model of biomolecules which has been used to explore the mechanical properties of protein assemblies [24, 36, 39] . The \u223c10-100 fold computational acceleration attainable on graphics processing units (GPUs) with SOP-GPU software allows for using the experimental force protocol and reaching biologically relevant timescales up to hundreds of milliseconds [34, 40, 41] , which makes the results comparable with the experimental data. This approach to forced indentation in silico has been successfully applied to study the biomechanics of a range of biological particles, including CCMV virus capsids [36] , microtubules [24] and nanocompartment encapsulin [6] .",

This software enables researchers to compute the stress distribution in biological matter using the results of MD simulations. The approach utilizes an idea of 'local atomic stress', i.e. when the stress is represented by the derivative of the total atomic forces acting on a particular atom along different directions. Taking the average over all the interactions involving this atom mimics the integration over all the forces acting on an arbitrary volume element [42] . This approach was first introduced by Basinski [43] for the calculation of shear stress in a simple body-centered cubic lattice. Shortly thereafter, Hardy derived this stress measure in a more general form [44] , which later was adapted by researches in their studies of material properties of crystalline substances [45] [46] [47] and amorphous structures [48] . Ishikura et al used this concept in conjunction with the MD simulations and allatom force field to calculate the atomic forces and local atomic stresses in short polypeptide chains [49] . To our knowledge, there has been only a single study [50] , in which this approach was used to compute the stress distribution in viral shells.",

In AFM-based single-particle compressive-force experiments, the particle's dynamics is projected along the direction of particle deformation ('reaction coordinate'), which limits the information obtainable. The force-deformation spectra reveal the critical forces and critical deformations for the collapse transition, but offer little insight as to what caused the transition and do not provide structural details. Here, we show that dynamic evo lution of biological particles can be illuminated by considering the propagation and distribution of mechanical stress in the particle's structure. We use cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) as a suitable model system since it was extensively studied previously by us [36, 51] and other research groups [20, 27, 31, 52] . We explore the rich dynamics of stress distribution in the CCMV shell tested mechanically by considering the most common stress measures used to describe properties of materials, including the first principal stress, von Mises shear stress, and Tresca shear stress [53, 54] . Our results raise questions regarding some of the theoretical approaches used to model the dynamics of biological particles, including finite element analysis and elastic network models, in which stochastic fluctuations and entropic effects are ignored. We also formulate for soft biological particles like CCMV the yield condition in terms of the first principal stress comp onents, and the failure criterion in terms of von Mises stress or Tresca stress.",

TensorCalculator works in conjunction with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) package [65] and our own lab-written scripts (available in TensorCalculator repository). Calculation of the scalar stress quantities for visualization and graphics can be done independently from stress tensors' calculations, as long as the input TNSR file is provided. Therefore, TensorCalculator allows for a quick recalculation as many times as necessary, e.g. for different averaging options (cut-offs). Since the values of stress tensors per C \u03b1 -atom can fluctuate significantly both in space and time, different types of averaging can be tried in order to make visualization and graphical representation smooth and continuous. The running average can be chosen in order to smooth out the stress fluctuations along the trajectory. In addition, different types of averaging over the particles can be specified, e.g. averaging over the structure segments or within a cut-off radius, in order to obtain a smooth and continuous stress gradient. Examples of configuration files for running the TensorCalculator software package for several model systems are provided in the code repository (https:// github.com/BarsegovGroup/TensorCalculator.git).",

The normal stress (\u03c3 N ) was obtained by projecting the tensor component along the direction of pulling (x-axis) roughly equal to a vector connecting the C-and N-termini (end-to-end vector). In figure 1 (a), we display the time-dependent profiles of the stress characteristics averaged over the chain (total of 34 beads). To directly compare the stress in a molecular chain due to applied pulling force, we converted the stress quantity (given in units of Pa) into the molecular force or tension (in units of pico-Newtons) using the formula: F = (4/3)\u03c0a 2 eff \u03c3 N , where \u03c3 N is the average normal molecular stress and a eff = 1/N a i is the average radius of cross-sectional area of the chain (see equation (11)). Because the chain is formed by the beads of radius 3.4 \u00c5 , a eff \u2248 3.4 \u00c5.

We see that the agreement between the molecular tension F computed with TensorCalculator and the applied pulling force f (t) is excellent. Both force-time curves show force peaks, which mark the unfolding transition in the WW-domain. Small differences are due to the non-zero shear component of the stress, which is not analyzed in the context of protein forced unfolding. At the force maximum (peak force) at time t \u2248 1 ms, most of the protein native structure is disrupted, and so the concept of volume averaging is not valid. Hence, the discussion of stress dynamics is meaningful only before the global transitions occur in the system (e.g. unfolding of a protein or structural collapse of a virus shell).

The results obtained were used to compute all the distributions of mechanical stress measures in the capsid structure. To visualize the dynamics of stress propagation, we profiled various stress measures as functions of particle deformation-a suitable reaction coordinate, and analyzed the surface maps of these measures. An example of the evolution of mechanical stress in the particle's structure represented by the first stress invariant I (1) (equation (13)) is shown in figure 2 along with the forcedeformation curve (FX-curve) for a representative trajectory of CCMV indentation along the two-fold symmetry axis.",

In the course of mechanical deformation, the CCMV capsid's top and bottom portions interact with the cantilever tip (indenter) and the substrate surface, respectively (see snapshot 1 in figure 2 ). These structure portions rapidly become flat (snapshots 2 and 3) and they transmit mechanical stress to the side portions of the CCMV shell. At the same time, the CCMV capsid's side portions bend and accumulate most of the stress in the course of compression. This is precisely reflected in the dynamics of first stress invariant I (1) . The profiles of I (1) displayed in figure 2 show that corresponding to CCMV capsid deformation by X = 7 nm, the stress invariant for top and bottom portions of CCMV structure I (1) s \u2248 0.06 \u00b1 0.03 MPa, which accounts for only \u223c3% change from its initial value. Hence, we can conclude that the stress development and redistribution from the top and bottom portions of the CCMV structure to the side portions result in the particle's shape alteration under mechanical loading. These shape changes are reflected in stress decrease in the top and bottom portions of the capsid structure and stress accumulation in the side portion of the CCMV structure. This physical picture fully agrees with our previous finding regarding formation of multiple cracks (structure defects) in the side portion of the CCMV shell, eventually leading to the particle's structural collapse. A supplementary movie (stacks.iop.org/JPhysCM/30/044006/mmedia) shows the appearance of red spots, which correspond to large stress accumulation far exceeding the critical values, which leads to particle collapse (see movie S1). Hence, the results obtained for CCMV show that the stress distribution and the interplay between mechanical stress components in the top, bottom and side portions of the CCMV capsid set the limits of particle mechanical strength and structural stability.",

To further address the issue of entropic effects and to probe possible interplay among the entropy changes, deformation dynamics, and stress evolution in the CCMV particle's structure, we carried out simulations of CCMV nanoindentation at zero temperature T = 0 K.

To understand the origin of this drastic reduction in the critical force for the CCMV shell global transition to the collapsed state, we also analyzed and compared the surface maps showing the distributions of the first principal stress component in the CCMV shell \u03c3 (1) at T = 0 K and 300 K (see snapshots in figure 3(a) ). Structural snapshots 1-3 which correspond to the equally numbered regions in the FX-spectra show a more rapid yet gradual change in the stress intensity at finite temperature T = 300 K as compared to zero temperature. Interestingly, as is evident from the CCMV structure snapshots for X = 3.3 and 6.2 nm deformation, at T = 0 K the color (stress intensity) shows a step-wise (sudden) change as one goes from the top portion to the side portion of the CCMV structure.

More rapid propagation of mechanical stress to the side portions of the capsid structure due to thermal fluctuations (at T = 300 K, left snapshots) leads to CCMV particle's collapse at much lower forces. This behavior can be directly compared with the results of CCMV forced deformation without thermal fluctuation effects (at T = 0 K, right snapshots).

In the absence of thermal fluctuations, initially (for small deformation X) both the mechanical stress in top and side portions \u03c3 (1) t and \u03c3 (1) s gradually increase. Later on, at X \u2248 6.2 nm deformation, the slope of \u03c3 (1) t decreases, which implies that the stress stored in the top portion of the CCMV shell propagates slowly to the side portion ( figure 3(b) ; see also supplementary movie S2). Quite unexpectedly, the CCMV capsid response is dramatically different when the particle is deformed at finite temperature T = 300 K ( figure 3(c) , supplementary movie S2). Here, thermal fluctuations lead to a 0.22 MPa difference between \u03c3 (1) t and \u03c3 (1) s at small deformations (figure 3(c)), and they introduce significant inhomogeneity in the stress distribution as is evident from the structure snapshots displayed in figure 3 . In the course of indentation up to X = 6.2 nm deformation, the stress in the top portion of the CCMV structure rapidly decreases by \u2206\u03c3 (1) t = 0.32 MPa, whereas the stress in the side portion of the CCMV shell increases by \u2206\u03c3 (1) s = 0.02 MPa until the CCMV capsid collapse occurs at X = 6.2 nm. To summarize, the results obtained clearly demonstrate that thermal fluctuations modulate the mechanical properties of virus shells, which implies that the entropic effects are highly important.",

In these sets of computer experiments we mechanically tested the CCMV particle by performing the simulations of forward indentation when the compressive force is ramped up, which were then followed by the simulations of backward tip retraction when the compressive force is gradually quenched to zero. The simulations of backward tip retraction were performed starting from the partially deformed structures generated in the course of forward indentation with X = 3.8, 6.2, 7.4, and 9.5 nm deformation (see figure S2 ). The profiles of FX curves for two representative trajectories with X = 3.8 and 9.5 nm deformation are shown in figure 4(a) . The lack of hysteresis in the FX-curves show that the CCMV particle completely restores its initial shape in the course of force-quench tip retraction if the deformation in the forward indentation does not exceed X = 5.0 nm deformation. However, when CCMV deformation is larger than X 5.0 nm, the CCMV structure is not fully restored in the course of force-quench tip retraction, which (green curve) of CCMV structure calculated for the full cycle of forward indentation and backward tip retraction starting from the 9 nm deformed structure. The inset shows same stress quantities calculated for the full cycle of forward indentation and backward tip retraction starting from the 4 nm deformed structure. Highlighted cyan and magenta areas denote same intervals of backward tip retraction as on the top panel. The retraction simulations for the structures obtained at X < 4.5 nm (dashed curve) deformation exhibit almost linear (i.e. elastic) response of the capsid to mechanical perturbation (no hysteresis), while for the structures obtained after X = 4.5 nm we observe significant dissipation of energy (large hysteresis) meaning that the particle response is plastic). The point of transition from elastic to plastic regime corresponds to the equality of the stress components for the top and side portions of CCMV capsid. also results in the increased hysteresis as observed in the FX curves. Next, we analyzed the first principal stress components \u03c3 (1) , which showed that for X < 5.0 nm deformation the mechanical stress in the top portion of CCMV structure \u03c3 (1) t does not decrease beyond the stress level in the side portion of CCMV capsid \u03c3 (1) s . Indeed, the curves of \u03c3 (1) t and \u03c3 (1) s displayed in the inset in figure 4(b) never cross. This result is in contrast to indentations exceeding X = 5.0 nm deformation, for which the stress in the side portion of CCMV shell exceeds the stress in the top portion of CCMV structure as soon as the curves of \u03c3 (1) t and \u03c3 (1) s cross ( figure 4(b) ). The results of analysis of the first principle stress components \u03c3 (1) for different elements of the CCMV shell structure clearly demonstrate that the equality of the first principal stresses in the top portion of CCMV \u03c3 (1) t , to which the external compressive force is applied through a cantilever tip, and the side portions, where structural defects occur and accumulate in the course of mechanical deformation \u03c3 (1) s , can be used to formulate a yield strength (and yield deformation) criteria for virus capsids. Here, we considered the top versus side portions of the CCMV particle, but these results also hold for the bottom versus side portions of the CCMV structure (not shown).",

This means that the mechanical stress generated at the top by the cantilever tip rapidly prop agates from the top to the sides of the CCMV shell and gradually accumulates in the side portion of the CCMV structure. As soon as the von Mises stresses for the top and side portions become equal \u03c3 vM t = \u03c3 vM s (see curves' intersection in figure 5 ), a subsequent mechanical loading leads to \u03c3 vM s being greater than \u03c3 vM t . From this point on, any additional stress propagation and accumulation in the side portion of CCMV results in formation of cracks, which then leads to the CCMV transition to the globally collapsed state ( figure 5 ). Not coincidentally, the characteristic deformation X where \u03c3 vM t = \u03c3 vM s corresponds to the moment of time at which the indentation force begins to decrease. The force decrease signifies that the CCMV shell is starting to lose its mechanical resistance, which eventually results in the collapse transition (see FX-curves in figure 5) . Hence, the characteristic deformation X at which \u03c3 vM t = \u03c3 vM s corresponds to the regime where the particle deformation is approaching the critical deformation X \u2192 X * . This result is consistent for all nanoindentation assays summarized in figure 5 . We also analyzed the output from nanoindentation simulations for CCMV compressed along three-, five-, quasi-two-and quasi-three-fold symmetry axes and found similar results (not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the equality of von Mises stress for the top and side portions is a good predictor of the structural collapse transitions in virus shells.",

For example, the CCMV capsid is composed of multiple copies of a 190 amino acid long capsid protein; fibrin fibers are formed by fibrin monomers, \u223c3500 residue long, organized into double-stranded fibrin protofibrils; microtubule polymers are composed of 10-13 protofilaments, each formed by \u223c1000 residue long \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers. Clearly then, biological particles are discrete structures and there is a more philosophical question to consider: how large can a particle be so that the concepts of continuum mechanics can be applied to describe their physical and materials properties? For example, Cauchy stress is widely used in materials science to study the physical properties of materials undergoing small deformations. On the other hand, we have demonstrated in our previous studies of the CCMV capsid [36] and microtubule polymer fragments [24] that the long-wavelength global modes, which control the displacements of entire structural subunits (i.e. hexon and penton capsomers in the CCMV shell or microtubule protofilaments in microtubules), and the symmetry of their arrangement, rather than atomic level details, determine the mechanical properties of biological particles and their response to external physical inputs. Hence, largesize biological particles do permit a continuum representation, which allows use of the apparatus of continuum mechanics to describe their properties. Yet, computational molecular modeling of biological particles requires having a discrete representation of the polypeptide chains, either atomic or simplified (coarse-grained) bead-per-residue, and so there is an issue of how continuum measures can be calculated for the discrete structures.",

When defined locally for all particles i = 1, 2, \u2026, N where N is the system size (total number of residues in the system), i.e. atoms (all-atomic modeling) or amino acid residues (coarse-grained schemes), the atomic stress tensor \u03c3 i provides valuable information about the distribution of internal tension in the biological material. Furthermore, since the tensor components are averaged over the volume element \u03a9 of a large 20 \u00c5 cut-off radius, they carry information about the pair-wise particle-particle interactions between the ith particle and other particles within the cut-off sphere (see equation (11) ). Therefore, the stress tensor components are piecewise continuous functions of space and time. Stress tensors are typically used in continuum mechanics to analyze the effects of small deformation. In our nanomanipulations in silico, we too use experimentally relevant slow forceloading rates, which translate to the cantilever velocities of 10 \u22121 -10 1 \u00b5m s \u22121 , and so the local deformations are of low amplitude. Hence, the differences in the stress tensor components \u2206\u03c3 i (\u2206t) for two consecutive structural configurations separated by a short time interval \u2206t \u2248 40 \u03bcs are, indeed, very small (see movie S1).",

Analysis of the first stress invariant I (1) i (figure 2) revealed the interplay between the stress in the side portion and top portion of the CCMV shell compressed by the cantilever tip (indenter used in AFM). It turns out that, similar to energy, the mechanical stress is capable of transferring from one portion of the virus structure to another. We found that the mechanical stress created in the top portion of CCMV by the indenting tip-sphere rapidly transfers to the side portion of CCMV where it accumulates over time (figures 2-5). Another interesting finding is a strong correlation between the deformation-induced alterations in the CCMV structure and the overall shape and dynamics of stress propagation in the protein capsid.",

The C \u03b1 -based coarse-grained modeling proved to be accurate in describing the mechanical properties of large biological assemblies [24, 35, 36, 39, 51] . This allowed us to obtain, for the first time, detailed microscopic information about the dynamics of local stresses at the amino-acid-residue level. We observed formation of 'hot spots', i.e. locations in the virus particle structure with the maximum stress, which result in the long run in cracks and defects (figures 2 and S1, movies S1). Although the structural model (C \u03b1 -based coarse-grained SOP model) and Langevin dynamics we have utilized and the stress characteristics (stress invariants, principal stresses, von Mises and Tresca stresses) we have analyzed in this work are different from the bead-per-capsomer model and Monte-Carlo moves used by Zandi and Reguera [50] , the results of their study and our own work show very good qualitative agreement.

Hence, it should be expected that thermal effects play an important role in the capsid's evolution, and in defining the dynamics and setting the energy scale for global transitions in a virus capsid, such as buckling and structural collapse. We analyzed the effect of thermal fluctuations on the stress evolution in the CCMV capsid structure by carrying out nanoindentation measurements at zero temperature (T = 0 K) and finite temperature (T = 300 K). Quite surprisingly, we found that the mechanical response (as reflected by the FX-curves), the stress magnitude and the pattern of stress propagation and distribution in the virus capsid, all change with temperature (see figure 3 ). The area under the FX-curve recorded at a very slow force-loading rate is the reversible work w rev , which is equal to the equilibrium Gibbs free energy change for the collapse transition \u2206G eq , i.e. w rev = \u2206G eq = \u2206H \u2212 T\u2206S, where \u2206H and \u2206S are the enthalpy change and the entropy change, respectively. Hence, the entropic contribution T\u2206S to the free energy change \u2206G can be estimated by subtracting the work done on the capsid by the indenter at finite temperature from the work performed at zero temperature. For the native state as the initial state (snapshot 1 in figure 3 ) and the collapsed state as the final state (snapshot 3 in figure 3 ), we obtain from the FX-curves in figure 3 that for the CCMV structural collapse T\u2206S \u2248 920 kcal mol \u22121 . This is almost three-fold larger than the the enthalpy change \u2206H \u2248 370 kcal mol \u22121 .",

For example, the finite elements analysis [20] and variances of elastic network modeling [25] analyze the potential energy changes, while the entropy changes are ignored. In a sense, this is similar to setting T = 0 K in our nanoindentation experiments in silico. However, our results clearly demonstrate large differences in the FX-spectra collected at zero and finite temperature, as well as in the amplitude and pattern of stress evolution in the CCMV shell. For example, at T = 0 K the mechanical stress in the top and side portions of the CCMV structure both increase, whereas at T = 300 K the stress in the top decreases and the stress in the sides increases ( figure 3) . Hence, thermal fluctuations modulate the mechanical and materials properties of virus capsids, and the entropic effects are significant and not to be ignored. The importance of the entropic effects, clearly expressed in the quite different stress distributions presented for the T = 0 K and T = 300 K (see figure 3 ), suggest that investigators should be cautious in their application of continuum mechanics models, such as finite element analysis and elastic network modeling, to structural models of biological particles.",

The meaning of the term 'plastic' is that above a critical value of stress (or deformation), the deformed material will never return to its original shape and will not fully restore its initial structure when the applied stress is quenched. We tested if stress measures can be used to predict the onset of plasticity in viral shells. Using TensorCalculator, we computed the first principle stress components for the top and side portions of the CCMV structure \u03c3 (1) t and \u03c3 (1) s and profiled them as functions of deformation time (figure 4). Our results indicate that for a small (forward) deformation the curves of \u03c3 (1) t and \u03c3 (1) s do not cross, and when the compressive force is gradually quenched to zero during the backward tip retraction, the CCMV capsid fully restores back its initial state (both structure and shape). However, when the deformation is large so that the curves of \u03c3 (1) t and \u03c3 (1) s cross, the capsid does not return back to its initial state. Hence, the relationship between the first principal stress components for the top and side portions of the viral capsid structure, i.e. \u03c3 (1) t \u03c3 (1) s (17) sets the limit of elastic deformation in soft viral capsids.",
