A stage-structured model, a discrete epidemic model with seasonal variation in environment, a discrete tuberculosis transmission model, and many other discrete epidemic models have been constructed, studied, and applied [\uf640-\uf6dc\uf639]. One reason for the upsurge of discrete epidemic models is that discrete models have advantages in describing an infectious disease since epidemic data are usually collected in discrete time units, which would make it more convenient to use discrete-time models [\uf6dc\uf6dc] .",

It is very easy to determine whether the disease goes to extinction or keeps persistence in the population by the magnitude of the basic reproductive number, R \uf639 . The underlining mechanism of the nice threshold result given in Theorem \uf6dc is that the number of the infected population will gradually become lower and lower if the new infection created by an individual during his/her infection period is less than one. The epidemiological interpretation of Theorem \uf63a says that there is at least a certain number of infected population if the new infection created by an individual during his/her infection period is more than one. The necessary condition is to eliminate an infectious disease, to reduce R \uf639 , and to have R \uf639 < \uf6dc.

Theorem \uf63c implies that the endemic equilibrium E * (S * , I * , R * ) http://www.advancesindifferenceequations.com/content/2013/1/42 of (\uf6dc) is globally asymptotically stable. The number of the infectious individuals for two solutions with different initial values are shown in Figure \uf6dc(a) . From Figure \uf6dc(a) we see that the number of infected people approaches its equilibrium value as t tends to infinity. For the same values of \u03b4, \u03bc, \u03b3 , and , the straightforward calculation yields R \uf639 \u2208 (\uf6dc, \uf6dc.\uf63e) if \u03b2 \u2208 (\uf639.\uf639\uf6dc\uf63e, \uf639.\uf639\uf63a\uf63d\uf63e), which does not satisfy the condition R \uf639 > \u03bc+\u03b3 \u03bc of Theorem \uf63c. On the other hand, the simulation shows that the endemic equilibrium of model (\uf6dc) may be globally asymptotically stable even if the condition R \uf639 > \u03bc+\u03b3 \u03bc of Theorem \uf63c does not hold. The solution curves of the infected people for \u03b2 = \uf639.\uf639\uf63a and two different initial values are given in Figure \uf6dc(b) . Those simulations remind us that the condition R \uf639 > \u03bc+\u03b3 \u03bc of Theorem \uf63c may not be necessary for the global stability. It is a pity that we cannot prove the global stability without the condition R \uf639 > \u03bc+\u03b3 \u03bc . For the case \u03b4 > \uf639, we choose \u03b4 = \uf639.\uf639\uf639\uf6dc, \u03bc = \uf639.\uf639\uf6dc, \u03b3 = \uf639.\uf639\uf639\uf63e, and = \uf63a\uf639. Then we have max{ \u03b4 \u03bc-\u03b4-\u03b3 , \u03bc+\u03b4+\u03b3 \u03bc } = \uf6dc.\uf63f, (\uf6dc + \uf63a \u03bc+\u03b4+\u03b3 ) \u03bc \u03bc+\u03b4 = \uf6dc\uf639\uf63f.\uf640\uf63e, \u03bc \uf63a > (\u03bc+\u03b4)(\u03bc+\u03b4+\u03b3 ) \uf63a \uf63a+\u03bc+\u03b4+\u03b3 , and \u03bc > \u03b4 + \u03b3 . Theorem \uf63d implies that the endemic equilibrium E * is globally asymptotically stable when \uf6dc.\uf63f < R \uf639 < \uf6dc\uf639\uf63f.\uf640\uf63e. Figure From the epidemiological interpretation, we assume that the inequalities \uf639 < \u03bc+\u03b4 +\u03b3 < \uf6dc and \u03b2 + \u03bc < \uf6dc hold. If those two inequalities hold, then all solutions of model (\uf6dc) with positive initial values are non-negative, and the numerical simulations show that model (\uf6dc) does not exhibit complex dynamics. If those two inequalities do not hold, then model (\uf6dc) may exhibit much more complicated dynamical behaviors. The numerical simulation demonstrates that there exists a sequence of period-doubling bifurcation to chaos. Let us take \u03bc = \uf639.\uf639\uf6dc, \u03b3 = \uf639.\uf639\uf639\uf6dc, \u03b4 = \uf639.\uf639\uf639\uf6dc, and = \uf63a\uf639 to investigate the period doubling process of model (\uf6dc). For small R \uf639 (a linear function of \u03b2), the endemic equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable (see Figure \uf63a(a) ). When R \uf639 passes through \uf6dc\uf640\uf63e.\uf640, the endemic equilibrium losses its stability, and a stable periodic solution of period \uf63a appears (see Figure \uf63a(b) ). When R \uf639 passes through \uf63a\uf63a\uf63e.\uf640, the periodic solution of period \uf63a losses its stability, and a stable periodic solution of period four appears (see Figure \uf63a(c) ). As R \uf639 increases further, the periodic solution of period \uf63c becomes unstable, and a periodic solution of period \uf640 appears. The numerical simulation shows that the period-doubling bifurcation may continue and go to chaos (see Figure \uf63a(d) ).",

The model parameters are estimated according to the demographic and epidemiological data in China from \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d to \uf63a\uf639\uf6dc\uf639. We have compared the model simulation result of the number of annual mumps cases to the reported number of notifiable diseases. http://www.advancesindifferenceequations.com/content/2013/1/42 Mumps, caused by the mumps virus, is an acute respirator infectious disease and it is spread from person to person by coughing or sneezing. Mumps usually starts with a fever and headache for a day or two. It then presents with swelling and soreness of the parotid salivary gland. The main symptom of mumps is the swollen, painful salivary glands on one or both sides of the face. The entire course of mumps infection is \uf6dc\uf639 to \uf6dc\uf63c days. The infected people will obtain permanent immunity after they get recovered from infection. The SIR model is suitable to describe the infection of mumps due to its permanent immunity. The host population is chosen to be individuals who are younger than \uf63a\uf639 since mumps is common in children and adolescents, but rare among adults. The values of model parameters are estimated from the demographic and epidemiological data in China from \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d to \uf63a\uf639\uf6dc\uf639.",

From the statistical yearbook of China, we know that the number of the host population (less than twenty years old) in \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d is \uf63b\uf63d\uf641 million [\uf6dc\uf640] . The annual birth rate in China from \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d to \uf63a\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 is approximately \uf6dc\uf63a/\uf6dc,\uf639\uf639\uf639, and the recruitment rate is taken as = \uf63c\uf63c,\uf639\uf63d\uf63c [\uf6dc\uf640-\uf63a\uf6dc]. The annual death rate of the population is \uf63f.\uf639\uf63e/\uf6dc,\uf639\uf639\uf639 [\uf63a\uf63a, \uf63a\uf63b], hence, the daily death rate is \uf6dc\uf641.\uf63b\uf63c/\uf6dc,\uf639\uf639\uf639,\uf639\uf639\uf639. Since the age of the host population is less than twenty, an individual should be removed when his/her age is over twenty. The daily removed rate is taken to be \uf6dc/\uf63f,\uf63b\uf639\uf639, and the value of parameter \u03bc is estimated to be \u03bc = \uf639.\uf639\uf639\uf639\uf639\uf6dc\uf641\uf63b\uf63c + \uf639.\uf639\uf639\uf639\uf6dc\uf63b\uf63f = \uf639.\uf639\uf639\uf639\uf6dc\uf63d\uf63e\uf63b\uf63c. From the fact that the entire course of mumps infection is \uf6dc\uf639 to \uf6dc\uf63c days, we take \u03b3 = \uf6dc/\uf6dc\uf63a = \uf639.\uf639\uf640\uf63b\uf63b [\uf63a\uf63c] . From the report on notifiable infectious diseases in China, we take \u03b4 = \uf639.\uf639\uf639\uf639\uf639\uf639\uf639\uf63b.",

By using the method of parameter estimation in [\uf63a\uf63e], we have \u03b2 = \uf639.\uf639\uf640\uf63d\uf6dc\uf640. After the parameters and initial values are set, we apply the SIS model to simulate the mumps infection in China from \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d to \uf63a\uf639\uf6dc\uf63d. The simulation results are shown in Figure \uf63b . The top left plot is the number of the susceptibles, S(t), which shows a slow downward tendency. From the demographic data in China, we know that the number of the population younger than twenty is \uf63b\uf63d\uf641 million in \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d, \uf63b\uf63a\uf639 million in \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf641, and \uf63b\uf639\uf63a million in \uf63a\uf639\uf6dc\uf639 [\uf6dc\uf640, \uf63a\uf639, \uf63a\uf63b]. The change of the host population in our simulation is consistent with the observed data. The top right is the number of the infective, I(t), which shows the slow upward tendency. The bottom left is the number of the recovered R(t). The curve in the bottom right plot is the number of new mumps infection cases from \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d to \uf63a\uf639\uf6dc\uf63d by a model simulation. The piecewise curve with stars is the number of annually reported mumps cases out of notifiable infectious diseases from \uf63a\uf639\uf639\uf63d to \uf63a\uf639\uf6dc\uf6dc [\uf63a\uf63d] . The comparison between the model simulation and the notifiable disease report demonstrates that our model can give a good prediction for infection diseases.",

In this paper, http://www.advancesindifferenceequations.com/content/2013/1/42 we have formulated a discrete SIR epidemic model and studied its asymptotical behaviors.

The complicated dynamics of the simple SIR model reminds us that we cannot expect to have the global stability of the endemic equilibrium when R \uf639 > \uf6dc. Other conditions should be given for the global stability. In this paper we have obtained sufficient conditions for the global stability of the endemic equilibrium. Although those conditions given in our paper are not satisfactory, our result is a good exploration of the challengeable problem. We expect to prove the global stability of the endemic equilibrium when R \uf639 is not large. The comparison principle used in this paper and the Lyapunov function may help us to have better results.",
