The presence of different groupings of HRV was also described within HRV-A. 12 A remarkable finding is the high HRV-B diversity found in our study, with 13 of 25 serotypes detected, compared with other surveys. Studies performed in Edinburgh 6 and Switzerland 13 detected six different serotypes each, while four different types were found in China, 14 South Africa, 15 and the USA, 16 respectively. This lower diversity may be due to the number of years spanned in these studies -usually one or two -compared with our study of a 6AE5-year period. The most prevalent genotype in our study was the new clade 1, detected in six patients, followed by serotypes 6 and 35, detected in four patients each. On the contrary, in the mentioned surveys, HRV-B52 was the most prevalent serotype which was not detected in our study. Other serotypes detected were HRV-B27, HRV-B83, HRV-B6, and HRV-B4, all of them also detected in our study. These differences may be due to a specific geographical circulating distribution, as it is described for HRV-C, 4 or to a distinct seasonal distribution, where several serotypes could circulate in a continuous way, whereas other serotypes could be detected only in specific seasons. 17 In addition to this diversity, we have described three putative new clades, which are supported by a high
