This study investigated the effect of PALM3 knockdown on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and its underlying mechanisms. We constructed a recombinant adenoviral vector containing short hairpin RNA for PALM3 to knockdown PALM3 expression. A transgene-free adenoviral vector was used as a negative control. The ALI rat model was established by LPS peritoneal injection at 48-h posttransfection. Results showed that downregulation of PALM3 improved the survival rate, attenuated lung pathological changes, alleviated pulmonary edema, lung vascular leakage and neutrophil infiltration, inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of nuclear factor \u03baB and interferon \u03b2 regulatory factor 3, and promoted the secretion of antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in the ALI rat model. However, PALM3 knockdown had no effect on TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon \u03b2 (TRIF) expression. Moreover, PALM3 knockdown reduced the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF induced by LPS in rat lungs. Therefore, the downregulation of PALM3 protected rats from LPS-induced ALI and its mechanisms were partially associated with the modulation of inflammatory responses and inhibition of TLR4/MyD88 and TLR4/ TRIF complex formation.",

Because of the lack of specific and effective treatments for ALI/ ARDS, the mortality rate among these patients remains as high as 30-40% [3] . The pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS is complex, and one of the most crucial factors is an uncontrolled inflammatory response [4, 5] .

            "text": "The Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway plays a key role in host defense, innate immunity, and inflammation [4, 6, 7] . Prototypic signaling in inflammation occurs through the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-TLR4 pathway. LPS induces the dimerization of TLR4 that initiates signal transduction involving multiple adaptors, leading to the activation of inflammatory transcription factors including nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03baB) and interferon \u03b2 regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which mediates the upregulation of inflammatory cytokine gene expression leading to an inflammatory response [8, 9] . However, unchecked, excessive or inappropriate TLR signaling activation can lead to severe inflammation and immunity-related tissue damage [4, 10] . Single immunoglobulin interleukin (Ig IL)-1 receptor-related molecule (SIGIRR) is an important negative regulator of TLR signaling [10] . Through the negative regulation of TLR signaling, SIGIRR can depress the inflammatory response to LPS, block the transduction cascade, inhibit NF-\u03baB activation, decrease the production of inflammatory mediators, and ultimately attenuate organ injury [11] . Trapping key components of the TLR signaling pathway is the mechanism by which SIGIRR inhibits TLR signaling transduction [4, 5] . The Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain of SIGIRR is necessary for SIGIRR to interact with TIR-domain containing adaptors [12] .",

            "text": "Paralemmin (PALM)-3 belongs to the PALM protein family and was first described in Xenopus laevis as Xlgv7/ Xlcaax-1 by Cornish et al. [13] . In our previous study, we used the C-terminal part of SIGIRR containing the TIR domain as bait to screen SIGIRR-binding proteins in a human lung cDNA library and found that PALM-3 is a novel interactive partner of SIGIRR [12] . We also showed that silencing PALM3 expression inhibited the release of inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS in vitro [12] . Moreover, previous research demonstrated that the downregulation of PALM3 was protective against LPS-induced ALI in mice [14] . Although the downregulation of PALM3 has been shown to benefit LPS-induced ALI in mice, the explicit underlying mechanisms against ALI, including whether the downregulation of PALM3 has a protective effect against LPS-induced ALI in other animal models, a negative effect on the expression of adaptors in the LPS-TLR4 pathway, blocks LPS-TLR4 signal transduction, and regulates the inflammatory transcription factors NF-\u03baB and IRF3, remain unclear. Indeed, species diversity usually leads to different research results, even under the same experimental conditions. For example, comprehensive physiologic studies of lung injury are better in rats than in mice [15] . Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of the downregulated expression of PALM3 on LPS-induced ALI using a rat model.",

The short hairpin oligonucleotide and complementary strand targeting the consensus sequences of PALM3 were designed and inserted into the shuttle plasmid pGV120 (GeneChem) to generate the plasmid pGV120-PALM3-shRNA. The pGV120-PALM3-shRNA plasmid was identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. Recombinant viruses were generated using 293 packaging cells cotransfected with the shuttle plasmid and the framing plasmid (pBHGlox) via the AdMax\u2122 system (Microbix). Viral stocks were purified using CsCl gradients. The recombinant virus was named Ad.PALM3-shRNA. A control vector containing no transgene (Ad.V) was constructed using the same method. Titers of the recombinant adenoviruses were determined by means of 50% tissue culture infectious dose, and for Ad.PALM3-shRNA and Ad.V, this was 3 \u00d7 10 10 plaqueforming units (PFU)/mL and 6 \u00d7 10 10 PFU/mL, respectively.",

After acclimatization for 1 week in the animal housing facility, rats were anesthetized by ether (Fuyu Chemical Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) inhalation as follows: cotton wool containing ether was placed in an animal anesthesia bottle and the rats were placed into this bottle for 5 min. After the rats were lightly anesthetized, they were removed and inoculated intranasally with a total of 3 \u00d7 10 8 PFU (in 100 \u03bcL) of Ad.PALM3-shRNA (Ad.PALM3-shRNA group) or Ad.V (Ad.V group) using a 1-mL blunt head syringe as previously described [4, 17] . Forty-eight hours later, LPS (Escherichia coli 0127: B8, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 15 mg/kg (dissolved in saline) was injected into the peritoneal cavity of conscious rats to establish the A L I r a t m o d e l .

Approximately 10 mg samples of rat lung lysates were incubated with a primary rat-specific anti-TLR4 (25) antibody (1:100 in TBST) (cat. no. sc-293,072; monoclonal mouse anti-rat; Santa Cruz), and the same amount of lysate was incubated with normal rat IgG (Santa Cruz) as a negative control at 4\u00b0C for 2 h and then with 20 \u03bcl of protein A/G-agarose (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C with rocking overnight. The pellets obtained after centrifugation were washed five times with washing buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 7 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF). The pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were obtained as immunoprecipitates for western blotting analysis by using anti-TLR4 antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-MyD88 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-TRIF antibody (Abcam).",

The results showed that LPS induced the expression of SOCS3 in all LPS-treated rats (P < 0.05 vs. normal rat) (Fig. 7c) .

Thus, the NF-\u03baB-DNA-binding activity and NF-\u03baB phospho-p65 protein level in rat lungs was determined as described above. The ELISA result showed that all LPS-injected rats exhibited an increase in NF-\u03baB-DNA-binding in comparison with LPS-free rats (P < 0.05 vs. 0-h time point) (Fig. 8a) . Ad.PALM3-shRNA pretreatment significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in NF-\u03baB activation compared with the Ad.V group (P < 0.05 vs. Ad.V group at each time point) (Fig. 8a) . ELISA demonstrated that the activity of NF-\u03baB reached a peak at 24 h after LPS stimulation (Fig. 8a) . Therefore, we also examined the NF-\u03baB phospho-p65 protein level in nuclear extracts at this time point using western blot analysis to confirm the inhibitory action of Ad.PALM3-shRNA on LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activation. As shown in Fig. 8b , at 24 h after LPS stimulation, the NF-\u03baB and phospho-p65 protein levels in the Ad.PALM3-shRNA group were reduced by about 30% compared with those in LPS-treated and LPS + Ad.V-treated rats (P < 0.05) (Fig. 8b) . IRF3 is also an important transcription factor in cells and activates the IFN-\u03b2 gene to regulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines induced by LPS [23] . We therefore examined the phospho-IRF3 protein levels in nuclear extracts using western blot analysis to detect the influence of PALM3 on LPS-induced IRF3 activation. At 24 h after LPS stimulation, phospho-IRF3 protein levels were significantly increased in all rats. However, Ad.rPALM3 pretreatment reduced the elevated phospho-IRF3 protein levels (P < 0.05 vs. LPS-treated and LPS + Ad.Vtreated rats) (Fig. 8c) .

As shown in Fig. 9 , LPS significantly induced the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF in lung tissues (P < 0.05 vs. normal rats). However, PALM3 shRNA and control adenovirus did not have significant effects on TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF protein expression in LPS-induced ALI rats (P > 0.05 vs. LPS-treated and LPS + Ad.V-treated rats) (Fig. 9) .",

            "text": "The present study revealed that PALM3 expression in rat lung was upregulated in a time-dependent manner in response to LPS. Furthermore, the downregulation of PALM3 improved the survival rate of rats, ameliorated the severity of lung injury, alleviated pulmonary edema, lung vascular leakage and neutrophil infiltration, inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b2) and activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3, and promoted the secretion of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the expression of SOCS3 in the LPS-induced ALI rat model. However, the downregulation of PALM3 did impact the upregulation of TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF protein expression induced by LPS in rat lung tissues. Moreover, the downregulation of PALM3 impeded the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF induced by LPS in rat lungs. These results suggest that the downregulation of PALM3 exerts a potential protective effect against LPSinduced ALI in rats and may be a promising potential treatment for ALI. Its protective effects were partially associated with the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and negative regulator of inflammation (SOCS3), and the inhibition of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activities. Its mechanisms may be attributed to the modulation of inflammatory responses and inhibition of TLR4/ MyD88 and TLR4/TRIF complex formation.",

            "text": "PALMs are a small protein family that includes PALM1, PALM2, PALM3, and palmdelphin (PALMD) [29] , which are highly expressed in the brain, kidney, adrenal gland, mammary gland, and breast cancers [30] [31] [32] . Previous studies have verified that PALM1 is implicated in controlling cell shape, plasma membrane dynamics, cell motility, invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells, modulation of cell migration and maturation, and tumor lymphangiogenesis [30, 31, 33] . However, little is known about the biological functions of the other PALM isoforms. Hultqvist and colleagues [34] considered that there is functional diversification and specific biological roles among PALM isoforms. PALM3 was first reported in 1992 by Cornish et al. [13] and was speculated to act as an adaptor to link intrinsic membrane proteins to each other, to the cytoskeleton, or to motor proteins [12, 29] . We reported for the first time in 2011 that PALM3 is a novel interactive partner of SIGIRR, and we also found that LPS upregulated the expression of PALM3 [12] . Our present study confirms the findings of our previous studies, which demonstrated the modulation of PALM3 expression in response to LPS [12, 14] . Our results revealed that PALM3 expression was detected in the lung tissue of normal rats, and that the control adenovirus Ad.V had no effect on PALM3 expression. After LPS stimulation, PALM3 protein and mRNA expression levels in the lungs of the Ad.V group were significantly upregulated in a time-dependent manner, which was in line with our previous result in vitro [12] . Moreover, the expression pattern of PALM3 was similar with those of the adaptors in TLR signaling, including MyD88 and TRIF [35] [36] [37] [38] . The pattern of PALM3 upregulation might be related to its functional involvement in LPS-TLR4 signal transduction, similar to the adaptors [12] . In our present study, PALM3 gene and protein expression in lung tissues was downregulated by administering a recombinant adenovirus expressing shRNA for rat PALM3. Although PALM3 expression in the Ad.PALM3-shRNA group increased after LPS stimulation for 6 h, this expression level remained lower than that of the normal and Ad.V group rats during the experiment. This result demonstrated that the PALM3 gene transcript in lung tissue was silenced successfully using the interference adenoviral vector-mediated RNA through intranasal instillation. Increased PALM3 expression levels in the lungs of the Ad.PALM3-shRNA group may also be caused by enhanced PALM3 gene transcription during the process of inflammatory signal transduction.",

            "text": "An uncontrolled inflammatory response is one of the most crucial factors in the pathogenesis of ALI [3, 4] . During the early stage of ALI, inflammatory and immune responses involve a vast of array of mediators; therefore, inhibition of the inflammatory cascade response is critical for the treatment of this disorder [39] . Downregulation of PALM3 gene transcription to impede TLR signal transduction at the early stage may inhibit the excessive inflammatory responses and improve the outcome of inflammatory diseases, including ALI/ ARDS. Thus, we determined the survival rate, lung histological changes, pulmonary edema, lung vascular leakage, neutrophil infiltration, and MPO activity in the lung to assess the effect of downregulation of PALM3 on LPS-induced ALI in rats. Our findings showed that the downregulation of PALM3 expression significantly improved the aforementioned assessment indexes, similar to previous studies [12, 14] . However, in these previous studies, the underlying mechanisms have not been explored. LPS induces the dimerization of TLR4, resulting in conformational changes of the TLR4 homodimer that induces the recruitment of adaptor proteins containing TIR domains. TIR domains of TLR4 recruit TIR domaincontaining adaptor proteins, MyD88-adaptor-like (MAL) and MyD88 (MyD88-dependent pathway), or TRIF and Toll-IL-1 receptor-containing adapter molecule 2 (TICAM-2) (MyD88-independent pathway) [27] . Activation of the MyD88-dependent pathway induces the activation and translocation of transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in the nucleus and induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines [27] . Activation of the MyD88independent pathway leads to the activation and translocation of the transcription factor IRF3 in the nucleus to induce the production of type I interferon [27] . The MyD88-independent pathway also plays a key role in the late-phase activation of NF-\u03baB [9] . In the present study, we found that the downregulation of PALM3 suppressed NF-\u03baB-DNA-binding activity and decreased NF-\u03baB phospho-p65 and phospho-IRF3 protein levels in the nucleus of ALI rat lung tissues. These findings suggested that the downregulation of PALM3 inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 in the ALI rat model. The increase of proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF are thought to be indices of local pulmonary inflammation in ALI [4, 20, 22] , and the levels of inflammatory mediators in serum generally reflect the extent of systemic inflammatory response and the prognosis of inflammatory diseases [20, 22, 40, 41] . In our present study, a significantly increased survival rate was observed in the Ad.PALM3-shRNA group, accompanied with a decrease in inflammatory mediator levels in the BALF and serum. These results suggest that this therapy directed to the lung through intranasal instillation inhibited local inflammation in the lungs and suppressed systemic inflammation to improve the outcome of ALI. Mitigation of pulmonary inflammation and reduction of alveolar capillary permeability decreased the translocation of inflammatory mediators from lung tissues into the systemic circulation ameliorating severity of the systemic inflammatory response [42, 43] . The negative effect of the downregulated expression of PALM3 on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the infiltration of neutrophils might be ascribed to its negative regulatory function on transcription factors NF-\u03baB and IRF3. Alleviation of inflammatory responses can finally lead to the amelioration of lung tissue damage. Our results also revealed that the downregulation of PALM3 did not impact the upregulation of TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF protein expression after ALI in lung tissues. Previous studies have shown that PALMs are associated with lipid rafts and have been proposed to function as adaptors between membrane proteins or with the cortical cytoskeleton [30, 34] . With this in mind, we speculated that the inhibition of PALM3 expression to impair its function with adaptors in the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway may be a potential mechanism for the downregulation of PALM3 protection against LPSinduced inflammatory responses and lung injury. Downregulating the PALM3 suppression of transcription factors NF-\u03baB and IRF3 might not be mediated by inhibiting the expression of the adaptors TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF in LPS-induced inflammation. Therefore, we further investigated the effect of the downregulation of PALM3 on the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF in lung tissues of ALI rats. The result of coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that PALM3 knockdown inhibited the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF. Our previous study demonstrated that PALM3 interacted with the TIR domain of SIGIRR [12] . Moreover, our in vitro study reveals that PALM3 interacts with MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF-6, and TICAM-2, important adaptors in the TLR signaling pathway, in a ligand-dependent manner (accepted but unpublished data). Therefore, we presumed that PALM3 might act as a Bbridge^to link TLR4 to the adaptor proteins (MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF-6, and TIACM-2) in LPS-TLR4 signal transduction. Downregulation of PALM3 expression might diminish the bridging efficacy of PALM3 during LPS-TLR4 signal transduction, which might reduce further the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF. Inhibition of TLR4/MyD88 and TLR4/TRIF complex formation may be a potential mechanism of the suppression of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation in LPS-induced inflammation. Further investigation is still needed to illuminate the detailed molecular mechanisms of the regulatory effect of PALM3 on LPS-TLR4 signaling.",

In this study, we also found that LPS-induced IL-10 expression in the BALF and serum was significantly increased after PALM3 gene silencing. This finding suggests that PALM3 inhibits anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 secretion in LPS-induced ALI. However, the downregulation of PALM3 decreased the inhibitory effect of PALM3 on IL-10 secretion. Promotion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 secretion may also be a possible mechanism of downregulation of PALM3 protection against LPS-induced lung injury.

Therefore, in the present study, we used the LPS-induced ALI rat model to investigate the effect of the downregulation of PALM3 on ALI. The rat ALI model may be superior to the mouse ALI model based on the following reasons. First, the availability of the rat genome will be extremely useful, as opportunities for comprehensive physiologic studies of lung injury are better in rats than in mice [15, 46] . Second, rats have a larger blood volume in contrast to mice, which benefits the analysis of cytokine levels in serum, to further illustrate the relationship between the local and systemic inflammation and the mechanisms of ALI.",

At present, there are no relevant literature reports on PALM3 knockouts; therefore, whether PALM3 knockout possesses potentially fatal consequences remains unclear. The effect of PALM3 knockout on the entire animal and the pathophysiological changes of ALI in PALM3 knockout animals will be investigated in future studies by constructing PALM3 gene knockout rat models. With respect to ALI/ARDS, transgene expression does not need to last a lifetime and a single administration of adenoviral vector could cover the critical period of ALI/ ARDS [42] . We therefore chose an adenoviral vector as a transient gene transfer tool in our study. Our results showed that although PALM3 expression increased in the PALM3knockdown group after LPS stimulation for 6 h, this expression level did not exceed that of normal rats at all time points. This finding indicates that the RNA interference activity of Ad.PALM3-shRNA lasted for the duration of the experiment. Moreover, in this study, we did not determine the effect of PALM3 on inflammatory cells and immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, as it was not clear whether PALM3 was expressed in these cells; however, this was not the main emphasis of the present study. Future research will focus on this emerging issue using in vitro experiments.",

This protective effect of PALM3-knockdown on ALI might be mediated by attenuating pulmonary pathological injury, alleviating alveolar capillary permeability, and decreasing neutrophil infiltration. Downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine secretion, upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion and SOCS3 expression, and inhibition of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activities likely represent the mechanisms for the downregulation of PALM3 protection against LPSinduced inflammatory responses and lung tissue injury. Downregulating PALM3 suppression of LPS-TLR4 signaling might not be mediated by modulating the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF, but rather through inhibiting the interaction of TLR4 with MyD88 or TRIF. These results suggest that modulating PALM3 expression may be a promising potential treatment for ALI/ARDS. Future research will focus on the emerging issues from this study and on the detailed molecular mechanisms of the PALM3 regulation of LPS-TLR4 signaling.",
