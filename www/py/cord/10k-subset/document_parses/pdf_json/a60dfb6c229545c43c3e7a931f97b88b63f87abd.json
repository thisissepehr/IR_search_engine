Although these forests are generally found sparsely distributed along rivers, their occurrence is not thought to be (clearly) driven by edaphic conditions but rather by trait combinations of G. dewevrei that aid in achieving monodominance. Functional community structure between these monodominant and mixed forests has, however, not yet been compared. Additionally, little is known about nondominant species in the monodominant forest community. These two topics are addressed in this study. We investigate the functional community structure of 10 one-hectare plots of monodominant and mixed forests in a central region of the Congo basin, in DR Congo. Thirteen leaf and wood traits are measured, covering 95% (basal area weighted) of all species present in the plots, including leaf nutrient contents, leaf isotopic compositions, specific leaf area, wood density, and vessel anatomy. The trait-based assessment of G. dewevrei shows an ensemble of traits related to water use and transport that could be favorable for its location near forest rivers. Moreover, indications have been found for N and P limitations in the monodominant forest, possibly related to ectomycorrhizal associations formed with G. dewevrei. Reduced leaf N and P contents are found at the community level for the monodominant forest and for different nondominant groups, as compared to those in the mixed forest. In summary, this work shows that environmental filtering does prevail in the monodominant G. dewevrei forest, leading to lower functional diversity in this forest type, with the dominant species showing beneficial traits related to its common riverine locations and with reduced soil N and P availability found in this environment, both coregulating the tree community assembly.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Democratic Republic of Congo, environmental filtering, functional traits, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, plant population and community dynamics, single-species dominance, species establishment", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Tropical rain forests are complex systems with high diversity of tree species growing in three continents along the equator.

Such monodominance in old-growth forests can be caused by distinct edaphic conditions (Richards, 1996) , for example, in water-logged forest (Connell & Lowman, 1989; Richards, 1996) and low-nutrient forests (McGuire, 2007) . Another type of monodominance is related to the disturbance regime of the forest, with low disturbance rates favoring competitive exclusion (Connell & Lowman, 1989; Hart, Hart, & Murphy, 1989 ).

The best-studied of these monodominant forests in Africa is that dominated by Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (De Wild.) J. Leonard from which naturally occurring monodominant patches are commonly found across central Africa, alongside forests with high species diversity (Fayolle et al., 2014; Hart, 1985; Peh, Sonk\u00e9, Lloyd, Quesada, & Lewis, 2011; Viennois, Barbier, Fabre, & Couteron, 2013) . Some environmental differences between these monodominant forests and adjacent mixed forests have been described, although the presence of an environmental filter (i.e., ecological filters related to the abiotic environment selecting for species suitable for this environment; Keddy, 1992) for establishment of the monodominance is not always evident. For example, these forests are often found along rivers (Fayolle et al., 2014) , although not exclusively (Hart et al., 1989) . Additionally, Peh, Sonk\u00e9 et al. (2011) did not find evidence for differences in soil characteristics between this monodominant forest and the adjacent mixed forest, similar to findings of Hart (1985) and Conway (1992) , while Torti et al. (2001) did report lower availability of nitrogen in the monodominant forest. Moreover, how the presence of this monodominance and its according environmental conditions impacts the overall tree community, species composition, and richness is not well understood. Variable species diversity of monodominant forests compared to the adjacent mixed forest has been reported, with both similar (Connell & Lowman, 1989; Makana, Terese, Hibbs, & Condit, 2004) and lower species diversity (Djuikouo, Sonk\u00e9, Doucet, Nguembou, & Lewis, 2010; Hart et al., 1989; Peh, 2009 ). Nevertheless, low species diversity does not necessarily indicate an equivalently low functional diversity in the community. Functional diversity, defined as the value, range, and distribution of functional traits in a given ecosystem (D\u0131\u00e1z et al., 2007) , namely also depends on variability of trait values of all species present, both within and between species, and on the extent of overlap of functional niches.

Secondly, lower functional richness is found in the monodominant forest, indicating a narrower functional niche space compared to the adjacent mixed forest (Mason et al., 2005; Vill\u00e9ger et al., 2008) . Furthermore, the similarity in functional evenness and divergence between the two forest types shows that, even within the reduced niche space in the monodominant forests, a similar niche differentiation and trait distribution occur compared to the adjacent mixed forest (Paine, Baraloto, Chave, & Herault, 2011; Vill\u00e9ger et al., 2008) . These indices thus show that the monodominant forest mainly differs from the adjacent mixed forest in the narrower range of its niche space, where a lower species diversity is present, which could be the result of environmental filtering (Mason et al., 2005; Vill\u00e9ger et al., 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 202, "end": 220, "text": "Hart et al.

Additionally, with \u03b4 13 C being a proxy of the intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE; the ratio of photosynthetic carbon fixation to stomatal conductance; Dawson, Mambelli, Plamboeck, Templer, & Tu, 2002; Farquhar, Ehleringer, & Hubick, 1989 ) and \u03b4 18 O providing a time-integrated measure of stomatal conductance (Barbour, 2007; Farquhar, Cernusak, & Barnes, 2007; Hasselquist, Allen, & Santiago, 2010) Secondly, indications are found of environmental filtering through a reduction in N and P soil availability in the monodominant forest. We speculate that this difference with mixed forests is possibly caused by differences in mycorrhizal associations. Studies comparing monodominant and adjacent mixed forests often cannot identify differences in soil characteristics (Conway, 1992; Hart, 1985; Peh, Sonk\u00e9 et al., 2011 ; although see Torti et al., 2001) . However, in our study area, lower bioavailable P concentrations were found in the 0-30 cm depth layer of the monodominant forest. Furthermore, we argue that based on leaf nutrient traits, two indications for N and P limitations can be found in our investigated forest systems. First, G. dewevrei was found to be significantly depleted in foliar \u03b4 15 N indicating its association with ectomycorrhizal fungi (Craine et al., 2009; Hobbie & H\u00f6gberg, 2012) , confirming what has previously been reported for G. dewevrei (Onguene & Kuyper, 2001; Torti & Coley, 1999) . Ectomycorrhizal fungi could affect the availability of inorganic N and possibly P present in soil (Corrales, Mangan, Turner, & Dalling, 2016) . In our study, no difference was found in soil N between mixed and monodominant forest. However, only total N (including organic and inorganic N) has been measured (as is the case in Conway, 1992; Hart, 1985 (Brookshire & Thomas, 2013; Menge, 2011) . Moreover, the presence of ectomycorrhizal fungi possibly suppresses decomposition rates even further due to competition with saprotrophic fungi (Fernandez & Kennedy, 2016) . The alteration of the local environment resulting from the dominance of G. dewevrei has been suggested to be a monodominance-enhancing mechanism Torti et al., 2001) . G. dewevrei can namely thrive in this nutrientlimited environment with its slow growth rates (deducted from its dense wood and thus high construction cost; Enquist, West, Charnov, & Brown, 1999) and high nutrient use efficiency (Poorter, Bongers, Sterck, & W\u00f6ll, 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 126, "text": "(Tyree & Zimmermann, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 191, "end": 212, "text": "(Tyree & Sperry, 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 306, "end": 328, "text": "(Hacke & Sperry, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 484, "end": 533, "text": "Dawson, Mambelli, Plamboeck, Templer, & Tu, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 534, "end": 570, "text": "Farquhar, Ehleringer, & Hubick, 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 644, "end": 659, "text": "(Barbour, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 660, "end": 695, "text": "Farquhar, Cernusak, & Barnes, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 696, "end": 733, "text": "Hasselquist, Allen, & Santiago, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1116, "text": "(Conway, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1128, "text": "Hart, 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1152, "text": "Peh, Sonk\u00e9 et al., 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1187, "text": "Torti et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1617, "text": "(Craine et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1641, "text": "Hobbie & H\u00f6gberg, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1729, "text": "(Onguene & Kuyper, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1750, "text": "Torti & Coley, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1894, "text": "(Corrales, Mangan, Turner, & Dalling, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2092, "text": "Conway, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2103, "text": "Hart, 1985", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2131, "text": "(Brookshire & Thomas, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2144, "text": "Menge, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2318, "text": "(Fernandez & Kennedy, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2466, "end": 2485, "text": "Torti et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2644, "end": 2682, "text": "Enquist, West, Charnov, & Brown, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2716, "end": 2756, "text": "(Poorter, Bongers, Sterck, & W\u00f6ll, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Water use efficiency -related traits of species not found in the monodominant forest provide an indication of the influence of an environmental filter related to the riverine locations.

Secondly, collected trait data point toward a reduction in N and P availability in soils of the monodominant forest, possibly caused by ectomycorrhizal associations with G. dewevrei. Additionally, as proposed in Hypothesis II, a pattern between the trait ensemble of the monodominant G. dewevrei and the subordinate species that co-occur with it in the same plots could be observed.

A fraction of total N could be sequestered in the ectomycorrhizal fungal biomass. In return, in the mixed forest, N and P limitations might be less as most tropical trees form arbuscular mycorrhizal associations(Corrales et al., 2016) that contribute to a smaller extent to N limitations(Smith & Read, 2008; although seeHodge & Fitter, 2010). Accordingly (and secondly), reduced leaf N and P contents are found at the community level for the monodominant forest, although these CWMs are highly influenced by G. dewevrei itself. Lower LNC values are, however, found for both the unique and shared species in the monodominant forest compared to the CWM of the mixed forest, as are the LPC values of the shared species in the monodominant forests. These reduced foliar N and P contents might indicate combined N and P limitations, possibly a direct influence of the immobilization of N and P by ectomycorrhizal fungi as discussed above. Furthermore, this alteration in N and P availability might be induced by the longterm dominance of G. dewevrei itself, with slow-decomposing leaf litter generated by the dominant G. dewevrei (i.e., low SLA, high LDMC, high C:N) reinforcing low nutrient turnover rates and low N and P", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF10": {"text": "The environmental filtering encountered in the monodominant forest can also affect the subordinate species composition, namely by altering the probabilities of specific traits. For example,Peh et al. (2014) showed that species with low light requirement and high WD have a greater chance of establishing in the monodominant forest, where light levels are low under the dense canopy. Within our study area, this could not be confirmed with the WD of species uniquely found in the mixed forest being similar to those that did occur in the monodominant forest. However, overall community differences in traits-for the different species groups-have been found between the monodominant and the mixed forest, namely for nutrient contents, WUE traits, and SLA. The lower values of nutrient contents of all species within this monodominant tropical tree community could be a direct result of the altered N and P availability in this environment(Brookshire & Thomas, 2013;. Additionally, the species established in the monodominant forest show a lower mean SLA compared to the species in the mixed forest. These leaves with low SLA, high tissue density (see LDMC), and low nutrient concentrations (both N and P) generally have lower photosynthetic rates but a longer life span(Reich, Walters, Tjoelker, Vanderklein, & Bushena, 1998;Wright & Westoby, 2002). The longer leaf life span could provide advantages for species under the closed canopy of G. dewevrei, susceptible to the limited N availability, with an increased return of investment. Additionally, these leaf traits contribute to defend against herbivores and pathogens(Hanley, Lamont, Fairbanks, & Rafferty, 2007) and thus have higher survival rates", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF11": {"text": "did not establish in the monodominant forest. Species with a low WUE that keep their stomata open, thus reducing their stomatal resistance, could have a higher resource use efficiency for other limiting resources (e.g., light or nutrient limitations) enabling them to compete, or keep up, with the monodominant species. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis, because the isotopic compositions can only be used as proxies of WUE.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "None declared.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST"}]}
