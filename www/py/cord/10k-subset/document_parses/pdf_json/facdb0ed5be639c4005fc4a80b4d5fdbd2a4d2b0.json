Infants on mechanical ventilation (MV) fulfilling pARDS and sepsis criteria were prospectively recruited. For comparison, data from a historical cohort from 2015, with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, was retrospectively reviewed. The PFS bundle consisted of 1. maintenance of intravenous fluids (MIVF) at 50% of requirements; 2. drug volume reduction; 3. dynamic monitoring of preload markers to determine the need for fluid bolus administration; 4. early use of diuretics; and 5. early initiation of enteral feeds. The historical cohort treatment, the standard fluid strategy (SFS), were based on physician preferences. Peak fluid overload (PFO) was the primary outcome. PFO was defined as the highest FO during the first 72 h. FO was calculated as (cumulative fluid inputcumulative output)/kg*100. Fluid input/output were registered every 12 h for 72 h. Results: Thirty-seven patients were included in the PFS group (54% male, 6 mo (IQR 2,11)) and 39 with SFS (64%male, 3 mo (IQR1,7)). PFO was lower in PFS (6.31% [IQR4.4-10]) compared to SFS (12% [IQR8.4-15.8]). FO was lower in PFS compared to CFS as early as 12 h after admission [2.4(1.4,3.7) v/s 4.3(1.5,5.5), p < 0.01] and maintained during the study. These differences were due to less fluid input (MIVF and fluid boluses). There were no differences in the renal function test. PRBC requirements were lower during the first 24 h in the PFS (5%) compared to SFS (28%, p < 0.05). MV duration was 81 h (58,98) in PFS and 118 h (85154) in SFS(p < 0.05). PICU LOS in PFS was 5 (4, 7) and in SFS was 8 (6, 10) days. Conclusion: Implementation of a bundle to prevent FO in children on MV with pARDS and sepsis resulted in less PFO.

Restoration of circulating blood volume and perfusion to tissues is the primary end point of this therapy, decreasing mortality and morbidity of critically ill children with clinical signs of poor perfusion and shock [1] . Supported by guidelines and protocols, rapid administration of intravenous fluid is currently one of the most frequent interventions in critical care [2] [3] [4] [5] . Intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation may be lifesaving, but many studies have found that positive fluid balance is associated with negative outcomes in many clinical scenarios [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Critically ill patients are especially prone to positive fluid balance due to excessive fluid input (resuscitation fluids, maintenance intravenous fluid, continuous drug infusions, blood products and IV treatments), limited elimination of fluids (due to counterregulatory mechanisms such as antidiuretic hormone secretion) and due to capillary leakage in the interstitium, resulting in organ edema and dysfunction [16] [17] [18] [19] . Detrimental effects are very pronounced in organs with a high density of capillaries, such as the lung, due to capillary leakage associated with a high hydrostatic pressure [16, [19] [20] [21] . Fluid overload has been associated with pulmonary dysfunction, hypoxia, longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in children and adults on mechanical ventilation (MV) [6, 7, 13, 15, 20, [22] [23] [24] .

We developed this bundle based on preliminary data (29) that showed that excessive fluid administration during the first 72 h after admission was the main responsible factor for early fluid overload during the course of critical illness. Maintenance intravenous fluid calculation in current practices is based on the Holliday-Segar method, which was developed many decades ago. It is important to note that this method was supposed to estimate the 24 h water loss in hospitalized euvolemic children with normal renal function [32] . This method was not developed for use in critically ill infants, so it does not account for all the peculiarities of this group of patients. For example, febrile illness and tachypnea can increase insensible water loss. On the other hand, energy expenditure is lower in infants sedated and on MV and insensible water losses are very low in normothermic infants breathing humidified gas [32, 33] . Based on these data, we decreased MIVF to 50% of the calculated rate while maintaining the glucose infusion rates for infants to avoid hypoglycemia.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 130, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 131, "end": 134, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 135, "end": 138, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 139, "end": 142, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 143, "end": 147, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 148, "end": 152, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 153, "end": 157, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 158, "end": 162, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 163, "end": 167, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 168, "end": 172, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 173, "end": 177, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 178, "end": 182, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 183, "end": 187, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 342, "end": 346, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 817, "end": 821, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1214, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1218, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The second element of the bundle was fluid bolus administration. In addition to the clinical assessment of hypovolemia, we added to our bundle a dynamic preload parameter, pulse pressure variation, to decide on fluid administration. Resuscitation protocols and guidelines propose an aggressive fluid management approach as the first line treatment for sepsis and shock [1, 2] . The main objective of fluid bolus administration is to correct hypovolemia, a common initial finding in pediatric sepsis and shock [34] . Currently, fluid bolus administration is a frequent intervention in the emergency department and most of the patients receive between 20 and 60 mL\u00b7kg \u2212 1 before PICU admission [35] . The risks and unwanted effects of this approach have been highlighted in recent studies [36] [37] [38] . Adequate fluid resuscitation increases venous return, end diastolic and systolic volume and consequently stroke volume and cardiac index. Despite the widespread clinical use, data supporting fluid bolus therapy in hospitalized critically ill children is very weak [39] . Recent adult studies have emphasized that liberal use of fluid bolus is associated with a positive fluid balance, exposing patients to the risks associated with fluid overload [24] [25] [26] . We acknowledge that the functional hemodynamic markers of preload are not widely used in critically ill children. Most devices providing invasive arterial pressure monitoring can give at least pulse pressure variation parameters with the current technology. In our view, functional hemodynamic monitoring gives to the clinician an additional parameter to assess fluid status and predict fluid responsiveness, along with vital signs, physical examinations and biomarkers of dysoxia. Only 50% of critical ill children are fluid responders [40] , due to myocardial dysfunction and blunted adrenergic sensitivity [40, 41] . Additionally, it is important to recall that fluid hemodynamic response is short. It is estimated that 85% of crystalloid fluid boluses redistribute in the interstitial tissue four hours after administration or even less in critically ill patients having an increased capillary leak [5, 42] . In daily practice fluid boluses are the first response to multiple scenarios without a strong physiological support, i.e., tachycardia due to fever, respiratory distress or pain. With PFS, we were able to decrease fluid boluses, especially during the first 24 h, without any clinical evidence of detrimental hypovolemia or significant renal dysfunction. Urinary output was lower in PFS, and diuretic initiation was more frequent during the first 24 h after admission, but renal function tests where similar between groups. Limiting unnecessary fluid administration in the PFS group was also associated with less PRBC transfusions, probably as a result of a decreased hemodilution. Vasoactive drug support was lower in the PFS group. This may seem counterintuitive, but studies in adults have shown that hemodynamic instability is associated with liberal use of fluids [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 372, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 373, "end": 375, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 509, "end": 513, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 692, "end": 696, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 787, "end": 791, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 792, "end": 796, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 797, "end": 801, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1072, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1255, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1260, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1265, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1805, "end": 1809, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1881, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1885, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2171, "end": 2174, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2175, "end": 2178, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3049, "end": 3053, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3054, "end": 3058, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3059, "end": 3063, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3064, "end": 3068, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3069, "end": 3073, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The initiation of enteral feeds occurred earlier in the PFS group.

No specific data of the endpoints of resuscitation were registered, so it is difficult to extrapolate our protocol to unstable patients with ongoing signs of poor perfusion or dysoxia. Specifically, it is controversial what objective data the clinician must consider to terminate the resuscitation phase. All the patients included in this study suffered from sepsis due to acute pulmonary infectious diseases.
