Either way, a synthetic goal forces scientists to cross uncharted ground to encounter and solve problems that are not easily encountered through analysis. This drives the emergence of new paradigms in ways that analysis cannot easily do.

Here, the term was used to describe the synthesis of unnatural organic molecules that function in living systems. More broadly in this sense, the term has been used with reference to efforts to 'redesign life' [3] [4] [5] . This use of the term is an extension of the concept of 'biomimetic chemistry' , in which organic synthesis is used to create artificial molecules that recapitulate the behaviour of parts of biology, typically enzymes 6 . Synthetic biology has a broader scope, however, in that it attempts to recreate in unnatural chemical systems the emergent properties of living systems 7 , including inheritance, genetics and evolution [3] [4] [5] 8 . Synthetic biologists seek to assemble components that are not natural (therefore synthetic) to generate chemical systems that support Darwinian evolution (therefore biological). By carrying out the assembly in a synthetic way, these scientists hope to understand non-synthetic biology, that is, 'natural' biology. This motivation is similar in biomimetic chemistry, where synthetic enzyme models are important for understanding natural enzymes.",

With analysis, if the data contradict the theory, the data are (as often as not) discarded to protect the theory. If one does this when putting an orbiter around Mars, however, the orbiter crashes 89 . For this reason, synthesis drives the evolution of paradigms, however this elusive term is defined 90, 91 . This is well illustrated in chemistry, which has long had powerful synthetic tools. For example, the late Robert Woodward credited the discovery of the rules underlying the orbital symmetry of molecules, for which Roald Hoffmann and Kenichi Fukui won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981, to problems encountered during the synthesis of vitamin B12 \uf6aeREF. 92\uf6af. Because vitamin B12 is a large molecule with many sterogenic (chiral) centers, the synthesis of B12 was, for chemistry at that time, the equivalent of a 'man-on-the-moon' goal. Accomplishing this goal led not only to a synthetic route to a complex molecule, but more importantly to a greater understanding of chemical bonding; something that was not accessible by simply observing the structure of B12.

The combination of chemistry, biology and engineering is now at the point where the 'man-on-the-moon' goal is approachable: creating artificial Darwinian systems. One of the metrics of the success of synthetic biology will be how well the effort to assemble existing biological parts into machines, and how well the effort to create artificial systems that reproduce the emergent properties of living systems drives new discoveries and new theories. from partitioning into lipid phases, an event believed to be essential for molecules to enter cells passively. The phosphate-ribose backbone is also the recognition site for nucleases. This knowledge, and the fact that the Watson-Crick model proposed no particular role for the phosphates in molecular recognition, encouraged the inference that the backbone could be changed without affecting pairing rules. The effort to synthesize non-ionic backbones changed the established view of nucleic acid structure. Nearly 100 linkers were synthesized to replace the 2\u2032-deoxyribose sugar, starting with the first by the Pitha 25 and Benner 26 laboratories. Nearly all analogues that lacked the REPEATING CHARGE showed worse rule-based molecular recognition. Even with the most successful uncharged analogues (such as the polyamide-linked nucleic-acid analogues (PNA) created by Nielsen and his group 27 ) molecules longer than 15 or 20 building units generally failed to support rule-based duplex formation.

This complex then captures, through hybridization, a target probe, which in turn hybridizes to a pre-amplifier molecule, thereby 'sandwiching' the analyte between the capture probe and the pre-amplifier. The pre-amplifier captures a branched DNA dendrimer (amplifier) that contains several signalling molecules on each branch. As a consequence of the branching, a single analyte assembles a large number of signalling molecules in the microwell. These assays use the expanded genetic alphabet shown in FIG. 1 . When standard nucleotides were used to assemble the signalling nanostructure, significant noise was seen, because non-target DNA that was present in the biological sample was captured by the probes in the microwell even in the absence of analyte. Incorporating components of the artificial genetic alphabet in the dendrimer reduced the noise.

The strain was engineered by introducing genes for various steps in the pathway from two other microorganisms in addition to R. eutropha.",

These then dock to the Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains of adaptor proteins, which, in turn, activate signalling pathways that generate specific cellular responses. The signal created by these events depends on the details of the adaptor proteins. For example, the SH2 domain of the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) adaptor is flanked by two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. These bind proteins, such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor son of sevenless homolog 2 (SOS2) and GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1) docking protein, which then help to activate the Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathways, respectively. GRB2 therefore couples the phosphorylated motifs to signalling pathways that lead to cell survival, growth and proliferation. Different combinations lead to the opposite outcome. For example, autophosphorylated death receptors bind adaptors, such as fas (TNFRSF6)associated via death domain (FADD); this is followed by an analogous signalling process that promotes cell death through apoptosis.",

Here, the synthetic goal confirmed the power (and, to some extent, the underlying correctness) of a modular model of regulation by this system.

All enzymes from Ralstonia eutropha are shown in black, whereas those from Areomonas caviae and Streptomyces cinnamonensis are shown in green and red, respectively. Modified, with permission, from REF. 76 \u00a9 American Chemical Society (2002). b | The combination of enzymes from three sources in an Escherichia coli host generated a strain of the bacterium that produced a precursor for artemisinin, an antimalarial drug. The challenge of this experiment lay in the need to curtail the pathway to recognize and avoid metabolite toxicity, while optimizing the yield of the desired product. The general methodology for the pathway design was to use an engineered mevalonate pathway that is absent in E. coli, rather than the DXP (1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate) pathway that is native to the organism. The synthetic operons used are depicted, and the engineered pathway metabolites are shown in red. In the engineered mevalonate pathway, the fan of genes from ERG12 to ispA exist on multiple plasmids to tune the pathway for optimization of the product while avoiding metabolite toxicity. As depicted at the bottom of the figure, the E. coli strain DYM1, a strain deficient in isoprenoid synthesis, was used, because the DXP pathway was found to limit product yield, probably owing to an unrecognized link between the pathway and physiological control elements in the organism. Enzymes used (isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae unless otherwise noted): ADS, amorphadiene synthase; atoB, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (E. coli); dxs, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; ERG12, mevalonate kinase; ERG8, phosphomevalonate kinase; HMGS, HMG-CoA synthase; idi, IPP isomerase (E. Synthetic biological 'toys' can also be created. For example, an artificial oscillatory network (a 'repressilator') was constructed in E. coli by Elowitz and Leibler 16 (FIG. 5) These synthetic biologists placed into an E. coli host three transcriptional repressor systems that are not together part of any natural biological system, and coupled these to the synthesis of green fluorescent protein. The fluorescent output of the cell oscillated as a function of time, providing a visual signal of the state of the oscillator in the cell. The oscillation period of hours was longer than the time typical to complete a cycle of cell division. This indicates that the state of the oscillator was transmitted from generation to generation, and became a property of a colony of cells.",

Extinctions are one consequence of this, occurring when the environmental challenges change too fast for Darwinian processes to keep pace. This is seen, for example, with natural life. The Ebola virus would spread more rapidly if it became airborne and less virulent, as would anthrax bacteria that were transmissible from an infected human host to an uninfected human.

This activity is autoinhibited, however, by means of two modules from N-WASP, a highly basic (B) motif and a guanosine 5'-triphosphatase (GTPase)-binding domain (GBD). These bind to two activating inputs, the phosphoinositide Pip2 and the activated GTPase Cdc42, where the respective binding disrupts autoinhibition. Because the two activating inputs function cooperatively, N-WASP behaves as an ' AND' gate; the output is positive (actin is polymerized) only if both Pip2 and Cdc42 inputs are present. Lim and co-workers then attempted to reprogram the input control of N-WASP. They tethered an unrelated modular domain-ligand pair (a PDZ domain and its cognate C-terminal peptide ligand) to the end of the N-WASP output domain (see part b of figure). They expected this to create an unnatural autoinhibitory interaction that could be relieved by the competitive binding of an external PDZ ligand. Under basal conditions, this synthetic switch was not activating. The unnatural autoinhibitory interaction was then removed by adding the PDZ ligand. The maximal activity was close to that of the isolated output domain. The result was the same switch, but one that was turned on by a different activator.",
