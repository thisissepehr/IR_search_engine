This study offers an examination of the role of local media in response to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in beef-producing communities in rural Alberta. BSE is one of several global risk issues that reflexive modernization theorists argue have the potential to trigger a transformation toward a critically reflexive society in which such risks are minimized. Content analysis of newspapers in beef-producing regions in Alberta, however, shows how local operators, whose pastures and feedlots are far from the purview of would-be monitors. As a result, reflexivity will require that beef producers and processors perceive BSE risk reduction as a priority. Reflexive modernization theory attributes the potential for mobilization to civil society in rather undifferentiated terms; however, certain social groups may be the key to the realization of reflexive modernization, and thus we need to pay closer attention to the discursive fields within which these groups engage.",

Within days several ranches in the regions covered in this study were quarantined, and the United States closed its border to Canadian beef, followed by several other countries, bringing the Canadian beef sector to a standstill. Two months later, the federal agricultural minister attempted to reinstill consumer confidence by requiring the removal of ''specified risk materials'' from cattle older than 30 months, about the time that disaster relief began to flow from state coffers into the hands of producers and processors. Criticism of the limited disease testing protocols required by the federal government emerged in ensuing years, however, with the Canadian Cattlemen's Association at one point contemplating a voluntary cull of 1.76 million cattle. More recently, the federal government announced the number of animals to be tested-already considered insufficient by some ranchers-would be further reduced by half (Markusoff 2008) . As the third largest beef producer in the world, these events were followed closely, particularly the Province of Alberta, which dominates Canada's beef economy.",

While other media are certainly relevant, rural print media is characterized by a high level of local readership, and tends to go into greater depth than television news, allowing for more detailed content analysis than other media sources.

Contemporary risks are unique in their human origin, derived from science and technology and the political choices that support those practices (Harrington 2005:286) . They are also associated with multiple social processes simultaneously, including human health and economic growth (Boin and 't Hart 2003) . And they are discursively produced, in that the generation and attenuation of risks lie in the endorsement and administration of technologies (Harrington 2005:286) and worldviews (Davidson and MacKendrick 2004) . Ultimately, as the negative consequences become increasingly difficult to ignore, modern risks have the potential to engender critical reflection of those institutions and practices that have come to dominate advanced industrial societies. According to Bourdieu (1990:108) , in times of crisis, the habitus-behaviors, sentiments, competences, and ways of understanding and reasoning (Crossley 2005 )-becomes dislocated from the way the lives of individuals are structured: ''The world loses its natural feel and at least some of what might have passed without question in the past is subject to argument and debate'' (Crossley 2005:69) .",

In reality, one might anticipate that in only a small minority of instances will a sufficient number of civil society actors in multiple locations respond to modern risks as anticipated by reflexive modernization proponents. Reflexive modernization demands first and foremost discursive attention to the nature of crisis-its causes, avenues for amelioration, and at a deeper level, whether the risk issue is in fact a ''crisis.'' Given that social understandings of both risk and safety are constructed and evolve through discursive negotiation, several agents may serve to facilitate or hinder the potential for reflexive modernization simply by influencing this discursive process, described by Beck (1995 Beck ( , 1997 as the ''relations of definition.'' This is particularly the case for invisible risks, such as BSE, that can only be made ''visible'' when socially defined. In these instances, the role of the mass media is central to definitional struggles regarding crisis (Cottle 1998; Short 1984) . While media actors do not directly control public discourse, their accounts have long been recognized as a primary source of raw material for such discourse (Gans 1979; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet 1944; Tuchman 1978) . ''News stories not only lend occurrences their existence as public events, but also impart character to them, for news reports help to shape the public definition of happenings by selectively attributing to them specific details or 'particulars''' (Tuchman 1978:190) .",

As the central filter through which risk discourse flows, mass media plays a crucial role in ''processes of risk revelation, the social contestation that surrounds scientific knowledge of risks, and also processes of social challenge to 'risk society''' (Cottle 1998:5-6) . Mass media comes to serve not only as the modern-day town crier (Park, Burgess, and McKenzie 1967) , but the guard in the watchtower as well. As such, it represents an ''amplification station,'' which serves to amplify or attenuate public reactions to risk by filtering and decoding risk event signals, and attaching social values to such information (Kasperson et al. 1988 ).",

Strategies to maximize readership, furthermore, may be interpreted differently by different media institutions, as expectations regarding professionalism, resources, and audience characteristics can all vary. While one media agent may attempt to maximize readership with stories designed to shock and awe, another may do so by selecting content designed to reassure.

According to Dornbusch (1998) , the British media shaped BSE perception by serving as both ''information disseminator'' and ''risk assessor.'' The British BSE issue was defined in expert and policy discourse as an animal health problem (Miller 1999) , but despite the various attempts by key actors to control the media, the British mass media was able to preserve a certain degree of freedom and redefined BSE in terms of food safety (Bauer et al. 2007 ). News stories evolved over time, reframing BSE from a health crisis into a story of national identity (Brookes 1999) . Media actors emphasized the conflicting scientific theories used to explain the BSE-vCJD link, and encouraged readers to question expert discourses, contributing to the disintegration of public trust in science (Mythen 2004) . Mass media also highlighted policy failures, extending public skepticism (Miller 1999) . Ultimately, the media were blamed for a drop in meat consumption in Britain of 40 percent from pre-BSE levels by 1996 (Linsky 1986; Miller 1999) .",

The role of the print media in rural communities is also unique, for a very different set of reasons. The relationship between media institution and audience for a rural news agent differs markedly from the U.K. context, or from virtually any urban regional context, for that matter. First, because the journalist faces a comparatively homogenous audience characterized by distinct boundaries between local and nonlocal entities (Hindman 1996) , the motive of the journalist is not necessarily to attract new readers, but rather to maintain the support of the current readership by avoiding offense toward the local cultural milieu. On the other hand, the audience itself could be seen as ''captive'' in certain respects, suggesting a relationship of mutual reinforcement between media and readership. Local newspapers might well be considered an important symbol of local community identity, toward which community members turn out of loyalty to their community, rather than strictly out of preference among multiple choices of media outlet.",

            "text": "It would appear far more likely that the local newspaper serving a rural community would tend toward the latter role. Given the incentive to resonate with the predilections of a relatively homogenous readership, rural journalists may be far more disposed to select content and frame news stories in a manner that is designed to maintain stability and build consensus (Kim et al. 2002) . Rural news agents are less likely to challenge their readers by introducing uncertainty, or disrupting the local power structure for fear of potential sanction (Donohue, Olien, and Tichenor 1989; Donohue, Tichenor, and Olien 1995) . The fact that local journalists are themselves members of local communities, and thus identify on a personal level with local culture serves as further reinforcement. According to Crawley (2007:320) ''in these situations, journalists often face one dominant, preferred meaning shared by both the community power structure and its media organizations.'' One means of forecasting whether a local newspaper might facilitate or hinder prospects for reflexive modernization among its rural readership might be the extent to which a given risk issue can be interpreted as threatening to local cultural identity. For some risk issues, the relationship between risk and identity is not clear-cut. In a study of local coverage of biotechnology in two agricultural regions, Crawley (2007) found local (although urban) papers were more complex and expressive of a wider diversity of views than national papers. Such a diversity of views has been similarly identified within the agricultural sector itself, as has been the case in regard to genetically modified wheat in Canada (Magnan 2007 ). This finding may reflect a lack of consensus among farmers regarding biotechnology, with some agricultural producers readily adopting biotechnology, and others expressing greater caution. BSE, on the other hand, could be seen as a clear and direct threat to farming identity, against which agricultural producers might well react in unison. Farmers see themselves as playing a fundamental role in society by providing an essential human need-food. To be faced with the possibility that what is being produced is not an essential human need but rather a serious health threat would be a hard pill to swallow indeed, and liable to be acknowledged only with the greatest hesitancy. The high likelihood for such cultural consensus describes the latter of two communicative amplification stations mentioned above-informal personal networks-which ''provide reference points for validating perceptions but are also likely to share a more general cultural view or bias'' (Kasperson et al. 1988:185) .",

Newspapers from Barrhead County include the locally owned Barrhead Leader and a supplemental weekly produced by the same news organization, Town and Country, which is also distributed to several other rural communities in Alberta. The third is from Peace MD, the Peace River Gazette, run by a parent media corporation, Sun Media. Although stories about BSE occurred far more frequently in the Barrhead papers, the results for each region in terms of content are strikingly similar, so we treat this as a single case study representing beef-producing regions in Alberta. A total of 400 articles on BSE were identified, from which we selected for further analysis a representative sample of 35 percent from the first six-month period (May-October 2003) , and 20 percent of the remaining time period. The final sample consisted of 10 articles from the Peace River Record Gazette; 17 from the Barrhead Leader; and 73 from Town and Country, for a total of 100 articles (the latter paper being a larger paper and the source of the majority of news on BSE). Of these, eight were editorial or opinion articles, and the remainder were news articles. Articles were categorized according to: (1) definition of crisis; (2) experts cited; (3) expressions of local cohesion/ division; (4) attribution of blame; (5) risk acceptance/denial; and (6) prescriptions for response. A reader interreliability test among the two primary researchers produced a 99 percent result.",

Explicit encouragement of beef consumption was prevalent after the initial outbreak, including several photographs of prominent people eating beef, community barbeques, or other symbols promoting beef consumption. The news organizations themselves took an active role in this campaign, in one instance featuring a special edition entitled ''Back the Beef'' (TC January 27, 2004 This persistent expression of confidence in the safety of Canadian beef not surprisingly coincides with a distinct lack of acceptance of BSE as a source of risk. Only four out of 100 articles questioned the safety of the food system, two of which were in opinion sections or letters to the editor. We identified just seven articles indicating some degree of normalization or acceptance of risk, stating for example that ''BSE will continue to plague the world'' (TC June 9, 2003:8), or ''we've always known that no beef-producing country is completely immune from the risk of BSE'' (RG June 3, 2003:4). The vast majority, on the other hand, instead referred to the outbreak as ''an isolated case'' (TC May 26, 2003:23) , with some articles employing the authority of science as support: ''This isn't an epidemic, and we have the results of testing released Sunday for proof. We're talking about one sick cow'' (BL May 27, 2003:A8, opinion). A week later, another newspaper reported: ''[the sick cow] was detected and BSE was the diagnosis. Our system works, and the cow in question did not enter the food chain. We should be grateful for that'' (TC June 2, 2003:8). Interestingly, this ''isolated incident'' framing persisted throughout the time frame of our sample, during which six subsequent Canadian-born cases of BSE emerged: ''Appearances of a few additional cases of BSE are inevitable . . . due to the dramatic scale of CFIA's active surveillance program'' (BL January 24, 2006:3, quoting federal veterinarian).",

At the beginning of the twenty-first century in Western Canada, the agricultural sector was reeling from drought, grasshopper infestations, and crop diseases, all of which occurred simultaneously along with unassociated but equally salient events, such as West Nile virus, SARS, and the Iraq/Afghanistan wars. According to Lewis and Tyshenko (2009:714) : ''The attenuated reaction in Canada towards mad cow disease and increased human health risks from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was due to the social context at the time.'' Observers might also attribute the lack of attention to BSE to the scale of the event: the BSE outbreak in Canada had not been associated with any cases of vCJD, and in comparison with Britain's outbreak, which topped 184,000 BSE cases, only 12 were reported in Canada as of January 2008.",

What is perhaps most remarkable about the BSE stories in these local media outlets, particularly given the extensive coverage, is the information not covered. Information regarding human health risk was largely absent. Even claims regarding the safety of Canadian beef were less predominant than economic concerns after the first month of coverage, despite the fact that, at the time of the first reported case in Alberta, 129 Britons had died of vCJD.

Those in the beef industry might question, for starters, the lackadaisical response of provincial and federal governments in Canada to the British BSE outbreak years earlier. After the first reported case in Alberta, then-Minister of Alberta's Agriculture, Food and Rural Development proposed that Alberta work with Ottawa to meet a national goal of testing 65,000 head of cattle every year. As of 2007, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (2008) had not reached this goal, having tested just over 58,000 cattle. Given that, at the time of the outbreak, over 2 million cattle were slaughtered in Canada annually, even the not-yet-attained goal of 65,000 tests represents a testing rate of .03 (Japan, by contrast, admittedly with a much smaller beef industry, tests every slaughtered head of cattle). Finally one might be justified in asking just how the industry came to adopt the practice of serving parts of cattle (and other animals) to cattle, but such deeper questioning of current production practices is also absent.",

If reflexive modernization were to occur, the dominant discourse would necessarily be about how to prevent additional cases of BSE, and further, how to recreate a food production system that is safe for humans, animals, and environment. The absence of such discussions in the local newspapers of these rural, beef-producing regions is not sufficient to conclude that no such reflexivity is present in the beef industry in Canada, or even in beef-producing communities in Alberta. But it does serve as a key indicator of constraint. Local newspapers in places like Barrhead and Peace River enjoy a prominent position in those discursive fields in which beef producers and their families and friends are located, and the likelihood is slim for reflexive transformation of agriculture without the engagement of these crucial actors. Of course, many reflexive modernizationists point to emerging information technologies, such as the World Wide Web, as primary sites for the fostering of ''subpolitics'' (Bentivegna 2006) , which may call into question the continued relevance of the print media as a dominant discursive venue. While digital communications technologies certainly give voice to many corners of civil society, two counter-points are worthy of mention here. First, the blogs, chat rooms, and related communication outlets tend to cater to the expression of particular views, and attract readers who must actively seek such content. Regional print media, by contrast continues to enjoy a ''captive audience'' of sorts, and access to this communication outlet tends to be reserved for the privileged (van Dijk 1993), all of which amounts to a dominant place in political discourse. Second, while internet use in rural communities is growing, it remains well below rates exhibited in urban regions-according to the 2006 Census 58 percent of rural residents in Canada accessed the World Wide Web, compared with over 70 percent of urban Canadians (Statistics Canada 2006)-and consequently the dominant position enjoyed by print media is only further elevated in these domains. The media framing of BSE is also unlikely to be explained by corporate influence over media outlets, given that beef producers in the two regions examined are predominantly independent family operators, rather than corporations. Having said this, the large economic role played by beef in Alberta was quite possibly a factor in the resistance of local media to a more critical discourse. Canada is the third largest beef producer in the world, and nearly half of the national herd of 13.5 million is located in Alberta. Estimates of the cost of the export quarantines on Canadian beef have been pegged at approximately $2.5 billion for 2003 (Mitura and Di Pietro 2004) . The very advantage of large-scale intensive livestock operations is of course cost efficiency, so consideration of alternative models would certainly have economic implications. Testing of cattle for BSE, which must be conducted after slaughter, implies a significant commitment of public revenues. On the other hand, rigorous testing as well as alternative agricultural models are used elsewhere across the globe, suggesting the economic viability of doing so.",

While one should not overstate the degree of ideological consensus in rural communities, by all accounts Peace River and Barrhead are relatively stable, homogenous communities steeped in Alberta's ranching history. Both communities were settled around the turn of the twentieth century as agricultural communities, and despite the rapid capitalization of agriculture since that time, in many respects little has changed. As is typical of many rural agricultural communities in Canada, according to the 2006 Census, 76 percent of residents in both Peace MD and in Barrhead County lived at the same address five years prior (the equivalent Provincial figure is 52 percent). The local populations of both regions are completely devoid of people of color, have lower percentages of residents with university degrees, and higher percentages of married couples, than the Province as a whole. More to the point, even if there does exist a degree of local contention regarding the need for reflexive changes in the beef industry, the lack of representation of such alternative views in local print media would very likely have aided in the marginalization of those views. That said, researchers should not presume that community responses to agricultural risks to be uniform, but rather contingent on particular cultural and historical contexts. Indeed, one recent study of intensive hog farming operations highlighted the heated community-level conflicts that such operations can generate (Novek 2003) . Unlike cattle ranching in Alberta, which enjoys a lengthy history and cultural niche, intensive hog farms are a recent incursion in many communities, and this may well contribute to the differences in response.",

Media actors who serve smaller, relatively homogenous readerships are likely to be influenced by the anticipated degree to which a particular frame will resonate with local readers. Because readers are resistant to discursive framing that conflicts with preexisting beliefs (Tewksbury et al. 2000) , the failure to provide news that resonates with such an audience can threaten the small market upon which such papers depend, or at least the job security of individual journalists. This is by no means a one-way process, however. Rural communities also appear to express a much greater loyalty to their local newspaper, possibly as a symbol of community identity. The Barrhead Leader/Town and Country has a weekly circulation of 3,919 (ComBase 2005), in a County with a total of 2,090 households as of the 2006 Census. Similarly, the Peace River Gazette has a weekly circulation of 2,638 (ComBase 2005), serving just 515 households in the Peace MD. By contrast, the Edmonton Journal, which serves the Edmonton metropolitan area with over 405,000 households, has a seven-day weekly average circulation of just 145,000 (Edmonton Journal n.d.), with many of these being delivered outside the Edmonton region. Further research on newsprint readership in Alberta found 77 percent of an interview sample of 10,000 indicating they read the last issue of their local community paper, whereas only 40 percent indicated they read either of the Province's urban dailies or national daily papers (ComBase 2006) .",

While this case study is by no means conclusive, it raises the question as to whether media framing of regional BSE events played a part.

Different social agents will have lesser or greater degrees of power to instigate change. These differences are not necessarily defined solely by the traditional political and economic matrices of power in Western society, but also in terms of location in relation to the risk in question.
