The reliability of such models depends upon elucidation of key epidemiologic parameters for the disease, as well as a strong understanding of the transmission dynamics in susceptible populations and the effect of intervention strategies on preventing disease spread 3 . A variety of models have been developed in recent years to identify critical targets for control efforts, predict impacts, and estimate resource requirements for specific outbreak scenarios for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) 4 . However, it is critical that mathematical models applied to predict disease spread and impact are built upon parameters that are reliable and representative for the specific host-pathogen combination 2 . In addition, models used to inform disease control planning efforts need to be able to adequately represent the complexity of the livestock production systems involved and the often inter-linked and overlapping disease control strategies likely to be deployed. Similarly, thorough understanding of the biological relevance of modeled parameters is needed for appropriate interpretation of the modeled output 5,6 . With increasing emphasis on applying disease control measures in a manner that minimizes the impact and disruption to non-affected industries, models used to inform national strategies for FMD control must often address complex aspects of farm structure, demography, and animal movements, as well as surveillance, quarantine, and depopulation strategies 7,8 .

The proportion of transmission that occurs during the incubation phase is commonly denoted by theta (\u03b8) 11, 12 . A low value of \u03b8 indicates correspondingly low extent of transmission prior to observation of clinical disease. Although a low \u03b8 is relatively uncommon, this has been associated with infectious diseases for which control or eradication programs have been highly successful such as smallpox and rinderpest 11, 13 . At the other end of the spectrum are diseases for which \u03b8 is remarkably high, such as HIV/AIDS, which are notoriously difficult to control 11 . Closely related to the concept of \u03b8 is the temporal disparity between incubation and latency which represents the period of infectiousness included within the incubation period, defined herein as \u03c9 (omega; Fig. 1 ). While \u03b8 is intrinsically linked to the total length of the infectious period (often difficult to measure), \u03c9 can be estimated without having knowledge of the termination of infectiousness. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of a pathogen is frequently cited to project and characterize an infectious disease epidemic. This quantity is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical primary case during its entire period of infectiousness, in a completely susceptible population and in the absence of control measures 14, 15 .

In order to explore the concept of disease spread before clinical detection, it was of particular interest to estimate the latent period (time from infection until onset of infectiousness) in relation to the incubation period (time from infection until appearance of clinical signs of disease). The estimated parameters were subsequently used to explore the impact of alterations in the duration of subclinical infectiousness on simulated FMD outbreaks in commercial swine production systems under both optimal and suboptimal response conditions. Disease modeling is critically dependent upon input parameters that closely reflect the intrinsic properties of the infectious agent as well as externally variable features of the modeled scenario (e.g. population composition and density, contact networks and patterns, topographical characteristics, meteorological variations and availability of resources) 2, 23 . The simulations in this current investigation utilized the national FMD model developed by the US Department of Agriculture to simulate FMD outbreaks within the US pig production system.

Onset of viremia was also correlated with infectiousness, which is likely due to the role of viremia in causing systemic dissemination and shedding of virus. As demonstrated in this investigation, inappropriate use of proxy measures to define the onset of infectiousness in replacement of actual transmission data can lead to drastic misinterpretations of the transmission potential of infected animals. These misinterpretations may in turn affect FMD outbreak simulations, resulting in underestimation of outbreak size and severity, leading to unrealistic estimates of resource needs and misguided guidance on the appropriate application of control interventions. Specifically, underestimating the potential for disease transmission during the incubation phase may lead to wider dissemination of the outbreak than anticipated, and subsequent failure of reactive control interventions such as vaccination. Contrastingly, overestimating disease transmission can promote excessively aggressive countermeasures and lead to destruction of large numbers of healthy animals and associated economic losses.

However, one published work contradicts these findings by suggesting that FMD is unlikely to be transmitted before the onset of clinical disease 12 . Although there is limited published information on this subject, the consensus of available data suggests that subclinical transmission of FMD does occur, indicating that incubation is longer than latency and the resultant \u03c9 is greater than zero. This result was concluded based on the significant disparity between the durations of incubation and latency which indicated a distinct period of subclinical infectiousness that was demonstrated by experimentation and verified by modeling. Due to the limited group sizes and ubiquitous infection in groups to which transmission occurred, it was not possible to estimate R 0 in the current investigation. However, previous investigations have estimated the basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , for FMDV within groups of non-vaccinated pigs in experimental settings to be as high as 30.74 (95% CI: 11.09-85.17) 21 or 40 (95% CI: 21-74) 27 .

As R 0 and \u03b8 increase, control interventions must be highly effective, and multiple interventions are required in order bring the outbreak under control. Estimated values of R 0 and \u03b8 for FMDV suggest that control of epidemics is dependent on using multiple, highly effective control interventions. Interestingly, these results may also suggest that isolation and contact tracing, if conducted nearly perfectly, could eventually be sufficient to prevent epidemic propagation.

The objective of the FMD outbreak simulations described herein was to evaluate the effect of altering the duration of the subclinical infectious period (omega; \u03c9) on spread and duration of an outbreak of FMD in a US pig production sector. Estimates of disease stage durations were derived from modeling of animal-level infection dynamics ( Table 1 ). The originally modeled output consisted of estimates for the durations of latent (E), incubation (C) and infectious (I) periods. The durations of the subclinical infectious period (\u03c9 = C \u2212 E) and clinical infectious period (I C = I \u2212 C) were derived from these outputs. In addition to the baseline scenario (\u03c9 = 1 day), five omega values (0 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 5 days) were subjectively selected to evaluate the effect on altering the duration of the subclinical infectious period on the spread and duration of simulated outbreaks. While choosing different omega values, the durations of latent and clinical infectious periods were kept constant (similar to baseline scenario) except for the scenario in which \u03c9 = 0 day of omega where the latent duration was set to 2 days (Supplementary Table S4 ). The Within-herd (WH) software version 0.9.7 available through the North American Animal Disease Spread Model 35 was used to estimate herd-level parameters based on the modeled animal-level FMD disease stage durations. A spatial microsimulation model called the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS) was used to generate a synthetic population file of 45,509 farms with 54,628,373 total pigs 36 representative of pig production systems in the eastern United States (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The US pig farms (with essential attributes for ISP such as identification number, herd size, type of farms, and Cartesian coordinates) located in the Great Lake, North East and South East regions were included in the model scenarios. About 72% (N = 45, 509) of the total pig farms in the United States are located in these regions. Amongst these farms, 31% were commercial farms with a median herd size of 2725 pigs (range: 100 to 60, 595) and 69% were small-scale enterprises with a median herd size of 6 pigs (range: 1 to 99). Farm-type specific movement parameters and contact rates were assigned to reflect differences in movements between commercial and small-scale enterprises.

FMD epidemics were initiated from single farms. After exposure to FMDV, the susceptible farms were modeled to transit into latent, subclinically infectious, clinically infectious, and depopulated states. The spread of FMDV from an infected to susceptible farms was modeled to occur through direct contact, indirect contact, and local spread (Supplementary Note). The daily probability of transmission of FMD virus from infected farms to susceptible farm was calculated as the hypergeometric probability of shipping at least one infected animal off of an infected farm given the average herd size, shipment size, and the number of infected animals in a herd on a given day ( Supplementary Fig. S3 , Supplementary Note). Once an infected farm was detected, several control strategies were imposed simultaneously as is typically performed in response to outbreaks in FMD-free areas. Control strategies included zoning of control areas, tracing of animal movements, animal movement restrictions, depopulation of the infected farms, and surveillances as delineated in the national response plan for FMD 24 (Supplementary Note). For each of the omega scenarios, two overall control strategies (optimal and suboptimal) were separately simulated. In the optimal control strategy, the detection of infected farms through passive surveillance was modeled to occur just after onset of clinical signs, which was further delayed by 14 days in suboptimal control category. Additionally, the delay in depopulation of detected farms was 3 (small farms) to 5 days (big farms) in the optimal control category, which was delayed by 7 more days to represent the suboptimal control.
