This is illustrated by five different observations. 1. In Peperomia kjellii, P. pachystachya, P. palmiriensis, P. paradoxa, P. phyllanthopsis, and P. reptilis, a 'vegetative' leaf is always present opposite to a 'fertile' branch, in a plant with otherwise alternate leaves (Fig. 1A) . The 'fertile' branch was the plant's terminal internode before a sympodial shoot developed. 2. In P. kjellii, P. palmiriensis, P. phyllanthopsis, and P. reptilis, a serial axillary bud develops abaxially of the axillary bud, from which develops the sympodial shoot that ensures a growth in length of the plant. In a later stage, a bract, being the outer part of the serial axillary bud, may be seen in the axil between the sympodial shoot and the petiole. Because the bract is positioned at the side of the petiole and opposite to the side of the 'fertile' branch, it clearly indicates which of the opposed structures is the petiole and which is the 'fertile' branch ( Fig. 1A) . In P. pachystachya and P. paradoxa, the bract's position is more lateral to the axillary bud and can hardly be used to make this distinction. 3. The petiolar and internodal ribs of P. reptilis clearly show the difference between the petiole and the 'fertile' branch. In this species, the petioles are characterized by three ribs: one at the abaxial side running down from the mid-nerve of the leaf blade and two lateral ones running down from the two lateral nerves of the leaf blade. The internodes of P. reptilis, by contrast, are characterized by two ribs running down from the lateral ribs of the Figure 1 .

(Illustration by Marc Reynders.) petiole and crossing the node. The occurrence of two ribs on the 'fertile' branch clearly proves that it is of stem nature. 4. Sometimes, a sessile leaf does not only 'subtend' an inflorescence, but also a complete leafy branch, indicating that the 'fertile' branch is just the basal internode of that branch. This has been observed in P. palmiriensis (holotype) (Fig. 2) and P. foliiflora (Allard 21574, NY; Mathias 5356, MO). 5.

'Vegetative' leaves are reduced and are present as a single bract opposed to their corresponding 'fertile' branch. Their opposite position may become less obvious when new 'fertile branches' develop from their axil. In the schematic presentation of Figure 1B , the 1\u2032-7\u2032 distance is elongated to elucidate the architecture. In reality, that area has a more condensed aspect. One or more normal 'vegetative' leaves may develop before the development of the first 'fertile' branch. They are usually smaller than 'fertile' leaves and are less cordate. They may persist at the base of the cluster of 'fertile' branches. However, this is rarely observed, and most specimens seem to have only 'fertile' leaves. In some species, the main stem may bear one or a few 'vegetative' branches with a similar architecture, i.e. with a terminal cluster of 'fertile' branches. The 'fertile' leaves support a larger number (four to ten) of spadices than the species in the first group, and the spadices are more or less appressed.

In this paper, we call the inflorescence a 'spadix', because of its fleshy rachis, similar to the spadix in Araceae.

For this reason, we prefer to use the term 'spadix' for the whole genus and not exclusively for the species with a thickened rachis.

Each spadix is supported by a peduncle. The flowers and the drupes are sessile in most species and pedicellate in a few species. In other species, the flowers are sessile, but a so-called pseudopedicel develops as an outgrowth of the rachis when the drupe reaches maturity (Sastrapradja, 1968) .

Apart from our own collection (Mathieu 1228) , another Ecuadorian collection (\u00d8llgaard 98401) has been located amongst the unidentified specimens at AAU (duplicate at BR). In Ecuador, P. foliiflora has until now only been found in the southern province of Zamora-Chinchipe near the border with Peru, where it grows in wet montane forest on shallow clayish soil. In Peru, it is reported from the departments of Hu\u00e1nuco, Cajamarca, and Amazonas. Notes: 1. Peperomia foliiflora is described from Peru as one of the 24 first ever published species in Peperomia. The specific epithet refers to the inflorescences seeming to originate from the base of the sessile 'fertile' leaves. This distinguishing feature may easily be recognized on the splendid colour plate of the protologue. As this was very different from other Peperomia species known at that time, the taxon was placed in the new genus Phyllobryon (Miquel, 1843: 50) until the latter was reunited with Peperomia (de Candolle, 1869: 396). 2. At the time P. phyllantha Opiz was published (1828), Piper phyllanthus was an unpublished name figuring on the label of specimen 761 in the Willdenow herbarium (B). Being mentioned as a synonym in the protologue of P. phyllantha, it became a nomen nudum. The name obviously inspired Opiz to form the new Peperomia epithet, although Haenke s.n. (PR) served as the type instead of the Willdenow specimen. Some 40 years later, both Piper phyllanthus and P. phyllantha were mentioned as synonyms of P. foliiflora (de Candolle, 1869: 396). Later, it became evident that P. phyllantha needed to be distinguished from P. foliiflora, whereas Piper phyllanthus was indeed identical to P. foliiflora (Trelease, 1936: 47, 73) . For this reason, Piper phyllanthus is mentioned as a synonym here and not under P. phyllantha. 3. In both publications cited under Note 1, P. phyllantha is considered as a synonym of P. foliiflora. Trelease considered both as distinct species because of the glabrous leaves of P. foliiflora, by contrast with the presence of solitary trichomes in P. phyllantha (Trelease, 1936: 47, 73) . We follow Trelease in distinguishing the species, but for different reasons. Thorough examination of the types clearly shows that both taxa have the same kind of indumentum. Both species show condensed lateral 'fertile' branches. However, P. phyllantha shows one or more 'vegetative' lateral branches, by contrast with the simple main stem in P. foliiflora. The 'fertile' branches of P. phyllantha have the same length as the leaves, whereas, in P. foliiflora, the branches are considerably longer than the leaves. In addition, the leaves of P. phyllantha are distinctly elliptical, whereas those of P. foliiflora are ovate. The basal leaf lobes in P. phyllantha usually overlap, whereas these of P. foliiflora do not. Peperomia foliiflora exhibits ellipsoid 1 mm long drupes, whereas those of P. phyllantha are (sub)globose and shorter. The differences are sufficiently distinct to keep both taxa separated. 4. The leaves of Ecuadorian P. foliiflora specimens from the Cordillera del Condor are adaxially glabrous. We prefer not to consider this as a feature worth splitting them off as a distinct taxon, because only a limited number of solitary trichomes are also present in most Peruvian specimens. More Ecuadorian collections may illustrate whether there is indeed a real continuum concerning this feature. Anyway, the solitary trichomes abaxially at the end of the nerves are present in both the Ecuadorian and Peruvian specimens. 5. Lectotypification: Peperomia foliiflora Ruiz & Pav. The MA specimen, labelled and numbered '272' by Juan Jos\u00e9 Tafalla in 1795 and showing plenty of mounted material, is designated as the lectotype. In addition to the K specimen, which has a similar handwritten label, and the F specimen, which is clearly a fragment of the MA specimen, it is likely that the other mentioned Ruiz and Pav\u00f3n specimens in B, MA, and P belong to the same collection. This can, however, not be stated with absolute certainty as they lack any numerical reference. 6. Lectotypification: Phyllobryon pavonii Miq. Miquel mentioned both Peperomia foliiflora Ruiz & Pav. and Peperomia phyllantha Opiz as synonyms of Phyllobryon pavonii (Miquel, 1843: 50) . The Phyllobryon name is illegitimate, as the epithet should have been based on the oldest available Peperomia basionym. The MA specimen Ruiz & Pav\u00f3n 272, the lectotype of P. foliiflora, is designated herewith also as the lectotype of Phyllobryon pavonii. Miquel erroneously considered P. phyllantha as a synonym of Phyllobryon pavonii because Opiz used Piper phyllanthus (a P. foliiflora synonym) as the basionym 'name' for P. phyllantha. However, Opiz did not use the basionym 'type'. Haenke s.n. (PR), used as the type instead, is a distinct species. 7. Although the cilantro smell of crushed leaves is reported from several Peperomia species (P. acuminata, P. pseudovariegata, P. maculosa, etc.), it is very strong in P. foliiflora.

Of this collection, three sheets were originally stored at MA. One sheet, which became the holotype, was sent to US in 1932. The precise location at which this collection was made is unknown. The occurrence of the species is reported from the Central and Oriental Colombian Andes (departments of Caldas, Cundinamarca, and Huila) at 2500-2800 m altitude in a mountain cloud forest habitat (Callejas, 1997: 33) . However, the only collection cited in this publication is von Sneidern 2213, which is from Huila but belongs to a different species (see P. kjellii). Two other collections identified as P. phyllanthopsis have been found at NY. The first, from Caldas, belongs to this species, but the second, Luteyn 12614 from Valle, does not belong to the pseudo-epiphyllous Peperomia species. Notes: 1. In the protologue, the leaves were described as 'alternate, or uppermost opposite'. This opposite leaf position is a misinterpretation of some branches as petioles. Indeed, 'fertile' branches are of the same size as the petiole of the opposite 'vegetative' leaf, resulting in apparently opposite (thus pseudoopposite) leaves. Where two leaves seem to be opposite, only one of them is a 'vegetative' leaf, whereas the other is a sessile leaf on top of a short branch. There is a distinct difference between the petiole and the 'fertile' branch where they originate from the main stem. The petiole 'clasps' the node to some extent, the lateral margins of the petiole crossing the node and continuing downwards into two internodal ribs. This is not the case with the 'fertile' branch. The location of a small bract, part of a serial axillary bud, also indicates which of the two opposed structures is the branch and which is the petiole. The bract is located at the side of the petiole and opposed to the side of the branch. The pseudo-opposite position of two 'fertile' leaves, as depicted on the splendid colour plate of this plant made by Pedro Alvincula de Almanza during the Mutis expedition (Iconografia Mutisiana plate nr. 695 -MA), does not occur in P. phyllanthopsis and is an idealization of the artist not familiar with the particular branch-petiole issue in this taxon (Fig. 8) . Although alternate leaves do not occur on the published reproduction, the accompanying description states, 'alternas en los tallos decumbentes, pseudo-oppuestas en los tallos erectos' (Callejas, 1997: 33) , which is obviously based on Trelease's protologue. 2. This species is morphologically most close to P. palmiriensis (see Note 2 in the discussion of that species). As mentioned already when discussing P. palmiriensis (Note 3), the pilose lower leaf surface of that taxon, one of the criteria distinguishing it from P. phyllantopsis, has been proven to be an artefact.

Peperomia pseudophyllantha seems morphologically close to P. phyllantha Opiz, but differs from the latter in being a more robust plant, and in having leaves with a glabrous adaxial surface and an ellipsoid drupe. The larger leaf size with a more undulate margin may also help in distinguishing this species from P. phyllantha.2. Peperomia pseudophyllantha also shows some resemblance to P. magnifoliiflora G.Mathieu (see Note 2 in the discussion of that taxon). 3. The holotype shows a 'vegetative' leaf seeming to originate from the main stem. This is a mounting artefact. It should have been mounted at the base of the cluster of branches at the top of the stem.
