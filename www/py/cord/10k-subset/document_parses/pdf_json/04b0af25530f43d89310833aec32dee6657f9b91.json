To identify molecular signatures of sALS we performed genome-wide expression profiling in laser capture microdissection-enriched surviving motor neurons (MNs) from lumbar spinal cords of sALS patients with rostral onset and caudal progression. After correcting for immunological background, we discover a highly specific gene expression signature for sALS that is associated with phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) pathology. Transcriptome-pathology correlation identified casein kinase 1\u03b5 (CSNK1E) mRNA as tightly correlated to levels of pTDP-43 in sALS patients. Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation in human sALS patientand healthy control-derived frontal cortex, revealed that TDP-43 binds directly to and regulates the expression of CSNK1E mRNA. Additionally, we were able to show that pTDP-43 itself binds RNA. CK1E, the protein product of CSNK1E, in turn interacts with TDP-43 and promotes cytoplasmic accumulation of pTDP-43 in human stem-cell-derived MNs. Pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation is therefore, reciprocally regulated by CK1E activity and TDP-43 RNA binding.

While about ten percent occur in a Mendelian pattern of inheritance (familial ALS, fALS), the majority of ALS cases (90%) are sporadic (sALS) with no known genetic cause. The etiology of sALS and the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration remain elusive [47] . At present, there is no cure for ALS, a dearth of effective therapeutic targets, and no broadly used molecular biomarkers to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, there are currently no available animal models for experimentation in the pathophysiology of sALS. However, several lines of evidence implicate a central role for perturbed RNA homeostasis in both fALS and sALS [29] . (1) Neuronal inclusions containing hyperphosphorylated Trans-Activation Response DNA Binding Protein 43kd (TDP-43) are the most common neuropathological hallmark present in both sporadic and familial ALS [4, 35] . TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) responsible for multiple RNA-processing functions including regulation of RNA stability, splicing, and translation [27, 37] . (2) A significant number of fALS causing mutations occur in genes encoding RBPs including TARDBP (TDP-43), FUS (TLS), TAF15, HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPA1 and EWSR1 [42] . (3) The most common genetic cause of ALS is the recently discovered hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene C9orf72 (C9ALS), where one of the main mechanisms may involve inhibition of RBPs by transcribed toxic RNA and patients exhibit widespread RNA processing alterations [38] . Together, these observations suggest that altered RBP localization and activity are conserved features of motor neuron disease in both fALS and sALS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 174, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 175, "end": 178, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 436, "end": 440, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 823, "end": 827, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1037, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1041, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1202, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1206, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1367, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1647, "end": 1651, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Electronic supplementary material"}, {"text": "Unbiased profiling of expression and RNA processing patterns can reveal disease mechanisms, clinically relevant biomarkers, and converging pathways that underlie heterogeneous phenotypes of the diverse groups of ALS. While the lack of animal models for the sporadic form of the disease has shifted the focus of research to monogenic models, an alternative strategy is to interrogate molecular changes occurring in human patient tissues [14] . Prior studies have primarily used two approaches to study postmortem ALS tissues: homogenized bulk tissue and cell type specificenriched tissues. Homogenized tissues fail to capture the complex heterogeneity of the nervous system in which mainly one neuronal population undergoes degeneration. Meanwhile, cell-enriched profiling selectively examines neuronal RNA pools by dissection [15] or laser capture microdissection (LCM) [12, 13, 22, 39] . Simultaneous profiling of LCM-captured MNs and the immediately surrounding anterior horn tissue have identified robust gene expression differences in the MN compartment that failed to be identified by analyses of the anterior horn, highlighting the lack of appropriate resolution in studies using homogenized bulk tissues [39] . A comprehensive systems-based gene-expression analysis of C9orf72 fALS [12] and a study correlating gene-expression with p62-pathology, a second neuropathological marker for sALS beside TDP-43, has been assessed to further explore disease mechanisms [13] .

The site of onset and distribution of involvement between UMNs and LMNs are key determinants of phenotype [41] since MNs in anatomical regions distant from the site of onset, while in the path of degradation, often appear to be relatively unaffected or in early stages of degeneration at the time of death [40] . For example, impaired neuronal control of respiratory muscles often occurs early in the clinical course of ALS while other somatic motor functions remain intact [45] , and conversely, patients kept alive by maintaining respiratory function on ventilators gradually progress to a locked-in state of total motor control loss [34] . Therefore, sALS is unique in that the degeneration of MNs innervating the respiratory muscles is the critical determinant of survival, whereas other neurodegenerative diseases patients exhibit respiratory distress in more advanced stages of neurodegeneration. Thus, while neuropathology of most degenerative diseases typically progresses uniformly to end-stage neuropathology, in ALS degeneration is dispersed three-dimensionally [40] and staging of ALS neuropathology is currently based on the anatomical distribution of pTDP-43 inclusions, not chronological progression [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 246, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 442, "end": 446, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 610, "end": 614, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 772, "end": 776, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1213, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1354, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Electronic supplementary material"}, {"text": "Consideration of the neuroanatomical progression of ALS can be exploited to carefully dissect and capture molecular signatures of susceptible but surviving neuronal populations [39] . Here we have isolated surviving MNs from the lumbar spinal region of sALS patients with rostral onset and caudal disease progression and relatively early respiratory failure by LCM and profiled gene expression by RNA-sequencing. We applied a stringent analytical approach to identify unique transcriptomic signatures predictive of sALS histopathology. Comparison of transcriptomic and histopathologic data revealed that mRNA expression levels of the kinase CSNK1E were highly correlated to phospho-TDP43 (pTDP-43) pathology. Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (eCLIP) [49] demonstrated that TDP-43 bound to the 3\u2032 UTR of CSNK1E RNA, which was upregulated in sALS, and loss of TDP-43 function in vitro led to altered CSNK1E mRNA levels. CK1E protein encoded by CSNK1E displays protein-protein interaction with TDP-43 and increased expression of CSNK1E resulted in an increase in TDP-43 phosphorylation. Thus, we exploited unique features of sALS neurodegeneration to elucidate interplay between gene expression changes, TDP-43 and its phosphorylation directly in affected sALS patient tissue.

CX3CR1 protein is the juxtacrine receptor for fractalkine localized on the plasma membrane of neurons and is believed to have a disease-modifying role in humans [30] and a protective role in the SOD1 G93A ALS mouse model [26] . We found significant upregulation of markers of adaptive immune cells such as CD4, CD22 and CXCR4 [Data S1a (Online Resource 2)], suggesting infiltration of peripheral immune cells such as T-lymphocytes.

Since PGRN is also extensively expressed in microglia and upregulated in sALS patients [36] , our observation of GRN mRNA levels could be a result of increased number of microglia surrounding MNs. Another possible reason for increased GRN levels could be altered regulation of its mRNA by TDP-43 [37] .

Using a set of 370 differentially expressed genes [Data S1d (Online Resource 2)] in a dataset adjusted for confounders as described above, we characterized sALS based on an individual gene expression signature. After filtering immune-related genes, lumbar MNs from rostral onset sALS patients fell into two groups based on individual patient gene expression profiles, and importantly, the group correlating better with control subjects was found to have a significantly lower pTDP-43 burden, consistent with the hypothesis that these MNs were in relatively early stages of degeneration.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Disease characterization based on gene expression signature"}, {"text": "Profiling MNs from human spinal cord in this manner is a direct approach to unraveling the complexity of human disease, but clearly drawbacks are that the samples are genetically more variable than animal models and iPSC-derived neuronal cultures. Therefore, we noted two exceptions: control nervous system (#44) clustered closely with the 'mild' gene expression disease group, and one sALS patient (#84) that showed low pTDP-43 burden was classified as 'severe'. Since aging was a significant GO term in our dataset, and control 44 is 80 years old (second oldest control individual in our cohort, Table 1 ), the clustering towards mild sALS might be due to an \"aging\" signature. Although sALS 84 did not cluster in the mild sALS group, it had higher correlation coefficients compared with the control samples than most of the other patients in the severe group. Clearly, greater sample numbers, stratification by UMN and LMN clinical disease burdens, better age-matched controls, and deeper sequencing in the future will explain such discrepancies that could be due to either false positives, aging, or genetic modifiers.

When we compared the datasets between our (pTDP43 vs. gene-expression) and the aforementioned report (p62 vs. gene-expression), there was an overlap of only two transcripts. This observation may be explained by the fact that in contrast to p62, TDP-43 is an RBP, directly contributing to RNA expression changes in ALS. In addition, there were differences in the spinal cord region that was analyzed. While the current study focuses largely on the lumbar spinal cord in sALS patients who had rostral onset and caudal disease spread, the Cooper-Knock et al. report evaluated cervical spinal cords of lumbar-onset patients with rostral spread.

Additionally, we showed that TDP-43 loss of function results in reduced CSNK1E levels. It was surprising at first that our patient dataset revealed upregulation of CSNK1E mRNA in sALS whereas TDP-43 knockdown showed a decrease in the CSNK1E mRNA levels.
