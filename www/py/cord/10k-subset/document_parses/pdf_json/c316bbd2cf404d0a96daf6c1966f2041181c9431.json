Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to compare clinical and laboratory findings between (i) influenza and dengue and (ii) influenza and OFI. Results: Of 849 enrolled patients, the mean time between illness onset and hospital presentation was 1.7, 3.7, and 3 days for influenza, dengue, and OFI, respectively. Among pediatric patients (\u226418 years) (445 influenza, 24 dengue, and 130 OFI), we identified absence of rashes, no leukopenia, and no marked thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <100 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) as predictors to distinguish influenza from dengue, whereas rhinorrhea, malaise, sore throat, and mild thrombocytopenia (platelet counts 100-149 \u00d7 10 9 /L) were predictors that differentiated influenza from OFI. Among adults (>18 years) (81 influenza, 124 dengue, and 45 OFI), no leukopenia and no marked thrombocytopenia distinguished influenza from dengue, while rhinorrhea and malaise differentiated influenza from OFI. A diagnostic algorithm developed to distinguish influenza from dengue using rash, leukopenia, and marked thrombocytopenia showed >90% sensitivity to identify influenza in pediatric patients. Conclusions: This study identified simple clinical and laboratory parameters that can assist clinicians to distinguish influenza from dengue and OFI.

The spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from mild-form nonspecific febrile illness, such as cough, sore throat, headache, rhinorrhea, malaise, and muscle ache, to respiratory failure and death [2] [3] [4] . Its symptoms and signs can be similar to other viral illnesses such as dengue, making the infections difficult to distinguish. The clinical manifestations of dengue illness vary greatly, ranging from a mild, flu-like, and selflimited febrile illness to severe dengue [5, 6] . Influenza and dengue overlap geographically in tropical and subtropical regions of the world [1, 7] . Concurrent influenza and dengue outbreaks have been reported [8] [9] [10] [11] . The overlapping clinical features of influenza and dengue created clinical diagnosis and management challenges during simultaneous influenza and dengue outbreaks in Puerto Rico in 1977 [11] . Dengue epidemics have occurred in Taiwan for decades [12, 13] . An outbreak of 2009 pandemic H1N1 occurred in Taiwan after the first case was identified on May 20, 2009 [14] . The overlapping symptoms and signs of influenza and dengue created a confusing clinical situation and challenges in etiology identification. Although rapid diagnostic tests can help confirm an influenza diagnosis, their sensitivity ranges from 40-70% depending on the day of illness and specimen type [15] . Definitive diagnosis of dengue is made using serology tests, but these tests are not always readily available in most clinical laboratories [7, 16] . Our study aimed to identify clinical and laboratory features that distinguish influenza from dengue and other febrile illnesses (OFI) in dengue and non-dengue endemic settings. We applied decision tree analysis to our dataset to discriminate patients with influenza from those with dengue.

Early detection of influenza and dengue is especially important because influenza may be prevented through proper isolation and treated using antiviral agents [28, 29] , whereas failure to make a timely dengue diagnosis with adequate fluid replacement can lead to severe dengue [30] . Our study demonstrated that the presence of leukopenia (white cell count <3.0 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) and marked thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) are useful for differentiating dengue from influenza in both adults and pediatric patients. The absence of rash further discriminated influenza from dengue in pediatric patients. Rash associated with influenza is not a common manifestation, occurring in only 2-8% of patients, usually children [31, 32] . In contrast, the reported frequency of rash in dengue cases ranges from 46-68%, particularly in children less than 15 years who usually have a nonspecific febrile syndrome accompanied by rash [33, 34] . Mild leukopenia and relative lymphopenia are typical findings of influenza; thrombocytopenia may be present in complicated cases [4, 14, 25] . Notably, our study and others found leukopenia and thrombocytopenia to be common laboratory findings in dengue infection, with platelet counts below 20 \u00d7 10 9 per liter often observed in severe dengue [7, 30] . A study examining predictors of diagnosis in 1,962 febrile travelers returning from the tropics found the main predictors of dengue infection compared with other fevers, excluding malaria, to include skin rash, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia [35] .
