These specialized membranes wrap around axons to form multilamellar myelin internodes which are required for rapid saltatory conduction of action potentials (reviewed by Ritchie and Chui, 1981; Raine, 1984; Wood and Bunge, 1984) . The gene structure and processing of transcripts for three of the four major myelin proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), have been described (Zeller et al., 1984; de Ferra et al., 1985; Milner et al., 1985; Diehl et al., 1986; Arquint et aL, 1987; Popko et al., 1987; Salzer et al., 1987) . The fourth major myelin protein, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNP), has recently been sequenced from a cDNA clone (Bernier et al., 1987) . Each of these genes is present in the mammalian genome as a single copy, is highly conserved evolutionarily, and is expressed as multiple messenger RNA and protein forms (Bernier et al., 1987; Hudson et al., 1987; Lai et al., 1987) . In the case of MBP, four major transcripts are generated by alternative spicing of two of its seven exons, exons 2 and 6 (de Ferra et ai., 1985; Takahashi et al., 1985; Mentaberry et al., 1986) . Exon 2 information is present in the two transcripts which code for the 21.5-and 17-kDa basic protein isoforms and is absent from the transcripts which encode the 18.5-and 14-kD isoforms: The expression of these proteins is developmentally regulated: the exon 2-containing isoform levels peak during the initial stages of myelination and decrease thereafter (Barbarese et al., 1978 , Carson et al., 1983 , while the levels of the isoforms lacking exon 2 information increase and remain high. Similarly, MBP exon 2-containing transcripts (also referred to as preforms; see Fig. 1 ) are most abundant at the onset of myelination in developing animals and decrease thereafter (Jordan et al., 1989; Kamholz et al., 1988; de Ferra et al., in preparation) . It has been proposed that exon 2 might play a critical role in the early development stages of myelination by coding for an MBP region which may interact with myelin lipids and/or proteins and thereby direct the initial steps in myelin compaction (Kamholz et al., 1986) .",

            "text": "(reviewed by Silberberg, 1986) . Therefore, it is important to elucidate how CNS myelin repair proceeds at the molecular and cellular level in experimental models capable of extensive remyelination. Several demyelinating models produced experimentally by chemical, immunological, or virological agents have been used to study remyelination (reviewed by Ludwin, 1981) . In one mouse model, demyelination is induced by a coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). This and other M H V strains have been shown to infect and kill oligodendrocytes in vivo (Herndon et al., 1977; Knobler et al., 1981; Sorensen et al., 1981; Lavi et al., 1984a; Woyciechowska et al., 1984) . Although there is no direct evidence that MS can be caused by a virus in humans (reviewed by Silberberg, 1986) , MHV-A59 oligodendrocyte infection and subsequent demyelination mimic acute MS lesions, especially in the spinal cord (Lavi et al., 1984a; 1984b; Woyciechowska et al., 1984; Kristensson et al., 1986; Jordan et al., submitted) . Animals develop myelin lesions as well as paresis and ataxia during the first 1-3 weeks of infection. Subsequently infection subsides and is followed by remyelination and functional recovery during the next few weeks. We have initiated a series of studies on the mechanism of CNS remyelination using the MHV-A59 demyelinating model. In this study, we ask the following question: Does myelin gene expression in remyelination follow the same regulated program observed during myelination? We chose a major myelin protein gene (MBP) whose expression during development has been studied in detail to analyze transcript expression during remyelination. We observed earlier a substantial increase in MBP transcripts in the vicinity of demyelinating lesions in MHV-infected mice (Kristensson et al., 1986) . In this study we used probes specific to particular exons to analyze whether forms of MBP transcripts seen in early development were detectable in oligodendrocytes during remyelination after experimental demyelinating disease. We find that during the early stages of remyelination, exon 2-containing MBP transcripts are increased in abundance and clustered around the oligodendrocyte nucleus, just as in early myelination. These molecular changes were found in demyelinated spinal cord lesions at the earliest timesof remyelination. At later stages of remyelination, additional forms of MBP transcripts (without exon 2) increased and their distribution was diffuse throughout the cells. This indicates that during remyelination, preforms of MBP transcripts which are normally at low levels in the adult CNS are abundantly expressed and regulated in a manner similar to that observed in neonatal myelination.",

At this time, the demyelinated lesions occupied approximately 5-20% of the total spinal cord tissue and the first indications of remyelination: could be seen histologically in some lesions (Jordan et al., submitted) .

Radioactive counts were expressed as ratios of exon 2-containing/small MBP transcripts (Table I) since previous experiments had indicated that this ratio changes dramatically during normal myelination in the first few weeks after birth (Jordan et al., 1989; de Ferra et al., in preparation) . At 3 WPI, infected animals showed a 50% increase over control animals in the ratio of exon 2-containing transcripts to small MBP transcripts. Similar results were obtained from a second group of animals sacrificed at 3 WPI. The changes in this ratio suggest that MBP transcripts containing exon 2 were increased in total spinal cord mRNAs at 3 WPI.

In order to elucidate whether the relative abundance of exon 2-containing transcripts could be correlated with the topography of the demyelination and remyelination, we used probes specific for particular exons in in stiu hybridization experiments. Two synthetic~ o!igonucleotide: probes labeled with 35S dATP were used, one specific for MBP exon 1, which is present in all MBP transcripts, and one specific for exon 2, which is present only in the pre-MBP forms. These two probes of equal specific activity were, hybridized under identical conditions to proximate spinal cord sections taken from animals at various times postinfection and their binding was detected by autoradiography. Thus, an accurate comparison of exon 1-containing total transcripts (including those containing exon 2) versus exon 2-specific transcripts could beperformed on the sections. Sections from agematched mice were always included in experiments so that probe binding in myelinated and demyelinated regions of experimental sections could be directly compared to normal. Additionally, probes for other gene transcripts were utilized in parallel and served to validate uniform preparation of tissues and probe penetration (Jordan et al., submitted) . We first examined mice at 3 WPI because this was the time at which a relative increase in exon 2-containing transcripts was detected by RNase protection assays (Table I) . Demyelinated lesions were visualized by staining sections with Sudan black for myelin (arrows, Fig. 2A ) and with cresyl violet for cellular infiltrates (Fig. 2B) ; the latter coincide with regions of myelin loss. When nearby sections were hybridized with the MBP exon 1 probe, the majority of the white matter regions was found to have a moderately low level of total MBP transcripts. In contrast, total MBP transcripts were greatly reduced within areas of demyelination (Fig. 2C , long arrow), as described before (Kristensson et al., 1986) . However, clusters of transcripts could be found with both exon 1-and exon 2-specific probes in cells scattered in some demyelinating lessions (Figs. 2C, D, E, and F). Such clusters of transcripts were not seen in normal white matter regions of infected mice or in age-matched uninfected controls, where only diffused labeling was found. When regions of demyelination were examined under higher magnification, most clusters of grains for either exon 1 (Fig. 2E ) or exon 2 (Fig. 2F ) probes were found associated with cell nuclei. A similar distribution of MBP transcripts has been observed at early developmental stages of myelination (Trapp et al., 1987; Jordan et al., 1989) . The numbers of grains in exon 1-and exon 2-positive clusters within the lesion were similar.. Since the two probes were of equal specific activity, and the exon 1 probe can detect all MBP transcripts including the subset of exon 2-containing preforms, we can conclude that the great majority of MBP transcripts in oligodendrocyte cell bodies within the lesions contained exon 2.",

When sections proximate to that in Fig. 3A were hybridized with the MBP exon 2 probe, ventral root zones and the upper edge of the dorsal funiculus showed increased levels of hybridization (Figs. 3C and E) . When an adjacent section was hybridized with the MBP exon 1 probe, these same regions also showed increased binding and the binding intensity with exon 1 probe was much higher than with exon 2 (arrows, Fig. 3D ), This indicates a significant contribution of non-exon 2-containing forms to the level of total MBP transcripts. Thus, additional forms of MBP transcripts (probably coding for the large and small MBP forms) were more abundant at later times after infection.",

This increase seemed significant since the RNA was isolated from whole spinal cord, while the demyelinated regions occupied only 5-20% of spinal cord tissue. These results encouraged us to perform in situ hybridization experiments with exon 2and exon 1-specific probes in order to visualize the topographical distribution of early and mature MBP transcripts within lesions, around lesions, and in remote myelinated areas. These experiments clearly demonstrated that exon 2-containing transcripts were increased in the lesion even though total MBP transcripts were decreased by 75%. Scattered oligodendrocytes were found with clusters of grains around their nucleus in lesions showing early signs of remyelination. Our quantitative analysis of film autoradiograms of spinal cord sections also indicated a dramatic enrichment in the subset of transcripts containing exon 2 in lesions, peaking at 5 WPI (17-fold increase; Fig. 5B ).",

Evidence that this is indeed the case in these remyelinating animals rests on the following observations. (1) Precursor cells of oligodendrocytes expressing the 04 antigen (Sommer and Schachner 1981; Dubois-Dalcq 1987) could be isolated from these animals in substantial numbers when remyelination was starting (Armstrong et al., 1988) . (2) Such 04 + ceils were identified in spinal cord sections of similar animals and a proportion of these cells had incorporated thymidine after a short pulse in vivo (Godfraind et al., 1988) . (3) When animals pulse labeled with thymidine at 3 WPI were allowed to survive 5 months, thymidine-labeled oligodendrocytes expressing myelin proteins were found (Godfraind et al., in preparation) . All of these results point to precursor cell involvement in the myelin repair. It is possible that these precursor cells repopulate the demyelinated regions (where oligodendrocytes are scarce) through a process of mitosis and migration and then go through their differentiation program.",

As discussed before (Kristensson et al., 1986) such an increase in transcripts could be induced by a diffusable factor, possibly generated by inflammatory cells in the lesion, such as interleukin 2 as suggested by in vitro studies (Benveniste and Merril, 1986) . In contrast, a generalized decrease in MBP transcripts was observed in the rest of the normal myelinated regions when compared to control. Such a decrease might be related to the widespread distribution of virus and/or the reactive astrocyte gliosis which occurs early in the disease (Jordan et al., submitted) .",
