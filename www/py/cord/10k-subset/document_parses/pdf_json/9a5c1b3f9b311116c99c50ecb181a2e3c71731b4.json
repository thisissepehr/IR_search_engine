            "text": "mutation raises the threat of a novel pandemic strain. Antiviral drugs exhibit limited efficacy unless administered early and may induce viral resistance. Thus, targeting the host response directly has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy with the added potential benefit of not eliciting viral resistance. Severe influenza virus infections are complicated by respiratory failure due to the development of lung microvascular leak and acute lung injury. We hypothesized that enhancing lung endothelial barrier integrity could improve the outcome. Here we demonstrate that the Tie2agonist tetrameric peptide Vasculotide improves survival in murine models of severe influenza, even if administered as late as 72 hours after infection; the benefit was observed using three strains of the virus and two strains of mice. The effect required Tie2, was independent of viral replication and did not impair lung neutrophil recruitment. Administration of the drug decreased lung edema, arterial hypoxemia and lung endothelial apoptosis; importantly, Vasculotide is inexpensive to produce, is chemically stable and is unrelated to any Tie2 ligands. Thus, Vasculotide may represent a novel and practical therapy for severe infections with influenza.",

Despite vaccination programs and antiviral drugs, seasonal influenza alone causes millions of cases of severe illness and hundreds of thousands of deaths annually 1, 2 . There are concerns that ongoing mutation will lead to a novel strain of the virus that is both highly transmissible and highly virulent, as occurred in the 1918 pandemic leading to the deaths of 50 million people 3 . Existing treatments for the virus are inadequate: antiviral drugs are not completely effective at reducing mortality 4, 5 and exhibit declining efficacy unless given at the time of infection, a problematic limitation since the time of infection is usually unknown 6, 7 . There is also the problem of antiviral resistance; of the two classes of drugs approved for use against influenza, one is largely ineffective due to widespread resistance, while sporadic cases of resistance to the other have been reported 8, 9 . Thus, there is a need for novel therapies; those that target the host rather than the pathogen may be ideal as they should be less susceptible to viral resistance.",

Furthermore, virus-induced hypoxemia and lung edema were greatly ameliorated with the drug (Fig. 1c-d) . Echocardiography revealed that lung edema was not due to impairment of left ventricular systolic function by the virus, consistent with an increase in vascular leak from lung injury 13 ; analogously, the reduction in lung edema by Vasculotide was not from an improvement in left ventricular systolic function (Fig. 1e) . Of note, the drug was similarly effective against a lethal dose of PR8 (H1N1), a second strain of influenza virus that is highly virulent in mice 17 (Fig. 1f) . Next, we infected mice with the 2009 swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Although the mortality rate in these mice was only 25%, all of the Vasculotide-treated mice survived (Supplemental Figure 4) . Thus, Vasculotide appears to be effective against lung injury caused by multiple strains of influenza.",

Second, Vasculotide did not affect chemotaxis of human and murine monocytes and neutrophils in vitro (Fig. 4b-c and data not shown). To our surprise, despite significantly improved arterial oxygen saturation and body weight ( Fig. 4d -e), Vasculotide-treated mice exhibited no difference in the severity of lung injury determined by blinded quantification of lung histology at 5 days post-infection ( Fig. 4g ) (this timepoint was chosen as infected mice die soon afterwards). Concordantly, while infection induced a marked increase in alveolar neutrophil recruitment, this was unaffected by treatment with Vasculotide ( Fig. 4f ); alveolar and serum cytokine levels on day 5 post-infection were also unaffected (Supplemental Figure 6 ). Thus, the mechanism of benefit of Vasculotide appears downstream of innate immune responses and instead involves the lung endothelial barrier.",

The effect of the drug is Tie2-dependent, appears to be downstream of innate immune activation and does not require inhibition of viral replication. Second, the enhancement of lung endothelial barrier integrity did not impair leukocyte recruitment to the lung, supporting the notion that vascular leak and leukocyte transmigration may be regulated independently 23 . Accordingly, administration of Vasculotide at the time of infection (i.e. even before leukocyte infiltration could occur) was not harmful and still conferred great benefit (Fig. 1b) . Lastly, administration of Vasculotide even 3-4 days after infection significantly improved survival, an observation with practical implications given that the moment of infection in patients is usually uncertain.",

            "text": "While other ligands for Tie2 have been studied as therapies for vascular leak (as reviewed in 24 ), none have been reported in severe influenza virus infection and almost all required administration to be prophylactic or simultaneous with the time of infection 25, 26 , limiting their clinical utility. The potential clinical use of recombinant angiopoietin 1, the endogenous ligand for Tie2, is limited by its tendency to bind to the extracellular matrix and to form undesirable aggregates 27 ; furthermore, modified forms of the protein are reportedly difficult to synthesize and are unstable 27 . In contrast, Vasculotide was invented based on phage display experiments in which over 1 billion unique peptides were screened to identify those capable of binding with high affinity to Tie2 28, 29 . Vasculotide bears no sequence homology to angiopoietin-1 and exhibits no activity against or binding to some 500 cellular receptors (unpublished data); its specificity for Tie2 is also strongly supported by our data using Tie2 haploinsufficient mice. Given the existing literature on Ang1 and other putative barrier-enhancing agents 14, 26, 30 , the ability of delayed administration of Vasculotide to rescue mice dying of influenza (Supplemental Figure 2 ) is unexpected and novel. This finding, combined with its relatively low cost of production and its chemical stability, suggests that the drug might constitute a practical therapy. Our data indicate that Vasculotide increases endothelial barrier integrity and reduces lung endothelial apoptosis, consistent with its agonism of Tie2 31 . Further work will determine whether it affects other mediators of vascular instability including angiopoietin-2 32 and VE-PTP 33 . As its mechanism of action is independent of viral replication and instead involves modulation of the host response, it is possible that Vasculotide may not engender viral resistance, but this hypothesis will require direct testing. Since influenza virus infections are often complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia 34 , novel agents that impair the innate immune response may not be without risk. The fact that Vasculotide does not impede neutrophil recruitment to the lung is therefore reassuring. Finally, whether the impressive benefit of Vasculotide in the therapy of the influenza virus carries implications for other infectious agents 35 or non-infectious causes of ARDS will require further investigation.",

Immunoblotting was performed as previously described 44 with the exception of the blocking step, which used 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS instead of 5% milk. In some experiments, lung homogenates were generated from infected mice as follows: after euthanasia, the circulation was flushed with 10 mL ice-cold PBS. The lungs were homogenized in buffer containing 137 mM NaCL, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCL, 5 mM Sodium orthovanadate, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets and separated using 8% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked for 1 hour in 5% milk in TBS, and probed overnight with primary antibody at 4 \u00b0C. After washing, blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour, washed, and then visualized by chemiluminescence (ThermoScientific). Band intensity was quantified using ImageJ (NIH) and normalized to the loading control after background correction. The anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody was from Cell Signaling; the anti-Tie2 (C20) antibody was from Santa Cruz; all other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.",

Some wells received VT alone or in combination with thrombin at a concentration of 20 ng/mL. Controls received 20 \u03bc l medium without thrombin.

MTT and media were aspirated and the cells were solubilized in 100 uL DMSO and shaken for 5 minutes. Absorbance was measured at 538 nm. For the scratch assay, HPMECs were grown to confluency on 12-well tissue culture plates marked on the bottom with an open square to define the scratch area. A single scratch was made through the scratch area using a sterile p1000 pipette tip. The initial scratch area was imaged by phase-contrast microscopy. Cells were washed once with media and then treated with EGM-2 or EGM-2 with 20 ng/ mL VT for 24 hours. After 24 hours the cells were imaged again to assess the degree of wound healing. Phase-contrast images were exported to ImageJ for quantification of baseline and endpoint wound areas. Wound healing is expressed as a fraction of the endpoint area occupied by cells over the baseline scratch area. Quantification of wound healing was performed in a blinded fashion.",
