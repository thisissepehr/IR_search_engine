            "text": "The homologous p10 fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins of the avian (ARV) and Nelson Bay (NBV) reoviruses are the smallest known viral membrane fusion proteins, and are virulence determinants of the fusogenic reoviruses. The small size of FAST proteins is incompatible with the paradigmatic membrane fusion pathway proposed for enveloped viral fusion proteins. Understanding how these diminutive viral fusogens mediate the complex process of membrane fusion is therefore of considerable interest, from both the pathogenesis and mechanism-of-action perspectives. Using chimeric ARV/NBV p10 constructs, the 36-40-residue ectodomain was identified as the major determinant of the differing fusion efficiencies of these homologous p10 proteins. Extensive mutagenic analysis determined the ectodomain comprises two distinct, essential functional motifs. Syncytiogenesis assays, thiol-specific surface biotinylation, and liposome lipid mixing assays identified an ,25-residue, N-terminal motif that dictates formation of a cystine loop fusion peptide in both ARV and NBV p10. Surface immunofluorescence staining, FRET analysis and cholesterol depletion/repletion studies determined the cystine loop motif is connected through a two-residue linker to a 13-residue membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER). The MPER constitutes a second, independent motif governing reversible, cholesterol-dependent assembly of p10 multimers in the plasma membrane. Results further indicate that: (1) ARV and NBV homomultimers segregate to distinct, cholesterol-dependent microdomains in the plasma membrane; (2) p10 homomultimerization and cholesterol-dependent microdomain localization are co-dependent; and (3) the four juxtamembrane MPER residues present in the multimerization motif dictate species-specific microdomain association and homomultimerization. The p10 ectodomain therefore constitutes a remarkably compact, multifunctional fusion module that directs syncytiogenic efficiency and species-specific assembly of p10 homomultimers into cholesterol-dependent fusion platforms in the plasma membrane.

Bat populations may serve as a major reservoir for emerging human viral infections [2] [3] [4] [5] . Genus Orthoreovirus is one of 15 recognized genera in Family Reoviridae, a large, diverse group of nonenveloped viruses with segmented, double-stranded RNA genomes [6] . Several novel orthoreoviruses of pteropine origin have recently been isolated, and six of these isolates were associated with acute respiratory infections in humans [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, a serological survey revealed 13% of 109 random serum samples of subjects in Malaysia were seropositive for pteropine reoviruses [12] , indicating zoonotic transmission of fusogenic bat reoviruses may be a frequent event. Monitoring agencies have recommended close monitoring of orthoreovirus evolution, as well as a necessity for further research to allow for prevention and control measures to be taken in the event of zoonotic transmission [13] .",

Human infections with non-fusogenic mammalian reoviruses (MRVs) are commonplace and generally asymptomatic [15] . In contrast, natural infections with fusogenic orthoreoviruses induce an array of pathologies in virus-infected animals; baboon reovirus (BRV) is associated with meningoencephalomyelitis in juvenile baboons [16] , reptilian reoviruses (RRVs) cause pneumonia and neurological dysfunction [17, 18] , and avian reoviruses (ARVs) are the causative agents of a wide range of diseases that include arthritis and enteric disease syndromes [19] . Syncytium formation is mediated by nonstructural, fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins encoded by all fusogenic orthoreoviruses, and by fusogenic aquareoviruses in the closely related Genus Aquareovirus [20] . These are the only known membrane fusion proteins encoded by non-enveloped viruses. The FAST proteins are not involved in viral entry, but instead induce fusion between virus-infected and neighboring uninfected cells, thereby promoting virus dissemination [21] . The extent of syncytiogenesis correlates with viral pathogenicity [22] , and mice intranasally infected with a chimeric, FAST protein-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) showed increased neuropathology [23] . The FAST proteins are therefore virulence determinants of the fusogenic reoviruses.",

Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests the fusogenic reoviruses arose from an ancestral, nonfusogenic virus by at least two separate gain-of-function events, possibly involving divergent evolution from one or more precursor non-structural proteins that were membrane-interactive, but nonfusogenic, [20, 30] . The FAST proteins share no identifiable sequence similarity with each other, or with any other known membrane fusion protein, and each possesses a unique repertoire and arrangement of functional motifs. Defining attributes of family members include their small size (95-198 amino acids), presence of a single-pass transmembrane domain (TMD) with N exoplasmic / C endoplasmic membrane topology resulting in ectodomains of ,40 residues, sites for fatty-acid modification (N-terminal myristoylation or palmitoylation of membrane proximal Cys residues), a cluster of membrane-proximal basic residues on the cytoplasmic side of the TMD, a short hydrophobic or amphipathic motif that can be located on either side of the TMD, and an intrinsically disordered cytoplasmic tail [25, 27, [31] [32] [33] . Determining how these motifs function in a coordinated manner to mediate membrane fusion is critical to our understanding of how these unusual viral fusion proteins mediate syncytiogenesis, and how this process influences viral pathogenesis.",

Although enveloped virus fusion proteins possess considerable architectural diversity, remarkable similarities exist in the dynamic structural rearrangements undertaken throughout the fusion reaction [35] . Triggered conformational changes result in extensive structural remodeling of complex, multimeric ectodomains that expose and project hydrophobic fusion peptides (FPs) toward the target cell membrane, followed by folding back of the extended intermediate structure into a compact trimeric hairpin structure. FPs are critical for fusion activity, they are extremely sensitive to mutation, and can exist as either internal fusion loops or as N-terminal a-helices [36] . Membrane merger is believed to be mediated by bilayer deformation, using the energy released as the metastable, prefusion structure transitions to the lowest energy, post-fusion conformation and/or by membrane curvature effects induced by FP partitioning into bilayers [34, 37] . Membrane-proximal external regions (MPERs) of several enveloped viral fusion proteins have also been shown to play active roles in the membrane fusion reaction [38] [39] [40] [41] . These short, hydrophobic, frequently tryptophan-rich sequences partition into lipid bilayers where they may influence bilayer stabilization or curvature [42] . Despite extensive study of numerous enveloped virus fusogens, a clear picture on the specific role of FPs, MPERS, and quaternary structural transitions in the fusion reaction has not emerged.",

As nonstructural proteins involved in cell-cell fusion, not virus-cell fusion, the relationship between syncytium formation and viral pathogenesis can also be analyzed in the absence of confounding virus entry effects. The p10 proteins are the only FAST proteins with numerous homologs, which segregate into two host-specific clades ( Figure 1 ); an avian clade and the newly emerged pteropine reoviruses associated with severe human respiratory infections. The rate of syncytiogenesis varies considerably between representatives of the avian and pteropine clades [21] . There is extensive sequence divergence between p10 clades (,30% amino acid identity), but they share an identical arrangement of structural motifs ( Figure 1 ). The ARV and NBV p10 FAST proteins comprise a central transmembrane domain flanked by approximately equal sized (,40 residue) ecto-and endodomains ( Figure 1 ). The ectodomain contains a moderately hydrophobic region, termed the hydrophobic patch (HP), flanked by two conserved Cys residues, which were shown to form an intramolecular disulfide bond, creating an 11-residue cystine loop FP [43, 44] . The ectodomain also contains a 9-residue conserved motif (CM) of unknown function that is invariant in all p10 isolates. The endodomain is the most diverged region of p10, but contains two conserved Cys residues immediately adjacent to the TMD, which in ARV p10 were shown to be palmitoylated [45] , followed by a short region of moderately conserved basic residues known as the polybasic (PB) motif ( Figure 1 ); both of these endodomain motifs are required for syncytium formation [45] . To date, relatively little attention has been given to bat reovirus p10 proteins, or to exploiting comparative approaches using the two p10 clades to better define structure-function relationships.",

The fusogenic capacity of these viruses, attributable to a unique family of fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins, is a correlate of virulence. The FAST proteins are the only known examples of nonenveloped virus membrane fusion proteins, and they are the smallest known viral fusogens whose structural and functional attributes are incompatible with current models of protein-mediated membrane fusion. Exploiting the sequence divergence and distinct syncytiogenic rates of representative p10 FAST proteins from avian and bat reovirus isolates, we determined the p10 ectodomain is a compact, complex fusion module comprising two independent functional motifs. One motif determines species-specific p10 fusion efficiency by governing formation of a cystine loop fusion peptide, while the other directs reversible clustering and multimerization of p10 in cholesterol-dependent membrane microdomains. Remarkably, a juxtamembrane tetra-peptide is solely responsible for co-dependent clustering and multimerization of p10 in distinct, species-specific fusion platforms. This is the first example of a viral fusogen utilizing a membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER) to direct cholesterol-dependent multimerization and assembly into fusion platforms. p10 Multifunctional Ectodomain directing p10 multimerization and clustering into plasma membrane microdomains.

Using sequential PCR reactions, the homologous ectodomains, TMDs and endodomains of ARV and NBV p10 were exchanged to generate six chimeric p10 proteins ( Figure 2A ). Chimeras were named to reflect the proportion of domains stemming from each parental p10 protein. For example, the chimeric ARV protein containing the NBV ectodomain is termed ARVectoNBV (abbreviated AectoN). FACS analysis and western blotting indicated no significant differences in cell surface and total expression levels of FLAG-tagged versions of the chimeric proteins ( Figure 2B ). Quantitative syncytiogenesis assays revealed the relative contribution of each domain to the overall syncytiogenic rate ( Figure 2C ). Exchanging the TMDs or endodomains of ARV and NBV p10 had no effect on the rate or extent of syncytium formation; AtmN and AendoN had identical syncytiogenic kinetics as parental ARV p10 ( Figure 2C , bottom two panels). The same situation applied for NBV p10 containing an ARV p10 TMD or endodomain (i.e. NtmA and NendoA chimeras), both of which shared the fusogenic activity of the parental NBV p10 ( Figure 2C , bottom two panels). In contrast, an NBV ectodomain substantially increased the syncytiogenic activity of ARV p10 while an ARV ectodomain impaired the fusogenic activity of NBV p10 ( Figure 2C , top panel). Interestingly, the two ectodomain chimeras had intermediate syncytiogenic activities relative to the parental p10 proteins, indicating the ectodomains directly contribute to the differing fusion activities of ARV and NBV p10 but require a homotypic TMD or endodomain to confer the full fusion phenotype of the parental proteins.",

These constructs exchanged sequences bracketing the cystine loop (constructs A1, A3, N1, and N3), the sequences within the Cys-flanked HP (constructs A2 and N2), the non-conserved residue adjacent to the N-terminus of the CM (constructs A4 and N4), and the four membrane-proximal residues (constructs A5 and N5). Quantitative syncytiogenesis assays revealed chimeras composed of residues exchanged within or flanking the HP were all inactive for syncytium formation ( Figure 3B) . A cell-surface biotinylation assay, previously employed to identify a cysteine loop in ARV p10 [43] , determined NBV p10 also forms a cystine loop; cells had to be treated with DTT before plasma-membrane localized NBV p10 could react with the thiol-specific biotinylation reagent ( Figure 3C ). More notably, fusion-dead ARV and NBV p10 constructs (A1-A3 and N1-N3) could all be biotinylated without DTT treatment, indicating the presence of free thiols and inability to form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Conversely, constructs with substitutions flanking the CM (A4, A5, N4 and N5) remained fusion-active ( Figure 3B ) and retained the cystine loop ( Figure 3C ). Thus, the N-terminal ,25 ectodomain residues of ARV and NBV p10 define a single motif required for speciesspecific formation and fusion activity of an essential cystine loopbased FP.",

Acute extraction of cholesterol from QM5 cells expressing N-terminally FLAG-tagged ARV p10 using methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD) resulted in a dose-dependent alteration in p10 plasma membrane staining from punctate to diffuse ( Figure  S2B ). Live-cell fluorescence imaging with C-terminally GFPtagged p10 indicated the punctate plasma membrane localization of p10 was rapidly converted to a diffuse staining pattern following addition of MbCD to cells (Video S1). Most interestingly, the diffuse, overlapping staining pattern of ARV and NBV p10 in the absence of cholesterol rapidly reverted to segregated, homotypic, punctate staining when membrane cholesterol was restored using cholesterol-loaded MbCD ( Figure 4D ).

A C9S substitution in ARV p10, which abrogates cystine loop formation and syncytiogenesis [43] , had no effect on p10 clustering ( Figure  S2C ), indicating the cystine loop FP motif does not influence p10 cell surface distribution. To determine whether the CM plays any role in p10 microdomain association, each non-Ala/Gly residue of the ARV p10 CM was individually point-substituted with either a conserved residue or with Ala, while each Ala/Gly residue was individually substituted to the obverse ( Figure 5A ). Surface immunofluorescence and syncytiogenesis assays with these 14 CM point substitutions revealed changes to the CM eliminated p10-induced syncytium formation ( Figure 5A ) and generated a diffuse surface-staining pattern ( Figure 5B , top and middle rows). The four diverged, juxtamembrane residues of the MPER, hereinafter referred to as the neck region, connect the TMD to the CM and can be exchanged in the ARV and NBV p10 proteins with no effects on syncytiogenesis ( Figure 3B ). However, substitution of these neck residues with Ala had the same effect as CM substitutions, abrogating both p10-induced syncytium formation ( Figure 5A ) and clustering in membrane microdomains ( Figure 5B , bottom row).

(A) QM5 cells cotransfected with N-terminally FLAG-tagged ARV p10 and N-terminally myc-tagged NBV p10 were fixed without permeabilization, and surfacelocalized ARV and NBV p10 detected using mouse-a-FLAG and rabbit-a-myc antisera, respectively. Bound antibodies were detected with Alexa Fluor 488 goat-a-mouse (green) and Alexa Fluor 647 goat-a-rabbit (red), and superposed in the merged image. (B) As in panel A, except cells were cotransfected with N-terminally FLAG-tagged ARV (top row) or NBV (bottom row) p10 and the indicated N-terminally myc-tagged chimeric constructs. (C) As in panel A, except cells were co-transfected with N-terminally FLAG-tagged ARV or NBV p10 and N-terminally myc-tagged versions of the indicated ectodomain chimeras. D) QM5 cell monolayers co-transfected with N-terminally FLAG-tagged ARV p10 and N-terminally myc-tagged NBV p10 were incubated with 20 mM MbCD for 20 min to deplete membrane cholesterol. Cells were then either fixed or cholesterol was repleted by treatment with MbCD-cholesterol complexes for 30 min prior to fixation. Cells were fixed and stained as in panel A. Scale bars = 10 mm.

Fusion-deficient constructs therefore exert a potent dominant-negative effect, but only when co-localized to the same membrane microdomain as a parental p10 protein. Lastly, coexpressing ARV or NBV p10 with heterotypic neck region substitution constructs that co-localize with each other (i.e., ARV p10 with NBV N5, or NBV p10 with ARV A5 in Figure 5D ) resulted in approximately equivalent, intermediate fusion phenotypes; syncytium formation was more extensive than that induced by ARV p10 alone but reduced relative to NBV p10 alone ( Figure 6A ). Taken together, these results indicate each punctum represents a ''fusion unit'', with overall fusion efficiency being dictated by the population of p10 proteins present in individual puncta. Figure 5 . CM and neck region residues are essential for p10 clustering in plasma membranes and neck region residues determine species-specific p10 homotypic clustering.

Since the efficiency of energy transfer between fluorophores varies inversely to the 6 th power of the distance between donor and acceptor fluorophores, FRET only occurs if the average spatial separation of the fluorophores is ,5-10 nm, a distance only stably observed during direct protein-protein interactions [49] . ARV and NBV p10 proteins were C-terminally tagged with either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or a monomeric derivative of red fluorescent protein (mCherry), a FRET pair with good spectral overlap but low donor-acceptor cross-talk levels [50] . The PixFRET Image-J plug-in [51] was used to calculate donor and acceptor spectral bleed-through (SBT) values and normalized FRET (NFRET) intensities using pixel-by-pixel analysis of sensitized emission FRET, and mean NFRET (mNFRET) values were determined for 10 cells in each of two separate experiments. Positive controls included a uni-molecular FRET pair (i.e., EGFP directly attached to mCherry via a flexible linker) and a bimolecular FRET pair, the multimeric p14 FAST protein, both of which gave positive FRET signals ( Figure 7A ). The negative controls, ARV-GFP co-expressed with free mCherry ( Figure 7B ) and ARV-mCherry co-expressed with free GFP (data not shown), yielded no detectible FRET signals.",

Two representative CM substitutions that abrogate ARV p10 plasma clustering (D31E and T35A) also eliminated multimerization as shown by loss of FRET signal ( Figure 8A) . Similarly, co-expressing ARV p10-GFP with mCherry-tagged ARV p10 containing either Ala substitutions of the four neck residues (A-neck construct) or the heterologous neck residues from NBV p10 (ARV A5 construct) eliminated the FRET signal, as did similar co-transfections with NBV p10 constructs ( Figure 8A ); all of these neck constructs also abrogated fusion activity and p10 clustering in the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 ). Conversely, co-expression of ARV p10 with the NBV N5 construct (NBV p10 with the four neck residues of ARV p10), or co-expression of NBV p10 with the corresponding ARV A5 construct, both generated positive FRET signals ( Figure 8A ) and co-clustered in the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 ). Additionally, cholesterol extraction with MbCD eliminated the detectible FRET signal ( Figure 8B ), indicating p10 multimerization and p10 clustering in the plasma membrane are both cholesterol-dependent. The MPER therefore controls cholesteroldependent, reversible homomultimerization and clustering of p10 in plasma membrane fusion platforms, while the tetra-peptide neck residues are solely responsible for determining multimer specificity.",

Understanding what dictates the fusogenic capacity of the FAST proteins is therefore of some interest. Our comparative analysis of the homologous avian and pteropine orthoreovirus p10 FAST proteins revealed the small ectodomains of these rudimentary fusogens operate as remarkably compact, multifunctional fusion modules that function as the predominant determinant of species-specific p10 fusion efficiency. Mechanistically, the ectodomain comprises two separate components, one of which directs formation of a cystine loop FP and the other co-dependent clustering and multimerization of p10 in plasma membrane microdomains. Plasma membrane clustering and multimerization are cholesterol-dependent, required for syncytiogenesis, reversible, and governed by the MPER, which includes a juxtamembrane tetra-peptide solely responsible for species-specific p10 clustering in microdomains and homomultimerization. Most notably, co-transfections revealed that overall syncytiogenic efficiency is dictated by the p10 composition of individual microdomains, identifying these p10 plasma membrane clusters as multimeric FAST protein fusion platforms.",

While fusion efficiency correlated with the parental source of the ectodomain, chimeras required a homotypic TMD or endodomain to display the full fusion capacity of the parental p10 protein contributing the ectodomain. A similar situation occurs with influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), although in this instance it reflects the preference for a homotypic combination of TMD and endodomain [52] . How these individual domains function in concert during the fusion process has not been determined, either for the FAST proteins or for enveloped virus fusogens. However, prior studies determined FAST protein TMDs and endodomains are required for fusion pore formation and expansion [32, 53, 54] , while their ectodomains mediate the early lipid mixing stage of membrane fusion [43, 44, 47, 55] . Ectodomain-mediated lipid mixing leading to pore formation may therefore be more efficient when pore stabilization and expansion are mediated by a homotypic TMD and/or endodomain.",

Changing the clustering pattern of p10 by exchanging MPER neck motifs did not alter syncytiogenic activity of the parental p10 constructs. For example, the A5 construct (ARV p10 with an NBV neck) had an NBV plasma membrane segregation phenotype ( Figure 5 ) but an ARV p10 fusion phenotype (Figure 3) , indicating fusion efficiency is not affected by the species-specific microdomain with which p10 associates. Lipid mixing activities of the p10 ectodomain peptides did, however, correlate with p10 fusion efficiency ( Figure 2D ). The ARV p10 ectodomain was recently shown to form an essential cystine loop FP [43] , results we have now extended to NBV p10 ( Figure 3) . Furthermore, the ARV and NBV cystine loops are not interchangeable, a reflection of the remarkable sensitivity of disulfide bond formation to speciesspecific sequences within, and flanking, the p10 loop ( Figure 3) . Remarkably, despite the extreme sensitivity of disulfide bond formation to minor sequence changes, substitutions in the CM (D31E and T35A) that disrupt clustering and multimerization did not affect disulfide bond formation (Figures 5 and 8) , indicating monomeric p10 contains the essential cystine loop FP and is theoretically functional (see below). The N-terminal 21-25 residues of p10 have therefore evolved as an independent structural and functional motif whose sequence-specific geometry is required for formation or stability of an essential cystine loop FP.",

            "text": "We also identified a second independent ectodomain motif that defines a new role for a viral fusogen MPER, namely cholesteroldependent homomultimerization. MPERs in viral fusogens tend to be short (,10-20 residues), hydrophobic or amphiphilic sequences frequently enriched in aromatic residues [42] . Their ability to adopt amphipathic helical structures, self-aggregate, and partition into membrane interfacial regions suggests the role of MPERs in membrane fusion reflects their ability to perturb bilayer structure [38, 39, 41, 56, 57] . In contrast, the 13-residue MPERs of ARV and NBV p10 are mostly polar and almost devoid of aromatic residues, and their essential role in membrane fusion is to direct reversible, cholesterol-dependent p10 multimerization. Although noted as an invariant sequence in all p10 isolates from avian and pteropine hosts, no functions have previously been ascribed to the CM. FRET analysis and a panel of CM point substitutions suggested a striking requirement for sequence-specific, spatial self-complementarity in the CM to generate a binding interface suitable for p10 multimerization. While homotypic CM interactions are necessary for multimerization, they are not sufficient; stable multimerization only occurred in conjunction with cholesterol-dependent clustering of p10 in plasma membrane microdomains. Cholesteroldependent lateral segregation of proteins and lipids creates submicroscopic membrane domains with unique biophysical properties, such as increased membrane thickness and altered lipid order [58] ; these or other features of lipid microdomains appear to be needed to stabilize low-affinity p10 multimer interactions. Similar co-dependent raft assembly and multimerization have been reported in other systems [59] [60] [61] . While cholesterol microdomains have been implicated in the function of numerous enveloped virus fusogens [62] , we are unaware of any instance where they are needed for enveloped virus fusogen multimerization. The one exception is Semliki Forest virus E1, where FP binding to sterol-and sphingolipid-rich microdomains in the target membrane is required for low-pH-dependent conversion of E1 pre-fusion heterodimers to fusion active homotrimers [63] . In contrast, the cholesterol-dependence of p10 multimerization reflects an undefined functional interaction between the MPER and donor membrane cholesterol needed to convert p10 monomers to stable multimers.",

The ARV p10 construct containing the neck region of NBV (A5 construct) co-clusters with NBV p10 (Figure 5) , while an ARV p10 C9S substitution prevents formation of the cystine loop and eliminates cell-cell fusion ( Figure 5 ) but has no effect on p10 homotypic clustering ( Figure S2C ). Co-expression of NBV p10 with an equimolar amount of an A5 construct containing the C9S substitution resulted in a 99.15% decrease in NBV p10 syncytiogenesis ( Figure 6B ). Assuming incorporation of one nonfunctional p10 polypeptide into a punctum is sufficient to eliminate fusion activity of the complex, then the 0.8560.53% (SEM, n = 3) of retained syncytiogenic activity would be attributable to clusters containing only parental NBV p10. Based on a binomial distribution, the probability of this percent of clusters containing just parental NBV p10 polypeptides is best approximated by heptameric or octameric clustering (probability of 0.78% and 0.39%, respectively). This interpretation assumes there is a single fusion site formed per cell. It is likely that several functional ''fusion platforms'' are formed on a single cell. By varying the proportion of functional NBV p10 and non-functional ARV A5 C9S ( Figure 6C ), we were able to consider the influence of multiple fusion sites on our previous analysis, as previously reported for rabies virus G protein [64] . Residual fusion activity should equal 1{(1{f n ) s (equation 1), where f is the proportion of functional p10 proteins, n is the number of p10 proteins in a cluster, and s is the number of fusion sites. Fitting our titration data ( Figure 6C ) to this equation returned best-fit values of n = 8.7460.70 and s = 5.1760.94. We interpret these estimates as an indicator that clusters comprise higher-order assemblies of p10 monomers in the range of octamers.",

The clear correlation between p10 clustering and multimerization in membrane microdomains with p10 fusion competency also suggests microdomains increase local plasma membrane concentrations of p10 to generate fusion platforms, similar to cholesteroldependent assembly of exocytic SNARE complexes into fusion sites [68] . This conclusion is strengthened by results indicating only non-functional constructs that co-clustered and co-multimerized with parental p10 proteins exerted dominant-negative effects. For example, CM substitutions (D31E and T35A) display a diffuse plasma membrane staining pattern ( Figure 5B ), do not multimerize with ARV p10 (Figure 8 ) and exert no dominantnegative effects ( Figure 6A ). Conversely, fusion dead constructs that colocalized with parental p10 (e.g. ARV p10 C9S) inhibited parental fusion activity ( Figure 6B ), while functional neck region chimeras generated heterotypic puncta and a syncytiogenic phenotype intermediate between ARV and NBV p10 proteins ( Figure 6A ). Overall syncytiogenic efficiency is therefore determined not by the number of p10 microdomains but by their compositional p10 bias, indicating individual puncta define a fusion unit.",

            "text": "While the CM and neck region of the MPER both control microdomain association and multimerization, the tetra-peptide neck is solely responsible for segregation of p10 into speciesspecific microdomains. How proteins partition into lipid rafts remains an unresolved issue in membrane biology [58] . Recent developments in the field suggest the presence of compositionally distinct membrane microdomains differing in their lipid composition, length and asymmetry of N-acyl fatty acids, and hydration status of polar headgroups. These biophysical properties provide lipid environments capable of discriminating between different membrane-associated proteins [69] . For example, HIV env and Ebola GP segregate to different lipid microdomains, both of which can be recruited by Gag to generate HIV particles with a single type of glycoprotein [70] . Proteins may also directly contribute to raft heterogeneity by specifically recruiting and stabilizing a localized lipid environment. Palmitoylation of membrane-proximal cysteines and hydrophobic matching between the lengths of acyl chains and TMDs are the two most common protein features associated with raft recruitment and protein localization to membrane microdomains [71, 72] . As we now show, MPERs can also function as microdomain sorting signals. The tetrapeptide neck of p10 provides a remarkably specific sorting signal capable of segregating two homologous membrane proteins into distinct cholesterol-dependent microdomains. This sorting event occurs in the plasma membrane, and is fully reversible following cholesterol depletion and repletion.",

            "text": "There are several feasible explanations for how the p10 neck might provide both microdomain and multimerization specificity. In a protein-centric-model, the neck would function as the specificity determinant of the MPER multimerization motif, directing homotypic lower-order multimerization. Lipid recruitment by these p10 nanoclusters to generate a sterically favored lipid environment would then recruit additional monomers or lower-order multimers to create a fusion platform. In a lipidcentric model, the tetra-peptide p10 sorting signal functions primarily as a lipid recognition or adaptation motif. Neck residues could interact with specific lipid headgroups in the exoplasmic leaflet, similar to the reported cholesterol-binding activity of the conserved LWYIK juxtamembrane peptide of HIV gp41 [73] . Alternately, the neck may affect hydrophobic matching of the p10 TMD to acyl chain lengths of adjacent lipids. Recent molecular dynamic simulations and studies in artificial bilayers indicate cholesterol decreases the effects of hydrophobic mismatch by altering bilayer thickness and lipid packing, and by inducing changes in TMD helix length [71] . We note that the ARV and NBV p10 necks display very different arrangements of polar and non-polar residues ( Figure 1) ; ARV p10 has a polar-apolar-TMD arrangement while NBV p10 is apolar-polar-TMD. These different arrangements may influence cholesterol-mediated hydrophobic matching and lateral segregation of ARV and NBV p10 into distinct lipid microenvironments. The co-dependent and inseparable relationship between p10 multimerization and microdomain clustering makes it unclear, in either protein-or lipidcentric models, whether p10 associates with, or assembles, lipid rafts to promote multimerization.",

            "text": "Lastly, the readily reversible nature of p10 multimerization in the plasma membrane was an intriguing, and potentially functionally significant, observation. In contrast to the functionally reversible nature of p10 multimerization, enveloped fusogens are p10 Multifunctional Ectodomain locked in metastable dimeric or trimeric pre-fusion conformations that generally undergo an irreversible conformational conversion to a post-fusion, stable trimeric conformation, releasing energy to drive the fusion reaction [34, 36] . Thermodynamically favorable, reversible p10 multimerization implies fusion is not dependent on such energy releasing conformational changes. Furthermore, the co-dependence of multimerization and microdomain association suggests p10 may be capable of shuttling in and out of lipid rafts during the fusion reaction, similar to what occurs with the fusion machinery during peroxisome fusion [74] . Taken together with results indicating monomeric p10 still contains the essential cystine noose FP, this suggests there may be a role for reversible p10 multimerization during the fusion process. Interestingly, conformational changes of enveloped virus fusogens during transition from the pre-fusion structure to the post-fusion, trimeric hairpin conformation are impossible unless the ternary structure is dissociated [75] . Recent studies suggest that monomeric intermediates exist for both tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus E [76] and VSV G fusion proteins [77] . Monomeric intermediates and dynamic clustering and dispersion of protein fusogens at sites of fusion, either raft-mediated or otherwise, may therefore be a functionally relevant feature of viral fusogens.",

A fluorescently-labeled liposome population was similarly prepared to contain 2 mol% each of 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD-DOPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-4(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (Rho-DOPE). Non-labelled and labeled liposomes were incubated at 37uC in a 9:1 ratio at a concentration of 100 mM prior to addition of ARV or NBV p10 synthetic peptides dissolved in the same buffer as liposomes and added to the indicated final concentrations, or a buffer-only control. Fluorescence was recorded for up to ten minutes. The percent lipid mixing was calculated using equation (2):",

Images were captured at 1 min intervals to monitor the movement of fluorescently-tagged proteins. At t = 100 sec, 20 mM MbCD in HBSS was circulated into the cell chamber to chelate cholesterol. The diffusion of p10 proteins was followed for an additional 800 sec. Images were acquired using the Slidebook imaging software (Version 5.0). Additionally, QM5 cell monolayers transfected with FLAG-tagged ARV p10 were treated with 2, 5, 10 or 20 mM MbCD for 20 min, then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence staining for surfacelocalized proteins was performed as described above. Cholesterol repletion experiments were performed as previously described [48] on QM5 cell monolayers transfected with FLAG-tagged ARV p10 and c-myc-tagged NBV p10. Cholesterol-loaded MbCD was made by dissolving cholesterol (6 mg/ml) in serum-free medium containing 20 mM MbCD by vigorous vortexing and heating at 37uC for 30 min, then filtering to remove insoluble cholesterol.",

A Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM) 510 equipped with a META detector was used in wide field mode to detect sensitized emission FRET. Cells were imaged under a 1006 oil immersion, 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat objective. EGFP was excited using a 40 mW Argon laser at 488 nm, and mCherry was excited using a HeNe 548 nm laser. For microscope set-up and control experiments, additional transfections of free EGFP alone, free mCherry alone, free EGFP and free mCherry together, and EGFP directly linked to mCherry (EGFP-mCherry) were done concurrently. The donor and acceptor spectral bleed-through (SBT) values were visually minimized using the free EGFP and free mCherry samples, respectively, prior to detecting FRET in sample conditions. Donor and acceptor SBT ratios were modeled using exponential relationships with fluorophore intensity after exclusion of aberrant background values at low intensities and the application of a Gaussian blur. With the SBT values determined, the normalized FRET (NFRET) for the p10-p10 interaction was calculated. A series of three images was acquired for each cell imaged: (1) sensitized emission FRET image (donor excitation, acceptor emission; (2) donor image (donor excitation, donor emission); and (3) acceptor image (acceptor excitation, acceptor emission). Background subtraction and Gaussian blur of the donor, acceptor and FRET channels were performed on each image stack prior to analysis. Ten images were acquired for each sample condition in duplicate (total of twenty images). Using the PixFRET Image J plugin [51] , the FRET intensity of each pixel was normalized to the donor and acceptor expression levels by dividing the FRET-channel pixel intensity by the square-root of the product of the corresponding donor-and acceptor-channel pixels using equation (3) ",

Sequences of representative isolates of avian and pteropine p10 clades are shown, color coded to indicate the degree of conservation: red, absolutely conserved; blue, highly conserved; green, moderately conserved; black, not conserved. The diagram at the top depicts locations of motifs present in the ectodomain (HP, hydrophobic patch; CM, conserved motif) and endodomain (PB, polybasic) flanking the central transmembrane domain (TMD). The four conserved cysteine residues (C) are shown; the di-cysteine motif in the endodomain is palmitoylated while the two cysteines in the ectodomain form an intra-molecular di-sulfide bond. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004023.g001",

Co-transfectants included CM point substitutions (D31E and T35A), chimeric neck constructs (A5 and N5), and Ala substitutions of the tetra-peptide neck residues (A-neck and N-neck), as depicted inFigure 5. (B) As in panel A, except cells were co-transfected with ARV or NBV p10 and the ARV p10 C9S substitution, or with NBV p10 and the C9S substitution in an A5 background. Results are presented as mean 6 SEM (n = 3). (C) Co-transfections with varying ratios of functional NBV p10 (f) and non-functional ARV C9S with the A5 substitution. Data is presented as mean 6 SEM (n = 3). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004023.g006",

(A) Representative images of sensitized emission FRET, showing the donor and acceptor channels, and the calculated normalized FRET (NFRET) image. Control images were obtained from cells expressing EGFP directly linked to mCherry (GFP-mCh) or ARV p10-EGFP cotransfected with free mCherry (ARV-GFP+mCh) as negative FRET controls, or from cells coexpressing p14 FAST proteins linked to EGFP and mCherry as positive FRET controls for a known, multimeric membrane protein. Images acquired from cells co-expressing EGFP-and mCherry-tagged ARV p10 constructs (ARV-GFP+ARV-mCh) were used to detect ARV p10 multimerization.NFRET range is denoted by color gradations. Scale bars = 10 mm. (B) Fitted Gaussian distributions of twenty calculated NFRET images from two separate experiments were used to calculate the mNFRET (top) and mean pixel amplitude (bottom) from cells transfected or co-transfected with the indicated fluorescent probes. Boxes indicate mNFRET standard deviations, + denotes mean mNFRET, lines are the median mNFRET, and whiskers indicate min and max mNFRETs. Error bars in pixel amplitude panel represent standard error propagated within and across experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004023.g007",

(A) Cells co-expressing indicated EGFP and mCherry-tagged constructs with point substitutions in the CM (D31E or T35A), Ala substitutions of the neck tetra-peptide (A-neck or N-neck), and chimeric neck constructs (A5 or N5) were imaged to measure sensitized emission FRET. NFRET values are presented as in Figure 7. (B) Sensitized emission FRET of cells co-expressing EGFP-and mCherrytagged ARV p10 constructs were imaged after treatment with MbCD. Cells were similarly depleted of cholesterol using MbCD, then repleted using cholesterol-loaded MbCD before imaging.
