            "text": "2 Contributed equally to the results of this work Rat C-CAM is a ubiquitous, transmembrane and carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule. The human counterpart is known as biliary glycoprotein (BGP) or CD66a. It is involved in different cellular functions ranging from intercellular adhesion, microbial receptor activity, signaling and tumor suppression. In the present study N-glycosylation of C-CAM immunopurified from rat liver was analyzed in detail. The primary sequence of rat C-CAM contains 15 potential N-glycosylation sites. The N-glycans were enzymatically released from glycopeptides, fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzamide, and separated by two-dimensional HPLC. Oligosaccharide structures were characterized by enzymatic sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS. Mainly bi-and triantennary complex structures were identified. The presence of type I and type II chains in the antennae of these glycans results in heterogeneous glycosylation of C-CAM. Sialylation of the sugars was found to be unusual; bi-and triantennary glycans contained three and four sialic acid residues, respectively, and this linkage seemed to be restricted to the type I chain in the antennae. Approximately 20% of the detected sugars contain these unusual numbers of sialic acids. C-CAM is the first transmembrane protein found to be oversialylated.",

            "text": "C-CAM is regarded as a multifunctional molecule. Like other proteins of the Ig-superfamily, it mediates homophilic intercellular adhesion via its extracellular region, as shown in isolated hepatocytes (Odin et al., 1986; Becker et al., 1989; Becker et al., 1993; ) and transfected COS 7-, CHO-or insect cells (Lin et al., 1991; Lucka et al., 1995; Olsson et al., 1995) . In this process the first N-terminal Ig-like loop structure is the major adhesive component (Cheung et al., 1993) . Within this region three potential glycosylation sites exist. The intracellular part of C-CAM interacts with proteins involved in the signal transduction pathway, such as pp60c scr , the insulin receptor kinase, the protein kinase C, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (Brummer et al., 1995; Najjar et al., 1995; Beauchemin et al., 1997; Edlund et al., 1998) . Furthermore, interaction of both isoforms with calmodulin has been reported (Blikstad et al., 1992; Edlund and \u00d6brink, 1993; Edlund et al., 1996) . Most important, tumor suppression activity of C-CAM has been demonstrated in carcinoma cells from rat prostate, bladder, and colon (Hsieh et al., 1995; Kleinerman et al., 1996; Turbide et al., 1997) . In addition, C-CAM has been shown to bind bacteria and viruses (Leusch et al., 1991; Williams et al., 1991; Dveksler et al., 1993; Virji et al., 1996; Gray-Owen et al., 1997) , and its involvement in the binding and transport of bile salts from hepatocytes into the bile has been suggested (M\u00fcller et al., 1991; Sippel et al., 1993) .",

The primary sequence of rat C-CAM contains 15 potential N-glycosylation consensus sites (Lin and Guidotti, 1989) , but so far no detailed structural characterization of N-linked rat C-CAM glycan chains has been reported. Digestion with oligosaccharide-specific enzymes showed that rat liver C-CAM exists as numerous glycoforms. Desialylation reduced the M r from 110 k to \u223c90 k, while PNGaseF-treatment shifted the M r to \u223c50 k. EndoH had no effect, indicating the absence of high-mannose type oligosaccharides (Becker et al., 1993) . Characterization using lectin-agarose affinity chromatography indicated that the majority of glycans were of the complex-type (Bierhuizen et al., 1989) .",

Only 2,2,4 but no 2,2,6 linked triantennary sugars were detected. To specify the linkage of terminally bound galactose residues as well as the linkage of the subterminal N-acetylglucosamine to the trimannosyl core, glycan fractions obtained by RP-HPLC were digested with a mixture of \u03b21-4-galactosidase and \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidase. The reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and for some sugars by P4 gel permeation chromatography. Treatment of fraction F3 yielded two sugars with m/z values of 1786 (biantennary glycan) and 1421 (biantennary glycan minus a lactosamine unit). Thus two isomeric biantennary glycans eluted in fraction F3 carrying one or two units of GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal (type I chain) in the antennae (Table III, F3 .1 and F3.2). The main compound in fraction F4 was found to be a biantennary sugar with two antennae consisting of two GlcNAc\u03b21-4Gal (type II chain), but an isomer with one type I chain antenna was also detected. P4 gel permeation chromatography was used to determine the ratio of these fragments in fractions F3 and F4. The linkage of the type I and II chain antennae to the 3-or 6-linked mannose in the core of the oligosaccharide was not examined. Two fucosylated biantennary structures carrying one or two type II chains were found for sugars eluted in F5 and F6.2. Mass spectrometry of the digested fractions F7, F8, F9, and F10 resulted in ions which could be interpreted as isomers of triantennary sugars. A signal at m/z 1786 detected for fraction F7 revealed a loss of one lactosamine unit consistent with a 2,2,4 branched-triantennary sugar with two type I chains in the antennae. The main fraction, F8, yielded a signal at m/z 1421; this indicates the loss of two lactosamine units from a triantennary glycan carrying one GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal antenna which is 1-4-linked to mannose. Two digestion products were detected for fraction F9. The signal of m/z 1421 (F9.1) was again consistent with a fragment generated from a digested 2,2,4 branched-triantennary sugar with two type II sugar chains. A second isomer carrying three type II chains was deduced from the m/z value of 1259 recorded for fraction 9.2. The ratio of these fragments was determined by P4 gel permeation chromatography.

Since fraction AO coeluted with the injection peak, the ratio of sugars was quantified after rechromatography using NH 2 -HPLC. For further characterization the oligosaccharide-fractions A1-A4 were desialylated and rechromatographed by NH 2 -HPLC. Comparison of the glycan pattern of the total oligosaccharide moiety with the glycan pattern of the desialylated sugars of fractions A0, A1, A2, A3.1, A3.2, and A4 was used for structure assignment of the acidic fractions ( Figure 3 ). The identification of the chromatographic pattern was supported by mass spectrometric data for each desialylated glycan fraction (data not shown). Analysis of the total glycan population after desialylation revealed the presence of two isomers in several of the fractions, including the main fractions F3, F4, and F9.

As we did not find any undergalactosylated N-glycans, occurrence of incomplete structures may be explained by degradation due to preparation of glycopeptides by extensive pronase digestion, desialylation by acid hydrolysis and 14 C-labeling. Moreover, in contrast to our analysis, Bierhuizen et al. detected \u03b1(1-3)-linked fucose bound to GlcNAc of Gal\u03b21,4GlcNAc1-of the outer chain. Detection of \u03b1(1-3)-linked fucose and a high portion of oligomannose structures may reflect the limitations of using lectin-binding studies for structural analysis of oligosaccharides.",

Differences in the extent of sialylation of 19 main structures result in 39 N-glycan structures, of which 36 N-glycans contain one or more sialic acids. The most important result is that 28% of total N-glycans contain more sialic acid residues than antennae. About 38% of all biantennary structures are trisialylated, while 38% of all triantennary glycans appear to be tetrasialylated. The high content of sialic acids is responsible for the very acidic isoelectric point of 2.5-3.5 of C-CAM, as shown by the shift of its pI to 5.0-6.0 after desialylation (Becker et al., 1993) .",

In all cases, oversialylation was due exclusively to the presence of \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid bound to GlcNAc in NeuAc-\u03b12,3Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc-antennae (type I-chains). This corresponds to our finding, that oversialylated bi-and triantennary N-glycans contained at least one type I-chain and at least one \u03b12,3-bound sialic acid as shown by digestion with specific sialidases. Although occurrence of both \u03b12,6and \u03b12,3-sialylation has been clearly demonstrated, in lectin binding experiments only \u03b12,6-bound N-acetylneuraminic acid could be detected in C-CAM using SNA and MAA, respectively.

After extended stringent washing with buffer containing high concentrations of salt and detergent, bound C-CAM was eluted with 50 mM diethylamine, pH 11.5. Quality was monitored by SDS-PAGE, silver staining and Western blotting according to standard procedures.",
