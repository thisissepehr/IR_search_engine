However, these two techniques work via different mechanisms. NIV applies end-expiratory positive airway pressure (PEEP) and pressure support (PS). Optimally, PEEP increases functional residual capacity and opens collapsed alveoli, thereby improving ventilation-perfusion matching and reducing intrapulmonary shunt, as well as improving lung compliance, thus reducing respiratory load. The latter assists respiratory muscles during inspiration, reducing work of breathing and dyspnea. In contrast, HFNC only generates a small positive pressure spike at end-expiration that depends on the nasal airflow and the extent of mouth opening. HFNC appears to improve oxygenation primarily by flushing the nasal airspaces, reducing anatomical dead space. In addition, by delivering warm, well-humidified gas through the nostrils and avoiding the discomfort generated by the pressure that NIV masks exert on the facial skin, HFNC is tolerated much better than NIV and can be applied continuously for long periods of time [17] . The major goal of NIV and HFNC in treating ARDS is to achieve a sufficient oxygenation to avoid endotracheal intubation. However, NIV and HFNC are only \"partially support\" therapies. They do not address the underlying pathology of ARDS sufficiently, such as the ventilation-perfusion matching caused by atelectasis or consolidation in the dependent areas when supported with HFNC [18] . High-level PS in combination with deep inspiratory efforts could generate high tidal volumes and excessive trans-pulmonary pressures, increasing lung stress and contributing to VILI, maybe a risk for NIV failure [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1121, "end": 1125, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1512, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1731, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this regard, combining PP with these non-invasive respiratory supports in ARDS may result in better physiological effects on ventilation-perfusion mismatch, a better drainage for purulent lung infection-induced ARDS, and greater homogeneity in ARDS mechanics while receiving positive pressure support.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Based on these potential beneficial mechanisms, we performed a prospective observational study to test the hypothesis that early use of PP combined with either NIV or HFNC can avoid the need for intubation in moderate to severe ARDS patients.
