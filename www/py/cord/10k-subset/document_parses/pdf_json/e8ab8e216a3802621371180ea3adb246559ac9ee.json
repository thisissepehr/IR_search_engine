Yet, there are reflexes that require a more precise evaluation in order to be useful. Such is the case for the automated pupillary response to light, which can be done with extraordinary accuracy using pupillometry devices. Cerebral hemodynamics, most commonly represented by cerebral blood flow (CBF), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), can now be evaluated with a good level of reliability using brain ultrasound. Cerebral function can be evaluated using electrophysiological monitoring, which has become easily applicable also by neurointensivists, in part due to the development of more user-friendly devices.

Measurements of its diameter should be taken 3 mm from the globe perpendicularly (as shown in Fig. 7) , using an electronic caliper.

Many studies have supported the interpretation of the pulsatility index as a tool to reflect distal cerebrovascular resistances, attributing a higher pulsatility index to higher cerebrovascular resistances [26] . However, the pulsatility index is not dependent solely on cerebrovascular resistances, but its value is the result of an interplay between cerebrovascular resistances, CPP, and compliance of the arterial bed.

Technological evolution has developed a variety of Fig. 9 Reverberating flow in a patient with severe brain injury who developed an isoelectric encephalogram trace minutes after this recording and was confirmed brain dead a few hours later (simplified) EEG-derived indices that can be used to make this information more available. Use of processed EEG indices has been shown to improve intraoperative anesthetic titration during anesthesia but also sedation in the ICU: bispectral index [BIS, Medtronic, Boulder, CO), E-Entropy (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland), Narcotrend (Narcotrend Gruppe, Hannover, Germany), Masimo SEDLine (SEDline, Masimo Corp, Irvine, CA), and NeuroSENSE (NeuroWave Systems, Inc., Cleveland Heights, OH) are a few examples of the tools now available on the market (Fig. 10 ). There is as yet no evidence for superiority of one device over the others and differences in trace visualization, shape and characteristics of the sensor, institutional habits, and budgets are the main reasons for operator choice [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 590, "end": 594, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1702, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 717, "end": 723, "text": "Fig. 9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1464, "text": "(Fig. 10", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Processed Electroencephalography"}, {"text": "A detailed description of the EEG signal recording and processing is beyond the aim of this chapter, and the reader is referred to dedicated articles [36] . Briefly, subcortical regions (e.g., the thalamus) produce small potentials that cannot be identified from electrodes placed on the scalp because an electric field decreases in strength by the square of the distance from its source (Fig. 11) . However, because of the close and continuous interconnection between superficial and deep brain structures, surface EEG reflects the states of both cortical and subcortical areas. Dedicated monitors that automatically elaborate the frontal EEG trace are needed because a full-montage EEG during sedation requires cumbersome equipment and specialized training, not available to all intensivists. Moreover, a frontal processed EEG trace is considered reliable for the purposes of anesthesia/sedation monitoring even if some clinical conditions (see later) eventually require some knowledge of basic EEG principles. Processed EEG monitors deliver three main pieces of information: (1) the raw trace, (2) the numerical index of anesthesia/sedation depth, and (3) the 2D spectrogram (Fig. 12) . The reader is referred to dedicated articles for details about the specific parameters [37] . Processed EEG was originally intended for the management of the anesthetic state during surgery to avoid accidental awareness and to titrate sedation in critically ill patients where clinical scales represent the gold standard. The inclusion of processed EEG into many multiparametric ICU monitors reflects the perceived need for ICU caregivers to use a comprehensive approach in the management of sedated patients. Deep sedation is clearly associated with poor short-and long-term outcomes in critically ill patients: prolonged mechanical ventilation and cognitive and psychological complications all increase hospital and ICU length of stay and mortality [38] . Although light sedation, with patients being able to communicate and cooperate at any time, represents a modern target of sedation and a standard of care in ICUs, moderate-to-deep sedation (e.g., a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale [RASS] \u22643) may be needed in a nonnegligible number of patients, including those with alcohol weaning syndromes complicated by uncontrolled agitation; complex ventilator-patient desynchrony; refractory status epilepticus; intracranial hypertension; patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents; postsurgical patients requiring hemodynamic, temperature, or bleeding stabilization; post-cardiac arrest therapy (post-resuscitation care); or TBI. In these categories of patients, clinical scales (e.g., RASS, Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale [SAS]), unless they represent standardized assessment of sedation levels, cannot be applied. Moreover, they are commonly evaluated every 4-6 h, and may not detect periods of inadequate sedation occurring between assessments, whereas processed EEG is a continuous method of analysis. In addition, clinical scale assessment is performed by disturbing sedated or sleeping patients (processed EEG does not require modification of the sedation state) and can never identify phases of burst suppression or isoelectric traces (total suppression) [39] , which are associated with negative outcomes (e.g., delirium occurrence, prolonged mechanical ventilation, mortality). In this context, in a post hoc analysis of a prospective observational study performed in 125 ICU patients under mechanical ventilation, burst suppression occurred in 39% of the cases and was an independent predictor of increased risk of death at 6 months [40] . Processed EEG values can vary greatly in patients sedated in the ICU because, unlike those undergoing painful surgery, patients in the ICU may not experience strong stimulation and therefore require relatively low levels of sedation, appearing calm with BIS values of around 60-80. Clinical procedures, spontaneous patient arousal, physiological sleep cycles, noise, and nursing activities may cause sedation levels to fluctuate. What is important to consider is that muscle activity (mainly) and electric devices (less frequently) may interfere with the ability of the system to process the raw trace, leading to falsely increased sedation indexes [41] . In order to limit this sort of artifact the companies are improving their devices keeping them more \"resistant\" to EMG interference.

Using processed EEG systems as an objective guide for sedative dosing in critically ill patients can decrease the medical complications of oversedation, such as depressed cardiac contractility and hypotension. There are few studies on processed EEG monitoring in the ICU. The first was a prospective trial that randomized patient sedation to be assessed using the Ramsay Scale or BIS monitoring during propofol sedation that was stopped every 2 h [44] . A nurse-guided Ramsey score of 4 was the target in controls, and a BIS value of 70-80 was the target for the study group. A reduction in propofol of 50% was obtained in the BIS group versus controls. The second study [45] was a prospective randomized trial in which patients sedated with morphine and midazolam were randomized to sedation titration based on a BIS >0 versus clinical assessment. No difference was found in the total amount of administered sedative drugs, length of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay. In a recent study on 110 trauma patients, use of BIS resulted in a decrease in sedation and analgesia use, decrease in agitation, less failure to extubate, and fewer tracheostomies, with an approximate 4-day decreased length of stay [46] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 629, "end": 633, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1087, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1311, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1855, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recommendations from International Guidelines"}, {"text": "Beyond its use for sedative titration purposes, processed EEG may have some additional applications in ICU patients, including identification of subclinical/ unrecognized seizures or seizures occurring when neuromuscular blocking agents are administered.
