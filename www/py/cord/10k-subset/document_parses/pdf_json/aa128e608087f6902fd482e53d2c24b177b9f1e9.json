Pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors (pan-HDACis) have recently been presented in the literature as powerful novel antimalarials, although their application is hampered due to toxic side effects. This drawback might be neutralized by the deployment of isoformselective HDACis. Results: In this study, 42 thiaheterocyclic benzohydroxamic acids, 17 of them being potent and selective hHDAC6 inhibitors, were tested to investigate a possible correlation between hHDAC6 inhibition and antiplasmodial activity. Conclusion: Four hHDAC6 inhibitors showed submicromolar potency against both a chloroquine-sensitive and a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum with high selectivity indices, pointing to the relevance of exploring hHDAC6 inhibitors as potential new antiplasmodial agents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Malaria is a devastating parasitic disease, exemplified by the fact that roughly 3.2 billion people are at risk of contracting malaria and that this disease caused roughly 438,000 deaths in 2015, with an estimated 306,000 casualties in the group of children under the age of five (WHO) [1] . The main culprit causing this infection is the protozoan spe-cies Plasmodium falciparum, transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles [2] . In the past 15 years (2000-2015) , considerable progress has been made toward revoking this infection, as illustrated by a declining number of malaria cases and deaths ( For reprint orders, please contact reprints@future-science.com victims even further and to find solutions to address all challenges associated with this disease. A pertinent challenge relates to the expanding resistance of the Plasmodium parasite toward several treatment regimes. Indeed, resistance has emerged with respect to the standard antimalarials chloroquine (CQ), sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine and, more recently, artemisinin [3] . The acquired artemisinin resistance is particularly alarming, since artemisinin combination therapies represent the first-in-line treatment option for malaria nowadays. A consequence of this recurring resistance is the urgent need to develop new medicines with alternative mechanisms of action, in order to impede or deter the parasite from developing resistance by applying combination therapies. In that regard, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) might offer new treatment opportunities, as several known HDAC inhibitors have recently been shown to demonstrate a promising activity against P. falciparum and other malarial strains [4] [5] [6] [7] . HDACs and HATs function as regulators of lysine acetylation, an important post-translational modification responsible for the neutralization of the positive charges on lysine residues, and as such adjusting the exact mode of action of the targeted protein [8] . HDACs were first been discovered as histone lysine modifying enzymes but are now generally accepted to be lysine deacetylases, also deacetylating several nonhistone proteins [9] . In humans, this group of enzymes comprises four classes, with class I (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8), IIa (HDAC4, 5, 7 and 9), IIb (HDAC6 and 10) and IV (HDAC11) employing zinc as an essential cofactor, while class III (SIRT1-7) uses NAD + for its deacetylase activity [10] . On the other hand, five HDAC isoforms are known for P. falciparum: Pf H-DAC1, with homology to human class I, Pf HDAC2 and 3, with homology to human class II, and Pf Sir2A and Pf Sir2B, with homology to human class III [11] . So far, mainly pan-HDACis have been tested for their activity against P. falciparum, revealing high toxicities in the (low) nanomolar range toward the malaria parasite [4] [5] [6] [7] . A major drawback associated with these broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors involves the interaction with all human Zn 2+ -dependent HDACs, culminating in a higher risk to elicit toxic side effects upon administration. Therefore, the selective inhibition of pf HDACs over hHDAC isoforms represents a relevant challenge in antimalarial drug discovery and has led to the assessment of many hHDAC inhibitors as potential antiplasmodial agents. In that respect, a library screen of 2000 compounds has revealed (E)-7-[2-(2-bromobenzylidene)hydrazinyl]-N-hydroxy-7-oxoheptanamide to be such a selective compound and, in another report, a specific class of methylamides has been shown to be pf HDAC selective [12, 13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 430, "end": 433, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 448, "end": 468, "text": "15 years (2000-2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 604, "end": 605, "text": "(", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1041, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1685, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1689, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1690, "end": 1693, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1697, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1959, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2139, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2404, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2626, "end": 2630, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2801, "end": 2804, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2805, "end": 2808, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2809, "end": 2812, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2816, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3515, "end": 3519, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3520, "end": 3523, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "An alternative strategy could imply the examination of selective hHDAC inhibitors (instead of pan-hHDAC inhibitors) as novel antimalarial compounds.

Class 1 consists of molecules containing a saturated thiaheterocyclic ring annulated onto an indole core (designated as Tubathians), class 2 comprises benzothiophenes embodying a nitrogen atom in the linker region and class 3 includes cycloalkane-annulated 1,5-benzothiazepine scaffolds. Because of small structural modifications with respect to the 'mother structure' within each class (Figure 1  & Table 1 ), a broad set of 42 compounds with divergent decoration patterns is synthetically available. The preparation of these compounds 1-3 has previously been described, together with a detailed account on their HDAC6 selectivity, cellular activity (\u03b1-tubulin acetylation, a known substrate of HDAC6) and mutagenicity [20] [21] [22] [23] . For Tubathian structures 1, additional information concerning the ADME/Tox properties has been disclosed as well [22] . These different classes include a number of highly potent and selective hHDAC6 inhibitors (Table 2) , which have in common a para-substituted benzohydroxamic acid fragment, no substituents in the meta-position with respect to the hydroxamic acid group, and superior HDAC6 inhibitory activity for sulfoxides and sulfones over the c orresponding sulfides. The antiplasmodial activity of this set of structures was first determined through a modified parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay against a CQ-sensitive (CQS) The para- and meta-configuration for compound 1 refers to the position of the hydroxamic acid group on the aromatic ring with respect to the aminomethyl substituent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 918, "end": 922, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 923, "end": 927, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 928, "end": 932, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 933, "end": 937, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1057, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 194, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 585, "end": 605, "text": "(Figure 1  & Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1159, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Results & discussion"}, {"text": "Exploration of thiaheterocyclic hHDAC6 inhibitors as potential antiplasmodial agents Short Communication [16, 17] . When the molecules proved to be reasonably active against this strain (IC 50 <5 \u03bcM), a second assay was performed against a CQ-resistant (CQR) strain of P. falciparum (Dd2), as well as an MTT-assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) on CHO cells to assess their mammalian cytotoxicity (Table 2 ) [18] . Finally, a selectivity index (SI = IC 50 CHO/IC 50 NF54) and a resistance index (RI = IC 50 Dd2/IC 50 NF54) was calculated to be able to easily compare the therapeutic window (active concentration vs toxic concentration) and sensitivity toward resistance developing. Table 2 shows that all 42 benzohydroxamic acids 1-3 display interesting antiplasmodial activities (IC 50 values against the CQS strain between 0.11 and 37.5 \u03bcM). The potent HDAC6 inhibitors 1i, 1k, 1l, 3d, 3e and 3f were also found to be highly active against both CQS and CQR parasitic strains (IC 50 CQS and CQR < 1 \u03bcM, IC 50 HDAC6 < 0.07 \u03bcM). However, other active HDAC6 inhibitors did not demonstrate a distinct submicromolar parasitic toxicity (e.g., 1a, 1e and 1g). Thus, no consistent correlation can be drawn between hHDAC6 inhibition and antiplasmodial activity, which could be expected considering the inevitable differences between human and parasite HDAC isoforms [11] . On the other hand, it is remarkable to note that the most effective antiplasmodial compounds all are powerful hHDAC6 inhibitors, and none of the less active hHDAC6 inhibitors showed submicromolar antiplasmodial potency. Based on these observations, it can be suggested that strong hHDAC6 inhibitory activity is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for thiaheterocyclic benzohydroxamic acids to exert submicromolar antiplasmodial activity as well. From the six compounds showing the most promising antiplasmodial activity, four molecules have excellent selectivity indices higher than 300 (1i, 1k, 1l and 3d), which means that the concentration at which they kill the parasite is at least 300-times lower than their toxic concentration for CHO cells. Compari-son of the resistance indices (RI) suggests that the tested molecules have comparable activity (RI = 0.3-3.9) against both strains (CQS and CQR). This is in marked contrast to the control drug CQ, which is 17-times less active against the CQR strain (RI = 17.5).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 109, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 110, "end": 113, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 440, "end": 444, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1394, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 429, "end": 437, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 714, "end": 721, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "future science group"}, {"text": "Conclusion 42 thiaheterocyclic benzohydroxamic acids 1-3, 17 of them previously being identified as highly potent and selective hHDAC6 inhibitors, were assessed in terms of their antiplasmodial profile.

On the other hand, hydroxamic acids which do not strongly inhibit hHDAC6, appear to possess only moderate antiplasmodial effects. Thus, potent and selective hHDAC6 inhibitory activity of thiaheterocyclic benzohydroxamic acids seems to be a necessary but not a sufficient condition to elicit pronounced antiplasmodial activity as well. Moreover, selective hHDAC6 inhibitors can induce powerful P. falciparum toxicity without being toxic for CHO cells (as a model for mammalian cytotoxicity).
