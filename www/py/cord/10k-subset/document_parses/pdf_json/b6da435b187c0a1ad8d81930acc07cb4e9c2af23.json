            "text": "Our previous studies have shown that the transmembrane domain of bovine GalT plays a critical role in Golgi localization (Teasdale,R.D., D'Agostaro,G. and Gleeson,P.A.,/. Biol. Chem., 267, 4084-4096, 1992). Here we have compared the localization and post-translational modifications of fulllength bovine GalT with a GalT/hybrid molecule where the transmembrane domain of GalT was replaced with that of the transferrin receptor. GalT/hybrid molecules were expressed on the surface of transfected cells; however, differences were observed in the distribution of the hybrid molecules between transfected COS and murine L cells. In transfected COS cells, the GalT/hybrid protein was expressed efficiently at the cell surface, with little Golgilocalized material, whereas in stable murine L cells, which expressed lower levels of the construct, hybrid molecules were detected both at the cell surface and within the Golgi apparatus. Expression of the GalT constructs in either COS or L cells produced two glycoprotein products which differed in molecular mass by 7 kDa. The difference in size between the two products is due to post-translational modifications which are inhibited by brefeldin A and are therefore likely to occur in the frans-Golgi network (TGN). Very little of the high-molecular-weight species was detected for full-length GalT, whereas it was a major product for the GalT/hybrid protein. Only the higher molecular weight species was expressed at the cell surface. Thus, this additional 7 kDa post-translational modification distinguishes molecules retained within the Golgi apparatus (lower M r species) from those transported through the TGN to the cell surface. These studies indicate that (i) the level of expression influences the intracellular distribution of GalT/ hybrid molecules and (ii) the localization of full-length GalT involves active retention within the Golgi stack, and not retrieval from later compartments. After treatment of membrane preparations from stable L cell clones with a heterobifunctional cross-linking agent, full-length bovine GalT molecules were found almost exclusively as high-molecular-weight aggregates, suggesting that GalT exists as an oligomer or aggregate. This ability to oligomerize may be a requirement for Golgi retention.",

The transport of proteins through the Golgi compartments is mediated by transport vesicles and involves complex budding and fusion events (Pryer et ai, 1992; Rothman and Orci, 1992; Sztul et ai, 1992; Rothman and Warren, 1994) . Proteins destined for the cell surface are considered to be transported by a default pathway through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface without requiring a specific transport signal (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . On the other hand, proteins resident in the Golgi apparatus must have a positive signal to ensure they are targeted to the correct Golgi compartment and kept from being swept further along the biosynthetic pathway.",

In addition to a trans-Golgi localization, GalT has also been detected on the cell surface of a number of different cell types by immunocytochemistry (Shur, 1982 (Shur, , 1991 Shaper et ai, 1985; Suganuma et ai, 1991; Taatjes et ai, 1992) , although in most cases confirmation by biochemical studies has not been carried out. Surface GalT has been implicated as a receptor for terminal A / -acetylglucosamine residues of glycoconjugates in a variety of cell-cell interactions, such as sperm-egg binding (Miller et ai, 1992) and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (Begovac etai, 1991; Barcellos-Hoff, 1992) .

This has been demonstrated by the ability of the transmembrane domain of GalT to efficiently localize hybrid proteins to the Golgi apparatus. However, the precise structural features of the transmembrane domain of GalT required for Golgi retention have not been defined. Also, it is not known if sequences outside the transmembrane domain of GalT contribute to the retention of the native enzyme, as appears to be the case for other glycosyltransferases (Munro, 1991; Dahdal and Colley, 1993; Burke et ai, 1994) .",

Indeed, we have recently proposed that glycosyltransferase hybrid molecules are targeted to the Golgi apparatus by a mechanism that is saturable (Burke et al, 1994) . Evidence is emerging that Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases may involve aggregation (Nilsson et al, 1994) and we have proposed that hybrid molecules are retained within the Golgi by their ability to dock with endogenous aggregates within Golgi membranes (Burke et al, 1994) .",

Here we have extended this finding and shown that membrane-bound GalT molecules at the cell surface also carry an additional modification compared with Golgi-localized GalT.

In addition, a 918 secreted truncated form of GalT [GalT(-T,-S/A), where S/A is signal-anchor domain], which lacked the cytoplasmic and signal/anchor domains and contained a classical signal sequence at the N-terminus, carried additional post-translational modifications compared to the membrane-bound full-length GalT (Teasdale et al, 1992) .

Cell lysates were incubated with antibodies specific to bovine GalT, and immunoprecipitates examined by fluorography following SDS-PAGE. Full-length GalT and GalT/TfR(s/A) hybrid molecules were identified as 50 kDa components after a 30 min pulse (Figure la) . As the predicted polypeptide mass of the GalT products is 45 kDa (D'Agostaro et al, 1989) , a molecular mass of 50 kDa indicates a glycosylated product. After a 1 h chase, the 50 kDa species was the major component of the full-length bovine GalT, although a minor, higher molecular weight, product of 57 kDa was also observed (Figure la), consistent with previous observations (Teasdale et al, 1992) . Components of similar size were also specifically immunoprecipitated from GalT/ TfR(s/A) transfected cells after 1 h chase; however, the higher molecular weight component of 57 kDa represented the dominant species. This result indicates that in contrast to fulllength GalT, the GalT hybrid molecules are rapidly converted from the 50 kDa component to the higher molecular weight component of 57 kDa.",

To determine if the 1 h chase period represented a steady-state distribution, the proportion of the two membrane-bound products was assessed by immunoblotting extracts of transfected COS cells using the affinity-purified anti-GalT antibodies. COS cell extracts were analysed by immunoblotting 48 h posttransfection; immunofluorescence data at this time point indicated that the majority of full-length GalT is Golgi localized, whereas GalT/TfR(s/A) appears to be expressed predominantly on the cell surface ( Figure 4 ). Two components of 50 and 57 kDa were detected for both constructs (Figure lb) . A minor 50 kDa component was also detected in cell extracts from untransfected cells; however, the intensity of this band was considerably less than from extracts of transfected cells. The 50 kDa species was the major component for the full-length bovine GalT, whereas the GalT/TfR(s/A) product was present as both the lower (50 kDa) and higher (57 kDa) M r species. Further, the ratio of the 50 and 57 kDa components detected by immunoblotting is similar to that observed in the pulse-chase experiments. Treatment of transfected COS cells with cycloheximide for periods up to 8 h, prior to immunoblotting, did not result in a marked change in the ratio of the two products for either full-length GalT or GalT/TfR(s/A) (not shown); however, the yields of both products decreased markedly over the 8 h treatment period, again consistent with a high rate of intracellular turnover of GalT in the transfected COS cells.",

Bovine GalT has two potential A'-glycosylation sites and both sites probably carry N-glycans on the native bovine protein (D'Agostaro et al, 1989) ; in addition, native bovine GalT has also been shown to carry O-glycans (Trayer and Hill, 1971; Lehman et al, 1975) . Transfected COS cells were labelled for 30 min, chased for 1 h and the GalT molecules immunoprecipitated. The radiolabelled immunoprecipitates were treated with either peptide: A'-glycosidase F (N-glycanase), endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or sialidase. GalT products were found to be /V-glycosylated, indicating that both full-length and GalT/-TfR(s/A) adopt a type II membrane orientation in transfected COS cells (Figure lc). Treatment with N-glycanase collapsed the 50 kDa species of GalT and GalT/TfR(s/A) into products of 43-45 kDa, the expected size of the polypeptide, whereas the higher 57 kDa species appeared to collapse into a product of -53 kDa [Figure lc; in particular see GalT/TfR(s/A)]. The intermediate component of 50 kDa may represent incompletely digested material or A'-glycanase-resistant glycoprotein. The secreted GalT(-T,-S/A) product of 52 kDa was also susceptible to A/-glycanase digestion, and was converted to a 46 kDa component. A molecular mass of 46 kDa is larger than the expected 40 kDa for the GalT(-T,-S/A) polypeptide and again indicates the presence of either A'-glycanase-resistant material or additional post-translational modifications.",

Indeed, these transfected cells are estimated to express an ~ 100-fold increase in GalT activity (Teasdale et al, 1992) . The elevated levels of GalT activity within the secretory pathway may result in extensive galactosylation of GlcNAc-(Man 5 )GlcNAc 2 -Asn or GlcNAc(Man 3 )GlcNAc 2 -Asn oligosaccharides (where GlcNAc is A'-acetylglucosamine and Man is mannose), and as galactosylated GlcNAc(Man 5 ) GlcNAc 2 -Asn or GlcNAc(Man 3 )GlcNAc 2 -Asn structures are not acceptors for either a-mannosidase II or GlcNAc transferase II (Schachter, 1986) , respectively, this would result in the diversion of the A'-glycan synthesis pathway to hybrid structures.",

Brefeldin A is known to perturb the stacked cisternae of the Golgi apparatus in a different manner to the TGN, preventing exposure of newly synthesized glycoproteins to the TGN (see review by Klausner et al., 1992) . GalT and GalT/TfR(s/A) transfected COS cells were pulsed for 30 min and chased for 1 h in the presence of brefeldin A. Both products were immunoprecipitated from the brefeldin A-treated transfected cells as single components of -51 kDa ( Figure 3 ). Significantly, the higher molecular weight component was not detected in these brefeldin A-treated cells. However, in both cases the single product from the brefeldin A-treated cells was slightly larger (-2 kDa) than the lower molecular weight species from the untreated cells. Surprisingly, these products were sensitive to sialidase; after removal of sialic acid, the products were the same size as the nonsialylated lower molecular weight components from untreated cells. Bovine GalT contains both N-and 0-glycans (Trayer and Hill, 1971; Lehman etal, 1975) and, notably, sialylation of the O-glycans of human GalT in brefeldin A-treated HeLa cells has been noted previously (Bosshart et al., 1991) . Solubilized cell extracts were incubated with affinity-purified anti-GalT antibodies as described in Materials and methods. The isolated immune complexes were treated with AZ-glycanase, or sialidase as indicated, and the digests were analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. The arrows indicate the relative positions for the higher and lower molecular weight species of GalT products. The asterisk at 43 kDa indicates a non-specific band present in the pre-immune precipitate.",

The level of expression of constructs in stable L cells is considerably lower than in transfected COS cells and more closely resembles that of the endogenous enzyme. Thus, the effect of different expression levels of GalT on localization and post-translational processing could also be assessed. Murine L cells were transfected with either full-length bovine GalT or GalT/TfR(s/A) and stable transfected cell lines obtained by selection with mycophenolic acid. A number of clonal populations were isolated from each transfected cell line whu \u2022 were screened for expression of GalT products by indirect immunofluorescence using the anti-GalT antibodies. All the isolated clones showed a 2-to 4-fold increase in GalT activity as compared with untransfected cells. This represents only a modest increase over endogenous levels of GalT and is -50-fold lower activity than in transfected COS cells expressing GalT. We have previously shown that full-length GalT adopts a type II membrane orientation in transfected L cells and appears to be exclusively the long form of GalT (Teasdale et al., 1992) . As the GalT/TfR hybrid protein is catalytically active in stable L cells, and as these hybrid molecules are also A'-glycosylated (not shown), they must also adopt the correct type II orientation. The localization of the GalT proteins in the stable L cell clones was determined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry using affinity-purified anti-bovine GalT antibodies. Stable clones expressing full-length GalT showed a strong perinuclear staining pattern, indicative of the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 4) . The GalT/TfR(s/A) transfected L cells showed a diffuse, homogeneous staining overlying the whole cell which is consistent with surface staining; however, this surface staining was not as evident as in the transfected COS cells (Figure 4) . However, in contrast to transfected COS, stable L cell clones expressing the GalT/TfR(s/A) molecule also showed strong perinuclear staining. A number of L cell clones of each construct were analysed and all showed a similar staining pattern. To confirm that the perinuclear staining observed in the GalT-expressing cells represented Golgi localization, the transfected cells were treated, prior to immunofluorescence, with nocodazole and brefeldin A, drugs known to affect Golgi morphology. Treatment with nocodazole resulted in the disappearance of the perinuclear staining pattern and replacement by a vesicular staining dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Treatment with brefeldin A resulted in a diffuse reticular staining of the cytoplasm, typical of the ER ( Figure 5 ). These results are typical of membrane proteins localized to the Golgi stack and indicate that a considerable proportion of the GalT hybrid molecules is localized to the Golgi apparatus.",

Therefore, low levels of full-length GalT are expressed at the surface of transfected cells, consistent with our previous findings (Teasdale et al., 1992) . In contrast, GalT/TfR(s/A) expressing cells show strong surface staining, with a peak surface fluorescence 19 times greater than untransfected cells.

However, the immunofluorescent data suggest that substantial material is also localized to the Golgi apparatus. This Golgi-localized material may represent either actively retained protein molecules or, alternatively, it may represent molecules in transit through the Golgi apparatus on their way to the cell surface. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cells were treated with 100 p.g/ml cycloheximide for 4 h, to inhibit protein synthesis, prior to immunofluorescence. No apparent reduction in perinuclear staining was observed with either GalT-or GalT/TfR(s/A)-expressing cells after the cycloheximide treatment ( Figure 5 ). As a control, L cells expressing the cell surface antigen, PC-1, were also analysed (Belli et al., 1993) . Permeabilized stable L cells expressing PC-1 showed diffuse staining, as well as some additional staining within the perinuclear region. This perinuclear staining was no longer apparent following a 4 h cycloheximide treatment ( Figure 5 ). Thus, PC-1 molecules in transit in the Golgi apparatus are effectively chased out by this treatment. Stable L cells expressing another cell surface molecule, namely influenza haemagglutinin, show similar results to PC-1, in that after cycloheximide treatment no perinuclear staining was visible (Burke et al, 1994) . In addition, it should also be noted that the rate-limiting step in transport within the secretory pathway is usually from the ER, and not the Golgi apparatus (Pelham, 1989) . Therefore, these results indicate that the perinuclear staining pattern observed in L cells expressing GalT hybrid molecules represents material specifically retained within the Golgi apparatus.",

The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked overnight with 3% gelatin/PBS/0.5% Tween-20 and incubated with the affinity-purified anti-GalT antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. Bound peroxidase was detected by chemiluminescence and the resulting fluorograph shown. (B) Bovine GalT products were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts of transfected L cells expressing full-length GalT and the isolated immune complexes were treated with A'-glycanase, siahdase or Endo H, as indicated. The digested products were analysed by immunoblotting as above. 1 and 2) , and L cells transfected with GalT (lanes 3 and 4) and GalT/TfR(s/A) (lanes 5 and 6) were either surface labelled by biotinylation (lanes 2, 4 and 6) or mock treated (lanes 1, 3 and 5). Cell extracts were prepared and GalT products isolated by incubation with affinity-purified anti-GalT antibodies as described in Materials and methods. The immunoprecipitated products were separated on a reducing SDS/10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked overnight with PBS containing 1 M glucose, 10% glycerol, 3% fish gelatin and 0.05% Tween-20. The nitrocellulose was incubated either with streptavidinHRP (A) or with the affinity-purified anti-GalT antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (B). Bound peroxidase was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and the resulting fluorograph shown. The arrows indicate the relative positions for the higher and lower molecular weight GalT products. steady-state conditions strongly indicates that GalT molecules are actively retained within Golgi membranes rather than being continuously retrieved from post-Golgi compartments. intracellular forms of GalT. Surface-biotinylated cells were extracted with lysis buffer, and all GalT products immunoprecipitated with anti-GalT antibodies. One-half of the immunoprecipitate was then analysed by immunoblotting using streptavidin-peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence to detect biotinylated products, and the other half by immunoblotting using affinity-purified anti-GalT antibodies. Only the 63 kDa component was detected as a biotinylated GalT product in L cells expressing GalT/TfR(s/A) hybrid molecules ( Figure  8 ). Although not detected by immunoblotting of total extracts, low levels of a biotinylated 63 kDa mol. wt species were also detected for full-length GalT (Figure 8) , consistent with the presence of low levels of full-length GalT on the surface of transfected L cells, as detected by flow cytometry. The lower 55 kDa GalT component was not detected as a biotinyated species in either transfected L cell. This result indicates that the higher molecular weight species is selectively expressed at the cell surface, consistent with the proposal that GalT molecules which are not retained within Golgi membranes are transported to a compartment where additional post-translational modifications take place, prior to transport to the cell surface. On the other hand, these results also indicate that the lower 55 kDa component, bearing complex N-glycans, represents molecules actively retained within the Golgi apparatus.",

To address this possibility, the degree of aggregation of bovine GalT and GalT/TfR(s/A) hybrid molecules in stable L cells was assessed by cross-linking studies. Cross-linking experiments were carried out using total membrane preparations of stable L cells and the bifunctional, cleavable cross-linking agent, dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate) (DSP). The treated membrane samples were analysed by immunoblotting using the bovine-specific anti-GalT antibodies. After cross-linking, full-length bovine GalT was found almost exclusively as high-molecular-weight material, whereas the GalT/TfR(s/A) hybrid molecules were cross-linked to a lesser extent (Figure 9 ). Similar results were obtained with more than one clone of each construct. Cleavage of the crosslinking agent with the reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), collapsed the high-molecular-weight material to the expected size of the monomers, indicating that the immunoreactivity of the high-molecular-weight material is specific for GalT. Further, analysis of the cross-linked material by SDS-PAGE and silver staining showed that the bulk of the membrane proteins were not cross-linked, indicating that the susceptibility of GalT to cross-linking under these conditions is not a typical feature shared by the majority of other membrane proteins (not shown). This result indicates that the Golgi-localized full-length GalT is highly susceptible to cross-linking, consistent with an aggregated state.",

The general strategy employed in these studies has involved the construction of fusion proteins, containing domains of the glycosyltransferase, and the analysis of their localization within transfected mammalian cells. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy have predominantly been used to establish the cellular distribution of the expressed products in these studies. This approach has identified the transmembrane domains of GalT, a2,6 sialyltransferase and GlcNAc transferase I as a critical component in the localization of these resident Golgi proteins (see above references). However, it is now clear that the membraneflanking regions of a2,6 sialyltransferase and GlcNAc transferase I also play a role in Golgi localization (Munro, 1991; Burke et ai, 1992 Burke et ai, , 1994 Tang et ai, 1992; Dahdal and Colley, 1993) . For a more accurate assessment of the intracellular localization of hybrid proteins, it is important to be able to biochemically distinguish molecules which are localized to the Golgi apparatus from those which have been transported further along the biosynthetic pathway. Here we have characterized GalT products from transfected cells and shown that GalT products destined for the cell surface carry additional post-translational modifications compared with Golgi-retained GalT. The results presented in this paper show that the GalT product retained in the Golgi is the lower molecular weight species. If transported through the TGN, this lower molecular weight species is modified to the higher molecular weight species, and the resulting product is transported to the cell surface and not retrieved to the Golgi stack.",

In contrast, in stable L cells hybrid molecules were expressed at the cell surface and also partially retained within the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, the same construct expressed transiently in COS cells showed a different intracellular distribution to stable expression in mouse L cells. As the L cells express GalT at an ~50-fold lower level than COS cells, these results suggest that the level of expression of glycosyltransferase hybrid proteins could be an important factor in localization. Clearly, stable clones expressing low levels of the hybrid molecules are likely to be more informative. The localization of Gal/TfR(s/A) in transfected L cells shows that replacement of the signal/anchor domain of GalT with the corresponding domain of the transferrin receptor has only partially disrupted the Golgi retention of GalT and suggests that regions outside the hydrophobic transmembrane domain of GalT also contribute to Golgi localization, as is the case for a2,6 sialyltransferase and GlcNAc transferase I (Munro, 1991; Tang et ai, 1992; Dahdal and Colley, 1993; Burke et ai, 1994) .",

We conclude that the higher molecular weight species was a result of a modification of the lower molecular weight species in the TGN (Figure 10 ), for the following reasons. Firstly, pulse-chase studies showed that the higher molecular weight species was derived from the lower molecular weight species. Secondly, in COS cells only the higher molecular weight species was sialylated, a modification known to occur in the late Golgi. Thirdly, only the higher molecular weight species was expressed on the cell surface of transfected COS and L cells. Fourthly, brefeldin A blocks the synthesis of the higher molecular weight species. Brefeldin A is known to disassemble the Golgi stack in most cells and redistribute the Golgi enzymes into the ER (for reviews, see Pelham, 1991b; Klausner et ai, 1992) , whereas the TGN is not perturbed by brefeldin A in this manner and, thus, TGN marker proteins do not redistribute into this mixed ER/Golgi system (Chege and Pfeffer, 1990; Wood et ai, 1991; Reaves and Banting, 1992) . The block in the synthesis of the higher molecular weight product by brefeldin A indicates, therefore, that the responsible modification occurs in a compartment later than the trans-Golgi, most likely the TGN. The basis for the size difference between the two GalT products in transfected COS cells is due in part to sialylation; however, the modification in transfected L cells is not known.",

Whereas all membrane-bound GalT products in transfected COS cells were at least partially sensitive to Endo H, the mature GalT products from transfected L cells were Endo H resistant. Therefore, the processing of the N-glycans of bovine GalT differs between transfected COS and L cells. This may be a reflection on the different cell type or, alternatively, on the different levels of GalT activity in the transfected cells. For example, the higher GalT activity in transfected COS cells may be influencing the /V-glycan processing pathway by competing with GlcNAc transferase II and a-mannosidase II for common oligosaccharide substrates (Schachter, 1986) , thereby diverting the synthesis to Endo H-sensitive hybrid structures. In transfected COS cells, only the higher molecular weight GalT product was sialylated, whereas both GalT products were sialylated in stable L cells. This may be a reflection of the different sialyltransferases present in COS and L cells, and their specific localization within the Golgi apparatus. There are a number of sialyltransferases involved in the addition of sialic acid to N-and O-glycans (Beyer et al, 1981) . Significantly, cc2,6 sialyltransferase, which adds sialic acid residues to N-glycans, has been shown to be localized to the transcisternae and TGN (Roth et al, 1985; Taatjes et al, 1988) . However, the recent observation that the expression of rat oc2,6 sialyltransferase in COS cells leads to the appearance of new NeuAca2,6Gal-containing carbohydrate antigens (Bast et al, 1992) indicates that the level of endogenous a2,6 sialyltransferase activity may in fact be very low in COS cells. Clearly, more information is needed on the localization of other sialyltransferases, especially a2,3 sialyltransferase which also adds sialic acid residues to N-glycans (Weinstein et al, 1982) .",

Cells expressing GalT/TfR(s/A) accumulated significantly greater amounts of the high-molecular-weight product compared with full-length GalT, consistent with their differential location. As full-length GalT exists predominantly as the lower molecular weight species under steady-state conditions, the bulk of these Golgi-localized molecules are apparently inaccessible to further modification. A low level of cell surface full-length GalT was detected by flow cytometry of stable L cells and, significantly, cell surface biotinylation identified this surface GalT as the high-molecular-weight component. From these results, we conclude that if GalT products are transported through the TGN they will be modified to the higher molecular weight species and transported to the cell surface. The efficiency of this modification is also illustrated by the observation that soluble GalT(-T, -S/A) molecules also undergo a late post-translational modification in transfected COS cells just prior to secretion.",

It should be pointed out that in HeLa cells GalT has been localized not only to the trans-Go\\gi, but also to the TGN (Nilsson et al, 1993b) . There could be differences in the localization of GalT in HeLa cells compared with COS and L cells. Alternatively, as the TGN is an extensive membrane network it is possible that subdomains exist within this compartment so that actively retained GalT, even within the TGN, remains inaccessible to late modifications. Only the GalT molecules in transit through the TGN would then be modified ( Figure 10 ). These findings contrast with TGN38/41 and furin, both TGN-resident proteins, which have retrieval signals in their long cytoplasmic domains, allowing their return from the cell surface (Luzio et al, 1990; Reaves et al, 1992; Bos et al, 1993; Humphreys et al, 1993; Stanley and Howell, 1993; Chapman and Munro, 1994; Molloy et al, 1994; Wilde et al, 1994) . In view of the results presented here, and as the majority of glycosyltransferases have short cytoplasmic tails, it seems likely that active retention, rather than retrieval, could be a common feature for this group of resident Golgi proteins.",

As the Golgi localization of fulllength GalT is not readily saturated in transfected cells (Nilsson et al, 1991; Aoki et al, 1992; Russo et al, 1992; Teasdale et al, 1992) , and as the localization of GalT does not appear to involve a retrieval system, a classical receptor-mediated mechanism is unlikely. Retention may be due to the aggregation of resident Golgi molecules within the specific microenvironment of the Golgi subcompartments (Machamer, 1991; Nilsson et al, 1993; Gleeson et al, 1994) . Here we have shown that full-length GalT in transfected L cells was very susceptible to efficient cross-linking, indicating the existence of GalT oligomers or aggregates. Other studies have also indicated that Golgi proteins can self-associate. For example, Nilsson et al. (1994) showed that the addition of an ER retention motif to the GlcNAc transferase I cytoplasmic tail not only causes GlcNAc transferase I to localize to the ER, but also partially retains another medial-Go\\g'\\ enzyme, namely a-mannosidase II, within the ER. Burke (1994) has demonstrated co-precipitation of GlcNAc transferase II activity, another medial-Go\\gi enzyme, using specific GlcNAc transferase I antibodies. Aggregation has also been shown to correlate with Golgi retention of a hybrid protein containing the transmembrane domain of M glycoprotein of the avian coronavirus (Weisz et al., 1993) . These investigators demonstrated that the appearance of SDS-resistant aggregates of the M hybrid protein correlated with Golgi localization, whereas mislocalized transmembrane domain point mutants do not oligomerize. Further characterization of these aggregates is required to understand how these resident Golgi proteins are retained within these membranes.",
