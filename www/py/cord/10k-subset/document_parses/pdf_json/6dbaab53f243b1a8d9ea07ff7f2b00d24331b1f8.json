Methods To address this question, data from charts of 123 patients who have died after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were extracted. In detail, the time line of the clinical course, the symptoms, the administered drugs and other applied procedures were analysed. Results Approximately one half of the patients, who have died after stem cell transplantation, did not live more than 5 months. Two-thirds of patients died within 14 months after SCT. 28.5% of the patients could not be discharged after transplantation. However, a significant proportion had a low ECOG-score (0-1) prior to death, indicating a high degree of mobility. Major symptoms were weakness, fatigue and need for aid at daily activities.

The prognosis after alloSCT has improved substantially over the last decades and the development of the 'reduced-intense-conditioning' (RIC) or 'non-myeloablative conditioning' therapy protocols allows successful transplantation of elderly or heavily pre-treated patients (Niederwieser et al. 2003 ). In addition, introduction of a variety of drugs into supportive therapy led to a further improvement of prognosis. This includes antimycotic and antiviral therapy (Marr et al. 2002; Mora-Duarte et al. 2002; Yahav et al. 2009 ). In addition, improvement of molecular diagnostic facilitates early detection of rare or otherwise difficult to diagnose infections (Busemann et al. 2012) . The identification of an appropriate stem cell donor is no problem in Europe since large registries have been established. The long-term outcome after alloSCT depends on a variety of factors such as underlying disease, donor's HLA-match, patient's age and performance and complications, e.g. manifestation of acute or chronic Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD). Generally, there is a broad range of overall survival from >80% down to <10%. In general, for all patients, long-term survival after alloSCT has been reported for less than 50% (Gooley et al. 2010) . Vice versa, from this fact, it can be clearly deduced that a significant proportion of the other half of all alloSCT patients might benefit from appropriate palliative care measures during their end of life period.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 123, "text": "(Forman et al. 1999", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 399, "end": 424, "text": "(Niederwieser et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 591, "end": 609, "text": "(Marr et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 610, "end": 634, "text": "Mora-Duarte et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 635, "end": 652, "text": "Yahav et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 787, "end": 809, "text": "(Busemann et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1369, "text": "(Gooley et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The most important element in the concept of alloSCT is a curative treatment approach under acceptance of considerable to life-threatening side effects and a substantially lowered quality of life for a limited period. In contrast to the common patients of standard intensive care units, patients undergoing an allogeneic transplantation start usually in a relative good healthy condition. The following treatment, however, is extremely physical and mental demanding, and associated with a considerable therapy related morbidity and mortality. In contrast, palliative care wants to control the symptoms of the illness and to preserve the best quality of life for the remaining lifetime of the patient (Joske and McGrath 2007) . Both approaches seem to be very controversial. The staff of each discipline, SCT and palliative care, may not have the best opinion about the other group (Chung et al. 2009 ). However, even in the field of alloSCT, the symptom control has an irreplaceable role. Myeloablative conditioning may lead to a mucositis requiring a substantial analgesic therapy, graftversus host disease can induce severe diarrhoea and damages of the integument (Deeg 2007) . Nausea and vomiting under conditioning may be very intensive and need special prophylactic measures and a management by a dedicated team of experts (Bearman et al. 1989 ).
