Resistance to a number of existing drugs and evidence of the emergence of artemisinin resistance has emphasized the need for new antimalarials. A new approach has been the preparation of dual-function compounds that include a chloroquine-like antimalarial group and a group that resembles a chloroquine chemosensitizer. This article reviews the recent discovery of such dual-function antimalarials that are proposed to target both hemozoin formation and the chloroquine resistance transporter, PfCRT. These are discussed in relation to the mechanism of action of 4-aminoquinolines, chloroquine resistance and resistance reversal.",

Despite a 25% decrease in mortality since 2000, one child still dies of malaria every minute. The disease is caused by four species of protozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium that are specific to humans, namely Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. A fifth species, Plasmodium knowlesi, which primarily infects monkeys, has also been recognized as a zoonotic cause of human malaria in Indonesia [2] . Of these species, P. falciparum is the most deadly. All are transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles.",

The parasite also possesses an endogenous cytosolic Fe-superoxide dismutase and imports a host peroxiredoxin from the red blood cell into the parasite cytosol [15, 16] .

RBC cytoplasm is taken up into the malaria parasite via transport vesicles in an endocytotic process and delivered to the acidic digestive vacuole (~pH5) [86] .

Currently, agreement about the details of this step has not been reached [90] [91] [92] .

            "text": "future science group P. falciparum could be accounted for on the basis of an additional interaction: a chargeassisted hydrogen bond between a protonated amine nitrogen atom in the side chain of the drug and one of the heme propionate groups. This interaction has recently been confirmed in crystal structures of quinine-Fe(III)heme and quinidine-Fe(III)heme ( Figure 2B & 2C) [20]. By contrast, the structures of 4-aminoquinoline-Fe(III)heme complexes remain less well understood, despite various efforts to use nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to elucidate them [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . In addition, the precise relationship between heme binding and hemozoin inhibition remains unclear. Early postulates involved stoichiometric solution complexes of antimalarials with Fe(III)heme [30] and included suggestions that drugs act by increasing Fe(III)heme solubility, thus preventing aggregation [30, 31] . More recently, however, an alternative suggestion by Buller et al. has enjoyed considerable attention [32] . These authors, among others, have suggested that this class of drug can dock into the fastest-growing face of the hemozoin crystal, as well as inhibit growth of some of the other faces [32] [33] [34] [35] . This hypothesis has been able to mathematically account for the effects of chloroquine and quinidine on the kinetics of synthetic hemozoin (b-hematin) formation [36] . In addition, it can also explain how substoichiometric quantities of a drug can inhibit hemozoin formation and provides a well-defined binding site for these compounds. To date, however, this model does not appear to have been directly used to try to design new inhibitors using a rational approach, probably because conventional drug-docking programs are not able to handle crystal surfaces well.",

            "text": "Despite ample evidence that quinoline and related antimalarials inhibit b-hematin formation under abiotic and biomimetic conditions, direct evidence of inhibition of hemozoin formation in the parasite itself is much more sparse. Chloroquine and, more recently, ruthenoquine, an analog of the 4-aminoquinoline ferroquine in which the ferrocene moiety is replaced by ruthenocene, have been shown to accumulate in the parasite DV in close proximity to hemozoin [37, 38] . Smaller hemozoin crystals and a premature halt in their growth within the parasite DV has been observed in the presence of chloroquine [39] . Finally, at 120 nM and 12-h incubation times, chloroquine causes a build-up of transport vesicles in the parasite, which contain undigested Hb [40] , indicating that the endocytotic feeding process is inhibited. Recently, a fractionation strategy has been applied together with electron spectroscopic imaging to chloroquine-treated P. falciparum [41] . This has clearly shown a dose-dependent increase in free Fe(III)heme occurring together with the decrease in hemozoin. Undigested Hb only seems to appear at higher doses of chloroquine, and the levels of free Fe(III)heme are closely correlated with the parasite survival curve (Figure 3 ). Electron spectroscopic imaging using electron energy loss spectroscopy clearly showed a translocation of iron to the parasite cytoplasm ( Figure 4A & 4B) . Since virtually all of the iron present is heme iron and there is little undigested Hb at the dose used, this is likely to be the location of the free Fe(III)heme. There The aromatic ring lies parallel to the porphyrin ring in a p-stacking arrangement. In the cases of the quinidine and quinine complexes, a charge-assisted hydrogen bond (salt bridge) occurs between one of the heme propionate groups and the protonated quinuclidine tertiary amino group. The structural models shown here were created using data taken from [19, 20] .",

Rather, resistance arises from mutations and changes in expression levels of membrane proteins located in the DV membrane. The principal determinants of chloroquine resistance are mutant forms of a protein known as PfCRT [50, 51] . A second protein, PfMDR1, has also been implicated in resistance to quinoline antimalarials [52, 53] . Mutations in this protein are associated future science group with mefloquine resistance in field isolates, and an increased copy number has previously been associated with decreased sensitivity to quinine. PfMDR1 is not thought to be directly responsible for chloroquine resistance, but mutant forms of this protein can affect chloroquine sensitivity in the presence of mutant forms of PfCRT [54] , and there is evidence of a complex interaction between PfCRT and PfMDR1 [55] . In addition, PfMDR1 has recently been implicated in the transport of chloroquine and other quinolines into the parasite DV [56] and has subsequently also been shown to bind to a selection of these drugs [57] . Furthermore, evidence from a cross of two different drug-resistant strains (GB4 and 7G8) has indicated that quinolines actually inhibit transport of the natural substrates of PfCRT and PGH-1 (the protein encoded by PfMDR1) [58] . A third protein, PfMRP1, located in the parasite plasma membrane, has also been suggested to play a role in chloroquine resistance, but in this case, the evidence remains uncertain [59, 60] . Notwithstanding the role of these other membrane proteins, a PfCRT mutation is accepted to be the major factor involved in chloroquine resistance.",

Chloroquineresistant strains of the parasite exhibit several mutations in this protein ( Figure 6 ) [62] , but all naturally occurring chloroquine-resistant mutants exhibit one crucial mutation, that of Lys-76 to Thr-76 (K76T). The additional mutations to K76T are thought to counteract the loss of function that would occur in the case of the K76T mutation alone [63] . Studies conducted using Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with mRNA encoding PfCRT have convincingly shown that this protein transports chloroquine. These findings support the hypothesis that decreased activity of chloroquine stems from its extrusion by PfCRT from the DV. This effectively lowers the concentration of chloroquine in this organelle, thus permitting hemozoin formation to resume unhindered [64] . Chloroquine is also thought to bind to PfCRT, and a possible site of interaction has been proposed based on photoaffinity labeling [65] . Several recent and comprehensive reviews covering PfCRT and chloroquine resistance are available, and readers are encouraged to consult them for in-depth discussion [62, [66] [67] [68] .",

Subsequent to this initial discovery, many other compounds have been found to have similar chemosensitizing properties. These include other calcium channel blockers, including analogs of verapamil and nifedipine; dibenzazepines and their analogs, which include imipramine; phenothiazines; dihydroanthracenes; dibenzylmethylamines (dibemethins); plant-derived alkaloids; and others, including primaquine [71] . A common feature of nearly all of these compounds is a basic amino group that is expected to be protonated at the pH of the parasite DV. These compounds are believed to act by inhibiting chloroquine transport by PfCRT, and this has been directly demonstrated in the case of verapamil, primaquine and several dibemethins in the Xenopus oocyte system [64, 72] . It is not known whether these compounds act as competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors of chloroquine transport. Two significant quantitative structure-activity relationship studies have been carried out on chloroquine chemosensitizers. One exclusively investigated a series of dihydroanthracene derivatives with rigid bicyclic structures [73] . Based on this study, the authors suggested that these molecules interact with a serine (or threonine) and an aspartate (or glutamate) side chain in PfCRT, which are separated by 9.2 \u00c5. In a second study, which has turned out to be more influential, a The 4-aminoquinoline group is the smallest Fe(III)heme-binding fragment [43] . Replacement of the quinoline ring N atom with a CH group abolishes interaction with Fe(III)heme, as well as hemozoin inhibitory activity and biological activity [45] . Replacement of the 4-amino NH group with a CH 2 group weakens Fe(III)heme binding and also abolishes hemozoin inhibition and biological activity [45] . The Cl atom is necessary for the inhibition of hemozoin formation. It can be replaced with other electron-withdrawing hydrophobic groups [44] . The tertiary N atom in the side chain is important for accumulation in the parasite digestive vacuole through pH trapping, and it usually improves activity [43] . Analogs are known in which this N atom is replaced with a CH, retaining biological activity [42] .",

The first example, a so-called reversed chloroquine (Compound 1), was reported in 2006 [75] . This consisted of a 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline moiety linked to the N atom of imipramine via a three-carbon alkyl linker group ( Figure 8A) . Compound 1 was shown to be active in vitro against both the chloroquine-sensitive D6 and chloroquine-resistant Dd2 strains of P. falciparum. It was also shown to associate with Fe(III)heme, both at pH 5.7 and 7, with log association constant (logK ) values of 5.48 (comparable to chloroquine, with values of 5.48 and 6.00, respectively, at these two pH values). However, Compound 1 itself was not considered suitable for further drug development owing to its high lipophilicity (log distribution constant [clogP] = 8.9). In a follow-up study, Peyton and coworkers investigated the effects of the linker and head groups in the activity of a range of reversed chloroquines [76] . In one study, the head group was altered to a diphenylamine or dibenzylamine, while the aliphatic portion of the side chain and linker chain were varied in length in an effort to reduce lipophilicity [76] . All of these compounds demonstrated strong activity against parasites cultured in vitro (IC 50 <120 nM), with only minor differences between chloroquinesensitive and -resistant D6 and Dd2 strains. Larger differences were seen in cytotoxicity, with molecules possessing amide or piperazine linkers exhibiting the lowest toxicity. Nonetheless, all of the compounds tested exhibited well over 100-fold selectivity against malaria parasites. Closer scrutiny of the IC 50 values showed that a dibenzylamine head group usually gave rise to a more active compound than the corresponding compound with a diphenylamine head group, and that replacement of the linear diamine linker with a piperazine group also generally decreased activity. On the other hand, introduction of an amide head group was tolerated and permitted a decrease in clogP to values comparable to chloroquine.",

Interestingly, the variations in head group had a relatively small influence on activity against either the D6 chloroquine-sensitive or Dd2 chloroquineresistant strains of the parasite, but considerably more variation was observed in activity against the 7G8 chloroquine-resistant strain. Indeed, in many of the derivatives, activity against the 7G8 strain was four-to five-fold weaker than against the D6 or Dd2 strains. This is notable in view of the fact that the 7G8 strain, which originates from South America, differs from the Old World D6 and Dd2 strains in as much as verapamil has only weak chemosensitizing activity on it. This perhaps supports the proposal that the activities of these compounds relates to the presence of a resistance-reversing pharmacophore. Of particular note, however, is a derivative, Compound 2, in which the phenyl rings in the head group were replaced with ortho-pyridyl groups ( Figure 8B ) [77] . This compound was equipotent against all three of the tested strains and is substantially less lipophilic (clogP = 3.6) than the other compounds, a factor that is important in improving solubility and potentially lowering systemic toxicity. This compound represents a potential lead compound for further development. Indeed, it was found to possess good oral activity in the Plasmodium berghei mouse model of malaria, with four doses at 30 mg/kg reducing parasitemia by more than 99% and curing two out of three treated mice.",

However, less hydrophobic compounds would still be more desirable and represent a priority for any further development of this series.",

In addition, in at least one group, the dibemequines, inhibition of the transport of chloroquine by PfCRT in the Xenopus oocyte has been directly demonstrated. In a review, Peyton has also reported that similar activity has been observed, but not yet published in the case of the reversed chloroquines [82] . These compounds have been shown to exhibit strong in vitro antimalarial activity against a substantial number of chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant parasite strains, with no significant cross-resistance with chloroquine. Thus, in many respects, these compounds have excellent properties for further development. However, there are some serious obstacles that will need to be overcome.",

            "text": "Weak base compounds, particularly hydrophobic weak bases, frequently exhibit inhibitory activity against hERG, a potassium channel found in cardiac muscle. This can lead to prolonged QT intervals and potentially fatal heart arrhythmias [83] . Indeed, in the case of at least one antimalarial drug, halofantrine, this problem has actually been encountered clinically [84] . Unfortunately, hERG toxicity is difficult to predict with certainty. Nonetheless, Gleeson has carried out a principal components ana lysis of approximately 30,000 compounds for which absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity data had been collected at Glaxo-SmithKline and found that while there is a greater potential for hERG liability in basic molecules than in acidic or neutral ones, the liability is generally much reduced if the compound has a molecular weight below 400 and a calculated cLogP below 4 [85] . Indeed, this also improves druggability in a number of other ways. For example, it improves solubility, permeability and volume of distribution, decreases protein binding and lowers the potential of the compound to inhibit cytochrome P450. As noted above, Peyton and coworkers have already produced reversed chloroquines with much improved cLogP values [77] . A dibemequine analog has also been produced with a cLogP well below 4 future science group and a molecular weight below 400 [Egan TJ et al., Unpublished Data] . While it has not yet been demonstrated that any of these compounds actually have reduced hERG liability, it does at least suggest that improvement is possible with this class of compound.",

It is not currently known whether these compounds inhibit chloroquine transport competitively or noncompetitively. They could bring about inhibition either by themselves being transported in preference to chloroquine or by binding to PfCRT and blocking chloroquine transport. The latter seems more likely, since one would expect resistant parasites to be resistant to the dualfunction molecule if it were transported out of the DV more efficiently than chloroquine. If used as monotherapies, these compounds might have an increased risk of rapid development of resistance because of their ability to bind to chloroquine-resistant mutants of PfCRT. It is possible that point mutations may then lead from binding to transport. This potential problem would likely be lessened by use of combination therapy. In addition, with the exception of one group of reversed chloroquines, the activities of these compounds against South American strains such as 7G8, with reduced sensitivity to verapamil resistance reversal, have not been",
