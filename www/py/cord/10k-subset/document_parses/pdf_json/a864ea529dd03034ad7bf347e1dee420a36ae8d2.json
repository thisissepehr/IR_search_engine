Genetic robustness affords maintenance of phenotype despite mutational input, necessarily involving the role of epistasis. Environmental robustness is phenotypic constancy in the face of environmental variation, where epistasis may be uninvolved. Here we discuss genetic and environmental robustness, from the standpoint of infectious disease evolution, and suggest that robustness may be a unifying principle for understanding how different disease agents evolve. We focus especially on viruses with RNA genomes due to their importance in the evolution of emerging diseases and as model systems to test robustness theory. We present new data on adaptive constraints for a model RNA virus challenged to evolve in response to UV radiation. We also draw attention to other infectious disease systems where robustness theory may prove useful for bridging evolutionary biology and biomedicine, especially the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, immune evasion by influenza, and malaria parasite infections.",

Robustness is a modern concept in biology with the potential to serve as a unifying principle, as it has already been wielded in vastly different contexts, including yeast metabolism, embryology, cancer biology, and many others. In general, robustness describes the capacity for an organism to persist in the presence of perturbations of various kinds. Robustness exists in several forms, with genetic robustness the most provocative among them, describing the ability of organisms to resist phenotypic change in the presence of genetic variation itself, influencing the ability for natural selection to act on heritable genetic information (evolvability). Several recent studies have fortified the importance of testing robustness empirically, where one can detect evolvable differences using various methods. These studies, however, highlight both the opportunities and obstacles involved with the empirical study of robustness. Because many of these studies have utilized microorganisms, the infectious disease paradigm is a candidate area for further application of robustness theory. One can argue that recent findings in several infectious disease systems, including bacterial drug resistance, influenza, HIV, and malaria, are germane to the robustness concept. The hope is that further application of robustness theory might aid in how we study, and treat, infectious diseases of many types.",

Experiments using artificial life \u0351\"digital organisms,\" selfreplicating computer programs that can evolve\u0352 valuably demonstrated that elevated mutation rates can select for evolved increases in genetic robustness to tolerate mutation, even at the expense of reduced reproductive fitness. 9 The explanation was that high mutation rates could selectively favor genetic variants that were not necessarily productive and resided on flat regions of the \"fitness landscape;\" these robust genotypes formed an epistatic network that produced equally fit phenotypes despite mutation-induced movement across the landscape \u0351Fig. 1\u0352. 6, 8, 10 Other landmark studies have successfully examined robustness by considering phenotypic effects of mutations underlying proteins using computational and in vitro approaches. 11, 12 Viruses with RNA genomes are natural systems that typically experience high mutation rates owing to their lack of error-repair during replication. Thus, RNA viruses have proved to be useful and tractable models for studying robustness evolution in biological populations. This work has focused on the success of robust versus nonrobust RNA virus variants when mutation rates are further elevated through exposure to ultraviolet \u0351UV\u0352 light and other mutagens, 13 and on evolved changes in robustness under frequent virus coin-fection, which allows buffering of mutational effects via complementation. 14 Below we review some of the evidence from these studies, and present new findings from an increasingly popular model system for examining evolution of robustness: the segmented RNA bacteriophage 6. [14] [15] [16] In reviewing these results, we hope to highlight the importance of empirical work in RNA viruses for testing theory pertaining to robustness, as well as for better understanding the evolutionary biology and evolvability of infectious organisms in general.",

However, viruses can employ complementation, a mechanism whereby low-fitness genotypes can use, to their advantage, intracellular proteins made by coinfecting strains of high fitness. [19] [20] [21] Coinfection combined with complementation can therefore provide phenotypic buffering in the event of genomic mutations, similar to other buffering mechanisms such as gene duplication and diploidy that might be positively selected because they facilitate canalization in higher organisms. 22, 23 Complementation can buffer against negative fitness effects of deleterious alleles in coinfecting populations of viruses. 20 This buffering effect introduces an ecologically determined community-level robustness which renders their individuallevel robustness less necessary. This logic infers that the degree of coinfection-high multiplicity of infection \u0351MOI; ratio of viruses to cells\u0352 versus low MOI-should influence evolution of robustness in virus populations. 14 We note that many other phenomena consequential for virus evolution can occur as a result of coinfection, especially genetic exchange \u0351recombination\u0352 between viruses and selection for virus \"cheaters\" such as defective-interfering particles. 24 For brevity we limit our discussion to complementation that occurs during coinfection and its potential role in the evolution of virus robustness.",

Results from the mutation accumulation analysis supported the hypothesis that viruses historically evolved under frequent coinfection became relatively less genetically robust than those evolved under rare coinfection. 14 One alternative explanation for the observations would be a higher mutation rate in the viruses evolved at high MOI, causing them to experience a greater number of fixed mutations \u0351and hence, greater fitness loss\u0352 during the mutation accumulation; however, no evidence suggests that these viruses mutate at rates higher than their counterparts evolved at low MOI. 14, 15 Thus, the study provided the first evidence that genetic robustness could evolve to change in biological populations.",

One study examined two species of viroids that differed in robustness. 13 The robust viroid species had a low reproductive capacity in plants but a large neutral neighborhood of mutations \u0351fraction of one-error mutations that do not change minimum free energy RNAsecondary structure\u0352, whereas the brittle viroid had the opposite combination of traits. It was hypothesized that brittle viroids should outgrow robust viroids when coinfecting plants under ordinary conditions, but the robust viroids should be favored in the presence of a mutagen because they better maintained phenotype \u0351proper structure\u0352 despite mutational input. As predicted, under standard growth conditions in host plants, results showed that the brittle viroid was selectively favored. In contrast, when infected plants were subjected to irradiation by ultraviolet C \u0351UVC; short wave UV light of wavelength 280-100 nm\u0352, this known viroid mutagen caused the robust viroid to be favored in competition, because it better withstood growth despite mutation. 13 Thus, this empirical outcome in biological populations was consistent with the earlier findings seen in artificial-life studies. 9 A second study used an RNA virus of eukaryotes and two different mutagens, but found very similar results to those described above. 27 Vesicular stomatitis virus \u0351VSV\u0352 is an ssRNA virus that is vector-transmitted by some insects and causes disease in certain mammal species. 28, 29 Two diverged populations of VSV were characterized for reproductive growth on tissue culture cells, and for within-population variance among clones for this phenotype; this effort revealed that one population was slow-growing but relatively less variable in clone phenotypes \u0351robust\u0352 and the other had the opposite characteristics \u0351brittle\u0352. 27 Whereas standard growth conditions allowed the faster replicating brittle virus population to outcompete the slower replicating robust population, exposure to either of two mutagens favored the robust variant. These results echoed the earlier studies where competition under elevated mutation rates was observed to favor robust populations, even though robustness was associated with reduced reproduction. 9, 13 While several of these studies have provided evidence for extant, evolvable differences in robustness, the literature is generally lacking in examples of direct selection for robustness in biological systems. In an effort to examine direct selection for RNA virus resistance to UVC damage, here we present new data from a short-term experimental evolution study with phage 6. These results underscore some of the biological, methodological, and conceptual barriers to observing direct selection for robustness in RNA virus systems.",

These data were informative because they indicated that the strong selection created through high dosage of UVC exposure was too overwhelming for viruses to be ecologically sustained, and/or to experience spontaneous genetic variation useful for meeting the environmental challenge. The latter outcome clearly demonstrated an evolutionary constraint for the virus. Last, all of the evolved populations in the low dosage \u03512.5 min UVC exposure\u0352 treatment were extant by end of the study.

Thus, we did not observe adaptive increases in virus resistance to UV degradation, presumably involving mutagenesis. However, the experimental evolution was of relatively short duration, and additional selection might produce adaptive resistance to UVC damage. Nevertheless, a lack of adaptive response may be unsurprising in phage 6, because elsewhere we showed that genetically robust and brittle strains of the virus generated in the aforementioned MOI experiment did not statistically differ when assayed for UVC survival. 16 Thus, neither direct selection \u0351current findings\u0352 nor indirect selection for robustness against UVC damage was evident in this study system. These observations may be explained by a relatively high level of robustness to UV damage in phage 6, which has already run the gamut of selection, creating a constraint for the virus to improve any further. One ecological explanation may be that the virus naturally infects plant pathogenic bacteria that colonize leaf surfaces, 37 suggesting that prior adaptation to resist UV damage might have precluded observations of further adaptive response in the laboratory.",

First, claiming that an organism has directly evolved robustness through natural selection requires a nuanced understanding of how a given environmental stressor impacts an evolvable entity. Such knowledge can be dubious in the RNA virus context, as stressors such as UVC might impact RNA viruses in multiple ways. [30] [31] [32] Even further, if a test population evolves an adaptive response to an environmental challenge, one has to be cautious in distinguishing resistance from robustness. While both involve the ability to withstand the influence of perturbations, robustness describes a more generalized response that affects performance in multiple environments 1,2 and evolvability. 15, 16 ",

But later work examining the relationship between robustness and evolvability is perhaps even more relevant for elucidating how infectious diseases evolve. On the one hand, the ability for robustness to allow phenotypic constancy in the face of environmental and mutational perturbation provides obvious benefits, such as reliable cellular function, individual development, and offspring reproduction. However, rigidity in the face of change may pose problems; because natural selection acts on phenotypic variation, robustness that buffers this variation could impede evolution by natural selection. These conflicting necessities force organisms to strike a balance between robustness and evolvability, the capacity to adapt. By examining this balancing act, we may learn whether evolvability can itself evolve; i.e., whether natural selection can exert a second-degree effect on evolution. Below we briefly describe two recent experiments on the relationship between robustness and evolvability.",

            "text": "One experiment showed that genetic robustness improved evolvability of phage 6 populations when heat shock was used as an adaptive challenge. 15 Phage 6 is typically cultured at 25\u00b0C, and exposure to 45\u00b0C heat shock for as little as 5 min leads to \u03f320% survival \u0351%S\u0352 in populations of the virus. Robust and brittle clones of the virus from the aforementioned MOI experiment 14 were used to found lineages passaged for 50 generations of experimental evolution with periodic \u0351every fifth generation\u0352 exposure to 45\u00b0C heat shock. At the end of the study, we measured mean %S at 45\u00b0C measured for each founding clone and its derived end point population to estimate \u232c%S, the change in percent survival after heat-shock selection. The results showed that the lineages founded by robust genotypes were more evolvable \u0351greater \u232c%S\u0352, indicating that robustness promoted evolvability in phage 6, under the test conditions. The explanation was that robust genotypes of phage 6 may have proteins that better tolerate mutations while maintaining proper folding especially at moderate temperatures, 16 similar to suggestions from in vitro studies where less-sensitive \u0351relatively robust\u0352 proteins seem more likely to maintain their function in a new environment where innovation is needed. 11 That is, despite equivalent sensitivity to 45\u00b0C heat shock in the robust and brittle founding strains, the robust viruses may have proteins that tend to be capable of undergoing mutations while maintaining their proper folding when 45\u00b0C constitutes a selective environment. 15 Whether this exact relationship extends to other novel environments has yet to be explored. But the fact that a positive relationship exists at all is essential for tests of existing theory, 8 and begs the question of whether the observed relationship between genetic robustness and evolvability extends to evolution of human pathogens, as implicated in recent claims of evolved increases in genetic robustness in HIV. 38 Antiviral therapy consisting of chemical mutagenesis that induces an insurmountable mutational load seems promising for treatment of RNA virus infections. [39] [40] [41] But such measures may select for RNA viruses to evolve altered polymerases with improved replication fidelity that reduces genomic mutation rates. 42 Alternatively, viruses may be selected to evolve mechanisms of genetic robustness where high mutation rates are preserved but phenotypic effects of the mutagen are buffered. This outcome is perhaps unlikely given the empirical data thus far. 43 However, further data involving a variety of different viruses are warranted, and the results from experimental evolution studies caution that robustness may be positively related to evolvability and to competitive superiority in RNA viruses. 15 A second experiment centered closely on the potential link between robustness and pathogen evolvability on novel hosts. Environmental robustness of a virus may be defined in terms of its host generalization \u0351host range, the number of host types it can productively infect\u0352. 44 Theory predicts that evolved generalization may be particularly useful if organ-isms tend to encounter environments that change unexpectedly. 45 That is, generalists may be favored by selection because they are better predisposed to survive and give rise to successful progeny in the face of variable environments, relative to specialists that possess a narrow niche. This idea may explain why pathogens with a pre-existing broad host range seem better able to emerge on novel hosts, relative to specialized pathogens. [46] [47] [48] To test this idea directly, we used populations of VSV that evolved differences in host use because of prior selection in constant versus variable host environments. 49, 50 The formal prediction was that VSV populations experiencing direct selection for host range would have higher mean growth and less variance in mean growth on a collection of challenge hosts, compared to VSV populations that were either relatively specialized or indirectly selected for host range. 51 When challenged to grow on four novel hosts in vitro, the viruses that had been selected for generalism exhibited higher or equivalent host growth, lower among-population variance in host growth, and lower variance in population growth across hosts. Thus, these three predictions relating to the hypothesis were generally supported because direct selection for host breadth more often allowed successful emergence. The results suggested that determination of current niche breadth should be further investigated as a potentially useful indicator in predicting pathogen emergence. 51, 52 Because these many recent empirical breakthroughs in the study of robustness have involved microbes, one might predict that infectious disease is the primary biomedical realm where these robustness results might have an immediate, practical impact. Below we describe three examples of biomedically important human disease systems where robustness theory appears highly relevant.",

Research shows that compensatory mutation is an important underlying genetic mechanism for maintenance of resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection. 53 This epistasis mechanism explains how a resistance gene that is costly for bacterial growth in absence of an antibiotic may be compensated by one or more mutations in the plasmid or bacterial chromosome, effectively eliminating the cost of carrying the resistance gene \u0351or the plasmid on which it re-sides\u0352 when no antibiotic is present. If a bacterial strain contains a compensatory mutation that interacts to reduce the cost of various different resistance genes, then this epistatic mutation would provide an example of a genetic-robustness allele responsible for environmental robustness across antibiotic environments. For example, the multiple antibiotic resistance locus in E. coli and several species of Salmonella is involved with production of an efflux pump that removes various antibiotics from the cell, affording low-level clinical resistance. 54 However, this mode of resistance can be rather costly if transport in and out of the cell is not tightly regulated. Evidence suggests that the low-level resistance may be a stepping-stone to more finely tuned evolved mechanisms allowing greater resistance, 55 and we can conceive that genetic changes simultaneously compensating to reduce the cost while maintaining the broad resistance would provide an example of a genetic-robustness allele.",

This shift then facilitates escape from host immunity, and fosters the ability for the virus to infect a new class of susceptible hosts. Although these studies make no explicit mention of the role of such genetic robustness in flu epidemics, 55,56 the available evidence strongly suggests that the phenomenon is relevant in this case of influenza strain H3N2. Genetic robustness in the hemagglutinin \u0351HA\u0352 gene of strain H3N2 allows the virus to drift through neutral genotypic space without a change in phenotype until it reaches a rapid saltational phenotypic shift that permits the ability for strains derived from this virus to reemerge in humans. This model is compatible with other robustness-evolvability links outlined in the literature. 57, 7, 8 Judging from phylogenetic and molecular evolution analyses of clinical isolates, it appears that the HA gene of influenza A virus appears to be under strong selection by the human immune system, 58 and perhaps this has been true for much of the evolutionary history of flu disease in humans.",

But a relatively larger neutral network would afford greater robustness of HA genes in influenza, affording long-term persistence of the virus as it drifts neutrally through sequence space before fortuitously achieving a genotype with a beneficial novel surface antigen that promotes reemergence.",

Influenza A virus is notorious for its characteristically broad host range, including various bird species and mammals such as domesticated pigs whose proximity to humans may spur pandemics. [59] [60] [61] As noted earlier, relatively broad host range of a pathogen may be defined as environmental robustness. The ability for influenza A viruses to traverse the aforementioned neutral network of genetic robustness may have an important environmental robustness component. The virus may be able to easily create a robust neutral network of genotypes associated with attachment/entry of various host cells due to intrinsic environmental robustness that evolved via selection to infect a variety of host environments. In influenza A virus, whether environmental robustness preceded genetic robustness, or vice versa, is difficult to know. But environmental robustness of viruses such as influenza A virus undoubtedly fosters the ability to reside in various host species that may serve as reservoirs that allow occasional spillover into a species of interest such as humans. 52 Robustness may also be relevant in explaining aspects of the current AIDS pandemic. A global increase in robustness has been invoked to explain an apparent global decline in the virulence of HIV-1 strains. 38 Although it was not discussed extensively, the robustness concept in this example seems to be environmentally, not mutationally, determined. The argument is that a perceived decline in HIV-1 virulence might be due to generally evolved increase in environmental robustness of the virus, owing to its worldwide spread. The virus has thus encountered variable subpopulations of humans and has undergone selection for environmental robustness, which coincides with improved performance across environments at the expense of reduced reproduction \u0351i.e., virulence\u0352 on average. This explanation assumes that the stated tradeoff in viral traits is a generalized phenomenon, and that results for increased genetic robustness at the expense of reduced reproduction 9,13 apply in the case of environmental robustness as well.",

This idea is supported by studies in which parasite exposure to chemical compounds neutralizes binding to host receptors, fortifying the importance of invasion to the establishment of a clinical infection. 62, 63 Thus, many therapeutic measures against a variety of pathogens rely on this vital receptor-ligand interaction. Virus examples include the seasonal influenza vaccine, and fusion inhibitor compounds, a class of anti-HIV therapies. 64, 65 In nonvirus parasites the situation is more complicated, because the process of invasion is a complex module involving several different effectors. One possible example of a robust invasion module is in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most deadly form of human malaria. In P. falciparum and the apicomplexan parasites, an apical complex is central to the invasion process, which includes multiple steps involving protein interactions and temporally and spatially regulated expression of proteases and polymerization machinery. 63, 66, 67 Given the importance of erythrocytes as cells where parasite replication occurs, one might expect that P. falciparum interactions with erythrocytes should be particularly critical in a robustness module for the FIG. 3 . \u0351Color online\u0352 Robustness in gene networks of influenza A HA genes. Phenotypes are genetically robust, allowing genotypes to drift through genotypic neutral space before instant shifts in phenotype.

Reprinted with permission from AAAS.\u0354 pathogen. In fact, studies show that the erythrocyteattachment process involves redundancy in ligands used for binding of the pathogen to erythrocyte receptors. 68, 62 This evolved strategy might have been selected in P. falciparum because erythrocyte receptors are highly polymorphic, perhaps among the fastest evolving genes in the human genome. 69, 70 Research shows that P. falciparum utilizes a plethora of ligands to bind erythrocyte receptors. 62, 68, 70 Interestingly, a \"molecular hierarchy\" may be the ideal term to describe ligand usage in P. falciparum; the pathogen's invasion module may consist of a hierarchy whereby some ligands used in attachment are preferred over others, with the switch in usage only taking place when a ligand higher up in the hierarchy is ineffective \u0351Fig. 4\u0352. 68 This observation may be usefully couched in terms of robustness, because redundancy is a possible mechanism for constructing a robust biological system. To ensure that an essential function is carried out, a biological system can be organized to contain several alternative pathways in the event that one or more become unavailable or dysfunctional. This evolved strategy decreases the probability that an environmental perturbation disrupts performance.",

Here we have highlighted some of the empirical evidence for evolution of robustness, and discussed its relevance for evolution of infectious diseases, particularly in humans. Despite the widereaching importance of robustness theory in biology and other disciplines, we emphasize that the origins and implications of robustness may be highly context specific. The underlying causes of diseases in humans and other organisms are manifold. To wield the robustness concept effectively in the evolution of infectious diseases, sufficient understanding of how ecological history might have selected for robustness is warranted. Robustness has often resided in the realm of mathematical theory, but future work would benefit from col-laborations between empiricists and theoreticians to test explicitly predictions using tractable models, or disease pathogens. These efforts would help to elucidate further the role of robustness in past evolution of parasites such as influenza A virus and P. falciparum, and to predict how it might play a role in their future evolutionary change.",

One consequence of earth's biodiversity is that exceptions to general rules are often found if one searches hard enough. For example, a popular notion in biomedicine was that parasites should inevitably evolve to become mutualistic to their hosts, because this would afford long-term survival of a parasite species that might otherwise force its host into extinction. However, theory and experiments later overturned this conventional wisdom by demonstrating that infectious parasites may evolve greater or lesser virulence \u0351damage to the host\u0352 depending on their unique ecologies. [71] [72] [73] [74] Similarly, it should be expected that evolution of robustness and its underlying mechanism might differ substantially across the biosphere. Therefore, caution is warranted when attempting to draw widespread conclusions from the handful of valuable empirical studies on evolution of robustness. Perhaps it is possible to construct a universal theory of robustness that applies everywhere, but this is unknown. Our hope is that the exciting studies and biological examples presented here will further motivate researchers in basic science and biomedicine to consider the potential importance of genetic and environmental robustness in a great variety of biological systems. With this impetus, we may amass enough empirical data to help bridge the intellectual gap separating abundant theory on robustness evolution and application of this thinking to applied problems in biomedicine and public health.",
