In light of the classification method proposed in Ref. 4 , the behavioral changes must affect either: (1) the disease state (e.g., healthy state or vaccinated state) of the individual; (2) the infection rate [9] [10] [11] or the recovery rate (may including the contact rate 7 ); or (4) the contact network structure relevant for the spread of disease. 3, [12] [13] [14] [15] In this work, we only consider the effect of individual responses on the infection rate. So, we suppose that the network structure is considered not to depend on the infection level. 11 Although this restriction may limit the realism of our model, it allows us to focus on the information effect for a mild infectious disease, e.g., flu. It is only under an extremely serious epidemic situation that the measures of strong quarantine or isolation would be implemented, 16 which will induce changes in the social network.",

The study of this issue may be classified into the two kinds of perspectives (1) The spread of awareness (or the information transmission), which assumes that the information (generally from an infectious node) undergoes a generation process and a transmission process from individual to individual. In order to study the effect of information transmission, two separate networks can be used for modeling the epidemic spreading and the information spreading, respectively. 9 Another approach is to classify a population with respect to information. 5, 6, 8 In general, the local spread of awareness can stop a disease from spreading, 5, 9 while the global transmission of information can only decrease the prevalence. 5 (2) The reaction of awareness (or the risk perception), which means that an individual promptly obtains relatively accurate information from the current circumstances and responses to the epidemics. In the study of this, the effect of risk perception can be expressed by a function of information. In Refs. 10 and 11, an exponential function of local information is used to study the transition of the level of precautionary measures, where the network structure has important impact on the existence of a value of perception that stops the epidemics. 10 In the present work, we investigate this issue from the second perspective in the heterogenous SF network, which exhibits a broad degree distribution. 17 Different from the previous work (see Refs. 10 and 11), we consider many types of information, which include both local information and global information. One advantage of this approach is that it allows us to study the difference between local information and global information. 4 Besides these prevalence-based information, we also consider one kind of belief-based information 4 which is related to individual nodes' contact numbers called contact information. This accounts for awareness of a higher risk when a node possesses a larger contact number. The study of multiple information complies with the variety and complexity of information in reality. 5 The assumption of the static network allows us to focus on the impact of such multiple information=awareness on the epidemic spreading.",

IV, we present numerical simulations and compare these to the theoretical model and investigate the impact of both the local awareness and the global awareness on the epidemic prevalence (i.e., the final epidemic size); and finally, in Sec. V, we conclude the paper and give some discussion.",

Since we restrict our attention to the impact of multiple awareness (or information) on the epidemic spreading, it is assumed that the connectivity of nodes in networks is uncorrelated, which make the following discussion simpler. The infection rate, the rate that susceptible individuals are infected by an infectious neighbor, is always related to susceptibility and infectivity of individuals. [20] [21] [22] To characterize this, we use the two concepts proposed by Olinky and Stone, 23 the admission rate (characterizing susceptibility) and the transmission rate (characterizing infectivity). The admission rate A i is the rate that susceptible node i would actually admit an infection through an edge connected to an infected node. The transmission rate T i is the rate that infected node i would actually transmit an infection through an edge connected to a susceptible node.",

Although the global awareness has no effect on the epidemic threshold and one cannot decrease the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak through increasing the global awareness (or b), it can decrease the epidemic prevalence. This is in accordance with the previous result 9 and can be verified by simulations. Simulations in Fig. 5 shows that the final epidemic size q decreases with b regardless of k \u00bc 0.2 or k \u00bc 0.4. Fig. 5 also shows that q decreases with a. In general, the rate of change of final epidemic size with respect to a, @q @a 0 and the rate of change of final epidemic size with respect to b, @q @b 0. We further find that the profiles in Fig. 5 are almost straight lines and for the same k the slope of line q vs a is smaller than one of line q vs b, which can be clearly observed since the two lines go across the same point (at this case, a \u00bc b \u00bc 0).

All three forms of awareness can reduce susceptibility to infection. Theoretical analysis and computational simulations indicate that both the contact awareness and the local awareness can raise the epidemic threshold to control epidemic outbreak, while the global awareness only decrease the epidemic prevalence. Hence, even in the absence of immunization procedures or quarantine=isolation measures, an epidemic disease can be controlled by human adaptive reactions. 7, 9 These results accord with previous findings. 5, 9 It is interesting to explore one particular problem: how can the local information have such a strong effect on disease dynamics compared to the global information under the same conditions? 4 Why can the local awareness raise the epidemic threshold but not the global awareness? We attempt to give a possible illustration. We think this is closely related with the heterogeneity of information for the following reasons.",

However, it is not the case for the local information. Let us make stochastic simulations to show this. We consider the averaged infection fraction in the nearest neighborhood (NN) of node i with degree k at the steady state, denoted by q nm k \u00f01\u00de. In Fig. 8 , the relation between q nm k \u00f01\u00de and k is numerically investigated. This plot clearly illustrates the obvious difference from q nm k \u00f01\u00de with respect to k, and further tells us that . i as a function of node i is not uniform. Consequently, for all nodes in a population, the global information is homogenous but the local information is heterogenous (this is similar to the effect of contact awareness 23 ). The heterogeneity of information leads to the heterogeneity of individual awareness. This further leads to the heterogeneity of the infection rate owing to the definition (1). As we know, 22, 23 heterogenous infection rates potentially stop an epidemic outbreak.",
