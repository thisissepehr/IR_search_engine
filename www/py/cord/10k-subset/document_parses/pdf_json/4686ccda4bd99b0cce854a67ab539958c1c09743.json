            "text": "Hepatocarcinogens have been shown to cause marked elevation of hepatic microsomal epoxide hydrolya.se activity in the rat at short intervals after administration. The present studies were designed to characterize 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) mediated epoxide hydrolase elevation and to investigate the relationship between epoxide hydrolase increases, AAF metabolism, and hepatocarcinogenicity. Oral or i.p. administration of AAF to F-344 rats produced log-linear doseresponse curves for epoxide hydrolase elevation, measured with either benzo[a]pyrene-4,5-oxide or styrene oxide substrate. Following a single dose of AAF (35 mg/kg), epoxide hydrolase activity was maximally increased (560% of control) within 48 h, and the activity declined slowly, with a halflife of 17.5 days. Co-treatment with actinomycin D effectively blocked the AAF dependent increase in epoxide hydrolase, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is associated with the increase in enzyme activity. Dose-response curves for epoxide hydrolase induction by AAF, N-hydroxy-2acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-AAF), and 2-aminofluorene were compared, and the potencies for increasing epoxide hydrolase activity reflected the relative hepatocarcinogenic potentials of these agents. In mice, which are resistant to the hepatocarcinogenic action of AAF and deficient in AAF-Nhydroxylase activity, AAF caused no significant increase in hepatic microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity. Similarly, in Cotton rats and guinea pigs, which are lacking in ability to form the sulfate conjugate of N-OH-AAF, neither i.p. nor dietary administration of AAF elicited increases in epoxide hydrolase activity at doses which were maximally effective in F-344 rats. These results support the hypothesis that the ability of compounds to increase epoxide hydrolase activity is related to their carcinogenic potency. Furthermore, the results suggest that increases in epoxide hydrolase activity are associated with metabolism of AAF to the putative proximate carcinogen N-OH-AAF, and the subsequent conversion of this compound to the N-O-sulfate conjugate.",

The elevation of epoxide hydrolase activity has been observed following treatment with a wide variety of hepatocarcinogens and is dose-related. Comparison of the slopes of the log-linear dose response curves for increases in epoxide hydrolase elicited by several hepatocarcinogens of diverse structure showed them to be similar, suggesting that the increases in epoxide hydrolase occur through a common mechanism. Furthermore, a correlation has been suggested between heaptocarcinogenic potency and potency in increasing epoxide hydrolase activity (1) .",

Purification of PN-antigen led to its identification as epoxide hydrolase (7, 8) . More recently, Lin et al. (9) suggested that PN-antigen and epoxide hydrolase are different proteins. While the relationship between PN-antigen and epoxide hydrolase remains to be resolved, it is evident that phenotypically altered foci of hepatocytes induced by chemical carcinogens contain elevated quantities of epoxide hydrolase (8) . Elevated quantities of epoxide hydrolase have been demonstrated immunocytochemically in hyperplastic nodules (10, 11) , and increased epoxide hydrolase activity has been observed in rats subjected to various promoting regimens for induction of hyperplastic nodules (12) and in several hepatomas (8, 13) .",

This reflects the hepatocarcinogenic potency of these compounds in these species (21, 23) . The strain and species differences in susceptibility to AAF-induced hepatocarcinogenesis have been attributed to variations in the metabolic activation of this compound. Guinea pigs are lacking in sulfotransferase activity, and also readily convert N-OH-AAF to 7-OH-2-acetylaminofluorene, which is inactive as a carcinogen (39) . Cotton rats possess 5 times the AAF-N-hydroxylase activity, 3 times the N-OH-AAF-deacetylase activity, but only 1/3 the N-OH-AAF-sulfotransferase activity of Sprague-Dawley rats (23) . It is probable that the lack of AAFdependent epoxide hydrolase induction observed in these animals is related to this altered pattern of AAF metabolism. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that formation of the N-O-sulfate conjugate of N-OH-AAF is necessary for epoxide hydrolase elevation by this compound. Mice possess very low levels of AAF-N-hydroxylase activity (22, 40) . The lack of epoxide hydrolase increase in response to AAF in this species is likely a reflection of the low rate of formation of N-OH-AAF.",

Effect of AD on the elevation of epoxide hydrolase activity by AAF. AAF (35 mg/kg) was administered to F-344 rats as a single oral dose dissolved in corn oil. AD (1 mg/kg in 1 ml/kg water containing 5% DMSO, i.p.) was administered 0.5 h before AAF treatment and repeated 10 h later. Control animals received corn oil alone. Rats were killed 24 benzo[alpyrene-4,5-diol formed/mg PMS protein/min. Mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3. Significantly different from control, p <0.05.",
