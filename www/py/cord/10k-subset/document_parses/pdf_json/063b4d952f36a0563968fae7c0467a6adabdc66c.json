The expression of functional MBL protein is largely genetically determined, with 3 common functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3 other mutations. The 3 common nonsynonymous SNPs are found in the codons 52, 54, and 57, which cause amino acid replacements, arginine-cysteine, glycine-aspartic acid, and glycine-glutamic acid, respectively, in the collagen domain altering its ability to oligomerize (the mutant forms).
