These viruses can be grown in a complementing cell line expressing the gH protein [4] . Viruses produced from the complementing cell line can infect normal cells, undergoing a single cycle of replication, but the virus particles emerging from these normal cells lack gH and are therefore noninfectious. Thus, this virus, which we have called a DISC (disabled infectious single cycle) virus, is similar to a traditional killed vaccine, in that being genetically inactivated, it cannot spread within the host. In other respects, however, it has the properties of a live vaccine, in that it should be capable of generating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against all virus-encoded antigens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 190, "end": 193, "text": "[I]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 316, "end": 319, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 320, "end": 322, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 407, "end": 410, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We have shown that DISC gH-deleted HSV-I can protect against HSV-I challenge in the mouse ear model.

However, since engineering of the genome can be done most efficiently using selectable marker genes, such as lacZ, whose expression can be recognized with a color-based assay (using the substrate X-gal), we designed a two-stage recombination procedure for deletion of the gH gene of HSV-2. During the first stage, the gH gene was replaced with the lacZ gene. The desired recombinant virus can be recognized because, in the presence of X-gal, it forms blue plaques against a background of white nonrecombinant plaques. The second stage of the procedure involved deleting the lacZ gene from the first-stage recombinant virus; this virus can be recognized as a white plaque against a background of blue plaques. Since it is generally difficult to identify single white plaques among a large number of blue plaques, we used a selection procedure using the tk gene to facilitate the second stage (figure 2). This took advantage of the fact that the tk gene lies adjacent to the gH gene on the HSV genome, and therefore, the first-stage vector could be The second-stage recombination vector (pIMMB46) was designed to reconstruct a functional tk gene within the virus genome, while simultaneously deleting the lacZ gene. We took the opportunity to insert in its place a short (28-bp) noncoding linker sequence that could provide a convenient \"tag\" for recognition of the final recombinant virus by nucleic acid hybridization or by restriction enzyme digestion. Second-stage recombinants could thus be selected on the basis that they could grow on gH+Itk-BHK cells in the presence ofmethotrexate; under these conditions, tk-HSV cannot replicate. Correctly configured recombinants should also form white plaques. The methotrexate selection step was higWy successful, increasing the percentage of white tk+ recombinants from \"'0.1% to 50%. Several plaques were picked and purified by plaquing and limiting dilution in CR2 cells.

Only a fraction of the particles in a virus preparation are infectious, so when a DISC virus preparation is administered directly to a mucosal surface, without trauma, a relatively small proportion of the particles may be available to trigger an immune response. This proportion may be much larger after sc inoculation of the vaccine. An alternative explanation could be that sc delivery allows more effective access to \"professional\" antigen-presenting cells and hence a more vigorous immune response.

Alternatively, the immune response stimulated by the vaccine may have been capable of controlling reactivated infection before the symptoms appeared. Both these mechanisms play a role in the observed protection against recurrent disease.

One is its potency. The lowest dose of vaccine used (10 4 pfu), which provided almost complete protection against primary disease, would represent only about 4 ng of virus, calculated on the basis of a particle-to-infectivity ratio of about 200. It is by no means certain that such low doses would be as effective in humans; nevertheless, the data are most encouraging. A second important element is the vaccine's ability to reduce substantially replication of challenge virus. From an epidemiologic perspective, it is considered highly desirable that an HSV vaccine should not only be able to prevent disease but also reduce virus shedding, as this should lead, over time, to a general reduction in disease prevalence even in unvaccinated persons. Third, the vaccine induced a durable immune response, resulting in complete protection against challenge even after 6 months. Long-lasting immunity will clearly be a crucial ingredient of a successful vaccine against HSV. The vaccine also provided strong and durable immunity to challenge even after just one dose. From a practical standpoint, the ability to induce effective protection with one vaccination would represent a considerable advantage.
