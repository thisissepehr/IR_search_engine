Endothelial damage and barrier disruption play critical roles in ARDS [3, 4] , which may cause decreased S1P production. Serum S1P levels are also dependent on the level of S1P carrier proteins. In the blood, S1P is predominantly associated with HDL-associated apolipoprotein M (apo M) and to a lesser extent with albumin [21, 22] . In ARDS, both HDL and albumin levels are decreased.

In our study, S1P levels correlated with the number of non-pulmonary organ failures, but they were not associated with ARDS severity according to the Berlin classification.
