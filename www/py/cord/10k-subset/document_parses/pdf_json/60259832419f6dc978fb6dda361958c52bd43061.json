The West Nile virus, originating from Uganda, was found in New York in 1999, and had spread to over 44 states by 2002; in 2003 and 2004, the West Nile virus had infected over 12000 people, killing 350(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/ westnile/). After battling schistosomiasis for many years along the Yangtze River Basin, many counties in China had the disease under control for some time.

For example, though the direct reason of SARS dispersal is due to human air travel, we have little understanding of its origin, transmission channel, and media. However, many other diseases are being carried around spatially by trade and tourism, but do not spread in their new environment. Therefore, we would like to ask which diseases will be spread around the globe successfully via globalization. What are their origins, destinations, and spreading channels? What is the likelihood of survival and endemics of a pathogen under new environment?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In order to answer those questions, we need to develop models that can predict the transmission of infectious diseases. We need to understand the history and current endemic region of an infectious disease. There are three stages in predicting the transmission of infectious diseases: (1) identification of the pathogen, its animal host, and its pathway of transmission among the hosts; (2) determining the spatial transmission pattern of each infectious disease, particularly the relationship between the distribution of the disease and its environment; (3) understanding the dynamic process of the transmission of the disease, using models calibrated with field survey data [1] . The epidemiological model thus established will have the capability to predict the dispersal of the virus, and its likelihood of transmission in new environment. However, each of these stages is difficult to complete. The work at stage one is a diagnosis and initial exploration of the disease. For a new virus, there is the possibility of important new discoveries.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 676, "end": 679, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The second stage involves the survey and quantitative description of the spatial and temporal pattern of an infectious disease, followed by an analysis of the relationship of the disease with its environment. Geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and statistical methods are most suitable to deal with the problems at this stage. Remotely sensed data provide us with information about the land cover, surface temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation growth. Such information is very useful in indirectly predicting the abundance of virus transmission vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks, mice and snails. GIS provides a spatial database containing environmental and epide-miological data. Such data provide a basis for statistical analysis. For example, with GIS one can explore the statistical relationship between infectious disease data and environmental data, and then map the risk level in the area of interest. Infection risk mapping is usually based on environmental suitability analysis. This is done by searching for the environment whose conditions meet the requirement of a particular infectious disease. There are four cases that can result from the comparison between suitability for and actual distribution of a particular disease: first, the actual distribution is located in the suitable area; second, the disease is found in unsuitable areas; third, the suitable area does not have the actual disease. Though the first and second cases are the most reasonable ones, the third should not be considered incorrect. Only when the distribution area is classified as an unsuitable area, is the third case incorrect. More can be done with GIS. For example, when examining the infection risk distribution of schistosomiasis, one can evaluate the spatial autocorrelation among different residential groups; such information is helpful in the spatial control of the disease transmission [2, 3] The third stage is based on the two previous stages. The goal is to establish a quantitative process based biological model. Such models can be calibrated with field measurements and surveys. In general, these models are limited to modeling the biological reproduction cycle of a particular disease, and relevant hosts [4] . However, there are also studies that directly model the dynamics between the environment and the transmission vector. For example, the relationship between the climate and mosquito populations can be modeled.

In this study we did not consider the migration of snails and eggs, because the active movement of snails is rather limited in space, and the eggs stored in stool are mostly accumulated by individual farmers and applied to their own fields near their house. The interaction of eggs between neighboring villages is limited. Passive movement of snails is usually caused by the transport of agricultural products, but their numbers are usually low. Therefore, we ignored this. The diagonal elements in S represent the retention rates of the villages. The retention rate, S ii , is related to the area and slope of the village. The calculation was done by setting an upper and lower bound (0.3-0.9), and by building a linear model of slope and area.

Xu et al. [14] attempted to construct a statistical relationship between field survey snail densities and land cover information derived from remote sensing data, producing a snail density for the entire study area. They used a 4-m resolution IKONOS multispectral imagery and a DEM derived from ASTER images, spatially densified into 4 m grids in a land cover classification. As a result, 16 land cover types were obtained (Fig. 6) . Field validation indicates that the average accuracy of this map is 89%. Classification accuracies of the major cover types such as residential areas, flood plains, crop areas, riverbeds, lowland terraces, high land terraces, and forest areas are all greater than 87%. The land cover types are intentionally schemed so that they are not sensitive to season. In this manner, it is possible to establish statistical relations with imagery obtained from different seasons for snail density estimation. In order to find out if detailed land cover information with such a classification scheme can be derived from remote sensing data at lower resolutions, the land cover data derived from the 4-m data were converted to fractional cover data based on an aggregation of 7\u00d77 pixels. We then applied a linear model to estimate snail density, where f is the fraction of area for a particular land cover type calculated from the 7\u00d77 pixel window; SA is the estimated snail density; and a's are the coefficients of the model. The snail density for each village was calculated. Using over 10,000 snail sampling points collected in the ditches from 19 villages, they found that the R 2 value between survey data and the estimation data could be as high as 0.87. Because it is very time and labor intensive for snail surveys in the field, we only did field surveys in the summer of 2001. We surveyed 19 villages for every ditch at 10 m intervals. At each sampling site, we placed a Kuang (0.11 m 2 ) to survey the snail density. A shortcoming of this experiment was that we did not have independent samples to validate our statistical model, since we used all the sampling data when building the multivariate statistical model in eq. (7). Additionally, snail density changes with season. Another shortcoming of this research was that we did not use satellite data from multiple times to estimate snail density variation in time. However, since the purpose of this study is mainly to test the feasibility of the conceptual model for spatial temporal dynamics simulation, this is sufficient. With eq.

Each infectious disease has its original endemic area. Its spatial transmission mainly relies on the natural forces, such as climate variation, vegetation succession, atmospheric and ocean circulation. Human activity promotes the transmission of infectious disease to new environments, by facilitating species invasion. Thus, human activity in the infectious disease transmission system acts as a positive feedback. We must have a better understanding of this positive feedback system, establish a better prediction model, and improve our prevention capacity. The model proposed in this study sheds lights on the spatio-temporal modeling of other infectious diseases. When the biological and environmental processes between the origin of the disease, its vector and host are relatively clear, we can adopt such models to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of an infectious disease. For example, the plague, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and lyme disease can be modeled using the conceptual framework proposed here.
