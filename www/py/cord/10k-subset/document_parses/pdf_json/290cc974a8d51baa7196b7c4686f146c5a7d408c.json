Here we report the first Sri Lankan case of T2 deficiency confirmed by genetic analysis. A 4-year-old boy presented with the first episode of severe metabolic ketoacidosis after a febrile illness. On admission, the child was drowsy and had circulatory collapse needing intubation. Initial investigations were not detective of a cause and symptomatic management did not improve the condition. During the acute episode, his urine organic acid profile revealed elevations in 3-OH-2-methylbutyric acid and tiglylglycine whilst 2-methylacetoacetic acid was not detected. The differential diagnoses for the urine organic acid profile included deficiency in T2 or 2-methyl-3-OH-butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase enzymes. Genetic analysis using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing of ACAT1 gene revealed that the proband is homozygous for the novel missense likely pathogenic variant c.152C [ T p.(Pro51Leu) confirming the diagnosis of T2 deficiency. This case highlights the importance of suspecting T2 deficiency in the differential diagnosis of pediatric metabolic ketoacidosis in preventing life threatening consequences of an otherwise benign disorder.",

T2 deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of less than one per 1,000,000 newborns (1] . Owing to diagnostic challenges and lack of awareness, many cases have been missed during their initial presentation [2] . It typically manifests between 6-18 months of age as acute and recurrent ketoacidotic episodes triggered by ketogenic stress [1, 2] . Patients are typically asymptomatic between episodes, and the episode frequency decreases with age [2] . The characteristic laboratory finding is the elevation of urine organic acids; tiglylglycine (TIG) 2-methylacetoacetic acid (2MAA) and 3-OH-2-methyl-butyric acid (2M3HB). More than 70 different mutations of the mitochondrial ACAT1 gene have been identified to date as causative for T2 deficiency [3] . Only one case of T2 deficiency has been reported from Sri Lanka, detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), but the diagnosis was not confirmed by genetic studies or enzyme analysis [4] . In this study, we report on the first Sri Lankan case of T2 deficiency confirmed by molecular analysis and characterize a novel mutation in ACAT1 gene.",

However, low levels of urine TIG does not exclude T2 deficiency, as mutations with retained residual activity (e.g. H144P mutation) can give rise to atypical urine organic acid profiles [6, 7] . This child's clinical outcome turned out to be a one with poor prognosis.
