Despite the magnitude of this disorder, the mech anisms leading to the apparent senescence-related glucose intolerance have yet to be elucidated. It is not clear if this phenomenon reflects aging per se or lifestyle (i.e., diet composition, physical activity, obesity, decreased lean body mass). The identification of specific mechanisms leading to the senescence-related glucose intolerance observed in humans has been hindered by the difficulty in controlling environ mental factors during the Ufe span. Conversely, small, short-lived rodents, such as mice and rats, provide the researcher with greater control of the environment, allow life-span studies and have been successfully used as models for human aging. Thus, we used mature (12 mo) and aged (24 mo) Sprague-Dawley rats, fed either a high-sucrose or sucrose-free diet, to evaluate the effects of aging and diet on skeletal muscle insulin-receptor function. Furthermore, the impact of exercise in combination with the high su crose diet was examined to determine if exercise would attenuate any alterations that might be demon strated with the high sucrose diet.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 897, "end": 904, "text": "(12 mo)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The association between age and attenuated in sulin-receptor function has been suggested by Sinha and Jenquin (2) , who reported a decline in the number of insulin receptors and, subsequently, insulin-stimu lated receptor function in hepatocytes isolated from adult compared with fetal and neonatal rat tissue. Trishitta and Reaven (3) examined insulin-receptor function in isolated adipocytes of Sprague-Dawley rats aged 2 and 12 mo and concluded that the older rats have a defect in the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake that may be reflected in alterations in insulin-receptor function. The relevance of the data of Trishitta and Reaven (3) to the study of senescence and whole body insulin sensitivity is unclear. That is, 12 mo represents less than half the median life-span of the Sprague-Dawley rat, and results may reflect maturation-rather than senescence-related altera tions. Furthermore, the adipocyte only accounts for a ' small percentage of glucose uptake in rats. Because skeletal muscle is responsible for the majority of the storage of excess blood glucose, we believe that evalu ation of this tissue's insulin-receptor function may provide a physiologically more relevant marker for insulin sensitivity than adipose tissue. Therefore, to more fully elucidate the effect of senescence on glucose tolerance, we examined skeletal muscle in sulin-receptor function of adult (12 mo) and aged (24 mo) rats as a marker of insulin sensitivity. After a 2-wk adaptation period to our colony condi tions (light cycle, temperature, etc.), younger and older rats were assigned to one of three groups: su crose diet (12 mo, S12;324 mo, S24), sucrose diet and exercised (12 mo, S-Exl2; 24 mo, S-Ex24), and su crose-free diet (12 mo, SF12; 24 mo, SF24).

As stated previously, no significant main effect of diet was demonstrated at any of the sampling periods. The inverse relationship between insulin-receptor function and serum glucose and insulin concentrations observed in these rats may reflect the length of time the rats were fed the high sucrose diet. We chose a 4-mo feeding protocol to determine long-term changes in glucose metabolism rather than transient alterations. Gutman and col leagues (27) demonstrated that metabolic alterations in glucose tolerance and triglyc\u00c3\u00a9ride synthesis in re sponse to a high sucrose diet are multiphasic and result in the greatest decline in glucose tolerance during the first 22 d of the diet, with an attenuated effect on glucose tolerance thereafter. Therefore, the alterations in skeletal muscle insulin receptors may represent long-term adaptations to the high sucrose diet that persist beyond the initial alterations in glucose tolerance. These data are consistent with those of McDonald (28) , who reported that in travenous glucose tolerance tests did not differ be tween 12-and 26-mo-old male Sprague-Dawley rats fed the same sucrose and sucrose-free diets as those in . ing affinity of centration of b imal tyrosine ! vity of tyrosini the present study. Exercise seemed to prevent the decline in skeletal muscle insulin-receptor function in both the 12-and 24-mo-old animals. It is possible that the exercise prevented the increase in adiposity seen in the 24-mo-old compared with the 12-mo-old animals which may, in turn, prevent the decrease in insulinreceptor number. The older rats also initially decreased food intake in response to exercise, which may also account for the changes observed. When rats are not allowed to become obese, the decline in in sulin sensitivity previously observed is prevented (29) . The role of exercise in the younger animals seemed to be one of increasing responsiveness to insulin due to the training effect observed in these animals.

In both the 12-and 24-mo-old animals, minor decreases in insulin-receptor function were demonstrated in the sucrose-fed sedentary groups. The decreases observed were prevented when exercise accompanied the sucrose diet. This indicates that exercise may be involved in the prevention of insulin insensitivity in both young adult and aged adult animals. These alterations, however, were not accompanied by changes in plasma glucose or insulin, indicating that the alterations in skeletal muscle in sulin receptor may have marginal functional signifi cance.
