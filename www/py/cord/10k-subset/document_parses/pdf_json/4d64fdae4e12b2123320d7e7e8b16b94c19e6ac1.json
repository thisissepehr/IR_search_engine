However, extensive empirical research indicates that real networked systems also display ubiquitous degree correlations. In this paper, we address the trapping issue on the Koch networks, which is a special random walk with one trap fixed at a hub node. The Koch networks are power-law with the characteristic exponent \u2425 in the range between 2 and 3, they are either assortative or disassortative. We calculate exactly the MFPT that is the average of first-passage time from all other nodes to the trap. The obtained explicit solution shows that in large networks the MFPT varies lineally with node number N, which is obviously independent of \u2425 and is sharp contrast to the scaling behavior of MFPT observed for uncorrelated random scale-free networks, where \u2425 influences qualitatively the MFPT of trapping problem.",

Recent work shows that the key quantity-mean first-passage time (MFPT) for random walks to a given hub node (node with highest degree) on uncorrelated random scale-free networks-is qualitatively reliant on the heterogeneity of network structure. However, in addition to the power-law behavior, most real systems are also characterized by degree correlations. In this paper, we study random walks on a family of recently proposed networks-Koch networks that are transformed from the well-known Koch curves and have simultaneously powerlaw degree distribution and degree correlations with the power exponent of degree distribution lying between 2 and 3. We explicitly determine the MFPT, i.e., the average of first-passage time to a target hub node averaged over all possible starting positions, and show that the MFPT varies linearly with node number, independent of the inhomogeneity of network structure. Our result indicates that the heterogeneous structure of Koch networks has little impact on the scaling of MFPT in the network family, which is in contrast with the result of MFPT previously reported for uncorrelated stochastic scale-free graphs.",

It is known that the exponent \u2425 characterizing the inhomogeneity of networks affects qualitatively the scaling of MFPT for diffusion in random uncorrelated scale-free networks. 28 Concretely, in random uncorrelated scale-free networks with large order N, the MFPT F\u0351N\u0352 grows sublinearly or linearly with network order as F\u0351N\u0352\u03f3N \u0351\u2425\u22122\u0352/\u0351\u2425\u22121\u0352 for all \u2425 \u03fe 2, which strongly depends on \u2425. However, as shown above, in the whole family of Koch networks, the MFPT displays a linear dependence on network order, which is independent of \u2425, showing that the inhomogeneity of structure has no quantitative impact on the scaling behavior of MFPT for trapping process in Koch networks.

            "text": "Power-law degree distribution and degree correlations play a significant role in the collective dynamical behaviors on scale-free networks. In this paper, we have investigated the trapping issue, concentrating on a particular case with the trap fixed on a node with highest degree on the Koch networks that display synchronously a heavy-tailed degree distribution with general exponent \u2425 \u03532,3\u0354 and degree correlations. We obtained explicitly the formula for MFPT to the trapping node, which scales lineally with network order, independent of the exponent \u2425. Our result shows that structural inhomogeneity of the Koch networks has no essential effect on the scaling of MFPT for the trapping issue, which departs a little from that one expects and is as compared with the scaling behavior reported for stochastic uncorrelated scalefree networks. Thus, caution must be taken when making a general statement about the dependence of MFPT for trapping issue on the inhomogeneous structure of scale-free networks. Finally, it should be also mentioned that both random uncorrelated networks and the Koch networks addressed here cannot well describe real systems, future work should focus ",
