However, it is often unknown when during development and under which conditions alterations occur in the respiratory system or the control of breathing (27) . Also among inbred wild type strains the control of respiration differs substantially, e.g., the C57BL/6-strain was classi\u00deed as highly responsive to hypercapnia, whereas the DBA/2-strain was highly responsive to hypoxia (51) . Therefore, in these animals mechanical ventilation offers the possibility to study effect of differences in genetic background independent of changes in ventilation. Second, the \u00d2surgical\u00d3 indication: certain surgical procedures have an improved outcome or can only be performed with support of mechanical ventilation.

In early studies using a mechanical ventilator with active in-and expiration for mice (28) , the airway was accessed by advancing a tube through the mouth into the pharynx, but not further into the trachea. Although technically less demanding than endotracheal intubation, this attempt risked gastric gas-insufflation (including aspiration of stomach content) and did not provide PEEP capability. A different, nontraumatizing mode to access the airways is performed with the Brady-Newsom apparatus (3): it consists of a gas-chamber around the murine head, sealed at the thorax by a tight neoprenecollar. Elevating the pressure in this chamber leads to increased airway pressures, with respect to ambient air. Thus this concept provides continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if the mouse ventilates spontaneously, or mechanical ventilation, if periodic pressure changes in the chamber are generated. Although this apparatus has advantages, e.g., the technically less demanding airway access, it is also hampered with the disadvantage of gastic gas insufflation and aspiration of gastric content. To circumvent this problem, mechanical ventilation of mice today is usually performed after securing the airways by orotracheal intubation or via tracheotomy and consecutive endotracheal intubation. Tracheotomy has been performed in preterm neonate mice (1.15 g bodyweight) with insertion of polyethylene tubes (SP8, Natsume, Tokyo, Japan; tapered 0.4 mm outer diameter (OD)) (30), whereas for adult mice the OD of the endotracheal tube ranges from 0.9 mm (25\u00d038 g mice) (29) to 1.1 mm (20\u00d035 g mice) (15) . For experiments requiring recovery after surgery, temporary orotracheal intubation is performed, ideally via direct laryngoscopy with a purpose-made laryngoscope (13) . The visualization of relevant airway structures requires a strong small-focus light-source, allowing transillumination of the laryngeal cavity (with vocal cords and tracheal ori\u00dece), when put on the ventral cervical region from the outside (2). Orotracheal intubation is performed with or without visual con\u00dermation of the tube\u00d5s tip-position (tube position judged by respiratory excursions). Visualization of the trachea (after surgical access to the deeper cervical structures) and controlled advancement of the endotracheal tube allows more accurate positioning of the tube, but is more invasive and has therefore an increased morbidity and mortality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 171, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1686, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1855, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Airway access in mice"}, {"text": "For animals sacri\u00deced at the end of the experiment, direct surgical access to the airways is an alternative option. Since most of our mouse surgeries require preparation of deeper cervical structures (e.g., catherization of a carotid artery and jugular vein) performing tracheotomies is convenient, with the additional advantage of minimized dead space (Vd). A reliable surgical procedure for this airway access is brie\u00dfy described: after induction of anesthesia the mouse is put into the supine position and the head is reclined (silk or rubber band around the upper incision teeth and attached to the operating surface) to allow easy access to the ventral neck. A median cerival skin incision (upper thorax aperture to lower jaw) is performed and layerwise skin, fascia, fat and connective tissue covering the thyroid gland are removed. The thyroid lobes are divided bluntly at their isthmus, pulled aside and kept retracted by bulldogclamps. The pretracheal muscles are spread bluntly and pulled aside to allow access to larynx and trachea. Tracheotomy is performed by a transversal cut between two tracheal rings, usually in the lower third of the trachea. For the endotracheal intubation vascular PE-catheters (Abbocath-T\u00a8, Abbott-Venisystems) are used, cut to a length of about 5 mm with an angled tip (45\u00a1) to allow smooth introduction. The correct position of the endotracheal tube is con\u00dermed by judging chest excursions, e.g., if respiration is still visible and symmetric. The tube is secured by ligation (silk 6-0, Davis & Geck\u00a8) around the trachea. If maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is desired, the endotracheal tube is shortened to minimize Vd and airway resistance. For mechanical ventilation, initially applied RR and/or Vt should be sufficiently higher than spontaneous RR and Vt of the anesthetized mouse to decrease respiratory drive (e.g., \u00d2breathing against the ven-tilator\u00d3) by moderate hyperventilation. After connecting the endotracheal tube, anesthesia can be safely deepened for an additional depression of ventilatory drive and facilitation of mechanical ventilation. Alternatively, this goal can be achieved (avoiding additional cardiocirculatory depression) by a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (vecuronium-bromid 0.25 mg\u00e1kg \u00d01 bodyweight i.p., Norcuron\u00a8, Organon).

However, these mixed modes are not largely established for mice yet, and will therefore not discussed in detail.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 450, "end": 453, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanical ventilation of mice"}, {"text": "Although mechanical ventilation of mice has major advantages, it is confounded by difficulties: obviously, the small size of the animals makes airway access more challenging than in other laboratory animals. For example, in 25\u00d030 g mice, the trachea has an accessible length of only 3\u00d05 mm and a circumference of about 2.5 mm (49) . Appropriate endotracheal tubes have an outher diameter ranging from 0.4 mm for neonate mice (30) to 1.0 mm for adult mice (13) . The actual mechanical ventilation of the mouse is complicated by the technically demanding respiratory pattern of this species, e.g., the high RR, the low Ti/Tt ratio and the small Vt, with the latter also demanding a minimized deadspace (Vd) to prevent rebreathing. In commercially available rodent ventilators, the relatively large system-Vd allows substantial gas compression, thereby minimizing the Vt delivered to the mouse. Ewart et al. (11) reported that 2 ml of added Vd (complianc\u1ebd 0.002 ml/cmH 2 O) and a peak inspiratory pressure of 40 cm H 2 O reduce the delivered Vt by about 50 %. Thus, mouse ventilators (see Table 2 ) should have a range of technical modalities to enable proper murine ventilation. Since some authors did not report on the type of ventilator used (see Table  3 ) the list might be incomplete. The most obvious difference between spontaneous respiration and usual modes of mechanical ventilation (MV) are inverted pressure relations, with respect to ambient pressure, during the respiratory cycle: during spontaneous inspiration the expansion of the intrathoracic volume (mainly caused by contraction of the diaphragm and extension of the rib cage) generates a negative intrathoracic pressure and allows gas \u00dfow into the lungs. During expiration mainly passive elastic forces of lung and rib cage generate a positive intrathoracic pressure, leading to exhalation of air. Applying usual MV, the air is pushed during inspiration into the mice\u00d5s lungs, leading to a positive intrathoracic pressure. During expiration intrathoracic pressure equilibrates with ambient pressure (intermittent positive pressure ventilation, IPPV) or remains positive (continuous positive pressure ventilation, CPPV). Therefore it is important to notice that mean airway pressure during mechanical ventilation is higher than during spontaneous ventilation. These higher pressures contribute to side effects induced by mechanical ventilation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 330, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 455, "end": 459, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 905, "end": 909, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1086, "end": 1093, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1255, "text": "Table  3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Mechanical ventilation of mice"}, {"text": "Mechanical ventilators are classified according to their method of cycling between the inspiratory and expiratory phases.

However, although the method of cycling is classi\u00deed according to a single parameter (e.g., time), some mouse respirators allow a more sophisticated control of the ventilation by limiting relevant parameters: to prevent high inspiratory peak airway pressures, for example, most mouse ventilators allow the limitation of the ventilatory system pressure. Most commercial mouse ventilators are time cycled and pressure limited.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanical ventilation of mice"}, {"text": "The primary goal of mechanical ventilation is delivery of an adequate respiratory minute-volume (Ve) to the murine 514 Basic Research in Cardiology, Vol. 95, No. 6 (2000) \u00a9 Steinkopff Verlag 2000 lung. To achieve this, the RR and Vt have to be adjusted to supply the actual ventilatory requirements. RR in most mouse ventilators is the preset cycling parameter, but Vt-lung may vary, depending on the compliance of lungs and tubing and whether respiration is pressure limited. A decrease in compliance of the respiratory system, for example in murine models of interstitial pulmonary diseases (ARDS, pneumonia), increases the airway pressure for a given Vt ventilator . If ventilation is pressure limited, then VT lung will be considerably less than Vt ventilator . In contrast, if higher peak pressures are accepted to maintain Vt lung , the risk to traumatize the delicate murine lung will increase (17) . To prevent the occurrence of these high pressures, inspiration time relative to expiration can be increased for a given Vt (up to inverse ratio ventilation (IRV), with inspiration longer than expiration). Disadvantages of a higher inspiratory fraction during mechanical ventilation are possibly insufficient times for complete exhalation (\u00d2air trapping\u00d3) and the prolonged phases of elevated intrathoracic pressure, which may cause a decreased cardiac preload and consequently lowered blood pressures (7). A feature provided by some mouse-ventilators is the possible application of external positive end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEP): during expiration, airway pressure is not allowed to equilibrate with ambient pressure (0 cmH 2 O), but kept at a higher level (usually 2\u00d010 cmH 2 O). Mechanical ventilation with PEEP prevents the endexpiratory collapse of small airways and possibly recruits atelectatic pulmonary areas for gas exchange by increase of functional residual capacity (FRC). Since pulmonary compliance increases (up to a certain degree) with increased FRC, ventilation with PEEP supports pulmonary in\u00dfation. Whether this holds true for mice has not been shown yet. Additionally, ventilation with PEEP might mimic the physiologic end-expiratory tonus of inspiratory muscles and glottis of spontaneous ventilating mice (56) .

With respect to this, we have developed an integrated endotracheal tube within a small aluminum frame (10 x 5 x 2 mm, 5 g), consisting of temperature controlled adapters for in-and expiratory tubing, an inline-capnography cell (Vd = 25 \u00b5l) and a liquid-filled airway-pressure transducer. Although airway pressures are usually monitored to maintain safe values for mean-and peak-airway pressure, this measure can also serve to titrate damage in murine models of respirator-induced lung impairment, such as baro-or volutrauma (17) , where tidal volumes (Vt) have been adjusted to achieve traumatizing target airway pressures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1342, "end": 1346, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Airway pressures"}, {"text": "Fresh-gas in\u00dfow composition to the mechanical ventilator can be monitored with respect to the concentrations of the different respiratory gases, e.g., oxygen (O 2 ), nitrogen (N 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and volatile anesthetics. When rebreathing of exhaled air is excluded in the ventilatory circuit, analysis of fresh gas streaming to the respirator should accurately re\u00dfect the composition of inspiratory gases. This attempt is advantageous, compared to sample lines attached to the inspiratory tubing-limb of the system, because it circumvents the need for gas extraction from the inspiratory tubing with the consequence of decreased inspiratory airways-pressures and ventilatory tidal volumes. The actual measurement can be performed online with commercially available multi-gas analyzers (Datex\u00a8, HP\u00a8). It has been argued that ventilation with room air may not be ideal in mice (24) , based on observed high murine P 50 values (PO 2 corresponding to 50 % hemoglobin saturation) of 65 mmHg (46) or even 71 mmHg (48) . However, most studies have found a P 50~ 40 mmHg for the mouse, when measured under standard conditions (pH = 7.4, PCO 2 = 40 mmHg, 37 \u00a1C) (25, 31, 35, 42, 47) . A P 50 of ~ 40 mmHg is still rightshifted, when compared to humans (P 50 = 28 mmHg). Nevertheless, although even with a high P 50~ 65 mmHg blood is virtually 100 % saturated at room air (46) , increased FiO 2 may be helpful in the mouse when uncertainty exists whether mechanical ventilation optimally expands the lungs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 885, "end": 889, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1000, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1021, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1167, "text": "(25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1171, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1175, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1179, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1183, "text": "47)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1376, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Partial pressures of gasses"}, {"text": "If volatile anesthetics (halothane, en\u00dfurane, iso\u00dfurane or more recent ones such as sevo\u00dfurane and des\u00dfurane) are used, additional considerations have to be taken into account: clinically used vaporizers for volatile anesthetics (Draeger\u00a8, series 19) are usually precalibrated for gas \u00dfows higher than that required for mice and will therefore give unreliable results when used with low gas \u00dfows. Although recalibration of the vaporizer for low air-\u00dfow is the best option, a more common approach is to use an appropriate high gas\u00dfow (several hundred ml\u00e1min \u00d01 ) with the abundant air released via a T-type adapter or valve.

Although the arterial blood gas analysis is regarded as the gold standard for evaluation of proper ventilation, the drawbacks are that it is a discontinuous and invasive method requiring a substantial vol-ume of arterial blood (0.1\u00d00.2 ml for a single measurement, 5\u00d010 % of the total blood volume of a 25 g mouse (58)), the latter aspect adding new sources of instability to the model. Though often neglected, measurement of respiratory carbon dioxide concentration (capnography) is therefore recommended in mouse research. Especially the determination of the end-tidal CO 2 (etCO 2 ), as a measure for alveolar CO 2 -concentration, is described as essential to maintain stable physiological parameters during mechanical mouse ventilation (7) . However, capnography has rarely been performed in mice due to technical difficulties, like gas dilution artifacts occurring in side stream systems, which prevent accurate detection of endtidal CO 2 -peaks or-plateaus. Therefore, to use the potential of capnography to its full extent, fast responding mainstreamcapnography is required. To this end we have developed an integrated mouse endotracheal tube with an implemented capnography-cell with minimal gas-mixing artifacts. Since this cell is located in the endotracheal tube it allows real-time in-and expiratory mainstream breath-by-breath capnography.

Resuscitation is performed by rapid infusion of 0.2 ml albumin solution (white arrow), which increased capnography values back to baseline, probably by restoring pulmonary perfusion.

A typical example for a ventilator-induced regional side effect is the mechanical hyperin\u00dfation of the murine lung, e.g., when large tidal volumes or high airway pressures are applied.
