In this series of investigations, isoprinosine was evaluated in 11 viral infections, including representatives of the herpesvirus, picornavirus, rhabdovirus, myxovirus, poxvirus, and coronavirus groups in five different species of experimental animals. It should be noted that these studies were directed toward defining potential efficacy and determining whether the initial enthusiasm for this compound could be substantiated. Evaluation of the pharmacologic properties of the drug, therefore, were beyond the scope of this study. However, no toxicity was recognized in any of the animal models studied. Criteria for evaluating toxicity were deaths or clinical appearance of intoxication in control animals treated with the drug alone, alteration of white blood cell counts or development of fever in cats, and suppression of immune response or development of fever in pigs. Because of limited quantities of the compound, in-vivo studies of toxicity were not carried out with increasing doses in any of the laboratories. However, it should be noted that the drug did display some deleterious effects in the ciliary activity of mouse-tracheal explants. As little as 0.1 ug/ml was as inhibitory to ciliary activity as was infection with influenza virus. The results of this series of investigations are certainly disappointing. We could detect no evidence of a significant antiviral effect in 10 of the 11 model systems in animals. The one exception was the moderate protection observed in the dermal infection of rabbits with fibroma virus. In this model, treatment with 300 mg of isoprinosine/kg resulted in a decrease in the size of the lesions, although ultimately the rate of recovery was identical in treated and control animals. When 600 mg/kg was utilized, however, total suppression was observed. Thus, fibroma virus was the only agent in which therapeutic efficacy could be documented.
