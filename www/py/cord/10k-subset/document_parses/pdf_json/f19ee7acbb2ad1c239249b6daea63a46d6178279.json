The ethical and decision-making framework ultimately developed is based on the idea that there are numerous ethically relevant dimensions upon which any given case of GOFR can fare better or worse (as opposed to there being necessary conditions that are either satisfied or not satisfied, where all must be satisfied in order for a given case of GOFR to be considered ethically acceptable): research imperative, proportionality, minimization of risks, manageability of risks, justice, good governance (i.e., democracy), evidence, and international outlook and engagement. Rather than drawing a sharp bright line between GOFR studies that are ethically acceptable and those that are ethically unacceptable, this framework is designed to indicate where any given study would fall on an ethical spectrum-where imaginable cases of GOFR might range from those that are most ethically acceptable (perhaps even ethically praiseworthy or ethically obligatory), at one end of the spectrum, to those that are most ethically problematic or unacceptable (and thus should not be funded, or conducted), at the other. The aim should be that any GOFR pursued (and/or funded) should be as far as possible towards the former end of the spectrum.",

Proportionality The ethical acceptability of extraordinarily risky GOFR partly depends on the extent to which there is reasonable expectation that the research White Paper-Gain-of-Function Research: Ethical Analysis 925 in question will (1) yield answers to the target public health question and (2) ultimately result in benefits that outweigh risks involved. 3. Minimization of Risks Other things being equal, the ethical acceptability of a GOFR study is a function of the degree to which (1) there is confidence that no less risky forms of research would be equally beneficial and (2) reasonable steps have been made to minimize risks of the GOFR study in question. 4. Manageability of Risks Other things being equal, the more manageable the risks of a GOFR study, the more ethically acceptable the study would be. Conversely, the more important/beneficial a GOFR study is expected to be, the more we should be willing to accept potentially unmanageable risks. 5. Justice Because justice requires fair sharing of benefits and burdens, the ethical acceptability of GOFR partly depends on the degree to which (1) risks fall on some people more than others, (2) risks fall on those who are unlikely to benefit, and/or (3) any resulting harms are uncompensated. 6. Good Governance-Democracy GOFR decision-and policy-making should (insofar as possible) reflect the ultimate values, value weightings, and risktaking strategies of public citizens. 7. Evidence Decision-and policy-making regarding GOFR should be based on more/better evidence regarding risks, benefits, (means of) risk minimization, who is likely to benefit or be harmed by research, and the values, value weightings, and risk-taking strategies of public citizens. 8. International Outlook and Engagement Because risks and benefits of GOFR (can) affect the global community at large, the ethical acceptability of GOFR partly depends on the extent to which it is accepted internationally. Decisionand policy-making regarding GOFR should (insofar as possible) involve consultation, negotiation, coordination, and related forms of active engagement with other countries.",

This research addressed an important scientific question-i.e., Might it be possible for H5N1 to naturally evolve into a human-to-human transmissible strain and thus result in a pandemic?and (purportedly) yielded an affirmative answer. After the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) initially recommended that these studies should be published in a redacted form (i.e., including key findings, while omitting detailed description of materials and methods), it later approved publication of revised versions in full, and the papers were published in 2012. Advocates of these studies/publications argued that they would improve surveillance of H5N1 in nature (facilitating early identification of, and thus better response to, the emergence of potential pandemic strains) and facilitate development of vaccines that might be needed to protect against pandemic strains of the virus. Critics questioned the validity of claims about such benefits and argued that the studies might facilitate creation of biological weapons agents that could kill millions, or possibly even billions, of people.",

Even when authored by scholars from other disciplines, furthermore, most of the existing ethically relevant GOFR literature is neither explicitly focused on ethics (e.g., using the language of 'ethics' in titles, abstracts, or key words) nor published in (bio)ethics journals. On the other hand, much of the literature surrounding GOFR controversy is (largely) implicitly concerned with ethics (whether or not the language of 'ethics' is front and center) insofar as normative considerations, values, questions about how to weigh risks/harms against benefits, and questions about ''what ought to be done''-all of which fall squarely within the domain of ethics-are of central concern.

Due to space constraints, the following does not aim to comprehensively cover literature concerned with dual-use life science research more generally-or even the controversial ferret H5N1 studies mentioned above, unless 'gain-of-function research' is explicitly mentioned-except insofar as the papers in question are directly relevant to risk-benefit analysis and/or the ethical-and decision-making framework parts of this paper. Much of the explicitly ethical literature concerned with dual-use life science research more generally, including the ferret H5N1 studies (prior to framing in terms of 'gain-of-function research'), are largely concerned with the ethical responsibilities of scientists and/or issues of censorship which are beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses on the shift in debate (towards biosafety and risk-benefit analysis) that occurred with framing in terms of 'gain-of-function research'.",

In light of Ron Fouchier's claim that the ferret-transmissible strain of H5N1 he produced is ''probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make'' (Enserink 2011) and (previous) NSABB chair Paul Keim's claim that ''I can't think of another pathogenic organism as scary as this one [created by Fouchier's team] \u2026 I don't think anthrax is scary at all compared to this'' (Enserink 2011) , for example, some critics argued that the study in question should have been, and/or that future similar research should be, conducted in laboratories with the highest bio-containment level-i.e., biosafety level 4 (BSL-4), as opposed to BSL-3 (''enhanced'') in which this research was done (Swazo 2013 (Fauci 2012, p. 1) . Additional biosafety concerns involve potential dangers associated with proliferation of GOFR, which is arguably likely to occur as more similar work is conducted/published. Whether or not GOFR has been adequately safe to date, similar future research might be conducted in suboptimal conditions-e.g., in countries/institutions with weaker infrastructure and/or research oversight systems (Evans et al. 2015; Fauci 2012; Gronvall 2014; Lipsitch and Galvani 2014; Wain-Hobson 2014) . Part of the resistance to insistence that additional similar research be conducted in BSL-4, on the other hand, is that this might unnecessarily increase expense, reduce efficiency, and/or inequitably deem relevant research impermissible in less wealthy countries (Lipkin 2012) .",

Part of the concern here, hopefully to be addressed by the deliberative process initiated by the US Government, is the perception (at least in the eyes of some) that much of the relevant debate and/or decision-making to date has been dominated by a limited subset of the scientific community and/or by people or parties with potential conflicts of interest. Because the potential risks and benefits of GOFR affect the public at large, it has been argued that more public input to debate and decision-making is necessary-the idea being that it is ethically problematic for some (e.g., scientists) to be making decisions and taking actions that impose serious risks on others (i.e., members of the general public) without consent of, or adequate input from, the latter. Furthermore, because the consequences of GOFR are ultimately global in nature (i.e., GOFR conducted in one country can have risks and benefits for those living in other countries), many have emphasized the importance of greater international engagement, which is necessary to promote harmonization of GOFR governance. While it is widely accepted that expert scientific opinion is essential to well-informed GOFR decisionand policy-making, there have been calls for input from a wider range of scientific disciplines. Jonathan Suk and colleagues (2014) , for example, argue that greater engagement with public health experts would facilitate both (1) assessment of GOFR risks and benefits and (2) design of GOFR studies that would have better translation into public health policy and practice. Many of these points are captured by the following statement of David Relman:",

Purported benefits of publication were that this would facilitate (1) development/production of vaccines against pandemic strains of the virus and (2) surveillance enabling early identification of, and thus response to, pandemic strains that might occur naturally. Critics have argued that such benefits are limited, inter alia, because naturally occurring pandemic strains may turn out be different from those created via the studies in question (in which case production of vaccines for, or surveillance targeting of, the latter might not be very useful); international surveillance systems are too weak ''to detect a pandemic viral sequence \u2026 before it is too late'' (Lipsitch and Galvani 2014, p. 3); ''an important lesson learnt from pandemic H1N1 (swine flu) is that there is not much that can be done to contain outbreaks of pandemic strains of influenza once they emerge'' (i.e., so early identification via surveillance might not make much difference) (Selgelid 2013, p. 148) ; and, given the way the vaccine industry actually works, there is unlikely to be development/stockpiling of vaccines against naturally-occurring transmissible strains of influenza before such strains actually arise (Selgelid 2013) . Lipsitch and Alison Galvani (2014) have additionally disputed the suggestion that these studies answered important public health questions-i.e., whether H5N1 might mutate into a human transmissible strain and what kinds of mutations might make this possible-in light of general difficulties translating ferret findings to humans (i.e., we cannot be sure that a strain of influenza transmissible in ferrets would be transmissible in humans) and complexities regarding epistasis (i.e., the phenotypic effects of any given mutation may depend on the broader genetic background of the organism in question; the same mutation may have different effects in different strains of a pathogen). In response to the point about translatability of ferret research to humans, Imperiale and Casadevall (2015) have responded that if this is a reason to be skeptical about benefits then it is also a reason to be skeptical about risks associated with the research in question.",

Whether or not theoretically possible benefits of any given study White Paper-Gain-of-Function Research: Ethical Analysis 933 are realized, according to Evans, will depend on background institutional factors (e.g., strength of healthcare infrastructure(s), systems of surveillance and countermeasure production, political will and resources necessary to translate scientific findings into benefits) that may or may not exist and/or may vary widely from country to country (Evans 2013 (Evans , 2014a Evans et al. 2015) . This last point highlights justice implications of GOFR-i.e., because some (people or countries) will be better able to protect against risks and/or realize benefits from GOFR than others. Alta Charo, for example, argues that: the benefits [of GOFR] will disproportionately go to people who are either personally better off or in wealthier countries because that is often where the healthcare system or economic access to healthcare is better. We need to pay more attention to making sure that the benefits are justly distributed and the science is beneficial for everybody (NRC and IOM 2015, p. 66 ).",

Acknowledging that potential benefits of advances in scientific knowledge may be long term-and difficult to predict ahead of time-they nonetheless maintain that GOFR benefits in the way of knowledge production should be taken into consideration, and not underestimated, in risk-benefit analysis of GOFR. Evans (2014a) concurs that scientific knowledge is valuable, but argues that appropriately factoring scientific knowledge advancement into risk-benefit analysis requires clarity regarding whether or not, or the extent to which, knowledge should be considered intrinsically valuable (i.e., valuable for its own sake) as opposed to merely instrumentally valuable (i.e., valuable only insofar as it promotes realization of other things of intrinsic value).",

While Lipsitch and co-authors advocate quantitative GOFR risk-benefit analysis, they emphasize the importance of assessing GOFR studies ''on the basis of their marginal benefits, compared to those of safer approaches'' (the idea being that any increased risks must be outweighed by increased benefits in order for GOFR studies to be justified) (Lipsitch and Galvani 2014, p. 5 ).",

A widely acknowledged limitation of RBA is that confidence in predictions generated depends upon the quality of (1) input data and (2) models employed in assessment of risks and benefits. 3 Both data and models will inevitably be imperfect in the context of GOFR in light of scenario complexity, uncertainties, unknown unknowns, and presumably unknowable unknowns, that are relevant to GOFR consequences. The likelihood and magnitude of harms that could result from GOFR, for example, partly depend upon the actions of malevolent actors. There are innumerable possible actions that such actors might take, however-and the likelihood of any given action and/or the consequences thereof (given all the relevant factors involved) are arguably inestimable (Posner 2004) . In some cases the commissioned RBA will aim to provide qualitative rather than quantitative analysis-precisely because the latter will not always be feasible. At the September 2015 meeting of the NSABB, Rocco Casagrande (Managing Director of Gryphon Scientific, which has been commissioned to complete the RBA currently underway) explained that assessment of potential benefits of GOFR (e.g., regarding countermeasure development) will be qualitative rather than quantitative because there is inadequate data for the latter (Casagrande 2015) . 4 RBA will, despite challenges noted above, hopefully provide the best assessments possible, acknowledging limitations regarding both quantitative and qualitative findings-and this would provide valuable input to decision-making processes. It is better to make informed rather than uninformed policy decisions regarding GOFR-and we can only inform ourselves to the best of our ability. To the degree that findings are uncertain (because based on imperfect data, estimates, and/or models), however, they may need to be considered with caution.",

Whether or not benefits outweigh risks, or vice versa, ultimately depends on whether there is (expected to be) net gain or loss of that which is intrinsically (or ultimately) valuable. To itself provide a clear guide to action, RBA would thus need to quantify or otherwise assess ultimate implications of GOFR regarding that which is intrinsically (or ultimately) valuable. Many of the benefits and risks to be evaluated by RBA are presumably merely instrumentally valuable. Medical countermeasures, surveillance, and economic gains, for example, are arguably largely valuable not for their own sakes but in virtue of the role they play in protecting and/or promoting human well being (in the way of public health). 6 Presumably almost everyone will agree that human well being (in the way of public health) is one of the things that ultimately matters for its own sake, and thus one of the things that policy should ultimately aim to promote. 7 The nature of other values associated with potential risks and benefits of GOFR, on the other hand, might not be so clear. There may be reasonable disagreement, for example, about whether the gain of scientific knowledge is merely instrumentally valuable, or also valuable for its own sake (Kitcher 2001; Evans 2014a) . Similar things might be said about the value of security, which looms large in debates about GOF research. Policy debates about dual use research more generally have often been framed in terms of potential conflict, and/or the need to strike a balance, between the value of security, on the one hand, and the value of scientific progress, and the good things thereby enabled, on the other. In its Framework for Conducting Risk and Benefit of Gain-of-Function Research NSABB (2015) has recommended that the RBA contractor consider the security implications of the kinds of risks and benefits enumerated above. Conceived as the ''protection of valuable things against loss'' (Selgelid 2012), security can be considered a meta-value. Protection of valuable things against loss can include both protection of instrumentally valuable things against loss and protection of intrinsically valuable things against loss. In the latter case, the value of security pertains to the good of society writ large. Among other things, the ultimate good of society arguably consists in (aggregate) human well being, liberty, equality, and our democratic way of life. All of these values could potentially be compromised by pandemic risks that GOFR might reduce or exacerbate. While security (conceived as protection of such things against loss) is thus especially important, there might be reasonable disagreement about whether or not, or the extent to which, security is intrinsically valuable, or merely valuable insofar as it plays a role in promoting such things. This is an important (rather than merely academic) matter because it raises the question of whether or not, or the extent to which, it would be legitimate to make net sacrifices of (other things of) intrinsic value in order to gain more security. 8 Part of the purpose of the discussion above is to reveal complexity surrounding the anatomy of values, and the importance of clarity regarding value hierarchy. Determining whether benefits of GOFR outweigh risks requires (1) distinguishing things that are intrinsically valuable from those that are merely instrumentally valuable and (then) (2) determining whether GOFR (or any particular case of GOFR) would lead to net benefit regarding the former kinds of goods in particular. RBA, however, will not settle questions about which goods pertaining to risks and benefits of GOFR are intrinsically valuable, because this is a matter of ethics rather than empirical science.",

First is the question of how potentially conflicting intrinsic goods should be weighed against one another-e.g., if GOFR would promote net gains in terms of some (e.g., aggregate well being) at net cost in terms of others (e.g., individual liberty in the way of freedom from significant risks in the absence of consent). Second is the question of the weight that should be given to benefits that may arise in the future-i.e., what, if anything, should the ''future discount rate'' be in the event that GOFR entails significant risks at present in order to achieve net benefits in the future (and/or for future generations) (Murray 1994) . Third, and especially important, is the question of risk aversion, risk appetite, and/or risk-taking strategy. It is common to place greater disvalue on losses than value on gains (e.g., in things like well being or money) of equal magnitude, and it is not obviously irrational to do so. Whether or not benefits of GOFR are thought to outweigh risks may thus (depending on RBA findings) partly depend on what is considered appropriate risk-taking strategy (e.g., to what extent, if any, should decision-making reflect risk aversion?). Different risk-taking strategies embodying different levels of risk aversion may yield different answers to questions about what should be done if RBA reveals that GOFR (or a certain case thereof) is reasonably likely to promote a significant amount of human well being (e.g., by facilitating disease control) but has a very small chance of leading to catastrophic consequences (e.g., in the event of laboratory accident or malevolent use of research findings).",

For many people, such a gamble would ultimately involve betting one's house, with a fairly high (i.e., 1 in 6) chance of losing it. This objection to the expected utility maximization approach to decision-making is that it might sometimes be rational/prudent to sacrifice expected utility in order to avoid options with especially costly possible outcomes. The underlying suggestion is that the expected utility maximization approach to decision-making is not sufficiently risk averse. The aim to avoid options with especially costly possible outcomes (even when the option in question maximizes expected utility) gives rise to doubt that GOFR should actually be pursued in the hypothetical example above-the idea being that it would be too risky to pursue a course of action that has a nontrivial possibility of killing 2,500,000,000 people even if expected utility would be maximized by such a course of action. 11 In any case, it would presumably be impractical to employ the expected utility maximization approach to decision-making in the context of GOFR policymaking-because such an approach requires (1) identification of all the possible outcomes of options, (2) estimation of the likelihood of such outcomes, and (3) estimation of the utility (or value) of each outcome. For reasons discussed above, this would be unrealistic in the case of GOFR (see also Douglas 2013; Resnik 2014) . It is impossible to predict, with any confidence, the likelihood of malevolent use (Posner 2004) , for example, and there are innumerable scenarios that could result from such use.",

It is commonly thought that such an approach, referred to as the maximin risk-taking strategy, would be especially appropriate in circumstances where the probability of outcomes that might arise from various options is unknown, but a risk-taking strategy like this could also be considered an alternative to the expected utility maximization approach to decision-making even in cases where the probabilities of option outcomes are estimable. In the latter kind of case, for example, the maximin strategy would call for a decision to refrain from GOFR in the hypothetical H5N1 example considered above, because the worst possible outcome of GOFR (2,500,000,000 lives lost) is worse than the worst possible outcome of refraining from GOFR (100,000,000 lives lost). The maximin strategy also captures the intuition that it would be irrational (for those who are not millionaires anyway) to take the high stakes die gamble. 11 This kind of objection to the expected utility maximization approach could arguably be addressed by accounting for risk-aversion-or the value of security-in the utility metric (i.e., rather than using number of lives lost or saved as a proxy for utility). Practical difficulties of the expected utility maximization approach (in the context of GOFR) discussed in what follows would nonetheless remain (and perhaps be exacerbated by more complicated utility metrics). Points (below) regarding the importance of democracy to value identification/weighting are likewise arguably applicable to expected utility maximization approaches employing more complicated utility metrics.

The strongest version of the precautionary principle would hold that we should not take actions that pose serious dangers (where likelihood of the dangers in question is uncertain). Cass Sunstein (2005) argues that such a strong version of the principle would be incoherent, because serious dangers will be possible outcomes of any course of action. In the context of the environment, it might be thought that this strongest version of the precautionary principle speaks against developing and/or releasing genetically modified organisms (GMOs), because their development/release might pose serious (though, admittedly, uncertain) dangers. Sunstein (2005) , however, has noted that the failure to develop and/or release GMOs might likewise pose serious (though, admittedly, uncertain) dangers, because it might turn out that GMOs enable avoidance of major famines that would otherwise occur. The strongest version of the precautionary principle would thus apparently (also) entail that we should not refrain from GMO development/release. In the context of GOFR one might argue that, according to the strongest version of the precautionary principle, we should not pursue GOFR because GOFR may lead to serious dangers involving laboratory accidents or malevolent use. By the same token, however, one might argue that we should pursue GOFR because GOFR might enable control of pandemics that would otherwise be disastrous. The strongest version of the precautionary principle thus appears to give conflicting advice regarding both GMOs and GOFR, and thus no guidance at all. Sunstein argues that people's appeal to the strongest version of the precautionary principle can be explained by the fact that they are more attuned to some kinds of dangers than others, due to cognitive bias. 13 More moderate versions of the precautionary principle hold that we should avoid actions (or courses of action) when the dangers they pose are not merely serious, but exceed severity thresholds. Sunstein (2005) , for example, appeals to an Anti-Catastrophe version of the precautionary principle according to which we should avoid courses of action that pose catastrophic dangers in particular. Because catastrophe might possibly result from any course of action he furthermore argues that the likelihood of catastrophe, though uncertain, would need to exceed a likelihood threshold-i.e., the catastrophic danger in question, though uncertain, would need to be sufficiently likely (as opposed to a theoretical or minutely remote possibility)-in order for the Anti-Catastrophe version of the principle to take effect. Though moderate versions of the precautionary principle like this might be more plausible than strong versions of the precautionary principle, questions remain regarding how likely a catastrophic risk would need to be in order for such a principle to take effect (i.e., where, exactly, should the likelihood threshold be set?). It also raises questions about the magnitude of harm that should divide catastrophic (or, in other moderate versions of the precautionary principle, sufficiently serious) dangers from others. Different risk-taking strategies, embodying different levels of risk aversion, will set such thresholds in different places.",

            "text": "Beyond utility risks and benefits, a crucial point of Sven Ove Hansson (2003) is that equity and rights are essential to risk-related decision-and policy-making. Just as it would (usually) be rights-violating and thus unethical for one person (or group) to harm another, it might at first glance be thought that it would be unethical for one person (or group) to impose risk of harm on others (in the absence of explicit consent). Because ordinary action-e.g., driving one's car down the street (without explicit consent of residents)-involves imposing risks on others, however, it cannot be the case that every instance of risk imposition on others (in the absence of explicit consent) constitutes unethical action (Hansson 2003) . We mutually benefit by allowing one another to impose (certain) risks on each other (in the absence of explicit consent); and if imposition of risks on others were ruled out, by ethics or policy, then human life would come to a standstill. This raises the question of what should be considered ethically acceptable risk imposition. Hansson argues that 14 Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) (presumably, for Clarke) involves a decision procedure along the lines of expected utility maximization. CBA often involves conception of utilities in monetary terms in particular (Sunstein 2005) , but it is not obvious that this is what Clarke has in mind. Clarke characterizes CBA as follows: ''CBA involves attempting to determine the probability of benefits occurring, and the probability of costs being incurred, as well as determining the relative sizes of the benefits and costs of a particular course of action and balancing these. This calculation is compared with the relative balance of costs and benefits for alternative courses of action from which the option with the best overall balance, adjusting for probability of these occurring, is selected'' (Clarke 2013, p. 224) . That Resnik's use of the precautionary principle involves conjunction with (rather than replacement of) cost-benefit thinking is revealed by his use of ''reasonable'' and his actual analysis. Resnik's idea obviously is not that we must do whatever it takes to avoid dangers posed by dual-use research at any cost; his analysis reflects the idea that costs and benefits of precautionary action need to be considered (and the idea that balance between costs and benefits determine what is ''reasonable''). Clarke might argue that Resnik's precautionary approach sounds like a re-description of cost-benefit thinking rather than a replacement thereof.",

Given global political economics, some might doubt that this is the case-because some people exposed to the risks involved benefit more from scientific and technological advance than others. If Hansson's principle is taken to be absolute, then risks associated with the scientific and technological enterprise would be considered unacceptable if such doubts about equity are justified. If a degree of inequity is inevitable (in light of global political economics) but the scientific and technological enterprise nonetheless perhaps enormously benefits the vast majority of (though not all) people exposed to the risks involved, then one might think that the risk imposition in question is actually justified. If Hansson's principle is absolute, then it would apparently always prioritize equity over utility, but it is plausible that small compromises regarding equity are at least sometimes outweighed by large utility gains (Selgelid 2009b) . A more moderate (and less binary) principle than that defended by Hansson (but which nonetheless remains sensitive to rights and distributive/egalitarian concerns) might run as follows: while everyone has a prima facie moral right not to be exposed to risk, over-riding of this right is ethically acceptable to the degree that risk-exposure is part of an equitable system for risktaking that works to the advantage of risk-exposed persons. Such a principle would be more tolerant of risks associated with the scientific and technological enterprise (and thus at least some cases of GOFR).",

Whether or not this is a fair criticism of expected utility maximization perhaps partly depends on how broadly ''utility'' is conceived-i.e., because disvalue of rights violations and/or inequality could arguably be factored into utility calculations in various ways. Hansson's criticism of expected utility maximization might be fair, however, if utility is more narrowly conceived in terms of well being (or, as in examples offered above, the number of lives saved or lost). decision making in ethically difficult cases where an action or course of action with an intended good effect can also produce a foreseen bad effect'' (Uniacke 2013, p. 153) . DDE holds that it may be morally permissible to pursue an action with a foreseen bad effect so long as the action in question is not itself morally problematic, the bad effect is not itself intended (it is merely foreseen), an intended good effect is directly produced by the action in question (and not directly produced by the bad effect), and this intended good effect outweighs the foreseen bad effect (the proportionality condition) (Uniacke 2013, p. 155) . Suzanne Uniacke illustrates the application of DDE to a case where a driver must swerve a car into the path of an innocent pedestrian in order to avoid crashing into a crowd. According to DDE, this might be ethically permissible because the killing of the pedestrian is merely foreseen rather than intended, the saving of the crowd is brought about by the swerving of the car (rather than being caused by the death of the pedestrian), and the many lives saved outweigh the one life lost.",

It thus highlights ethical desiderata that such judgments should be based upon, i.e., dimensions upon which policy makers (or decisions) could fare ethically better or worse. Because judgments will depend on numerous matters regarding which there is likely to be reasonable disagreement (i.e., matters that cannot be resolved by science and/or the discipline of ethics-e.g., questions about what is intrinsically valuable, the weightings that should be attributed to potentially conflicting values, appropriate levels of risk aversion, and/or appropriate risk-taking strategy), this framework suggests, among other things, that decision-and policymaking regarding the funding and conduct of GOFR should be as democratic as possible.

Reaching such a determination, however, need not imply judgment that such a study should not take place at all, because studies not funded by DHHS might be funded privately and/or funded by other US government agencies to be conducted in a classified manner. It should also be noted that the decision not to fund any given study (even, ironically, in cases where such a decision is largely or partly based on concerns about publication dangers) is arguably less weighty than the decision to censor a study would be. Censorship involves direct interference with the scientific enterprise, academic freedom, and/or freedom of speech. While this does not necessarily mean that censorship would always be wrong it does mean that the grounds for censorship would need to be stronger than grounds for refraining from funding (a case of) GOFR-because refraining from funding (a case of) GOFR would not involve direct governmental interference with the scientific enterprise, academic freedom, or freedom of speech. The decision not to fund (a case of) GOFR might sometimes reflect the conclusion that (in light of an all-things-considered assessment of benefits and risks involved) there might be better uses of taxpayers' money. Whether or not GOFR is involved, one should expect policy makers to consider possible risks/ harms as well as benefits when making decisions about what research to fund (World Health Organization 2010). These preliminary remarks are by no means intended to downplay the potential value/importance or fundability of GOFR in general. As with non-GOFR studies, some (proposed) GOFR studies may be more socially valuable, and thus more worthy of funding, than others.",

Manageability of GOFR risks, like other relevant features considered above, is a matter of degree rather than either-or. Other things being equal, the more manageable the risks of (any given case of) GOFR (which partly depends on the strength of the background web of prevention in place), the more ethically acceptable the (case of) GOFR would be. Conversely, the more important/beneficial (any given case of) GOFR is expected to be, the more we should be willing to accept potentially unmanageable risks. It is also worth noting that severity of potentially unmanageable risks is also ethically relevant-because some potentially unmanageable risks might be less severe than others (and some potentially unmanageable risks might not be very severe at all). 25 Here and in principles above (and below), a purpose of highlighting scalar dimensions of ethically relevant aspects of GOFR (i.e., highlighting that ethically relevant aspects of GOFR come in degrees rather than being either-or) is to reveal Footnote 23 continued equally (or more) beneficial than the GOFR under consideration. This point is implicitly addressed by the Research Imperative principle, because the importance of a research question is largely a function of the extent to which answering it is crucial to achievement of public health goals. 24 A similar point in the context of ''least restrictive alternative'' is made by Timothy Allen (unpublished). 25 Though arguably unmanageable, the weeds in my garden are tolerable. that: (1) appeal to either-or/binary criteria might not be sufficiently clear or action guiding (insistence that ''risks of GOFR must be manageable or reasonably manageable'', for example, is arguably prohibitively vague); and (2) strict insistence on certain criteria might rule out too much. With regard to (2) we might imagine cases of especially important/beneficial GOFR-i.e., addressing crucial (and potentially otherwise unmanageable) risks-that it might be appropriate to pursue even if the GOFR in question poses nontrivial risks of unmanageability with nontrivial severity (though less unmanageability and less severity than the risks that the GOFR aims to address). (Some might think this, for example, about the controversial ferret H5N1 influenza studies.) As noted above, the acceptability of unmanageability of (any given case of) GOFR depends on the costs (in terms of forgone benefits) of refraining from (the case of) GOFR (in question).",

Such a board should have microbiological, infectious disease, biosafety, and ethical expertise, which, combined with access to national security information, would allow better assessments of biosafety and biosecurity issues.'' For related proposals, see Selgelid (2007) and Miller and Selgelid (2008) . 28 At least in cases where the roles in question are not already part of NSABB's current mandate. 29 The need for additional biosafety research (and associated funding) in particular is also suggested by Evans and colleagues (2015) . I here additionally have in mind research that helps determine whether GOFR (as opposed to other kinds of less risky research) is needed to answer key scientific questions.",

Rather than drawing a sharp bright line between GOFR studies that are ethically acceptable and those that are ethically unacceptable, this framework is designed to indicate where any given study would fall on an ethical spectrum, where imaginable cases of GOFR might range from those that are most ethically acceptable (perhaps even ethically praiseworthy or ethically obligatory) (i.e., those that fare best with respect to all 8 dimensions), at one end of the spectrum, to those that are most ethically problematic or unacceptable (i.e., those that fare worst regarding all 8 dimensions, and thus clearly should not be funded/conducted), at the other.

In any given case of GOFR, our epistemic situation regarding achievement of any given desideratum will likewise be a matter of degree-i.e., there will be greater or lesser confidence regarding achievement level of each desideratum-and it is hard to imagine there being thresholds separating adequate from inadequate confidence. Another reason for resisting a framework based on necessary conditions is the intuition that compromised/suboptimal achievement of some desiderata might sometimes be compensated by high-level achievement of others.",

With regard to desirability, it is noteworthy that an algorithmic approach that merely aimed to separate ethically acceptable from ethically unacceptable cases of GOFR would fail to capture the degree to which any given study is acceptable or not. In cases of GOFR that fall at ends of the ethical spectrum, the framework suggested here (like an algorithmic approach) may give very clear guidance about what should be done. In cases of GOFR that fall in the middle/grey area, difficult judgments will need to be made, and, aside from the aim to achieve a democratic outcome (which should be an especially important desideratum), there might not always be clear right answers regarding whether a given case of GOFR should proceed (or be funded).
