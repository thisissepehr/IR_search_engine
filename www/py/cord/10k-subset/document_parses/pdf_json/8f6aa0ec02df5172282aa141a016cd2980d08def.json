Southern blot analyses confirmed the presence of the p24 coding sequence within the genome of transgenic lines. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from transgenic plants identified plant-expressed p24 protein that cross-reacted with a p24-specific monoclonal antibody, thus confirming the maintenance of antigenicity. Quantification of the p24 protein using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) estimated yields of approx 3.5 mg per g of soluble leaf protein. Similar accumulation levels of p24 were also detected in T1 plants, confirming that the p24 gene is transmitted stably. Our results indicate that plant-based transgenic expression represents a viable means of producing p24 for the development of HIV vaccine and for use in HIV diagnostic procedures.",

Plant-based production systems have the potential to be safe and cost-effective alternatives to the traditional production systems (4). Following the pioneering work on the expression of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen in tobacco plants (5), transgenic approaches have been used to successfully produce several different protein antigens in plants including Norwalk virus capsid protein, heat-labile enterotoxin B, cholera B subunit oligomers, and gastroenteritis coronavirus glycoproteins (3). When the purified proteins or crude leaf extracts were introduced into animals, they were able to elicit immunological responses (6,7), thus supporting the use of plant-based antigens for the development of vaccines. More interestingly, recent studies have shown that antigens produced in plants are able to induce immune responses in animals that are directly fed antigen-containing plant tissues, thereby supporting the feasibility of edible vaccine production (8-10). In addition to stable expression in transgenic plants, several RNA plant viruses have been used successfully to transiently express vaccine antigens in plants (3,11-13).",

However, in this system the inserted p24 open reading frame (ORF) was not stably maintained in the viral vector. Toward the development of a stable plant-based production scheme for p24 protein, we have introduced a p24 gene cassette into the genome of tobacco plants using Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer.

To determine whether p24 protein accumulated in the transgenic plants, total soluble protein was extracted from the leaves of lines 14 and 15, representing lines with high and low copies of p24 transgene. Western blot analysis revealed a protein that cross-reacted with a p24-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3) . Compared to the standard HIV p24 protein from virus-like particles (VLP) of mammalian origin, which is free of glyco residues, the plant-derived product displayed a lower migration rate, which corresponded to approx 32 kDa. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of p24 protein using a glycosylation-site-predicting program (29) showed that the 49th amino acid serine and the 124th amino acid threonine of p24 are potential sites for O-glycosylation. Therefore, the reduced migration observed may have resulted from the presence of glyco-residues.

The Tn5 neomycin phosphotransferase gene (KanR) driven by the pTiT37 nopaline synthase promotor (P NOS ) provides a marker for selecting stable transformants. The origin of replication (Ori) from pBR322 and the cos site from \u03bb were also included in the T-DNA region and are flanked by the right (BR) and left (BL) border. The 4 kb segment flanking by EcoRI sites was subsequently used to identify the presence of p24 in transgenic tobacco lines.",
