Research in word processing has used acronyms as a tool to answer fundamental questions such as the nature of the word superiority effect (WSE) or which is the best way to account for word-reading processes. In this study, acronym naming was assessed by looking at the influence that a number of variables known to affect mainstream word processing has had in acronym naming. The nature of the effect of these factors on acronym naming was examined using a multilevel regression analysis. First, 146 acronyms were described in terms of their age of acquisition, bigram and trigram frequencies, imageability, number of orthographic neighbors, frequency, orthographic and phonological length, print-to-pronunciation patterns, and voicing characteristics. Naming times were influenced by lexical and sublexical factors, indicating that acronym naming is a complex process affected by more variables than those previously considered.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acronyms represent a significant and idiosyncratic part of our everyday vocabulary. The demands of a highly technical society have dramatically increased the proportion of acronyms encountered in everyday language. Acronyms are nowadays regularly found in scientific and nonscientific journals (e.g., DNA, EEG, CD-ROM, DVD, radar, sonar, VAT, CPI, OXO, NATO, NHS, etc.) and are actively used in text messages and e-mail communications (e.g., lol, MYOB, BW, etc.). The practice of abbreviating complex words is not new (e.g., INRI is an acronym that dates back to Roman times); however, their use has been relatively sparse until the second world war, when the formation of new acronyms escalated, since they were a convenient way of accelerating and encrypting communication. As an indication of the breathtaking expansion of acronyms in the language, the first edition (1960) of the Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary (AIAD) comprised 12,000 headwords, while the 16th edition (1992) included more than 520,000 headwords. The AIAD dictionary has been recognized as one of the most important books of reference by the American Library Association (1985) , and its 43rd edition has just been made available to the public in June 2010. Strictly speaking, the term acronym refers to pronounceable abbreviations formed with the initial letters of a compound term, while initialism is the name for the same type of abbreviations that are \"unpronounceable.\" Despite this original distinction, the label initialism is rarely used, while acronym has extended its meaning to pronounceable and unpronounceable abbreviations. It is in this extended sense that the term acronym is going to be used here.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 348, "end": 369, "text": "OXO, NATO, NHS, etc.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1168, "text": "(1985)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A distinctive characteristic of acronyms is that their configuration does not obey orthographic and/or phonological rules. They are often formed by a sequence of illegal letter strings that can become highly familiar to the language user (e.g., ABC, BBC, CNN, FBI, fm, HIV, KFC, pm, TV, USB, etc.) . Due to this peculiar illegality, acronyms have recently been used in the study of two influential models of reading aloud: the triangle model and the dual-route cascade model (Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007b) . An important discrepancy between these two models lies in the relative relevance given to the frequency of the word in contrast to its regularity when it is read aloud. One of the models under investigation in Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b) was the connectionist triangle model (Harm & Seidenberg, 2004; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989) . The model proposes a single processing system for reading all known words, irrespective of their frequency and regularity, and all unknown/ novel words. This is achieved by means of a learning mechanism that extracts the statistically more reliable (frequent) spelling-sound relationships in English. Importantly, orthographic and/or phonological rules are redundant in the model, and therefore, they have not been specifically implemented. The other model investigated is the nonconnectionist dual-route cascade model (Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, & Haller, 1993; Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001) . It proposes two reading routes or procedures: a lexical route and a nonlexical route. The lexical route entails direct connections between the mental representations of the written form of the word and the spoken form of the word and, also, detoured connections between written and spoken word forms with their corresponding conceptual representations in the semantic system. The nonlexical route converts letters into sounds applying the orthographic and phonologic rules of the language. The latter route is indispensable for reading novel words and nonwords, since no mental representation for them has been formed. Nonlexical processing will also give the correct pronunciation of regular words, although this is not the only reading pathway available to them. Correct reading of irregular words, however, needs to be accomplished via the lexical route, since these words do not stick to the pronunciation rules of the language. Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b) tested these models by looking at the differential N400 repetition effect found for words (hat) and pseudowords (e.g., dawk) but not for orthographically illegal nonwords (mdtp). They argued that according to the dual-route model, the sensitivity of the N400 component to the repetition of legal letter strings, for both words and pseudowords (Deacon, Dynowska, Ritter, & Grose-Fifer, 2004; Rugg, 1990) , could only reflect the performance of the nonlexical pathway, since this is the only route available for reading novel items such as the pseudowords. In consequence, no repetition effects in the N400 should be observed when acronyms are read, since their irregularity precludes the use of the nonlexical route. It is important to note that it is not clear how the predicted and reported absence of repetition effects for illegal letter strings fits into the argument, since illegal letter strings also make use of the nonlexical pathway. Connectionist models, alternatively, would predict repetition effects in the N400 for words, pseudowords, and acronyms, since the same process underpins the recognition of any type of letter string. Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b) found N400 repetition effects for words, pseudowords, and acronyms, but not for illegal nonwords. They concluded that this outcome could be accommodated only by the connectionist account for oral reading. However, Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b) failed to notice that pseudowords-in particular, pseudohomophones and those pseudowords extracted from high-frequency words-can generate activation in the lexical pathway (Coltheart, 2007) . The lexical route will not produce the correct reading of pseudowords but can be, nevertheless, stimulated. Taking this into account, their results can be perfectly explained by the dual-route model through the activation of the lexical route by words, acronyms, and pseudowords. This explanation also reconciles better with the lexico-semantic processing found to be associated with the N400 component (Sheehan, Namy, & Mills, 2007; van Elk, van Schie, & Bekkering, 2010) . Equivalent N400 amplitudes were found for words and acronyms in a subsequent study (Laszlo & Federmeier, 2008) in which the N400 sentence anomaly paradigm was used. The authors concluded that this pattern of results is not reconcilable with the dual-route model.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 297, "text": "CNN, FBI, fm, HIV, KFC, pm, TV, USB, etc.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 475, "end": 503, "text": "(Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 716, "end": 745, "text": "Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 783, "end": 808, "text": "(Harm & Seidenberg, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 809, "end": 839, "text": "Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1404, "text": "(Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, & Haller, 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1456, "text": "Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2421, "text": "Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 2765, "end": 2812, "text": "(Deacon, Dynowska, Ritter, & Grose-Fifer, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2824, "text": "Rugg, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 3564, "end": 3593, "text": "Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 3808, "end": 3837, "text": "Laszlo and Federmeier (2007b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 4009, "end": 4026, "text": "(Coltheart, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4432, "end": 4462, "text": "(Sheehan, Namy, & Mills, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 4463, "end": 4501, "text": "van Elk, van Schie, & Bekkering, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 4587, "end": 4614, "text": "(Laszlo & Federmeier, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Acronyms have also played an important part in the investigation of the word superiority effect (WSE). Gibson, Bishop, Schiff, and Smith (1964) , for example, investigated the relative contribution that meaningfulness and pronounceability had in the WSE. They devised two experimental conditions: one formed by meaningful but unpronounceable trigrams (these were all acronyms), and the other by meaningless but pronounceable trigrams (these were all pseudowords). They showed an advantage for acronyms in word recognition memory and recall, suggesting that meaning, rather than pronounceability, had a more powerful influence in these processes. Similar results were reported by Henderson (1974) , who also manipulated meaning and pronounceability using acronyms and pseudowords. He found that participants were faster at judging pairs of items as being the same (e.g., FBI-FBI; BLI-BLI) or different (e.g., FBI-IMB; BLI-LSF) if a meaningful item or acronym was in the pair. A number of later studies have replicated the influence of meaning in the WSE, using acronyms in their experimental sets (Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007a; Noice & Hock, 1987; Staller & Lappin, 1981) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 143, "text": "Gibson, Bishop, Schiff, and Smith (1964)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 679, "end": 695, "text": "Henderson (1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1124, "text": "(Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1144, "text": "Noice & Hock, 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1168, "text": "Staller & Lappin, 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In sum, acronyms have been an integral part of experimental manipulations in a number of studies of word recognition and reading (Gibson et al., 1964; Henderson, 1974) . The main reason for the use of acronyms has been their unusual combination of meaning and pronunciation, especially because the latter does not obey the standard spelling-to-sound correspondences of the language in use. The orthographic irregularity of acronyms, thus, has been paired with that of illegal letter strings, while their meaning and familiarity have been considered as equivalent to that of other words in the language. Although their meaning and peculiar pronounceability are indeed acronym characteristics, these might have been overemphasized to the detriment of other factors also known to be relevant in oral reading and word recognition processes. First, for example, not all acronyms comprise only consonants or all vowels, and those that do can be read by the application of a particular rule (i.e., letter naming). This rule might make acronyms somehow \"regular\" and different from other illegal letter strings. Second, acronyms tend to be items that are acquired during adulthood, and there is abundant evidence showing that late learned words are processed slower than early acquired words (for reviews, see Juhasz, 2005) . Third, acronyms are related to a more restricted number of familiar meanings than are conventional words, and words with few meanings tend to be processed more slowly than words with many meanings (Azuma & Van Orden, 1997; Ferraro & Hansen, 2002; Hino & Lupker, 1996; Klepousniotou & Baum, 2007) . Another important difference is that orthographic and phonological length is often uncorrelated in acronyms. In contrast to conventional words, an acronym can often be orthographically short but phonologically long (e.g., HIV has only three letters but five sounds, ai-ch-eye-vee). Finally, the number of orthographic neighbors associated to acronyms is generally much lower than those found in standard words. Orthographic neighborhood refers to all the words that can be formed by changing one letter from a target word while keeping constant the rest. Evidence shows that words with few orthographic neighbors take longer to be recognized (Alameda & Cuetos, 2000; Andrews, 1992; Perea, Acha, & Fraga, 2008; Whitney & Lavidor, 2005) . All these properties (e.g., a late age of acquisition, short letter length, low number of meanings, etc.) make acronyms a very idiosyncratic material, possibly more than ever thought. More important, sets of acronyms and familiar words merely matched in letter length might not be easily comparable, and results from previous studies (Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007a , 2007b could have been confounded with a number of uncontrolled variables.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 150, "text": "(Gibson et al., 1964;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 151, "end": 167, "text": "Henderson, 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1315, "text": "Juhasz, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1540, "text": "(Azuma & Van Orden, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1564, "text": "Ferraro & Hansen, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1585, "text": "Hino & Lupker, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1613, "text": "Klepousniotou & Baum, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2258, "end": 2282, "text": "(Alameda & Cuetos, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2283, "end": 2297, "text": "Andrews, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2298, "end": 2325, "text": "Perea, Acha, & Fraga, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 2326, "end": 2350, "text": "Whitney & Lavidor, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 2687, "end": 2714, "text": "(Laszlo & Federmeier, 2007a", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 2715, "end": 2722, "text": ", 2007b", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Here, the authors present an investigation of 146 acronyms in relation to their orthographic illegality, peculiar pronunciation and six other lexico-semantic characteristics. Acronyms have generally been viewed as some kind of irregular word or even as a sort of \"nonword with meaning.\" However, the question of whether acronyms are processed as irregular words has never been tested. In order to address this question, the authors contrasted acronym-naming times against a number of lexical and semantic factors known to be relevant when mainstream words are read and manifestly overlooked in previous studies involving acronyms. The study is important since acronyms appear to be an effective material in the investigation of word recognition and reading aloud. Interestingly, in most word recognition and naming studies in which no acronyms but conventional words are used, a careful selection of the material is carried out to ensure that only the factor under investigation varies, while intercorrelated variables are controlled for. Normative data have proven useful in these studies of word recognition and production, yet there is a complete absence of norms for acronyms. This is in spite of the fact that acronyms are not only useful material to facilitate the experimental manipulations in word-processing research, but also a topic of scientific inquiry. Thus, a number of studies (Besner, Davelaar, Alcott, & Parry, 1984; Coltheart, 1978) have been concerned with the lexicality of acronyms, and attempts have been made to clarify whether acronyms enjoy the cognitive status of a word or a nonword. In the latest of these studies, Brysbaert, Speybroeck, and Vanderelst (2009) found that acronyms produced an associative priming effect equivalent to that generated by conventional words, and importantly, this effect was independent of case presentation. concluded that acronyms are lexicalized items integrated in our mental lexicon.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1393, "end": 1434, "text": "(Besner, Davelaar, Alcott, & Parry, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1451, "text": "Coltheart, 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1688, "text": "Brysbaert, Speybroeck, and Vanderelst (2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In recognition of the growing interest of acronyms in psycholinguistic research and the imperative need of normative data for this type of stimuli, the authors present here an investigation of the lexico-semantic properties of 146 acronyms and their relationship with acronym-naming speed.

One way in which the lexical similarity of a word has been operationalized is counting the number of words formed by changing one letter from the given word while keeping constant the position and identity of the rest of the letters (Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, & Besner, 1977) . For example, the word peace produces four neighbors: peach, pence, pease, and place. It is often referred to as N, and it is the more commonly used measure in studies of lexical similarity.

This relationship between N, orthography, and phonology introduces the possibility that N-effects might be the consequence of phonological, rather than orthographic, computation. Adelman and Brown (2007) tested this hypothesis by analyzing the results from four existing megastudies of word recognition in English (Balota et al., 2000; Balota & Spieler, 1998; Spieler & Balota, 1997; Seidenberg & Waters, 1989) .

Monaghan & Ellis, 2010; Strain, Patterson, & Seidenberg, 2002; Zorzi, Houghton, & Butterworth, 1998) . The difficulty of this enterprise is reflected in the fact that establishing the best classification method still is a bone of contention. Venezky (1970) was one of the first to study the letter-tosound patterns in English. He grouped the written representation of sounds into graphemes (letter or combination of letters equivalent to one sound) and established two types of grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences: major for those occurring with higher frequency and minor for those occurring with lower frequency. As an illustrative example of Venezky's taxonomy, the pronunciation of ea as in seal was described as a major correspondence, while the pronunciations for ea in steak or bread were minor correspondences. Adhering to Venezky's classification, Coltheart (1978) proposed a ruled-based mechanism for coding phonological information, known as the grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences (GPC) system. The application of the rules governing major correspondences, or the GPC system, allows the correct pronunciation of all the English regular words. However, a different but parallel lexical mechanism is required to allow for correct pronunciation of irregular words (those whose graphemes are converted to phonemic correspondences not embedded in the GPC system). The lexical and sublexical GPC mechanisms (also referred as routes) will produce the correct pronunciation for all regular words and nonwords. However, these two routes generate conflicting pronunciations for irregular words. The resolution of the conflict takes time, and this slows down responses. A common finding supporting the existence of these two routes for reading is that regular words are processed faster and more accurately than irregular words (Baron & Strawson, 1976; Gough & Cosky, 1977; Parkin, 1982; Stanovich & Bauer, 1978; Waters & Seidenberg, 1985) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 334, "end": 359, "text": "Rastle & Coltheart, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 360, "end": 386, "text": "P.

In order to obtain frequency ratings, participants are asked to estimate how many times they encounter and/or use a particular word. This measure of frequency is normally considered to be subjective and is often used interchangeably with the concept of word familiarity. In this study, a rated estimation of the subjective frequency/familiarity of a list of acronyms is presented along with a printed frequency measure for each acronym. Frequency corpuses tend to underrate the frequency of acronyms because they either avoid the inclusion of abbreviations (Zeno, Ivens, Millard, & Duvvuri, 1995) or are based on language samples where acronyms are scarcely represented (e.g. from subtitles SUBTLEX us ). For this reason, acronyms' printed frequency was calculated using three Internet search engines (www.altavista.com; www.google.co.uk; www.bing.com), as suggested by Blair, Urland, and Ma's (2002) method. That is, each acronym was entered into the search function, and the number of hits returned was recorded as the measure of the acronym frequency. The validity of this method was provided by Blair et al. They compared frequency estimations based on two commonly used corpuses (i.e., the Ku\u010dera & Francis [1967] corpus and the Celex database [Baayen, Piepenbrock, & Gulikers, 1995] ) with frequency calculations based on the number of hits returned by four Internet search engines (i.e., Alta Vista, Northern Light, Excite, and Yahoo). Frequencies from the search engines were collected at two points in time, with an interval of 6 months between them. Results showed high correlations between the frequency values provided by corpuses of written text and those generated by the search engines (e.g., Alta Vista frequencies correlated .81 with Ku\u010dera and Francis and .76 with Celex [Baayen et al., 1995] ) and high test-retest reliabilities (r 0 .92).

However, they do not show the same pattern of correlations with the number of syllables, the number of orthographic neighbors, and imageability.

The recent introduction of some of these acronyms means that they are learned late in life, despite their high frequency of appearance in print. AoA ratings showed significant and negative correlations with imageability and rated frequency, meaning that the later acquired the acronym, the lower its imageability and perceived frequency.

Studies of standard word naming have struggled to find bigram frequency effects once other variables such as N, onsets, and rimes are taken into account (Andrews, 1992; Bowey, 1990; Strain & Herdman, 1999) . The fact that a particular variable does not show an effect on a particular behavior (e.g., reaction time or accuracy) does not mean that the processes associated to that behavior are free from its influence.

The regression lines plotted in Fig. 3 showed that highfrequency unambiguous acronyms and high-frequency ambiguous typical acronyms were named faster than their low-frequency counterparts. However, high-frequency ambiguous and atypical acronyms were named slower than low-frequency ambiguous and atypical acronyms. This reversed frequency effect is interpreted as a result of the reading context. In the context of naming acronyms (pronouncing most of them by naming each letter aloud), reading aloud acronyms following grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences is slowed down because this pronunciation mechanism conflicts with a letter-by-letter naming mechanism more frequently used in this particular task context. The higher the frequency of the acronym pronounced following graphemeto-phoneme correspondences, the greater the conflict and the time needed to resolve it. The same kind of argument can be applied to the significant interaction found between AoA and ambiguous typical acronyms. Figure 2 shows the usual difference between naming early and late acquired typical acronyms, with faster naming for early learned acronyms than for later learned acronyms. However, early learned ambiguous atypical acronyms are named much slower than late acquired ambiguous atypical acronyms. As with printed frequency, the \"reversed\" AoA effect might be due to a conflict between pronunciation mechanisms. This conflict is not normally encountered, since naming acronyms is infrequent in comparison with naming mainstream words. 4 The arbitrary mapping hypothesis (Ellis & Lambon Ralph, 2000) argues that AoA effects emerge only when the knowledge of the material learned first cannot be applied to material learned some time later. Word reading is a good example of this differential effect. AoA effects are particularly large when participants read aloud irregular words, but tiny or no effects have been reported when regular words are named. The difference here is that while the pronunciation of late acquired regular words (e.g., groin) can be inferred from the pronunciation of other early acquired words (e.g., coin). The pronunciation of irregular late acquired words (e.g., suave) cannot be derived from the pronunciation of any other word learned earlier (regular or irregular).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1805, "end": 1806, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1868, "text": "(Ellis & Lambon Ralph, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 315, "end": 321, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1283, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "General discussion"}, {"text": "Most acronyms adhere to typical acronym-naming rules (letter naming).

There is a precedent for this claim in the literature concerning letter-byletter dyslexics. As Howard (1991) noted, patients with acquired dyslexia will often name each letter of a written word in turn before producing a whole-word pronunciation. It has been argued that this strategy is used because there is an obstacle to processing the letters of a word in parallel. In cases where letter naming is preserved while whole-word recognition is impaired, it is possible to argue that there are disparate routes for the two processes. It could be that rather than this capability developing to overcome a specific deficit, the mechanism is available to all readers. In normal readers, the letter-naming rule system is applied only when it is necessary or efficient to do so, such as in acronym reading. Letter-by-letter readers may be forced to rely on this system in all instances.
