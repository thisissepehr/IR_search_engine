            "text": "Mechanisms of VZV pathogenesis and the host response to VZV infection in the lungs is poorly understood because of limited access to human lung biopsies during acute infection and the strict host species specificity of VZV. Simian Varicella Virus (SVV) shares 70-75% DNA homology with VZV 5 and intra-bronchial infection of rhesus macaques (RM) recapitulates the clinical features of primary VZV 6 . Recent studies from our group have reported the presence of a vigorous anti-SVV response characterized by effector memory CD8 T cell infiltration, a robust CD4 T cell response, and production of antiviral cytokines/chemokines and growth factors in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 7 . However, we still do not have a clear understanding of the host response to varicella virus within the lung tissue. Here, we leveraged this animal model to characterize SVV-induced immune response as well as changes in lung histopathology and gene expression during primary varicella infection. Our results show that SVV infection results in lung injury as evidenced by focal hemorrhaging collapse of airways, and reduced expression of genes with a role in lung development and/or function. SVV infection also induces a robust immune response as evidenced by immune cell infiltration, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and increased expression of genes involved in host defense. The development of this immune response correlates with decreased SVV viral loads. Moreover, as viral loads decrease, a shift towards increased expression of genes with a role in tissue regeneration and increased levels of growth factors is observed. Collectively, these data increase our understanding of mechanisms of host defense and the development of respiratory complications during VZV infection.",

After SVV infection, the frequency of CD8 T cells in the BAL increased 10 and 14 DPI (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, frequencies of both B and T cells were low in na\u00efve lungs, but increased as early as 3 DPI, with CD8 T cells showing the largest increase 10 and 14 DPI (Fig. 3b) . T cell activation was indicated by the increased prevalence of the highly differentiated CD8 EM T cells and CD4 CM T cells 7 to 14 DPI and CD4 EM 7-10 DPI (Fig. 3c,d) . We also observed an increased frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), and macrophages (MACs) 3-7 DPI in both BAL and lung (Fig. 3e,f) . To further characterize the immune infiltrates, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine changes in distribution and frequency of CD3, CD20, CD68, Ki67 and granzyme B (GRZMB) positive cells (Fig. 4) . As detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 3) , intensity of CD3, CD20 and CD68 staining increased 3 DPI and peaked 7 DPI (Fig. 4b) . Peak staining of GRZMB and Ki67 was also observed at 7 DPI and correlated with increased frequency of memory T cells detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 4b) .

The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) correlated tightly with viral loads, with the highest number of DEGs detected 7 DPI (Fig. 5a and Supplemental Datasets S1-4). Changes in gene expression were validated for a subset of genes using qRT-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). The 54 DEGs that were differentially expressed 3, 7 and 10 DPI (Fig. 5b) segregated into 3 clusters. Cluster 1 contained 30 DEGs whose expression gradually increased until it peaked 10 DPI (Fig. 5c) . Several of these genes are involved in cell cycle such as cyclin kinase subunit 2 (CKS2), Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2 (RRM2), and topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A). Cluster 2 contained 7 DEGs whose expression was substantially increased as early as 3 DPI and remained high until 10 DPI before decreasing back to DEGs 3DPI play a role in innate immunity and lung development. Most of the 106 DEGs that were up-regulated 3 DPI mapped to Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with antiviral immunity (Fig. 6a) . Several genes that enriched to the GO process \"immune system process\" are part of a network regulated by Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 1 (STAT1; FC 4) (Fig. 6b) . Most of these DEGs have antiviral function such as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) ISG15 (FC 8), MXA (FC 7), and GBP1 (FC 7) as well as dsRNA sensors DDX60 (FC 5) and RIG-I (FC 4) 9 (Fig. 6b) (a) Bar graph shows the number of genes mapping to each of the 10 most statistically significant GO terms to which the 106 upregulated genes enriched.

This analysis showed that a group of genes that play a role in the cell cycle progression (e.g. Top2a, BUB1, CEP55, SPC25 and CENPF) were highly expressed by B cells, dendritic cells and T cells (Supplemental Fig. S2 , cluster 1). We also identified 2 additional clusters of genes that were mainly expressed by MACs (e.g. ADAMDEC1, IgJ, SIGLEC1, CXCL9 and CXCL10) (Supplemental Fig. S2 , cluster 2a,b). Two small clusters are expressed by NK cells (e.g. GZMB, GZMA and SAMD3) (Supplemental Fig. S2 cluster 3a,b) , and an additional cluster of antiviral genes was seen in the neutrophils (e.g. DDX60, OAS2, and RASD2) (Supplemental Fig. S2, cluster 4) .

In this study, we leveraged a robust model of VZV infection wherein rhesus macaques are intrabronchially infected with the homologue SVV to carry out the first in depth analysis of the host-pathogen interactions during acute varicella infection in the lungs using a combination of immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, multiplex ELISA, and RNA sequencing. Our analyses show for the first time that SVV spreads rapidly through the lungs replicating both within the lung parenchyma as well as BAL immune cells. We also report the down-regulation of genes important for lung function, indicative of lung injury during the acute phase of infection. Immune responses and changes in gene expression tightly correlate with viral loads with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ISGs, chemokines and granzyme genes at peak viral loads. In contrast, genes associated with cell cycle and lung repair were up-regulated after cessation of viral replication. Immunohistochemistry staining and flow cytometry show that SVV infection results in significant infiltration of lymphocytes and MACs in the lungs as early as 3 DPI and before the appearance of varicella rash, typically detected 10-14 DPI. This is in agreement with previous reports of patients who developed varicella pneumonia before the development of the vesicular rash 3, 4 . As previously reported for BAL 7 , we saw a higher accumulation of highly differentiated CD8 T cells compared to CD4 T and CD20 B cells within lung biopsies. CD8 T cells were also the most abundant lymphocyte subset in the lungs of mice intra-nasally infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 43 and rhesus macaques infected with H1N1 influenza 44 . Furthermore, CD8 T cells were shown to be essential for recovery in mice infected with Vaccinia virus 45 . In addition to lymphocytes, frequency of MACs within the lung biopsy also increased 3 and 7 DPI, returning to pre-infection levels 10 DPI. Bioinformatic analysis of DEGs detected 3-10 DPI using ImmGen also indicate that transcriptional changes are mediated by T cells, B cells, DCs, MACs, neutrophils and NK cells 3 and 7 DPI, with a bigger contribution of DCs, MACs, and neutrophils 7 DPI. In contrast, gene expression changes 10 DPI seem to be primarily originating from lymphocytes.",

Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18, IL-1\u03b2 , IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 also significantly increased in the BAL. These factors have been reported during other lung infections suggesting a common defense response to respiratory pathogens. For instance, IL-18 has been shown to activate NK cells and stimulate IFN\u03b3 production during influenza infection in the lungs 46 . Increases in IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 have also been observed in nasopharyngeal lavage samples taken from influenza patients, BAL samples taken from flu infected rhesus macaques, and BAL samples from rhesus macaques infected with pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria [47] [48] [49] . The sources of these factors could be alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells as previously reported during influenza infection and lung injury 50, 51 . Indeed, ImmGen analysis also shows IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 to be highly expressed by MACs. Interestingly, no chemokines or cytokines were increased in the lung homogenate, suggesting that immune mediators are quickly secreted into the alveolar space and do not remain within the lung parenchyma. In support of this hypothesis, mRNA transcripts of CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10, CXCL11 (ITAC), IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 within lung homogenates were significantly increased. Protein levels of all these chemokines were increased in the BAL at the same time point.",

Another source of IFN\u03b1 could be epithelial cells, which, like pDCs, express the double stranded DNA sensor TLR9 52 , and could secrete type 1 interferons in a RIG-I dependent manner as described for RSV infection 53 . Alternatively, IFN\u03b1 could also be secreted by alveolar macrophages, which were the primary producers of IFN\u03b1 in mice infected with Newcastle disease virus 54 . Concomitant with the increased IFN\u03b1 levels in the BAL, we detected a significant up-regulation of the transcription factor STAT1, induced by type 1 and 2 interferons 3 DPI 11 . STAT-1 in turn regulates the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which play a critical role in inhibiting viral replication. Indeed, ISGs were among the most highly up-regulated genes in our data set (average FC = 18). The increased expression of ISGs persists until 10 DPI and correlates with decreased viral loads 10 and 14 DPI. Our observations are similar to those described for influenza and RSV where increased expression of ISG15, RIGI, IRF1, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFIT1 and STAT1 have been shown to play a role in disease resolution [55] [56] [57] . Similarly, reduced ISG expression has been associated with severe cases of H5N1 infection in cynomologous macaques 58 .",

Significant increase in expression of cell cycle genes was also observed in mice recovering from MRSA-induced pneumonia 68 . The up-regulated cell cycle genes could also indicate the beginning of the repair process in the lungs since young immune competent rhesus macaques resolve primary varicella infection without complication. In line with that hypothesis, we detected an increase in growth factors VEGF and PDGF-BB, and angiogenic factor VEGF-A 10 and 14 DPI, which have been shown to play a critical role in alveolarization in the lungs and repairing damaged alveolar walls 69, 70 .

A robust immune response led by interferon-stimulated genes, granzymes, cytokines and chemokines is critical for the resolution of infection. These data also show that although SVV infection in young macaques is self-limiting, significant lung injury occurs during the acute phase as a result of the immune response and viral replication, a phenomenon that has not previously been described. Our results provide potential insights to both what happens in a self -resolving infection, and by extension, what may be happening when infection results in severe complications. Specifically, our RNA sequencing data show reduced expression of genes important for lung function during peak viral replication. In immune deficient individuals who lack the vigorous immune response, uncontrolled viral replication could lead to sustained reduction in the expression of these critical genes, which in turn results in severe lung damage and viral pneumonia. Furthermore, immune genes that are significantly up-regulated likely play a critical role in resolving infection; therefore, lack of increased expression of these genes may explain why the immunocompromised develop severe disease. On the other hand, adults may generate too vigorous of an immune response that results in severe inflammation and viral pneumonia. These data help design interventions to mitigate complications associated with VZV pneumonia and other infectious respiratory diseases.",
