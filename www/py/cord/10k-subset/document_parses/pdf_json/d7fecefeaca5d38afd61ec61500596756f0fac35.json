For its development in RBCs, nutrients not only from the RBC cytosol but also from the extracellular milieu must be acquired. Although the utilization of host nutrients by P. falciparum has been extensively analysed, only a few studies have reported its utilization of host serum proteins. Hence, the aim of the current study was to comprehensively identify host serum proteins taken up by P. falciparum parasites and to elucidate their role in pathogenesis.",

            "text": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a protozoan that reproduces in red blood cells (RBCs) and requires various host factors for its development and survival. For instance, protozoan parasites, including Plasmodium spp., rely on salvaging purines from the host as they are unable to synthesize purine rings de novo [1] . Furthermore, the parasites acquire amino acids as well as iron ions from the haemoglobin of their host cells. Interestingly, haemoglobin does not contain isoleucine and is low in several amino acids, such as methionine, causing these amino acids to be imported from the extracellular milieu [2] . Although the uptake mechanism of nutrients from the extracellular milieu has been intensively analysed [3] , few studies have reported the uptake of host serum proteins. For example, ovalbumin, P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2, human serum albumin (HSA), \u03b2-galactosidase, \u03b2-amylase, and horseradish peroxidase Tougan et al. Malar J (2020) 19:155 (HRP) are taken up and digested by the parasite after addition to the parasite culture medium [4, 5] . Kininogen is also taken up and modified to form bradykinin as well as other kinins, via intracellular proteolysis, which then elicits a calcium response in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro [6] . Plasminogen is taken up and hydrolysed, facilitating the production of active angiostatin-like fragments that function to modulate host physiology during infection [7] . Furthermore, Tougan et al. [8] demonstrated that vitronectin is taken up by parasiteinfected RBCs (iRBCs) where it binds directly to the P47 domain of serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5), thereby camouflaging the parasite and enabling its evasion of the host immune system. Ca 2+ is essential for parasite development during the erythrocytic stage [9] . Plasma Ca 2+ , specifically, contributes to merozoite invasion of RBCs, as well as parasite development in RBCs [10] [11] [12] . Cytoplasmic Ca 2+ concentration has been shown to slowly increase during parasite development, activating both host and parasite proteases during the schizont stage, and inducing merozoite egress from iRBCs [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, plasma Ca 2+ is required for host blood coagulation [16] . Activation of blood coagulation is frequently observed in patients with malaria, which subsequently induces inflammation and severe malaria-associated symptoms. In fact, the degree of coagulation activation is proportional to the severity of disease-related symptoms such as fever and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [17, 18] . Clinically apparent DIC is associated with severe outcomes and high mortality rates. During severely complicated malarial infection, the intrinsic coagulation pathway is activated by thrombin generation, which is pivotal for activation of the coagulation cascade [19] . Activated thrombin cleaves the major parasite adhesive protein on the surface of iRBCs. Consequently, iRBC adhesion dramatically decreases, and adherent iRBCs detach [20] .",

Comparative analysis revealed that vitamin K-dependent protein S (protein S) and prothrombin were taken up by intact parasites in a highly selective manner (Table 1 ; uptake ratio: protein S, 26.10; prothrombin, 10.36). The results of western blotting analysis were similar to those of the shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1a) . Although the uptake ratio of vitronectin was relatively low (3.99; Table 1 ) it was internalized in a strongly selective manner (Fig. 1a) , as previously reported [8] . These findings suggest that serum proteins were selectively taken up, rather than simply diffusing into iRBCs. Further, confocal microscopy showed that prothrombin was localized in iRBCs, most notably within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs), during the trophozoite stage (Fig. 1b) . Specifically, prothrombin was detected in iRBCs during development (Figs. 1c and 2b, PDS panels) . Uptake of protein S, prothrombin, and vitronectin was also observed in the blood samples prepared from mice infected with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii (Additional file 1: Fig. S2 ), suggesting that similar uptake mechanisms are present among Plasmodium spp.",

The Ca 2+ concentration in PDS was approximately eightfold higher than that in NCS, whereas that in NCS was within the normal range (Fig. 3a) . This finding indicated that the Ca 2+ concentration in the PDS-containing culture medium was similar to that in normal serum since the culture medium contained 10% human serum (see parasite culture in \"Methods\"). The importance of the Ca 2+ concentration of the culture medium for protein uptake was confirmed by the following strategies: (1) addition of Ca 2+ to NCS; and (2) removal of Ca 2+ from PDS. The addition of CaCl 2 to the NCS-containing culture medium was expected to slightly improve parasite growth (Fig. 3b) ; however, the SERA5 expression levels were similar in the media with and without CaCl 2 (see SERA5 in Fig. 3c) .

Further, the uptake of serum proteins into the PV was slightly reduced by CytD and MycB treatment, suggesting that uptake occurs without the assembly/disassembly of actin filaments (Fig. 4c, d, CytD and MycB). Additionally, following Jas treatment serum proteins were detected at low levels in PV lysates (Fig. 4c , d, Jas) even though Jas arrested parasite development at the early stage ( Fig. 4a , b, Jas and c, SERA5), suggesting that uptake is induced before DNA replication, as also shown in Fig. 1c .",

The isolated parasite lysate prepared from iRBCs cultured in NCS-containing medium was added to plasma. (i) The absence of fibrinogen indicated coagulation, save for in the isolated parasite lysate (lanes 3 and 4). (ii) Visual confirmation of coagulation. Tubes, shown in lanes 3, 4, 5, and 6 in (i), containing 100 \u00b5L of the reaction mixture were rotated at a 90\u00b0 angle onto their sides after completion of the coagulation reaction. All experiments were performed in triplicate and representative data are shown ( Fig. 4a, b , Jas and c, SERA5). Hence, although the current study did not sufficiently demonstrate a relationship between the uptake mechanism and endocytosis, the study performed by Smythe et al. [5] reported that the uptake of preloaded recombinant HRP is inhibited by Jas, and not by CytD, suggesting that Jas does in fact inhibit endocytosis in the parasites. Further studies are required to more clearly elucidate the role of endocytosis in the protein uptake mechanism. A comparison of the primary structures of these three internalized proteins revealed that both protein S and prothrombin have a \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) domain that is responsible for high-affinity binding to Ca 2+ [38, 39] . This domain anchors proteins to cell membranes that expose phosphatidylserine (PS) in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner [40] . In eryptosis, a type of programmed cell death for RBCs, Ca 2+ influx into iRBCs exposes PS residues on the outer membrane leaflet [41] . It is speculated that the serum proteins that bind to PS on the outer membrane leaflet of RBCs pass through the membrane via unknown mechanisms. Vitronectin does not contain this domain, but rather forms a complex with thrombin in serum [42] and may be taken up as the complex. Other Gla domain-containing proteins, such as Factor VII, IX, X, XIV, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2 had considerably lower uptake ratios (Table 1 ). These findings imply that the Gla domain and other factors determine uptake ability.",

Although serum albumin is necessary for parasite growth [43, 44] , the uptake of prothrombin is not essential in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3) . Considering that the parasite-dependent activation of coagulation causes severe malarial complications [18] , our findings provide further insights into the role of thrombin in eliciting symptoms during parasitic infection. In particular, the direct activation of prothrombin in isolated parasite lysate (Fig. 5c) implies that DIC was mediated in response to this reaction. In addition, it is also possible that activated thrombin detaches iRBCs from the cell surface. Activated thrombin cleaves the major parasite adhesive protein P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) on the surface of iRBCs, dramatically reducing the adhesion of iRBCs and detaching iRBCs [20] . Hence, parasites may promote their cytoadherence by selectively taking up serum thrombin that cleaves PfEMP1, or by eliminating host factors that could limit cytoadherence.",
