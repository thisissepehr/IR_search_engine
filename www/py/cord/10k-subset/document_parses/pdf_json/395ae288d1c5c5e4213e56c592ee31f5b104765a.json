Between May 2009 and May 2010, all allo-HSCTs who presented with respiratory symptoms were screened for the presence of the H1N1 virus. Oseltamivir resistance was assessed and chart reviews were performed for all cases. In all, 51 of 248 (20%) allo-HSCT recipients followed at our outpatient clinic were screened. We identified 10 patients with H1N1 infection. Close contact with children was the most commonly suspected mode of transmission. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were present in eight and five patients, respectively. Lymphopenia (o1 G/L) was the most frequent biological abnormality. High immunosuppression was responsible for severe infection requiring mechanical ventilation associated with prolonged viral shedding in three patients who had significant comorbidities and GvHD. Two of them developed an oseltamivirresistant strain and both patients died subsequently despite intensive therapy, resulting in a case fatality rate of 20%. In conclusion, although most allo-HSCTs had mild symptoms from H1N1 infection, severe immunosuppression and emergence of oseltamivir resistance were likely responsible for a substantial morbidity, further supporting the need for vaccination and monitoring of close contacts, especially children.",

To better define H1N1 infection in this highly immunocompromised patient population, we reviewed our recent experience at the Geneva University Hospital.

A total of 46 had an active GvHD (acute grade X2 or chronic extensive). According to predefined institutional guidelines, all allo-HSCT recipients who presented with respiratory symptoms (such as sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion or dyspnea) with or without fever were investigated for the presence of H1N1 and other community-acquired respiratory viruses (such as adenovirus, metapneumovirus, seasonal influenza A and B, parainfluenza, picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus). All specimens for microbiological confirmation were taken from combined nasopharyngeal and throat swabs at the time of initial screening. In addition, bronchoalveolar lavages were performed in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Serial specimens were collected at the discretion of the treating physician. All patients gave their informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.",

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was defined as hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates or new abnormal chest auscultation findings, together with identification of the H1N1 virus in bronchoalveolar lavage or upper respiratory secretions. Hospital-acquired infection was defined as symptom onset 47 days after admission. The immunodeficiency status was graded as published elsewhere, 4 either as severe (SID) or MID (moderate).

Notably in this study, 31% of patients had ill household contacts. 26 Taken together, these observations should alert physicians involved in the care of HSCT patients about the high risk of viral transmission through close contact with children, underlining the importance of education and vaccination of patients and their family households.

Interestingly, LRTI, prolonged viral shedding, hospitalization, longer antiviral treatment, ventilator requirement and H1N1 resistance were documented only in SID patients. Lymphopenia, which has been previously reported as a risk factor for LRTI, both for community-acquired RVI [1] [2] [3] [4] 33 and for H1N1 influenza 9,14-18,26 was observed in six patients at the time of diagnosis. Chronic GvHD and its corollary of long-term immunosuppression has also been associated with the risk of developing RVI and LRTI. 1 Recently, Taplitz et al. 18 showed that the use of 420 mg of prednisone equivalent daily was significantly associated with the development of LRTI and with 30-day mortality. In our study, 11% (5/46) of patients with active GvHD contracted an H1N1 infection as compared with 2.5% (5/202) of patients without GvHD (Po0.03). Furthermore, 5 of 33 (15%) patients within the first year post transplant had an H1N1 infection, whereas only 5 of 215 (2.3%) patients after the first year were infected (Po0.005). Taken together, these observations suggest that highly immunocompromised allo-HSCT recipients are at risk for severe complications from influenza and deserve close monitoring.",

Therefore, influenza vaccination of family members and close contacts, especially children, is strongly recommended to limit the risk of influenza exposure in HSCT recipients. Additional strategies such as post-exposure oseltamivir prophylaxis for high-risk patients may be warranted. 19, 26, 38 Our study has several limitations. The number of H1N1confirmed cases was low, making the reliable estimation of clinical outcomes, such as mechanical ventilation or mortality rates, difficult. Furthermore, only a limited number of allo-HSCT recipients within 6 months post transplant (19 patients) were included, precluding us to precisely analyze the impact of H1N1 infection in the early post-transplant period.",

Complications included higher rates of LRTI, prolonged viral shedding and respiratory failure. Our study strongly supports the need for vaccination and monitoring of family households, especially children. 39 ",
