Design and setting: Observational study in a tertiary referral center, Intensive Care Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects and methods: Seventeen adult patients with ARDS were treated with venovenous or venoarterial ECMO after failure of conventional therapy. The Murray score of pulmonary injury averaged 3.5 (3.0\u00b14.0) and the mean PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio was 46 (31\u00b165). A standard ECMO circuit with nonheparinized surfaces was used. The patients were minimally sedated and received pressure-supported ventilation. High inspiratory pressures were avoided and arterial saturation as low as 70 % was accepted on venovenous bypass. Results: In one patient a stable bypass could not be established.",

The cause of death in the three nonsurvivors was intracranial complications leading to total cerebral infarction. Conclusion: A high survival rate can be obtained in adult patients with severe ARDS using ECMO and pressure-supported ventilation with minimal sedation. Surgical complications are amenable to surgical treatment during ECMO. Bleeding problems can generally be controlled but require immediate and aggressive approach. It is difficult or impossible to decide when a lung disease is irreversible, and prolonged ECMO treatment may be successful even in the absence of any detectable lung function. and a high concentration of inspired oxygen may be mandatory but is harmful to the lungs and may cause further damage [3, 4, 5, 6].",

In venoarterial (V-A) ECMO blood was drained from the right atrium via a cannula in the right internal jugular vein and returned to the right common carotid artery, which was ligated cranial to the cannula. In venovenous (V-V) ECMO blood was normally drained from the right atrium and returned to one femoral or external iliac vein, although the opposite direction was used on a few occasions. Normally V-V ECMO was preferred, but if the patient was hemodynamically unstable or was to be transported on bypass, V-A ECMO was used [15] . The blood was pumped with a St\u00f6ckert roller pump through two membrane oxygenators (3.5 or 4.5 m 2 ) and heat exchangers (Avecor) in parallel. Nonheparinized polyvinylchloride tubing was used except for the raceway, where Supertygon was used. The standard ECMO cart was equipped with a battery backup, thus being mobile and useful for transports within the hospital. At the beginning of the series and in all cases of V-A bypass the cannulation was performed as an open surgical cut-down procedure. The last patients in the series on V-V bypass were cannulated using a percutaneous or a semipercutaneous technique. Bypass was maintained at a rate necessary to provide adequate gas exchange or at a rate equal to the maximal venous return.",

FIO 2 0.4, peak inspiratory pressure 25, positive end-expiratory pressure 5\u00b110, rate 10; Siemens 300). ET tubes were avoided in order to decrease the need of sedation. Patients, who were not tracheotomized, received a tracheostoma within a few days on ECMO to facilitate airway management. Initially during the ECMO run when gas exchange over the lungs was minimal, arterial saturations as low as 70 % had to be accepted when the patient was on V-V bypass. Patients on V-V bypass were weaned to a flow rate of approx. 1 l/min, after which the sweep gas was decreased and turned off several hours before decannulation. Patients on V-A bypass were weaned to a flow rate of about 0.5 l/ min and kept on this low flow for several hours before decannulation. Decannulation was performed with the patients only slightly sedated and under local anesthesia, when the patient had been cannulated by an open surgical procedure. Cannulas inserted percutaneously or semipercutaneously were simply withdrawn without anesthesia and with a gentle pressure applied afterwards. No bridges were used in the circuit. Anticoagulant therapy was kept between 180 and 200 s by a continuous heparin infusion. Apart from standard blood chemistry, coagulation parameters (PK, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, d-dimers, antithrombin III, fibrin monomers) were analyzed daily. When there were signs of consumption coagulopathy, intravascular coagulation or fibrinolysis the circuit was changed.",

As a result of this support the lungs can be ventilated at lower inspiratory pressures and with a lower fraction of oxygen and thus further iatrogenic trauma is avoided. Treatment of the primary disease and method of patient care such as mode of ventilation on ECMO may differ between centers and may to some extent explain differences in the results. Furthermore, the extracorporeal life support can be performed in various ways, which also may explain discrepancies in results. Gattinoni et al. [30] focused principally upon CO 2 removal and an almost apnoeic oxygenation, which was also the case in the study by Morris et al. [8] . After initiation of ECMO, however, there is often an increased opacification of the lungs [25] and decreased compliance, resulting in less oxygenation and a demand for higher inspiratory pressures, which again may become harmful to the lungs. With a higher extracorporeal flow the extracorporeal support may also contribute substantially to the oxygenation of the patient. V-A bypass may provide a nearly total extracorporeal gas exchange if the flow is high enough. With V-V bypass a nearly total oxygenation can also be obtained if the cannulas are positioned so that the recirculation is min-1634 imized, and if a slightly lower arterial saturation is accepted than normally.",

Peak inspiratory pressures never exceeded 25 cmH 2 O during ECMO compared to mean value of 43 cmH 2 O before ECMO (Table 1) . Initially on V-V bypass, when the lungs were unable to contribute to any substantial gas exchange, low arterial saturation values were accepted instead. Great care was taken to sedate the patients minimally and maintain CO 2 values at levels so that patients triggered in pressure-supported ventilation [26] . Although not experimentally confirmed, we have gained the impression that pressure-supported spontaneous breaths are superior to intermittent mandatory positive pressure ventilation. This is based mainly on clinical observations when patients on ECMO are subjected to various surgical procedures and require deep anesthesia including muscle relaxation. As soon as spontaneous breaths ceased, gas exchange over the lungs deteriorates, and the patient requires higher extracorporeal flow. When on spontaneous pressure-supported ventilation, the flows can again be decreased.",

At autopsy massive thrombotic masses were seen in the right atrium and emboli in the pulmonary artery. Although the cannulation may have contributed to pulmonary embolization, the thrombotic masses in the right atrium could hardly be compatible with life for an extended period, an opinion supported by the fact that the circulation was unstable prior to cannulation. The other three patients who succumbed had intracranial complications incompatible with life. They never regained consciousness during ECMO despite withdrawal of sedatives. Computed tomography was therefore performed, and this showed the intracranial complication. Theoretically, cerebral infarction is the only complication that cannot be treated while on ECMO, and a total cerebral infarction is an obvious indication for withdrawal of extracorporeal therapy. Irreversible lung dis-ease has been considered an indication for withdrawal of extracorporeal support [9, 24] . For the same reason, a pre-ECMO ventilatory treatment exceeding 7\u00b110 days is considered a contraindication for ECMO in several centers as the ventilator injury may have caused irreversible lung damage. Seven of the 17 patients in the present series had been ventilated at least 7 days before initiation of ECMO. Two of them subsequently died for the reasons given above. To date, however, we know of no method to determine when the disease is irreversible. Lung biopsy shows only the condition of the tissue being examined, and a diagnosis of irreversibility based on this specimen presupposes that the disease is uniform in all parts of both lungs [29] . The present findings also illustrate that total lack of pulmonary function and pulmonary hypertension does not indicate irreversibility. In 4 of the 17 patients reported the ECMO run time was or exceeded 3 weeks. In all of these patients practically no pulmonary function was demonstrable during the first 2 weeks. In the patient with the longest extracorporeal life support (no. 12), the first signs of any significant gas exchange over the lungs were seen after 46 days on bypass.",

In another study using nonheparinized equipment the daily need of transfusions averaged 4.6 U red blood cells and 0.5 U fresh frozen plasma (median 3.2 and 0.3, respectively) [31] .

In the present study the mean daily need for blood products (red blood cells, plasma, and platelets) was only 796 ml.

Furthermore, V-A bypass involves ligation of the right common carotid artery in order to infuse to oxygenated blood in the aortic root. Before ligation we normally clamp the artery and measure the pressure above the clamp to ensure an adequate collateral circulation, either through the circle of Willis or via the right external carotid artery. In the present series V-A ECMO was used only in cases of hemodynamic instability or transportation on bypass. In none of the nine patients on V-A bypass were there any neurological complications which could be attributed to the carotid ligation or arterial embolism. The four nonsurvivors in the overall series were all initially on V-V bypass (one was eventually converted to V-A). Bleeding complications are among the most common complications in ECMO [36] but can generally be managed as outlined above. An immediate and aggressive approach is mandatory even if it involves a major surgical procedure. Extracranial bleeding should not be regarded as an indication for withdrawal of ECMO.",

Surgical complications are amenable for surgical treatment during ECMO, and bleeding problems can generally be controlled. It is difficult or impossible to decide when a lung disease is irreversible, and prolonged ECMO treatment may be successful even in the absence of any detectable lung function.",
