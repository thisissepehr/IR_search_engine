The impact of polymicrobial ICUAP is not extensively known. We therefore investigated the characteristics and outcomes of polymicrobial aetiology of ICUAP. Method: Patients with ICUAP confirmed microbiologically were prospectively compared according to identification of 1 (monomicrobial) or more (polymicrobial) potentially-pathogenic microorganisms. Microbes usually considered as non-pathogenic were not considered for the etiologic diagnosis. We assessed clinical characteristics, microbiology, inflammatory biomarkers and outcome variables. Results: Among 441 consecutive patients with ICUAP, 256 (58 %) had microbiologic confirmation, and 41 (16 %) of them polymicrobial pneumonia. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and several Enterobacteriaceae were more frequent in polymicrobial pneumonia. Multi-drug and extensive-drug resistance was similarly frequent in both groups. Compared with monomicrobial, patients with polymicrobial pneumonia had less frequently chronic heart disease (6, 15 % vs. 71, 33 %, p = 0.019), and more frequently pleural effusion (18, 50 %, vs. 54, 25 %, p = 0.008), without any other significant difference. Appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment was similarly frequent in the monomicrobial (185, 86 %) and the polymicrobial group (39, 95 %), as were the initial response to the empiric treatment, length of stay and mortality. Systemic inflammatory response was similar comparing monomicrobial with polymicrobial ICUAP. Conclusion: The aetiology of ICUAP confirmed microbiologically was polymicrobial in 16 % cases. Pleural effusion and absence of chronic heart disease are associated with polymicrobial pneumonia.

The use of inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy is a major determinant of mortality in patients with ICUAP [5] , emphasizing the importance of a timely and accurate therapy for this infection [6] . For this reason, it is often necessary to use a combination of broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, particularly in patients who are at risk for difficult-to-treat bacteria [7, 8] . Recent investigations have shown that multi-drug-resistant (MDR) or high-risk pathogens have been isolated in around half of patients with an episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ICUAP confirmed microbiologically [9, 10] . ICUAP, and particularly VAP, can be caused by more than one microbial pathogen. Multiple etiologic pathogens are potentially an additional challenge for achieving appropriate antimicrobial treatment in these patients. A previous study reported a 48 % rate of polymicrobial etiology in episodes of VAP with microbiologic confirmation [11] . These authors concluded that the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with monomicrobial and polymicrobial VAP did not differ significantly. However, in this study, a substantial proportion of episodes classified as polymicrobial VAP had positive isolation of bacteria usually considered as non-pathogenic microorganisms.
