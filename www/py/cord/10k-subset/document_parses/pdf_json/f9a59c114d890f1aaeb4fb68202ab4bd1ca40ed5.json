Cytokines are used in medicine for the treatment of cancer, immune disorders, viral infections, and other socially significant diseases, but the extent of their use is limited by the high production cost of the active agent. The development of this area of pharmacology is associated with the success of genetic engineering, which allows the production of significant amounts of protein by transgenic organisms. The review discusses the latest advances in the production of various cytokines with the use of genetically modified plants.",

The main stages of DNA modification in living organisms are the search for and decoding of regulatory regions of the genome (promoters, terminators) and sites encoding the amino acid sequences of the proteins; their excision and fusion in the required combinations; and introduction into the cell genome. Biotechnological methods make it possible to overcome species barriers and perform recombination outside the organism with high accuracy. In the simplest case, genetic modification leads to the appearance of foreign proteins in the cell or changes in the synthesis level of one of the cell proteins.",

Such produced and purified recombinant proteins can be used for functional analysis and structural and biophysical studies, as well as in pharmacology. For example, mammalian insulin was synthesized in Escherichia coli in 1977 [1] . After 5 years, the use of this hormone, which is produced by bacteria, was approved by FDA (US Food and Drug Administration), giving rise to the use of recombinant proteins in the medicine. Expression systems based on bacterial, insect, and mammalian cell cultures [2, 3] , yeast [4] , and plants [5] are currently used for commercial protein synthesis. Such areas as the produc-tion of the heterologous protein in the milk of transgenic animals [6] and the cell-free protein synthesis system are also being developed [7] .",

Although the genetic code is universal, different organisms have dissimilar mechanisms of RNA processing and post-translational processing of the protein. Thus, prokaryotic cell splicing of eukaryotic genes (intron excision) does not occur, which requires a further modification of the heterologous gene prior to transformation. Differences in such processes as the folding of the recombinant protein, its glycosylation, phosphorylation, and the formation of disulfide bonds may decrease its biological activity until a complete loss of function or cause an allergic reaction as the result of its therapeutic use. Foreign proteins can be toxic to the producer [8, 9] . It is generally accepted that a closer congeniality of the producer and donor provides the best results. Thus, expression systems in mammalian cells are the most successful for the production of proteins for medical purposes. However, they are not suitable for the production of proteins with high signaling activity, in particular, hormones, and lose out to alternative systems in terms of production costs and biosafety. A universal system of gene synthesis of proteins does not currently exist, and it is often impossible to predict which of the existing systems will be better for the industrial production of one or another protein [2, 9] .",

Among the currently available transgenic organisms, plants are of the utmost economic importance due to the possibility of their large-scale agricultural use. Molecular breeding is an area of biotechnology that solves the classic problems of agriculture by traditional genetic modification of plant varieties for their adaptation to intensive farming methods. The genetic transformation of plants was developed in the 1980s [10] . To date, transgenic plants resistant to herbicides, pests, and pathogens, as well as plants with balanced, modified compositions of amino acids, fatty acids, and secondary metabolites, have been produced and implemented. These advances allow us to improve agricultural productivity and maintain global food production constantly to meet the requirements of the growing world population [11] [12] [13] . Intensive research in this area has led to the introduction of simple and well-characterized methods of plant transformation that have served as the basis for the use of plants as producers of pharmaceutical proteins. Human growth hormone [14] and IgG1 (6D4) antibody fragment [15] were produced from transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and sunflower plants (Helianthus annuus L.) shortly after the technology of plant transformation appeared. In 1997, the recombinant avidin, which is suitable for commercial use, was isolated from transgenic maize (Zea mays L.), confirming the possibility of producing recombinant proteins on a large scale [16] . Since then, numerous antibodies, vaccines, cytokines, and other proteins were produced by plant expression systems with the use of both mature plants and cell cultures [13, 17] .",

First, they provide high infection security from plants to humans, since they are free of pathogens and animal viruses and can be grown without the use of materials of animal origin. For biomass growth they require only light, water, carbon dioxide, and minerals, which simplifies and reduces the cost of the production. In comparison with microorganisms, glycosylation systems and other post-translational modifications of proteins in plants and mammals are close [8, 18, 19] , which makes it possible to obtain complex glycoproteins with preservation of their biological activity and stability [20, 21] . For plants, there are by now a variety of relatively simple and well-established transformation techniques. The heterologous gene can be integrated into the nuclear or chloroplast genome or into a vector for a temporary (transient) expression. Transgenic plants can be cultivated both in vitro in cell suspension culture or in a callus tissue and in vivo in the whole organism; agricultural cultivation technology makes it possible to achieve a minimal price per biomass unit among transgenic expression systems [22] .",

This facilitates the collection of raw material. The addition of the signal of subcellular localization in the vacuole or apoplast to the target protein enables long-term storage and transport of the product without conservation or freezing. Finally, for some proteins used for medical purposes that have an effect when administered orally, there is the possibility of avoiding procedures of isolation, purification, and injection through the use of plants as edible immunomodulators and vaccines. This eliminates the most complex and expensive production steps, which require skilled personnel. These actions can dramatically reduce the cost of the accumulated recombinant protein in plants and simplify their use [17, 22, 23] . Most current transgenic plant-based production systems were created from a soil bacterium, the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and related bacteria with natural transformation mechanisms. The Ti-plasmid of A. tumefaciens carries a set of genes responsible for the transport of a fragment of the same plasmid into a plant cell and its integration into the genome. A DNA fragment of Ti-plasmid inserted into the nuclear genome of the host cell was designated as T-DNA. Any genetic construct can be inserted into in the T-DNA and transferred into the plant genome by molecular biology techniques [24] . The method of A. tumefaciens use (Agrobacterium-mediated transformation) is convenient and simple; it has a high probability and accuracy of the integration of the heterologous gene and the ability to work with fairly long (up to 150 kb) DNA fragments. This method is used for the transformation of both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants with certain limitations, and it is the de facto standard method in the production of transgenic plants [22, 25, 26] .",

The absence of plastid genome inheritance from pollen eliminates the threat of uncontrolled spread of the transgene during plant cultivation in the field. One promoter may control the synthesis of several proteins due to operon organization of the genetic material of the chloroplast [13] . The synthesis of heterologous proteins in plastids may decrease their toxic effect on the plant cell. However, a disadvantage of this expression system is that it is impossible to control the direction of recombinant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, and therefore a conduction of series of posttranslational modifications occurs [22] .

Thus, the agroinfiltration method includes treating leaf tissue of tobacco with an Agrobacterium suspension in the presence of a factor that damages cell membranes, such as pressure or vacuum, which leads to a massive infection of cells, the appearance of multiple T-DNA copies in cells, and the production of a large amount of recombinant protein in a short time [31] . The delivery method of the genetic construct by modified plant viruses, the propagation of which gives rise to multiple copies of the heterologous gene and intensive production of protein, is also common [32] . There is also a hybrid technology in which the viral vector is deprived of the proteins responsible for penetration through the cell membrane and is introduced into plant cells as part of the T-DNA of A. tumefaciens, thus increasing the yield of the target protein [33] . Transient expression vectors are not inherited during the sexual reproduction of plants, eliminating the threat of uncontrolled spread of the transgene. Transient expression allows plant growth under controlled conditions. Among its disadvantages are the limited amounts of recombinant protein resulting from a single act of transformation and the need for constant production of the vector system in large quantities. Transient expression does not require the regeneration of a whole plant, and it can be used to produce recombinant proteins within a few days. This system may be used to quickly target the production of therapeutic proteins, especially vaccines, in a limited time [34, 35] .",

The high growth rate of the cell culture and the lack of necessity for full regeneration of plants provide a sufficient amount of recombinant protein in a short time. In the suspension culture conditions, cells with thin cell walls are able to secrete the recombinant protein in an environment that facilitates its isolation and purification.

They may affect the whole body after penetration into the blood stream (endocrine), nearby cells, for example, at the site of inflammation (paracrine), and the cells synthesizing this cytokine (autocrine). Some researchers separate cytokines into a new separate regulation system existing along with the nervous and endocrine systems for the maintenance of homeostasis [42] .

Cytokine classification may be done based on both biochemical and physiological properties, based on the types of receptor binding cytokines [39, 42, 44] . At the moment the most common classification takes into account all of these parameters. It should be noted that, due to the variety of cytokines and their long study, some molecules were independently characterized by different groups of researchers, for example, interleukins 19, 20, and 24 represent the same compound. Many established names also belong to the early period of cytokine research, when the scale of this group of proteins was not known. The term \"interleukins\" was originally used to designate those cytokines for which leukocytes were the main target cells. The vast majority of them are produced by T-helper cells. Lymphokines are cytokines synthesized by lymphocytes; monokines are synthesized exclusively by monocytes. Interferons are cytokines involved in antiviral response. Colony-stimulating factors support the growth of cells of different pathways of hematopoiesis. Chemokines mediate chemoattraction (chemotaxis) between cells. Tumor necrosis factors induce cell apoptosis, etc.",

The Epo gene is expressed at minimal levels in other organs and tissues (brain, placenta, spleen, and lungs).

One of the most interesting approaches to increase the yield of protein includes the introduction of mineral salts or bovine serum albumin into the nutrient medium, which stabilized the secreted cytokine [60] . A significant (up to fourfold) increase in the yield was also achieved by adding a gelatin to the medium (up to 5% by weight). However, in cultures older than 4 days, the gelatin inhibited cell growth, probably by activating proteolytic enzymes [61] . In the rice suspension culture cells, the yield of the desired protein was 129 mg/L of the culture due to the use of amylase promoter Ramy3D in the absence of sugar, which is necessary for promoter activity [62] . The system was subsequently optimized by the following three approaches: (I) amylase gene silencing (amylase is the dominant protein in rice cells); (II) rice cysteine protease gene silencing; and (III) co-expression of the cytokine with protease inhibitor [64] . Each of these strategies increased the yield of recombinant GM-CSF by at least two times. Mouse GM-CSF (mGM-CSF) was successfully obtained in rice suspension culture cells with a yield of 24.6 mg/L medium [65] . The same glycoprotein was expressed in tobacco leaves with a yield of 19 \u03bcg/g fresh leaves [66] . The biological activity of recombinant human and mouse GM-CSF obtained in rice suspension cell culture was confirmed with GM-CSFdependent TF1 cells and mouse NFS-60 myeloid leukemia cells, respectively, [21, 65] . Full-grown plants were used for the production of GM-CSF. The maximum yield of recombinant protein reached approximately 0.02% [67] in the leaves of transgenic sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and approximately 0.22% of the total soluble protein in tobacco leaves [66] . In the seeds of transgenic plants, recombinant GM-CSF was up to 1.3% of the total protein in rice [68] , and up to 0.03% of the total soluble protein in tobacco [69] . The highest amount of protein (up to 2%) was synthesized by using the potato virus X (PVX) with a modified protein of the envelope as the vector [70] . The protein was also synthesized in such expression systems as rice and tobacco seeds with the rice glutelin GT1 and GT3 promoters. In most cases, the biological activity of recombinant GM-CSF was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by experiments with mice [71] and hamsters [72] .",

            "text": "IL-2 plays the role of a growth factor for all subpopulations of T-lymphocytes and also activated B-lymphocytes, thus being an important stimulator of specific immune response, and it also has antitumor activity. IL-4 affects primarily B-lymphocytes and inhibits the synthesis of some proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, TNF, IL-1 and IL-6). IL-2 has strong adjuvant properties, e.g., the ability to enhance the effect of vaccination when administered simultaneously with the antigen [73] . The first report on the biosynthesis of recombinant IL-2 and IL-4 in tobacco cell suspension culture was published in 1998 [74] . Tobacco cells were transformed with a construct carrying the hIL-2 sequence of cDNA and synthesized up to 0.38 mg human IL-2/g callus tissue or 0.08 \u03bcg/mL of the liquid cell culture. It was assumed that the presence of a signal peptide in the N-terminal region would provide an extracellular localization of recombinant proteins. However, the effectiveness of the secretion was insignificant, and the majority of the produced cytokines remained in the cells. Only proteins isolated from cells had the ability to maintain in vitro proliferation of IL-2-dependent murine cell line CTLL-2. In the study [75] , the expression of hIL-2 in potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers was performed under the control of tissue-specific promoter. The activity of the recombinant protein was 115U/g of plant tissue. In a later study [76] , different lines of transgenic tobacco plants synthesizing both individual mature IL-2, and IL-2 in combination with two different protease inhibitors were produced. The recombinant protein contained six histidine residues (Tag) at the N-terminal region, and it was ligated to the C-terminal localization signal in the endoplasmic reticulum. The yield of protein was 1.8-9.5 \u03bcg IL-2/g fresh leaf and 0.4-3.5 \u03bcg IL-2, which is crosslinked to protease inhibitor/g fresh leaf. Both IL-2 forms synthesized in CTLL-2 cell culture had biological activity, the expression of which was not impaired by the presence of Tag, c-Myc, or proteinase inhibitors to the molecule. Recombinant IL-2, which is crosslinked to Tag or c-Myc and bears a localization signal to the endoplasmic reticulum or the chloroplast, was synthesized in tobacco plants [77] . The protein yield was not measured, but the purified IL-2 exhibited activity on CD4 + T-cells from mouse spleen.",

Recombinant IFN of bacterial origin are usually used for the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma, myeloid leukemia, and hepatitis A and C. [95, 96] . IFN-\u03b3 belongs to class II interferons and is responsible for the regulation of antiviral and antitumor immune response [42] . IFN is often expressed in plant-based systems. The first reports on the production of human interferon were in the early 90s. [97] . Human IFN was expressed in transplastomic tobacco plants, which determined a significant level of its synthesis (20% of the total soluble protein) [98] . Not only human interferons but bovine [99] , hen [100] , and salmon interferons [101] were successfully obtained in plant-based production systems. IFN-\u03b3 was synthesized in rice suspension cell culture with the use of the constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter, an inducible rice promoter \u03b1Amy3/Ramy3D. The signal peptide of the alphaamylase was used to ensure the secretion of the recombinant IFN-\u03b3 in culture medium in both cases. The recombinant protein had biological activity on an A549 human cell line infected with dengue virus (DENV). The highest yield of the desired product under the control of the ubiquitin promoter was 12 ng/mL of culture medium (699.79 ng/g fresh cells) and 17.4 ng/mL (131.6 ng/g fresh weight of cells) of \u03b1Amy3 / Ramy3D promoter [102] . Transgenic constructs for the coexpression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and IFN-\u03b3 in plants for the production of an \"edible vaccine\" were obtained [103] .",

The choice of promoter is an important step in the production of transgenic systems for recombinant protein synthesis. The most commonly constitutive promoters are used: 35S promoter derived from cauliflower mosaic virus and the ubiquitin promoter isolated from maize. The main advantage of constitutive promoters is the constant gene expression in all parts of the plant. However, constitutive promoters have a low expression level and often undergo silencing as a result of methylation during transgenic plant growth [107] . Methods based on the use of inducible promoters are activated only under special conditions, and tissue-specific promoters working in certain plant organs became more widely used with the development of biotechnology. The silencing phenomenon was not detected when inducible promoters were used. At the present time, there is no complete description of these promotors, which limits their use. The identified plant inducible promoters depend on steroids (estradiol) [108] and ethanol [109] . \u03b1Amy3/RAmy3D promoter, which is activated in the absence of sugar, and the promoter of the gene of the small heat shock protein 18.2 (sHSP18.2) are used in suspension cell cultures [62, 110, 111] .",

For example, after the optimization of transgene codons, an efficient accumulation of IGF-1 in transgenic tobacco chloroplasts was achieved. The native gene IGF (IGF-n), which contains 41% AT pairs, and the synthetic IGF-s gene, which has the optimal content of AT pairs for chloroplast (60%), were cloned into a vector with psbA promoter (promoter of the gene encoding a subunit of the reaction center of photosystem II), 5'-UTR (increases the translation efficiency during illumination), and 3'-UTR (increases the stability of the transcript). The accumulation of IGF-n product in the transgenic plants was 9.5% of soluble protein, and the accumulation of IGF-s product reached 11.3%.

An initial failure in the production of functionally active heterologous proteins in transgenic plants, in particular erythropoietin [57] , confirmed the assumption that the difference in the composition of the glycosidic groups of native mammalian glycoproteins and proteins expressed in plants determine the stability of the recombinant product and its biological function [115] . Attachment of the carbohydrates to the polypeptide chain occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Although many steps of protein N-glycosylation are common to all eukaryotes, the composition of complex N-glycans in plants and mammals may be different [116] . Thus, the C-terminal residue of the polysaccharide chains of human glycoproteins in most cases is a sialic acid residue, but plants lack a sialylation mechanism. Plants also synthesize glycans, which contain residues of sugars such as xylose, rhamnose, and arabinose [8] that are not typical for human glycoproteins. Polysaccharide chains of plant glycans contain \u03b2-1,2-xylose and \u03b1-1,3-fucose residues in lateral branches, whereas xylose residues are absent in mammalian glycans and fucose is present in the form of \u03b1-1,6-fucose. Finally, mucin-type O-glycosylation, which is characteristic for many secreted mammalian glycoproteins, is not operating in plants [117] . Thus, differences in the glycosylation mechanism of plants and humans can lead to a loss of the biological function of recombinant products, reduce their half-life in the blood, and induce an immune response in the recipient organism [8, 111] .",

There are several strategies for changes to the posttranslational modification of the recombinant protein expressed in plants that contribute to the production of a structure close to the native form. One promising approach is to modify the recombinant protein by the attachment of the KDEL amino acid sequence, which is responsible for protein localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, to the C-terminal residue. This prevents targeting of the protein in the Golgi apparatus, where specific plant fucosyl-and xylosyltransferases are localized, and results in the production of a structure of the glycoside residue of the recombinant protein similar to the structure to the human protein. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is impossible to direct the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the other cellular compartments or for secretion into the culture medium. In this case, the cell-destruction stage for product recovery becomes mandatory [111] . Recombinant IL-10 was produced in rice plants by this method [93] .",

For a long time, the low level of heterologous protein synthesis prevented the commercialization of plant systems for the production of biopharmaceutical products, but the achievements of the last decade have substantially improved their productivity. The use of transient or transplastomic expression and effective promoters, as well as the optimization of codons and cultivation of cells in suspension culture, significantly increases the yield of recombinant protein. Directing the recombinant protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and the vacuole as a result of the attachment of the signal of intracellular transport to the protein also makes it possible to avoid proteolysis and glycosylation via pathways specific for plants that are different from the human pathway, contributing to the improvement of synthesis efficiency. Decreased intracellular enzyme activity via knockout of the corresponding genes or coexpression of proteinase inhibitors was also used to increase the target protein yield. Modifications of transgenic bioreactor plants that change the system of post-translational modification of the protein allows the production of complex recombinant animal and human glycoproteins most similar to native types in terms of biological activity and allergic reactions. A major success in the production of plants with humanized expression system has been achieved for such model plants as Arabidopsis, tobacco, and Physcomitrella patens. The first steps for the modification of glycosylation systems of cereals and legumes, which are the most efficient producers, were taken.",

At the present time, our understanding the nature of many diseases of the immune system has contributed to a significant increase in the global demand for cytokines, which are used for the treatment of a wide range of socially significant oncology, infectious, immunodeficiency diseases, and other conditions [38] . The introduction of the first plant recombinant cytokine, Locteron\u00ae, into the market [104] clears the path for further development of this field of pharmacology. To date, the synthesis of representatives of almost all families of cytokines preserving their biological activity was performed with transgenic plants. New technologies of genome editing and strategies for increasing the level of expression of recombinant proteins in plants offer opportunities for low-cost, large-scale production of cytokines with improved product quality and posttranslational modifications of the type characteristic for humans and the higher animals.
