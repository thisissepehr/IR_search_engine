The PLPV genomic RNA comprises 3884 nt and contains six open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding proteins of 27 (p27), 13 (p13), 87 (p87), 7 (p7), 6 (p6), and 37 kDa (p37), respectively. The arrangement of these ORFs on the PLPV genome closely resembles that of members of the genus Carmovirus in the family Tombusviridae and, moreover, most of the putative PLPV gene products showed high identity with proteins of this viral group. However, several striking differences were noticed. Carmoviruses generate two subgenomic RNAs whereas PLPV produces a single one. In addition, only p7 showed similarity with movement proteins of carmoviruses whereas p6 (as p13) has no viral (or other) homologs. This protein might be expressed from a noncanonical start codon or, alternatively, through a \u22121 frameshift (FS) mechanism. Both, the production of one subgenomic RNA and the likely involvement of a \u22121 FS for expression of an internal ORF parallel the translation strategies reported for the unique species of the genus Panicovirus, belonging also to the family Tombusviridae.

This virus may induce the appearance of yellow/green spots and line patterns on the leaves of the affected plants leading to significant quality deterioration [42, 43] . In Spain, a survey done on approximately one thousand geranium samples collected from different regions of the country revealed the presence of PLPV in more than 50% of the tested scions (M. Borja, personal communication). This situation is probably similar to that existing in other countries where this ornamental crop has been largely cultivated, as studies made in the nineties showed a high incidence of PLPV in the Netherlands and Israel [4, 11] .

This is most likely due to the poor characterization of PLPV and of other small isometric viruses infecting geranium which, as a consequence, has led to some controversies about their identity and to a confusing nomenclature [4, 18, 19, 27, 41, 43] .

The PLPV genomic RNA consists of 3884 nt and contains six open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 1 ). The first ORF potentially encodes a protein of 27 kDa (p27). This ORF(p27) begins at AUG (nt 7-9) in a favourable translation context (CAAAAUGGCAC), with an A at position \u22123 and a G at position +4 (23, 28) , and terminates at an UAG codon (nt 727-729). If this amber codon is read-through, the ORF extends to a downstream UAA (nt 2302-2304) giving rise to a protein of 87 kDa. Both p27 and p87 present homology with proteins of members of the family Tombusviridae (Table 1 ) which have been shown of PLPV and PMV, respectively, might be translated from non-canonical initiation codons. A \u22121 frameshift (FS) event could be required for the generation of the putative p7-FS and p8-FS proteins of PLPV and PMV, respectively. These potential frameshift products would have an N-terminus corresponding to p7 (for PLPV) or p8 (for PMV), and a C-terminus corresponding to almost the complete p6 (for PLPV) or the complete p6.6 (for PMV) to be involved in replication [1, 14, 55] and, moreover, p87 contains the motifs characteristic of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) including the highly conserved GDD box [22] . Another ORF, starting at AUG (nt 530-532, in the context CCGGAUGAAAA) and ending at UAA (nt 911-913), is nested between ORFs (p27) and (p87) and potentially encodes a protein of 13 kDa (p13) that is unique to this virus. A small centrally located ORF begins at AUG (nt 2274-2276, in the context UCGAAUGGAUA) and stops at UGA (nt 2463-2465), and may encode a protein of about 7 kDa (p7) which exhibits high identity with movement proteins from species of the family Tombusviridae, especially with those of the genus Carmovirus (Table 1 ). In this PLPV putative product, a domain adopting a characteristic \u03b1-helix, similar to that able to bind RNA in the p7 of CarMV (29), can be predicted (data not shown). An additional small ORF, overlapping ORF(p7), potentially encodes a protein of 6 kDa (p6) which does not show clear similarity with any viral (or other) protein. This ORF might be expressed from a noncanonical start codon, AUU (nt 2441-2443, in the context UGGAAUUUGUG), and/or by a \u22121 frameshift (FS) mechanism which would lead to the production of a 12 kDa fusion protein (p12 or p7-FS). Supporting the latter possibility, an heptanucleotide is found immediately upstream of the stop codon of ORF(p7) whose sequence (Fig. 2) fits the canonical frameshifting motifs (5, 6) .

PLPV genome is not predicted to code for a product homologue of the second movement protein of carmoviruses and presents, instead, a small ORF which potentially encodes a polypeptide, p6, with no clear similarity to any viral protein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 551, "end": 555, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 556, "end": 559, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In addition, only one subgenomic RNA seems to be produced for translation of downstream PLPV ORFs, whereas carmoviruses generate two subgenomic RNAs for expression of the movement proteins and the CP, respectively [39] . The ORF(p13) is also unique to PLPV although its location on the viral genome is similar to that of the novel ORF(p23) of Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot carmovirus which encodes a protein indispensable for host specific replication [26] . Database searches have not demonstrated similarities between the putative PLPV p13 and any known protein and, moreover, computer-aided sequence analysis has not revealed any motif in p13 which could provide an insight about its function. Hence, the biological significance of p13, if produced in infected plants, is yet to be determined. Caution is required when the possible translation events on RNA are deduced only from sequence data but should all proteins potentially encoded by PLPV be produced in vivo, the virus must use a variety of mechanisms for expression of its genes. Translation of PLPV ORFs (p27) and (p87) will probably occur from the genomic RNA involving a read-through mechanism in the case of ORF(p87), as demonstrated for related ORFs of members of the family Tombusviridae [16, 40, 48, 55] . Indeed, the sequence surrounding the amber stop codon of ORF(p27) is AAA-UAG-GGA, which is consistent with the consensus sequence required for efficient read-through AA(A/G)-UAG-G(G/U)(G/A) [16] . In the case of ORF(p13), an internal ribosomal entry is likely for its translation because the optimal sequence context of the initiation codon of ORF(p27) makes its expression via a leaky scanning mechanism unlikely [12] . The remaining downstream ORFs may be translated from the abundant 1.6 kb subgenomic RNA detected in PLPV infected plants. ORF(p7) would be expressed by conventional ribosomal scanning whereas ORF(p6) might be translated from a non-canonical start codon by leaky scanning and/or by a \u22121 FS mechanism giving rise to a p12 fusion protein (p7-FS). This also distinguishes PLPV from carmoviruses, whose small internal ORFs present canonical initiation codons and are presumably translated by a leaky scanning mechanism, with the exception of Melon necrotic spot virus for which a readthrough event has been predicted [38] . While we cannot exclude the production of a subgenomic RNA accumulating to very low amounts for the CP gene's expression, over exposure of the Northern blots did not reveal such potential RNA species. Thus, a leaky scanning mechanism or an internal ribosomal entry may account for its translation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 218, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 450, "end": 454, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1258, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1262, "text": "40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1263, "end": 1266, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1270, "text": "55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1467, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1691, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2306, "end": 2310, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Interestingly, the arrangement and predicted expression strategies of the ORFs on the PLPV subgenomic RNA parallel those proposed for the unique subgenomic RNA of Panicum mosaic virus (PMV), the sole member of the genus Panicovirus in the family Tombusviridae, with the exception of an additional ORF overlapping the CP gene within PMV (Fig. 1) [48] . Both subgenomic RNAs have a region upstream of the CP gene devoid of AUG codons except for the one opening the 5 proximal ORF which, moreover, has not an optimal translation context. Furthermore, the proposed \"shifty\" heptanucleotide of PLPV is identical in sequence and in an equivalent position to one found immediately upstream of the stop codon of the PMV ORF(p8) (Fig. 2) , thus reinforcing the hypothesis of the production of a frameshift fusion protein. Attempts to detect the putative PMV p8-FS in vivo have failed however [49] . In contrast, in vitro translation assays have demonstrated that the non-canonical start codon of PMV ORF(p6.6) is active despite its suboptimal initiation context (CUAGUGG). Subsequent mutagenesis experiments have shown this ORF is required for efficient infection in plants [49] . Despite not share clear sequence similarity, the PMV p6.6 and the potential PLPV p6, also presumably translated from a non-canonical codon in a suboptimal context, do have similar hydrophobicity profiles and, moreover, resemble those of the p9 movement proteins of carmoviruses (data not shown). Only one membranespanning domain however is predicted in the PMV p6.6 and the PLPV p6 whereas the carmovirus proteins contain two transmembrane segments [53] .

The characterization of these viruses has been mainly based on their biological/physicochemical properties and serological relationships, raising questions as to their taxonomy and status as distinct virus species [4, 18, 19, 27, 41, 43] . This has been further complicated by designating the same virus with different names, for example PLPV, which was formerly known as Pelargonium ring pattern virus [4] . Information on the genomic organization of these pathogens will undoubtedly shed light on this issue. The primary structures of PFBV, a carmovirus, and of PNSV, a proposed new species of the genus Tombusvirus, have been recently reported [15, 37] . In addition, some authors have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of other pelargonium viruses such as PCRPV, PelRSV and also PLPV [20] but have not made the data public. Recently, the genomic organization of PCRPV which potentially encodes five proteins very similar to those involved in replication (p27 and p87), movement (p7 and p9) and encapsidation (p37) in the genus Carmovirus has been described [21] . Interestingly, PCRPV resembles PLPV in producing a single subgenomic RNA for expression of downstream ORFs and in the likely involvement of a \u22121 FS mechanism for translation of the second small internal ORF. It has been suggested that such traits are also shared by PelRSV and ELV [21] and, based on these common features and sequence similarities, it has been proposed to place the four viruses in a new genus within the family Tombusviridae for which the name Pelarspovirus has been advanced [21] . Only the CP sequences of PCRPV, PelRSV and ELV are available and show high identity with that of PLPV (44, 48 and 50%, respectively).
